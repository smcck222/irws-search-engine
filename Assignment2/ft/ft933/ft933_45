FT  07 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Crime, justice and efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WISDOM of the 352 recommendations in yesterday's report from the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice should be assessed by the extent to which
they will reduce the miscarriages of justice that have discredited Britain's
criminal justice system. Although the scope of the inquiry has rightly been
broadened to address other aspects of public unease, it was launched
following the overturned convictions of the Maguire Seven, the Guildford
Four and the Birmingham Six. Restoring confidence in the criminal justice
system is vital not only in the battle against crime in the UK, but also in
convincing other countries that they can co-operate with the British
authorities in pursuing criminals.
Thus the recommendation that an independent tribunal be set up to review
alleged miscarriages of justice is welcome. So, too, is the loosening of the
restrictions on what may be considered by the Appeal Court in reviewing a
case. These proposals should ensure that discredited convictions can in
future be overturned more speedily than the 16 years taken with the
Birmingham Six.
However, dealing with alleged miscarriages should be the final step in
ensuring that justice is done. More important are measures to reduce the
chances of mistakes in the first place. That means overhauling the process
by which crimes are investigated and convictions obtained. At present, the
police are under pressure to clear up crimes by finding a culprit and
extracting a confession, sometimes with inadequate corroborative evidence.
The string of miscarriages has made juries suspicious of the police and
reluctant to convict on such evidence.
Interrogation techniques
Rectifying this means shifting the emphasis from securing a conviction,
however unsatisfactory. Some of the commission's recommendations will assist
in this. For example, opening up forensic evidence to the defence should
encourage more objective examination of this specialist material, which is
often crucial to a case. Better training for the police in interrogation
techniques would reduce the number of confessions that later turn out to be
groundless. A more rigorous approach to identification of suspects will
ensure that the defence learns about witnesses who have failed to identify
the accused.
However, other recommendations made by the commission are less convincing
and could further reduce public confidence in the system. In particular, the
removal of the right to a jury trial seems ill-judged when there is so much
concern about the criminal justice process. The rationale for the
recommendation is that defendants who opt for trial by jury often end up
pleading guilty and receiving the same sentence that would have been imposed
by the magistrates' court. In some cases, their motive is to delay the day
of reckoning, in others, the mistaken belief that they are more likely to be
acquitted. But such behaviour can be deterred by offering lighter sentences
for early guilty pleas - a form of plea bargaining that the commission
sensibly advocates.
Adversarial approach
Similarly, requiring the defence to disclose its case before trial is an odd
recommendation for a justice system which is based on the adversarial
approach. Under such a system, it is the duty of the prosecution to prove
the guilt of the accused and of the defence to throw doubt upon the
prosecution's case. One option considered was a switch to the inquisitorial
approach used in countries such as France, where judges supervise the
prosecution case and the defence's duty is to co-operate in establishing the
truth. Since the commission rejected switching to an inquisitorial system,
requiring the defence to disclose its case appears to be seeking the best of
both systems - potentially at the expense of the accused.
Indeed, many of the commission's recommendations seem more concerned with
improving the likelihood of securing convictions than with restoring public
confidence. It is certainly the case that locking up genuine criminals is as
important as not locking up those who have been wrongly accused. However, it
is clear that mistrust of the police and the courts is important in reducing
the effectiveness of the system. By becoming more concerned with efficiency
than justice, the commission may have missed an opportunity to improve both.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be no such thing as bad publicity but 3i, Europe's largest venture
capital company, has decided that enough is enough. Battered by reports of
its on-off flotation and bruised by comment about its inability to keep a
chairman, it has decided that its image needs management.
Charles Richardson, 39, who has worked for 3i for 12 years and is currently
regional director for the north and Scotland, has been appointed 3i's first
director of corporate affairs.
Hard to know whether this is a promotion or a sideways move for Richardson.
But there is rather less ambiguity about the role of Shandwick, whose
long-term relationship with 3i has been one of the few fixtures in the
fickle pr world. Dewe Rogerson, brought in to handle 3i's much delayed
flotation, seems to be emerging as the senior media adviser, which must be
all rather humiliating for what used to be the world's biggest pr company.
After all it was 3i which gave Shandwick its first big break in business.

Is it the sun, or is it to keep out the peeping toms from across the square?
Whatever the reason, US investment banker Morgan Stanley seems intent on
reversing the trend towards greater transparency in Britain's financial
markets by shrouding its affairs in secrecy.
It is replacing the windows of its Cabot Square headquarters, in London's
Canary Wharf, with reflective glass panes. As a result Morgan's rivals
across the Square at Credit Suisse First Boston will no longer be able to
train their binoculars on the firm's innermost secrets. Expect CSFB to
follow suit.

<TEXT>
Tristan Garel-Jones may have made himself frightfully unpopular with the
opponents of Maastricht, but he went down pretty well in Latin America where
they were notably less sensitive about the minister's role in guiding the
treaty through the house.
So his departure from the foreign office in the May cabinet reshuffle
appeared to leave a gap in the British government, which is trying to cosy
up to Latin America now the continent's economic performance is looking up.
Into the breach, however, steps chief secretary to the treasury Michael
Portillo. Also a fluent Spanish speaker, Portillo is at this very moment on
a trip to Mexico and Chile with a group of British businessmen in search of
export and investment opportunities.
At first blush, Portillo's direct treasury style might look a trifle dull
beside the flamboyant Garel-Jones and his trade-mark cape. But Portillo does
have some things going for him. A taste for the good life  - and a liking
for the odd glass of champagne - never goes down badly with Latin American
elites. And, though he's on the political right, Portillo has other bases
covered. His father fought against Franco in the Spanish civil war and there
are plenty of Franco exiles scattered all over Latin America.

John Garrett, the Labour MP for Norwich South, is probably the only
management consultant sitting on the Labour benches. But he's better known
for banging on about how the only people who are doing well in Britain's
civil service are white, male, public school, Oxbridge arts graduates.
Indeed, his fixation with the subject is so well known that William
Waldegrave, who doubles up as a fellow of All Souls and Citizens' Charter
minister, had no difficulty earning a cheap point at yesterday's select
committee hearing on the civil service.
Cross-examined by Garrett about the percentage of top civil servants from
Oxbridge, Waldegrave noted that the ratio of Garrett's fellow committee
members who went to Oxbridge was far greater than in the case of permanent
secretaries.

Hard to believe that but a month ago, Rolls-Royce reigned supreme on the

in a glorious open-topped model.
No such treatment for Britain's prime minister yesterday, however. John
Major was able to kiss goodbye to any pipe-dreams involving a
Japanese-inspired renaissance of his country's motor trade when, touching
down for the G7 summit, he was promptly shovelled into a splendid, er,
Mercedes Benz.
Why, exclaimed anguished UK expats, the Japanese government could at least
have produced a Nissan, Toyota or Honda, all of which are now made in the UK
as well as Japan. As does much these days, it apparently all boils down to
security. The German tank seemingly possessed the requisite heavy armour
plating.  Fortunately, Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, kept
the flag flying by arriving in the British ambassodor's Rolls-Royce.

FT  07 JUL 93 / A shifting market to test their metal: German unions are
trying to build a consensus while protecting their national rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's IG Metall, the world's most powerful trade union, is an
unsentimental organisation. Six weeks ago, its charismatic leader, Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, was brought down by charges of insider trading. At a national
conference on the future of pay bargaining one month later in Frankfurt his
name was not mentioned once.
But the conference did more than emphasise that it is business as usual for
Germany's 3.3m-strong engineering union. It also signalled that Germany's
industrial relations system, battered by the deepest economic crisis since
the war, is groping back towards the rational and consensual habits for
which it was once admired.
The message to his members from 54-year-old Mr Klaus Zwickel, the new
president of IG Metall, is clear: 'For the next few years the room for
manoeuvre on wages is going to be very limited.' Union influence, he says,
should be diverted into extending worker participation and influencing job
structures. 'Above all the new priority for our members is securing jobs,'
he adds.
But here, too, Mr Zwickel is coldly realistic. He is armed with the hard
facts about industry's plans for lay-offs and restructuring from union
members who sit on the boards of Germany's biggest companies. Mr Zwickel
accepts that German industry faces 'deep structural problems' and that
manufacturing employment will fall 'sharply'.
This is not just conciliatory rhetoric after a period of unusually direct
industrial confrontation. As German manufacturing sheds thousands of jobs
every week, pushing unemployment to 3.27m last month, the union is not
protesting or threatening strikes, as its UK counterparts did with little
success in the early 1980s. Confronted by rising dole queues, the unions
have moderated their pay claims.
April's engineering industry pay rise of 3 per cent will probably mean a
small fall in real incomes for most IG Metall members this year.
For Mr Zwickel and the German unions, it is a time for consolidation and
even for tactical retreat, exemplified by recent IG Metall decisions to
allow weekend working at one plant and a curtailment of benefits at a few
others.
Yet the unions are operating from a position of relative strength. In the
1980s, while organised labour was in retreat throughout the industrialised
world, union membership levels in Germany held firm at about 35 per cent.
German workers also moved to the top of the world's hourly pay league and,
thanks to IG Metall's successful campaign for the 35-hour week, now work the
fewest hours per year of all industrialised nations.
The success story was crowned at the beginning of the 1990s by the wholesale
transportation to east Germany of the west German industrial relations
model: national bargaining and strong, industry-based unions combined with
legally-backed works councils (with wide veto powers over management
decisions) and workers on the board at company level.
Such was the hold of the consensus model and the commitment to unification
that German employers agreed in 1991 to equalise wages between east and west
by 1994.
Two years later the whole deal threatened to fall apart. The engineering
industry employers tried unilaterally to revoke the wage deal. IG Metall,
led by the physically imposing figure of Mr Zwickel, denounced the move as
an attempt by the employers to use east Germany to try to break the entire
national bargaining system and ultimately to bring down wage costs in the
west. On May 3, he called his members out on strike.
'It was the first time in postwar German history that the employers had torn
up an agreement,' Mr Zwickel says, his booming voice shaking with emotion at
the memory. He maintains that both sides knew the real issue was not how
quickly wages should be equalised but the sanctity of national agreements
covering wages and conditions - what Mr Zwickel calls 'the living nerve of
the German unions'.
Union officials admit privately that equalisation of wages creates problems
in an area like east Germany where there are huge differences in
productivity between old and new plants. Some east German plants have
productivity as low as 30 per cent of the west German average while, for
example, General Motors' Eisenach plant has 150 per cent of western
productivity.
When the IG Metall strike ended three weeks later, the union agreed to a
delay until 1996 in the wage equalisation goal. Crucially, it also accepted
'hardship clauses', allowing loss-making companies to opt out of the deal if
the union agreed.
Preserving the overall agreement in Germany, even with a two-year delay, was
a timely triumph for Mr Zwickel, a 'metalworkers metalworker'. He organised
the strike with real unemployment close to 50 per cent in east Germany. Most
members in the east were more concerned with job security than seemingly
arcane 'western' arguments about national agreements.
Mr Zwickel's direct and rather puritanical manner appealed to the rank and
file in the east in a way that Mr Steinkuhler's suave and haughty style did
not.
For the new, more aggressive generation of German business leaders, Mr
Zwickel will be just as formidable an opponent as his predecessor,
especially as the union tries to push into new, white-collar areas to
compensate for a shrinking blue-collar base.
Many of those employers believe that the more conciliatory noises emerging
recently from IG Metall's glass box headquarters in Frankfurt are too
little, too late. Some employers are already seeking more flexible local
deals outside the central bargaining system, although most want to stay with
the national agreement. The unwritten rule that wages rise in line with
prices, plus a share of productivity, has served many of them well.
But many employers now argue there must be further decentralisation and
labour flexibility if Germany is to compete, pointing to the yawning
difference in wage costs in Germany and elsewhere in Europe: hourly wages in
Hungary (in D-Mark terms) are one-tenth the German level and in Estonia
one-hundredth. Mr Zwickel retorts that the German system fosters high skill
and adaptability and, that on unit labour costs - combining costs and
productivity - Germany is still cheaper than Britain, France and Italy and
only slightly dearer than the US and Japan.
Even if Germany can remain competitive with western rivals, the attractions
of low-wage eastern Europe mean that German companies are already moving
jobs and investments east. The fear is, therefore, that Germany is now
seeing not just recession-related job losses, but also more permanent
structural unemployment.
Mr Zwickel dismisses the current demand by employers for a return to the
40-hour week, which he claims would increase unemployment by 800,000.
Employer pressure to hold down the wages of unskilled labour and to
negotiate at the plant level with more company-friendly works councils
rather than the national union may be more difficult to resist.
Works councils are usually dominated by union members, but have been ahead
of the national union in backing flexible working time arrangements. Thanks
to that flexibility, the union can now boast that, as the working week has
been cut, the running time of machines has actually increased. Mr Zwickel
says that many employers have failed to exhaust the existing flexibility on
working time.
'We reject a debate which is focused only on labour costs because we believe
that 70 to 80 per cent of our problems stem from encrusted management
structures,' says Mr Zwickel, who is keen to improve product quality with
'intelligent' team-working. He is not always sweet reason. The 12 requests
by companies to implement the 'hardship' clauses and thus to escape the
overall wage agreement in east Germany have been rejected by the union. Six
of them have now been ruled as justified by arbitrators - it is up to the
union to decide if it accepts the ruling.
IG Metall may have held the line so far on its national agreements, but
pressures on the union will remain intense. The union is at the cutting edge
of the restructuring challenge facing the whole of German industry. It is
not only German industry and the employers that have to adapt, IG Metall has
to learn to juggle its inclination towards consensus and its desire to
preserve traditional collective bargaining rights.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Personal View: Solutions for a little local difficulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIR JOHN BANHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The town crier was in action in the city of York last month, celebrating the
prospect of the return of the Ridings - Yorkshire's historic boundaries -
and of the city once again having control over a greater part of its own
affairs. It has been a similar story in Bristol and on Teesside, while in
Lincolnshire there is probably quite quiet (naturally) satisfaction that
there need be no change in the present local government arrangements.
There is thus a serious risk that the review of the structure of local
government in rural England will end up doing some popular things. But
popularity is not necessarily a recipe for sound public administration. And
the councillors whose futures are threatened have been quick to criticise
the Local Government Commission for England's proposals and to hire
expensive lobbyists to convince local people to reject them.
The commission has clear objectives: to correct any mistakes that were made
in the last reorganisation in 1974; to streamline the confusing and wasteful
two-tier system of district and county councils - there is considerable
overlap of functions and few people know who is responsible for what (or,
indeed, who their local councillors are); and, most important, to equip
local government to meet the challenges of the early decades of the next
century.
In the words of a recent FT leading article ('Local counsel', June 17), this
will require a system of local government capable of strategic action, and
which combines local delivery of services with genuine electoral
accountability.
In the British way of doing things, we are only looking at the structure and
boundaries of local government in rural England, not the way the new
authorities are to be managed, nor how they will be financed. But, despite
the obvious dangers in such a fragmented approach, useful progress has been
made - even if we have not been able to 'reinvent local government', to
borrow the fashionable transatlantic phrase.
In less than a year, we have examined five different areas with a combined
population greater than that of Scotland. The 75 councils now involved spend
more than Pounds 6bn a year - some three times the current budget of the
Department of Trade and Industry - and they employ some 200,000 people.
In each area, we have sought to balance the sometimes conflicting
requirements of community identity and interests, convenient and effective
local services and costs. Our recommendations are based on people's stated
feelings about where they belong. And we have put a range of structural
choices to local people, recognising that any new structure must be grounded
in popular understanding and support.
If our recommendations find favour with local people, the government and
parliament, there will be 24 new unitary local authorities replacing 66
county and district councils. There will have been a reduction in indirect
costs compared with the present arrangements of some 10-12 per cent, worth
some Pounds 80m a year, or around Pounds 35 for every household. The average
new authority will have a population of around 250,000, although some will
be relatively small with populations of less than 100,000 and a few will be
quite large - though still smaller than the county council areas they
replace.
We have been dangerously open about our method and approach. We think that a
unitary structure is generally to be preferred to the existing two-tier
system; but we recommended no change where the system seems to work well. We
have not invariably chosen the lowest cost structure; but we have not put
forward recommendations that will add to the present cost of bureaucracy in
the areas in question, since all the evidence suggests that this would be
unacceptable to local people.
And far from local democracy going out of the window, there will be an
improvement in democratic oversight compared with the present county
councils, an enhanced consultative role for local (town and parish)
councils, and maximum possible devolution of day-to-day management to the
community level.
As we near the end of the first round of our work, several lessons are
clear. People care much more deeply about their local government than is
generally believed; we have been receiving as many as a thousand letters a
day from a single review area.
There are few obviously right answers; in many places, the arguments between
the alternatives are finely balanced. This is a time of great potential
opportunity for English local government. But it could all too easily be
lost in the morass of institutional politics - powerful vested interests are
not going to go 'quietly into the night'.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Letter: Competitive companies are the key to removing
unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN HORAM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As Samuel Brittan says (Economic Viewpoint, July 1) in commenting on
the prime minister's remarks in Copenhagen and my own pamphlet, Making
Britain Competitive, the units that compete in world trade are companies,
not nations. Quite so.
Nevertheless, as, among others, Michael Porter, in his book The Competitive
Advantage of Nations, points out: 'The national economic environment does
have a central role in determining the success of companies.' Compare, for
example, the performance of major car companies in Japan, the US, Germany
and the UK.
One of the most important points in my pamphlet was that the countries where
the highest growth has been achieved postwar have been those such as Japan
and South Korea, which have both a market economy and a government that
gives top priority to improving the competitive environment.
The market-led reforms of the 1980s brought about a huge improvement to
Britain, but the government policymaking process still needs a lot of
attention. In particular it needs better co-ordination, economic policies
better designed to help business and a more skilful approach in areas where
the government itself is responsible.
For example, since good policy starts with proper information and analysis,
I suggest that a government-wide competitiveness unit should be established.
This should report to a cabinet committee on competitiveness, chaired by the
prime minister and including the president of the board of trade, the
chancellor of the exchequer, the chief secretary and the secretary of state
for education, who would also be responsible for training. All economic
decisions such as the shape of the budget should be looked at by this
committee. This would give a competitiveness strategy proper priority and
improve co-ordination.
Interestingly enough, it was also reported in your July 1 issue ('Treasury
boosts help for business') that the Treasury is to set up a new unit to
explore ways that it can improve industrial competitiveness. This shows the
thinking is moving in the right direction, though it also betrays the fact
that the government is still too departmentalised. The Department of Trade
and Industry already has a competitiveness unit, so here we have another set
up by the Treasury. I advocate one for the government as a whole.
Samuel Brittan admits that, if relevant competitiveness is not the
explanation for the differing economic performance of nations, there has to
be some other. He advocates changes in the labour market and pay and he
concludes: 'If there is to be a return to full employment, much more effort
will have to be made by employers to find pay rates at which jobs can be
offered.'
I disagree. Pay is only part of the equation. I think we will not return to
full employment until we have more of the competitive companies that have
developed in the UK in the last 12 years. Japan has more and it has low
unemployment. National economic policy should be directed towards improving
the competitive environment.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Bogey word for EC: Europe's magnetic pull often promotes
Balkanisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personally I have always felt attracted to the Balkans - influenced,
perhaps, by memories of the exotic Balkan Sobranie cigarettes my mother used
to smoke. But 'Balkanisation' has long been a bogey word for west Europeans.
It is what happens when large empires fragment into small and squabbling
mini-states: impotence, frustration, bloodshed - and all in a context of
complexity with which world statesmen, not to mention their electorates,
soon lose patience.
Until two or three years ago it was a rather dated bogey word, referring
mainly to things that happened in 1914 or earlier. Now, alas, it is all too
topical. The break-up of Yugoslavia has been a classic case of Balkanisation
right there in the Balkans. The rest of the Balkan peninsula - generally
understood to include Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and the European
part of Turkey - has come to be seen mainly as the wider theatre in which
the Yugoslav tragedy is being played, and which might go up in flames if the
fire on stage is not quickly put out, or at least contained.
Needless to say, this state of affairs is not good for the region, even
those parts of it that have so far been spared direct involvement. Their
trade is distorted by sanctions and by the disruption of transit routes,
notably the Danube. Insecurity discourages foreign investment. And political
leaders, too, tend to discriminate against the region. They give priority to
central Europe - which is closer and seems more hopeful - or to Russia,
because of its manifest strategic importance and vast natural resources.
With a mixture of guilt and exasperation, they regard the Balkans as an area
where they must struggle to contain the war, but there is nothing else to be
done.
What western Europe most fears about the Balkans is that it might itself be
contaminated and Balkanised. That is what happened, according to most west
European diagnoses, in 1914; and if there is one thing the EC still feels
entitled to congratulate itself on, in a Balkan context, it is that it has
preserved its unity in the Yugoslav conflict, albeit a unity of
near-paralysis, in spite of deep disagreements among its members.
You can well imagine, therefore, that a meeting last weekend in Corfu on
'the European Community and the Balkans', co-sponsored by the Commission
with two semi-official Greek think-tanks, and attended by people from all
the Balkan states, old and new, was not an entirely smooth or joyous affair.
The people from Brussels tried not to sound patronising, but almost always
failed. The people from the Balkans avoided, to a surprising extent,
rehearsing their local quarrels. Instead they joined in a united litany of
complaint, accusing western Europe of everything from impeding capitalist
development in the Balkans in the 19th century to discriminating against
them in the kind of agreements it is prepared to negotiate in the late 20th.
Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro, who as Portuguese foreign minister
presided over the EC's abortive effort to prevent the war in Bosnia last
year, was obliged to make an almost ritual act of contrition for that
failure, while pleading that, if it were to do better in future, the EC must
have 'a credible back-up capacity' - ie, a military one, provided by the
Western European Union, or failing that by Nato.
'Who is to blame?' asked Nikolai Todorov from Sofia, voicing the almost
unanimous anger of the region. 'Who should take the burden of responsibility
for what is going on in the Balkans today? What are we up against -
'Balkanisation' or 'Europeanisation'?'
Europeanisation of the Balkans? It sounds the opposite of what is happening,
but I think I see what Mr Todorov means, or might mean. The EC congratulates
itself on its powers of integration internally, and the 'magnetic
attraction' it exercises on those around it. What has not been sufficiently
noted is that this powerful magnetic pull tends to provoke the
disintegration of other federal or co-operative structures in the
neighbourhood.
The EC may preach local and regional co-operation, but the audience is not
interested. What the audience sees is a rich and powerful club, membership
of which eclipses the value of any local association. Every nation or
potential nation, if not every individual, starts to think how it could get
in and how, above all, it must not be held back by association with less
wholesome or less fortunate neighbours.
This is not a purely Balkan phenomenon. Czechs have dissociated themselves
from Slovaks, and are not happy even about being bracketed with Hungarians
and Poles. The latter in turn insist that they are central Europeans, who
must not be lumped together with others further east or south. Balts are
determined to be in a different category from Ukrainians, and Ukrainians
from Russians. But 'Balkan' is also a category no one wants to belong to, as
a Slovene speaker in Corfu made tactlessly clear. 'Slovenia,' he said, 'will
not take part in anything that pulls our country back, or puts it into a
marginal group.'
One cannot blame the EC for something that is the inevitable consequence of
its success. But it could have done more to counteract it. Rather than deal
with each country separately, on a 'hub and spoke' basis, it should have
done what the US did in 1947 when 'Balkan' tendencies in western Europe were
rampant. Get together, George Marshall told the Europeans: work out a joint
programme, and we will help you. 'Any government which manoeuvres to block
the recovery of other countries cannot expect help from us.' That is the
tone the EC should have taken in its dealings with the Balkans, and with
eastern Europe as a whole.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Letter: UK's 'rare breed' hit by computer tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms EILEEN CHAO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to echo the cry for scrapping tariffs in the computer
sector made by Mr G S Shingles, chairman of Digital Equipment (Letters, July
5).
We have just finished exhibiting in a leading UK computer show. We were
astonished at the responses we received when it was mentioned that we were a
UK company that designs and manufactures all its products in the UK.
Reactions ranged from raised eyebrows and looks of incredulity, to comments
like 'good luck to you' and 'good grief'.
It is sad that UK manufacturers in the computer industry are such a rare
species, and the high level of tariffs this government has imposed is a
major contributing factor.
Mr Shingles has focused on the UK computer industry's ability to compete in
the world computer market, but there is an even more urgent reason at home
for abolishing high tariffs in the computer sector. In the UK, local
manufacturers are facing competition from US and Far Eastern manufacturers,
which pay import duties of less than half those we pay on imported computer
parts that cannot be sourced in the UK. Unless this is changed, it is no
wonder that people should marvel at the purpose/logic behind a UK
manufacturer.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Dear David: shall I stay on at school? / Examining a
shake-up in the careers guidance offered to young people in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Astbury, training and development manager at British Gas Northern,
has strong views on the career guidance offered young people. He thinks much
of it is poor and anti - industry.
'Most of the officers from the Careers Service seem to have little
understanding of our industry, or industry in general,' he says. 'I think
they believe working for British Gas involves donning a pair of overalls and
walking around with a spanner. But we have a huge range of jobs on offer.'
Mr Astbury, like many fellow employers in the Confederation of British
Industry - where he sits on the education policy panel - has lobbied for
reform of careers education and guidance, currently provided partly by
schools and partly by the 6,000-strong Careers Service. The latter has an
annual budget of Pounds 135m and several client groups, including
schoolchildren, 16-to-19-year-olds on government training courses, and
employers.
The service will undergo a thorough overhaul over the next few years
following legislation last week which stripped local education authorities
of their statutory supervisory role. Responsibility for running career's
guidance will shift to the department of employment, which will introduce
competitive tenders for a franchised service. Instead of 116 Careers
Services run solely by LEAs, the government wants various local
organisations to provide a new patchwork of services for local communities.
Funding will still come from central government though the figure is not yet
fixed.
Interested observers, including the CBI and the Institute of Careers
Guidance, which represents careers officers, say the reform addresses some,
but not all, of their concerns about the quality of advice. A particular
worry is that guidance in school will not be improved by the changes because
it is not part of the new national curriculum which concentrates on core
academic subjects. They argue improvements in careers advice should span
both schools and the Careers Service.
What is clear, however, is that the service has moved from being a neglected
Cinderalla of local government to near the top of the political agenda as
employers have grown more concerned about the skill levels of UK workers.
Renewed interest in careers advice stems in significant part from a CBI
report, Towards a Skills Revolution, published in 1989. It argued skill
levels could be improved only if individuals were motivated to make the
fullest use of their talents. But the training and vocational system had
never put individuals first - the needs of providers had enjoyed higher
priority.
General recommendations on lifelong learning included specific calls for the
introduction of a system of credits which would give individuals a
publicly-funded right to post - 16 education or training. Critical to the
success of this scheme was high-quality careers guidance so that young
people received help in deciding whether to stay at school or take up a job
with training.
The influence of the CBI's ideas was evident in the government's 1991 white
paper, Education and Training for the 21st Century, which outlined its plans
for all 16 to 19-year-olds. By 1996, the paper announced, a watered-down
version of the CBI proposals. Training credits for those leaving full-time
education would be introduced.
The white paper contained proposals for raising the overall quality of the
Careers Service, drawing it closer to employers and forging new links with
employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils. Tecs were set up to
administer the government's publicly funded training programmes and increase
employers' commitment to training.
In tandem, the government also conducted an internal review of the Careers
Service though no report was published. Careers officers who saw the
findings say the government failed to make a case for reforming the service.
'It is difficult to judge whether the government was concerned to strip the
powers of LEAs or make a genuine privatisation,' said one.
The then-employment secretary, Mr Michael Howard, wrote to interested
parties asking for comments on options for the service, saying: 'The
introduction of market disciplines is needed to sharpen management practice,
which in some areas is below an acceptable standard.'
The result has been a wide-ranging reform, under which the employment
secretary, now Mr David Hunt, will choose how careers services should be
provided at the local level. For instance, he could decide to include local
education authority Careers Services working in partnership with other
organisations, such as Tecs, or he could exclude them entirely.
There are no prescribed models, although it is understood that the
government will look favourably at partnership arrangements that demonstrate
broad community support, particularly from employers. Services to the core
client groups will still be free but there could be a charge for 'bolt-on'
services, such as adult counselling.
Tecs, responsible for providing Youth Training places for young people, and
which also do pioneering work on adult guidance, are understood to be
lobbying hard for such partnerships. Many have already built voluntary
partnerships, with varying degrees of success, with their local LEAs.
The CBI, however, objects to Tecs being involved in franchise bids. Mr
Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, argues that they should not be
directly involved in providing careers' guidance; rather, they should be
strategic overseers of the setting up of local markets for advice.
This controversial suggestion has drawn criticism from several careers
officers, who would prefer to see the Tecs involved directly in the new
services. 'If there is a local market, who would advise the individual on
which provider of advice to go to?' asks Mr Allister McGowan, head of the
Careers Service in Hertfordshire.
Apart from specific worries about how the reforms will be implemented, many
careers officers are concerned about the threat to jobs. In Greater London,
for example, there is scope for a rationalisation of the 32 borough-led
careers services.
Mr McGowan said there was both uncertainty among careers' officers about
future employment prospects and concern over the quality of new providers.
However, the changes might enable the Careers Service to move more
effectively into new markets, particularly guidance to all age groups, he
said.
Local business people, he added, had a role to play - his LEA is setting up
a voluntary partnership with Hertfordshire Tec. If Hertfordshire is chosen
as one of 14 pilot schemes, from April next year, he said the arrangement
would probably be put on a more formal footing and a joint bid made for the
local franchise.
'We need to explore how we actually get employers involved in the delivery
of education and training,' he said. 'Teaching young people about work is
more than an employer offering to give a talk on spot-welding. It has to be
deeper and more sustained than that.'
A sustained commitment to careers' guidance might help young people make
better and more informed decisions about their working lives. A recent Audit
Commission report with the Office for Standards in Education found that more
than a third of 16 to 19-year-olds in full-time further education did not
complete their studies or attain the intended qualifications. The government
hopes its reforms will put an end to such discrepancies. If a period of
administrative chaos is necessary to enable young people to decide on which
skills they need to acquire, then the disruption will be worth it.
Mr Davies, of the CBI, said: 'We need higher skill levels in this country,
and an enhanced system of careers advice and guidance is central both to
achieving that objective and to ensuring that those skills match up with
appropriate labour market opportunities.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / Letter: Lessons not to be ignored on corporate venturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof DALE LITTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Lorenz (Management, July 2) highlights the renewed interest
in corporate venturing. This is supported by the significant number of
companies which, because of our research during the 1980s into new business
development, have been approaching us.
It is important that many of the lessons learned from those earlier, often
unsuccessful, attempts are not neglected.
The research pointed to a number of issues which need to be addressed. In
particular, it appears important to adopt evaluation, planning and control
approaches more appropriate to the special features of innovative, than of
mature, mainstream businesses. Careful attention to marketing must be
ensured from the initiation of any new venture as against assuming a
technology or product-based stance. There must also be clear responsibility
at a senior level for venturing activities, which should be considered as an
integral component of the strategic development of the company. And
venturing activities must work effectively with the major functions while at
the same time being insulated from the operational requirements of the firm.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Letter: Ashworth's research centres and academic chairs will
help LSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord DESAI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The news of John Ashworth's setbacks (Observer, 'Under review', June
25) needs to be put in perspective. While he may have lost County Hall and
his plan for top-up fees, he has already chalked up a number of successes.
One of these is the Centre for the Study of Global Governance, which is
funded by the World Humanity Action Trust. As its director, I can vouch for
the fact that it was John Ashworth's network as a natural scientist which
secured us the money. The same is true of the Principe d'Asturias chair in
Spanish Studies established with a donation of Pounds 500,000.
The Observer item appeared in the middle of a three-day conference on
Evolution and the Human Sciences. Not only had John Ashworth, as a
microbiologist, been instrumental in setting up this dialogue between
natural scientists, social scientists and philosophers, but he helped its
host, the London School of Economics philosophy department, secure from an
anonymous donor a 25-year, rent-free lease on a building in the vicinity of
the LSE. This will house the proposed All London Centre for the History and
Philosophy of Science.
Eventually research centres and academic chairs will help the LSE, whatever
happens to County Hall.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Arts: It's bad news week - again / Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to TS Eliot (an over-rated poet, yes, but you cannot deny the
strength of The Four Quartets), 'Human kind cannot bear very much reality'.
But Eliot died nearly 30 years ago, before television hit its stride. What
on earth would he have written, had he survived long enough to share our
nightly glut of reality in 1993?
The evidence of man's inhumanity to man is bad enough: whereas past
generations learned at second or third hand, and months or even years after
the event, about some hideous piece of cruelty on the other side of the
world, we hear and see and share vividly in such experiences within hours of
their occurrence. These days, television even ensures quite often that we
are present as the ghastliness takes place, whether in Bosnia, Israel, or
the City of London as the madmen of the IRA go about their mayhem.
However, just as destructive of the viewer's spirit is the way that
television pushes our noses up against equally vivid pictures showing the
cruelty not of man but of fate. Previous generations knew, of course, that
life is often nasty, brutish and short. They too lived with the mentally ill
'in the community', and consequently saw their suffering and, no doubt,
occasionally suffered from their violence. Naturally they watched their own
parents die and, more often than we have to, their own children, too. But at
least they could believe, when faced with such personal tragedies, that this
was an anomaly, that there was something better somewhere else.
Members of the television generation in countries such as Britain have no
such cushion against reality. We know how usual are pain and suffering,
because they are brought to us, day in, day out, from our own doorsteps and
from doorsteps around the world, in graphic pictures and detailed speech.
To live with the sadness and pain of your own life is one thing, but to try
to live with the sadness and pain of the whole world is something else. Half
a century into the age of television you begin to wonder whether this is
not, perhaps, insupportable. What we are trying to do in living with global
television is unlike anything that any previous generation has attempted.
It is not just, or even mainly, a question of television news, though Martyn
Lewis had more justice on his side than his derisive colleagues would admit
when he called for more 'good' news.
Anybody who has ever worked on a national news desk has felt that collegiate
tendency towards the macho which no one likes to question and which insists
that a murder is a 'better' story than, say, a world championship won by a
Briton in some supposedly obscure sport, champions in minor sports being one
of the specific examples of a void nominated by Lewis and carefully ignored
by his opponents.
Without toppling over into the embarrassing world of the 'Good News'
bulletin ('Two thousand aircraft didn't crash on take-off from Heathrow this
week. . .'), it is time somebody tried to break out of the self-perpetuating
circle of bad news junkies. Using the fashion editor as copy taster for a
week might help.
But however much the public may be on Lewis's side in this, viewers are
surely not surprised when news programmes reflect much of the nastiness of
the world. What becomes so dispiriting is the unending succession of current
affairs programmes and documentaries detailing the hurt and horror of life
everywhere. It is bad enough when this occurs where you expect it. Anyone
familiar with the extraordinary work of the late Juris Podnieks will have
known what sort of thing was likely to turn up in Channel 4's tribute,
Camera Of Courage.
Sure enough Sunday's Homeland was Podnieks' own cut of an amazing
documentary alternating between massed choirs of Latvian folk singers and
archive clips showing the invaders from Russia and Germany who have taken it
in turns to make Latvian life utter misery: 'Mother was a midwife. She
helped anyone in need, communist or guerrilla. For that, they forced her
into a freight wagon. . .' and deported her to the gulag where there are
still 200,000 unidentified corpses.
What does the man of conscience do against totalitarianism in the age of
television? He puts a video camera on his shoulder and heads for the sound
of gunfire. Working with Podnieks, cameramen Andris Slapins and Gvido
Zvaigzne both walked towards the Soviet tanks which circled the parliament
buildings of the Baltic states just a few summers ago, and both paid with
their lives. It is difficult to avoid tears as you watch the skewed pictures
which Zvaigzne's camera continued to record as he fell, hit by the
occupiers' bullets.
Equally predictable was the melancholy of BBC2's Black Daisies For The
Bride, a combination of documentary and drama to mark National Alzheimer's
Awareness Week. Director Peter Symes and poet Tony Harrison succeeded in
capturing most of the appalling characteristics of the disease, though they
did not emphasise enough the dreadful effects upon those most closely
related to the victim, usually husband or wife.
The account by The London Programme of violent schizophrenics being released
'into the community' and then committing murder was scarcely surprising; we
have heard already about these cases piecemeal. Most frightening was the
clear indication (though this was never explicit, it did not need to be)
that we now live in a democracy where it is considered more important to
save money than to avoid murder.
More depressing than these, however, are the programmes which you think will
be positive and heartening but which are not. Knowing Antony Thomas's
previous work, it was fair to assume that his Viewpoint 93 programme for ITV
called 'In Satan's Name' would direct a good blast of fresh air on the
subject of Satanic child abuse. Previous programmes with credulous reporting
from people such as Beatrix Campbell had helped turn a modern myth which
lacked even a scrap of evidence into a phenomenon widely believed by social
workers, clergymen and even members of the police force. Sure enough
Thomas's report revealed this international hysteria for what it is, but in
the process it made your heart sink even further.
Without ever mentioning the phrase 'false memory syndrome' Thomas showed
that these 'memories' of ritual abuse occur after sessions with
'psychotherapists' and church leaders. In other words this is the same old
witch hunting trick that we have seen down the ages: invent a set of demons,
introduce them to the minds of the impressionable, put pressure on the
impressionable in public and, hey presto, demons] To see the ease and
effectiveness with which this ancient technique is still being used, for the
self-aggrandisement of therapist and churchman, is deeply saddening.
But if in the past week you wanted the final push towards suicide you needed
to watch a two-hour programme in Channel 4's 'True Stories' series called
Time Indefinite. This began as one of those home movies made by American
members of the Me generation who believe that any aspect of their own lives
captured on camera must be fascinating to the rest of the world because -
well, it's about Me, isn't it? In the second half, however, Me's grandmother
died, Me's wife miscarried, and Me's father died, a series of blows from
fate which, in the end, seemed unfair even to such an insufferable egotist
as Me.
No viewer is forced to ingest such a concentrated diet, it is true. Even
television critics are entitled to opt for a comedy or a light entertainment
programme from time to time, assuming that in July they can still find one
that has not been shown umpteen times before. But unless you do sit down and
plan carefully to avoid it, you can find television bringing you more
reality than human kind can bear.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Arts: Separate Tables - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pleasing coincidence gives London revivals of plays by Noel Coward,
Terence Rattigan and John Osborne. Anyone who sees all three will, I hope,
begin to discard the belief that British theatre changed radically with the
opening of Osborne's Look Back in Anger at the Royal Court on May 8 1956.
For if you look at the playwrights as a group, it is their continuity that
stands out.
True, there was a change in the milieu - a move from the drawing room to the
ironing board. With Osborne's success, Rattigan went out of fashion and
Coward into decline. But there was no revolution.
The conventions remained pretty much the same, the aim being a well-made
play with a beginning, a middle and an end, and a capacity to shock thrown
in.
It was Osborne who was the conservative. He followed his masters closely,
but dropped such controversial subjects as drugs and homosexuality. The
difference was that he seemed to have moved the frontiers by writing about a
lower down a class in the social hierarchy and expressing anger at the
status quo. It was not until Inadmissible Evidence, now revived at the Royal
National Theatre, that he moved to more complex relationships.
Looking back, it is clear that was a great deal of anger in the British
theatre before 1956. As early as 1924 Coward was an angry young man writing
about drugs and sex in The Vortex. And anyone who has seen the revival of
his Present Laughter at The Globe will have noticed that it is not entirely
a play about upper-class society. The menage in which Gary Essendine lives
contains a broad social mix.
Rattigan pushed the frontiers much further. In the recently revived The Deep
Blue Sea, practically every social class, including immigrants, has a
look-in. The play is a marvellous plea for tolerance of social and sexual
deviation within a society constricted by the law.
How anyone could have thought that Rattigan was a conventional playwright
merely because he used conventional forms must now defy the imagination.
Apart from everything else, he used the conventional forms so well.
Separate Tables, which is now revived at The Albery, is a slightly less good
play. First performed in 1954, two years after The Deep Blue Sea, it was
initially a winner but may have been the beginning of Rattigan's downfall,
because it was about old England - a mixture of shabby genteel people slowly
fading away in a private hotel near Bournemouth.
The fault lies with the structure. Separate Tables tries to roll two sets of
events into one with a gap of 18 months in between. The first concerns a
disgraced former Labour Party minister (class of 1945) whose ex-wife, a once
and perhaps still beautiful model, arrives in the hotel.
They are at least temporarily re-united by the manageress (Charlotte
Cornwell), who represents all that is tolerant and decent in a strained
environment, and is also the former minister's current mistress.
In the second half, the admirable Ms Cornwell strikes again for the forces
of liberalism. She allows another disgraced guest to stay despite the fact
that he has been exposed, and reported in the local newspaper, for minor
indecency in a nearby cinema. The mildly jarring asymmetry is that here, the
manageress has had no direct involvement in the emotions. She is more the
wise ruler than the partial victim.
Yet if you want a liberal Ms Britannia trying to hold a declining country
together in Bournemouth in 1954, look no further. The appropriate patriotic
music quietly pervades the play. Ms Cornwell even has a line that seems a
refinement of Mona Lott in ITMA: 'It's surprising how cheerful one can be
when one gives up hope.'
Some of the period details are wonderfully done. In the early 1950s,
educated Conservative voters read the New Statesman (here called New
Outlook, for which the disgraced politician writes under the pen-name of
Cato), claiming that they did so only for the music criticism.
In Separate Tables, they have views on taxes and dividends that relate to
real life, and (picked up from a television programme) on the respective
merits of levelling up and levelling down. The biggest shock, and it is
considerable, is when the seemingly progressive wife of the young medical
student, turns out not to be a liberal.
There is a lovely twist at the end, when a new couple appears at a table,
talking only to each other, unaware of what has gone before and the drama
that is going on around them. Perhaps here was the beginning of Act 3 or
another play. I like to think of it as a defiant Rattigan gesture: a hint of
what might have been said next, had he not been so rudely interrupted by a
change in fashion.
As it is, there is an ironic shaft at the coming shift in conventions. The
former minister is reprimanded for using the French windows which are
concealed from view. As for social class, he was originally a docker from
Hull.
One more point: there is a direct and telling reference to McCarthyism.
No-one should ever have said that Rattigan was out of touch with his time.
The setting - by which one really means the seating - in Separate Tables is
crucial. In Sir Peter Hall's production, designed by Carl Toms, it is a
trifle ponderous, but that may have been the flavour of the period.
As a theatrical device, the separate, sometimes communicating tables are a
delight. The menu is a mixture of listening, watching, talking and
occasionally eating. Peter Bowles and Patricia Hodge double as the main
romantic parts in both sections.

Summer is upon us and there is a huge number of repeats. Watch the Lausanne
Grand Prix meeting in Athletics (8.00 BBC1, then 9.00 BBC2) and you will be
able to decide where the most amazingly brief clothing is worn on TV these
days: the dance floor in 'Come Dancing' or the athletics track. Stars such
as Heike Drechsler and Linford Christie are expected to compete.
BBC2 repeats a good documentary about Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of
propaganda, called We Have Ways Of Making You Think (8.10). This programme
reveals that Goebbels' own tastes were for Hollywood schlock and that he
arranged for the making of very conventional entertainment movies to keep
the people happy.
In Discovering Beethoven (9.30 BBC2) Michael Tilson Thomas conducts the LSO
at a concert-lecture in which he explains why Beethoven's 5th symphony was a
turning point in music and influenced nearly every other symphony composed
during the following 100 years. The programme ends with a full performance
of the symphony. Channel 4 completes its thriller An Exchange Of Fire
(10.00).

FT  07 JUL 93 / Arts: The Man Who Strides the Wind - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before his death in 1989 Bruce Chatwin had conceived the scheme of an opera,
a collaboration with the composer Kevin Volans. The project was to draw on
ideas from Chatwin's wonderful novel The Songlines, extending its
meditations on the nomadic nature of man, and the focus was to be the life
of Arthur Rimbaud, particularly the years he spent wandering around Africa,
having abandoned his poetic career. Chatwin became too ill to complete any
of the libretto, and the text for The Man Who Strides the Wind, which
received its first performance at the Almeida last weekend, has been
assembled by the writer Roger Clarke from sources that include Rimbaud's own
poetry, Chatwin's travel notebooks and the classical texts - Hesiod, the
Bible - closest to Chatwin's heart.
Of the rash of operas that have been promised in recent years, this
work-in-progress was perhaps the most intriguing and tantalising. Volans'
instrumental and orchestral works have established him as one of the most
distinctive voices in contemporary music, and the subject matter seemed
perfectly suited to a composer who had derived so much flavour from his
South African background. What has reached the stage, though, is a profound
disappointment in musical and dramatic terms.
The reasons for that failure are tangled and hard to establish: the
negligible production by Peter Mumford (designs by Neil Irish) is certainly
no help, and often clumsy in its effects, while Volans' score is realised
tentatively under David Parry's direction. But both producer and conductor
can claim some mitigation; there is something intrinsically unoperatic about
a work whose first act revolves about a death-bed scene, the second is a
sustained duet for tenor and baritone, and only a small fraction of the text
is comprehensible.
The weight of the intellectual argument in The Man Who Strides the Wind
falls in that long (70-minute) second act, as Rimbaud and his
servant/companion Djami wander through the Abyssinian desert while the
former poet tries to come to terms with his restlessness, his inability to
feel at home in any landscape. The first act sets up the discourse as the
dying Rimbaud, returned home after 12 years' wandering, is tended by his
sister and fearsome mother who know nothing of his former life. But the lack
of drama and the lapidary text resist easy involvement; the opera always
manages to hold its audience at arm's length.
Most disappointing of all was the effect of the music itself. The vocal
score promised a wonderfully subtle, teeming texture, full of the teasing
polyrhythms and glistening, slender textures which Volans has made his own.
In the claustrophobic Almeida acoustic, though, many of those effects were
made to seem miscalculated and the instrumental playing (the combined forces
of the Brindisi Quartet and the Almeida Ensemble, fine players all of them)
lacked the precision and delicacy Volans' music always demands. Moments one
looked forward to were totally lost - the very opening of the work, for
instance, with a boy treble intoning fragments of Riombaud's verse as a
backdrop to the utterance of the dying poet, emerged totally indistinct.
While Volans' score contains much that might thrive in a different context,
this is not a show from which the ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio can take
any credit. Only the singers could be satisfied with their contributions:
Thomas Randle made a fine, compelling Rimbaud, Meurig Davies a
compassionate, boyish Djami; Susan Bisatt was the attentive sister Isabelle,
Jennifer Rhys-Davies, the gorgon-like mother. David Newman provided the
shimmer of treble in act one.

Last Saturday, the London City Ballet pirouetted its last at the Theatre
Royal Bath, victim of Arts Council intransigence over regular funding,
Antony Thorncroft writes.
Early in September in Stevenage, the London City Ballet will embark on its
annual autumn tour. That at least was the guarded assurance provided by
artistic director Harold King on Monday. He could sound optimistic because
he was standing next to the money man from ADT, whose chairman Michael
Ashcroft seems set to take over from John Hughes as the financial backer of
the LCB.
He has pledged Pounds 150,000 a year. The plight of the company precipitated
a sudden donation from the widow of Nureyev's agent Sandor Gorlinsky. Texaco
has promised Pounds 150,000 in the autumn. The dancers are now on holiday -
unpaid - but a slightly smaller company should assemble in August to
rehearse Coppelia.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Managment: The shake-up of Big Blue's army - In what could
be a model for the group, IBM UK is pioneering a new regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques Maisonrouge, president of IBM's operations outside the US in the
1970s, once provoked enthusiastic applause during a conference by misreading
the phrase 'IBM teams' as 'IBM troops'.
His slip accurately conveyed the flavour of the traditional IBM marketing
machine; a well-drilled army of blue-suited, white-shirted technocrats
rigidly controlled from the centre with power in the hands of a tiny elite.
Then IBM was the largest and most successful computer manufacturer in the
world; today, hampered by an overweight bureaucracy which has dragged the
company into two years of losses as new technology forces down hardware
prices, 'Big Blue' is seeking new ways to restore vigour and agility. Its
command structure is being dismembered, its foot soldiers 'empowered' to
decide which wars to fight and which weapons to use.
The battleground for some of the most important of these changes is IBM UK.
There are two main reasons. First, recession struck the UK earlier than
other European countries and the UK company has been particularly hard hit
over the past two years; in 1992 it lost Pounds 616m on sales of Pounds
3.75m. Second, competition in the UK computer market is the world's
fiercest. If a solution works in the UK, the argument goes, there is a good
chance it can be exported elsewhere.
The latest move, announced last week, is the division of the UK home sales
operation into a federation of some 30 separate businesses, each with the
power to fix its prices and settle its costs. It is a microcosm of the
grander plan, devised by IBM's former chief executive John Akers, to split
IBM globally into a loose network of separate business units.
There will be three kinds of businesses in the UK: vertical industries such
as banking or retailing; product sectors including enterprise (mainframe)
systems or personal systems; and the computing services businesses,
management consultancy and hardware maintenance. Some will employ only 50
people, others 500 or more.
What practical difference will the new structure make? In the past, business
managers were responsible for their revenues and their share of corporate
costs. If a customer was unhappy with a product or service, the manager had
to go elsewhere in the company to find a solution. There were endless
arguments as salesmen fought their customers' corner against the
bureaucracy.
In the new regime, business managers alone will be responsible for their
profits, costs and their customers' satisfaction. They will be measured by
five criteria: customer satisfaction, employee morale (both measured by
opinion surveys) profits, market share and cash generation.
The vertical industry businesses can buy hardware and software from the IBM
product businesses or from elsewhere if they believe a competitor's
equipment can do the job better.
There will be no monthly reviews. The centre will operate little, if any,
control unless a business starts to go off the rails. According to IBM: 'The
creation of a business federation will give more ownership and
accountability to business managers, enabling the company to return to
profit more quickly.'
It will allow a variety of market approaches each with its own cost
structure. A mainframe sale to the banking sector could be made, for
example, by the banking business unit, by the enterprise systems business
unit or by a specialised sales team within enterprise systems.
The move, codenamed Galaxy, is the latest phase of the so-called Temple
Plan, a blueprint for recovery announced in the middle of 1991 by Nick
Temple, chief executive of IBM UK.
The first phases of the plan have been implemented over the past two years.
The structure of the company has been changed radically. Eight layers of
management have been stripped down to four. A series of early retirement and
voluntary redundancy programmes will have reduced staff numbers from 18,600
in 1985 to just over 11,000 by the end of the summer. Some 80 per cent of
the workforce now come face to face with customers, compared with only 45
per cent two years ago.
Galaxy, however, which will put astonishing power and authority in the hands
of managers more used to taking orders than giving them, will give the
Temple Plan its stiffest test.
It will give business managers control over, first, prices. Javaid Aziz, IBM
UK's general manager, marketing, explains: 'When 10 years ago you sold a
mainframe computer to a banker, an insurer or a retailer, it took the same
amount of resource to make the sale, to install the machine and get it
working. You could list your prices.
'Now the environment has changed. The hardware is secondary to the
requirement that the overall system does the job properly and the people on
the ground understand best how to pull together and price the necessary
hardware, software and services. If you try to price deals like that
centrally, you will have a disaster because the people there do not have
sufficient judgment of the market to be able to price accurately'.
Second, business managers will have control over their costs. Aziz says:
'You cannot have a truly customer-responsive organisation where the cost
structure is determined centrally. If you want your business managers to own
their place in the market, to own their resources and deliver you a profit,
you have to move cost control from the centre to the businesses.
'In March this year only 20 per cent of costs were determined by our
business managers. We intend to move to a situation where they determine 95
per cent of their costs. In this way, you get rid of the final vestiges of a
command and control structure and culture.' Because only 5 per cent of costs
will be determined centrally, there is no need for a large central
bureaucracy. The 2,500 headquarters' staff employed two years ago are being
cut to 100 people who will manage the central holding company.
Headquarters departments such as finance, personnel, distribution and
corporate affairs are being spun out as service units. The businesses are
empowered to buy their services if they wish but are not required to do so;
they could, for example, buy a pension plan from an outside supplier.
Service units which fail to attract adequate business, however, will have no
reason to exist.
Plans like Galaxy are fine in theory but the significant change, as Aziz
accepts, will have to be in Big Blue's corporate mind. It remains to be seen
if the leopard can change its spots.
The plan, needless to say, has the approval of IBM's new chairman and chief
executive, Louis Gerstner. Temple and Aziz presented the details to him
during his visit to the UK in April. He will undoubtedly be watching the UK
experiment with keen interest. He is still enjoying his 'honeymoon' as chief
executive, but analysts are already beginning to ask when he will be ready
to present his recovery plan for the company as a whole.
Aziz claims that the UK company has already gained several points in market
share in mainframes and that business expenses fell 50 per cent between 1991
and 1993 - roughly in line with a decline in staff from 10,500 to 6,500 over
the same period.
This year he hopes to keep revenues in line with last year, despite the
declining cost of hardware. He also hopes to return to profit: 'You have to
get the management systems right, the business measurements right and there
has to be trust and teamwork. These are the pillars on which you build
changes like these,' he says.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Poised for the big leap
forward - The campaign for 'green labels' on wood products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confusion over the environmental acceptability of timber and wood products
could soon be resolved as producers and consumers near an agreement on the
need for a system to label wood from countries which take their ecological
responsibilities seriously.
The evidence of the last two months promises a remarkable advance on the
weak code of practice for the conservation, management and use of forests,
produced at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The International Tropical Timber Organisation - which has representatives
from producer and consumer nations, as well as the timber trade - agreed at
its annual meeting in Malaysia in May to research the possibilities of using
labels to control the trade.
'I'm amazed that this is happening,' says Francis Sullivan, forest
conservation officer of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the UK.
'People have gone from arguing about whether labelling should happen to how
it should be organised.'
The complex politics of the timber trade thwarted United Nations attempts at
the Rio summit to create a treaty on how forests should be managed.
Timber importers are caught in the middle of a passionate debate between the
consumer nations, especially the US and EC states, and the producer nations,
mainly in the tropics.
The developed nations want developing countries, such as Malaysia and
Brazil, to stop wholesale logging. They argue that the world needs the
forests to help in climate control, provide habitats for indigenous people
and maintain plant and animal diversity.
Groups such as Friends of the Earth are threatening producer countries with
trade boycotts unless they conform to management principles which will lead
to the preservation of natural forests. The Netherlands is the first EC
state to embody these sentiments in national policy.
Developing nations, however, are angry at what they see as an intrusion into
their sovereignty and right to exploit natural resources. Malaysia, using
exports of its vast timber resources to build its economy, is the most
eloquent and uncompromising voice in defence of producer nations.
It asks why it should not be able to exploit its forests when western
countries have all but destroyed their natural timber resources and are
doing little to curb industrial pollution.
The arguments are blurred by complexities such as the rights of indigenous
forest peoples and accusations of human rights transgressions in Malaysia,
Indonesia and Brazil.
But the reality for timber importers is that their market in the west is
under increasing pressure to get its products from sustainable sources.
Conservation groups have called for a boycott of timber from unsustainable
sources, mainly the tropics. Governments, notably in Germany and the
Netherlands, have begun to specify alternatives to tropical hardwoods in
building contracts.
B&amp;Q, the UK's biggest DIY retailer, says that by 1995 it will only sell
timber and wood from sustainable sources. Some countries and organisations
are in the process of developing labelling systems so consumers can identify
ecologically sound timber.
The US-based Rainforest Alliance has developed the Smart Wood programme
which grants a label to those producers that it has checked. Projekt
Tropenwald is a voluntary initiative to provide information and
certification of tropical timber sold in Germany.
The Forest Stewardship Council, a predominantly WWF initiative backed by
businesses such as B&amp;Q, wants to become an international council which will
accredit companies that issue certificates to the timber trade.
The African Timber Organisation, representing African producers, plans to
start a labelling scheme to certify the origins of its products.
While there appears to be plenty of agreement on the need for a single,
universally recognised label, there is much disagreement about how to set up
and police such a scheme.
A big problem is for all sides to agree on a definition of sustainable
forest management, including such issues as selective logging, maintenance
of habitat, replanting and sharply reducing road building.
Sceptics say it is impossible to manage natural forests in this way and all
logging should stop. This is clearly not an option for many developing
countries with few natural resources.
But even if an acceptable definition of sustainable management can be
agreed, verifying the source of timber and policing the verifiers poses
immense problems.
Verifiers will have to trace timber as it travels across continents.
Developing nations do not like the idea of a western-based timber
surveillance force operating on their soil.
Nevertheless, many optimists, not least the existing international
verifiers, such as Societe Generale de Surveillance, think a workable
labelling system can be set up. How fast it can be developed, however,
depends on how well producer and consumer nations co-operate. 'Ironically,
setting up a labelling scheme is not the difficult part,' says Jean-Pierre
Kiekens, a lecturer in development economics at the University of Brussels
and a consultant on timber policy.
'The real problem is to bring tropical forests under proper management,
which is a prerequisite to making sustainably produced timber available in
big enough quantities.'

Battles between remote Russia and international investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the Soviet years, Russia's vast and beautiful environment scarcely
rated a mention on the political agenda. But today's investors in Russia
ignore 'green politicians' at their peril.
Some of the Russian environmental movement's most telling successes are at
the level of regional government, in local soviets or parliaments. Primorsky
Krai, a region facing the Sea of Japan, contains dense forests, rivers
teeming with salmon and endangered species including tigers and bears.
In common with many regional bodies, the soviet of Primorsky Krai has a
powerful environmental committee, which regularly fines local polluters. At
the height of communist power, local politicians toed the party line, often
dictated from as far away as Moscow. These days they are more independently
minded: 'Essentially, I am against the industrialist, technical mentality
which prevails everywhere,' says Anatoly Lebedev, deputy chairman of the
environmental committee.
Lebedev's constituency is Krasny Yar, a town little larger than a village.
Most of his constituents hunt and fish for a living in the surrounding
forests of the Pozharsky District.
Despite the remoteness of the region and his small constituency, Lebedev has
found himself at the centre of an environmental battle of international
dimensions. The moral of the tale is that investors should pay attention to
Russian politics on a very local level indeed.
In 1990, the Hyundai Group of South Korea formed a joint venture - Svetlaya
 -with two local logging companies. Svetlaya spent Dollars 70m (Pounds
46.6m) building a sea port, roads and a technical base around the coastal
town of Svetlaya, outside Lebedev's constituency.
But two-thirds of the 1m cu m of timber, which Svetlaya planned to cut
annually, were located across the political boundary in Pozharsky District,
Lebedev's political power base.
The joint venture had the public backing of the then governor of Primorsky
Krai, Vladimir Kuznetsov. The Russian government has long recognised the
strategic importance of Hyundai Group to the Russian economy. But in
Russia's state of constitutional confusion, it is no longer always enough
just to have friends in high places.
'Under Russian land use legislation, the real provider of natural resources
is the district soviet,' says Lebedev. In this case, that meant the soviet
of Pozharsky, a sub district of Primorsky.
'The Pozharsky soviet categorically refused to let us log on their land,'
says Vladimir Stegny, president of the Svetlaya joint venture.
Local people feared that logging on the hills around the source of the
Biikin River would damage the salmon-breeding waters which provide their
livelihood.
Lebedev's objections go further: 'This is one of the last pristine forests
left in the world. Their plan to 'clear-cut' (whole sections of) the forest
on steep slopes will create a desert.'
Nor is Lebedev impressed by the joint venture's plans to replant 3m trees a
year. 'They have some beautiful greenhouses, but there is no point in
planting young trees in a desert. They will die.'
The point was underlined by Greenpeace, which last October blockaded the
Svetlaya harbour, temporarily bringing exports to a halt. The confusion
surrounding the Svetlaya case has done little for the region's image abroad.
'Korean and Japanese businessmen often call me to ask about the latest
situation,' says Stegny.
Svetlaya challenged Pozharsky Soviet in court last June.
The regional court decided in Svetlaya's favour, but Pozharsky Soviet's
appeal to the Supreme Court of Russia showed the weakness of Russia's legal
system. The appeal judges failed to draw any firm conclusion, merely ruling
that there were 'deficiencies' in the earlier judgment. The legal position
is still up in the air.
'I believe that local people need us as much as we need them. They will come
round in a couple of years' time,' says Stegny. But he tacitly admits the
environmentalists had a point.
Svetlaya now selectively cuts trees. Its Dollars 70m investment assumed the
joint venture would be in profit by its fourth year. But reduced logging
means that break-even point is seven to 10 years away.
Elsewhere in Russia, environmental demands are important criteria when it
comes to issuing rights to develop natural resources. In general, this is
good news for foreign investors. Russian competitors often have a poor
environmental record.
One of the largest deals under negotiation is a project to develop gas
fields on the continental shelf off the island of Sakhalin. A consortium
known as MMMMS, including Marathon and McDermott from the US, Japan's Mitsui
and Mitsubishi, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell, hopes to conclude the Dollars
10bn deal soon.
'This is one of the most difficult projects in Russia, from an environmental
point of view,' says Galina Pavlova, a local Peoples Deputy and member of
the Sakhalin Soviet Ecology Committee.
'Environmental concerns have added considerably to the cost. But as an
ecologist, I am happy with the proposals, provided they do everything we
want.'
On the volcanic peninsula of Kamchatka, one of the poorest and least
developed regions of Russia, the local administration plans an international
tender for extraction of 90 tons of gold from the south of the peninsula. As
soon as the plan was announced, the governor of Kamchatka, Vladimir
Biryukov, went on television to say that the project would go to the most
environmentally clean proposal.
In Primorsky Krai, the environmentalists are girding their loins for the
next battle. The Ministry of Atomic Energy is funding a feasibility study
into building underground nuclear power stations in the far east of Russia.
In the late 1980s, Lebedev fended off a similar plan to build a nuclear
reactor near Krasny Yar. He does not think it will be an easy fight this
time round.
'The nuclear mafia in this country still have a great deal of resources and
influence,' he says.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Management: A Catholic view of business ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aristocracy of the pre-capitalist era had well-defined ideals, which
provided the basis for codes of ethics that guided their behaviour. But
modern businesspeople still lack ideals, a good 200 years after the birth of
capitalism.
That is the view of Michael Novak, the US neo-conservative Catholic
philosopher. In last month's Hayek memorial lecture, hosted by the Institute
of Economic Affairs, the London free-market think tank, he set out to remedy
this deficiency.
According to Novak, much of what goes by the name of business ethics is
abstract and uninspiring because it does not address the ideals and
principles that relate specifically to business as a form of human activity.
What he calls 'kitchen-variety' moral standards, such as honesty, fairness
and sensitivity - which apply to other walks of human life as much as to
business - command most of the attention.
One consequence is a lack of confidence among businesspeople when it comes
to singing the praises of their way of life. 'We tend to think that business
lacks ideals, is merely utilitarian, concerned mainly with vulgar profit and
ranks considerably below a humanistic or Christian vocation. Businessmen do
not have the language to talk about the ideals of business.'
Novak aims to fill this gap by identifying not so much a code of business
ethics as an ethic for business. 'What way of life do I wish to choose for
myself, as I commit the larger part of my waking hours to this specific
practical vocation? What are the ideals inherent in this vocation?'
His answer is that the business vocation has two ideals: creativity and
community. For Novak, businesspeople are motivated not merely by a desire to
make profits but by the 'romance and risk of enterprise'. He says: 'Most
academic writers seem never to have imagined the sheer fun and creative
pleasure involved in bringing a new business to birth. Such creativity has
the stamp of a distinctive personality all over it.'
He argues that business creativity is the fundamental source of wealth
creation. This, he says, explains why nations as rich in natural resources
such as Brazil remain poor, while others with almost no natural resources -
such as Japan - become among the richest in the world.
Novak's second ideal for business - community - seems on the surface rather
odd, given the widespread perception that capitalism rests on individualism.
But Novak rejects this: 'Capitalism is not about individualism. It is about
a creative form of community.'
The form of community particular to capitalism is the private business
corporation, which Novak argues is capitalism's main institutional
contribution to the human race. It is a community, one of whose main social
purposes is to 'make a profit, that is, to create new wealth beyond the
wealth that existed before it came into being'.
Novak dubs his approach to business 'the Catholic ethic and the spirit of
capitalism', contrasting the approach taken by Max Weber in his book, The
Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Where Weber saw the roots of
capitalism in the Protestants' self-denial, asceticism and sense of the
depravity of natural man, Novak stresses 'invention, serendipity, surprise
and the sort of romance that leads many to risk their shirts'. These, he
says, are characteristic of the Catholic approach to creation.
Novak's ideal of creative community addresses essential aspects of human
psychology left out by the crude picture of economic man as concerned about
nothing more than how to maximise profits.
The argument's main weakness is that it slides over the real difficulties in
marrying creativity and community, which often pull in opposite directions.
Many creative individuals give little attention to their communities, while
many communities - such as the large institutional bureaucracies of the
modern world - stifle creativity.
Novak says that a free society must 'examine all its institutions to see
whether they are promoting or repressing human creativity'. Perhaps one
should not expect more practical answers from a philosopher. Finding them is
the challenge of today's businesspeople.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Jobs: Immeasurable waste of human talent - How selecting
people by paper qualifications can exclude those best fitted for the work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECRUITERS the world over should occasionally raise their glass to the
memory of Heinrich Weber, saying 'there but for the grace of God . . .'
While Weber never made much of a name in his chosen field of science, he is
notable for a historic achievement. As head of the physics department at the
Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule at Zurich in 1900, he took the lead in
ensuring that of all his departing students who aspired to a full-time
academic appointment, only one had his every application rejected.
That student was called Albert Einstein.
What distinguishes Weber from today's recruiters, of course, is not that he
turned down an extremely able candidate. The present lot probably do
likewise time and again. The difference is just that, in their case, the
world rarely if ever comes to hear of it. And one of the reasons is that
young people aren't even allowed to start in most types of well regarded
work unless they have a certificate testifying to success in academic
examinations.
More and more the minimum stipulation for entry is that they must be
graduates, which remains the case regardless of wholesale graduate
unemployment. While the possession of a degree might not be enough to win
desirable jobs on offer, anybody who lacked one would simply never be
considered.
Accordingly, most large employers nowadays would themselves turn down the
21-year-old Einstein. Quite apart from the fact that he studied at a
technical college as opposed to a pukka university, what he emerged with was
not a degree, but a non-graduate teacher's qualification.
The explanation for such daftness no doubt partly lies in the typically
defensive attitude of company recruiters, which is probably the result of
personnel managers' rarely having much political clout in their outfit.
Although they draw up the short-lists of candidates, which one to appoint is
usually decided by the boss the person will directly work for. Hence when
recruits turn out well, the deciding bosses are apt to claim the credit.
Alas they don't seem nearly as keen to take the blame when appointments go
wrong. Instead, it gets saddled on the recruitment staff, who could well end
up in the dole queue unless they have a good excuse handy. Being aware that
every appointment is a risk, and knowing there are few better excuses than
being able to point to a failed recruit's impressive paper qualifications,
they tend to exclude from their shortlists any contender without
conventionally approved certificates.
But, to the Job's column's mind, a deeper reason for the daftness is
widespread blindness, and seemingly not solely in Britain, to the
distinction I wrote about two weeks ago. It is the distinction between the
sort of knowledge required for success in academic exams on the one hand,
and the type needed to do skilled work on the other.
As some of you present today may have been missing from the congregation a
fortnight back, I had better once again summarise the difference between the
two varieties of knowledge.
The exam-passing sort consists of two main elements. The first is
factual-type knowledge: knowing that something is so. The other is
scientific-style explanations of certain phenomena: knowing why they are so.
Both of them might be lumped together as knowing about the topic in
question.
The ability to do skilled work, however, depends decisively on knowing how -
which I contend is not the same thing at all.
True, not everybody agrees with me, as protests from a dozen or so readers
show. Although only one goes as far as to call the distinction 'casuistic
nonsense', most of them think that it does not apply to the type of skilled
work which they consider most important to humanity: the type centrally
dependent on the use of the mind.
In their view, such work is done by a two-stage process. First know-thats
and know-whys of the sort developed by exam-focused education are used to
think out what needs to be done, drawing up a step-by-step intellectual plan
of the action needed. Stage two is to carry out the plan in practice.
Well, up to a point. I wouldn't deny that some forms of mentally centred
work can be done in that way. No doubt they include aspects of the
occupations with which some of the protesters identify themselves: the law,
financial management, and in one instance corporate strategy.
But I feel sure that the same clearly does not apply in the case of most
kinds of such work, and especially not those requiring innovative talents.
Moreover, besides being untrue of the bulk of skilled jobs in industry and
commerce, it does not apply to top-rank academic research work.
As evidence, I would cite the responses of some hundreds of expert people I
have questioned over the years on how they do their job. As well as assorted
managers and specialist staff in business, they include academic researchers
ranging across varied sciences, engineering, economics, psychology and - yea
 -even unto philosophy.
With no more than a handful of exceptions, they denied they worked by first
intellectually planning what they were going to do, and then acting in line
with the mental blue-print. Their actual ways of operating were far less
clear-cut.
Their typical first explanation was simply: 'I do it by feel'. Even after
reflecting, most could say nothing clearer than that the thinking involved
in their job is somehow embedded in the doing, and cannot be separated from
it.
Far from being classifiable neatly into know-thats and know-whys, their
skill depended on knowing something-else-besides, an intuitive faculty they
could often express only by invoking the senses - an 'eye' for this, a
'nose' for that . . . a feel.
What is abundantly clear, however, is that know-how differs from know-about.
And oddly enough, recalling the example of Einstein, the contrast was best
depicted by a physicist, John Adkins of Cambridge University.
Just as the bachelor-level degrees based on know-that and know-why are no
longer enough to win a desirable job, he thinks, they aren't a sufficient
grounding for academic research work in the subject concerned. Even of the
people so good at learning about physics as to gain first-class honours, for
instance, only a minority go on to do physics with any significant result.
By the reverse token, does he think there could be people with the talent to
do physics, but short on ability to learn about it?
'I'd certainly say so. The things that are needed to get a good degree are
not the same things that are needed for success in research. A good memory
is less important, for example, whereas the patience to perform repetitive
tasks with vigilance and fine accuracy is much more so. First-class honours
graduates often find them too boring to bear, but they are essential to
preparing the mind for research.'
There seems no reason, he adds, why people should be unable to become
physicists by starting with an apprenticeship in such routine procedures,
and acquiring the necessary know-about as they go along. The only trouble,
of course, is that such talents will never have the chance to be developed
as long as educational conventions insist that exam-passing, no matter how
inessential, must come first.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers determined to derail BR
rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister yesterday said it was 'probable' that the government
would try to reverse its humiliating defeat earlier this week on a central
element of the plans to privatise British Rail.
Ministers appear set on a collision course with potential Tory rebels as
they looked increasingly determined to overturn the embarrassing setback on
Monday, when the Lords voted to allow BR to bid for rail franchises after
privatisation.
In the Commons, Labour exploited the government's discomfiture, as Mrs
Margaret Beckett, the opposition deputy leader, urged minsters: 'Why doesn't
the government show some common sense for once and just admit they have got
it wrong?'
While Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, sought to steer a course
between dismissing the Lords' arguments and indicating that he would look
again at the question, ministers are privately forthright in opposing the
move.
But the Tory MPs who previously threatened revolt to win concessions from
the government on issues such as railcards have taken heart from the Lords'
decision. Mr Tim Rathbone (Lewes), a leading Tory campaigner, suggested the
proposal would now command more support than the similar bid to change the
bill when MPs last discussed it.
'An amendment that has been proposed by a very distinguished previous Tory
Transport Minister, and carried with the support of Conservative members of
the House of Lords, bears rather more careful consideration by Conservative
MPs than something that is put forward by the Labour party,' he said.
The bill returns to the Commons in the autumn, and ministers are
demonstrating their confidence by not rushing into negotiations with earlier
rebels such as Sir Keith Speed and Sir John Stanley.
A further sign of confidence was the Department of Transport's coolness on
one possible area of compromise mentioned by Lord Caithness, a government
spokesman in the Lords.
He said it would be permissible for BR to be a junior partner in a private
consortium bidding for passenger franchises. Officials said yesterday that
though allowable, it was not the government's intention that BR should be
involved in this way. Ministers argue such a move would run counter to the
logic of the measure which envisages teams of former BR employees
effectively privatising BR routes by bidding for individual franchises.
They also point out BR will be involved in every bidding process anyway,
since each route will be kept in BR's hands if the private bidders fail to
offer the government a better deal.
The government is today expected to set July 29 as the date for the
Christchurch by-election, ending speculation they could seek to delay the
poll until September.
The focus of the contest - caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley, the noted
Tory rail rebel - will be Mr Robert Hayward's efforts to defend a majority
of 23,000 against a strong Liberal Democrat challenge.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: The same people will do the same
jobs - Potential effects of the Lords rebellion on the BR sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL may not have an unblemished reputation as a railway operator,
but it knows more about running trains than any other organisation in the
country. Would it not be odd then to prevent it from bidding for franchises
after privatisation?
This straightforward argument lies behind Monday night's parliamentary
rebellion in which Conservative peers joined opposition parties to subvert a
central tenet of the government's privatisation plans.
The Department of Transport's position since rail privatisation was mooted a
year ago has been that allowing BR to compete for franchises would undermine
the point of privatisation - to move the operation of passenger services
into the private sector.
Barely six weeks ago Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, fought off a
backbench rebellion on the issue as the Railways Bill passed through the
Commons. But now an embarrassing defeat in the Lords has resulted in the
addition of a clause to the bill that would allow BR to become a franchisee.
The amendment was proposed by Lord Peyton of Yeovil, a former Conservative
transport minister, who argued that it would provide a better measure of
continuity during the privatisation process than the government had
proposed.
Peers were left in little doubt about the government's strength of feeling
about the proposal when Lord Caithness, the government's transport spokesman
in the Lords, argued that it would 'undermine the whole franchising
process'.
The government's fear is that if BR were allowed to join in the bidding, the
franchises might never pass into the private sector - for at least five
reasons:
BR's inside knowledge of the financial performance and potential of its
passenger services would give it an unfair advantage over the private sector
in pitching its bid.
As a government-owned body, BR would have access to capital at much lower
rates of interest than the private sector and would not need to generate
such high rates of return.
BR's breadth of operations would enable it to submit artificially low bids
for routes by cross-subsidising them with revenues from other services.
BR could always undercut private-sector rivals on price in the knowledge
that, if the numbers failed to add up at the end of the year, it could go to
the government and ask for a bigger subsidy.
The management/employee buy-out teams now considering bids would be severely
constrained from pressing ahead by the notion of competing with their
employers.
Some support for these reasons comes from Sweden where the government has
also started to open its railway services to private-sector competition but
allows Swedish State Railways to join in the bidding.
The process is still at an early stage and only regional and local services
have been opened to competition, but experience so far has shown that nearly
every passenger service has gone to the state railway company because the
private sector cannot beat it on price.
In Britain the government's view is that the debate over BR's participation
in the privatisation process is unnecessary because it is based on a false
premise: that BR's knowledge and expertise would be lost if it ceased to
become a train operator.
In fact, surprisingly little may change when private-sector franchisees take
over services. Most of the same people will carry on doing most of the same
jobs. It will be rather like a corporate takeover, where new management
takes over at the top but most of the rest of the workforce stays the same.
One company interested in taking over some services - Badger Rail, a
division of the bus operator Badgerline - says: 'What we can bring along is
organisational skills, marketing skills, and some private enterprise flair
to it all, so we end up working in conjunction with BR's in-house expertise
to make a better job of the whole thing.'
Mr Philip Snowden, Badger Rail's managing director, did not attempt to
disguise his concern over the latest turn of events in parliament:
'Certainly we would have to consider very carefully whether we were still
interested in passenger service franchising if BR as an organisation were
allowed to bid.'
Other would-be franchisees felt confident the government would have the
offending clause removed from the bill when it returns to the Commons after
the summer break.
Also, as one optimistically observed, it would not be the end of
privatisation if BR were allowed to bid: all the government would need to do
would be to tell the franchising director that BR should never, under any
circumstances, win.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs give warning on housing cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government to maintain the present level of housing
association grants mounted yesterday with the publication of a Commons
environment committee report warning that cuts would put decent housing
beyond the reach of many families.
The report, which says that ministers must consider the wider social
consequences of short-term budget savings, was welcomed by Sir George Young,
the housing minister.
Sir George faces a fight to protect housing association budgets in the
forthcoming spending round negotiations with the Treasury, which has
identified housing expenditure as an area for possible savings.
He said he would assess carefully the implications of the committee's report
and expected to publish his response after the summer recess.
The report says that previously published government plans to reduce housing
association grant rates from the current 67 per cent to 55 per cent by
1995-96 would prevent some associations from building homes and leave many
tenants facing higher rents. MPs say the government should therefore drop
the planned cuts.
Ministers are also urged to set up a working party to review the
relationship between housing association grants and housing benefit
entitlements - and to develop a strategy for easing the problems faced by
tenants caught in the poverty trap.
Mr John Battle, Labour's housing spokesman, said housing associations needed
an end to the uncertainty surrounding their future so that they could
attract additional private finance. Tenants needed to know that their rents
were not going to 'rocket' because of grant cuts.
Mr Jim Coulter, director of the National Federation of Housing Associations,
said the report confirmed that the government was stifling the potential
growth of social housing. 'We call on the minister to announce that housing
association grant rates will not be reduced in the coming two years'.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major accepts Pounds 1,001 in libel
case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR said last night that his libel case with New Statesman and
Society magazine had been settled and that he had accepted damages of Pounds
1,001. 'Having regard to substantial damages already received from the
printers and distributors, I am content to accept the additional sum paid
into court by the New Statesman, together with my costs as a settlement to
this action,' Mr Major said in a statement from the G7 meeting in Tokyo.
The statement was issued after the magazine had stated that actions by Mr
Major and caterer Ms Clare Latimer had been settled, each with a payment of
Pounds 1,001.
The action arose out of an article published in the magazine in January
which linked Mr Major to Ms Clare Latimer. Mr Major had demanded substantial
compensation for libel after rejecting as unacceptable a statement of
explanation published in the magazine the following month.
The magazine said it considered the conclusion of the action vindicated its
opinion that the article was not defamatory. It claimed that total costs to
the magazine arising from actions taken over the article now exceeded Pounds
200,000.
A settlement means that the prime minister will not have to appear in court
in support of his action. He would have become the first prime minister to
enter the witness box in a libel case.
Mr Major has already concluded libel actions against the distributor of the
magazine and two wholesalers.
A poll in today's Guardian shows Mr Major to have the lowest-recorded
personal popularity rating for a serving prime minister.
The ICM poll says Mr Major is seen as incompetent with 'no clear idea of
where he is leading the government'. His popularity rating - at just 14 per
cent - is well below Baroness Thatcher's lowest-ever recording in April 1990
when she scored 23 per cent.

MR JOHN PRESCOTT yesterday urged a compromise between the Labour leadership
and the unions to avoid a damaging clash over internal party democracy at
the party's autumn conference, Philip Stephens writes.
But senior Labour officials underlined Mr John Smith's determination not to
retreat from the introduction of the one-member-one-vote principle for the
selection of parliamentary candidates.
Mr Prescott, a member of the shadow cabinet and the party's national
executive, said it was still possible to reconcile Mr Smith's proposals with
the unions' demands for a collective voice in the party's affairs.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU rejects Labour's plan for vote
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAUSE of electoral reform in the Labour party received an unexpected
setback yesterday when the conference of the TGWU general union, the biggest
union affiliated to the party, narrowly rejected a motion calling for
acceptance of the principle.
In spite of support from the union's executive and Mr Bill Morris, the
general secretary, the motion fell by just 19 votes and a motion supporting
the electoral status quo passed with a comfortable majority.
The decision follows a similar rejection of electoral reform at the GMB
general union and may effect the consultation processes which are continuing
in other large unions. The party's Plant Commission has come out in favour
of the principle of reform, but several senior members of the party remain
strongly opposed to changing the first-past-the-post system. Mr John Smith,
the party leader, has, however, said that if Labour wins the next election
he would support a referendum on the issue.
The cause of electoral reform in the TGWU may have been damaged by
association with the current debate on re-shaping the links between the
unions and the party. Unions such as the TGWU are feeling on the defensive
and left and right are finding common cause against the 'modernisers'.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, yesterday urged Mr Smith not to draw back from reforming
links between the party and the unions.
Mr Laird also announced that the AEEU membership had voted to keep the
union's political fund. A 25 per cent turnout of the union's 900,000-members
voted 3-1 in favour of continued financial support - worth about Pounds 1m a
year - for Labour.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government support for councils may
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHIFT in government support for councils away from inner cities towards
rural areas will take place next spring unless ministers act to mitigate its
effect, Alison Smith writes.
The review of the basis on which the government allocates grant, together
with the use of the full information from the 1991 census, suggests that
some urban councils could lose up to 20 per cent of their grant.
Ministers acknowledge that such a change could not be allowed to happen in a
single year. Apart from difficulty for local authorities, the London local
elections in May next year are another reason to soften the impact.
Figures indicate that some London boroughs, including flagship Tory councils
Westminster and Wandsworth, would lose between 10 per cent and 14 per cent
of their standard spending assessments.

A SUBSTANTIAL shift in government support for local councils, away from
inner cities and towards rural areas, will take place next spring, unless
ministers act to mitigate its effect.
The review of the basis on which the government allocates grant, together
with the use of the full information from the 1991 census, suggests that
some urban councils could lose up to 20 per cent of their grant.
Ministers acknowledge that such a stark change could not be allowed to
happen in a single year. Apart from the sheer difficulty for local
authorities of such a large adjustment, the London local elections in May
next year provide a further reason to soften the impact.
Simply updating the formula by which the government decides how much it
thinks councils should spend, recent government figures indicate that some
inner London boroughs, including the flagship Tory councils in Westminster
and Wandsworth, would lose between 10 per cent and 14 per cent of their
standard spending assessments.
On the same basis, more remote - mainly rural - districts could gain by just
over 13 per cent in their SSAs.
The review of SSAs is set to intensify this shift.
Less weight is expected to be given in the system to factors such as
ethnicity. Double-counting is also expected to be cut: at present, for
example, there are separate factors for the number of lone parents in an
area and the number of people on income support, even though the two groups
over-lap.
The Department of the Environment admits that these figures will not be
reflected in the grant settlement for next year.
Instead, ministers are likely to agree on some form of separate grant,
similar to the one operating this year.
That grant compensates councils which lost more than 5 per cent of their
grant because of the fall in population revealed by use of the basic 1991
census data.

FT  07 JUL 93 / People: Russell to chair 3i
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir George Russell, chairman and chief executive of Marley, the building
materials group, is set to emerge as the new chairman of 3i, Britain's
largest venture capital company, at the end of this month.
A formal decision on his appointment has still to be taken but the firm
indications are that Sir George, currently a non-executive director, will
take over the chair vacated so hurriedly in April by Alan Wheatley. A formal
announcement is expected at 3i's annual meeting on July 28.
Wheatley, a former senior partner with accountants Price Waterhouse, stepped
down when 3i's shareholders, the banks, decided to postpone indefinitely a
decision on a public listing for the company.
Sir George, who is 57, is no stranger to controversy. He is chairman of the
Independent Television Commission, which is opposing plans by the
independent television companies to reschedule News at Ten to an earlier
evening slot.
A commonsense Geordie who once considered joining Sunderland United, he
joined ICI as a graduate trainee at the start of a long career in the
chemicals and aluminium industries. His television connection started in the
late 1980s when he became deputy chairman of Channel Four.
3i has not traditionally been an exciting part of the financial community.
Providing equity and loan finance to small and medium sized companies is a
cautious long term business dependent on a careful assessment of companies
and their managements.
It is only in the past three years that the proposed flotation and a
succession of postponements as the recession deepened have made the job of
chairman a high profile position. Sir John Cuckney joined 3i with the
mission to take it public but retired early in frustration. Alan Wheatley
was in place for only nine months before shareholders decided to wait for a
strong recovery before floating and he left.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Political Notebook: Paying the Tory piper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST HOURS before Mr John Major left this week for the Tokyo summit, his
office quietly released a series of replies to questions from MPs about
Conservative party funding.
The answers, deposited without fanfare in the parliamentary press gallery,
told us two things.
The first was that Mr Asil Nadir had not been a guest at Downing Street
during the period from November 1990 that Mr Major has been prime minister.
But in the preceding five years the fugitive businessmen had crossed the
threshold of No 10 six times, on four occasions to attend charity functions
but on two others as a prime ministerial guest.
Mr Major's second point was that he had not allowed his party to use the
splendour of Downing Street to woo potential contributors to Tory coffers.
The two dozen events during his premiership had all been sponsored by
eminently worthy causes.
That is not to say that individual contributors to party funds are no longer
invited for a handshake at No 10 after depositing their cheques at Central
Office (nor that Mr Major does not dine with overseas benefactors on trips
abroad).
But the donors are vetted more carefully. And the practice under which the
party's treasurers once claimed automatic right of access to the prime
minister's study to impress their most valuable catches has ended.
The intended inference was clear. Mr Major had concluded that it was better
not to mix so blatantly as in the past the business of government and party
politics. Put another way, Tory fundraising in Lady Thatcher's day may have
become a pretty murky affair but her successor had cleaned up the act.
The change, it is said, explains the prime minister's visible fury in recent
weeks when confronted with allegations that this or that crook or this or
that oil sheikh routinely fills his party's coffers. During his time in No
10 Mr Major has been accused of many things, often justly. But even his
enemies are disinclined to believe he is a crook.
He is wrong though if he believes that by quietly dis-avowing the more
dubious practices of the past he will solve the party's problems in the
future.
It is true that, barring fresh revelations, the funding issue appears to
have run out of steam at Westminster. MPs and the journalists who write
about them have short attention spans. The media had discredited its own
case with wild and unsubstantiated allegations even before Mr Michael Mates'
excursion into the world of conspiracy theory took the pack in different
directions.
But it will be impossible to return the genie to the bottle. Senior members
of the government admit quite openly that the Conservatives can no longer
accept with impunity wads of banknotes from Greek shipping magnates and Hong
Kong businessmen. Who pays the piper promises to be a potent Labour slogan
at the next election. The media will no longer be fobbed off with stories
that the bill for the services of Saatchi and Saatchi is being paid out of
the proceeds of coffee mornings in Surrey.
Some ministers believe also it will be difficult if not impossible for the
party to refuse to disclose large corporate donations. At the very least,
central office will have to check that such contributors meet their legal
obligation to declare the payments in published accounts - and return the
money if they do not. The pessimists - and there are some in the cabinet -
add that, whatever Mr Major may say now, the party will be driven eventually
to accepting disclosure of all substantial donations whether from companies
or individuals. All this is grim news for Sir Norman Fowler who is
struggling to pay off an Pounds 18m central office overdraft and find money
to fight the local, the European and eventual general elections.
There is worse. The recent furore has alienated further the Tory grassroots
activists who offer the only realistic source of alternative funding for the
party. The local constituency associations have long taken a dim view of the
way central office spends (they would say squanders) its money. Of the
Pounds 18m they raised last year the associations handed over only Pounds 1m
to Smith Square. Some refuse to contribute anything at all to central funds.
Others are fiercely resisting Sir Norman's attempts to curb their autonomy
through a more structured relationship with the centre.
The anecdotal evidence offered by Tory MPs after recent visits to their
constituencies is that opinion among the activists has now hardened further.
Demoralised anyway by the government's incompetence, many have been appalled
by the idea that dubious 'foreigners' have been financing the spendthrift
habits of the party leadership. Mr Major perhaps should be a little less
dismissive of state funding of political parties. He might need it.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott urges party compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PRESCOTT urged yesterday a compromise between the Labour leadership
and the unions to avoid a damaging clash over internal party democracy at
the party's autumn conference.
But senior Labour officials underlined Mr John Smith's determination not to
retreat from the introduction of the one-member-one-vote principle for the
selection of parliamentary candidates.
Mr Prescott, a member of both the shadow cabinet and the party's National
Executive and an influential voice on the left of the party, said it was
still possible to reconcile Mr Smith's proposals with the unions' demands
for a collective voice in the party's affairs.
Speaking ahead of Mr Smith's speech later today to the TGWU general union,
Mr Prescott said that the unions should retain a significant share of the
votes in the electoral college which chooses the leader of the party. These
could be cast on the basis of a register of political levy-payers and would
recognise the leader's role as that of the entire Labour movement.
But Mr Prescott, who is likely to be a pivotal figure in the backroom
bargaining ahead of the conference, supported Mr Smith's insistence that
only Labour party members should be entitled to vote in the selection of
candidates.
He suggested that an agreement on leadership elections which preserved a
collective, albeit disaggregrated, vote for the unions - an idea on which
the Labour leader has indicated he is open to discussion - could swing a
number of unions behind the introduction of one-member-one-vote for
parliamentary selections.
Mr Smith intends to use his speech to the TGWU today to warn the unions that
he will not retreat from that principle and that he wants a settlement of
the issue at this year's conference

FT  07 JUL 93 / People: Jones follows in Kerss' footsteps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Jones, chief executive of South Wales Electricity, is taking over as
the next chief executive of the National Grid Company. He joins at the end
of the year, with a short handover period between himself and his
predecessor, Bill Kerss, who is stepping down next March when he reaches the
normal retiring age of 63.
An English engineer from the Midlands, Jones, 51, looks back on a 32-year
career in the industry, with two regional electricity boards, South Western
and Midlands. He joined South Wales in 1988 as deputy chairman -
coincidentally exactly the position Kerss had held before moving on to the
National Grid. He was appointed managing director at the time of
privatisation and has run the company, together with chairman Wynford Evans,
since then.
One analyst describes it as an extremely effective partnership, with Evans
dealing with much of the political and Welsh aspects of the com-pany's
affairs, while Jones concentrated on the day-to-day operation.
In April, Jones had assumed the new title of group chief executive, a move
which did not however entail any real change of responsibilities or a change
in salary.
Jones is credited with helping mastermind a comprehensive reorganisation at
South Wales. The presence of Welsh Water, which built a controversial stake
in the company which it then disposed of at the end of last year, helped
spur management on to make a round of cost-cutting more quickly than
happened in some of the other regions.
South Wales says it is embarking on an extensive search for Jones'
replacement. While there are internal candidates, it is also searching
elsewhere within the industry as well as outside the confines of the
electricity business.
The National Grid Holding (NGH) company is owned by the 12 regional
electricity companies and South Wales has a 5.4 per cent stake. Jones has
been on the board of NGH since privatisation; no head- hunters were involved
in his appointment.

FT  07 JUL 93 / People: Woods for Bridport-Gundry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridport-Gundry, the medical, aviation and defence products group that has
just parted company with its group managing director, 50-year-old Brian
Cowley, has recruited Geoffrey Woods as its new chief executive.
Chairman Pat Darley says that Cowley, who had been in the post for just over
four years, went 'as a result of lack of confidence. Clearly things were not
working out', but he was not prepared to elaborate.
The company that once specialised in fishermen's netting has moved into the
fibre technology business, making a range of products from restraint systems
for Deutsche Airbus and the space shuttle to medical sutures.
Woods, 45, who joins next week, had been managing director of Toray Textiles
Europe, a subsidiary of the Japanese company. He had previously
distinguished himself by being one of the youngest managing directors within
Courtaulds, the company he joined as a graduate trainee in 1969. Darley, who
predicts that his arrival at Bridport will not herald a change of strategy,
says he was chosen for his strong marketing skills.

THE GOVERNMENT is today expected to set July 29 as the date for the
Christchurch by-election, ending speculation they could seek to delay the
poll until September.
The main focus of the contest - caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley, the
veteran Tory rail rebel - will be Mr Robert Hayward's efforts to defend a
Conservative majority of 23,000 against a strong Liberal Democrat challenge.
The former Tory MP for Kingswood, who lost his seat in last year's general
election, was selected as the Tory candidate last month.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Proposals on sentence discounting welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'sentence discounting' recommended by the royal commission would extend
and clarify current arrangements to secure a guilty plea before a trial
begins.
At present, a judge can be approached by a defendant's lawyers for an
indication only of whether or not he or she has a custodial sentence in
mind. Judges cannot say how long a prison sentence they may be considering.
Rough tariffs for offences are accepted and the standard discount for an
early plea is a one third reduction in the size of a sentence.
This discount applies for all kinds of criminal offences across the board.
On some occasions - such as when co-operation is provided in investigations
into organised crime - the discounts can be substantially higher.
The sentence discounting proposed by the commission would extend this by
allowing judges to indicate the length of prison sentences they were
considering at that point in the proceedings.
This is welcomed by some lawyers as avoiding problems when judges impose
sentences that differ from those on the normally accepted tariff.
It falls considerably short, however, of the US system of plea-bargaining
where prosecutors are in effect able to offer sentence reductions in return
for co-operation in their inquiries. Lord Runciman yesterday made clear that
the commission rejected this scenario and stuck firmly to the view that
sentencing remained a responsibility of the judiciary, not prosecutors.
The commission proposed safeguards to prevent the innocent feeling under
pressure to plead guilty to offences they have not committed. The
discounting procedure would be instigated by the defendant only. The meeting
with the judge would be heard in camera and formally noted to avoid later
confusion.
The commission's proposals have been welcomed by some lawyers as an
improvement on present arrangements. Others are less convinced. Mr Michael
Mansfield QC is among those who argue it is likely to lead to more wrongful
convictions as pressure is inevitably applied on the innocent to plead
guilty.

FT  07 JUL 93 / House prices 'decline 1.1%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES fell by 1.1 per cent in June, Halifax, the country's biggest
building society, said yesterday. The society said it was the second monthly
fall in succession.
The findings conflict with figures published by Nationwide, the second
largest society, which reported that prices rose 1.6 per cent in June, the
fourth consecutive monthly price rise recorded by the society.
Halifax, unlike Nationwide, adjusts its figures to take account of seasonal
variations. It said that if figures from both societies were 'averaged out',
they would show very little movement since last September: 'House prices are
unlikely to show consistent rises until there is firmer evidence of rising
demand for mortgage finance and increased levels of transactions.'
Housebuilders have expressed concern that the revival in house sales has
faltered in recent weeks.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said on
Monday that a lack of consumer confidence was having a 'particularly severe
impact on the private housing market which, having shown an improvement in
prospects in the spring, has now faltered'.
Halifax said it expected increased demand for mortgages to feed through to
gradual increases in house prices in the second half of this year.
It added that prices should rise more steadily next year, increasing by
about 5 per cent.
Halifax said the average price of a house last month was Pounds 62,440 - 4.5
per cent lower than 12 months ago.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Move to cut night flying noise at London's airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW night flying restrictions designed to cut noise at London's Heathrow,
Gatwick and Stansted airports are to come into effect from Oct-ober.
The government announced yesterday that a quota system based on the amount
of noise made by different types of aircraft would be introduced, replacing
the present regime based on the number of aircraft movements. Under the new
system, which will operate for five years, the noisier the aircraft the more
its use at night will use up an airport's quota.
Separate regulations will ensure that noisier aircraft, such as the BAC
1-11, will be phased out within a decade.
Announcing the move in a parliamentary written answer, Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, said he had tried to maintain a balance between the
aviation industry and local people.
He said the new system would help to ensure those living near the airports
could enjoy 'a good night's sleep'. The new regime would be 'tough on
industry' and was 'a challenge to them to maintain progress at introducing
quieter aircraft'.
BAA, which owns and runs the three London airports, said airlines would be
encouraged by the quota system to schedule their quieter aircraft for use at
Heathrow.
The company said: 'Our aim is to ensure that our airports attract quiet,
premium planes.'
BAA said the new arrangements would also mean planes arriving at Heathrow
from the Far East in the early morning, ahead of schedule, would not have to
be stacked over south-east England before 6am.
The airports define night-time as between 11pm and 6am.
British Airways said the new scheme would clear up inconsistencies and
inflexibilities, but BA's expansion plans would be affected.
The company said: 'We were looking to land two extra flights from the Middle
East.' There would be no scope for those flights under the new regulations,
it added.
Britannia Airways, the charter airline, puts 11,000 flights a year through
Gatwick and 2,000 a year through Stansted.
The company said it broadly welcomed the new restrictions as better than the
previous ones, and said it would be given greater flexi-bility.
The airline said there would have been greater incentive for airlines to
invest in newer, quieter aircraft if the government had decided to give
unlimited landing access to the so-called super-quiet aircraft, such as the
Boeing 757 and Airbus A320.

reduce City 'mega-trials' ruled out - Custody video recording recommended /
Lawyers express alarm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal Commission on Criminal Justice put 'justice first and efficiency
second' before finally publishing its 352 recommendations, its chairman Lord
Runciman said yesterday.
Yet in attempting to find the right balance between prosecution and defence,
the commission has made a number of inroads into long-established and
fundamental rights of defendants. These include the right to elect trial by
jury and the so-called right to silence.
The commission was set up in March 1991 with the primary task of
recommending changes to the criminal justice system to prevent further
miscarriages of justice. Launching the commission's report yesterday, Lord
Runciman said it had taken a much broader view of its remit: its
recommendations were aimed as much at reducing the risk of the guilty being
acquitted as trying to prevent the conviction of the innocent, he said.
Of the proposals for change only 22 are directly related to correcting
miscarriages of justice. Almost half of the remainder are addressed at
improving efficiency and productivity in the system.
The most controversial recommendation is to abolish the defendant's right to
elect trial by jury in cases which can either be tried by magistrates or
crown courts. This proposal is opposed by the legal profession, many senior
judges including Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, who has called it 'an
inalienable right stretching back to Magna Carta', and by civil liberties
groups.
The commission was urged to adopt this proposal by Mrs Barbara Mills QC,
director of public prosecutions, as a way of cutting costs and delays in the
system by limiting the number of crown court cases.
Of roughly 100,000 cases committed by magistrates to the crown court each
year, about 30,000 go there because defendants elect jury trial. The average
daily cost of a crown court trial in 1992-93 was Pounds 6,850. The daily
cost of trial by magistrates is unknown, but is estimated at less than half
that figure.
Lord Runciman yesterday denied that this was purely a cost-cutting measure.
He said most defendants opted for jury trial in the mistaken belief that
they would either receive a fairer trial or a lighter sentence. Research
showed that crown court judges were three times as likely to impose a
custodial sentence and sentences were on average 2 1/2 times as long.
Lord Runciman said the recommendation that magistrates should decide whether
a case should go to the crown court when prosecution and defence could not
agree would make the system 'quicker, fairer and more consistent'.
Defence lawyers dispute that. Lord Williams QC, last year's Bar chairman,
has said that allowing magistrates to decide according to factors, such as
the defendant's reputation, would result in jury trial being allowed 'for
the vicar's wife, but not for the postman or the betting-shop manager'.
The commission has preserved the basic principle that a person is innocent
until proven guilty by recommending that defendants should keep their right
to remain silent at the police station.
Yet in spite of research that suggested a defendant's silence was not a
problem in the vast majority of cases, the commission has made significant
inroads into the right to silence. It has recommended that defendants who
intend to advance a defence at trial must tell the prosecution the substance
of it before the trial or risk adverse comment being made to the jury.
The commission has also failed to recommend a requirement that confessions
should be corroborated before they can be admissible as evidence at trial in
spite of the fact that disputed confessions have been central to the
overwhelming majority of recent miscarriages of justice.
It has chosen instead to recommend that judges should warn juries of the
dangers of convicting on the basis of confessions alone.
The measures aimed directly at preventing and correcting alleged
miscarriages of justice have been warmly welcomed. Among these is the
establishment of an independent review authority to take responsibility from
the Home Office for investigating and referring suspect cases back to the
Court of Appeal. Concerns remain however that the actual investigation of
alleged miscarriages of justice will still be carried out by the police.
The establishment of an independent forensic science advisory council to
oversee standards and ensure forensic science facilities are available
equally to defence and prosecution has also been welcomed.
Measures to tighten police procedures, introduce video recording in police
stations, and the overall emphasis on the need for higher standards and more
training for police, defence lawyers and judges should help to reduce
further miscarriages of justice.

FT  07 JUL 93 / 'Failure' over miscarriages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS and law reform groups yesterday attacked the royal commission for
being more concerned with efficiency than justice.
The proposal to abolish the defendant's right to jury trial was condemned by
the Bar and the Law Society and by groups such as the Legal Action Group and
Liberty.
While welcoming the measures to investigate and correct wrongful
convictions, Mr John Rowe QC, chairman of the Bar, said: 'The central
failure of the commission's report is that it has not analysed why these
miscarriages occurred or made sufficient recommendations to prevent future
miscarriages.'
The Law Society accused the commission of a 'short-term approach' and of
having 'chosen to steer a middle course rather than undertake a strategic
review'.
The society was pleased that the commission had maintained the right to
silence in the police station.
Mr Roger Smith, Legal Action Group's director, said the report had been too
influenced by the commission's perception that there was a need for greater
balance between defence and prosecution. More attention should have been
given to preventing miscarriages of justice of the kind that led to the
report.
'The commission's package of measures reflects a desire to improve the
efficiency of the administration of justice rather than its effectiveness,'
Mr Smith said.
Liberty, the civil liberties group, attacked the commission's failure to
insist on independent evidence to corroborate confessions. Mr John Wadham,
Liberty's legal officer, said: 'Uncorroborated confession evidence remains
one of the biggest single causes of innocent people going to prison.'
Police representatives gave a general welcome to the report, but warned that
the service should not be expected to implement its recommendations from
existing budgets.
Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of the Association of
Chief Police Officers, said it had been estimated that it might cost Pounds
9m to Pounds 10m to meet the single recommendation of putting video cameras
in police station custody suites. If proposals with resource implications
had to be met from existing police budgets they would 'seriously reduce
improvements in other areas of criminal investigation, and take officers
away from the fight against crime'.
The report makes recommendations on police disciplinary procedures, an issue
now under review by the Home Office. In a change of policy yesterday the
Police Federation, which represents all ranks up to chief inspector,
announced that it would accept a recommendation for a lower level of proof
in disciplinary hearings.
At present the police service's internal disciplinary hearings require the
same level of proof as a criminal court. Mr Kenneth Clarke, before he left
the Home Office, was shouted down when he argued for dropping the criminal
standard of proof at the Police Federation conference in May. But Mr Alan
Eastwood, chairman, said yesterday that the federation's council had agreed
to accept a lower level of proof.
Mr Burrow said he saw some advantages to the proposed restrictions on jury
trial. But the decision was ultimately a political one, which should be
taken after an informed public debate.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Michelangelo reaches record for Old Master drawings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the last major drawings by Michelangelo still in private hands, 'The
Holy Family with the Infant Baptist on the Rest on the Flight into Egypt',
sold for Pounds 4,181,500 at Christie's in London yesterday, a record for an
Old Master drawing.
The price was anticipated, as was the buyer, the Getty Museum of Malibu,
California, which had just one competitor. The only element of excitement in
the two minutes of bidding was when the Getty's curator, Dr George Goldner,
made a bid to ensure that the official bidder for the Getty, Ms Katrin
Bellinger, could return to bidding in even numbers to ensure that she kept
to the upper limit approved by the board.
The drawing had once belonged to the British artist Sir Thomas Lawrence. It
was sold in the 1830s for 250 guineas and for more than a century has been
hidden away at the Great Tew, Oxfordshire, mansion of the reclusive Major
Eustace Robb.
The Getty is keen to acquire works by all the masters and with little chance
of a Michelangelo oil appearing on the market it was 'happy to have the
drawing'. Dr Goldner said: 'To get a large major example is something we are
thrilled about.'
The other important lot of the day - two portrait miniatures in a single
frame of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, by Hans Holbein the Younger -
failed to sell. This was a great disappointment. Fewer than 20 miniatures by
Holbein have survived and these two have an excellent provenance, descending
through the Blount family for 400 years until the 1930s. Christie's had
fixed an estimate of Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 750,000 on the lot, but the
bidding petered out at Pounds 350,000.
The miniatures came from the collection of the late Dr Anton F. Philips. All
told nine of the 14 miniatures from his estate found buyers for a total of
Pounds 216,692. A portrait of a noblewoman by Nicholas Hilliard sold for
Pounds 84,000, at the bottom of its estimate.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Anger over 'outrageous' hospital development remarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH controversy about the closure of some of London's hospitals has
erupted after a leading firm of property advisers described them as 'the
London development sites of the 90s'.
Save, a conservation group, described comments by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
chartered surveyors, about the development opportunities presented by
hospital closures as 'outrageous' and showing 'complete insensitivity to the
importance of the architecture of London hospitals'.
It particularly criticised a description of the site occupied by St Thomas's
opposite the Houses of Parliament as 'a prestigious residential development
site with its unique picture postcard view'.
The group said wholesale clearance of the site would destroy some historic
buildings that gave St Thomas's an 'Italian skyline of cupolas and finials
complementing the richness and intricacy of the Gothic silhouette of the
Palace of Westminster opposite'.
The group said the sites of historic hospitals in central London 'should be
considered, not only as potential sites for penthouses and luxurious
apartments, but as sites for lower cost and rental housing'.
Mr Stephan Miles Brown, head of residential developments at Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley, said that the scope for redeveloping sites of hospitals being
considered for closure was highly relevant if their sale was expected to
provide some of the funding for remaining centres.
The site of St Thomas's could be worth more than Pounds 25m, he said. 'It is
a true international piece of real estate,' he added.
Many of the sites that were likely to become vacant would not attract
developers because they are not in prime locations, he said. 'Most hospitals
are not as valuable as people think they might be,' he said.
Only two other London hospitals facing the threat of closure are in prime
residential sites, the Royal Marsden in Chelsea and the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital for Children in Hackney.
St Bartholomew's in the City is the least suitable site for redevelopment of
all nine London hospitals facing closure, according to Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley. The oversupply of offices in the City would mean it was not viable
to redevelop as office space, it said.
Mr John Locke, chief executive of NHS Estates, which advises the health
service on property management, said the health service conducted
feasibility studies on the redevelopment of sites. The future of each
building was considered on its own merits, he said.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Hi-tech measures urged to aid police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREATER USE of technology to assist and monitor police investigations is
proposed by the commission, although it acknowledges that nothing can wholly
eliminate the risk of an innocent person being convicted 'due to error or
malpractice'.
It says the police should have powers to take saliva and hair samples to
identify suspects through DNA profiling - genetic fingerprinting - and calls
for a national DNA data bank of samples from serious offenders.
The commission wants custody records computerised to reduce the risk of
falsification; video recording or colour photography of all identification
parades, and continuous sound-track video recording in the custody office
and cell corridors - but not cells - of police stations. A video record
would reduce the scope for complaints against the police and enable
complaints to be more readily resolved.
Police interview techniques are subjected to criticism in the report, which
says there is evidence that questioning of suspects is 'often rambling,
repetitious and insufficiently focused on the real issues'. More serious
criticisms include an 'over-ready assumption on the part of some
interviewing officers of the suspect's guilt and on occasion the exertion of
undue pressure amounting to bullying or harassment'.
New national training in basic interview skills introduced by the Home
Office should, says the report, inculcate techniques that were most likely
to elicit the truth. 'Much will be achieved by instilling in officers a
recognition that oppressive interviews are liable to be inaccurate.'
A new approach to supervision is needed throughout the police service, with
line managers at all levels being required to regard it as central to their
roles. The report emphasises the need for adequate inspection procedures to
detect the beginnings of malpractice before it becomes entrenched, and
helplines for individual officers to report concerns confidentially.
The commission doubts whether internal police disciplinary procedures
command the confidence of the general public. It calls for fewer hearings
and abandonment of the present criminal standard of proof. Acquittal in a
criminal court should not be a bar to internal disciplinary action.

FT  07 JUL 93 / SFO call for US-style plea bargains rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLS BY the Serious Fraud Office for a US-style of plea-bargaining to help
reduce the number of controversial City 'mega-trials' have been rejected by
the Royal Commission.
Instead, the commission recommended a system of 'sentence discounts' for
defendants in all criminal proceedings willing to plead guilty before a
trial starts.
However, it stopped far short of agreeing with the SFO that prosecutors
should have an active role in offering lower sentences to suspects in
exchange for increased co-operation.
Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, had argued that the introduction
of formal plea bargaining was the most effective way of shortening the
process of prosecuting fraud.
This was rejected by the commission as too extreme. Lord Runciman yesterday
emphasised the commission's view that sentencing issues should be determined
by judges alone with prosecutors playing no role in deciding penalties.
The commission suggested a number of improvements to the investigation and
prosecution of fraud cases, including forcing defence teams to give a
detailed outline of their cases at an earlier stage.
However, the general reaction of lawyers was that the commission had
addressed matters of detail rather than proposing major reform and that its
proposals, if implemented, would have only marginal impact on the problem of
the large fraud trial. This, as one lawyer said, reflected the 'bolting on'
of fraud trial reform to the commission's agenda after it had begun
addressing its central concern of miscarriages of justice.
The SFO welcomed the report, saying it was pleased the commission had
reflected some of its views.
Recommendations made by the commission for the investigation and prosecution
of fraud include:
Greater disclosure by defence lawyers of their clients' case to the
prosecution before the trial starts. Defence lawyers can now say merely that
they oppose the prosecution's case. They should have to state their attitude
on individual details of the prosecution case, the commission suggests.
Trial by jury should remain.
The 'Section 2' powers of the SFO, which remove the right to silence and
compel witnesses to answer questions - should be extended to allow police
officers, as well as SFO lawyers and accountants, to carry out such
interviews. Evidence gathered in Section 2 interviews should remain
inadmissible in court, unless it contradicts evidence given in court by a
defendant.
A feasibility study should be carried out into the possible merging of the
SFO with the Fraud Investigation Group. The commission said there was no
justification for the group, which is part of the Crown Prosecution Service,
not having the same Section 2 powers as the SFO.
Time limits on fraud trials could be introduced, provided they remained
flexible.
Judges should be able to outline a case's basic issues to the jury at the
start of a trial.
Fraud defendants should be able to be able to plead guilty to a serious
regulatory offence subject to the disciplinary sanctions of the Securities
and Investments Board, rather than face criminal charges, although this
should only be available in a strictly limited type of case.
Reactions among fraud solicitors were muted.
Mr John Clitheroe of Kingsley Napley said the recommendations would not
fundamentally advance the present state of affairs. However, he questioned
the wisdom of suggesting police carry out Section 2 interviews when they
also carried out the interviews with suspects which could later be used as
evidence in court.
Mr Anthony Vernon of Richards Butler said sentence discounts would have less
effect with fraud than in other types of crime. With fraud, the issues
involved often only became clear at a comparatively late stage. To encourage
early guilty pleas in these circumstances might amount to undesirable
'horse-trading', he said.

   TWO large bombs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one weighing 2,000lb and the other 800lb - were seized in Northern Ireland
yesterday after police chased a gang for three miles through the South
Armagh countryside. One man was arrested. The chase happened just 12 hours
after the centre of Newtownards in Co Down was devastated by a bomb placed
in a van. Nineteen people were injured but none badly.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, denied last night that the
IRA was succeeding. 'The IRA do not, as yet, realise that they are bound to
fail, though upon many of them that truth is dawning,' he said.
He also hit out at Ulster critics of security policies. He said: 'Consider
if we were to match the brutality of the IRA with our own actions and
persuade those who work for us to do the same. That would take us into a
cesspit as noisome as the one the IRA themselves inhabit.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / Clothing company plans 600 jobs
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESMOND AND SONS yesterday announced plans to create 600 jobs in Northern
Ireland in the biggest single investment ever made by an Ulster-owned
clothing company.
The Pounds 24m plan, which is being backed by the Industrial Development
Board, will result in 400 jobs and a purpose-built factory at Magherafelt in
south Londonderry. The announcement is particularly timely as the town was
devastated by an IRA bomb earlier this year. That followed the closure of
two large factories last year.
The investment programme will also add 200 new jobs and improve the
efficiency of the company's existing Northern Ireland plants. The company
currently employs 2,700 in 11 factories across the province.
Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland's economy minister, said: 'The fact that
most of the investment is going to Magherafelt is good news for a town which
has suffered a number of setbacks in the last year.
'Growing demand for Desmond ladieswear - such as shorts and pyjamas - is the
largest single reason for the new investment throughout the group.'
Mr Clinton Silver, deputy chairman of Marks and Spencer, Desmond's main
customer, said the company's ability to compete successfully against
international competition was a clear indication of how M and S regarded the
company's ability to work to world-class standards.
Desmond has bought the former Coats Vyella factory in Magherafelt which it
will use for pilot production while the new plant is built on a site near
the town.
Mr Denis Desmond, company chairman, said: 'The new investment programme
forms a core of our current five-year strategy. The key factors in this
strategy, as in the past, will be market intelligence, design and speed of
response.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / Drug clears market hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, has been given
provisional clearance to sell its best-selling prescription medicine,
Tagamet, without a prescription in UK chemists.
The group expects to be able to market the drug by the end of the year.
Tagamet is an anti-ulcer treatment which had worldwide sales last year of
more than Dollars 1bn.
'This is tremendous news for SB especially given that Tagamet's patents
expire in the US next year,' said Mr Paul Krikler, analyst at Goldman Sachs.
'It should add weight to the company's US application to switch Tagamet's
status from prescription only to over-the-counter (OTC).'
Brokers Hoare Govett estimates Tagamet could eventually generate OTC sales
of between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m a year, although the UK market will
be a small component.
Mr Jan Leschley, head of the group's pharmaceuticals division and chief
executive designate, has warned that the drug will be less profitable when
it is OTC because of additional marketing costs.
The UK's committee on safety of medicines said the drug could be used for
heartburn, dyspepsia and acid stomach (hyperacidity). The committee has
decided that Tagamet is safe and effective for these illnesses, which are
common and generally of short duration. The committee's approval was the
most significant hurdle to switching Tagamet's status. The move now requires
government approval.
The company already has two OTC products in this area, Settlers and Tums,
and will have to position the product carefully.
It has not yet announced the new brand-name or the dosing which is likely to
determine its price.
Mr Nigel Barnes, analyst at Hoare Govett, said: 'The good news is that SB
appears to have cracked the dosing problem. If the dose is too high it could
mask serious illnesses. If too low it could be no more effective than
existing treatments. It's a positive step that the committee has approved
it.'
When prescribed for ulcers the dose is normally 800mg a day. The clinical
trials for the OTC version have been at 100mg, 200mg and 300mg. It was
tested on 2,000 patients.

FT  07 JUL 93 / BBC moves to reverse decline in audience share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC admitted yesterday that its performance in popular drama was
disappointing and said action was being taken to deal with the ratings
problem.
Mr Charles Denton, head of drama, said there was no shame in admitting that
the BBC had not done as well as expected in popular drama.
Speaking at the unveiling of management restructuring at BBC Television, he
said action was being taken and the results would be seen by the autumn.
His comments came on the day when ratings from Barb, the official audience
measurement organisation, showed that in the week to June 27 the BBC1 share
of the audience fell to 28.9 per cent, the lowest since 1985.
The low ratings could be a quirk. BBC2, which had extensive coverage of the
Wimbledon championships, had a healthy 15.1 per cent of the audience. The
May average for BBC1 was 32 per cent compared with 40 per cent for ITV.
A sustained decline in the ratings on such a scale could be embarrassing
while the BBC is pressing the government for the renewal of its charter with
continued licence fee funding.
The BBC changes announced yesterday included a separation of the functions
of programme commissioning and scheduling and the launching of a charter for
independent producers.
Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, said the charter would 'ensure that the
BBC is in a position to broadcast the best possible programmes from whatever
source - BBC or independent, anywhere in the UK.'
There will be new group heads for drama, entertainment, factual programmes,
children's programmes and sport and events. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of
Virgin Group, yesterday renewed his plea for more FM frequencies for
commercial radio in evidence to the Commons national heritage committee.
Mr Branson said a new FM national channel could be carved out of FM
frequencies not fully used by the BBC. If 1,600 people in the Caterham area
were given satellite dishes, enough FM capacity would be freed for new
channels to reach 7.5m people in the London area.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Diesels lead car sales recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A spectacular increase in sales of diesel cars is one of the main
ingredients boosting recovery in the market for new cars.
Nearly one in five cars sold is a diesel, and the 20 per cent level is
likely to be breached by the end of the year.
Registrations of new cars in the first half of this year were 9.14 per cent
higher than in the same period last year at 839,035, and of these 141,974
were diesels.
Diesel sales have increased by 67 per cent over the 87,276 sold in the same
period a year ago and the six-month total is higher than in all of 1991.
Diesels are now by far the fastest growing of any sector for new vehicles
and explain the further strong sales performance put up by Peugeot and
Citroen.
Statistics issued by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
yesterday showed the two French companies' combined share of the market  -
they are both part of the Peugeot group - reached 12.44 per cent in the
first half of the year, little more than one percentage point behind
third-placed Rover Group. Peugeot and Citroen diesel cars hold first and
third places in the 'top ten' list of best-selling diesels cars.
However, Ford continues to be market leader overall, taking 19.93 per cent
of last month's total registrations.
The top five sellers in the first half of the year were: Ford Escort, Ford
Fiesta, Vauxhall Cavalier, Vauxhall Astra and Rover 200 Series.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Social Chapter opt-out defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALASTAIR Goodlad, Foreign Office minister, yesterday launched a fierce
defence of Britain's opt-out from the Social Chapter of the Maastricht
agreement. He insisted that future European success in the face of fierce
competition from east Asia depended on flexibility for employers over wage
rates, and over where to locate.
'We face a choice between a flexible and competitive life, or an
accelerating economic death by drowning in a sea of regulation and rising
costs,' Mr Goodlad said in a speech to the London Chamber of Commerce.
The EC's annual labour report, due to be published today, is expected to
attack Britain's claim that rising social welfare costs hurt
competitiveness.  Mr Goodlad's comments appear aimed at deflecting this
criticism.
'Rising wages, unaccompanied by higher productivity, mean only one thing -
unemployment,' Mr Goodlad said. He pinpointed 'three arresting trends':
EC member states are selling more to each other, are selling less outside
the EC, and are importing more.
Rising labour costs are making European companies less competitive.
Slow growth in Europe is a symptom of declining competitiveness.
'The last thing we need is new, extensive, and burdensome social
harmonisation,' he added. 'That would wreck our competitive position.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / Frustrated loyalists turn violent: Heightened tension
marking Orange Order marches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT eruptions of loyalist violence in Northern Ireland have made a
traditionally fraught weekend more tense.
As the Orange Order marching season reaches its climax, police and
firefighters have come under gun and bomb attack for three consecutive
nights. These have resulted in injuries to 12 civilians and two police
officers. There have been 35 shooting incidents, 21 of them at police, 48
petrol-bomb attacks, 70 malicious fires and 63 vehicle hijacks.
The trigger for the violence may have been the decision by the Royal Ulster
Constabulary to divert an Orange Lodge march last Thursday by a mere 150
yards, away from what is now a predominantly Catholic area around Ainsworth
Avenue in west Belfast.
A hand grenade, carried by a loyalist paramilitary and apparently intended
to be thrown at the police, exploded in the middle of the march, killing the
grenade's carrier and injuring many others. Rioting began after the man's
funeral on Friday.
Unionist leaders say that tensions have been building up for some time in
Protestant communities. Mr Nigel Dodds, a Belfast city councillor for the
Democratic Unionist Party, said: 'We have been warning for some time that
there is a growing sense of alienation amongst the loyalist community. There
is frustration that people are not being listened to. There is fear that the
situation is not under their control. There is a perception that more money
is now going into republican areas than loyalist ones, and that it is now
harder for Protestants to get jobs than for Catholics.'
A number of events have added to a growing siege mentality among loyalists.
These include the recent controversial visit of Mrs Mary Robinson, president
of the Irish Republic, to west Belfast where she shook hands with Mr Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein president; the bilateral talks between Mr John Hume,
SDLP leader, and Mr Adams; and the failure to restart the round-table
political talks process since November.
There has been a rapid increase in loyalist paramilitary attacks. The RUC
says there have been 29 civilian deaths from paramilitary activity so far
this year, the majority of them attributable to loyalists. The constabulary
adds it has stepped up its policing of loyalist housing estates 'as the
level of crime has necessitated'. It is this, as much as anything, which has
apparently angered the loyalist paramilitary. Last weekend, the outlawed
Ulster Freedom Fighters said they were behind the rioting and warned the RUC
to stop 'its repression of loyalist paramilitaries'.
The re-routeing of the march was thus seen as the final stir of an already
dangerously boiling pot.
According to Mr Dodds: 'The (paramilitaries) would not have been on the
streets if the parade had not been diverted.' He said that the march's
routeing was seen as interference from Dublin and that the RUC 'are acting
at the behest of Dublin. It's none of their business where marches go in
Northern Ireland.'
The Irish Republic's foreign ministry acknowledged yesterday that the
routeing of Orange marches in Ulster 'is always a matter of concern to the
Irish government' and said the issue is a matter of 'ongoing discussions'
between the two governments.
The ministry said the concern is for the right to demonstrate 'with due
respect for the rights and sensibilities of others and with due regard for
the maintenance of public order'.
The controversy appears to be deepening with allegations that an officer
from the RUC negotiated directly with a member of the Ulster Defence
Association last weekend in an effort to reduce loyalist street violence.
According to the RUC there are no plans for re-routeing this weekend's
marches. Around 18 are due to be held across the province. The biggest will
be in Belfast next Monday to mark William of Orange's victory at the Battle
of the Boyne in 1690 over James II which ended the latter's attempt to win
back the British crown for the Catholic church.
For most republicans, the Orange marches with their beating drums, banners
and Union Jacks, are a provocative affirmation of Protestant supremacy in
the province, especially when they are allowed to be routed through
predominantly Catholic areas. Protestants for their part are equally
incensed by the ubiquitous flying of the Irish tricolour in many republican
neighbourhoods.
So instead of re-routeing marches this weekend, the RUC plans to have a
heavy security presence at flashpoints such as the Lower Ormeau Road in
Belfast where five Catholics were killed in February last year in a loyalist
attack on a bookmaker's shop.
Whether this will be sufficient to prevent trouble remains to be seen, and
the appearance of gun and grenade-toting loyalist paramilitaries on the
marches ready to do battle with the police is not a good omen.
Mr Dodds said: 'I believe there is a grave danger of the situation
deteriorating.' To defuse the tensions he said that the British government
must take 'a firmer stance' with Dublin - the republic should drop its
territorial claim to Northern Ireland. 'This will get unionists back to the
negotiating table. Otherwise any renewed talks will only end in failure or
betrayal and we are not going to be part of either.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / Nadir hits setback in Polly battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, yesterday suffered a blow to his
stated intention of regaining control of Polly Peck International companies.
A court in the Isle of Man dismissed an appeal claiming that control of an
important holding company had been passed to Mr Nadir, the former head of
PPI.
The move means that administrators to PPI are a step closer to recovering
some of the group's assets in Turkey.
Mr Mentes Aziz and Mr Fahri Tunalier, directors of Voyager, a subsidiary of
PPI based in the Isle of Man, were appealing yesterday against a Manx court
ruling made last year.
In November the court ruled that a transfer of shares to Mr Nadir from
Voyager for Pounds 8m in October 1990 was null and void. The meeting at
which the share transfer was agreed had been improperly constituted because
one of the company's British directors had not been told about it, the court
had decided.
Voyager had held the shares in AN Graphics, a Turkish printing and
publishing company which the administrators from accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand say is also the beneficial owner of stakes in Vestel, Meyna, Unipac
and Askan, PPI's most significant businesses in Turkey.
Coopers, however, still faces legal difficulties in asserting its ownership.
It said last night that a legal battle was continuing in Turkey over a
previous court ruling there that the shares could not be re-registered in
the administrators' names until Mr Nadir had been repaid.
But Coopers said there was no evidence that the Pounds 8m had ever been
received from Mr Nadir in exchange for the AN Graphics shares.
Mr David Doyle, Manx advocate for Mr Aziz and Mr Tunalier, told yesterday's
appeal court in the Isle of Man that the differences between the
administrators and his clients had been settled by agreement.
Following the agreement he had filed a motion with the court on June 29
seeking dismissal of the appeal, he said. The appeal deemsters (the judges)
accordingly dismissed the appeal and, as requested, made no order as to
costs.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Anger at remarks over hospital sites
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH controversy about the closure of some of London's hospitals has
broken out after a leading firm of property advisers described them as 'the
London development sites of the 90s'.
Save, a conservation group, described comments by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
chartered surveyors, about development opportunities presented by hospital
closures as 'outrageous' and showing 'complete insensitivity to the
importance of the architecture of London hospitals'. It particularly
criticised a description of the site occupied by St Thomas's opposite the
Houses of Parliament as 'a prestigious residential development site with its
unique picture postcard view'.
Mr Stephan Miles Brown, head of residential developments at Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley, said the scope for redeveloping sites of hospitals being considered
for closure was relevant if their sale was expected to provide some of the
funding for remaining centres.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Prescott criticises City cordon
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Prescott, shadow transport secretary, yesterday strongly criticised
the City's anti-terrorist cordon. He said the City authorities had not
consulted other traffic authorities before implementing the controversial
scheme, Gillian Tett writes.
Echoing concern in some Whitehall departments, he said that neither the
traffic director for London nor London Transport had been consulted by the
police.
Commander Hugh Moore of the City of London Police said: 'The consultation
period had to be limited because of the security issues.'
The Corporation of London said the new scheme had been a complete success
and pointed out that the widely predicted traffic congestion had failed to
materialise so far.
However, Mr Prescott insisted the situation could rapidly deteriorate. He
said: 'We are entering the summer holiday period when many people are not
travelling to work. When everybody returns it will be a different story, and
it will be traffic chaos.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / Warning over contracting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT could face retrospective claims from tens of thousands of
public service workers who experienced a deterioration in pay and conditions
when their jobs were contracted out to the private sector.
Mr Jack Dromey, a national secretary of the TGWU general union, told the
union's conference yesterday that hundreds of test cases were being prepared
and would go to court if the government rejected a general settlement.
The issue has arisen because of the European Community's Tupe legislation
which protects the pay and conditions of workers in many cases of job
transfer.
Although Tupe has been part of British law since 1981, it is only recently
that the government has acknowledged that its provisions can apply to
contracting out.
Mr Dromey says that up to 25,000 workers in local and central government and
the National Health Service had their pay reduced before it was realised
that they were protected by Tupe and that the government should now pay up.
The compensation sums involved are estimated to be in the tens of millions
of pounds and Mr Dromey said that the government faced the prospect of
spending more than that in legal fees if it did not agree a settlement.
He added: 'The government has a choice over Tupe - an expensive decade of
chaos or a settlement.'

NEW night-flying restrictions designed to cut noise at Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted airports are to start in October, David Owen writes.
The government announced yesterday that a new quota system based on the
noise of different types of aircraft would be introduced, replacing the
current regime based on the number of aircraft movements.
Under the new system, the louder the aircraft, the more its use at night
will use up an airport's quota.
Separate regulations will ensure that louder aircraft, such as the BAC 1-11,
will be phased out within a decade. The new system is to operate for five
years.

FT  07 JUL 93 / New high-speed Stena ferry in service by 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STENA Sealink Line, the Swedish-owned UK ferry operator, is to put the
world's largest high-speed ferry into service in 1995 on its Irish Sea route
between Holyhead and Dun Laoghaire, Richard Tomkins writes. Parent company
Stena has ordered two of the vessels from Finnyards in Rauma, Finland, at a
cost of about Pounds 130m. The second vessel, to be delivered in 1996, will
be available for charter.
The 124-metre ferries will be able to carry 1,500 passengers plus 375 cars
or 100 cars and 50 lorries. The largest design at present in service, the
74-metre SeaCat operated by Hoverspeed, takes 400 passengers and 80 cars.
Stena said the new ferries would travel at 40 knots and would be less
sensitive to rough weather than smaller vessels.
P&amp;O European Ferries, Stena Sealink's biggest rival on UK routes, said it
continued to watch developments in high-speed ferries but was not yet
convinced of their advantages.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Nigerians told to defy Babangida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S political crisis deepened yesterday as Mr Moshood Abiola, apparent
winner of presidential elections scrapped by the military government, urged
defiance of an ultimatum from President Ibrahim Babangida.
The stand-off came as unrest increased in Lagos with businesses closed and
thousands of protesters said to be blocking roads and starting fires. There
were unconfirmed reports that at least eight people had been killed - the
first such reports since civilian protests began on Monday. An army
spokesman denied claims that soldiers had shot dead at least 10 people in
the suburb of Ikoyi.
General Sani Abacha, chief of defence staff, gave the Lagos state governor
24 hours to restore order and the armed forces were ordered to help the
police.
At least two African airlines cancelled flights to Lagos and expatriates
trying to get their families out of Nigeria found their way to the airport
blocked by protesters.
Earlier yesterday Gen Babangida offered the two civilian political parties -
Mr Abiola's Social Democratic party and the National Republican Convention -
a role in an interim national government. This would involve dissolving all
democratic institutions and was proposed as an alternative to holding fresh
elections at the end of July.
The proposal is an apparent attempt to meet the deadline for ending military
rule on August 27 without confirming the victory of Mr Abiola in the June
polls.
The president has given the two parties until tomorrow to consider the
options. If they accept the national government proposal, all the elected
civilian arms of government are likely to be dissolved, including local
councils, state governors and the House of Assembly. The two parties could
also be scrapped.
Mr Abiola, speaking from Lagos, last night urged elected officials to stay
in their positions and 'damn the consequences'. Other members of the SDP
may, however, be prepared to take up the president's offer.
According to a state radio broadcast yesterday Gen Babangida said the
proposed national government would not include him and he urged the parties
to adopt the plan in the national interest, 'to achieve a termination of the
military regime by August 27'.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Back to basics for healthcare: The World Bank says that
child mortality rates remain 10 times as high as in the richest countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries could reduce the burden of disease by up to a third by
spending less on high-tech medicine and more on basic public health and
clinical services the World Bank says in its latest World Development
Report.
The report, published today, says the high incidence of disease and
disability is caused as much by the poor allocation of existing resources as
by a lack of funds. In some countries, one teaching hospital, catering
mainly for the affluent, can absorb 20 per cent or more of the national
healthcare budget.
The report urges poor and middle income countries to invest in a minimum
healthcare package comprising routine public health measures and a few
essential clinical services. Such services could be provided by local
clinics and district hospitals and would not need expensive equipment or
highly-trained specialists.
On public health, the most cost-effective measures include expanding
immunisation services for children, school-based health services, campaigns
to reduce levels of smoking and alcohol consumption, information about
nutrition and family planning, and efforts to prevent the spread of Aids.
Clinical services should include at least prenatal and delivery care, family
planning, tuberculosis control, care for childhood diseases and simple
treatments for sexually-transmitted diseases. Hospital- based emergency care
should be provided depending on capacity and resources.
In the poorest countries, the cost of this minimum package *something in
here (HP) *
would be about Dollars 12 per person a year, or just over 3 per cent of per
capita income. Bank estimates indicate this modest investment could reduce
the burden of disease by more than 30 per cent. In middle income countries,
the minimum package would cost about Dollars 22 per person or roughly 1 per
cent of per capita incomes. It could reduce the burden of disease by about
15 per cent.
Adopting the package in all developing countries would require a quadrupling
of expenditure on public health, from about Dollars 5bn to Dollars 20bn a
year, and a doubling of spending on essential clinical services to Dollars
40bn.
In middle income countries, where public healthcare expenditure is already
about Dollars 60 per person a year, the package could be financed out of
existing resources provided existing spending on less cost-effective
discretionary services, such as heart surgery, was reduced.
In the poorest countries public spending on healthcare is only about Dollars
6 per person a year. The bank's minimum package would thus require a
substantial increase in spending by governments, donors and patients, as
well as a redirection of the healthcare budget from specialised facilities
for the affluent.
Such measures would work best if accompanied by broader efforts to reduce
household poverty and improve education, the report says.
Studies show people with more schooling utilise health information more
effectively than those without. 'Education of girls and women is
particularly beneficial to household health because it is largely women who
buy and prepare food, and initiate contacts with the health system.'
The bank emphasises the importance of promoting diversity and competition in
the supply of health services. In the short term, reforms in drug
procurement offer the greatest efficiency gains. Governments that have
introduced competition in drug procurement and switched from brand name to
generic drugs have achieved savings of 40-60 per cent.
The report says developing countries have made great strides in improving
health conditions. In the past four decades, life expectancy has risen from
40 years to 63 years and the number of children dying before their fifth
birthday has dropped from nearly three in 10 to one in 10.
However, child mortality rates remain about 10 times as high as the richest
countries while maternal mortality rates can be up to 30 times higher.
In the past 6 years, the bank has quadrupled to Dollars 1.5bn a year its
lending for healthcare services in poor countries. If diseases such as Aids
and tuberculosis are to be controlled, other donors and institutions need to
put greater emphasis on supporting cost-effective health services, it says.

FT  07 JUL 93 / S Africa clashes leave 116 dead
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RIVAL BLACK groups fought running battles in the streets of two South
African townships yesterday, pushing the nationwide death toll in the past
four days of fighting to at least 116.
A junior official of the African National Congress, without offering
evidence, claimed that the fighting - which eased last night - was an
attempt to sabotage the transition to democracy after last week's
multi-party agreement to set a date for the first multi-racial elections.
Mr Ronnie Mamoepa, an official of the ANC's Johannesburg region, said: 'It
is an attempt to blackmail the country, with the blood of our people, into
delaying the advent of democracy.'
However, peace monitors in the twin townships of Thokoza and Kathlehong near
Johannesburg, where over half the killings have taken place, played down
suggestions that the violence was directly connected to the election date.
They said rival factions in the two neighbouring townships, which owe broad
allegiance to the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom party
respectively, have fought many bloody battles since 1990, with many hundreds
killed.
Political rivalry explains only part of the motivation of the killings,
which often follow a cycle of revenge.
The two rival groups - residents of the Phola Park squatter camp and of the
migrant worker hostels - are also divided along ethnic lines, the former
group mainly Xhosa and the latter mainly Zulu.
Peace monitors said violence was often sparked by attacks from unidentified
gunmen whom they suspected had right-wing connections. However, no such
incident was reported during the latest outbreak and neither they nor the
ANC had any evidence of who was involved.
They blamed police for abandoning their post in the two townships, saying
police had pulled out overnight and only returned in the morning to collect
20 more bodies.
Whatever its cause, the violence - centred on Thokoza and Kathlehong, as
well as the notoriously violent Natal province - highlights the difficulty
of conducting free and fair elections in a climate of political instability.
Violence seems certain to increase once the political parties begin active
campaigning for the elections, which are due to take place on April 27 next
year.
Mindful of this, the leaders of the ANC and Inkatha, Mr Nelson Mandela and
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, held a peace summit 10 days ago in an attempt to
tame the violence. They agreed to hold joint peace rallies in Natal, where
violence has raged for more than eight years.
However, the recent outbreak demonstrates how little control the two leaders
have over their followers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMELL of roasting human flesh hung in the air. A crowd of 20 with
spears, axes and stones gathered round three burning bodies lying behind
refuse bins.
'Sizitholile Izinja. Siyazitshisa,' they chanted. 'We found the dogs and we
are burning them. Viva, ANC Viva.'
The victims - two men and a woman - were supporters of Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.
Shots and screams indicated more killings nearby. There was no sign of
police.
I have lived in the township of Kathlehong for all my 36 years, but I have
never seen such savagery as I witnessed on Monday night and yesterday
morning as I went to rescue my sister, who was trapped in her home deep in
the battle zone.
It is impossible to keep track of casualties in Kathlehong and nearby
Thokoza. Police say 69 have died in three days. Residents speak of hundreds.
To get through the carnage I had to plead with armed youths, many no more
than 16, who wanted everything - my car, money and petrol to make bombs.
'Tell the world there is also a Sarajevo here,' said one when I said I was a
journalist.
'It is a shame that we are made to go through this,' my sister said when I
reached her.
'This country boasts some of Africa's most enlightened leaders, but where
are they when people die like flies?'
Violence exploded in the townships near Johannesburg following last Friday's
announcement of a date for an election which is meant to liberate blacks
from 350 years of white domination.
The immediate cause appears to have been the ambush of a funeral procession
when it passed a hostel populated by Inkatha supporters on Saturday.
But the political tensions building ahead of next April's elections are such
that it needs only a spark to ignite a conflagration.
Black leaders such as the ANC's Nelson Mandela blame apartheid for much of
the violence that has claimed 9,000 lives since the white minority
government began dismantling racial segregation in 1990.
Residents say the police have done nothing to halt the killings. They
abandon the townships as darkness falls, and only return at dawn to collect
the bodies.

FT  07 JUL 93 / UN report calls for new policies on migration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW policies are needed to cope with a rising tide of migration, both from
the country to the city and across national borders, according to a new
report from the United Nations Population Fund*.
The report warns that millions of migrants will create economic and social
strains in countries of immigration and emigration. Governments will have to
take new measures to reduce the pressure to migrate, such as improving
education, health care and family planning in rural areas, but must also
improve the capacity of urban areas to absorb new migrants.
'The only effective means of reducing migration pressure over the long term
are to slow population growth, stimulate economic growth and job creation at
home, and to promote the development of the individual and the family as the
basic economic and social unit,' the report says.
But government policies aimed specifically at limiting rural-urban migration
have generally been unsuccessful, the report says, because they have not
been linked to the country's overall trade, industrial and agricultural
policies, which exert a much stronger pressure on population movement than
regional strategies.
The report says that around 100m people, mostly in the developing world, are
now international migrants. The number of asylum seekers and refugees is
rising most rapidly, and may account for 20 per cent of the total.
Money sent back by migrant workers to their home countries may now total
Dollars 70bn a year, the report suggests - second in value only to the
international oil trade.
The global population, estimated at 5.57bn in 1993, is projected to rise to
6.25bn in the year 2000 and 10bn in 2050. While annual population growth is
estimated at 1.7 per cent worldwide, this conceals a wide disparity, with
Africa's growth rate at 3 per cent and Europe's at only 0.3 per cent.
Age structures are also diverging. In Africa, the number of people under 15
has tripled over the last 40 years, and the proportion has remained around
40 per cent; in Latin America the proportion of under 15s peaked in 1965-70
and has been falling rapidly ever since, while in east Asia the proportion
has dropped to 26 per cent.

A NUMBER of Katyusha rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into northern Israel
early on Tuesday, causing light damage, security sources said, Reuter
reports from Jerusalem.
Rockets landed in Israel's western Galilee and also in Lebanon in Israel's
self-styled buffer security zone for repelling guerrilla attacks. No one was
injured, the sources said, adding that Israeli troops returned fire.
Israeli soldiers had clashed with guerrillas in Lebanon on Monday. Lebanese
security sources said two people, one of them a six-month-old baby, died in
an Israeli retaliatory attack on guerrilla targets in Lebanon.
Israeli residents had braced late on Monday for possible rocket attacks in
response to the clash. Israeli security sources said pro-Iranian guerrillas
ambushed an Israeli patrol earlier on Monday, wounding one soldier on the
edge of the security zone.
Hizbollah fighters also attacked a position held by Israeli-backed
militiamen in Toumat Niha.
Israeli military censors made deletions from this report.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Funds to developing countries rise 23%

FINANCIAL flows to developing countries increased 23 per cent in 1992 to a
record Dollars 176bn (Pounds 117bn) as a result of an explosion in bank
lending, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
With direct investment also rising sharply, private money flows reached
Dollars 99.8bn and exceeded official aid for the first time since 1983, the
OECD's development assistance committee (DAC) said in an annual report.
The panel welcomed the increase, which it said reflected positive economic
and political trends in developing countries.
But it cautioned the boom might not be sustainable and said that, in any
case, only a few better-off developing countries were benefiting from the
sudden interest.
'The ability of the vast number of the poorer developing countries to
attract external resources, particularly private flows, is little changed.
For them, official development finance remains the backbone of resource
provision.'
About half of the rich nations that make up the DAC boosted their official
development assistance in 1992, with Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark and
Italy all reporting big increases.
The US was the biggest donor in money terms, providing Dollars 11.7bn,
followed by Japan with Dollars 11.1bn, France with Dollars 8.3bn and Germany
Dollars 7.6bn.
But for the 21 DAC members as a whole, the volume of aid was unchanged from
1991 at 0.33 per cent of gross national product - well short of the
international target of 0.7 per cent and still below the 0.34 per cent
average recorded between 1979 and 1988.
Among big donors, Japan cut its aid by 5.8 per cent, Britain by 4 per cent
and Germany by 2.1 per cent, the report said.
International bank lending increased to Dollars 40bn from Dollars 11bn.
Short-term lending accounted for more than half the rise.
As a result the total debt burden of developing countries grew 3 per cent in
1992 to Dollars 1,530bn, the OECD said. The cost of servicing the debt was
unchanged at about Dollars 150bn.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Elections 1993: Business backing slips away from ruling
party / Examining growing divisions of interest among the LDP's corporate
donors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE divisions that have split Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party are
working their way through the party's bedrock, its business support.
Traditional LDP supporters in industries such as construction and machinery
regard the recent split in the party's ranks as a disaster.
Mr Takeshi Kaname, managing director of Yamazaki Mazak, the leading machine
tool manufacturer, remarked: 'The divisions are terrible, nothing but bad
news.'
Yet he is far from being in a majority. Business executives from newer
industries such as electronics and cars, which are more dependent on
international trade, say they support political reforms which could
strengthen new parties.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Federation of Employers' Associations,
believes the new parties created by breakaways from the LDP could bring
benefits to business, partly by displacing the Socialist opposition.
Commenting on the Japan Renewal party led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former
finance minister, Mr Nagano said: 'I would like to see the new party become
one wing of a two-party conservative political set up.'
These divisions came to a head last week when the heads of Japan's four
largest employer federations held a hastily convened summit.
They decided to review their relationship with the LDP after the election.
Business may fund the new conservative parties if they emerge from the poll
strong enough to offer a durable alternative to the LDP.
At first sight Japanese industry's interests in fostering a challenge to the
LDP seem perverse. Business has done extremely well from LDP policies over
the past three decades which have been designed to favour it often at the
expense of consumers. For instance, Japan still lacks a basic product
liability laws common in other countries.
Mr Hata's new party is conservative but it claims to champion the rights of
consumers and plans to come to power in coalition with the Socialist
opposition.
Many business leaders believe the LDP's political dominance is an
anachronism inherited from the cold war era when Japanese industry was
developing with the help of the government's protection.
Mr Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Cannon, the camera company, explained: 'The
old relationships are breaking up. In the old days when Japan set out to
catch up with the west it made sense for business to build close
relationships with political parties. But now Japan is an economic
superpower and the cold war threat it gone. We no longer have to contribute
to the LDP to protect the economy.'
Executives from international companies believe Japan's political
institutions are ill-equipped to guide Japan to a larger world role. They
also complained the centralisation of bureaucratic power in Tokyo handicaps
them with unnecessary regulations at home.
A senior official of the Keidanren, the largest employers' federation,
explained: 'Japan needs stronger, more enlivened politics to open debate on
how Japan should fulfil a large international role. We just do not debate
these issues at the moment. We need more political openness.' He went on:
'We want decentralisation at home so that bureaucrats in Tokyo have less
power to set detailed regulations in local areas. If a business wants to do
something - extend a road or build a factory extension - they often have to
apply to Tokyo first. This creates huge bottlenecks.'
The official concluded: 'The development of two competing parties, a
conservative party and a more liberal, consumer-oriented, internationalist
party, is a part of Japan becoming more mature.'
This developing division in politics reflects a similar trend within
industry. The LDP has held together a very wide coalition of business
support stretching from domestic farmers and small businesses, to large
high-technology manufacturing companies exporting 80 per cent of their
output.
It is becoming increasingly hard for the party to satisfy both wings of its
business coalition. Manufacturing exporters' interest in free trade is
increasingly at odds with the protection of rice farmers, for which Japan is
regularly criticised by its trading partners.
Heavy industries such as steel and chemicals, which benefit from traditional
government public building programmes designed to boost the flagging
economy, are at odds with retailers and consumer goods makers who want a tax
cut to revive consumer spending in urban areas.
An imbalance in how industries wield political influence also favours
domestically oriented sectors. Construction companies can target their
financial support at politicians who will influence how public sector
contracts are awarded. However, consumer industries cannot target their
political support in this way.
As a senior executive with a consumer electronics manufacturer explained:
'We need to change general policies such as the retail laws and tax policies
to help our business. That means changing the way politicians in general
think, not just a few key people. That is why we favour more political
debate because that is the only way to get different policies discussed.'
But perhaps the most pressing reason for business reconsidering links with
the LDP is the way the political corruption tarnishes the image of business.
This is already having an impact on the LDP's finances. The party had hoped
to borrow Y25bn (Pounds 155m) from a syndicate of large banks to finance its
election campaign. The banks trimmed that to Y10bn because they did not want
to be seen bankrolling the LDP.
Even the construction industry federation last week adopted tougher
guidelines to limit political donations by member companies.

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government yesterday offered the two civilian political
parties a role in an interim national government in a deal that would
involve dissolving all democratic institutions.
President Ibrahim Babangida proposed the deal as an alternative to holding
fresh elections at the end of July.
This apparent attempt to meet the deadline for ending military rule on
August 27 without confirming the victory of Mr Moshood Abiola of the Social
Democratic party in the June polls may exacerbate the civilian protest
movement which has paralysed most economic activity in Lagos so far this
week. Furthermore, it would not meet conditions for restoring aid suspended
by donor countries last week.
Gen Babangida said he found the two army-created parties, the SDP and the
National Republican Convention (NRC),'polls apart' when they met on Monday
night.
The SDP stood by its rejection of fresh elections by the end of July with
new candidates, which the NRC would support. The senior candidates who were
banned during the previous presidential campaign last October have also
refused to stand again.
The president has given the two parties until tomorrow to consider the
options. If they accept the national government proposal, all the elected
civilian arms of government are likely to be dissolved, including local
councils, state governors and the House of Assembly and the two parties
could also be scrapped.
According to a state radio broadcast yesterday Gen Babangida said the
proposed national government would not include him and he urged the parties
to adopt the plan in the national interest, which was 'to achieve a
termination of the military regime by August 27'. A presidential spokesman
said that the armed forces would have no role in in the government.
The first organised civilian protest against the military government's
manipulation of the electoral system is finding strong support in Lagos.

THREE EXECUTIVES at a leading Japanese construction company, Hazama, were
stripped of their posts yesterday after having been arrested as part of a
public prosecutors' office investigation into the alleged bribery of a
regional mayor.
The dismissal of Hazama's chairman, president and senior managing director
by its board came as fresh controversy arose over requests by Mr Yoshiro
Hayashi, finance minister, to banks for funds to fight a general election on
July 18.
Several business leaders have criticised Mr Hayashi's requests to the banks,
and Mr Tadashi Okuda, the chairman of the federation of bankers'
associations, was forced to defend the industry's separate provision of
Y10bn (Pounds 60.7m) in loans to the LDP election campaign.
Mr Okuda said the loans, from eight commercial banks, were justified as the
LDP was a party that would maintain a 'parliamentary democracy and a free
economy'. However, he warned it would be an abuse of position for Mr Hayashi
to expect increased funding because he had become finance minister.
The requests by Mr Hayashi have been queried by the Keidanren, the
federation of economic organisations, which said they could lead to
'misunderstandings'.
Meanwhile, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives yesterday said
companies should consider a cut in LDP donations to release funds for new
parties. Official donations to the LDP are estimated at Y13bn a year, but
unofficial and illegal donations are thought to be many times that figure.
In the Hazama case, prosecutors continue to question Mr Toru Ishii, mayor of
Sendai, in the north, alleged to have received Y100m from four construction
companies in the expectation they would be hired for public works projects.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Mexico City puts its property money where its slums are:  An
ambitious real estate development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE western outskirts of Mexico City lies Latin America's largest and
most ambitious real estate project. What a few years ago were slums, strip
mines and rubbish dumps are soon to be sparkling corporate offices of some
of Mexico's best-known companies - Televisa, Banca Serfin, Bimbo, and the
subsidiaries of Goodyear, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard and Mercedes-Benz.
The Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn, 2,100-acre Santa Fe project, just outside the
city's most exclusive residential neighbourhoods, is the brainchild of the
Mexico City government. Once the poorest and most dangerous part of Mexico
City, it is now the most striking symbol of what is fast becoming a property
boom in one of the world's largest cities.
After a decade of stagnation, Mexican developers are putting up new office
blocks throughout the city - in the financial district, in the fashionable
western part of the city and in the south, along the ring road.
According to Softec, a consultancy, some 575,892 sq m of top quality 'AAA'
office space is under construction, more than the existing stock of such
space.
The growth has been fuelled by optimism about Mexico's economic prospects
and the shortage of quality space. A sharp reduction in interest rates from
50 per cent or more a few years ago to less than 20 per cent has also
enabled developers to raise the necessary finance. Construction, from
accounting for less than 2 per cent of total bank loans, now represents more
than 8 per cent.
Mr Juan Enriquez Cabot, the city official in charge of the Santa Fe project,
says: 'If we do not change this city from a manufacturing to service centre,
there will not be enough jobs and the informal economy will take over. We
have no option but to grow.' Mexico City needs to create 100,000 jobs a year
just to absorb new entrants into the labour force.
But the boom is already raising fears of a bust, and vacancy rates have
started to climb from about 1.2 per cent in 1991, to 7.6 per cent last year.
'We have passed the peak,' says Dionosio Sanchez, an executive with the Sare
group, one of Mexico's biggest property developers. 'The first thing we are
going to see now is a reduction in prices.'
Since 1988, Mexico City's top quality office rents have risen from an
average of Dollars 20 a sq m to Dollars 40 last year - making them as much
as double as, say, the equivalent in Los Angeles. But Mr Sanchez says rents
have stabilised this year, and expects them to fall by 10 per cent or more
in two years.
With the economy growing by just 2.6 per cent last year - much slower than
optimistic developers hoped - demand has failed to keep up with supply.
'Just about all developers are betting the North American Free Trade
Agreement will be passed,' says Mr Sanchez 'and demand for quality space
will grow.' If the agreement is scuttled, he says, some developers could be
in difficulty.
The Santa Fe project is the largest of the score of office block
developments. Managed by the city government, it has already received some
Dollars 2bn of private-sector investment, and another Dollars 8bn is
expected over the next six to eight years.
By the end of the year stage one will be complete, and Latin America's
largest shopping centre, of some 200,000 sq m, and 10 state-of-the art
corporate offices will be open.
Elsewhere the city has given the green light to five new giant five-star
hotels, including a 55-storey Ritz Carlton hotel and office block that will
be Mexico City's tallest building. The state trade bank is helping to
finance the Dollars 100m refurbishment of the huge but unoccupied World
Trade Centre, which was started in the 1960s to be ready for the 1968
Olympics but was never completed.
The construction boom is not uncontroversial. Mexico City accounts for some
37 per cent of Mexico's gross domestic product and suffers from some of the
world's worst pollution, houses the country's oldest and most inefficient
industrial stock and is running precariously short of water.
Mr Homero Aridjis, a poet and environmentalist who has just written a novel
on the future of Mexico City, says: 'It doesn't matter whether people work
in industries, on the street or in universities, they all pollute. What we
need is decentralisation and a stabilisation of population.'

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chances of concluding a Uruguay Round world trade reform deal are
slipping away because 'nobody is exerting the leadership to force this thing
through,' according to Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm
Bureau, the US agricultural lobby.
Mr Kleckner, in Europe for talks with the EC Commission, French farm
organisations and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade officials in
Geneva, said he had arrived with 'a little better than 50/50' prognosis for
the Round, but was leaving Brussels feeling the odds were now against a
deal.
If the Round failed, he warned, 'we are going to enter a period of trade
wars, Gatt (dispute) panels. . . and more regional and bilateral trade
deals,' in which the US would turn its back on Europe.
Mr Kleckner had been a strenuous lobbyist in the 18 months of negotiations
leading up to last year's EC-US deal on farm trade and oilseeds subsidies,
reached at Blair House in Washington and one of the foundation stones of any
eventual Uruguay Round success.
The oilseeds agreement was ratified by the EC last month, but French
opposition to curbs on subsidised food exports has called into question the
rest of the package, which is part of the Uruguay Round proper.
Mr Kleckner said he won assurances from senior Commission officials that the
EC regarded the deal as indivisible. But he warned that if the Uruguay Round
part of Blair House 'is going to be renegotiated, oilseeds has to be
renegotiated too. We didn't think that was a very good agreement at all.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: EC urges Miyazawa to stimulate growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday pressed Japan to open its public
procurement more to European products and suggested that Japan should cut
income tax to help boost its economy.
At an EC-Japanese summit on the eve of the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations' economic summit in Tokyo, the community delegation said it was
'disappointed' at the efforts made so far by Japan to stimulate economic
growth. It described Japan's Dollars 150bn annual current account surplus as
a 'macro-economic problem for Japan and the world'.
Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC's commissioner for economic and monetary
affairs, said Japan's two economic packages agreed last August and in April
would not be sufficient to raise Japan's growth rate to its potential of 3
to 3.5 per cent a year. He also criticised Japanese growth measures as being
mainly designed to increase demand for domestically produced goods and
services. They would not promote growth elsewhere in the world, he said.
The EC delegation called on Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister,
to urge measures to cut Japan's current account surplus as a share of gross
domestic product from the 3.7 per cent recorded in the second half of last
year. Mr Christophersen said he feared that Japan's surplus could grow
further next year to 4 per cent of GDP.
But the talks, while frank, appeared not to have been acrimonious. Mr
Miyazawa admitted that Japan's current account surplus was embarrassing and
said Japan wanted to increase domestic demand.
However, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said the Japanese
leader gave no specific promise to take action. Mr Miyazawa asked the EC
delegation if it had any ideas that could help, at which point the EC
suggested that Japan cut income taxes.
On one issue, the EC and Japan were united. Sir Leon said the community had
made clear that it did not support the US idea of 'managed trade' to curb
Japan's surpluses.
However, he told a news conference that the community would seek a 'fair
opportunity' to supply goods to Japanese public bodies.
He complained that the US had gained four times more than the EC from
Japanese efforts to open up public procurement to foreign suppliers last
year.
In the months ahead Japan Airlines (JAL) would be seeking engines for its
new Boeing 777 aircraft and Japan's self defence forces would be looking for
new executive jets. The EC expected that its companies would be considered
as suppliers.
However, senior Japanese officials said Japan's public sector was more
willing to buy foreign products than either the US or the EC. They said that
more than 14 per cent of Japanese public procurement went to foreign
suppliers in 1991.
In 1990, according to the latest available figures, EC public bodies bought
less than 2 per cent of their needs from foreign suppliers, while in the US
foreign suppliers met 11.9 per cent of public sector needs, the officials
said.
The officials also said that Japan's bilateral trade surplus with the EC was
declining. It fell 7.6 per cent in the first five months of this year,
compared with the same period a year ago, they said.

FT  07 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: US and Japan seek to break trade deadlock
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS from the US and Japan were last night preparing for two days of
intensive talks in an attempt to break the deadlock over a framework
governing trade between the two countries.
However, US officials played down the prospects of an imminent breakthrough
based upon compromise proposals made late last week by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the Japanese prime minister.
Mr Miyazawa's proposals have breathed new life into the bilateral talks,
which resumed on the eve of this week's Group of Seven economic summit in
Tokyo after stalling 10 days ago. However, the two sides are still sharply
divided. Japan is resisting US calls for Tokyo to accept numerical targets
for increasing imports and reducing Japan's Dollars 50bn current account
surplus with the US over the next three years.
President Bill Clinton, speaking after an hour long meeting with Mr Miyazawa
yesterday afternoon, admitted that the talks were in a critical period and
were not 'free of difficulty'.
Mr Clinton praised Mr Miyazawa for reaching across the gap which divided the
two sides to keep the talks alive. Mr Clinton said: 'We have hopes. I do not
want to raise hopes, but we have hopes.'
Japanese officials said Mr Clinton called Mr Miyazawa's proposals a 'useful
first step'. However, the Japanese proposal falls short of US demands in
crucial areas.
Japan's government says it will stimulate domestic demand to promote growth,
which will contribute to reducing the trade surplus. However, it explicitly
rules out targets to reduce the surplus to between 1 per cent and 2 per cent
of gross national product, which the US has called for.
Tokyo has conceded that it will use quantitative criteria retrospectively to
monitor progress in expanding the foreign share of the Japanese market.
However it has ruled out using these measures as targets to guide policy.
A senior Japanese official said: 'We fear that as soon as we include a
target it will be taken in the US as a commitment on our part to make sure
that it achieved.'
Mr Clinton stressed the US commitment to its often overlooked security
alliance with Japan, as a counterpoint to the tensions over trade. He
emphasised the US would maintain its military engagement in Asia, a theme he
will take up at greater length today in a wide ranging speech at Waseda
University on the US role in Asia.
Mr Clinton took a benign view on the political turmoil in Japan created by
the splits within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party which triggered the
general election on July 18. He said the political upheaval would eventually
benefit Japan by strengthening its democracy.
However, US officials recognise that if they do not strike deal on trade
with Mr Miyazawa's weakened administration in the next few days they may
have to wait weeks if not months before a new Japanese administration is in
place to resume substantive negotiations.

THE WORLD BANK has approved a Dollars 75m credit to 'reactivate' Ecuador's
private sector, particularly agriculture and construction. The aim is to
invest in labour-intensive but profitable industries, said government
officials.
Mr Leonardo Stagg, director of the Ecuadorian National Finance Corporation,
said the Dollars 75m credit was part of a 'Dollars 200m joint loan from the
Inter-American Development Bank, the Andean Corporation for Development and
the World Bank.'
Mr Shahid Husain, World Bank vice president for Latin America and the
Caribbean, said the World Bank was committed to support programmes of
economic growth and development in countries such as Ecuador, which had
engaged in serious and responsible projects.
As well as providing desperately needed funds to revitalise the economy, the
new credit is aimed at boosting confidence among foreign investors.
'This is a clear indication of the confidence that international credit
institutions now have in Ecuador,' emphasised President Sixto Duran Ballen.
The new credit comes as Ecuador is struggling to renegotiate Dollars 6.5bn
in commercial debt with creditor banks.

FT  07 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Major to 'badger and bully' for Gatt progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the UK prime minister, last night promised to 'badger and
bully' to achieve progress on the stalled Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks at this week's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo.
Declaring that growth, unemployment and trade were the 'centrepiece' of the
summit, Mr Major said it was important to make progress on trade this week.
'I very much hope that by the end of the summit, we shall have a market
access agreement opening up markets, lowering tariffs and increasing trade,'
he said.
Shortly after his arrival in Tokyo, the prime minister said he also hoped
the summit could reach agreement to return to the full multilateral trade
talks in Geneva. But 'it won't be easy,' he warned.
Mr Major was speaking as trade ministers from the so-called Quad group -
comprising the US, the EC, Japan and Canada - settled down for talks late
into the night on the hoped-for market access pact designed to lower tariffs
on a wide range of manufactured goods and services. If successful, the Quad
talks could give new impetus to the Uruguay Round.
Mr Major said Britain could quickly reach agreement on the Round but other
countries had difficulties. British officials pointed out that even if
progress was made on the trade talks this week, the outcome would have to be
'multilateralised' and be accepted by the wider Gatt membership.
The prime minister said he would advocate supply side economic policies to
encourage growth in the industrialised world and would push in the G7
meeting for future economic summits to be more simple.
Mr Major said President Bill Clinton had been right to speak of a crisis of
slow growth in the G7. With 23m people out of work in the G7 countries 'the
only thing that is growing fast is unemployment,' he said.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has won an
overwhelming victory in elections for governor of the state of Mexico, the
country's most populous state and formerly a region of opposition strength.
With counting almost completed the PRI had won 57.9 per cent of the vote,
the centre-right Party of National Action 16.5 per cent, and the leftist
Party of Democratic Revolution 8.1 per cent.
Although both opposition parties complained of irregularities, the result is
undoubtedly a blow to the PRD, whose leader, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, has
declared his candidacy in next year's presidential election, when President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari stands down. Mr Cardenas carried the state in the
1988 presidential election, and in the 1990 gubernatorial election the PRD
won 14 per cent of the vote.
The PRI also won a sweeping victory in the election for governor in the
state of Nayarit, obtaining 57.7 per cent of the vote, against 27.5 per cent
for the PRD, with nearly 90 per cent of the vote counted. However, the PRD
managed to win two of the 18 elections for state deputy.
While more peaceful than elections in 1990, the opposition described the
State of Mexico poll as 'unequal, inadequate and anti-democratic'.
Apart from criticising the PRI's heavy spending and control of the electoral
process, the opposition said the ruling party changed voter lists at the
last moment.

<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday formally lodged its bid for a permanent seat on an enlarged
United Nations security council by pledging that it would discharge all the
obligations that this would entail.
Japan's response to the UN on plans to restructure the security council
calls for it to be expanded to about 20 members. In choosing permanent
members the UN should give due weight to the country's political and
economic weight in the world, according to the Japanese.
Tokyo's campaign for a permanent security council seat, which has recently
won the support of the US, may put it at odds with the UK and France.
Japanese officials stressed that the proposal for an expanded UN security
council was intended to avoid disadvantaging existing members.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said the question of Japan's wish for
a seat was one that needed to be taken 'very gently.'
Speaking shortly after his arrival in Tokyo for the Group of Seven summit,
Mr Major said there were 'lots of ramifications,' not least the competing
demands of other countries that would like to be permanent members of the
security council.
Discussions on the issue would last for some time, he predicted.
Japanese officials have taken a low key approach to winning support for
their campaign. Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister, said that Japan wanted
to make the security council more representative while maintaining its
effectiveness in dealing with international disputes.
He said Japan wanted the restructuring of the security council to coincide
with the United Nation's 50th anniversary in 1995.
Japan's claim to be ready to deal with the crises the security council
addresses was undermined by it missing the deadline for responses to the UN
consultation paper on the council's future. This was because different arms
of the bureaucracy were at odds over how many seats the expanded council
should have.

FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Nafta jitters cut US-Mexican trade
imbalance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE uncertainty over passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement
through the US Congress has led to a narrowing of the US trade surplus with
Mexico and a fall-off in US exports to its southern neighbour, economists
say.
The so-called 'Nafta jitters' may prove the Clinton administration's
argument that a strong Mexico is a better market for US exports, they add.
In April, the last month for which the US Commerce Department has figures,
the US trade surplus with Mexico fell to Dollars 264m (Pounds 176m), from
Dollars 299m in March and Dollars 591m in March 1992. US exports to Mexico
in April dropped from Dollars 3.7bn to Dollars 3.6bn.
According to an analysis produced by First Chicago Bank, the tightening in
Mexican monetary policy, which began about 14 months ago, has eased demand
for imported goods, 'while the fitful recovery in the US is increasing the
demand for Mexican exports'.
Since December the rate of growth of Mexican exports to the US had been
higher than imports - for the first time since March 1990, said First
Chicago.
A Mexican official said: 'When people are ready to jump the ship because of
Nafta, because of a worry about devaluation, the government is forced to
tighten the ship.' Interest rates have risen to more than 15 per cent,
depressing demand.
'The rate of growth in Mexico is slowing,' said Mr Chip Brown, an economist
with Salomon Brothers. 'The slowdown in the Mexican economy means slower
demand for US products.'
The Clinton administration has been arguing - without much success - that
200,000 American jobs gained in the past few years would be lost if Nafta
failed. Most US voters are sceptical of such claims; they are more conscious
of jobs lost when factories shut down to relocate in Mexico.
According to First Chicago the current trade trends will be sustained by
continued slow growth in Mexico and economic recovery in the US.

MEXICO is expected to open up its financial sector to European financial

Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the UK Treasury, said yesterday in
Mexico City that he believed some direct access would be given if quotas set
aside for US and Canadian houses were insufficient for European banks to
compete. Mr Portillo met President Carlos Salinas in an attempt to increase
awareness of opportunities in Mexico for British businessmen.

PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, Alcatel of France and AT&amp;T of
the US have won a Dollars 53m (Pounds 35.3m) contract for more than 600km of
underwater fibre optic cable for an ambitious communications scheme in South
America.
When completed, the new Unisur network will link Brazil to Uruguay and
Argentina, greatly improving voice and data links in the southern cone of
Latin America.
Unisur's four new fibre optic cables will eventually be able to carry up to
80,000 simultaneous telephone conversations. Unisur comprises 25
international telecoms carriers, including companies from Latin America, the
US, Italy and Spain. Once connected with the existing Americas-1 fibre optic
network, subscribers will gain a direct fibre optic telecoms link stretching
from southern Latin America along the Brazilian coast to the Caribbean and
North America.
The link will also allow Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina to hook up with
another new fibre optic network, Columbus II, providing a continuous fibre
optic connection under the Atlantic to Europe.

FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: China on a wing and a prayer - A Hong Kong
investor's move to mainland / Foreign Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I WENT to have a look, and there I was standing knee deep in a paddy field
talking to the village headman who boasted that his was the best village in
China.' On the strength of that, Mr Patrick Wang, managing director of
Johnson Electric, one of the world's leading manufacturers of micro-motors,
made the most important decision in his company's life.
The year was 1982 and the place Shajing, a small rural village in Guangdong
prefecture north of Shenzhen.
Today in Shajing - which has been transformed from a sleepy rural community
to a light industrial town - Johnson produces 90 per cent of its output of
micro-motors - motors for electric windows in Volkswagen, General Motors and
Chrysler cars and a host of household appliances and power tools.
In the space of a decade the Hong Kong-based Johnson has gone from employing
a few hundred to 7,000 workers at its Shajing factories. Mr Wang reckons
that his prices would have had to be 30 per cent higher if he had stayed in
Hong Kong and if he could have found the people to hire - a big if.
He says his investment in China has been paid back 'many times over', and
points to Johnson's post-tax return on investment of 20 per cent over the
past few years. However, investing in Shajing has not been trouble-free.
'We had problems at different stages,' Mr Wang says. 'Initially electricity
was not a problem, but as more factories set up in Shajing it became one.
There was rationing; so we put in our own power plant. Water was also
problem. We were forced to dig our own wells and when they ran dry - because
the water table had fallen - we had to dig deeper.'
The explosive growth in industrial activity also took its toll on the
workforce. Today, Mr Wang says, most of Johnson's original employees, having
got rich, have moved elsewhere. The workforce now comes from China's
interior and that means having to house them.
For most of Johnson's decade in southern China the output of its factories
has been destined for foreign markets. This will change after two
joint-venture companies it has established begin to turn their attention to
the domestic Chinese market.
Mr Wang finds himself facing challenges many foreign businessmen meet when
trying to sell into the Chinese market. For him, two things stand out:
understanding the value of guanxi (connections) and knowing the local
language and, if possible, more than one dialect.
'Connections are always useful in China,' he says. 'One gets a lot more
information if you know the right people. Access to information is
explicitly linked to guanxi networks. Information is held within the network
and exploited for profit.
'There will be crackdowns on corruption, but China is China. It's not too
different from the way Taiwan was. But it is not something that is out of
hand, with no regard to the overall economics of a venture, like it is in
Indonesia.'
Developing a network is something to which Mr Wang is devoting considerable
time. 'I attend shows and technical seminars, use referrals and word of
mouth. Also a lot of our customers - such as Volkswagen, General Motors and
Chrysler - have operations in China and we can sell to them. You have got to
use whatever you have.'
He believes that for a western company, cracking the Chinese market is
difficult. 'You cannot depend on finding management or administrators in
China - they do not exist,' he says. 'Western companies will have to
identify managers in their companies who represent the core values of the
organisation. If they decided the China market is crucial to them they then
have to send them to live in China.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Mercury to start in-flight phone lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY Communications, a subsidiary of the UK's Cable and Wireless group,
plans to launch what it claims is Europe's first 'air-to-ground' telephone
service later this year.
If the service is taken up by airlines, it will offer air travellers
telephone, fax and a range of value-added services like electronic games and
in-flight shopping, using base-stations and satellites to provide the
necessary links to land-based networks.
The service is to be provided by a joint venture company called In-Flight
Phone Europe, bringing together Mercury, In-Flight Phone International, a
company providing a similar service in the US, and Irelandia, a private
investment group.
Travellers will access the digital network through a telephone handset in
the arm-rest of their seat, selecting services from a viewing screen on the
headrest of the seat in front of them.
Rates for telephone calls will start at Pounds 2 a minute for
non-international calls, charged automatically to a credit card.
The initial cost of establishing the network, which will require 60
terrestrial ground stations to provide a complete service, is believed to be
around Pounds 10m. In-Flight Phone International said it had invested
Dollars 80m (Pounds 53.3m) in its similar US system, which is in the process
of being installed in 400 planes operated by USAir.
Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said: 'the ability to make calls
and receive messages in the air marks a significant breakthrough in
communications for all European passengers.'
The first phase of the network construction is expected to be finished by
the end of this year, with all the ground stations in place by 1995. The
equipment will be compatible with both European and North American standards
and frequencies.
With telecommunications companies seeking to maximise revenue from
value-added services, innovative products like In-Flight Phone, produced in
partnership with niche companies, look set to become increasingly common.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Export Credits Guarantee Department, the UK's official export credit
insurer, has resumed medium-term cover for Poland after an 11-year lapse
which followed Poland's partial default on its foreign debt in 1982, writes
Anthony Robinson.
Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, said cover would be available on
standard OECD terms to support exports of capital goods, semi-capital goods
and services to Poland.
Resumption of ECGD cover, designed to improve UK exporters' opportunities in
the Polish market, reflects Poland's successful re-negotiation of its
Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22bn) debt to the Paris Club of official creditors in
1991.
Polish-UK trade has grown over the past two years but has been held back by
bank financing difficulties and the lack of EGCD cover. In 1992 UK exports,
boosted by rising oil sales, increased to Pounds 605m from Pounds 347 in
1991 while Polish exports to the UK rose from Pounds 313m in 1991 to Pounds
356m last year. The first quarter of 1993 showed gains, with UK exports up
65 per cent to Pounds 170m while imports from Poland rose 20 per cent to
Pounds 101m.

MALAYSIAN Resources Corporation (MRCB) disclosed late yesterday plans to
take over a proposed MDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 899m) power-station project and
acquire a listed vehicle for the power venture, AP-DJ reports from Kuala
Lumpur.
The announcement came a week after the company completed MDollars 800m in
acquisitions that gave it control of two national media groups.
The transactions will transform MRCB into the nation's largest independent
electricity producer, fleshing out the company's speedy metamorphosis from a
small property concern to a diverse group.
It is controlled by parties allied with Mr Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, finance
minister, with equity interests in two planned electricity projects and
controling stakes in Malaysia's largest print media group and only private
television broadcaster.
But MRCB's rapid ascension has left it saddled with a cumbersome debt
burden.
Analysts said they saw the latest power-related proposals adding to the
burden while offering no immediate return.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission will today renew pressure on Italy to fall in line
with Community plans to restructure the ailing EC steel industry.
Concern is growing in Brussels that Italy's reluctance to amend its plans to
restructure Ilva, the state steel producer, could derail EC steel policy. To
try to force Italy's hand, the Commission is likely to open a formal
procedure today to recover state subsidies allegedly being pumped into Ilva.
Commissioners will also debate proposals intended to stop the Italian state
continuing to finance Ilva's losses, which one Brussels official estimated
yesterday at Ecu150m (Pounds 116m) a month.
The Italian government says Ilva is not receiving state aid as such and
refuses to make the capacity cuts which Brussels is demanding in return for
the subsidies.
Brussels is already blaming Italian stubbornness - in particular, Ilva's
alleged attempts to block an independent study of the company - for the
probable postponement of this month's crucial meeting of EC industry
ministers. That meeting was supposed to decide on a handful of highly
sensitive state aid cases in Spain, east Germany and Italy. It would lay the
ground for formal agreement on a wide-ranging overall plan for capacity
cuts.

FT  07 JUL 93 / The infection deep inside Italy's health ministry: Haig
Simonian dissects the latest stream of corruption revelations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stream of revelations about corruption in Italy's ministry of health
suggests health was at least as lucrative an activity for Italian
politicians as telephones and transport - two of the main areas of
corruption revealed so far.
The investigations have triggered the arrest of a string of leading
executives from the pharmaceuticals, advertising and public relations
sectors. They have tarnished the reputations of some of Italy's top medical
men and already caused one probable suicide.
At the root of the investigations are Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former
health minister, who resigned in February after being accused of running a
jobs-for-votes scam in his native Naples, and Mr Giovanni Marone, his
ex-secretary. Mr De Lorenzo has pleaded innocence. Mr Marone, arrested
earlier this year, has sung like a bird.
His testimony has cut a swathe through the medical establishment.
Those arrested include Mr Ambrogio Secondi and Mr Cristiano Steigler,
chairman and managing director of the Italian subsidiary of SmithKline
Beecham, the multinational pharmaceuticals group, and Mr Giampaolo
Zambeletti, former owner of a leading independent pharmaceuticals company.
He is accused of making illegal contributions to political parties, and
allegedly paid L600m (Pounds 235,750) to an advertising agency for
fictitious services. The money in fact went to finance the election campaign
of the small Liberal party, of which Mr De Lorenzo is a leading member.
Mr Secondi and Mr Steigler have been accused of giving Mr Marone L600m to
speed up approval procedures and influence pricing policy.
This week, the plot thickened with the arrest of Mr Elio Guido Rondanelli,
one of Italy's best-known medical academics, and the issue of cautionary
warrants against Mr Duilio Poggiolini and Mr Francesco Antonio Manzoli, two
leading medical academics closely linked with the health ministry.
All three men sat on Italy's independent pharmaceuticals pricing advisory
committee, which reports directly to the ministry on the sensitive issue of
drug prices. According to the magistrates' allegations, some committee
members received kickbacks from drugs companies to influence their
decisions. Last month one committee member, Mr Antonio Vittoria, chairman of
the pharmacy faculty at Naples University, committed suicide.
However, the allegations about the health ministry go much further than
drugs, reflecting the fact that its edict covers a range of other, less
obvious sources, of patronage.
Last week, police arrested Mr Carlo Violati, former chairman of the
Ferrarelle mineral water company, on charges of making illegal political
contributions. Mr Violati allegedly paid L200m to Mr Marone to speed up
analytical work by the ministry.
Italy is the world's biggest mineral water market, and brands compete
fiercely on a variety of factors, including the 'healthiness' of their
products.
The allegations against Mr Violati has already led to suggestions that other
entrepreneurs may also have sought to accelerate the ministry's activities.
The investigations into the ministry have also broken new ground in that
they for the first time in the corruption scandal involve third parties,
such as advertising agencies and big PR companies.
According to Mr Italo Ghitti, one of the Milanese magistrates closely
involved in the investigations: 'Not only did some agencies pay kickbacks,
but they also lent themselves as channels for kickbacks to be paid.'
Magistrates yesterday arrested Mr Claudio Masi de Vargas Macciucca, managing
director in Italy of the FCB Mac/Publicis advertising agency. The arrest
followed the detention last month of Mr Alessandro Incecchi, a former
managing director of the Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agency in Italy, and Mr
Marcello Di Tondo, an executive of the Burston Marsteller group.
Mr Di Tondo's arrest is believed to concern allegations over the health
ministry's big anti-Aids campaign - the same issue that prompted the arrest
last month of Mr Aldo Brancher, an executive of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest media group. Mr Brancher, a lobbyist for Fininvest and assistant
to Mr Fedele Confalonieri, its managing director, allegedly paid Mr Marone
L300m in kickbacks on a television advertising contract during the anti-Aids
campaign.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Mini-budget wins vote of confidence in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi last night won by a large majority
a vote of confidence in the chamber of deputies endorsing the L12,500bn
(Pounds 5.4bn) mini-budget unveiled on May 21, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
Of the 522 deputies present, 311 voted for the government, 98 abstained and
113 voted against. This was the first time since taking office last May that
the former governor of the Bank of Italy has sought a vote of confidence.
He received the backing of the four partners in the coalition formally
supporting his largely technocratic government. But in addition to the
Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals, he won
support from the Republicans and Mr Marco Panella's Radicals.
Mr Ciampi, in Tokyo for the G7 summit, resorted to a vote to prevent
approval of the mini-budget from dragging on and thus interfering with
preparation of next year's budget. There were still some 130 amendments
pending, mainly tabled by the two most vociferous opposition groups: the
Lombard League and Reconstructed Communism.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Jobless total up again in west Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE unemployment rate in western Germany edged up to 7 per cent last month
as recession continued to plague the economy and the summer lull took its
toll. This compared with 6.9 per cent in May and 5.6 in June last year.
People drawing benefit rose by an unadjusted 18,300 to 2.17m. Seasonally
adjusted the increase was close to 30,000. But the official jobless total
was also reduced by tighter controls on registration.
While some 315,000 people were newly registered as unemployed during the
month, a further 297,000 'ended their unemployment', according to an
official statement. However, vacancies were down 8 per cent on June last
year.
Separate figures from the Federal Labour Office showed that in May 482,000
(1.7 per cent) fewer people were in work in the west than in the same month
last year.
Pressures on the labour market were also illustrated by a reduction in new
apprenticeships from almost 44,000 in June last year to 24,000.
Meanwhile, numbers working short-time in the region during June fell 41,500
to around 897,000. There was also a modest increase in joblessness in the
east, where the rate was unchanged on the month at 14.4 per cent, although
slightly down on the 14.7 per cent recorded in June last year.
Although there are some signs that the recession is bottoming out,
unemployment is expected to continue increasing as industrial employers slim
down their operations to restore lost competitiveness.
Diesel engine and plant maker Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, for example,
yesterday announced that a further 2,000 jobs would have to go.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Machine tool body proposes policy for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission will shortly begin a new round of talks which could
lead to Europe's first formal industrial policy for the fragmented and
recession-torn mechanical engineering industry.
Mr Alexander Schaub, deputy director general of its DG III division,
confirmed yesterday that he had received a proposal paper from Cecimo, the
umbrella body for 12 European machine tool associations, on a possible
industrial policy for machine tools.
The unpublished document, obtained by the FT, is part of a much wider
proposal being prepared by Orgalime, liaison group for the European
mechanical, electrical, electronic and metalworking industries, for an EC
industrial policy covering the entire mechanical engineering sector.
The industry believes such a policy could be vital in helping it counter
foreign competition more effectively.
According to Cecimo, the machine tool industry is facing heavy competition
mainly from Pacific Rim countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan
because of its strategic position at the core of all key manufacturing
industries.
'Without a firm industrial and trade policy, there is a risk that, in the
future, Japan could decide what type and how European cars should be built.'
Among its proposals are:
raising ceilings on company size in last year's EC guidelines on state aid
for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), so more machine tool builders
can benefit;
introducing measures to stimulate investment by SMEs in medium and
high-technology capital goods;
early adoption of the European company statute, to create the legal
environment for establishing companies of an optimum size;
clarification of overlapping EC directives affecting the machine tool
sector.
Mr Schaub said he hoped a decision would be made by the end of this year on
whether to prepare a formal communication on industrial policy for
mechanical engineering.
Any communication, however, would be based on the EC's 'horizontal' rather
than sectoral approach to industrial policy. Failing that, the talks would
at least clarify what help the sector could reasonably expect from the EC.
Cecimo was already concerned about the effects of the recession in early
1992 when it presented an initial document listing the industry's problems
to Mr Schaub.
Since then, conditions have worsened. Employment in the Cecimo countries,
which include Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden, fell 12 per cent last year
to 166,000, excluding eastern Germany. Its latest document says there are
some 1,500 European machine tool producers employing an average 125 people
each.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Attali set to get Pounds 147,000 payoff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali, who is resigning as president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, is likely to receive a tax-free payoff of
more than Pounds 147,000.
Mrs Anne Wibble, chairman of the bank's governors who was in London
yesterday to discuss Mr Attali's compensation arrangements and procedures
for finding his successor, said she expected Mr Attali to receive a year's
salary as an allowance for termination of employment.
Mr Attali's letter of appointment says his 'annual net base salary' is
Pounds 147,000. Mr Attali has had a pay rise since then. 'It seems clear it
(the payoff) will be paid,' she said.
Mr Attali resigned on June 25, following months of criticism of expenditure
by the bank.
Mr Attali's letter of appointment says he is entitled to 'a termination
allowance equivalent to one year's net base salary' unless the bank's
governors terminate his contract 'for cause'.
Mrs Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, said a decision on whether to pay Mr
Attali the termination allowance would therefore depend on the outcome of
the investigation into alleged overspending at the bank.
She said Mr Attali would remain at the bank until a new president arrived,
which she hoped could be in September. Governors, representing the
governments of 54 countries and agencies which own the bank, have until July
21 to nominate candidates and the election period lasts 21 days from then.
Bank executives and directors believe that Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor
of the Bank of France, will succeed Mr Attali.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Le Pen visit ends in transit lounge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST he landed this time. Repelled by the hoteliers and local
authorities of Dublin and Edinburgh, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, beacon of
Europe's far right, arrived on British soil yesterday - to spend an hour in
a dingy Heathrow office defending himself against accusations of fascism and
profligacy.
He then flew on to Rome - a city where Mr Le Pen, mentioning Mussolini, said
he was 'always welcome and courteously received.'
This was in contrast to the reception his plans to attend meetings in Dublin
and Edinburgh met this week. Hotels, anxious to avoid demonstrations,
bounced his bookings and Edinburgh council called his proposed visit 'an
affront to the people of Edinburgh.'
Airport police yesterday forced Mr Le Pen to confine his visit to the
British Isles to a suffocating conference room between Terminals One and
Two.
Inside, Mr Le Pen contended with hostile questioning about his views and the
serial junketing that took him to a 5-star hotel in Corfu a fortnight ago
and raised questions in the European Parliament about the abuse of public
funds. Mr Le Pen produced figures which he claimed showed his accounts were
clean.
He said the treatment he had received in Edinburgh and Dublin was 'a defeat
for the European Parliament, a defeat for democracy and a defeat for
international courtesy, but not a defeat for us.' As an MEP he held
diplomatic status and should be able to travel freely throughout Europe.
Anti-fascist groups would not prevent him from visiting (or trying to visit)
one EC country a month, he said.
Having dealt with hospitality hiccups, he moved on to the issue of
immigration. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, was a 'dinosaur' whose
new laws would be hopeless to prevent a 'torrent migratoire.'

FT  07 JUL 93 / The infection deep inside Italy's health ministry: Haig
Simonian dissects the latest stream of corruption revelations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stream of revelations about corruption in Italy's ministry of health
suggests health was at least as lucrative an activity for Italian
politicians as telephones and transport - two of the main areas of
corruption revealed so far.
The investigations have triggered the arrest of a string of leading
executives from the pharmaceuticals, advertising and public relations
sectors. They have tarnished the reputations of some of Italy's top medical
men and already caused one probable suicide.
At the root of the investigations are Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former
health minister, who resigned in February after being accused of running a
jobs-for-votes scam in his native Naples, and Mr Giovanni Marone, his
ex-secretary. Mr De Lorenzo, for whom magistrates have asked that his
parliamentary immunity be lifted, has pleaded innocence. Mr Marone, arrested
earlier this year, has sung like a bird.
So far, his testimony, widely leaked by magistrates, has cut a swathe
through the medical and pharmaceuticals establishment, taking a good swipe
at advertising and PR on the way. The impact of the allegations is that the
ministry and some of its top officials were open to financial incentives for
a variety of favours.
Magistrates have arrested Mr Ambrogio Secondi and Mr Cristiano Steigler,
chairman and managing director of the Italian subsidiary of SmithKline
Beecham, the multinational pharmaceuticals group.
Other arrests include Mr Giampaolo Zambeletti, the former owner and managing
director of one of Italy's leading independent pharmaceuticals companies,
and Mr Claudio Cavazza, chairman of Sigma Tau, another leading independent
pharmaceuticals group.
Mr Secondi is also chairman of the industry association, while Mr Cavazza is
a former chairman.
The latest arrests take to double figures the number of leading drug company
executives arrested in the past fortnight. Others include Mr Andrea
Montececchi of Schiapparelli and Mr Paolo Raimondo of Zambon.
Mr Zambeletti, accused of making illegal contributions to political parties,
allegedly paid L600m (Pounds 235,750) to an advertising agency for
fictitious services. The money in fact went to finance the election campaign
of the small Liberal party, of which Mr De Lorenzo is a leading member.
Mr Secondi and Mr Steigler have also been arrested regarding allegedly
illegal contributions. They are accused of giving Mr Marone L600m to a speed
up approval procedures and influence pricing policy.
This week, the plot thickened with the arrest of Mr Elio Guido Rondanelli,

All three men also sat on Italy's independent pharmaceuticals pricing
advisory committee, which reports directly to the ministry on the sensitive
issue of drug prices. According to the magistrates' allegations, some
committee members received kickbacks from drugs companies to influence their
decisions. Last month, a morbid twist was added to the tale with the
mysterious death, believed to be suicide, in Naples of Mr Antonio Vittoria,
chairman of the pharmacy faculty at Naples university and a committee
member.
However, the allegations about the health ministry go much further than

obvious sources, of patronage.
Last week, police arrested Mr Carlo Violati, the former chairman of the

kickbacks on a television advertising contract during the anti-Aids
campaign. According to normally reliable leaked testimony, Mr Brancher, who
is still in jail, has claimed he was acting in a private capacity on behalf
of his own company rather than Fininvest.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Irish out of luck in EC aid row: Brussels to reject Dublin's
insistence on extra funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE row sparked by Ireland's blocking at the weekend of the European
Community's largest ever regional aid programme looks set to worsen today,
as signs emerge that Brussels may not even be able to guarantee Dublin the
funding that the Irish government has already rejected.
The European Commission and EC ambassadors to Brussels hold separate
meetings today to try to break the logjam, caused by Ireland's refusal to
accept less than the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) that Prime Minister Albert
Reynolds says he was promised at last December's Edinburgh summit.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is understood to have offered the
Irish IPounds 7.5bn last weekend, when EC foreign ministers tried to agree
on the Community's Ecu157bn (Pounds 121bn) regional aid programme for 1994
to 1999.
But the Commission is divided on whether Ireland has been offered more than
it is entitled to under the criteria set at Edinburgh. Spain, Portugal and
Greece - which with Ireland make up the 'Cohesion Four' member states
earmarked for the EC's most generous grants - are objecting that some of the
money already offered to Dublin will have to come out of their pot.
'There's a limit to the number of times you can hand out the same money,'
one EC diplomat said.
Mr Bruce Millan, the Scottish commissioner for regional policy, is insisting
on sticking to the Edinburgh criteria. These weigh factors like regional per
capita income, unemployment levels, size of population and of rural
population. In the 1989-1993 regional aid package, Ireland got 13.5 per cent
of funds for the 'Cohesion Four' - giving it 2 to 2 1/2 times more per
capita than its poor colleagues - whereas now it is being offered an 11 per
cent share.
'On the most generous interpretation of Edinburgh,' one senior EC official
said, 'you just about arrive at IPounds 7bn for Ireland. Even IPounds 7bn
would leave Ireland measurably in front of the other three' on funding per
head. 'There's only so much we can do to get (Mr Reynolds) out of a hole
he's dug for himself.'
An ambassador from one of the 'Cohesion Four' said the three others were not
ready to be flexible. It was not reasonable for anybody to offer something
which differs substantially from what was approved by the Edinburgh summit.
If the package is not wrapped up this week for delivery to the European
Parliament next week, funding is unlikely to start next January.
It is understood, however, that Mr Reynolds' government is examining ways of
dressing up the offer to Ireland, by trying to squeeze more money out of
Community regional funding and out from unspent 1989-1993 aid funds.

<TEXT>
THE Azerbaijan government has sent troops and tanks to the front-line town
of Agdam on the border of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in a
desperate bid to stop the advancing Karabakh Armenian forces from taking it.
The regional centre's fall would be a severe blow for the new government of
Mr Gaidar Aliyev, the former Communist party first secretary who is now
acting head of state.
The Azeri defence ministry said yesterday that as many as 2,500 soldiers had
been sent to the front on Sunday and Monday with about 20 tanks. It claimed
some villages around the town, captured and burnt by the Armenian forces
over the weekend, had been re-taken. However, eyewitnesses in Agdam said
there were fewer than 2,500 fresh troops and there was no indication the
siege of the town had been lifted.
Unconfirmed reports also pointed to the presence in Agdam of Mr Suret
Husseinov, the new Azeri prime minister and former commander of the Azeri
counter-offensive in Karabakh last year. It was his threat last month to
march on the capital, Baku, with soldiers loyal to him that caused the
downfall of President Abulfaz Elchibey and the return to power of Mr Aliyev
 -as well as his own elevation.

SERBIAN opposition leaders were meeting last night to decide whether to call
mass protests in Belgrade after the supreme court rejected an international
appeal to release the ailing opposition figure, Mr Vuk Draskovic.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia yesterday ignored a plea from Mrs
Danielle Mitterrand, the French president's wife, to release Mr Draskovic
who last week began a hunger strike in protest against his imprisonment. Mr
Draskovic and his wife were arrested and severely beaten at a demonstration
in Belgrade last month at which a policeman and a protester were killed.
'He (Milosevic). . . . did not conceal his displeasure at having to see
her,' said a member of the Serbian delegation who attended the one-hour
meeting. Mr Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Serbia's ruling Socialists, dismissed
as 'cynical' the intervention of Mrs Mitterrand 'while Serbia was in a
dungeon'.
Leaders of the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), Serbia's biggest opposition
party, held closed-door meetings after hospital doctors said Mr Draskovic's
condition had 'deteriorated'.
Diplomats in Belgrade yesterday said the 'arrogance' of Mr Milosevic could
backfire and prompt unrest in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. 'People may
take to the streets. The prognosis on Vuk is so bad. The supreme court has
basically said it works for the regime.'
Meanwhile, Serb and Croat commanders at the last minute pulled out of talks
with the commander of the Bosnian army which were to have been held
yesterday at Sarajevo airport on the establishment of a ceasefire and the
safe havens issue.
Reports from all three sides said fighting continued yesterday in north,
central and southeast Bosnia.
In the southwestern city of Mostar, Bosnian radio said Croat forces fired on
the 16th century Ottoman bridge, which is a UN landmark and the symbol of
the battered city.
Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio said Serb forces in Brcko in north Bosnia
brought in reinforcements after suffering heavy losses in fighting with
Moslems.
The UN said many key roads were blocked in central Bosnia where Moslems and
Croats, allies against Serbs earlier in the war, are fighting for territory.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Mini-budget a mega-event for Hungary: Parliament votes today
on a package vital to government finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S conservative government is set to force through parliament today
an emergency budget as unpopular as it is essential to bring wayward
government finances into line.
The vote is a crucial test of the parliamentary majority commanded by Mr
Jozsef Antall, prime minister, in the wake of recent defections from his
Hungarian Democratic Forum. Extreme nationalists led by Mr Istvan Csurka
have broken away to form the far-right Hungarian Justice party, and
restlessness among the Forum's two coalition allies has even led to
speculation that the government could - like the Polish government - fall
over the fiscal measures.
But none of the three conservative coalition parties is ready to fight an
election and the controversial proposal to increase VAT on food and other
staples from 6 to 10 per cent is now expected to pass today's vote, giving
the government a breathing space until autumn and possibly until elections
slated for next May.
The budget package aims to bring down the public sector deficit from last
year's 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.8 per cent this year and
5.6 in 1994. But slippage is likely. Past budget forecasts have been
notoriously over-optimistic, while social security has recently come under
partial control of the ex-Communist unions who want pensions to catch up
with inflation.
Officials expect, however, that package will be approved and make possible a
new accord with the International Monetary Fund, which suspended credits
when Hungary's budget deficit careered through agreed parameters in
mid-1992.
Agreement with the IMF would allow Hungary to take up Dollars 700m in IMF
facilities over 18 months and clear the way for World Bank credits to help
restructure the most indebted companies and recapitalise the largest
commercial banks after massive loan losses.
With so much riding on the mini-budget, Mr Ivan Szabo, finance minister,
says: 'If parliament rejects this, we might as well put up the shutters.'
While the package may satisfy the IMF, it will not by itself right Hungary's
public finances. Underlying the budget deficit is a 19 per cent decline in
GDP between 1989 and 1992, and further stabilisation of government finances
must await economic recovery.
But Hungary's recession is in some respects only now impacting on the
budget. Falling profits at the state utilities have induced the government
to opt for a form of privatisation which lowers expectations of direct sales
proceeds.
The devastating impact of last year's bankruptcy laws on the capital
strength of financial institutions is also only now becoming clear. Tax
revenue from them was formerly a budget mainstay but this year the
government plans to inject about Ft100bn (Pounds 720m) into the troubled
banks in special bonds and in future the budget will have to service the
debt.
Most of all, however, the budget outlook depends on the timing of recovery.
The government earlier predicted a rebound of 0-3 per cent. But the finance
ministry now expects a decline of the same order. The main reason is
recession in Germany and Austria, Hungary's two main trading partners. First
quarter exports to developed countries dropped 30.5 per cent compared with
1992 and domestic demand cannot compensate.
Mr Almos Kovacs, deputy state secretary at the Finance Ministry, says
bluntly: 'For Hungary, growth without exports is impossible.' This leaves
Hungary and its budget drafters, like everyone else in Europe, waiting for
the Bundesbank.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Row looms over proposed limit on trial by jury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last night appeared to be heading for confrontation with
senior members of the judiciary and the legal profession after the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice recommended abolition of a defendant's right
to trial by jury.
This was the most controversial proposal among 352 recommendations for
change in criminal justice made by the commission yesterday and seems
certain to cause a political storm if accepted by the government.
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, had argued strongly
for the change to save costs by cutting down on the number of cases tried at
crown courts.
Most of the 30,000 defendants who elect to be tried by jury each year change
their pleas to guilty at the crown court, resulting in wasted court time and
resources.
The Lord Chief Justice and other senior judges are opposed to abolition of a
right which stretches back to Magna Carta. Lord Taylor is expected to re-
affirm his opposition to the proposal when he addresses the annual Lord
Mayor's dinner for judges tonight.
Last night, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the recommendation
was 'very controversial', adding that he would not 'rush into a snap
judgment on it'.
The proposed curb on jury trials, combined with recommendations for the
introduction of discounts in sentences for early guilty pleas and a
requirement on defendants to disclose their case to the prosecution before
trial, seen as an attack on the right to silence, led lawyers to suggest the
commission had been more concerned with efficiency than justice.
But the commission, which was set up in March 1991 after a series of
miscarriages of justice rocked public confidence in the criminal justice
system, also made several recommendations to prevent further miscarriages of
justice. These were broadly welcomed by the police and the legal profession.
The commission, chaired by Lord Runciman, calls for:
an independent review authority to investigate alleged miscarriages of
justice and refer cases back to the Court of Appeal;
an independent forensic science advisory council to oversee standards;
maintenance of a suspect's right to silence; introduction of continuous
video recording of police custody suites and interrogations;
judges in exceptional cases to order selection of a jury containing up to
three people from ethnic minority communities;
judges to warn juries of dangers of convicting on the basis of confession
evidence alone, but no requirement for confessions to be supported by other
evidence.

FT  07 JUL 93 / KIO's missing cash used in slush fund, say ex-officials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER OFFICIALS of the Kuwait Investment Office have claimed that a slush
fund was created in London in the autumn of 1990 to influence national
political leaders in countries which eventually came to Kuwait's rescue
after Iraq invaded the Gulf emirate.
The former officials claim that some Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) which went
missing shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait from the KIO's Spanish
operation was used to buy political support in the west and the Arab world
in favour of armed intervention to liberate the emirate.
According to confidential evidence submitted to Kuwaiti investigators
looking into the collapse of the KIO in Spain, substantial sums are also
alleged to have been used to buy votes at the United Nations where crucial
Security Council votes later provided the legal basis for Kuwait's
liberation led by troops from the US, Britain, its European partners and
Arab states.
Members of the KIO's former management, some of whom are accused by the Gulf
emirate of stealing between Dollars 300m and Dollars 510m, have persistently
claimed that the missing funds were used to influence political opinion on
the instruction of Kuwaiti leaders in exile.
France was specifically mentioned as being targeted in the propaganda
campaign, as well Tunisia and Morocco.
Both the Kuwaiti government and the present management of the KIO deny the
existence of such a political slush fund.
However, in the first official reference to the possible existence of a
London-based slush fund, a Kuwaiti parliamentary committee investigating
alleged losses of up to Dollars 5bn from the KIO's Spanish operations, has
been told its ex-chairman, Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al-Sabah, transferred
Dollars 300m from Spain to accounts under his control in London soon after
the invasion.
The report by the parliament's finance committee quotes Mr David Betts, KIO
chief financial officer, as telling it last February: 'The former president
of the Office (the KIO), Fahad Mohammed al-Sabah, asked him not to mention
anything about the transfers made from Grupo Torras in Spain to his account
in London and which amounted to Dollars 300m in 1990. He justified the
secrecy by saying that these sums were confidential and were transferred for
political purposes. He (Sheikh Fahad) repeated this on several occasions.'
Grupo Torras is the KIO's crippled Spanish industrial company. Some Dollars
1.2bn was transferred to Torras by the KIO from London between August and
October 1990 of which up to Dollars 510m cannot be accounted for. Former KIO
managers allege around Dollars 300m of that was then sent back to London on
Sheikh Fahad's instructions to be used for political purposes.
Writs issued against many former KIO managers in London by Kuwait this year
allege this money was stolen. Mr Ismail al-Shatti, president of the
committee, said yesterday: 'There were transfers reaching Dollars 510m
without justification. These transfers could be considered outright theft of
the country's funds.'
Current KIO managers and members of the Kuwaiti parliament say the former
management may be trying to hide the true destination of the money by
pretending it was used to help save the country after the invasion by Iraqi
forces.
However, Mr Betts is highly regarded in the KIO and there is no suggestion
of impropriety on his part. His testimony, if correctly reported, carries
considerable weight. He was not available for comment and Sheikh Fahad is
believed to be in the Bahamas.
The day after the invasion Sheikh Ali Khalifa, the country's former oil and
finance minister with overall responsibility for the KIO, faxed written
instructions to the world's central banks saying that only he, Sheikh Fahad,
and Sheikh Khaled Al Sabah, the KIO deputy chairman, could authorise the
movement of official Kuwaiti funds of any kind.
In his evidence to the committee Sheikh Ali Khalifa denied that 'any
payments or political transfers were made from the investment office in
London for that period to any destination'.
He said he knew nothing of a Dollars 450m loan made by the KIO to Torras in
the spring of 1990 - for which no authorisation was sought from Kuwait - and
that he did not know of the Dollars 1.2bn transferred to Spain after the
invasion.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Progress on trade lifts G7 summit prospects: Negotiators
report advance on broad tariff-cutting deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for today's economic summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations suddenly brightened last night as trade negotiators
reported some progress toward a wide-ranging tariff-cutting deal.
After nearly seven hours of talks, ministers from the so-called Quad
countries - the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada - said progress
was made in many areas towards a market access agreement that might breathe
new life into the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
All participants warned that difficult problems remained. But Mr Kabun Muto,
Japanese foreign minister, gave a hint of the scale of progress when he said
accord had been reached in some areas where the negotiators wanted to cut
tariffs to zero. The ministers declined to be more specific. They meet again
today.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said the talks had made progress on
'a wide variety of issues' and he hoped for a 'successful outcome' today. Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, was also optimistic.
Earlier, it had seemed that the G7 summit - the 19th since 1975 - would open
under a cloud of unresolved trade disputes. A meeting between US President
Bill Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday
failed to resolve a dispute between the two countries over cutting Japan's
annual current account surplus, now estimated at Dollars 150bn (Pounds
100bn).
In a joint press conference, Mr Miyazawa rejected US pressure for numerical
targets to cut the surplus. Showing little of the reticence normally
associated with 'lame duck' leaders - he faces a general election on July 18
after losing a vote of confidence - he said it was impossible for market
economies such as the US and Japan to control the level of their imports and
exports and so decide the level of their current accounts in terms of a
percentage of gross domestic product.
In the Quad talks, disagreements between the US and EC on trade in textiles
were at the centre of yesterday's problems. The US was reported to be
unwilling to cut tariffs further on textiles such as woollen suits where the
EC has a competitive advantage. The US fears having to extend the same
reductions to China and other countries under the most-favoured nation rule.
In the view of trade analysts, accord on textiles would greatly help achieve
a successful market-access package. A textiles deal would clearly indicate
to the other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the
Quad group was serious about taking multilateral trade talks forward.
As G7 leaders gathered last night, Mr John Major, the prime minister,
promised to 'badger and bully' the G7 to make progress on trade
liberalisation this week, but acknowledged that it would 'not be easy'.

FT  07 JUL 93 / Postel prepares Pounds 120m deal to save troubled Greycoat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTEL, the UK's largest pension fund, yesterday announced plans for a
Pounds 120m rescue package for Greycoat which will give it up to 87.7 per
cent of the troubled property company.
The proposals underline the increased enthusiasm for British commercial
property among institutions, which consider that property offers good value
as the market stabilises.
'We are getting a geared interest in a top-quality portfolio when the market
is turning,' said Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel.
Postel justified the unusual step of taking a large stake in a single
company by its existing expertise in property. Property accounts for about
Pounds 2.3bn of Postel's assets under management of about Pounds 20bn.
The deal may give Greycoat, which has a stake in the proposed Paternoster
Square development next to St Paul's Cathedral, a new lease of life as a
developer.
It acquired a reputation as one of London's best developers in the 1980s, as
a result of projects such as the Embankment Place office block above Charing
Cross station. The decline in property values, however, has plunged it into
financial difficulties.
Analysts were divided yesterday on whether Postel was picking up a bargain.
'This is a backdoor takeover by Postel at the expense of bondholders and
shareholders,' one said.
Others emphasised that Greycoat will remain a highly geared company, which
will work against Postel if there is a setback in the property market.
Greycoat, which owns property worth about Pounds 500m, indicated yesterday
that it had net assets of at least Pounds 80m.
As well as being a potential source of finance for Greycoat's schemes,
Postel believes Greycoat's management could exploit opportunities within its
own portfolio.
In a complex deal, Postel is underwriting a Pounds 58.9m rights issue of
ordinary shares at 12.5p and a Pounds 6.25m preference rights issue.
Greycoat is also placing Pounds 4.5m of shares with Postel and issuing it
with warrants.
Postel, which owns 5.4 per cent of Greycoat, will increase its stake to
between 27.2 per cent and 87.7 per cent, depending on the take-up of the
rights issue, although it intends to dispose of enough shares to allow
Greycoat to keep its listing. Mr Ross Goobey and another Postel director
will join Greycoat's board.

FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retail issues were again under pressure as the market continued to
reflect on the negative comments which accompanied Friday's results from
Asda. Its chief executive declared the years of high growth and fat margins
over and predicted several years of tough trading conditions. After Friday's
heavy falls, stocks across the sector were again marked back. Argyll lost 5
to 312p, Iceland 6 to 224p, Kwik Save 13 to 721p, Nurdin and Peacock 6 to
216p, J. Sainsbury 12 to 455p and Tesco 5 to 206p.
While talk in the sector was again of more downgrades to come, there was
also attention focused on the likely strategies of individual stocks. One
unlikely candidate from the fallout was Marks and Spencer, with some
speculation being heard that the group may consider changing its stance on
Sunday trading in order to combat the tough food retail environment. Sunday
trading, which M and S has traditionally opposed, is seen as a key future
battle area by industry analysts once the law has been settled. M and S
slipped 5 to 343p.
Turnover in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce rose to 13m and the shares
lost 3 1/2 to 141p on a combination of factors. UBS was said to have had a
large amount of the company's shares and was believed to have placed around
6m early in the session at 140p, which was below the market price.
Sentiment was further dented by a 30-page sell recommendation from Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken. The agency broker said: 'Profits will continue to be under
pressure, there will be large cash outflow and there may be a need for a
rights issue.'
The company also said the level of foreign share ownership had exceeded 29.5
per cent, the limit permitted under its articles of association and it was
issuing notices that will force foreign holders above that limit to
relinquish the stock.
Motor dealer T. Cowie signalled an end to its interest in motor group
Henlys, for which it unsuccessfully bid last year, when SG Warburg bought
and placed its near 10 per cent stake of 3.78m shares. The stake yielded a
healthy sum for Cowie when Warburg, having bought them at 181 1/2 p, placed
most of the stock with institutions at 183p. The market appreciated the deal
and shares in Henlys firmed 2 to 191p, while Cowie closed unchanged at 248p.
The financial areas of the market continued to hold up well in the face of
the overall decline yesterday. In the banks, Abbey National was the
outstanding performer, with its strong profits flow and solid defensive
stance behind some keen support from institutions. Abbey shares moved up 3
to 415p, albeit in rather thin turnover of only 2m shares.
The rest of the clearers, however, gave ground as the market became
increasingly aware of the growing view that another cut in UK interest rates
may be some way off.
One banking analyst said the sector looks 'increasingly stretched' and
pointed out that the banks sector yield relative is heading back to levels
not seen since the 1970s, 'leaving little margin for error in view of the
pressure which appears to be resurfacing on banking margins'.
Lloyds Bank, due to kick off the banks' interim reporting season at the end
of this month, receded 6 to 562p, while Barclays lost 4 to 477p, and NatWest
and HSBC 3 apiece to 481p and 654p respectively.
A block of 880,000 shares in Lowndes Lambert was placed by Kleinwort Benson
Securities with a number of institutions at 397p a share.
Ladbroke Group held up well against a rumoured downgrade from Hoare Govett,
the shares losing a penny to 188p. The negative sentiment in First Leisure
continued and the stock dropped 10 to 335p. Granada benfited from favourable
weekend comment over its recent television manoeuvring and gained 3 at 421p.
Worries over low food price inflation again kept food manufacturing stocks
under a cloud. Associated British Foods declined 6 to 474p, Northern Foods 6
to 269p and Cadbury-Schweppes 5 to 456p.
Property group Greycoat announced that it was discussing with Postel
Investment Management a possible restructuring of its capital base and debt.
Although Greycoat said it would make another statement in the next 48 hours,
there was no comment on weekend press reports that it intended to make a
Pounds 120m rights issue. The reports suggested that Postel would underwrite
the issue at around 12 1/2 p, a substantial discount to yesterday's price.
The shares closed three-quarters of a penny down at 19 1/2 p.
After their recent strong performance, the regional electricity stocks were
subject to profit-taking. Among those hit were East Midlands, which slipped
7 to 468p, Midlands, 9 down at 483p, and Eastern, 6 cheaper at 489p.
A move by National Power into the US market, with the Pounds 105m purchase
of a Texan gas supplier, failed to prevent it slipping back with the sector.
The shares shed 7 to 364p.
The market's latest newcomer, Business Post, continued the recent run of
sparkling Stock Exchange debuts, with the shares closing at 133p, compared
with the 120p placing price.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil companies meet on
Azerbaijan project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN OIL companies involved in negotiations over a Dollars 9bn project to
develop three oilfields in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea are
meeting in New York today following talks with the new Azeri government last
Thursday.
The group of eight western oil companies saw long-term talks with Socar, the
Azeri state oil company, interrupted recently by political upheaval in the
republic which replaced the populist government with hardliners.
The companies are continuing to discuss plans in New York for unifying the
three oilfields in one development in spite of indications that the new
government could switch back to individual negotiations.
Mr Stephen Remp, chairman and chief executive of Ramco, a small UK oil
services company which is involved in the talks said the companies had
instructions from Socar, the Azeri state oil company to continue talks on
integrating the development.
He said that the group of eight oil companies including British Petroleum,
Amoco and Pennzoil hoped to hear from the Azeri government this week. The
Azeris are being represented in New York by their advisers, Morgan Grenfell.
Socar yesterday indicated to the Reuter news agency that the Azeri
government would be looking for more profit from the deal and could throw
open the negotiations to other oil companies.
'The new government wants to see what is going on, but there is a strong
desire to move forward quickly by both the government and Socar,' Mr Remp
said.
He added that it would severely delay the projects if a tender were to be
put out to other oil companies.
The western partners are talking about the development of the Guneshli,
Azeri and Chirakh fields offshore of Baku. Guneshli is already in
production, but the other two fields need to be explored and developed. The
three fields are estimated to contain 4bn barrels of oil.

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Equity Issues: Hong Kong listing for Shanghai
Petrochemical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHANGHAI Petrochemical, the largest of the nine Chinese state-owned
companies to seek a stock market listing in Hong Kong, yesterday came to the
market for up to HKDollars 2.72bn (Dollars 351m) in an issue which will see
30 per cent of the company listed internationally.
Company officials said proceeds would be used to repay foreign currency
borrowings of HKDollars 950m falling due in 1993 and 1994, to finance
capital expenditure this year and next of HKDollars 1.25bn and to increase
working capital.
The company's financial advisers, Merrill Lynch and Peregrine Capital, a
Hong Kong broker, will split the issue of 1.68bn H shares equally between
Hong Kong and the rest of the world.
US investors will be offered American depositary receipts - each equal to
100 shares in Shanghai Petrochemical - and European investors either ADRs or
lines of unbundled stock.
The issue price, to be determined by tender in the US, is expected to be
between HKDollars 1.55 and HKDollars 1.74 a share, giving the stock a
prospective price/earnings ratio of 12.3 to 13.8 on forecast 1993 net
earnings of Yn848m (HKDollars 612.7m).
Depending on the level of subscription in Hong Kong, up to 168m of the
shares allocated to international investors may be clawed back to satisfy
demand in the colony.
Last week, Tsingtao Brewery offered 317.6m shares at HKDollars 2.80 each to
raise HKDollars 889m. Indications yesterday were that the offer was around
100 times oversubscribed with some HKDollars 100bn committed to the offer.
Shanghai Petrochemical is China's largest petrochemical company and the
mainland's ninth biggest industrial group. Its main lines of business are
synthetic fibres, resins and plastics, intermediate petrochemicals and
petroleum products.
The company is dependent solely on the Chinese economy. It buys its main
input, oil, at a subsidised price and 40 per cent of its output is sold at
below market prices. The crude oil subsidy will remain intact until 1995.
Mr Wang Jiming, Shanghai Petrochemical's chairman, said, however, that
planned additions to the company's plant and further economic liberalisation
in China would fuel significant earnings growth in the years ahead.
Any move by the state to raise the price of crude oil towards the free
market price would be compensated by price increases in the company's
products, he added.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONEX, a diversified management company controlled by Toronto financier Mr
Gerald Schwartz, plans to reduce its holding in Automotive Industries, a
leading North American car interior parts producer, from 35 to 20 per cent.
Automotive has filed a financing package with the Securities and Exchange
Commission covering the offer of 2m new common shares and the sale of 2.6m
existing shares, including 1.25m held by Onex. The issue is being made
solely in the US.
Onex said it expected to receive about CDollars 40m (USDollars 31.2m) for
its 1.25m Automotive shares and record a gain of about CDollars 30m. It
would retain 20 per cent of Automotive after the new share issue.
Onex has most of its assets in the US, including subsidiaries in airline
catering, food service equipment, automotive and construction equipment.
Its latest investment was in a US wire producer earlier this year, while it
plans to sell its interest in a Canadian courier to Canada Post.
Its asset sale was control of Beatrice Foods in the US in 1991 for CDollars
475m.

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Formosa Plastics complex to go
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMOSA Plastics will shortly start work on a TDollars 210bn (USDollars 8bn)
petrochemical complex after securing rights to use submerged land on
Taiwan's south-west coast.
News that the island's largest private investment project will finally
proceed gave a boost to Taipei's efforts to urge local manufacturers to
invest at home instead of mainland China.
Mr P. K. Chiang, minister of economic affairs, said: 'Formosa Plastics'
sixth cracker project will have a major impact on increasing private
investment and industrial production.'
He added that output from the complex would slice Taiwan's reliance on
imported petrochemicals from 50 to 10 per cent of local demand.
The acquisition of land-use rights was the most vexing of the problems that
have plagued the plan to build the island's sixth cracker and related
expansion projects since group chairman Mr Y. C. Wang proposed the project
nearly seven years ago.
The ministry of economic affairs has made 1,940 hectares of public land, now
underwater, available at a price of TDollars 563.4m. Authorities in Yunlin
County, where the complex will be built, had earlier supplied Formosa
Plastics with 543 hectares of land.
Reclamation costs will be borne by the investors, probably with assistance
from government-backed financing.
The complex will include two refineries, two naphtha crackers and up to 39
petrochemical intermediates plants, most of which will built by Formosa
Plastics and other local companies. The plan also includes construction of a
TDollars 15bn industrial port.
Formosa Plastics will launch reclamation work after transfer of the land use
rights is completed by July 10. Priority will be given to reclaiming land
for a machinery plant, and constructing dormitories for workers, gravel
storage sites, roadways and sewers.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'We're after the bits that make a
profit' / A look at a coal company seeking high returns from rock-bottom
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE weed-covered railway line which winds its way up the Neath Valley in
South Wales will shortly be clanking with wagons again.
Ryan Group, the privately-owned coal company, is restoring the track with a
Pounds 4m grant from the Welsh Office so it can haul coal from its Lyn and
Pentreclwydau mines. Ryan expects that when fully developed the two sites
will be the largest private underground mines in the UK, producing 600,000
tonnes to 700,000 tonnes of anthracite a year between them.
As the UK coal industry shakes itself out with the imminent privatisation of
British Coal, Mr Crispian Hotson, Ryan's South African-born chief executive,
says: 'We're not after the massive tonnages. We're after the bits that make
a profit.'
Ryan was originally a publicly quoted company which grew by recovering coal
dumped by collieries in the River Usk. But by the mid 1980s it was
loss-making and deeply in debt. Mr Hotson and his business partners injected
capital and took over management control, eventually buying the company in
1988.
Last year Ryan refinanced itself with Pounds 50m of equity from Electra, the
venture capital group, Bankers Trust and Creditanstalt Bankverein of
Austria, enabling it to reduce its large bank debts and get its balance
sheet in order. Mr Hotson expects to see annual losses of more than Pounds
4m transformed into a profit of Pounds 7m this year.
Following a radical restructuring which involved sales and closures, Ryan
now has three divisions. The largest is opencast mining, where its
subsidiary, Crouch Mining, produces 4m tonnes a year under contract for
British Coal. It also has a subsidiary in Pennsylvania which mines coal for
local utilities. The underground mining division is responsible for the
Neath Valley operations, and the third division is engaged in coal recovery
in Belgium and Poland.
Mr Hotson's vision of the future is based on a competitive coal industry
operating at a fraction of the costs of British Coal. With present trends,
Mr Hotson sees the UK coal industry shrinking to about 40m tonnes a year
(from 76m last year) by the year 2000. About half of that would come from
opencast operations, 16m from British Coal pits, and 4m from privately-owned
underground mines.
Mr Hotson thinks output from the underground mines could be raised to 30m to
40m tonnes if the private sector were given free rein to drive down costs
and introduce efficient working practices. In that case the UK could not
only wipe out imports, but might even export coal again.
Ryan expects to be among the bidders for licences from British Coal to
operate mines which the state-owned company cannot afford to keep open. None
of those currently on offer is of interest, but Mr Hotson says Ryan might
bid for Betws, the small south Wales anthracite mine, and 'one or two pits
in Nottinghamshire'.
He is looking for mines with 20 to 30 years of reserves, where Ryan can use
new techniques to get production costs below Pounds 1 a gigajoule, compared
with the Pounds 1.53 at which British Coal is supplying the generators. Ryan
is producing coal from open-cast mines for 60p a gigajoule.
At these lower prices, Mr Hotson says, domestically produced coal will not
only drive out imports but also compete strongly with alternative fuels,
particularly natural gas which poses the greatest threat to coal. He
believes that cheap coal could trigger the construction of a new generation
of coal-fired power stations using efficient clean coal technology.
Instead of the familiar giants, these would be small stations with a
capacity of as little at 200MW each. Ryan might get into the electricity
generation business itself if it can find suitable partners.
The recent flotation of another privately-owned coal mining group, RJB
Mining, has raised speculation that Ryan might try the same. But Ryan has
yet to build up its profit record. Also, Mr Hotson would rather bide his
time. The muted welcome given to RJB by the stock market suggested that the
outlook for private mining is still too clouded to fire investors'
enthusiasm.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Spain arranges Ecu4bn borrowing facility
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Spain is putting in place an Ecu4bn (Dollars 4.6bn) borrowing
facility, which bankers claim is the largest financing to be put together by
any European government this year.
NatWest Capital Markets , which is arranging the multi-currency revolving
credit facility, said the deal was being put together 'to reflect changes to
the ways in which European Community governments fund themselves following
the signing of the Maastricht Treaty'.
It added that 'under the terms of the Treaty, the Bank of Spain will, from 1
January 1994, be forbidden to provide credit lines to the Treasury of the
Kingdom of Spain.
'The three-year facility is designed to replace those credit lines.'
'This is not a foreign exchange support system, but it is required and it
will be drawn on like an overdraft facility,' said one banker.
NatWest Capital Markets has been in discussions with other European
sovereign borrowers, including Italy, about structuring similar deals.
Last September, the UK Treasury announced a Ecu10bn multi-currency funding
programme, which was aimed at supporting sterling in the foreign exchange
market and funding government spending.
The financing was seen as 'emergency funding' at a time when sterling was
under considerable pressure in the foreign exchange market.
By contrast, the Kingdom of Spain's deal is not intended for currency
support, but as a means of establishing long-term liquidity.
NatWest Capital Markets said the deal has been fully underwritten by a group
consisting of: ABN AMRO Bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Citibank, Dresdner Bank,
National Westminster Bank, Societe Generale, and Sumitomo Bank.
'Banks are screaming out for quality assets and we feel they will support
this' said one banker involved in the deal.
The Kingdom of Spain has a double A credit rating.
The deal will probably be signed in September and is unlikely to be drawn
before year-end, bankers admitted.

United Nations weapons inspectors left Baghdad yesterday after failing to
persuade Iraq to comply with UN Security Council resolutions and let them
install monitoring cameras at missile test sites, Reuter reports from
Baghdad. A Baghdad newspaper said the inspectors were US lackeys and Iraq
would never succumb to intimidation.
The experts flew to Larnaca in Cyprus, where Mr Nikita Smidovich, their
leader, said: 'Iraq chose this specific issue to put a political spotlight
on relations between Iraq and the UN special commission (on destroying Iraqi
weapons). Iraq considers it has implemented all the provisions of resolution
687 while the special commission still has questions.'

Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said after more than two hours of
talks yesterday in Cairo with Mr Amr Moussa, his Egyptian counterpart, that
the US draft document could 'serve as a basis for continuation' of the
stalled Middle East peace talks, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo.
However, he offered nothing on the inclusion of the issue of Jerusalem in
talks aiming towards interim Palestinian self-rule. 'Israel has a position
on Jerusalem that is clear and known and decided,' he said. 'I don't think
we're going to depart from this.'
Mr Moussa also added his backing to the US draft, calling it a 'good basis'
but repeating Egypt's position that Jerusalem should be part of the talks.

Iran's IRNA news agency quoted the official, Mr Asghar Ebrahimi, as saying
Chinese companies would invest Dollars 300m of the total. He was speaking
while accompanying China's vice-premier Li Lanqing on a tour of Metro
construction sites. Mr Ebrahimi also said that China would provide Dollars
120m in credits to build subway carriages.
Other agreements with Chinese enterprises covered the building of a 145MW
gas-fired power plant and electricity distribution networks, he said.

its sophisticated 'creep-feed' grinding machines.
J&amp;S described the order as a breakthrough in terms of industrial application

Creep-feed grinding involves passing the component under the grinding wheel
at a slow pace, allowing more metal to be removed. The order for Tong Nam

FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland warning for G7
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, warned yesterday that failure by the Group of Seven
leaders to inject new momentum into the stalled world trade talks at their
summit in Tokyo later this week would put not only the Uruguay Round but the
multilateral trading system and the world economy at risk.
'Concrete progress' on a package to open markets to foreign goods and
services was needed to relaunch the 116-nation negotiations in Geneva, he
said. With just five months before the December 15 deadline for concluding
the round, a failure to move forward would deal the round 'a very serious
blow' and endanger the multilateral trading structure built up since the
war.
In his first news conference since taking over at the helm of Gatt on July
1, Mr Sutherland said the best hope for the 26m jobless in the G7 countries
lay in bolstering business confidence with a rapid and successful conclusion
to the round.
Calling on the summit to resist protectionist pressures, he said some 23m
jobs in the seven countries depended on exports of goods and would be at
risk from protection of ailing industrial sectors.
'It cannot surely be the case that special interest groups within the major
trading areas can hold the whole process to ransom,' he said. 'If the G7
leaders are serious about attacking the root of chronic long-term
unemployment, about re-igniting growth and prosperity, about creating a new
dynamism, the way to do it is by actively assisting in the conclusion of the
Uruguay Round.'
This could boost world income by Dollars 200bn a year.
Mr Sutherland added that despite recent setbacks he expected a successful
conclusion to the round. 'I cannot believe we are capable of taking such a
collectively ridiculous decision as to endanger the multilateral system.'
Making clear he intended to take an active role in shepherding the
seven-year-old round to completion in December, Mr Sutherland said he would
'devote every bit of energy' he had to finding solutions to problems
blocking progress.
However, his 'fundamental role' was as an honest broker between the parties.

Leaders of eight Romanian opposition parties yesterday demanded the
resignation of Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu's left-wing minority government, Reuter
reports from Bucharest.
'The government is incompetent, it does not function properly and therefore
it must go,' said Mr Corneliu Coposu, leader of the opposition National
Peasant Party.
The demand was a response to a statement by the government last week
praising the way it had governed the country since taking office last
September. It accused the opposition of mounting a 'furious campaign against
the government, aimed at creating social tension'.
The government also denounced opposition attempts last week to call a
session of parliament to discuss a report on corruption and to introduce a
no-confidence motion. It accused the opposition of wanting to stage a coup
to remove the cabinet.

The Bank of Portugal yesterday cut its money market intervention rates by

Economists expect money rates to fall below 10 per cent by the end of the

target of reducing the inflation rate to 5-7 per cent this year from 8.9 per

Poland brought in value added tax yesterday, set generally at 22 per cent
but with a 7 per cent rate for items such as childrens' goods and
construction materials, and a zero rating for basic food items, writes
Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw.
The government expects VAT, which replaces a turnover tax, to add only 1.5
percentage points to the annual inflation rate.
The tax rises will be phased in as old VAT-free stocks are replaced. In a
last-minute rush to avoid price rises, Poles have been on a shopping spree.
Cars and lorries have also blocked border crossings with Germany in a
scramble to import goods before the tax took effect.

FT  06 JUL 93 / French franc slips against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH franc continued to weaken against the D-Mark inside the European
exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers suggested that signs of
weakness in the economy were putting pressure on the Bank of France to cut
interest rates, writes James Blitz.
It closed at FFr3.386, having been at FFr3.383 in London on Friday night.
Last night's close left it some 2 centimes weaker against the D-Mark than it
had been a week ago. Against its ERM divergence indicator, the franc closed
at minus 61 percentage points.
Dealers said a spate of poor economic indicators, last week's unemployment
figures among them, had made an interest rate cut even more urgent. Although
the Bundesbank reduced its official interest rates by half a percentage
point last week, some saw this yesterday as insufficient for France's
economic needs.

<TEXT>
Confirmation that collaboration talks between British Aerospace and GEC had
taken place but had now ceased continued to excite the market and made BAe
the day's best performer among FT-SE 100 stocks.
Weekend press reports that the two groups were in talks about merging their
defence operations led the two companies to issue a statement early
yesterday saying: 'Discussions on a fuller collaboration have ceased.'
However, market watchers remain convinced that such a deal may be possible
at a later date and a deal will necessitate a cash injection from GEC into
BAe. The shares responded by moving 4 ahead to 386p on trading volume of
2.6m. GEC closed 11 lower at 322p ex-dividend, with most of that fall
accounted for by the 7.62p final dividend payment.

FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Import threat to brewers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING worries over the outlook for the domestic beer market left UK
brewing shares trailing yesterday, with Whitbread coming under scrutiny from
one broker and a series of downgrades accompanying figures from Scottish &amp;
New-castle.
NatWest Securities reiterated its negative stance on the domestic brewers
and its sell advice on Whitbread after warning that imported Continental
beers and lagers are likely to pose an increasing threat to company profits.
In particular, NatWest notes that Tesco has recently begun importing cheaper
Stella Artois lager from Belgium, usurping supplies brewed under licence by
Whitbread in the UK. This has added to concern that the broker has about
Whitbread, which has a high rating having been earmarked in some quarters as
a key recovery stock.
But the broker stresses: 'The longer term effect will go far beyond premium
Continental lagers and affect the whole pricing structure for lager in the
off-trade. This in turn will further undermine the profitability of UK
domestic brewers.'
Figures from S &amp; N were duller than the market had expected, with analysts'
forecasts being cut to a range of around Pounds 200m to Pounds 230m. While
the lesiure division performed well enough, flat domestic brewing numbers
and fairly ordinary retail figures produced slightly disappointing profits.
S &amp; N fell badly but recovered to close only 2 adrift at 459p. Whitbread 'A'
declined 10 to 489p on good volume of 3.7m. Bass lost 10 to 472p, Grand
Metropolitan 5 to 421p and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 6 to 496p.

FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Economic slowdown fears hit equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE that the economic recovery in the UK may be running out of steam,
and persistent worries that the US economy has begun to falter, triggered
another sharp sell-off of the FT-SE futures and continued to drive London's
equity market lower at the start of the new two-week trading account
yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended the session only marginally above the day's lowest
level, a net 19.2 weaker at 2,838.5, the bottom end of its recent perceived
trading range.
However, senior traders in London were reluctant to read too much into what
was generally agreed to be a dismal showing by a London market unsettled by
Wall Street's unhappy performance last Friday and the absence of any lead
from the US yesterday, markets being closed for the Independence Day
holiday.
Dealers also pointed out that fund managers would be reluctant to adopt
aggressive positions in either direction ahead of tomorrow's G7 meeting.
Still unsettled by the late sell-off in equities last week, the FT-SE
100-share index opened in negative territory and continued to lose ground
throughout the rest of a difficult trading session, led down by concerted
selling efforts in the futures market.
The Footsie began some four points easier and moved progressively lower to
reach 2,835.8 during the early afternoon, before embarking on a half-hearted
rally which saw the index close within three points of the day's low.
Sentiment in the market was damaged from the outset with the latest report
from the Institute of Directors saying that business confidence had fallen
for the first time since the UK withdrew from the European exchange rate
mechanism last September.
More bad news for the market came with the latest economic data showing a
lower than expected increase in consumer credit during May. Money supply
figures for June showing a year-on-year rise in MO of 4.6 per cent were
slightly below estimates.
With the futures market still thoroughly depressed and under sustained
pressure from the abritrageurs, who continued to sell the cash market
aggressively and cover in the futures, the FT-SE 100 was left to find a
trading level.
Dealers said there was widespread concern about the stability of
international bond markets following last week's worrying economic data from
the US, which revealed a marked slowing in non-farm payrolls. 'If gilts and
bonds do not fall out of bed, then we will be OK, but if not, then it looks
tricky,' was the view of a senior London marketmaker.
The lack of a lead from the US, plus the market's overall caution, saw
turnover in equities fall to the lowest levels for many weeks. Volume
totalled a meagre 384m shares, made up of 151m FT-SE 100 shares and 232.9m
non-Footsie stocks, with the figures confirming despairing comments on the
paucity of activity from market traders.
Brokers said yesterday's customer business would fall short of the Pounds
1bn level, which has been breached on the downside on only a handful of
occasions this year.
The water issues, roughly handled in recent sessions, was one of the more
resilient areas of the market, as were bank shares. But food retailing
stocks continued to suffer from the impact of last week's remarks made by
Asda.

FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN over both the US and UK economies led to nervous trading which
brought a retreat in stock index futures on the first day of the new
account, writes Joel Kibazo.
A survey from the Institute of Directors indicating doubts about the UK
economic recovery led to nervous trading from the outset as the September
Footsie contract opened at 2,857, though it was at a premium to the cash
market.
However, the premium was eroded within the first half-hour of trading as
strong selling drove the contract down to 2,839 as worries about the economy
took hold.
Poor data on UK money supply and consumer credit kept the contract subdued
for the rest of the session, only occasionally trading at a premium to cash.
It closed at the day's low of 2,837, a 7-point discount to its fair value
premium to cash, which fell to 7 points on this account. Volume was a
reasonable 8,840 contracts.
Good business in Asda stock options boosted total option turnover yesterday
to 30,686 contracts. It traded 7,640 lots, with most of that total coming
from the July 67 puts.
It was followed by BT at 2,107 and then by British Gas with a day's total of
1,108 lots. The list of active stock options also included Hanson and
Lonrho.
Just over 8,000 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,933 were
traded in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.

TORONTO eased in lacklustre trading as the US holiday subdued dealings. The
TSE 300 index shed 7.2 to 3,990.5 and falls led rises by 388 to 303.
The oil and gas index lost 1.7 per cent. Brokers said there was concern that
Iraq would reach agreement with the UN to start selling oil on the world
markets again after facing long-term sanctions.
Wall Street was closed for Independence Day.

FT  06 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Muted response to Buba rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor economic news from the US, political uncertainty in Japan, and a weak
response by senior European bourses to the first Bundesbank key interest
rate cuts in more than two months, restricted the FT-Actuaries World Index
to a token gain, of 0.1 per cent in local currency terms, last week.
On Wall Street, the Dow was flat in advance of the week's economic data,
beat a minor tactical retreat on Thursday's drop in the NAPM index of
industrial activity, and tumbled after Friday's rise in the national
unemployment rate. The losses in equities, however, were restrained by an
improvement in the domestic bond market.
Japan's equity market, similarly, started with a recovery as the ruling
Liberal Democratic party showed resilience in municipal elections in Tokyo.
However, after that it faltered, fluctuated and faltered again on a bribery
scandal in the construction industry, and renewed political uncertainty
ahead of the Japanese general election in 12 days' time.
The Bundesbank rate cuts were the first since April 22. Bourses had
anticipated them, although 50 basis points off the discount rate, against a
25-point cut in the Lombard, was more than most analysts had expected.
Unfortunately, although a number of other European central banks cut their
rates too, the depth of the German discount rate cut rebounded against
equity markets as economists decided that the Bundesbank was now unlikely to
come back with another rate cut until September.
The most interesting performances last week were put in by Belgium and the
Nordic bloc in Europe, and by the Pacific markets excluding Japan.
After peaking in April, Belgium suffered along with other strong currency
markets as the Bundesbank's interest rate policies were hamstrung by the
costs of integrating eastern Germany and its wariness of domestic inflation.
However, says Ms Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson, Belgium delivered an
outstanding performance in June as two domestic interest rate cuts in as
many weeks drove the market to an all-time high.
'The next Bundesbank rate reduction is not expected until after the summer
recess,' says Ms Rowe, 'but the Belgian desire to reduce rates in concert
with the Dutch should drive the market higher'.
Finland was the outstanding performer of the week with an 8.6 per cent gain,
taking its local currency appreciation to 46.3 per cent this year. Helsinki
was the prime mover in a Nordic bloc rise of 2.5 per cent; but Hoare Govett
notes that the market was not permanently on the upgrade, falling 8.8 per
cent during the month to June 25 and underperforming continental Europe by
6.2 per cent.
Performance around the Pacific Rim has been taken almost for granted in the
past quarter, as fund managers have tried to escape from the grinding
poverty of US equity returns, the slowdown in Japan and the fear that Europe
had seen all of its gains in virtually the first three months of 1993.
But Australia, which has been lagging behind, came close to the front of the
pack as the gold bullion price put on another spurt and gold shares rose
17.8 per cent.

FT  06 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan sluggish despite labour
accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMER holidays in Europe, and the Independence Day holiday in the US were
reflected in low turnover figures from bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MILAN surprised many observers by not performing as strongly as expected
following the weekend agreement on wages. The Comit index closed up 2.77 at
540.83.
The labour accord raises hopes of a cut in interest rates in the near
future, probably in the order of 50 basis points, analysts remarked.
However, in spite of this positive news, the overall mood continued to be
dampened by Ferruzzi group shares, with Montedison losing another L40 or 5.5
per cent to L680. The chairman of the Consob is due to testify today to
parliament on the group's situation.
Telecommunications stocks, which have been one of the strongest performing
sectors in recent weeks, also eased on worries that privatisation might be
delayed: Stet lost L40 to L3,610.
FRANKFURT eased in quiet trading, the DAX index sliding 5.64 to 1,692.17 as
turnover fell from DM6.2bn to DM4.6bn and Siemens and Volkswagen came under
pressure.
Siemens finished DM3.30 lower at DM612.50 after the electrical major made
downwards revisions to its 1992-93 sales and orders forecasts and said that
earnings would be hit by the overall rise of the D-Mark against the dollar.
A large sell order, technical consolidation after recent strong gains and
further developments in the inter-company strife over the departure of Mr
Ignacio Lopez from GM to Volkswagen left VW DM4.50 lower at DM355.80.
Among second liners, Altana fell DM8.70 to DM506.20 as Dresdner launched a
DM100m Eurobond issue for the company.
ZURICH consolidated, some investors selling chemicals for banks ahead of the
banking sector's half-year results season. Dealers said that the pressure on
chemicals was light as Ciba-Geigy bearers fell SFr14 to SFr697 and the SMI
index fell 4.8 to 2,364.0.
UBS bearers made the strongest showing in the banking sector, rising SFr18
to SFr1,134. Hoare Govett says in a review of European banks that there is
considerable further upside before the banks even get close to the ratings
which they enjoyed before they began their long period of underperformance
in the mid-1980s.
PARIS drifted lower in an unenthusiastic session, the CAC-40 index losing
15.72 to 1,925.44. Turnover was also low at FFr1.8bn.
Rhone-Poulenc, which announced last week a four-for-one share split next
Monday, and yesterday set a price of FFr563 for the sale of its 35 per cent
stake of Rousell Uclaf, lost FFr14 to FFr571.
MADRID's turnover fell from Pta16.5bn to Pta9.3bn as the general index
closed 1.97 lower at 257.42, Banesto falling Pta80 to Pta2,155 as James
Capel described it as 'at best a hold'.
AMSTERDAM saw a good gain in KLM, up Fl 1.00 to Fl 27.10 but otherwise the
market was negative and the CBS Tendency index finished off 0.2 at 112.3.
HELSINKI rose on strength in Nokia, up FM6 at FM191, together with low money
market rates. The shares have been helped higher by news last week that it
was to increase the size of an international share placement. The Hex index
gained 2.62 per cent to close at 1,204.0.
VIENNA fell by 1.7 per cent but volume was reported low as the ATX index
fell 14.55 to 825.45.
TEL AVIV, down 1.4 per cent, lost most of Sunday's gains in a late sell-off
as the Mishtanim blue chip index lost 2.78 to 197.17 in active turnover of
Shk226m.
WARSAW shot up again, this time by 8.9 per cent as the WIG passed the 4,000
barrier for the first time to close at 4,005.1. Turnover was high at 478.1bn
zloty (Dollars 28m).
ISTANBUL was depressed by weekend violence in central Anatolia where 36
people were killed and the composite index lost 97.7 to 11,697.

THE Nikkei average posted a marginal gain on the lowest volume since January
18 as investors remained inactive due to the two-day Bank of Japan branch
managers' meeting, which ends today, and the Tokyo G7 summit, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average appreciated just 1.60 to 19,623.06 after wavering
between 19,545.45 and 19,676.07.
Volume fell to 150m shares from 226m. Declines led advances by 576 to 402,
with 169 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
dipped 12.00 to 1,583.42, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.21
at 1,200.95.
Many traders expect investors to refrain from building positions ahead of
the general election on July 18. However, Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities
said the current lull in the market resembled the situation in January this
year, when share prices jumped on active buying after a few weeks of low
trading volume.
Issues closely linked with East Japan Railway, the state-owned regional
railway company which officially applied for listing on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange yesterday, were mixed. Market participants hope that the JR East
shares will be a catalyst for the equity market, by attracting the interest
of individual investors.
Nippon Signal, a leading railway signal maker, rose Y20 to Y1,590, but
Kyosan Electric, another signal manufacturer, receded Y10 to Y1,180.
Nikkatsu, the movie producer which filed for court protection under the
bankruptcy law yesterday, ended at an offered price of Y99. The company is
scheduled to be delisted on October 2.
Meanwhile, Shionogi, the drug maker which will replace Nikkatsu as a Nikkei
225 component stock, became the day's most active issue, firming Y10 to
Y1,060 on continued buying orders.
Janome Sewing Machine dropped Y31 to Y390. Reports that a former executive
was seeking Y120bn in damages from Janome's board members for the company's
massive debts prompted selling.
Mitsubishi Motors declined Y6 to Y754 as Chrysler, the US car maker, was
poised to release its 2.72 per cent stake in the company. Other car shares
were firm on the weaker yen, with Nissan Motor up Y11 to Y695.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 57.15 to 21,706.08 in volume of 16m
shares. Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING was much in evidence among the Pacific Rim's markets
yesterday.
NEW ZEALAND accelerated to a new three-year closing high, assisted by a
robust performance by Telecom, 14 cents ahead at NZDollars 3.25, and a
further easing in interest rates. The NZSE-40 index moved forward 16.46 to
1,715.52 in high turnover of NZDollars 38.2m.
However, Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey both declined on
profit-taking, Fletcher dipping 3 cents to NZDollars 2.89 and CHH easing a
cent to NZDollars 2.96.
HONG KONG fell back at the close as early gains were erased by
profit-taking, triggered by news that the first day of the Sino-British
talks had ended inconclusively.
The Hang Seng index lost a net 12.52 at 7,205.41, having risen by more than
120 points earlier in the day on news that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, is to visit China to hold talks on Hong Kong's political reforms.
Turnover stood at HKDollars 4.06bn against HKDollars 5.10bn on Friday.
SINGAPORE rose on selective buying interest in Malaysian shares traded over
the counter.
The Straits Times Industrial index gained 7.69 at 1,825.92.
Brokers said a report that forecasts of 1993 and 1994 corporate earnings had
been revised upwards by analysts also underpinned the market. Volume came to
129.22m shares.
SEOUL saw buying focused on financial shares and large manufacturing
companies. The composite index ended 4.48 higher at 752.78 in turnover of
Won396.5bn.
News that Dong-Ah Construction would sign joint-venture deals in China worth
some Dollars 3bn helped to lift construction stocks. Dong-Ah closed the
day's limit up, appreciating Won1,000 to Won22,000.
TAIWAN reversed an early 50-point gain, the weighted index finishing 9.91
lower at 3,907.33. Turnover totalled TDollars 11.9bn.
Early rises were triggered by unconfirmed reports that the Formosa Plastics
group was about to announce a Dollars 7.5bn petrochemicals project. Formosa
rose 50 cents to TDollars 41.30.
MANILA slipped back as investors took profits on selected blue chips. The
composite index dipped 4.46 to 1,579.51 in turnover down to 263.7m pesos.
AUSTRALIA featured gold stocks in an otherwise subdued session, the gold
shares index strengthening 50.2 to 2,154.2 while the All Ordinaries index
lost 3.0 to 1,765.9. Turnover amounted to ADollars 311.8m.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Worries on France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ

<TEXT>
THERE WERE suggestions in French money markets yesterday that France's
interest rates may have to stay high for some time, following the franc's
poor performance inside the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James
Blitz.
Several weeks ago, the outlook for French financial instruments was strong,
and French 10-year bond yields moved close to their German counterparts amid
fears over German inflation.
Profit-taking led to new weakness in French bonds and the French currency on
Friday, and this trend continued yesterday. But some dealers added that the
right-wing government looked to be under increasing pressure to push
interest rates well below German levels at any cost, and this was forcing
dealers to rethink the outlook for French rates.
Concern was raised over the extraordinarily high levels of French
unemployment, a record 11.5 per cent in May, which may fuel the
govern-ment's desire to ease monetary policy. However, this spec-ulation had
a negative effect on the currency, possibly making it difficult for the Bank
of France to ease policy.
Three-month French cash therefore moved sharply higher on the day, rising
nearly 20 basis points to close at 7.05 per cent on the bid side.
The September French franc futures contract finished 9 basis points lower at
93.40, suggesting that French rates will come down by less than  1/2
percentage point over the next 2 1/2 months.
German money markets saw little action, with the Bundesbank having already
set a fixed rate repo at 7.30 per cent for this week. The September Euromark
contract closed one basis point firmer at 93.16.
Sterling markets were little moved, although futures dealers remained
confident that  1/2 percentage point will come off base rates before the end
of the year.
The speedy removal of a Pounds 1.4bn shortage left three-month money
unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent. The December short sterling contract was more
or less unaltered at 94.44.
Italy yesterday reduced its main interest rates by a full percentage point,
with the discount rate coming down to 9 per cent and the Lombard rate to 10
per cent.
This move was larger than the market had expected, but came after the
signing of a key wages deal over the weekend.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc under more pressure
</HEADLINE>

THE FRENCH franc yesterday came under more pressure inside the European
exchange rate mechanism as dealers took the view that France will find it
hard to live with the current pace of Bundesbank interest rate cutting for
much longer, writes James Blitz.
Last week, the Bundesbank reduced its discount rate by 50 basis points to
6.75 per cent, in a move which added to hopes that European monetary policy
was easing and that tensions in the ERM had subsided once and for all.
However, the Bank of France almost immediately took advantage of the German
cut, bringing its intervention rate down to Germany's discount rate level
last Friday. Some dealers argued yesterday that the speed with which the
French authorities followed the German move suggested that France would do
what ever was necessary to ease monetary policy and boost the economy.
That sentiment has pushed the franc nearly two centimes lower against the
D-Mark in the last week, to finish yesterday at FFr3.386 from a close on
Friday night of FFr3.383. On its ERM divergence indicator, the franc ended
yesterday at a remarkably low level of minus 61 percentage points.
The French franc has partly been undermined by a broader feeling in foreign
exchange markets that Europe's central banks have been too ambitious in
trying to decouple their monetary policies from the Bundesbank.
The Bundesbank cut - and signs that M3 money supply growth is falling into
line with Bundesbank targets - helped to strengthen the D-Mark against
several European currencies yesterday.
The Danish krone closed a touch weaker at DKr3.8483 per D-Mark. The
divergence between the Dutch guilder and the D-Mark also narrowed, to 36
basis points, having been as high as  1/2 percentage point in recent weeks.
Even the dollar has shown signs of weakness against the D-Mark, after
breaking through the key level of DM1.67 three weeks ago: although last
night it closed in London unchanged on the day at DM1.6960.
However, the French franc appears particularly vulnerable, having been
undermined by a rising tide of grim economic news. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of
research at Swiss Banking Corporation, said the French economy is undermined
by bad consumer expenditure and corporate earnings figures, and a belief
that the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has
only a limited window of opportunity to boost the economy before the
presidential elections due in 1995.
Sterling was the one currency to perform strongly against the D-Mark
yesterday, rising  1/2 pfennig on the day to close at DM2.5625. The currency
was helped by higher than expected figures for net consumer credit in May,
and a report from Treasury advisers showing that the UK was set for above
trend growth.

rise

<TEXT>
THE HUGE government-owned electric utility that provides power to half of
the US's Pacific north-west has proposed a power rate increase that could
dent the region's faltering economy, and is expected to trim output at some
of the area's ten big aluminum smelters.
Rates for municipalities will go up an average of 15.7 per cent on October
1, but Mr Stuart Clarke, spokesman for the Bonneville Power Administration,
said aluminium companies will see an increase of about 17 per cent. The BPA
had earlier suggested the rise could be as high as 24 per cent.
The agency said that a two-year drought had reduced power production at its
big hydro-electric projects, cutting revenues and contributing to the rate
increase. Growing demands on the utility to protect fish and wildlife in its
vast operating regions had also taxed the agency's budget.
The BPA delivers power to Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and several
other western states. Ironically, the BPA said low aluminium prices
contributed to the decision to hike power rates. The utility pegs the power
rates it charges aluminium smelters to the world price of aluminum. With
aluminium prices at historic lows, smelters have been receiving the cheapest
power available from the BPA, reducing the agency's revenues. Analysts say
the area's aluminum producers already pay 20 per cent more for power than
competitors in other countries. Nine of the region's biggest smelters
trimmed output by about 25 per cent in March, when the drought forced the
BPA to reduce power delivery.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fear stalks Assam tea estates -
A campaign of kidnapping and extortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODRICKE GROUP, a leading Indian tea producer with a majority of UK
shareholders, made an unusual entry in last year's balance sheet - a ransom
payment of Rs2m (Pounds 42,000) to a militant group for the release of a
garden manager in Assam.
The other tea companies owning gardens in Assam are also paying regularly to
the extremists to buy peace. But unlike Goodricke they are not ready to
admit it. That one company had paid Rs20m to the Bodo Security Force - an
outlawed organisation representing the Bodo tribal group - to save the life
of a kidnapped manager was revealed, much to the discomfiture of the
company, by the Assam government. The industry takes the state government's
action as a clear message that such deals should be struck to secure the
freedom of other kidnapped tea managers.
According to industry officials, the tea companies have been compelled to
make many secret deals with the BSF and the United Liberation Front of Assam
to protect the lives of their managers. They accept that the Assam
government is in no position to provide security to 688 tea estates spread
over 233,000 hectares (575,000 acres) but are anxious that it should not do
anything which might encourage the militants in their violent campaigns.
Following the killing of Mr Surrendra Paul, chairman of the Assam Frontier
group, in March 1989, the owners and senior officials of tea companies have
virtually stopped visiting the gardens, leaving the management to estate
officials. The managers of gardens deal directly with the militants. The
militants know exactly the quantity of tea produced by each garden and they
calculate their financial demands accordingly.
Some tea companies refuse to pay money to the militants, but they are
willing to undertake development work in the areas around the tea estates.
That was the response of Tata Tea, India's largest plantation company, when
the BSF asked it to pay Dollars 5m for the release of a manager who had been
taken hostage on April 8.
But the BSF does not seem to be in a mood to listen. In the last few years,
a number of garden managers, unable to cope with the pressures imposed by
the militants, have taken premature retirement. And finding replacement is
not easy. Industry officials admit that they are finding it increasingly
difficult to 'attract talents from outside the state'. So far the production
of tea in Assam has not been affected. But if the erosion of management
continues, then it will have a telling effect on the industry in the next
few years. Moreover, many tea companies are not spending enough for garden
development work because of the uneasy situation.
Besides being the largest employer in the state, the tea industry makes the
biggest contribution to the exchequer. Assam accounts for nearly half
India's tea production.
Management confidence will be restored to some extent, industry officials
believe, if the more vulnerable gardens in Darang, Borpeta and Sunitpur
districts where the BSF writ runs are provided with guards equipped with
modern arms. It has been tentatively agreed that while the Assam government
will raise and train the protection force, the cost of maintaining the force
will have to be largely borne by the industry. The government must ensure,
however, that the militants do not infiltrate the force.
The state government will take a few months to raise the force and post it
in the gardens. In the meantime, the industry will expect the state to seek
the assistance of the army to flush out the militants in the Bodo dominated
areas. Two army operations in 1991 did go a long way towards taming the ULFA
militants.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers mount effort
to boost prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN coffee producers, who account for almost two thirds of world
production, are to retain 20 per cent of their exports from the start of
October.
The move was agreed over the weekend in San Salvador, capital of El
Salvador. It follows the collapse in March of talks in London to renegotiate
the International Coffee Agreement, the producer/consumer price
stabilisation pact, which expires at the end of September.
Indonesia, the world's third biggest coffee producer, and some African
producers indicated yesterday that they might join the Latin American's
scheme. World producers are thought to have lost a cumulative Dollars 10bn
since the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system collapsed
in July 1989, more than halving world prices.
September robusta coffee futures on the London Commodities Exchange closed
up Dollars 24 yesterday at Dollars 952 a tonne. The New York arabica market
was closed for the Independence Day holiday. But last Friday September
arabica futures closed 2.45 cents higher at 62.25 cents a lb in anticipation
of the San Salvador meeting.
'I think the markets will begin to take us seriously now,' Mr Herbert de
Sola, El Salvador's top coffee negotiator, told the Reuter news agency after
the San Salvador meeting.
'This will have an immediate effect on prices. They have to believe that the
political commitment is there among producer nations, even if they question
how the agreement will function.'
The plan to retain 20 per cent of exports was proposed by Brazil, the
world's biggest producer. It supersedes an agreement made last May under
which the Central American producers - Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador
and Guatemala - were to withhold 15 per cent of their production while
Brazil and Colombia were to limit exports to 17m and 13m bags (60 kgs each)
respectively.
The countries meet again on August 15 as the Confederation of Coffee
Producing Countries, when they will work out the details of the scheme. It
will aim to reduce the level of exports retained as market prices rise.
London analysts expect the market to move ahead in the initial stages. 'I'm
quite positive about it,' said Mr Peter Kettle of ED &amp; F. Man, the London
trade house. 'I don't think producers have to do a large amount to turn it
around a bit.'
He argued that the producers were not seeking a huge increase in prices, but
were going for something fairly modest.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, put a
ceiling of 80 cents a lb for the nearby New York arabica contract on any
upward move. Above that level, he argued, consumers would resort to their
20m-bag stockpile and producers would start to circumvent the retention
scheme.
'The problem with the scheme is verification,' he suggested. 'Who is going
to determine the crop size? How do they know the volume of exports? What
happens if someone cheats?'

FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Green
shoots appear at Royal Agricultural show - Thanks to the pound's
devaluation, Britain's farm sector is faring better than was expected a year
ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S Royal Agricultural Show at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire should, if
everything had gone the way the politicians planned, have been a downbeat
affair. The European Community's common agricultural policy has been
reformed; EC commodity price guarantees have begun a three-year fall; and
the hated set-aside is a reality. Farmers and those who trade with them were
expecting the cuts to be biting hard by now.
But there was an accident last September. Sterling slipped out of the EC's
exchange rate mechanism and was devalued. As a result EC farm prices,
instead of falling, have risen in sterling terms. The consequent radical
devaluation of the 'green pound' has given most UK farmers a windfall.
At its lowest value last February the decline in the value of sterling,
which under EC law has to be made up to UK farmers, was equivalent to a
bonus of about 23 per cent. In other words those UK farm products which
enjoy EC price support have, at times, been that much more valuable than was
expected. And even though the pound's recent rally has reduced that
advantage most British farmers are still about 17 per cent better off than
they feared a year ago.
And when farmers have money they will spend it. UK tractors sales, for
instance, are, according to the Agricultural Engineers Association, up 17
per cent at 8,052 units for the first six months of this year compared with
the same period in 1992, which was, admittedly, a poor year. Nevertheless,
it is a welcome and unexpected improvement for which manufacturers are truly
thankful. On most of the farms to which they hoped to sell 15 per cent of
the land had been compulsorily set-aside, so they had little expectation of
such a lift in business.
Indeed long before such sales began to take place the biggest British
manufacturers had decided to pull out of the Royal Show because of the high
cost of mounting and manning exhibits and none of them now has its own stand
at the show. It has been left to JCB for instance with its new Fastrac range
of tractors but modest production potential to take up some of the
prestigious stand space once occupied by Ford. And even Massey Ferguson,
whose factory is just down the road from the show ground, in Coventry, has
declined to exhibit this year.
This departure of major companies has left big holes across the 280 acre
show ground. The organisers describe the spacious effect, with tongue in
cheek perhaps, as 'more user friendly' for visitors.
One theme of the show is 'producing for the market', in recognition of UK
farmers continuing reputation for being bad at marketing their produce. The
existence, for almost 50 years, of guaranteed marketing schemes and prices
has left the industry short of marketing expertise or even incentive. But
now that those props are being progressively removed a steep learning curve
is needed for survival.
The point was taken up by both Mrs Gillian Shephard, the minister of
agriculture, and Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union,
during their visits. The agricultural industry, said Mr Naish, must get its
marketing act together in anticipation of a deal being reached in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'If we do not we run the risk that
the Dutch, the Danes and the French will grab even more of the British food
market.'
The minister, just a month into her new job, declared that taking
initiatives to encourage better marketing and promotion of farm products,
together with maintaining the consumers' confidence in quality and safety
throughout the food chain were among her priorities for the next few years.
She went on to say that as a result of her policies she hoped the country's
food trade gap, at present about Pounds 6bn a year, would be reduced
considerably by the end of the century.
But there is a long way to go. Mrs Shephard's own boffins in the
Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, the ministry's advisory arm,
recently concluded that there was a widespread inability among UK farmers to
meet the needs of food industry buyers or to understand the business
pressures they were facing; and an 'us against them' attitude among farmers
and growers towards retailers and manufacturers.
That must be corrected, the minister said. For the prosperity of agriculture
was vital to Britain. Four fifths of the UK was farmland; while the farming
and food industries together accounted for 9 per cent of GDP and 14 per cent
of all jobs.
The farmers' stock reply is that they have been losing out to the food trade
over recent years. While the UK consumer spend on food has increased from
Pounds 32bn to Pounds 70bn since 1982, the value of agricultural output has
gone up only from Pounds 10.5bn to Pounds 12bn. The obvious implication is
that the supermarkets have pocketed the difference.
The truth is not quite that simple of course but such figures have added to
the antipathy between some sectors of the food trade and their actual or
potential suppliers.
But at least the food giants are now making a move towards farmers, if their
presence at the Royal Show is a fair indication.
Safeway, which has been a regular exhibitor for some years, is at the show
in strength on its own stand and sponsoring others; Marks &amp; Spencer has
returned after an absence of several years with the declared objective of
getting closer to its suppliers and customers; and both Tesco and Northern
Foods are also exhibiting, although the latter is probably there mainly to
try to persuade more dairy farmers to join the Northern Foods Partnership
and supply it with milk after the imminent demise of the Milk Marketing
Board.
Nevertheless, their presence marks real progress towards the generally
accepted goal of supplying more British food to British consumers.

INDIA MAY resume wheat exports this year following a rich harvest of 180.3m
tonnes of foodgrains last year, leading to a record procurement of wheat and
rice by government agencies, and the excellent progress so far of this
year's south-west monsoon
Last year the country imported 3m tonnes of wheat from the US, Canada and
Australia for distribution through ration shops.
While the food ministry is campaigning for the resumption of wheat exports,
the federal government wants to watch the situation for a little longer
before taking a decision. In the meantime, India will be exporting wheat
products like flour.
There is no doubt, however, that India will be making attempts to step up
exports of basmati, a fine long grain variety of rice, and of non-basmati
rice. The minimum export price for basmati rice is Dollars 555 a tonne and
for non-basmati Dollars 275 a tonne.
India's rice production is expected to go up to 78m tonnes in 1993-94 from
71.9m tonnes last year, creating adequate surplus for export. According to
one estimate, Indian rice exports can rise to Rs15bn this year from about
Rs10bn last year.
A boost will also be given to the export of pulses, the minimum price for
which is Dollars 400 a tonne.

GOLD closed lower on the London bullion market after initial support from
European investor buying was capped by producer selling. Dealers still saw
the recent rally carrying the yellow metal through the psychologically
significant Dollars 400 a troy ounce. But technical analysts expect
significant resistance at that level. COPPER prices closed higher on the
LME, while other metals closed mixed after a largely lacklustre day. Dealers
said there was little market-moving news and, with the US market closed for
Independence Day, the LME lacked interest for long periods.

THE EUROPEAN Court of Justice has dismissed an attempt by the Chiquita
Banana Company and subsidiaries to declare the new EC import regime for
bananas null and void, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Spiers, Bruigom and Viser, August Lehmann, Simba and Comaco lost similar
cases.
But some banana operators could get compensation for commercial loss caused
by the new rules, the court said. This will not be available until the
Luxembourg-based court issues a full ruling on the regime, which could take
two years.
The new regime, which imposes a 2m-tonnes a year tariff quota on imports of
Latin American bananas, came into force on July 1 after the court rejected a
German challenge.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Phillips seeks extension of
Ekofisk licence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PHILLIPS PETROLEUM Norway is to seek an extension of its licence for the
giant Norwegian North Sea Ekofisk field, hub of the world's largest
petroleum transportation system, before committing itself to a plan calling
for investment of Dollars 4bn to build new facilities.
The Ekofisk licence, of which Phillips is the operator with a 36.96 per cent
stake, is due to expire in the year 2011, but the plan envisages production
until 2040.
Phillips announced recently that it is considering a comprehensive plan to
extend the economic life and enhance the value of the field by installing
new facilities, to be called Ekofisk II, outside an area which is plagued by
an annual rate of subsidence of 35 centimetres.
Concerned over safety at Ekofisk, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the
oil industry watchdog, last October warned Phillips it would close the main
processing and transportation facilities at the field's storage tank,
through which 40 per cent of Norway's petroleum production passes, by the
winter of 1995-96.
The NPD said ageing technical equipment combined with inadequate maintenance
were the main causes of concern over Ekofisk and ordered Phillips to submit
a plan by July to remedy the problems. Phillips believes Ekofisk still
contains 1bn barrels of extractable reserves.
Industry officials say Phillips aims to undertake the Ekofisk II project
without having to seek outside financing, which would put a heavy burden on
the cash-strapped company. That is also the reason that will be seeking
substantial tax concessions for the project.
'The battle over Ekofisk II will not be fought over the technical solutions,
but over redistribution of ownership of the field and the extension of the
licence,' officials said.
Phillips said it did not anticipate problems in securing financing for the
project. A detailed commercial and definitive technical plan for Ekofisk II
will be submitted to Norwegian authorities by the end of the year, for which
the company hopes to gain approval by parliament during spring 1994 to meet
a planned target of 1998 for start-up.
Phillips is also expected to deploy the most advanced technology available
for Ekofisk II in which remotely-operated, unmanned platforms may be built
in order to eliminate as many as possible of the 2,000 offshore jobs at the
field, and thus reduce costs significantly.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway unveils reorganisation
of gas sales policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY HAS unveiled details of a reorganisation of its gas sales system
designed to give foreign oil companies greater influence over their natural
gas reserves and to facilitate more efficient gas resource management.
From August the foreign companies will be represented in two-year rotations
on a supply committee augmenting the existing Gas Negotiating Committee,
comprised of the three Norwegian oil companies.
Gas sales administration has hitherto been conducted solely by the GFU,
comprising Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum.
Under the new plan, Statoil, providing the secretariat and chairman, will
lead the supply committee, which will include Hydro and Saga and foreign oil
companies Total, Norske Shell, Conoco, Elf Aquitaine, Esso, Phillips
Petroleum and Neste Petroleum. It will take over GFU's role as adviser to
the Ministry of Industry and Energy on the disposition of gas reserves and
will advise the ministry on the development and utilisation of gas pipeline
infrastructure and production capacity.
'The decision to establish a separate supply committee was taken by the
Ministry of Industry and Energy in order to put greater emphasis on upstream
issues and gain broader planning of supplies before the GFU starts sales
talks,' Statoil explained.
The foreign oil companies will be selected for two-year terms on the basis
of their operatorships of licences.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Gilt-to-bund yield spread dips below 100
basis points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE and rise of UK government bonds continued yesterday, tightening the
yield differential over German bunds to below 100 basis points from around
110 according to some models. The narrower yield spread highlights the
tendency of overseas investors to see the UK as offering consistent value
and potential.
There were gains along the whole length of the yield curve, with the
strengthening belief that inflation is not going to move higher - which
helps longer dated maturities - competing with hopes for a cut in UK
interest rates.
The enthusiasm of overseas investors, who have poured an estimated Pounds
5.5bn into the UK government bond market since the start of the year, was
reflected in the sprightly performance of 10-year gilts. Ten-year issues are
the preferred overseas investment vehicle because most countries, apart from
the US, have 10-year maturities as their long-dated benchmark bond.
US investment house JP Morgan calculates that the yield spread between UK
and German 10-year benchmarks has fallen to 102 basis points but Mr Ian
Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets, comparing the UK 8 per cent stock
dated 2003 with Germany's 6.5 per cent 2003 stock, said the spread had
reached 94.
'Our forecast is for the spread to hit 50 basis points by the end of the
year. That compares with forecasts of around 300 basis points after
devaluation last year when inflationary prospects were much worse,' he said.
Yesterday's gains came despite mixed economic data. The consumer credit bill
for May was only Pounds 118m, well below a market forecast of around Pounds
150m. It pointed to a continuing slide in consumer spending and added to
concerns that the much vaunted green shoots are withering on the vine.
The trend bolsters the need for an interest rate cut and consequently helps
short-dated issues.
However, it does not offer a great deal of encouragement to sterling, the
strength of which has been one of the big incentives for the overseas
investor.
ITALIAN government bonds leapt forward yesterday as the market anticipated a
one-point cut in the discount rate following news of a successful labour
agreement.
The government, the Confederation of Italian Industry and unions agreed a
four-year national contract on Saturday which cut away some of the country's
high wage pressure and consequent inflationary implications.
The September BTP futures contract opened half a point higher yesterday and
then shot forward to break through 104. There was some profit-taking in
mid-afternoon but the contract recovered on the announcement that the Bank
of Italy had cut its discount rate by one point to 9 per cent, its lowest
level since 1976. By the close, the BTP future was some 60 basis points
higher at 104.10
FRENCH government bonds drifted back, having already taken on board the
intervention rate cut which became effective yesterday.
The 25 basis points cut to 6.75 per cent was widely flagged after Germany's
half-point discount rate cut on Thursday and brings the two key floor rates
back to parity. On the Matif, September futures fell back 18 basis points to
119.10 by the official close and recovered slightly in after-hours trading.
The yield spread between French and German 10-year issues remained in single
figures.
DUTCH bonds fell after an idle, consistently weak session, with the market
stuck in post rate-cut doldrums and drifting further as hopes faded for any
further rate falls.
The benchmark 6.50 per cent 10-year guilder bond fell 0.35 to 99.45 with the
yield up 5 basis points at 6.57 per cent. Dutch paper fell further than its
easier German counterpart, narrowing the Dutch yield discount to Germany by
3 basis points to 14.
PORTUGUESE debt prices rose after the Bank of Portugal cut its regular money
market intervention rate by 0.25 points to 10.25 per cent and its short-term
lending rate by the same amount to 11.25 per cent.
The move follows the introduction of a new 10-year bond which puts the
Portuguese debt market on a par with its EC counterparts. Last week, the
central bank issued Es10bn of 11.5 per cent stock dated July 2003. The issue
was aggressively bid with Es82.7bn of offers and an accepted yield of 10.67
per cent against expectations of 11 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied sharply, receiving a boost from weak US
employment data and a low bank lending figure. The low corporate demand for
loans raised hopes that banks might be looking to shift funds into bonds.
The yield on the JGB No 145 fell 5 basis points to 4.31 per cent in Tokyo
trading and continued lower in London to 4.30 per cent by the close.
THE US Treasury market was closed for Independence Day but Canadian bonds
climbed across the board in trade kept quiet by the US holiday.

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Austria's OKB launches aggressively
priced Eurolira offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROLIRA issues were again the centre of attention in the international bond
market as Osterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB), the Austrian state-backed
financial institution, yesterday launched an aggressive L250bn, 10-year
deal.
OKB is the second borrower in two trading days to launch a deal with a
coupon below the psychologically-important 10 per cent level. Investors  -
in particular, retail investors in the Benelux countries and Switzerland -
have been piling into the Eurolira market in recent months, attracted by the
double-digit coupons and high yields available.
On Friday the EBRD (which is another triple-A rated name) launched a L200bn,
seven-year bond, carrying a 9.75 per cent coupon and yielding 9.75 per cent
at launch. However, OKB's deal carries an even lower coupon - of 9.5 per
cent - and yielded 9.56 per cent at full fees.
Dealers criticised OKB's issue for being 'extremely aggressive', pointing
out that the EBRD issue, which has a shorter maturity, yields more than
OKB's deal even though the Italian yield curve is positive and gives a 20
basis points pick-up at the 10-year maturity over the seven-year maturity.
One dealer drew attention to two World Bank deals, which also mature in 2003
and which are yielding between 9.6 and 9.7 per cent in the secondary market.
OKB's issue traded at 99.60 - 99.70 yesterday: in other words, it was
'outside fees' or below 99.625 on the bid side for much of the day, although
it picked up later as the market rallied on the back of the Bank of Italy's
interest rate cut.
Paribas Capital Markets, the lead manager, admitted the deal was aggressive
but said there was good demand for 10-year Eurolira issues with current
coupons and good liquidity, particularly from investors looking for triple-A
rated names.
The issue was thought to have been swapped into D-Marks to give funding of
at least 30 basis points below London interbank offered rate.
The other main feature of the day was a Dollars 480m, four-year bond with
warrants issue from Seino Transportation, the large Japanese freight
company. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes, according to
Nomura, the lead manager. The issue was watched with some interest, given
that several Japanese borrowers - including Mitsubishi Oil, NGK Insulators
and Sumitomo Cement - are lined up to launch bonds with warrants over the
next few weeks.
However, Seino Transportation's deal was seen as moving slowly and dealers
said some investors were likely to wait until after the election before
taking a view on the Japanese market. 'This would have gone better a few
weeks ago, before the election was announced,' complained one dealer.
The bonds were pretty stable at 98.5 - or within fees - yesterday, while the
warrants traded at 13.25.

listing

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EAST JAPAN Railway, one of the seven regional companies created in 1987 by
the break-up of Japan National Railways, the former national operator,
yesterday applied to the Tokyo stock exchange for listing in late October.
The share sale was initially scheduled for last year, but the plunge in the
Tokyo stock market last August forced the government to postpone the
offering for the first tranche.
The aim is to ease the mounting debt at JNR Settlement Corp to which the
debts of JNR were transferred. JNR Settlement holds the shares in the six
passenger companies and one freight company.
The success of JR East's listing is crucial for other semi-privatised
companies, such as Japan Tobacco, and the remaining six JNR spin-offs. The
government also still holds 65.7 per cent of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
the telecommunications giant privatised in 1986.
The sale was welcomed by the country's brokers, who hoped the sale of a
low-priced stock would bring back retail investors, discouraged by the slump
in share prices and the plunge in NTT shares over the past three years.
Half of JR East's 4m shares, with a face value of Y50,000, are scheduled to
be offered in the first tranche. A total of 600,000 will be auctioned in
August to institutional investors to determine the initial offering price.
When the offering price has been fixed, the Tokyo stock exchange will accept
orders from individual investors from September to late October.

BCE, Canada's biggest telecom group, denies it is negotiating the sale of
its financial services subsidiary, Montreal Trust, but analysts still think
a deal is possible.
BCE paid CDollars 878m for Montreal Trust in 1989 in the last of its
diversification moves. It has since reversed its diversification policy,
selling assets outside the telecommunications field and reinvesting in its
core businesses.
The reports claimed it has been negotiating to sell Montreal Trust to either
Bank of Novia Scotia or Bank of Montreal, which are trying to expand in the
trust company field. Since 1992 banks can now own trust companies.
Montreal Trust and a property subsidiary are the only non-telecom assets
remaining in BCE's portfolio.
BCE, meanwhile, has appointed Mr Derek Davies, formerly Northern Telecom's
vice-president of corporate strategy, its senior vice-president of corporate
strategy - a newly-created position.
Mr Charles Labarge, former president and chief executive of BCE unit BCE
Telecom International Inc, has been named vice-president, corporate services
of BCE. Mr Derek Burney, current chairman of BCE Telecom International, will
replace Mr Labarge as its president and chief executive.

LAFARGE Coppee, the French building materials group, has increased its stake
in Asland, the Spanish cement and concrete maker, to 87.3 per cent following
an exchange offer it called a 'large success,' AP-DJ reports from Paris.
As a result of its exchange offer, Lafarge Coppee issued to Asland
shareholders participating in the swap a total of 3.42m new shares
representing 5.8 per cent of the share capital in the French group.
In April, Lafarge Coppee announced it would make a bid for the 46 per cent
of Asland it did not already own by swapping two of its new shares for every
nine existing Asland shares.
Lafarge Coppee noted that its operation was the first such exchange offer by
an international group for a Spanish-listed company. It said the acquisition
underscored its long-term confidence in Spain.
In 1992 Asland, which employs 1,800 people, posted consolidated revenues of
Pta42.8bn (Dollars 330m). Asland also holds minority stakes in companies in
Turkey and Morocco.
Lafarge Coppee shares will begin listing on the Madrid and Barcelona bourses
on Friday.

DEL MONTE Royal Foods (Delfood), which acquired the European food group Del
Monte Foods International (DMFI) for R2.3bn in December 1992, reports
attributable earnings of R82.2m (Dollars 24.7m) for the six months to May
28.
Comparable figures have not been provided owing to the re-organisation of
Delfood's operations following the DMFI deal, but management is confident
Delfood will achieve its forecast earnings of 60.1 cents a share for this
financial year.
Turnover at R651.3m was behind budget, but the maintenance of margins, lower
finance charges and tight control of working capital and expenses allowed
budgeted earnings to be achieved.
The company is paying a dividend of 8 cents per share.
DMFI is the principal operating subsidiary of Delfood, which also has food
investments in South Africa.
Markets for the group's products generally softened in both areas during the
reporting period.
DMFI managed to maintain market share, while in South Africa a difficult
operating environment was partially countered by the strong performance of
traditional brands and the successful launch of Mars products.
The share placing necessary to finance the DMFI transaction has
significantly changed the group's balance sheet. Ordinary shareholders'
funds have increased to R2.36bn from R204m, while the debt equity ratio of
17.8 per cent compares with 46.9 per cent before the takeover.
Management expects that trading conditions in its main European markets will
remain difficult for the rest of the year, while South African prospects
depend on 'political progress, improving business confidence and consumer
demand'.

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Randgold finds mixed results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE four gold mines in South Africa's Randgold group reported mixed fortunes
for the June quarter, with improved performances at Blyvooruitzicht and
Harmony being offset by losses at Durban Deep and ERPM.
All the mines benefited from the recent strength in the gold price. But they
did not reap the full benefit because most had hedged a 'significant
portion' of production at prices lower than the prevailing spot price. These
lower prices are locked in for as much as a further 12 months.
The most disappointing performance came from Durban Deep, which reported an
after-tax loss of R2.2m (Dollars 660,000) against a R0.5m profit in the
March quarter. Management warned that if margins were not restored 'the
future of operations will have to be reviewed'.
ERPM made a R18.4m loss, up from R13.7m last time. The mine, which has a
large debt burden, suffered an unexpected decline in the underground yield -
to 5.17 grammes per tonne from 5.54 g/t - which resulted in lower gold
production.
Management said the loss for the quarter had raised the possibility of a
funding problem towards the end of the year. The review of the mining and
finance plan is thus still in progress.
Harmony recorded a R1.3m after-tax profit, following a R0.4m loss in March,
while Blyvooruitzicht lifted profits to R5.6m from R3.1m a year ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S biggest-selling newspaper, La Prensa, is about to be sold for
Dollars 90m to a group of investors led by Mr Carlos Abedrop, a wealthy
Mexican businessmen, and Mr Jesus de Polanco, Spain's most powerful media
baron.
Mr Abedrop, a shareholder in Mexicana and Aeromexico, the country's two
largest airlines, is head of the investor group, and expects the purchase to
be completed in a few weeks.
Mr de Polanco, who will be investing through his publishing house Editorial
Santillana, will take a significant minority stake.
La Prensa is a downmarket newspaper with a circulation of up to 280,000, and
is owned by several hundred shareholders. The newspaper also owns several
publishing companies, that together print more books than any other Mexican
company.
La Prensa already prints Mexico's school textbooks on contract for Editorial
Santillana, the largest publisher of textbooks in Spanish, with sales
throughout Latin America.
Mr de Polanco also owns, through other holding companies, El Pais, Spain's
largest newspaper, radio stations, book shops, a television channel, and a
significant minority stake in Britain's Independent newspaper.
When the purchase of La Prensa is complete Mr de Polanco is expected to
concentrate on the publishing rather than newspaper side of La Prensa.
Mr Abedrop has said his only interest in La Prensa is commercial, and will
not change the newspaper's pro-government, sensationalist editorial line.
However, Mr Abedrop has never before shown any interest in newspapers,
leading some to suspect his investment is politically motivated.
'He has bought the paper as an instrument of political control to protect
his business interests,' says Mr Raymundo Riva Palacio, an editor of El
Financiero newspaper.
The sale of La Prensa comes as El Norte, the Monterrey-based newspaper, is
forging ahead with Dollars 50m investment in producing a new Mexico City
newspaper, even though Dow Jones, the parent company of the Wall Street
Journal, has backed down from taking a 49 per cent equity inter-est.
El Norte says the two sides are still talking about a 'strategic alliance in
both print and electronic form', but Dow Jones's stake will be much less
ambitious than originally planned.

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc sets Roussel price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, France's flagship state-controlled chemicals company,
yesterday announced it was selling its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf,
the specialist chemicals concern, for FFr563 a share. The deal values the
holding at FFr4.39bn (Dollars 770m), writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The sale - intended to raise capital to reduce Rhone-Poulenc's debt before
the French government's privatisation programme gets under way in the autumn
 -has been divided into a public offer of nearly 3.9m shares in France and
an international placing of some 3.9m shares. Some 15 per cent of the
international allocation can be clawed back for French investors.
Roussel's shares were suspended at FFr575 two weeks ago on the day the deal
was announced. The price of the transaction is in line with market
expectations. Rhone-Poulenc's own share price yesterday fell FFr14 to FFr571
following the announcement.
The sale of the Rhone-Poulenc stake has been expected for some time. The
French group acquired the holding in Roussel, best known for its
controversial RU-486 abortion pill, in 1990, when France's then socialist
government reshuffled its chemicals interests.
However, Rhone-Poulenc is now pursuing a strategy of shedding peripheral
interests - a category into which most of Roussel's activities fall - and
also concentrating on companies where it exercises control. Roussel is
controlled by Hoechst, the powerful German chemicals group which owns a 54.5
per cent stake. Rhone-Poulenc is also keen to reduce its net debt, valued at
FFr34bn (Dollars 5.96bn) at the end of last year.

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Reforms confuse investor
equation - Political factors make calculations tricky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE set yesterday by Rhone-Poulenc for the shares it owns in
Roussel-Uclaf sets a tricky problem for investors.
At FFr563 per share, the price is a little below the all-time peak of
FFr575, but nonetheless up 30 per cent since January. Investors must decide
whether the price for France's third-largest pharmaceuticals group is fair.
The decision by Rhone-Poulenc to sell its 35 per cent stake should improve
both liquidity and investor interest in Roussel. Hoechst, the German group,
controls 54.5 per cent of Roussel, which last year generated pre-tax profits
of FFr722m (Dollars 126.66m) on sales of FFr14.812bn.
Roussel, whose operations involve pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals,
agrochemicals and veterinary products, has been lightly followed by the
investment community. Only 0.5 per cent of shares were quoted.
Analysts' calculations have been complicated by the increasingly stormy
environment for the drugs industry. All pharmaceuticals groups are
struggling after a series of government cost-containment measures which are
reducing sales volumes and prices around the globe.
In Europe, for example, during the first four months this year, sales in the
top seven drugs markets increased only 1.4 per cent, according to IMS
International, the specialist market research company.
The industry is likely to be further destabilised by reforms in the US, the
world's biggest market, and France, the third-largest.
The US reforms represent the industry's most significant worry, but any
changes announced by President Bill Clinton are likely to have a minimal
impact on Roussel, says Mr Edouard Sakiz, the group's president. He says 4
per cent of healthcare's FFr8.5bn sales are in North America.
Meanwhile, the German reforms introduced in January have hit the company,
admits Mr Sakiz. Broker JP Morgan, which is advising during the sale,
estimates about 4 per cent of drugs sales are in Germany.
In contrast, the healthcare reforms in Italy, where Roussel-Uclaf generates
about 12 per cent of its turnover, have hit both turnover and profitability,
admits Mr Sakiz. However, he says cost-reduction measures should allow it to
achieve the same profits next year as last.
But it is in France, where 37 per cent of Roussel's healthcare sales are
located, that the company is probably most vulnerable to reforms.
Since the sale was announced, the French government has revealed a
healthcare package designed to save FFr32. bn. The first stage includes a
decision to cut the amount the government reimburses patients for their
medicines.
Mr Sakiz promises the group will generate sales growth of between 5 and 8
per cent this year, in spite of healthcare reforms. JP Morgan predicts the
group will generate earnings of FFr908m this year, FFr1.04bn next year,
FFr1.2bn in 1995, and FFr1.38bn in 1996.
The growth will not be generated by Roussel's best-known product, its
controversial abortion pill, RU-486. Mr Sakiz says the product will never be
a money-spinner as an abortion treatment.
He does not want the company to make money out of abortions and, besides,
the potential market is small. The treatment could be used for other uses,
however, such as during labour and for breast cancer.
Rather, the therapeutic areas that will drive growth will include
antibiotics. Mr Sakiz stresses the innovative nature of Roussel's products
and its pipeline in development in antibiotics, cardiovascular and
endocrinology.
Earnings growth will also be helped by the group's efforts to cut costs. A
rationalisation programme launched in 1988 is 80 per cent complete and
should end in 1995. The company believes it should contribute pre-tax
savings of FFr500m a year from 1995 onwards.
Investors' difficulties in valuing the company are exacerbated by changes in
the group's structure. Roussel is acquiring Hoechst's French and German
pharmaceuticals sales operations. The two companies' Italian and British
businesses may also be merged.

magazine

<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch is negotiating the purchase of a substantial shareholding
in Better Life, a Shanghai-based lifestyle magazine.
According to the Chinese official Business Weekly newspaper, News
Corporation - Mr Murdoch's master company - is discussing the purchase with
China's State media and publication administration.
Mr Hu Xiaosheng, editor-in-chief of Better Life, told the paper Mr Murdoch's
bid was 'highly likely' to be given the go-ahead, but that the Chinese
government would probably insist on retaining 51 per cent to ensure control
over editorial policy.
The Chinese government has recently loosened its grip on magazines and
newspapers. Should the talks prove successful, Mr Murdoch would become one
of the few foreign joint venture partners in the Chinese media.
A successful bid for Better Life could serve to ease disappointment over
problems Mr Murdoch faces with a HKDollars 1.85bn (USDollars 239m) bid for
22 per cent of Television Broadcasts of Hong Kong. The bid has met stiff
resistance both in Hong Kong and China.
Officials maintain that a large foreign holding in the Hong Kong TV station
could lead to erosion of local content and flavour. Mr Murdoch already
controls Hong Kong's top English-language newspaper and a large
Chinese-language daily in the colony.
Economic reform in China has brought with it an explosion of popular
tabloid-style newspapers and magazines, though they remain subject to
scrutiny by the Communist party's propaganda department.
With 800 new publications approved by March this year, China now has around
1,700 daily newspapers and about 7,000 periodicals.
Circulation of such stalwart party organs as the People's Daily have been
falling rapidly in recent years.

RUHRGAS, western Germany's leading natural gas importer and distributor,
started feeling the impact of the domestic recession this year as first-half
sales dropped by DM600m to DM6.3bn (Dollars 3.72bn).
In volume terms, gas deliveries fell 1.4 per cent for the six months to
290.5bnkWh.
The company, whose shareholders include Bergmann, a mining and machinery
group with 35 per cent, the German subsidiary of British Petroleum with 25
per cent and Brigitta Erdgas und Erdo, Germany's largest natural gas
producer, also with 25 per cent, said the drop in sales stemmed mostly from
a fall in the industrial use of gas because of the slowdown in the German
economy.
Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the board, said he remained confident that
sales for the year would reach their 1992 level.

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amic, Daewoo establish white
goods joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO AMERICAN Industrial Corporation (Amic) of South Africa and the South
Korean Daewoo group have established a 50-50 joint venture to manufacture
high-value consumer goods and exploit international technology markets.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman of Amic, the industrial arm of the Anglo American
group, said the deal with Daewoo was part of Amic's strategy to reduce its
dependence on cyclical commodity markets.
The alliance with an Asian partner is an important one for Anglo, which has
traditionally found its partners in Europe.
Daewoo-Amic, the new company, will make an initial investment of about R20m
(Dollars 6m) to take a 29.99 per cent stake in Gentech, a company that
manufactures and distributes household electrical appliances. The basis for
the venture includes growth potential in the southern African white goods
market and Daewoo's extensive technology base and exposure to consumer
durables.
The establishment by the new company of a local colour picture tube (CPT)
manufacturing facility for televisions is also being considered.
Giving the reasons for the Daewoo tie-up, Mr Boyd said Amic needed Daewoo's
specific technology and international marketing skills to establish itself
'boldly in downstream consumer industries'.
Daewoo saw South Africa as a developing consumer market, and needed Anglo's
financial partnership and operating skills.
South African companies suffered during the sanctions era from the lack of
transfer of technology. Anglo often said it was seeking joint venture
partners.
Part of Amic's reason for seeking a Korean partner was the idea that Korean
investors were more willing to accept the risks of the South African
environment than US, Japanese or European investors.
Korea is also felt to be better attuned to the needs of developing

methods without sacrificing international competitiveness.
Altech, Amic's electronics associate, has a tie-up with the French group,

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: More job cuts at Groupe Bull
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GROUPE BULL, the troubled French computer company, plans to cut its
worldwide workforce by 6,500 by the end of next year in the hope of
returning to profit in 1995.
The bulk of the job losses, which involve reducing Bull's 35,175 workforce
by 18 per cent, will come from operations outside France. Bull, a
state-controlled company targeted for privatisation by the new centre-right
government, plans to cut its domestic workforce by 2,850 from the present
level of 13,600.
Bull said the cuts would come 'across the board in every country and in
every area of activity including research, manufacturing and marketing'. It
has already implemented more than 1,000 of the 6,500 job losses since the
beginning of this year.
The latest round of rationalisation follows years of cost-cutting by Bull,
which has been hit badly by the difficulties of the international computer
industry. The group has shed staff steadily since 1988, when its worldwide
workforce peaked at 45,500.
However, the cuts have failed to resolve Bull's financial problems. It
recently reported a net loss of FFr4.7bn (Dollars 820m) for 1992, after
losing FFr3.3bn in 1991 and FFr6.8bn in 1990. The group's financial
condition is so precarious that analysts were shocked to see its inclusion
in the government's list of privatisation candidates. Bull is seen as one of
the longer term contenders for sale to the private sector.
Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, has made clear that the new government
will take a tough line on lossmaking state companies, such as Bull. He
recently said he expected Bull to stem its losses, and warned he would be
much more stringent about injecting new capital than his predecessors.
Bull said it hoped to return to the black 'as soon as possible', and that
break-even by 1995 was the present target.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The escape from bad debt mountain - John
Gapper examines new operations set up by TSB and Royal Bank to remove a
menace from their balance sheets and promote a rescue culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BRITISH banks show signs of emerging into a fresh era of profitability,
they are still weighed down by their past.
A mass of corporate debt from the 1980s held by companies that have stopped
paying interest, or defaulted on the capital, loiters menacingly on their
balance sheets.
Little wonder that most prefer to avoid the subject of bad debt, instead
emphasising steps they are taking to re-shape, and develop new fee-earning
operations.
Yet as they do so, they face the danger that they will fail to devote enough
attention to managing the problems of the past.
In the US, some banks have opted for two radical solutions to such
difficulties.
The first is to split in two, creating a 'bad bank' to carry old bad debt,
and a 'good bank' which can trade unburdened. The second solution is to sell
the old poor loans at a heavy discount on secondary loan markets.
But in Britain, no bank has yet chosen to split itself, and the secondary
debt market is less developed. This means many banks are simply struggling
along with increasingly divided businesses.
Two banks ' TSB Group and Royal Bank of Scotland - have set up new
operations in response.
TSB Group's problems with poor corporate loans largely stem from its
misguided purchase of Hill Samuel, the merchant bank. Hill Samuel built up a
portfolio of bad loans in the late 1980s, and has now been put up for sale.
But TSB must still deal with the Pounds 1.6bn net debt burden.
To manage down this debt, it established a separate 'loan administration
unit' at the end of last year. Mr Mike Fairey, director of credit, says the
unit has two purposes. One is to 'relieve Hill Samuel of its debt mountain'
and allow its management to concentrate on re-shaping the business.
The second purpose is to allow 50 full-time managers in the unit ' supported
by specialists in areas such as property who advise under contract ' to
concentrate on the task. Mr Fairey argues that such concentration is
required because there is 'no generic approach' to getting rid of the debt.
Mr Fairey does not rule out selling debt, or securitising assets to remove
them from the balance sheet. But he believes it will only be possible in a
few cases. So the task in many cases comes down to selling the underlying
assets on which the loans were secured. This largely means property.
Signs of a revival of investor interest in the UK property market are
unlikely to have an immediate impact, because much of the old book is what
he terms 'secondary' property - not the sort of fully-let commercial
property on prime sites which attracts blue chip companies as tenants.
As a result, his properties need work to sell. 'You cannot manage property
from behind a desk. You have to get out there and have a look,' he says. The
bank has raised Pounds 60m from property sales since October, reducing net
written down debt - after making provisions of 54 per cent - to Pounds 747m.
On one hand, the bank has an incentive to rid itself of the property book
fast. Carrying the unit's loans cost Pounds 42m in interest last year. Yet
there is a risk that it could imitate the banks' mistake in selling less
developed country debt cheaply in the 1980s before it started performing
again.
'We want to get rid of it, but I believe we are adequately provided, and
there could be some potential in the future,' says Mr Fairey.
This means the bank is not trying to reclaim the underlying security in many
cases, but instead allowing managements to remain in place to make the best
of it.
Royal Bank of Scotland is also trying to keep as many of its troubled
corporate debtors trading as possible, although it is sometimes less keen to
keep current managers in place.
The bank established a 'specialised lending services' unit last year to deal
with many of the poor loans that led to it making Pounds 400m of bad debt
provisions in 1992. It is headed by Mr Derek Sach, who was formerly UK
managing director of 3i, the venture capital company owned by the big banks.
Rather than concentrating on liquidating the asset on which property is
secured, the unit's efforts are mostly aimed at restructuring debt and
making businesses more viable. It has deliberately intervened to make it
more difficult for branch managers to place small businesses in
receivership.
The number of receivers appointed by the bank in the first four months of
this year was 90, compared with 190 in the same period the previous year. Mr
Sach argues that branches have appointed receivers too fast because managers
want to spend their time on 'new, positive business' rather than old.
He is also trying to avoid 'the classic clearing banker approach' of
refusing further loans to companies that have eroded their capital during
recession. Yet this requires the bank to take some brave decisions based on
confidence that managements are capable of staying in business.
It attempts to do this by assigning teams of specialists, including
accountants and lawyers, to restructure both the terms of financing and
often management.
Mr Sach summarises his task within the bank as 'trying to promote a rescue
culture'. He says this will remain useful even when it has rid itself of its
current debt burden. It could then apply the equity finance and accountancy
skills among the 300 people in the unit for new lending.
Yet the development of such skills also poses the question of whether Royal
Bank might exercise them on other portfolios, by buying distressed debt from
others. It has not done so yet, but fellow bankers expect it to be among
bidders if a secondary loan market starts to develop in the UK.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 9m purchase for Rubicon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Rubicon Group, the maker of storage and handling systems for
retailers, put on 1p to 145p on the resumption of trading yesterday as the
company announced it had reached agreement for the acquisition of High Speed
Production (Holdings) for Pounds 9m.
The total consideration for the purchase will be satisfied by the issue of
3.28m shares, loan notes of Pounds 3.5m and Pounds 1.4m cash.
To satisfy the cash element and provide cash backing for the loan notes,
Rubicon proposes to raise Pounds 7m net of expenses via a rights issue of
6.36m shares at 120p on a 7-for-11 basis.
An extraordinary meeting has been called for July 26 to gain shareholder
approval for the proposals. HSP, which manufactures precision metal
components and assemblies, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.7m on turnover
of Pounds 20.1m in 1992. It will form a second operating division of
Rubicon.
The announcement came as the company reported a 48 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 820,000 to Pounds 1.22m, for the year to May
31.
The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 15m to Pounds 18.1m,
boosted by the acquisition of BFN in September last year. A second interim
dividend of 2.5p is declared making 4p (nil) for the year. The dividend is
more than twice covered by earnings of 8.4p (30.4p) per share, adjusted for
a capital reconstruction during the year.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Gardiner up to Pounds 1.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Gardiner Group, the distributor of security and
surveillance equipment, more than doubled from Pounds 839,000 to Pounds
1.85m in the six months to the end of April.
Mr Richard Clemons, chairman, said the period had been 'steady as you go' as
the new board had attempted to distance itself from the discovery last year
of, in the words of Price Waterhouse, which recently completed the
investigation, 'a deliberate overstatement' of Pounds 4.8m in Gardiner's
1991 accounts.
In the light of the 'overstatement' the interim dividend is halved at 0.23p
(0.47p) payable from earnings per share of 1.15p (0.54p). Gardiner shares
moved up 1 1/2 p to close at 26p.
Mr Clemons said the new board was in the process of adopting the Cadbury
principles and had formed both audit and remuneration committees.
The results, prepared under FRS 3, showed turnover up at Pounds 40.2m
(Pounds 36.6m), partly helped by exchange rate fluctuations. Turnover is
biased towards the first half.
Interest payments fell to Pounds 380,000 (Pounds 550,000) reflecting lower
UK interest rates and reduced borrowings. Gearing at the half-way stage
stood at 41 per cent compared with 47 per cent at the October year-end.
Mr Harvey Samson, chief executive, said turnover was strong at Gardiner
Security, the principal subsidiary, 'despite what are still difficult
economic conditions'.
Mr Clemons said: 'Tight control of costs and margins, together with the
strength of our position in the market, gives the board optimism for the
future.'
Gardiner operates subsidiaries in Denmark, Norway, France, the Netherlands
and Belgium.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: HunterPrint shares dip 5p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN HunterPrint fell 5p to 45p yesterday as the specialist printer
warned that, although the results for the year to September 1993 would
'reflect a marked improvement over the previous year', the group was
unlikely to climb back into the black.
The announcement constituted an update of the trading position described in
the interim statement. This followed the revelation last week that talks
with a possible bidder had ended inconclusively, prompting a 17p tumble in
the share price to 50p.
At the interim stage HunterPrint said that market conditions were difficult.
Now, the group has said that sales will fall below expectations - mostly
because start dates on new contracts recently won have been postponed and
because pagination and circulation on existing contracts have been at lower
levels.
As a result, the group said its revenues in the second half would be more
reliant than previously expected on 'a spot market that remains depressed'.
Also, the group has a number of surplus freehold properties and it is likely
to provide, as it did in 1990, for 'the continuing obligations of these
properties'.
This could further depress the current year's results.
In the six months to March 31, HunterPrint engineered a turnround from
pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.85m to profits of Pounds 330,000.
In December HunterPrint pushed through its second refinancing in two years.
This included a Pounds 20m placing and offer.

A meeting between directors of Securiguard and Rentokil ended yesterday
without the board of the security company making any recommendation
concerning the Pounds 70.9m final offer which the environmental and property
services company made for it on Friday.
Mr Clive Thompson, Rentokil's chief executive, said the future of
Securiguard's business had been discussed and both companies shared similar
views. A further meeting was expected to take place today. Mr Alan Baldwin,
chairman of Securiguard, said the statement issued by Rentokil on
yesterday's meeting had not been agreed and was premature.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce foreign holding breached
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine manufacturer, yesterday said non-UK
shareholders had taken their holdings above the permitted level. The
investors have been asked to relinquish their shares.
The level of the group's foreign ownership of its shares has risen to 30.19
per cent, breaching the 29.5 per cent permitted by the company's articles of
association. The limit was raised to its present level in 1989.
Rolls-Royce has asked foreign shareholders which bought shares since the
company said it had reached its maximum level last month to relinquish their
purchase by July 28. If they fail to do so their shares will be sold and the
proceeds returned.
Buying from overseas investors has underpinned the share price in recent
months. However, until the level of foreign shareholding is reduced below
the maximum permitted limit, it is likely that all new purchases of foreign
held shares presented for registration will be classified as excess.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove advances 35% to Pounds 7.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering
conglomerate, increased annual profits by 35 per cent and yesterday reported
that order books generally were improving.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.61m for the 12 months to March 31 compared with
Pounds 5.64m last time, restated for FRS 3. Fully diluted earnings per
share, however, were 0.8p lower at 7.75p on capital enlarged by the 1992
rights issue.
A recommended final dividend of 2.75p brings the total for the year to 4.4p
(4p).
The results reflected the acquisition in 1992 of Thornton, which led to a
near doubling of turnover in the aerospace division to Pounds 16.2m. Total
turnover was Pounds 110.9m against a restated Pounds 90.1m.
The aerospace division's operating profits rose proportionately and there
were increases also in the marine &amp; offshore, plastics and environmental
divisions. Operating profits were lower in the automotive and general
industrial divisions as the markets in continental Europe weakened.
Bromsgrove has grown steadily by acquisition in specialist engineering
markets but this stage of its development appears to be ending. Mr Bijan
Sedghi, chairman, said 'the range of activities is likely to become narrower
as we concentrate upon a specialist and carefully selected operational
portfolio which will form the basis of core activities.'
He added that some peripheral operations could be sold in a divestment
programme over the next three years.
Mr Sedghi was confident about the medium and longer term but said the short
term was 'still not easy to predict.' For all that, he noted that order
books were improving and drew attention to plans for expansion in the Far
East and the US.
'The economic conditions governing the markets in which we operate are
showing signs of gentle but gradual improvement,' he said.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ANS improves to Pounds 1.82m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Nursing Services, the nursing home specialist, announced pre-tax
profits improved from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.82m in the year to end-March.
Mr Nick Dhandsa, chief executive, said: 'The group continued to grow
profitably, particularly in its core nursing home business.' He said the
board proposed the resumption of dividends, passed since the 1991 interim,
with a payment of 1p for the year.
The company's decision not to comply with the new FRS 3 accounting standards
meant that a Pounds 1.05m charge in the 1992 figures remained below the
line.
ANS said it had not yet adopted FRS 3 as it had already been forced to
restate last year's figures to comply with the judgment of the Financial
Reporting Review Panel. In 1992 the Panel expressed concern over ANS's
capitalisation of interest costs on new homes for longer than the
three-month norm.
Profits were struck on turnover down to Pounds 17.8m compared with Pounds
18.5m last time, which included Pounds 3.44m from discontinued operations.
Administrative expenses fell to Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 4.23m) and interest
payments fell on the back of lower UK interest rates and reduced borrowings.
The company raised Pounds 1.54m in a placing and secured Business Enterprise
Scheme funding to operate 200 beds.
Earnings per share fell to 16.6p (19p) diluted by the placing.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cowie makes profit of Pounds 4.5m on sale
of 9.9% stake in Henlys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the motor trader, bus operator and car leasing group, has sold the
9.9 per cent stake it bought in Henlys Group when it bid for the motors, bus
and coach company a year ago. Cowie made a profit of about Pounds 4.5m on
the deal, compared with the Pounds 2.27m written down value of the stake.
The profit substantially exceeds the costs of the Pounds 32m bid, which
narrowly failed. The costs were put at Pounds 1.22m in Cowie's 1992
accounts, including the Pounds 511,000 cost of writing down the investment.
Mr Steven Lonsdale, Cowie's finance director, agreed yesterday that the sale
indicated Cowie had lost interest in Henlys. He said that since Cowie agreed
the Pounds 39.5m purchase of Keep Trust, the motor dealer subsidiary of
Fitzwilton, in April it had had its hands full.
He said the timing of the sale had nothing to do with Sir Tom Cowie's
decision to retire as chairman and his elevation to life president announced
last week.
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive of Henlys, said he had not felt threatened
by Cowie's stake but was pleased to 'see the matter brought to a
conclusion'. He said the stake had been placed by SG Warburg with five
institutions. It is thought that some are new investors while others are
already Henlys shareholders.
In the closing stages of the bid Cowie bought the stake paying an average of
73p a share. After the bid failed Henlys shares fell and Cowie wrote the
stake down to 60p a share.
Since then, though, Henlys shares have risen sharply, closing yesterday at
191p, up 2p. Cowie sold the 3.78m shares to Warburg at 181 1/2 p each,
raising Pounds 6.86m. Warburg is thought to have placed them at 183p each.
One analyst said yesterday that the share price performance since the bid
failed showed that Cowie had spotted that Henlys' shares had been
undervalued. There has also been a surge in the motors sector as car sales
have revived in recent months.
Cowie shares, which were 126p on the day the bid for Henlys failed, were
unchanged yesterday at 248p.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Coutts Consulting dividend plan thwarted by
ex-chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE by Coutts Consulting Group, formerly DC Gardner, to reduce its share
premium account in order to resume dividend payments was blocked yesterday
by Mr Barry Topple, the restructured outplacement group's disgruntled former
chief executive.
The restructuring follows the sale last month of the banking and management
training division to Euromoney Publications for Pounds 3.7m and the
termination of a costly long term lease on a property in Docklands.
The change would have restored reserves, paving the way for arrears of
Pounds 480,000 on its 5m convertible preference shares to be paid and
hastening the return of ordinary dividend payments.
However, the proposed Pounds 6.65m reduction in the share premium account
required the support of three quarters in nominal value of the issued
convertible stock. Mr Topple, who was replaced as chief executive of DC
Gardner in November, controls 70 per cent of convertible preference shares
and blocked the move.
Mr Topple has been in dispute with his former employer over compensation and
other matters and had issued a writ against the company claiming substantial
damages. The company, which had made a Pounds 150,000 provision in its
accounts to cover possible compensation costs, has issued a counter suit
claiming Pounds 3.4m in damages.
Sir Kit McMahon, Coutts chairman, said yesterday the two sides appeared to
have reached an agreement on a compensation package 'a little better' than
the Pounds 150,000 during negotiations 10 days ago.
However, the settlement was conditional upon Mr Topple supporting the
financial restructuring and he apparently changed his mind on Friday.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Great Portland scheme likely to be scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSIAL management agreement between Great Portland Estates, the
UK's sixth largest property company, and its chairman is likely to be
scrapped in the light of the Cadbury report on corporate governance.
At its next meeting, the board will discuss proposals to reform a
long-standing arrangement by which Great Portland pays management fees to a
company fully owned by Mr Richard Peskin, its chairman and chief executive.
'It is more than likely that we shall be changing it (the arrangement) in
some form or other,' said Mr Roger Payton, deputy chairman. 'I think it is
very likely that it has outlived its usefulness.'
In its last financial year, Great Portland paid Pounds 2.97m in management
fees to Basil &amp; Howard Samuel, a management agent owned by Mr Peskin that
solely acts for Great Portland.
Some institutional shareholders dislike the arrangement because it obscures
the size of Mr Peskin's pay package and could present a possible conflict of
interest.
The Pounds 2.97m fee paid to B&amp;HS by Great Portland, which has a rental
income of Pounds 83.8m, is at the top end of fees charged by managing
agents, which are normally in the range of 1 to 3.5 per cent of the rent
roll.
Great Portland said that the fees were 'in accordance with the scale of
professional charges laid down on 1 January 1963 by the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors'. However, the RICS abandoned the scale in 1982 at the
instigation of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and strongly
discourages companies from referring to it.
Mr Peskin, who is paid a direct salary of Pounds 33,000 by Great Portland,
declined to disclose how much income he draws from his management company.
The company is not obliged to disclose its income because it is classified
as a small company under the 1985 Companies Act.
The agreement between BH&amp;S and Great Portland has a 57 month notice period.
If the agreement is terminated for any reason, Great Portland has agreed to
pay Mr Peskin an additional salary, equal to his salary from B&amp;HS.
'There cannot be any advantages to shareholders of Great Portland Estates at
all in this arrangement,' said one analyst. 'I think this agreement is
unique.'
Although Great Portland has used this arrangement for the last 34 years, the
company may come under pressure to reform it because institutional
shareholders are starting to take a greater interest in the pay packages of
top executives.
Mr Payton's decision to raise the issue at the next board meeting stemmed
from the publication of the Cadbury Committee report last December.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Improved margins boost Carclo - Arthur Lee
acquisition should be earnings enhancing in first year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARCLO Engineering increased profits and earnings by 55 per cent last year,
helped by the devaluation of sterling and improved demand in the UK.
Mr John Ewart, chairman, said high gross margins on its products meant that
the increase in sales led to an immediate rise in bottom line profits.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 5.63m to Pounds
8.75m on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 84.4m. The 1991-92 results were held
back by a Pounds 1.17m exceptional charge.
Earnings per share rose from 9.6p to 14.9p and a recommended final dividend
of 3.4p raises the total by 10 per cent to an 8.6p.
On May 11 Carclo announced the agreed takeover of Arthur Lee, the
Sheffield-based maker of steel and plastics products, in which it already
had a 29.9 per cent stake.
Lee yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 600,000) in
the half year to March 31 on sales of Pounds 42m (Pounds 51.9m). The interim
dividend is 4p (1.65p).
Mr Ewart said the Pounds 55m acquisition of Arthur Lee would lead to savings
by bringing together the two companies' wire rope and steel purchasing
interests.
There would also be savings at Lee's head office. The acquisition should be
earnings enhancing in the first year.
Mr Ewart said sales from the card clothing division had increased with
increased demand from mills and original equipment manufacturers. Operating
profits rose from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 3.2m on sales up 27 per cent at
Pounds 20.5m.
Profits from the general engineering division rose from Pounds 1.98m to
Pounds 2.62m on sales up slightly at Pounds 24m, helped by the control cable
business and the bronze and aluminium component maker.
The wire division's profits rose 41 per cent to Pounds 1.9m on sales almost
unchanged and the group expects this area to be a significant beneficiary of
the merger.
Carclo said yesterday that its offer for Arthur Lee had been accepted by
holders of 21.7m shares, representing 91.7 per cent of Lee's capital. The
remaining shares would be compulsorily purchased.
Carclo shares rose 10p to close at 224p.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Goldsborough expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDSBOROUGH, the nursing home subsidiary of Kunick, the fruit machine
group, has paid Pounds 9.1m for Mariamark, which owns seven care homes with
a total of 300 beds.
The acquisition makes Goldsborough the fifth largest care homes operator in
the UK, with 26 homes and 1,200 beds.
Kunick sold a 50 per cent stake in Goldsborough to County Natwest Ventures
for Pounds 12.5m in October 1992, to reduce borrowings and raise money to
fund Goldsborough's expansion.
Goldsborough is hoping to achieve a Stock Exchange flotation in the next 12
months.

FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fyffes turns in 13.5% advance to
IPounds 14.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FYFFES, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable distributor, reported a 13.5
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 14.1m on turnover down 7.6
per cent to IPounds 267m for the six months to April 30 1993.
Interest and income from financial assets accounted for IPounds 6.6m of the
pre-tax figure.
The company said that sales volume increased in all its markets but turnover
fell 'due to the unusually low fruit prices experienced during this period.
In particular European banana prices were weak in the first six months in
the lead up to the new EC banana regime'.
Mr John Callaghan, chief executive, said the EC's new regime, which came
into effect last Thursday, would be likely to cause some market disruption
in the next couple of months.
There could be surplus bananas on the market in the opening months - the
last three months of Fyffes financial year - because fruit loaded before
June 23 could still be accepted in the EC after July 1.
'I believe it is a well-based system and will work well once the settling
down period has passed,' Mr Callaghan said.
Fyffes' traditional sources of supply from the ACP countries have been
supplemented in recent years by sources from dollar-producing areas to
supply the continental European market, and will benefit from the new quota
arrangements.
The company said that interest income would be lower in the second half of
the current year due to lower interest rates, and expects earnings per share
for the year to be 'not be materially greater than that of last year'.
Shareholders' funds stood at IPounds 187m with net cash balances of IPounds
91m at April 30. Earnings per share were 2.75p (2.23p). The interim dividend
is 0.3904p, 10 per cent up on last year.
Fyffes also announced it had acquires 50 per cent of Brdr Lembcke 'which
supplies about 25 per cent of the Danish fresh produce market'.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat in finance talks with Postel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT, the property group, is in talks with Postel Investment Management
about a financial restructuring.
An announcement about a Pounds 120m refinancing, which involves the
restructuring of Greycoat's debt and capital base, is expected today.
The announcement of restructuring talks prompted the preference shares to
rise from 34 1/2 p to 51 3/4 p, while the ordinary shares dipped from 20 3/4
p to 19 1/2 p.
Greycoat, which is heavily exposed to the central London office market, has
come under increasing financial pressure. Last September, it was forced it
to pass its preference dividend and rescind its recommendation to pay a
final dividend. In its half year to end-September, it incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 39.2m.
Without a restructuring, Greycoat's financial position would deteriorate
sharply over the next few years, as a result of its reliance on stepped
coupon bonds, on which interest payments rise as the bonds mature.
Postel, which manages the pension funds of the Post Office and British
Telecom, owns 5.38 per cent of Greycoat.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Creighton's improves 7% to Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of Creighton's Naturally, the USM-quoted creator and maker of
natural health and beauty products, rose from Pounds 934,000 to Pounds 1m
pre-tax for the year to end-March.
The shares responded via a 14p rise to 170p.
The 7 per cent profits improvement was scored in spite a fall in turnover to
Pounds 8.52m (Pounds 10.2m). The directors blamed the sales fall on the
depressed domestic market. However, expansion overseas resulted in exports
to the US exceeding Pounds 1m. More than of a quarter of group production is
now exported.
Earnings rose to 13.9p (13.1p) and a proposed rise in the final dividend to
5.2p makes a 7.3p (7p) total.

FT  06 JUL 93 / National Power in Dollars 160m US purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest power generator, is to take its biggest
step overseas to date with a Dollars 160m (Pounds 106m) acquisition in the
US.
The company has agreed to buy Transco Energy Ventures Company (Tevco) which
has interests in seven power plants in operation or under construction,
mainly in the south-eastern US.
Tevco is a subsidiary of Transco Energy Company, a Texas-based gas pipeline
company.
Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive, said yesterday: 'Tevco will
provide us with an experienced US-based project development capability, and
access to the buoyant US market for independent power generation with its
opportunities for profitable investment.'
Tevco develops, builds and owns shares in power plants. It has equity
interests in the equivalent of 558MW of generating capacity, out of a total
1,750MW at the seven plants. It is also involved in plans for a further
2,000MW of capacity.
Other energy-related businesses include a gas pipeline, natural gas vehicle
fuelling services and energy consulting services.
Last year, Tevco made net profits of Dollars 2.6m on revenues of Dollars
35.3m and its capital spending totalled Dollars 8.1m.
Mr Baker said: 'This is an important strategic move, recognising National
Power's reducing market share and limited opportunities for growth in the
UK.' He said the company's long-term goal was to invest Pounds 1bn overseas
by the end of the decade.
National Power also an-nounced yesterday that it was looking at the
development of a Pounds 1.3bn coal-fired power station in India. It will
undertake a feasibility study with Ashok Leyland on a 1,000MW station in
Andra Pradesh, its second coal-fired station project in that country.
The deregulation of the UK electricity market has weakened the domination of
the market by National Power and its main rival PowerGen. Both companies now
view overseas expansion as the main avenue for future growth.
PowerGen recently announced that it was leading a consortium to buy an east
German coal mine and related power generating plant.

FT  06 JUL 93 / S&amp;N hit by Pounds 14m charge for shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 13.9m cost of a shake-up in its beer division reduced annual
profits at Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the UK brewing and leisure group.
The division's reorganisation, already announced, will entail the loss of
600 jobs, 10 per cent of its workforce.
Group pre-tax profits fell 13 per cent to Pounds 192.5m. The company made
Pounds 6.2m less on property disposals. Although trading conditions
continued to be difficult, turnover rose marginally from Pounds 1.49bn to
Pounds 1.51bn in the year to May 2. Excluding exceptional items, profits
were down 4 per cent.
Sir Alick Rankin, chairman, said: 'It is too early in our current year to
point to any real change in demand levels or willingness by customers to
spend more freely, but we are convinced that some momentum is building up.'
Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive, said that while the UK beer market had
declined by 2 per cent, S&amp;N's focus on strong brands had enabled the group
to hold sales and increase market share.
Bad debts of Pounds 13.9m, compared with Pounds 12.6m, contributed to a fall
in the beer division's operating profits from Pounds 99m to Pounds 92m. Mr
Stewart said beer sales to trade outlets were down 3 per cent, but take-home
sales rose by 8 per cent, with brands such as McEwan's Export and Beck's
performing strongly.
Good results by Center Parcs helped the leisure division increase operating
profits by 4.6 per cent to Pounds 78m, although the decline of the UK
holiday centre market last summer meant that Pontins 'experienced very
difficult trading conditions'.
Center Parcs, after a difficult period last July and August, finished the
year with occupancy rates of more than 90 per cent. Most of the Pounds 100m
invested in the leisure division was spent on the new Center Parcs
development at Chaumont in the Loire Valley, which will open this month.
The retail division saw operating profits fall 5.1 per cent to Pounds 54.1m.
A property revaluation had reduced retail's book values by Pounds 45m, but
this was more than offset by a surplus on the group's leisure properties of
Pounds 81m.
Cash outflow before financing was Pounds 35m, mainly because of the Chaumont
spending. Gearing increased from 23 to 29 per cent, largely due to exchange
rates.
Diluted earnings per share, including exceptionals, fell from 33.9p to
30.8p. A final dividend of 11.07p (from 10.59p) gives a total for the year
of 16.83p (from 16.1p), an increase of 4.5 per cent.

FT  06 JUL 93 / BAe discovers it can play hard to get: The on-off talks
between UK defence contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S news of the breakdown of joint venture talks between GEC and
British Aerospace was accompanied by a sharp reminder of what prompted them
in the first place. As yesterday's White Paper on defence spending shows,
times are getting steadily tougher in the defence industry.
As the UK's two dominant defence contractors, GEC and BAe both compete and
co-operate. They were rivals for a Pounds 500m-plus mid-range surface to air
missile contract cancelled yesterday. At the same time, they are jointly
bidding for several defence contracts in international markets.
It is unlikely that Sunday's breakdown of talks - precipitated by disclosure
in the weekend press - is the end of the matter. The two companies have held
occasional discussions ever since BAe was privatised in 1985. The basic
logic is clear. BAe makes warplanes and missiles, while GEC supplies them
with sophisticated electronics. The relationship, as BAe conceded yesterday,
is symbiotic.
In one sense, BAe might be thought the senior partner. Its defence business
is at least as large as GEC's. It is also a prime contractor with a massive
order book, especially to Saudi Arabia. In all important respects, GEC is
merely BAe's supplier.
But in reality, the two companies are far from being equals. After prolonged
upheaval, BAe was brought last year to a point of near-collapse, which at
one point saw its stock market value slump to a mere Pounds 426m. Since
then, its share price has more than tripled, chiefly because of energetic
restructuring by the new chairman, Mr John Cahill. Nevertheless, its value
is still only one sixth that of GEC.
Given the well-known predatory instincts of GEC's boss Lord Weinstock, it is
thus a measure of BAe's increased self-confidence that it was prepared to
talk to GEC at all. Indeed, it seems likely that the underlying reason for
the breakdown of talks was not the unwelcome publicity, but a feeling by BAe
that it was time to back off and start afresh from a position of greater
strength.
In recent months, runs the argument, BAE has not merely seen a huge
appreciation in its share price. It has also made great strides in its
corporate strategy, which will ultimately involve shedding peripheral
businesses such as motors and property and focusing on its traditional
business of defence. The further BAe progresses along this path, the harder
it will be to sell to shareholders the idea of hiving the chief business off
into a joint venture. Also, by implication, the longer BAe waits, the better
the terms it can extract from GEC.
Whether Lord Weinstock sees it in that way is another matter. When BAe was
at its most vulnerable last year he went out of his way to tell journalists
how much he wanted to do a deal. As a master of the long game, he is not
known for overpaying.
On the other hand, putting together a dominant force in UK defence has been
his central ambition for many years. Thwarted in his first bid for Plessey,
he was obliged eventually to share the spoils with Siemens of Germany. When
he bought Ferranti's radar business, he was for once induced to pay over the
odds. He is now in the galling position of knowing that the Ministry of
Defence, which opposed his ambitions for much of the 1980s, is finally on
his side. If BAe returns to the table, he will find it hard to walk away.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Nine Queens Moat directors resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Coppel yesterday took formal control of Queens Moat Houses and
announced the resignation of most of the board.
Only three of the 16 directors on the board when the hotel group's shares
were suspended last March are to remain.
The nine resignations follow the departure last May of Mr Martin Marcus,
deputy chairman, and Mr David Hersey, finance director. The two were
suspended in April after Queens Moat's bankers said they wanted to see
senior directors accepting responsibility for the financial crisis at the
group, which has debts estimated at Pounds 1bn.
The group said yesterday that Mr John Bairstow, chairman, is relinquishing
his executive position but will remain non-executive chairman until a
replacement is found.
Mr Coppel said he hoped to have a new part-time chairman by the end of
October, when the group presents its strategic plan to creditor banks.
Mr Coppel's decision to become group chief executive on a three-year
fixed-term contract was greeted with relief by analysts. Mr Coppel, a former
finance director of Ratners, the jewellery group, was appointed a consultant
to Queens Moat last April.
Mr Mark Finnie of NatWest Securities said Mr Coppel's assumption of the
chief executive's title was 'quite encouraging from the point of view of the
ultimate viability of the group'.
Mr Coppel said audited accounts for 1992 would be available in September,
after which the group would be in a position to begin thinking about a
relisting.
Mr Coppel said visits to the continental businesses and some UK hotels had
revealed that proper financial and management controls had existed in
Germany, Holland and France before the suspension of the shares.
They had been totally inadequate in the UK, particularly in the 40 hotels
run under the group's management incentive scheme.
A finance director for the UK business is expected to be appointed this
week.
Mr Robert Abson, Mr Peter Bertholdt and Mr Leo van der Meer, the directors
responsible for the UK, Germany and Holland respectively, are resigning from
the board to concentrate on their local operations.
Two other executive directors and four of the six non-executives are
leaving. Mr Gerald Bell, hotels division director, is to remain on the
board. Mr John Williams, the property group's managing director, is
considering his position.
The two non-executives remaining are Mr David Howell MP and Mr John Gale. Mr
Coppel said he had asked them to remain to provide continuity.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Spain sets Pounds 3.5bn borrowing in place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Spain is setting up an Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.5bn) borrowing
facility, which bankers claim is the largest financing to be put together by
any European government this year.
NatWest Capital Markets , which is arranging the multi-currency revolving
credit facility, said it reflected 'changes to the ways in which European
Community governments fund themselves following the signing of the
Maastricht Treaty.
'Under the terms of the Treaty, the Bank of Spain will, from 1 January 1994,
be forbidden to provide credit lines to the Treasury of the Kingdom of
Spain. The three-year facility is designed to replace those credit lines.'
NatWest Capital Markets has been in discussions with other European
sovereign borrowers, including Italy, about structuring similar deals.
Last September, the UK Treasury announced a Ecu10bn multi-currency funding
programme, aimed at supporting sterling in the foreign exchange market and
funding government spending.
The financing was seen as 'emergency funding' at a time when sterling was
under considerable pressure in the foreign exchange market.
By contrast, the Kingdom of Spain's deal is not intended for currency
support, but as a means of establishing long-term liquidity.
'Banks are screaming out for quality assets and we feel they will support
this' said one banker involved in the deal.
The Kingdom of Spain has a double A credit rating. The deal will probably be
signed in September and is unlikely to be drawn before the year-end.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Siemens holed by Nixdorf
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STIFF PRICE competition and the appreciation of the D-Mark have dashed hopes
of improved results this year from Siemens Nixdorf (SNI), the Siemens
group's lossmaking computer subsidiary.
In spite of successful cost-cutting and a 50 per cent increase in unit sales
of hardware, losses in the 12 months to the end of September are expected to
match last year's DM513m (Pounds 200m) deficit, Mr Heinrich von Pierer,
group chairman, said yesterday.
He estimated the combined effects of currency movements and price-cutting
would cost SNI DM1bn.
Although overall group prospects had been revised downwards, the company
still expected net profits to match last year's DM1.95bn, said Mr von
Pierer. Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, finance director, hinted that the dividend
would be held at DM13.
Operating results would fall in the full year, and the value of incoming
orders would probably drop by around 1 per cent to DM84bn.
Group sales, meanwhile would rise by around 4 per cent to DM81bn. Initial
forecasts, issued in January, were probably too optimistic, Mr von Pierer
admitted. At the start of the year he expected new orders growth of up to 2
per cent and a 7 per cent increase in turnover.
Reviewing the first eight months of the financial year, Mr von Pierer said
group orders had fallen almost 6 per cent, while turnover had risen 2 per
cent. Incoming domestic orders fell 14 per cent, while foreign demand rose 1
per cent.
Meanwhile, the workforce had been cut by 3 per cent, or 11,000. More than
2,000 more jobs would go by the end of the financial year, leaving a total
workforce of less than 400,000. Rationalisation projects should reduce costs
by as much as 30 per cent in the next few years.
Mr von Pierer claimed restructuring in semiconductors, another drain on
profits, was showing results, bolstered by increased demand for components.
The group's drive into south-east Asia was also yielding fruit.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Hopes rise for further cuts in German interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONDITIONS for further interest rate cuts in Germany improved yesterday amid
fresh signs and renewed claims that the German recession was approaching its
low point.
Hopes of an upturn rose when the economics ministry reported an increase of
almost 4 per cent in new industrial orders in May compared with the previous
month.
The figures supported the Bundesbank's belief - aired last week when it
reduced interest rates, and repeated by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president yesterday - that the worst may be over.
While last week's reductions in the discount and Lombard rates to 6.75 per
cent and 8.25 per cent respectively were largely motivated by a government
agreement on public spending cuts and encouraging inflation indicators, they
were designed to help support economic recovery.
The fragility of the situation was underlined yesterday by aggregate figures
for April and May showing demand for German products still 10 per cent down
on the comparable two months in 1992.
However, Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined the optimists, echoing Mr
Schlesinger's remarks and citing reduced interest rates, the closer linkage
of pay to productivity and improving export demand as grounds for believing
that recovery should come by the turn of the year.
He told a delegation of industry leaders, headed by Mr Tyll Necker,
president of the German industry federation, one of his critics, that
conditions had been improved by Bonn's spending cuts package, corporate tax
reforms and a draft law aimed at increasing working hours flexibility.
Taken with the likelihood of lower inflation, the possible end to economic
decline will raise hopes that the bank will continue its cautious monetary
easing. According to Mr Schlesinger, west German inflation had come a 'step
closer' to the bank's goal of 2 per cent with a 2.7 per cent seasonally
adjusted annual rate in the past three months.
A real 9 per cent fall in turnover in service industries, reported by the
ZDH federal association representing diverse sectors including dry cleaning
and motor repairs, prompted hopes of lower prices as suppliers competed for
business.
But the Bundesbank president also appealed to Bonn to honour its pledges to
reduce state spending next year - and to carry on cutting in future. 'It is
important for everyone that the planned reductions will be translated into
reality,' Mr Schlesinger told an audience of bankers in Bavaria.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Summit to tackle joblessness urged by Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday proposed a global ministerial unemployment
summit in the US in the next few months.
The advance text of Mr Clinton's speech offered the use of his presidential
retreat at Camp David as a possible venue. But the president did not mention
this as he spoke and a senior official said later only that it should be
held in the US.
Mr Clinton said he had directed his senior economics and labour advisers to
invite their counterparts among the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations to a meeting 'in the coming months to search for the causes and
possible remedies for this structural unemployment'.
In a speech to an educational conference before leaving for the G7 summit in
Tokyo, the president described 'stubbornly' high rates of unemployment as
one of the 'most troubling' problems which is confronting the global
economy.
US unemployment, he said, remained at 7 per cent, the private sector in
Europe had generated 'no new net jobs' in the past 20 years, while even
Japan, hitherto immune, was 'finally having problems'. 'This meeting can be
a first step to getting all our job generators running at full speed again,'
he said.
Mr Clinton's initiative reflects his own well-known interest in practical
policies to solve practical problems. In an interview with foreign
correspondents last Friday, he had speculated on the causes of rising
unemployment in France and Japan, two radically different labour markets.
The second main string to his pre-summit bow here was to advance the cause
of greater US-Asian co-operation. He promised that speeches in Tokyo and
Seoul later this week would 'lay out a vision of our engagement in that
region for the coming decades'.
This would include not only a 'stronger and more balanced' economic
relationship with Japan, but the enlistment of the support of both Japan and
Korea behind the successful conclusion of a more open trade agreement by the
end of the year.
Speaking in one of the most Asian cities in the US, Mr Clinton maintained
that trade friction with Japan could not disguise the reality that 'our
relations across the Pacific are, for the most part, of great mutual
benefit'. More than 40 per cent of US trade was with Asia, with US exports
worth over Dollars 120bn (Pounds 80bn) and accounting for 2.3m jobs at home.
He re-emphasised a favourite theme - that 'we have entered an era in which
the line between our domestic and foreign policy has evaporated'.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Exchange will review disclosure guidelines: Concern over
effects of new insider dealing rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK EXCHANGE is to review its guidelines spelling out how company
directors can give price sensitive information to investors without breaking
insider dealing rules.
The review, to be drafted in conjunction with leading corporations and
institutional investors, has been prompted by a crackdown on insider dealing
under the new Criminal Justice Bill, and investor concern about selective
leaking of information.
A draft report is scheduled for early September.
The review was initiated partly by the 100 Group of Finance Directors,
representing Britain's largest companies, the Association of British
Insurers, a shareholder body, and the Institutional Fund Managers
Association, a trade association.
The groups had expressed concern over ambiguities in the Criminal Justice
Bill which could discourage companies from giving information to their
institutional shareholders.
The review will offer guidelines on what constitutes material information.
It will also consider whether there should be regular reporting of
companies' trading conditions in addition to the biannual earnings
statements.
Shareholders are anxious to see rules requiring companies to disclose price
sensitive information - such as profits warnings - to the entire market at
one time. At present, some companies inform their brokers or key
institutional shareholders days before such warnings are issued publicly.
'The longer information remains inside, the greater the opportunity for
insider dealing,' said one of the institutional shareholder representatives.
The exchange says it has no immediate plans to change its so-called 'yellow
book' of rules governing the release of company information. However,
institutional shareholders are understood to be pressing for tougher yellow
book requirements on disclosure by directors.
Some shareholders argue the main problem is enforcing present rules
involving inside information. The yellow book already requires immediate
release of information which could 'reasonably be expected to have a
material effect on market activity in, and prices of, listed securities'.
Dividends, interim figures and 'exceptional matters' fall into this
category.

FT  06 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Japanese warrants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A flurry of equity warrant bonds from Japanese companies this week will
doubtless stir nostalgia among investment bankers. The real wonder, though,
is that this particular item of late 1980s excess has not caused more of a
hangover in the capital markets. Around Dollars 75bn of warrant and
convertible bonds issued by Japanese companies in 1988-89 fall due for
redemption this year. Since most of the warrants and conversion rights will
expire worthless, cash to repay bondholders will have to be found elsewhere.
Yet so far the task of refinancing has caused barely a ripple.
Whether the rest of the year will be as smooth remains an open question. The
ability of Japanese companies to repay bonds out of cash flow - by running
down stocks going into recession, for example - must be limited. All the
more so if they anticipate a recovery in their home market. The brunt of the
burden may fall on the capital markets. But international fund managers
happy to buy equity-linked paper when the Japanese stock market was in a
trough - as they did in the early months of this year - may be less
enthusiastic now share prices have rallied.
The companies can always issue straight bonds or borrow from banks instead,
but only at the cost of higher interest payments. Many are already
struggling to make a decent return on marginal investments funded with what
must have looked like virtually free equity. The real cost of the equity
warrant binge will be seen, not in the Eurobond market, but in the results
of the companies themselves.

If the Treasury's panel of forecasters is really wise, the department was
certainly clever to think of bringing it together. Between Patrick Minford,
who thinks the PSBR is entirely cyclical, and Wynne Godley, who thinks it
largely structural, there is plenty of room to divide and rule. If there is
a semblance of consensus in yesterday's report, it is that inflationary
pressures remain subdued enough to allow further interest rate cuts. That
would certainly come in useful when, as four of the panel point out, further
fiscal tightening is also necessary.
Such sentiments may only increase the pressure for lower rates before
November's budget. Yesterday's money supply figures show some pick-up in the
MO measure for June but the expansion of consumer credit slackened in May
and recent data is consistent with a slowdown in second-quarter growth.
Sterling is strong. The government has to face the Christchurch by-election
and the Tory party conference before it even begins to think seriously about
the Budget. Mr Clarke will just have to hope that there is some scope left
by then for lower interest rates to ease the fiscal pain.

FT  06 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Scottish &amp; Newcastle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, Scottish &amp; Newcastle seems to be managing the beer price war
quite well. Due to its regional concentration in Scotland and the north of
England, it is not really a target of Bass's attempts to gain market share.
Due to its brand portfolio, it has managed an impressive 8 per cent volume
increase in the off-trade. If the beer market grows more difficult, S&amp;N has
its leisure side to fall back on. Pontin's appears to be recovering from a
very bad summer last year; Center Parcs continues, against all the odds, to
defy recession.
The question, though, is whether the company's bets are too well hedged. S&amp;N
is determined to remain in brewing - its Pounds 14m restructuring charge
relates to cost savings in distribution rather than removal of capacity. But
S&amp;N ranks fifth in terms of UK brewers, which is not an easy starting point
for a significant increase in national market share. Similarly, S&amp;N's
relatively weak presence in the south of England may restrain the
development both of its brands and pub retailing, the latter being a weak
spot in the annual results. Whitbread, which has focused with much greater
clarity on brand development and retailing, has seen its share price
outperform since beer discounting intensified in the spring.
S&amp;N must be running some risks by opening another Center Parc in France at
this stage in the economic cycle. But assuming there are no serious
setbacks, its leisure business could soon become the largest single
contributor to operating profits as well as the largest division in terms of
operating assets. Its strategy will then look even more like one of trying
to be all things to all people. Such an approach may appear safe: it also
makes for a dull share price.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAe's rapid exit from discussions with GEC shows its sensitivity to
institutional unease. The new management's top priority is said to be
persuading investors that it is capable of running the business without
producing nasty surprises. So while behind-the-scenes fireside chats with
Lord Weinstock were apparently just about acceptable, a public carve-up of
the UK defence industry is not. Still, as any talks about a deal as large as
this were more or less bound to leak at some point, one wonders why BAe got
involved in the first place. If the company's focus is genuinely on proving
it has a safe pair of hands, it has little need of precipitate talks with
GEC - especially as its business and share price are recovering nicely. It
is to be hoped that Mr John Cahill is not in too much of a hurry to write
himself into the history books as BAe's great helmsman.
In the longer term, there are areas where it would make sense for the two
companies to collaborate. BAe makes missiles while GEC Marconi makes the
electronics to go into them. If the currently proposed joint venture between
BAe Dynamics and Matra goes ahead, GEC would be a logical third partner. Yet
a full scale merger of the two companies is more questionable. Such a
vertically integrated company would have trouble selling components to other
manufacturers, as Marconi currently does. BAe is also able to buy from a
wide range of component makers. GEC has always been more enthusiastic about
a full scale tie-up, perhaps because it covets BAe's lead contractor status.
Or maybe Lord Weinstock merely wants back those parts of the UK aircraft
business he lost when the aerospace industry was nationalised in 1977.

Too old at 65? One of the unfortunate casualties of the break-up of ICI is
the group's house magazine, The Roundel, whose circulation is just under
100,000. ICI was barely two years old when Sir Alfred Mond, ICI's first
chairman, sent word that he wanted his employees to have a magazine that
would make them all feel they were a 'band of brothers'.
It started with the good wishes of King George VI, then the Duke of York,
lasted nearly 70 years and, unusually for a house mag, had a mind of its own
which is evident in its farewell issue. It was much admired by other
in-house publications. In its hey-day it carried 132 pages, and spawned
another 80 ICI periodicals.
Perhaps its downfall began when it was relaunched and readers were no longer
required to pay towards the 70p cost of each copy. Whatever the reason, the
magazine is no longer 'appropriate for the needs of the new look ICI'.
Something else is planned which will communicate more directly with the
workforce, says ICI.
Easy to chop - hard to build. Maybe a sign of the times?

The winds of change blowing through China have reached the byways of East
Sussex. Larry Yung, the seriously rich son of Rong Yiren, China's
vice-president, has bought his first English country estate. He has snapped
up Harold Macmillan's old family home of Birch Grove.
It is not known what Yung plans to do with the 14-bedroom mansion which has
entertained statesmen ranging from Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy to
Charles de Gaulle and Nikita Kruschev. But he should not feel too out of
place if he chooses to move in. After all, the eldest son of China's
multi-millionaire vice-president was born in the back of a Rolls Royce on
the way to hospital in Shanghai.
Sadly for Yung, the 1949 Chinese revolution - or 'liberation' as the
Communists' like to call it - interrupted his family's high life. But, since
arriving in Hong Kong in 1978, he has made up for it. He has built up the
local branch of China International Trust and Investment Company into one of
the colony's leading conglomerates, and is now acquiring all the necessary
trappings of a taipan.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Observer: Clark versus Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate over the rundown of Britain's coal industry seems to be getting
rather personal. Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, has fallen out with
one-time ally Michael Clark, Tory MP for Rochford who used to chair the
now-disbanded energy committee.
The tiff dates back to a previous parliamentary coal debate at the end of
March when the MP made some controversial comments about the motivations of
some British Coal managers in the run-up to privatisation. The suggestion
was that some of them were out to make the corporation as profitable as
possible in the hope of benefiting personally in the event of it being
privatised through a management buy-out.
Hardly, a life and death matter. But letters were exchanged with chairman
Clarke threatening to sue if the suggestions were repeated outside
parliament. With MP Clark apparently unrepentant, the situation has since
escalated with the chairman vetoing the MP's presence on a proposed day out
to the Selby coalfield next September by the all party energy studies group.
'The chairman was concerned that Dr Clark might not be given the best of
receptions in the coalfield,' British Coal said yesterday.
Not good enough, say the MP's fellow energy students, who are now refusing
to visit Selby without him.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Personal View: Remove roadblock to Russian reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STANLEY FISCHER and JEFFREY SACHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six months ago, the Russian economy stood at the brink of hyperinflation.
Today the stabilisation of the rouble and the end of high inflation are
within reach. The near-hyperinflation at the end of last year was caused by
virtually unrestrained central bank credit creation, amounting to an
astonishing 40 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992. Since then, Mr
Boris Fedorov, the new finance minister, has gradually been gaining control
of macroeconomic policy.
In April, Mr Fedorov and the central bank governor, Mr Viktor Geraschenko,
signed an agreement committing the central bank to reduce the rate of credit
creation to less than 10 per cent a month by December. Inflation is now
running at about 15 per cent a month, down sharply from the
near-hyperinflationary 30 per cent at the end of 1992.
This credit agreement reflects the growing political strength of the
government relative to the congress, to which the central bank is
responsible. The government has been strengthened by President Yeltsin's
victory in the April referendum and indications that the constitutional
convention is going his way.
The Group of Seven industrial countries' announcement in April of a Dollars
28bn aid package has also strengthened the reformers.
In May, the Russian government and the International Monetary Fund agreed on
budget and credit targets, which will mean Dollars 3bn in IMF loans should
start flowing to Russia in July.
The budget deficit planned for the second half of 1993 is about 10 per cent
of GNP. Of this, about 3 per cent will be financed by central bank credit
and 7 per cent from abroad, including the IMF, World Bank and western
governments. By borrowing abroad to finance the budget deficit, the
government reduces the amount of money it has to print, so reducing
inflationary pressures.
Implementation of these fiscal and credit policies will make low inflation
possible, but they are not sufficient to stabilise the currency. To do that
and reduce inflation rapidly, Russia should peg the exchange rate. The
market value of the rouble would be supported by tight monetary and fiscal
policies, and defended by the central bank.
Russian stabilisation will not succeed without delivery of already-committed
western financial assistance. Part of the assistance is needed to finance
the budget deficit. Part is needed to help defend the exchange rate: the
Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund that the IMF controls should be made
available on a rapid timetable, provided the Russians tighten credit and the
budget. Similarly, an IMF standby loan of Dollars 4bn and a new World Bank
loan of Dollars 1bn should be brought on line quickly.
These western commitments should be reaffirmed to President Yeltsin at this
week's Tokyo summit, though the actual flow of assistance would be
conditional on Russia's implementation of the remaining steps for
stabilisation.
The Russians could credibly commit to a stable, pegged exchange rate by
September or October. They need several weeks to ensure that the credit
agreement with the central bank is working; to adjust energy and other
controlled prices before the start of the stabilisation programme; and to be
reasonably sure that the budget deficit can be held to 5 per cent of GNP.
The Russians should go for it. But will they? Ironically, one thing that
might hold them back is the view that things are going rather well now. So
why rock the boat? The answer is that restructuring of the economy cannot be
undertaken with annual inflation of more than 400 per cent. At some point,
Russia will have to stabilise, and the circumstances are unlikely to be more
favourable than now.
Unfortunately, the G-7 is threatening to put a roadblock in the way at this
critical juncture. Recent reports suggest the Europeans and Japanese want to
scale back sharply the Dollars 4bn 'privatisation fund' for enterprise
restructuring, proposed by the US to complement the Western aid package
announced previously. Failure to make significant funding available for this
purpose would set back the restructuring of industry and lower the chances
for successful stabilisation.
No single policy by the West will make or break Russia's stabilisation. But,
with the opportunity for Russia's success so high, we can only hope that
both Russia and the G-7 recognise the historic opportunity when they meet in
Tokyo.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Hanging on by a thread: Tariff barriers and low foreign
labour costs are driving Japanese textile production offshore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Toray, Japan's biggest textiles company, opens a Pounds 50m factory in
the UK tomorrow there will be the usual ribbon-cutting and rice wine. But
behind the razzmatazz lies a deep pessimism in the industry.
Like many leading western industrialised countries, Japan has seen the
production of textiles and clothing drift to countries with lower wages
elsewhere in Asia. Unlike its western counterparts, however, the Japanese
government seems unwilling to protect domestic companies with trade barriers
against imports.
An executive at Teijin, Japan's second-largest synthetic fibre textiles
company, blames the lack of domestic protection on the US and the EC, both
of which are pressing Japan to cut its trade surplus, set to reach Dollars
150bn this year. 'The government has problems with the trade surplus. We
believe that the (domestic) textile and clothing industries will be
sacrificed,' he said.
But Japan's textiles companies are not prepared to be martyrs in the trade
war. Unable to beat the importers on home territory, they are engaged in an
unprecedented diversion of investment abroad. Overseas, they can take
advantage of a combination of lower labour costs, lower transport costs to
local customers and access to local markets that have import tariffs.
Toray is typical of the new strategy. Sales from its domestic plants are
worth about Dollars 3bn a year, three times as much as those from overseas
plants. Over the next seven years, however, it plans to treble foreign
production while maintaining domestic output at its current level.
The UK plant is one of the several overseas ventures it has established to
promote this process. Toray says it chose Britain because of the presence of
one of its best customers: Marks and Spencer, the UK's largest clothes
retailer. The plant will supply silk-like polyester fabrics to garment
makers that supply M and S.
The fabric produced by the plant is unique in the UK. The yarn is twisted in
different ways during weaving to create a variety of textures. Demand for
such fabrics in the UK is currently satisfied by imports: Japan exported
polyester fabric worth Pounds 42m to the UK last year.
Britain is not alone in Europe in winning inward investment from Japanese
textiles companies. France's largest textile company, DMC, has signed a
joint venture with Japan's fourth-biggest textiles company, Unitika, for the
production and marketing of polyester fabrics near Grenoble. Production
started this spring, and sales are projected to reach about Dollars 70m a
year by the mid-1990s. At the same time, Unitika plans to cut output at its
main Japanese cotton-spinning plant by half by next March as part of its
winding down of domestic production.
Despite recent commitments in the EC, the overwhelming bulk of Japanese
investment is going to neighbouring Asian countries, principally Indonesia,
Thailand, Vietnam and China. In common with European countries, they have
developed garment industries that use imported Japanese textiles - but
labour costs are significantly cheaper. The biggest names in Japan's
textiles industry are involved:
Toray has factories in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia and a joint venture
in China.
Teijin is reducing polyester output in Japan this year at the same time as
investing Y25bn (Dollars 233.64m) in Indonesia and Thailand. Its Indonesian
output is scheduled almost to double between 1991 and 1994. It also has
factories in the Philippines, Thailand and Brazil.
Last summer, Toyobo established its fourth cloth-manufacturing joint venture
in Malaysia. This year, it is cutting Japanese output by 20 per cent by
suspending production at 10 of its factories for between four and eight
days. Kanebo is closing three of its five domestic cotton spinning and
weaving mills this year. It may transfer its entire spinning and weaving
operation overseas and is looking at China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.
Kuraray manufactures in Indonesia, as does Osaka's Mitsubishi Rayon, which
is planning to expand in Thailand and the Philippines.
The switch by Japanese textile makers from domestic production to overseas
investment is seen in output figures from the International Textile
Manufacturers Institute. The institute says textile production in Japan has
fallen by 16 per cent in the past year.
A further shrinking of Japan's domestic textile and clothing industries, as
Teijin fears, would represent an extraordinary turnaround in the fortunes of
what was once a classic export-driven Japanese industrial success story.
In 1957, Toray and Teijin licensed a polyester fibre-manufacturing process
from ICI. Within 20 years, Japan's manufacturing strength had triggered
import controls by western countries in the form of the multi-fibre
arrangement (MFA) which placed quotas on incoming textiles and apparel. In
the early 1980s, ICI withdrew from polyester making.
But during the decade rising Japanese prosperity began to add to labour
costs, and textiles from the rest of Asia started to pour in. During the
late 1980s, Japanese consumers also developed a taste for designer clothes
and fabrics from Europe and the US.
Without tariff barriers to protect it, and sandwiched between cheap Asian
products and western designer labels, the Japanese market succumbed to a
flood of imports.
In the course of the 1980s, textile and clothing exports halved as a
percentage of total exports. As recently as 1986, Japanese textiles and
clothing ran a trade surplus. By 1991, the surplus had become an Dollars 8bn
deficit, the third-biggest in the world, overtaking that of the UK.
In textiles, South Korea, Taiwan and China have each outstripped Japan in
synthetic fibre output, as the value of imports into Japan more than doubled
during the 1980s to Dollars 4.1bn.
In clothing, similar imports grew sixfold to Dollars 8.7bn during the 1980s
and clothes made abroad are now the norm.
In response, Japanese textiles and clothing companies are pressing the
government to erect import barriers, but to little avail. 'We want the
government to limit imports. But they are hesitating,' says Mr Nobuo
Murakami, managing director of Kurabo, a large Osaka yarn and fabric maker.
'Personally, and in the industry as a whole, we are very dissatisfied with
the government.'
Mr Murakami has a lot to complain about. Kurabo specialises in cotton goods,
a business that is hurting from increased imports more than synthetics: the
manufacturing equipment is cheaper, and the skills and technology needed is
simpler, so developing countries can more easily compete with industrialised
rivals.
Japan's cotton-spinning capacity, for example, has fallen by a quarter since
the mid-1980s and will halve over the next few years, says Mr Murakami. More
than half the present 54 companies producing cotton in Japan will merge with
rivals or go bust 'soon', he says.
Even this projection might be optimistic. One textile industry observer at a
Tokyo stockbroker said: 'I don't see why cotton spinning in Japan should
survive at all.'
Mr Murakami draws a parallel with what happened in postwar Britain:
Manchester, the capital of Britain's industrial north-west, was once known
as King Cotton. Today, no large mills remain.
'We are like Manchester was,' he said. 'Under the hammer.'
Two avenues offer some hope for the future: high fashion and high
technology. As in the west, there is a small but prestigious business in
high fashion garment making. Volumes are relatively small, less than 5 per
cent of total garment sales, but margins are high. A few foreign investors
have started to produce in Japan: Paul Smith, the UK menswear designer,
manufacturers in 30 Japanese factories for its 78 Japanese shops.
High technology can also help Japan's synthetics manufacturers. They have
invested heavily in research and development to create fabrics that, so far,
cannot be copied elsewhere. The latest microfibre fabrics, those with
filaments finer than silk, have been credited with sparking a revival in the
high fashion fortunes of polyester. Toray's main Japanese plant, at Mishima
in the shadow of Mount Fuji, is working at full capacity on microfibres.
But Japanese industrialists are aware that competitors will not let them
retain their high-tech edge for long. 'Within 10-20 years, Korea and Taiwan
will catch up,' admits Mr Hiroshi Maeda, managing director of Toray. 'We are
not confident we will always be able to stay ahead of these countries.'

THE UK government's defence white paper, published yesterday, is useful as
far as it goes. Despite criticism from some backbench Tory MPs, nothing in
the document, Defending Our Future, should come as a surprise. Since
cutbacks in defence spending of Pounds 1bn over two years were announced
last year, all that remained was to choose where the axe would fall. The
decision to cut conventional submarines, frigates and Tornado aircraft is
sensible given the reduced military threat following the end of the cold
war.
The criticism of Defending Our Future is not that cuts are too savage, but
that it fails to undertake a root-and-branch examination of Britain's
defence commitments. This is not simply because of budgetary constraints,
though they certainly cannot be ignored. At a time when other parts of the
public sector - in particular, social security, health and education - are
having to justify their programmes from first principles, defence
commitments costing Pounds 24bn a year should not be immune from similar
scrutiny.
A review is also necessary because Britain has yet to make a full adjustment
to the changed economic and geopolitical realities of the past 50 years.
Given that Britain is no longer a rich imperial power, it is not clear a
priori that it should spend 4.1 per cent of its GDP on defence, while France
spends 3.4 per cent, Germany 2.2 per cent, Italy 2.0 per cent and Spain only
1.7 per cent. Nor is it clear that taxpayers could not enjoy a more generous
peace dividend than that so far delivered following the end of the cold war.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, says a defence review is
inappropriate because the international scene is changing so quickly that
the conclusions of a review would be out-of-date before publication. But if
ministers applied this judgment widely, they would not undertake fundamental
reviews in any policy area.
In defence, there are many pressing questions. Should Britain always be
among the first to volunteer its services as a global policeman when its
interests seem no more at stake than those of other nations less eager to
become involved? Could the number of troops in Northern Ireland be cut, as
Mr Archie Hamilton, the former armed forces minister, argued at the weekend?
And does Britain's defence force, including its nuclear deterrent, need to
be independent or would there be advantages in pooling some defence roles
with other European Community members of Nato?
It may be argued that Britain's permanent seat on the UN security council
depends on maintaining a nuclear capability and being willing to become
involved in global operations. But if this is so, the question remains
whether the advantage of sitting at the top table is worth the price.
Such questions are controversial. But that is no reason to avoid them. In
addressing them, the guiding principle should be a hard-nosed assessment of
Britain's realistic ambitions rather than a romantic view of its past.

DISRUPTION TO business caused by the security cordon in the City of London
was described as negligible yesterday. The first working day of
anti-terrorist traffic restrictions in a small area of the capital's
financial district failed to produce the threatened jams. Vital though it is
to defeat terrorism, these measures do not look like part of a
well-considered and coherent strategy for fighting the Irish Republican
Army.
The plan has been instituted at the request of the City Corporation, the
local authority for the district. On two recent occasions, the IRA has
planted large bombs, causing death, injury and hundreds of millions of
pounds of damage. Two other attempts, involving large quantities of
explosives, were thwarted outside the City's boundaries. The Corporation
felt that action was needed to protect the City's position as an
international financial centre. Further successful attacks would harm
London's prospects in competing for financial businesses which might be
tempted to relocate to other European cities
The Corporation's security cordon has, however, given the terrorists a
propaganda coup by so publicly interfering with commercial activities in the
capital. In its mainland bombing campaign, the IRA's avowed aim is to
prevent the British living life normally, so long as Northern Ireland
remains part of the UK. By setting up roadblocks and police checkpoints in
the City, the Corporation has provided compelling evidence of the success of
the campaign.
The strategy is also unlikely to deter bomb attacks in London, only a tiny
part of which is covered by the cordon. A similar security ring in Belfast
has had some success in protecting a small part of the city centre. But the
bombers have simply shifted their attacks to targets elsewhere in Belfast
and to other provincial towns. There is a grave danger that the City of
London's security cordon will displace the terrorist attacks to other parts
of the capital.
Perhaps the most compelling argument against the security cordon is that
once made permanent, it would be difficult to dismantle. Except in the
unlikely event of the IRA publicly abandoning its mainland bombing campaign,
the removal of the cordon would be seen as either an admission of failure or
an invitation to the bombers to return.
The City traffic restrictions have been imposed as part of a six-month pilot
study, since legislation would be required to make them permanent. The
Corporation should think hard before proceeding to this stage. It would be
wise to spend the next six months thinking of less disruptive and
potentially more effective ways of deploying the very substantial resources
involved in manning the new security system. Draconian car-parking
restrictions and more intense surveillance, of the kind used around
Whitehall since the mortar attack on Downing Street, are options worth
considering.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S ECONOMIC progress in the two years since the government of Mr
Narasimha Rao came into office has been impressive. For this, the prime
minister, his minister of finance, Dr Manmohan Singh, and the officials who
are pushing reform forward deserve both credit and support. Both of these
were duly received at the meeting of aid donors in Paris at the end of last
week, which pledged assistance worth US Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.9bn) for
1993-94.
India contains nearly as many people as Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America
together. The attempt to reconcile economic progress with democracy in so
huge and poor a country has something heroic about it. Until recently,
however, that heroism was not matched by common sense over economic policy.
The trigger for change was a crisis. Two years ago India was on the brink of
default. Decisive action at home, luck with the weather and strong support
from abroad have brought a remarkable turnround. Foreign exchange reserves
have increased from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 6 1/2 bn; annual consumer price
inflation has fallen from a peak of 17 per cent to 6 per cent; the central
government's fiscal deficit has been reduced from 8.4 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1990-91 to the 4.7 per cent expected this year; overall
economic growth, after dipping to 1.2 per cent in 1991-92, is expected to
exceed 5 per cent again this year. Little wonder India is one of the IMF's
models.
Policymakers did not limit themselves to stabilisation. A 'big bang' reform
was ruled out for political reasons. But a discussion paper released by the
finance ministry at the end of last week stresses that what has happened so
far represents the first two years of a five-year programme of
market-oriented reform.
Still to come, says the finance ministry, are further fiscal consolidation,
completion of tax reform (including introduction of a VAT), further
reductions in tariffs (which still peak at 85 per cent), further financial
sector reform, improvements to infrastructure (notably power generation),
reform of the oil sector and, not least, 'restructuring of weak and unviable
enterprises'.
This is good as far as it goes, but it does not yet go far enough. The
government is not yet prepared to admit that both efficiency and the need
for additional investment make wholesale privatisation inescapable. It has
been unwilling to recognise that private employers will not hire people they
are unable to fire. It has hardly begun to reform perhaps the most
intractable of all problems, centre-state relations.
India has far to go. But beginning a new departure is often the hardest
part. Provided neither complacency nor instability set in, the chances for
further reform and improved performance look excellent. The finance ministry
talks of sustainable growth of 6 to 7 per cent. Six per cent is a minimum
for a country like India. But 7 per cent need not be the ceiling.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: Too much protesting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN POWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent editorials and letters about British Gas's supply monopoly and
future structure confirm an industry view that British Gas doth protest too
much. The assertion by its chief executive, Mr C H Brown, that a competitive
framework would lead households to face gas bill increases of 'up to 94 per
cent' (Letters, June 30), is unworthy. No government would allow that threat
to materialise and British Gas does itself no favours by pretending
otherwise.
The heart of the matter is that energy consumers deserve choice and need
regulatory protection. A new gas market, probably franchise based, must
eventually empower suppliers, including British Gas, to compete on price
(below a regulated maximum) while meeting all obligatory standards of
service British Gas so effectively provides today. Those standards include
an obligation to supply gas at a tariff price to households which are
connected to the mains; the British Gas notion that low-income households
might one day pay more than the better-off is politically preposterous.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: Japan the key to world economic stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL CASTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A change of agenda for the Tokyo G7 meeting is essential if we are to
move the world out of unemployment stalemate and public purse insolvency.
Once again the political reality of trade liberalisation against the
background of world recession will ensure that the requisite domestic
restructuring and consequent economic dislocation are neither affordable for
the public purse nor politically acceptable at the ballot box.
A change in agenda which enhances the international status of the Japanese,
the only nation currently able to pump-prime world economic activity, is
more likely to succeed than US pressure for managed trade and European
pressure for immediate reductions in the Japanese trade surplus. Japanese
industrial hegemony and the resultant Dollars 150bn forecast trade surplus
may be a destabilising factor in world trade.
The Japanese, however, are rightfully proud of their success post Hiroshima.
They should not be publicly castigated, but rather shown a new agenda by the
G7 leaders which requires Japan to shoulder its share of the cost of global
security. Such an initiative would have the Japanese being applauded by the
international community for their global statesmanship rather than hounded
by our elected representatives because of Japanese industrial superiority.
The end of the cold war and the defeat of the heavy hand of communism have
brought a greater threat to world security than at any time since President
Kennedy faced off the Soviets in the 1960s Cuban missile crisis. The cold
war is over but Ukraine is sabre rattling, the nuclear missiles are still in
place, the Black Sea fleet has yet to get clear direction and there are more
than 20 nuclear reactors in Russia alone, which should be shut down
immediately if more Chernobyls are to be averted. Surely this threat to
global security is an agenda item which, in our own self-interests, should
be the major focus of the G7; an item which national electorates can more
readily understand than the dismantling of protective bilateral tariffs on
spirits, rice, corn and textiles.
The G7 nations have the capacity and the technology to assist the
Commonwealth of Independent States in its basic needs and to underwrite
global nuclear security, but not through World Bank strait-jackets and trade
wars with the Japanese. By allocating geographical areas within the CIS to
each G7 member we can move with the speed required to meet the immediacy of
CIS needs. Such a programme needs a financial catalyst and the Japanese are
in the position to shoulder the costs of materials and technology transfer.
To succeed we need to create the agenda and ameliorate the mutual distrust
of the Russians and the Japanese which is so manifest in such issues as the
ownership of the Kurile Islands north of Japan.
What should our elected leaders be pursuing - managed trade and Japanese
humiliation or managed security and Japanese willing statesmanship in
pump-priming world security and, through it, economic stability? For me, at
least, and more importantly for the future of my children, I will vote for
the latter. This is the necessary and legitimate contribution of our
generation to securing world peace with the added dividend of stimulating
world economic activity.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: Private funding for pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN G GLANFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your analysis of the pitfalls in both common methods of pension
provision ('Second best pensions', June 30) hints at the real problem. State
pensions will become more costly or benefits must reduce. As the unfunded
state system is unsustainable at present levels in the long term, the
private sector will be needed to provide the balance. However, it is
notoriously ineffective in that role without aid; people will not save
sufficiently until too late. Witness the poor take-up of good schemes
demanding low employee contributions.
Government has already legislated for compulsory pensions via Serps (state
earnings-related pension scheme). It should now go further by requiring
minimum private contributions in respect of all employees to become over
time, say, 10 per cent of pay, while gradually cutting back on unfunded
state provision. Transparency would require this element to be defined
contribution, leaving any top-up to companies to negotiate for employees
direct.
This would deliver quality benefits cost effectively without disruption to
our cost base.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: Common recycling target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID EGGLESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Stop the EC waste war' (July 1) was an excellent review
of the problems created by the German approach to 'solving' the challenge of
what to do with used packaging.
Your proposed solution, setting different recycling targets for different
materials in different countries is, however, a political non-runner.
An alternative approach increasingly finding political, business and even
environmentalist favour is to set a challenging but common valorisation
target (which embraces re-use, recycling and energy recovery).
Each member state would then choose its own route to meeting successfully
the broad target, rather than being forced into the environmentally
unsustainable strait-jacket of recycling alone.

FT  06 JUL 93 / 1976 and all that: The chancellor's dilemma - an inside view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his recent FT interview the new chancellor threatened to put up taxes if
the economy did not recover. That was extraordinary because, before he came
to the Treasury, Mr Clarke's instincts were Keynesian and Keynesians believe
that, when demand is weak, it should be boosted by tax cuts, not held back
by tax increases.
It looks as though Mr Clarke, after talking to his officials and junior
ministers, has come round to the Treasury view that the most important task
confronting him is to get the public finances in order. A strong recovery
would help in that respect, because tax revenues would rise and
recession-linked spending would fall. But, if a faltering economy fails to
deliver this improvement automatically, Mr Clarke's first Budget will make
good the shortfall.
This is the economics of the hard centre: tough on borrowing, tough on
inflation. It will be deeply unpopular on the right, which will say it is
anything but tough on public spending. Battered by recession, Mr Major's
government has seen the reduction in public spending achieved under Lady
Thatcher completely reversed. At 45 per cent, it now takes a greater share
of GDP than in 1979.
The best way of reducing borrowing is to cut public spending, but that
option has been ruled out this year. So Mr Clarke now faces the classic
dilemma: borrow or tax? If he opts for higher taxes, the right, already
upset by spending levels it sees as creeping socialism, might rebel. Labour
will gloat over broken promises. So, more borrowing seems the easier option.
Though it might give Mr Clarke an easier time in the House of Commons it
would, however, play badly on the financial markets.
The government's Pounds 50bn budget deficit has been funded relatively
easily so far, but the price has been high. Despite core inflation down to 3
per cent, and headed lower, long interest rates remain around 8 per cent.
The markets are far from convinced that we have permanently kicked the
inflation habit. They are worried by the worst deterioration in the public
finances since 1976. That was the year of recurrent sterling crises,
remembered for chancellor Healey's about-turn at the airport followed by a
cap-in-hand application for an lMF loan.
In 1976, public borrowing as a share of GDP was nearly 11 percentage points
higher than six years earlier. Today, a greater rise has occurred in five
years. On both occasions the increase had its origins in a tax-cutting boom,
followed by a deep recession, with an election in between.
In 1976, the public borrowing problem was compounded by a balance of
payments problem. The present balance of payments deficit, at 3 per cent of
GDP, is three times as bad as in 1976, without the excuse of an oil price
hike.
Many countries had current account deficits as big as the UK's in 1976. Few
do today.
This year, Britain will borrow some Pounds 20bn from abroad to fund its
current account deficit. The government could help in principle by selling
some of its Pounds 50bn of debt to foreigners. But persuading them to buy
may prove difficult - as it did in 1976, and for similar reasons.
No lender likes putting money into a country (or firm, or household) in
which the burden of debt is steadily rising as interest charges are rolled
up into the outstanding debt. Yet the present position of the UK government
is even worse than that. Total debt is officially forecast to rise by much
more than the interest bill over the next four years.
The debt burden will rise from less than a third of national income to over
a half.
That will not be easy to change. The large international buyers of
government bonds will, as in 1976, note the UK government has a small
majority. That is why spending cuts have been ruled out. Backbench pressure
may also preclude tax increases, hated on the right for ideological reasons,
and resisted across the board (as in 1976) by those worried about their
effect on a fragile recovery at risk from a world economic downturn.
It is because of the political risk of persistent budget deficits that
yields remain so high in real terms. Selling gilts at an 8 per cent coupon
with underlying in-flation at 3 cent is expensive, but preferable to the
alternative, seen in 1976, of a buyers' strike. For, once the Bank gets
behind with its funding, another risk looms: the money supply starts to grow
very rapidly, reinforcing inflationary fears.
Such fears would tend to be self-fulfilling, since they would weaken the
pound, thus adding to inflationary pressures. The events of Black Wednesday
have left the authorities with depleted foreign exchange reserves (another
parallel with 1976) so intervention would not be an option. A falling pound
would make it almost impossible to sell gilts to foreigners, so the
monetisation of the debt would accelerate unless interest rates were jacked
up sharply. All the ingredients for a full-scale financial crisis would be
in place.
This vicious circle actually occurred in 1976. But then the markets saw
Britain as a strike-torn country run by a Labour government in the thrall of
unruly trade unions paying a coupon on its debt which barely matched the
endemic double-digit wage-led rate of inflation. The financial markets like
peaceful labour markets, Conservative governments, low inflation and high
real interest rates. They will draw comfort from yields well above a low
inflation rate underpinned by a remarkable fall in wage inflation and the
lowest number of strikes on record.
A repeat of 1976 is not likely. But that distant horror story reminds us
that the new chancellor's first Budget has, above all, to reassure the
financial markets. Another financial crisis, so soon after Black Wednesday,
could bring down the government.
As he ponders his options, the new chancellor may reflect on another, more
comforting precedent: the 1981 Budget, which raised taxes in the depths of a
recession. That ran counter to the conventional Keynesian wisdom of the time
and was deeply unpopular. But it is now generally agreed to have laid the
foundations for the subsequent long period of sustained growth with low
inflation.
It seems to be a fact of life that the deterioration in the public finances
generally happens in the boom years, but becomes apparent only in the
subsequent recession.
Why that is so is a question to which I shall return next week. But because
it is so I believe Mr Clarke should put up taxes in his first Budget and I
believe he will.

special adviser to former chancellor Norman Lamont

FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: 60-hour week not 'macho'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CURWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I venture to take issue with the view expressed in 'Macho managers
under fire' (July 3) that it is 'lunacy' to work long hours. For my part, I
am at work by 8am and normally clock up 50 to 60 hours a week in the office,
including weekends. However, while this can be tiring, it is never, of
itself, stressful, nor is it in any way worthy of the term 'workaholic'.
I agree that fear of losing one's job is a source of stress, but I would
have thought this applied even more to poorly-paid clerks working a 40-hour
week than to highly-paid managers. What the article does not point out is
that the typical manager is too sedentary, and would feel less stressed if
he or she ate fewer lunches and instead went to the gym.
More important, 'Dorking Man' is stressed precisely because of living in
Dorking. It takes me 10 minutes to commute to work. The time it takes for
'Dorking Man' to wend his weary way home would provide an additional hour to
be spent with the family, which is equally true first thing in the morning.
A 50-hour working week leaves sufficient time for other things. The roots of
the problem lie elsewhere.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Success story's next chapter: Ghana is an African role
model, but still relies on foreign aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man responsible for black Africa's test case economy, Dr Kwesi
Botchwey, Ghana's veteran finance minister, appears remarkably relaxed.
With some justification. Ghana's 10-year structural adjustment programme has
attracted Dollars 5bn in foreign aid, and the well has not run dry. Last
week Dr Botchwey was back in Accra, two days after asking a Paris meeting of
donors for additional funds and getting half a billion dollars more than he
had asked for - a further Dollars 2.1bn over the next two years.
Today, Mr Botchwey will attend a conference in London, sponsored by the
Confederation of British Industry. He will try to woo foreign investors by
publicising Ghana's streamlined investment code, which removes many curbs on
multinational investment.
Times have changed. Ghana, the first British colony to achieve independence
in 1957, became synonymous with African state socialism and economic
mismanagement in the 1960s and 1970s. Now it has embraced the market.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, starved of African
success stories, are quick to present Ghana as a role model. Ten years of
liberalisation, deregulation and devaluation, cushioned by annual aid flows
amounting to 8 per of gross domestic product, have enabled the government to
produce an average growth rate in income per head of 2 per cent a year since
Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings, then Ghana's military ruler, agreed to
take the IMF medicine in 1983.
Compared with the rest of Africa, this is impressive. Since the 'economic
recovery programme' began, Ghanaian gross domestic product has grown by an
average 4.9 per cent a year, more than twice the sub-Saharan average. It
follows a decade in which real income per head in Ghana fell by 30 per cent.
Yet, after 10 years of adjustment, Ghana remains desperately poor. Its
average income per head was only Dollars 400 last year. The World Bank
estimates that, at current annual growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per
cent for population), it would take more than 20 years for the average poor
Ghanaian to reach the current poverty threshold, defined as two-thirds of
today's average consumption per head.
A recent World Bank strategy document, 'Ghana 2000 and beyond - setting the
stage for accelerated growth and poverty reduction', estimates that Ghana
needs to raise its growth rate to 8 per cent a year to free the average poor
person from poverty in 10 years. The government hopes that a leaner,
export-led manufacturing sector will enable it to reach that rate by 2000.
But Ghana's task is immense, as the World Bank report makes clear. The
domestic economy remains heavily dependent on a narrow commodity base -
primarily cocoa and gold - for export earnings while manufacturing exports
are tiny. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in
1990, compared with 32 per cent in rapidly growing Thailand  - half the
level at which Thailand started on the growth path back in 1965. Asia's
newly industrialised countries, as well as Thailand and Malaysia, had also
achieved universal primary education before they began to industrialise in
the early 1960s. In Ghana, 20 per cent of young people are not registered at
primary school.
The east Asian economies provide a benchmark against which Ghana can measure
the task ahead. East Asia's experience also suggests lessons for the
Ghanaian government's strategy in the second phase of development.
The focus of Ghana's policy over the past decade has been on reducing the
role of government and, in some areas such as the privatisation of state
industry, this focus continues. But the government also appears to be
pursuing a form of intervention which goes beyond the traditional 'enabling'
role for government: providing information and investing in education,
health and infrastructure.
The government now talks of 'a new agenda of activism' that will offer
special incentives to investors. Mr Botchwey has asked the private sector to
draft guidelines for the selective protection of infant domestic industries.
'Picking winners is a hazardous thing,' he concedes. 'The protection
measures will have to be time-bound and the criteria must be clear and
transparent, to avoid charges of political favouritism.'
At the same time, following the removal of credit ceilings, the Bank of
Ghana, the central bank, is using its indirect influence in the foreign
exchange market to support the government's growth strategy. By keeping
foreign exchange in short supply, the central bank has encouraged the
commercial banks to direct their supply of foreign exchange towards
export-orientated customers who might earn and return foreign exchange in
the future. In the words of one banker in Accra: 'The banks now operate the
Bank of Ghana's exchange control regime on its behalf.'
A third focus of the government's new activism is foreign investment. The
government plans to lure foreign companies with tax holidays and other
fiscal incentives, particularly multinationals which have encountered quota
problems in east Asia.
'A number of multinationals who quit in the 1970s are coming back,' says Mr
Botchwey. 'They are looking at the comparative labour costs and are
interested in producing on a large scale for export.' Sunquist, the tuna
fish company, plans to invest Dollars 10m because it is encountering quota
ceilings on exports from Thailand.
So far, progress has been slow. Ghana's private sector success stories in
export diversification are few, while additional substantial foreign
investments have yet to materialise. One reason is that investors have been
waiting to see how Ghana's transition to democracy will develop after more
than a decade of military rule. The government is engaged in a painful
battle to offset the fiscal and inflationary problems incurred in the run-up
to November's election which saw Jerry Rawlings declared civilian president.
Mr Botchwey has no illusions about achieving economic independence soon.
Ghana's persistent current account deficit is expected to be 6 per cent of
GDP this year. 'If you could assure me of an improvement in our terms of
trade, and a greater measure of debt forgiveness, then Ghana could wean
itself off aid in four to five years,' he says.
Nowhere in Africa are structural reforms so far advanced, and the
government's commitment so deeply rooted. But for Ghana to become Africa's
success story, it must take the qualitative leap into accelerated,
export-led growth. For now, it remains dependent on the patience of the
international donor community.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Arts: New light on a spirit of place - Why Pissarro's golden
period was sparked by simple necessity / Art Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to make too much of it, but a painter still tends to be known by
his subject matter. It follows that when a marked shift in an artist's
apparent interest should appear to have taken place we are only too ready to
speculate as to motive and intention, when really all that has happened is
that something fresh has caught his eye, a circumstance has changed, or a
natural extension of the work has proposed itself.
The point may seem obvious, but it needs to be made all the same in a time
when the literary and literal reading of art history would turn all painting
into history-painting and an annexe of social study.
The Impressionists - if the word retains any collective sense - turned their
attention to the particular play of light as it fell upon the world about
them and, by extension, found the generality of their material in what was
immediately to hand, mundane and everyday. If they looked to the nearer
landscape of suburban gardens and small-holdings on the edge of Paris that
even as they worked on them were being encroached upon by the growing city,
rather than to a countryside more remote and idealised, it was because that
was where they were. They saw a factory chimney in the distance rather than
a church tower, a railway engine rather than a horse and cart. And while
such details may fix the epoch for us with a peculiar poignancy, that is not
to say that it was ever the artist's conscious thought to do so.
Camille Pissarro, that most assiduous and archetypal of impressionists, with
his stated principles and socialist and anarchist leanings, has suffered
much lately by an over-sociological reading of his work. Even now, with this
magnificent exhibition at The Royal Academy, London, of the urban series of
his last years, we can sense the danger, with these high views over the
bridges and docks of Rouen and along the great boulevards of Paris, as
though to bring home to us the dehumanised, ant-like commerce and traffic of
the modern city.
And perhaps he did indulge from time to time in feelings of that sort - as
who has not. Perhaps he did offer up the rationale that he was looking to
the contrast of new and old, the conventionally ugly against the
picturesque, the questionable weight of tradition embodied in the Louvre as
he saw it rising above the trees of the Tuileries Gardens. But in front of
the actual works, so informed are they with a sense of immediate engagement
and excitement in the thing seen, such thoughts soon fall away, irrelevant
and hard to credit.
It cannot be emphasised enough that Pissarro was nothing if not a painter.
Painting is a very practical business, and whatever the nature of his
anticipatory notes or his post-facto ruminations, in front of the canvas it
is quite clear that the practice and the stuff of the paint absorbed him
utterly.
He was already 66, an elderly man, his sight failing, when in 1896 he
embarked on the first of these great series projects, the paintings of the
bridge and water-front at Rouen. The energy with which he sustained this
enterprise thereafter, in projects that often overlapped each other at
Rouen, le Havre, Dieppe and Paris, was extraordinary. Seven years on and
1903 saw him working variously at Dieppe, Paris and le Havre through the
spring and summer, and back in Paris in the autumn to complete the series of
views along the Quai Malaquais. Working to the last, he was taken ill and
died that November.
While such evident commitment was remarkable, the actual shift in
preoccupation, from the landscapes and rural genre subjects that
characterise his earlier career to these ambitious extended sequences of
cityscapes, was rather less so. Indeed, it seems perfectly reasonable. What
each series has in common is a high and consistent viewpoint, taken from the
balcony or window of an hotel or apartment deliberately chosen for the
purpose as temporary studio.
Come into somewhat more comfortable and reliable circumstances in his mature
career, the old man had not merely decided that the time had come for him to
work indoors, but had further realised that doing so would offer him, if
anything, even more scope in his address to the real and visible world. He
was not the first to paint the boulevards, the factories, the docks, nor yet
the first to work thus en serie, but this practical peripatetic combination
is his own.
And what a wonderful late achievement it produced and sustained. What we see
is almost a new artist, an artist at least renewed and refreshed, appearing.
The former insistent and systematic application of the paint, dab upon dab,
disappears, and as the handling of the paint grows ever more broad and free,
so the pictorial organisation, the underlying composition, grows ever
simpler and more authoritative.
Such is the structured practice and discipline, once assimilated to the
point of intuitive response, that truly frees the artist - any artist - to
do whatever it is he wants to do. And here, to see old Pissarro conjuring
the life of the Grands Boulevards, their cabs and buses, the horses stamping
at the stop and the crowd beneath the trees, out of the lightest stroke and
merest smudge of paint, is a pure delight.
The paintings of those Norman towns, Rouen, le Havre and Dieppe, with their
ports and markets, are well enough, but the purer visual pleasure and
excitement comes with the paintings of Paris. For here is the Paris we know,
for all that the streets are now full of cars and the pedestrian of
necessity less, well, pedestrian.
Here is the Avenue de l'Opera slushy as only Paris can be slushy in the
snow, the rue Saint Honore bright black and silver in the rain. Above all,
here is the Paris of crisp autumn days, the river hazy in a golden mist, the
bare trees bright in the sun, city of light.
Pissarro: the Impressionist and the City - The Sackler Galleries, The Royal
Academy, Piccadilly W1, until October 10. Sponsored by the Banque Indosuez
Group.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Arts: Hits and missed on their way to New York - Broadway
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You would think that Broadway would take a break after a season as dismal as
the one that has just ended - only 33 productions, down from 37 in the
fizzier 1991-92 season, and few gems among the dross. But hope springs
eternal on the street of dreams. Fifteen Broadway productions have already
reserved opening dates between now and December - a high figure this early
in the game. Not all these projects will get off the ground but at least 10
are serious contenders.
The trend in recent years has been for big productions to defer opening
until spring, to stay fresh in the minds of crusty Tony Award voters and
gain a box office boost at awards time in June. So why all these autumn 1993
openings? George Wachtel, director of research for the League of American
Theaters and Producers, says: 'Shows open when they're ready, spring or
fall.' A more cynical answer: seeing sparser autumns as a window of
opportunity to draw audiences that, presumably, exist year-round, producers
rushed in.
This autumn's offerings:
Perestroika: Tickets are on sale for the second half of Tony Kushner's
Angels in America, which joins the first, Millennium Approaches, in
repertory at the Walter Kerr Theatre in October. The Red Shoes: This new
musical is based on the 1947 film about a choreographer and the young
ballerina who is torn between her desire to dance for him and her love of
the composer of the Ballet of the Red Shoes. It reunites the Secret Garden
team of Marsha Norman (book and lyrics), Susan H Schulman (director) and
Heidi Landesman (settings). Jule Styne is writing the music and Lar Lubovich
will choreograph. It is scheduled to open in December at the Gershwin
Theatre with Roger Rees in a starring role.
Wonderful Tennessee: The new six-character play by Brian Friel, is scheduled
to bypass London and transfer straight from the Abbey Theatre in Dublin to
Broadway's Plymouth Theatre - where Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa had a
successful run - in October. It is being billed 'The Big Chill of Ireland.'
Cyrano - The Musical: The season's mystery production is slated to open at
the Neil Simon Theater in November. This adaptation of the Edmund Rostand
novel is imported from the Netherlands and is being translated into English
for New York. It will feature an American cast. The money comes from Dutch
television mogul Joop van den Ende, and clearly there is a lot of it: the
production took a full-page ad in the New York Times (Dollars 50,000) and
has started a television advertising campaign.
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat: Another mega-musical import
from Britain. Broadway will finally see the Steven Pimlott-directed Andrew
Lloyd Webber revival, the proportions of which are reportedly as biblical as
its subject matter. Michael Damian, the US equivalent of Jason Donovan,
plays the title role; it is to open at the Minskoff Theater in November.
The Kentucky Cycle: Robert Schenkkan's play spanning 200 years of US history
won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Like Angels in America, it is a
seven-hour epic split into two nights viewing. It comes to New York in
November after productions in Seattle, Los Angeles, and a try-out in
Washington, all directed by Warner Shook. Stacey Keach leads the 20-strong
cast.
My Fair Lady: This revival of the Lerner and Lowe musical, starring Richard
Chamberlain and directed by Howard Davies, is on a national tour. It is said
that Tommy Tune was called in to show-doctor, and Melissa Errico, the
newcomer playing Eliza Doolittle, has ruptured her vocal cords twice, but
the reviews have been positive. It is scheduled to reach New York in
December.
Laughter on the 23rd Floor: What would a Broadway season be without a new
Neil Simon show? Hopefully this will be better than last season's turkey,
The Goodbye Girl, a musical based on Simon's 1977 movie, which is still
running on the star power of Bernadette Peters and TV comedian Martin Short.
Laughter is a comic play set in the McCarthy era and is drawn from Simon's
experiences writing for television. Nathan Lane stars, and Jerry Zaks (Guys
and Dolls, Assassins, Six Degrees of Separation) directs. It is due to open
at the Richard Rogers Theatre in November after an out-of-town try-out.
Paper Moon: This new musical is based on the 1973 movie, which starred Ryan
and Tatum O'Neill, about a girl who teams up with a flim-flam man to swindle
their way across the 1930's countryside. The musical stars Gregory Harrison,
Christine Ebersole, and a soon-to-be-named child actress. Much depends on
the try-out at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey. If the word is good:
Broadway in late autumn.
Timon of Athens: Tony Randall's National Actors' Theatre's brief is
admirable: to present classic plays on Broadway. However, two seasons on, it
has hardly left the starting block, with production after ill-advised
production razed by the critics. But Randall is making a go of it for
another season. Shakespeare's late drama, is to open at the Lyceum Theatre
in November, directed by Michael Langham who directed the company's lone
success last season, Shaw's St Joan.
Already several big productions are planned for next spring and beyond. The
inaugural project of Walt Disney Theatrical Productions is a stage version
of Beauty and the Beast, the animated feature. Beauty's press representative
says the budget is Dollars 5m-Dollars 6m, but insiders put the figure
anywhere between Dollars 10m-Dollars 14m. The London production of Carousel
will open in New York in the spring with an American cast. Lloyd Webber will
follow his London opening of Sunset Boulevard with productions in LA in the
autumn and New York in the spring, all directed by Trevor Nunn. Patty
LuPone, Broadway's original Evita, will Norma Desmond in New York.
Fast on the heels of Kiss of the Spider Woman, producer Garth Drabinsky and
director Hal Prince are teaming up again for a revival of the 1927
Hammerstein and Kern musical Show Boat. It opens in October in Toronto where
it has already drawn protests from groups who find it racially offensive.
Its cast of 68 includes Elaine Stritch, Robert Morse, and Lonette McKee.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Arts: Murray the map-maker - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If jazz must continue to develop and find new ways - and there is not the
space to argue that out here - then let it be David Murray who holds the
map. More than any tenor saxophonist on the scene today, the 38-year-old
American makes bridges between all forms of jazz to arrive at a soulful and
contemporary sound which describes new and inviting horizons.
As a child and one of three sons on reeds, he performed alongside his
parents four nights a week and all day Sunday at the Missionary Church of
God in Christ in Oakland, California. As a grown-up in New York he has
preached hellfire harmolodics alongside James Blood Ulmer and worshipped in
every other musical faith, including the Catholic World Saxophone Quartet,
in between. And during this time he has also developed a bewitching,
alternately clipped and fluid technique on the bass clarinet.
At the Union Chapel on Sunday, leading a trio of Fred Hopkins on upright
bass and Andrew Cyrille on drums, Murray's easy drive and endlessly
unfurling cadenzas put me in mind of Sonny Rollins. The gusting notes and
rapidly exchanged high and low registers making new statements which however
abstract continued to swing articulately. As a writer and player he manages
to combine the tenor authority of Rollins with the freedom of ideas of
Ornette Coleman and the warmth of Ben Webster and still have a use for the
energy left over.
With Murray compositions such as Off Season, Walk Of the Stars and Hope
Scope, the Murray tenor wheedled and chimed, danced sweet and sour.
The bass clarinet sound too was a revelation, from pneumatic eructation to
velvet didgeridoo: Murray's fingering technique even extended to a
percussive effect which replicated a rhythmic Geiger counter.
If this trio setting provided a priceless opportunity to examine each Murray
phrase in all its pungency, it was also an unusual chance to hear Hopkins'
eccentric but plangent bass playing. Unconventional as a rhythm accompanist,
Hopkins can replace a funny sawing-the-bass-in-half routine with scary
stalking at the drop of a bow. Similarly, Cyrille, whose grounding is in
free jazz, can step down from screeching percussion to a blue walking rhythm
without a second thought.
Ten years ago, Village Voice critic Gary Giddins asked of Murray: 'What must
an exceptionally gifted American musician whose art falls between the shores
of the academy and the Top 40 do to get the hearing he deserves?' More of
the same is surely the simplest answer.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Arts: New music, old ideas - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that the former Almeida Music Festival has shrunk to a mere pendant for
the Almeida Opera season, we still hope - quite unrealistically - that it
will somehow distill the newest and liveliest music into its few allotted
slots. It can't, and doesn't. The non-operatic part of this year's programme
comprises just two concerts by the Brindisi Quartet, two potpourri piano
recitals, a recitation of Strauss's 'melodrama' Enoch Arden and a single
concert by Richard Bernas's Music Projects ensemble. Thus the latter, given
on Saturday, was so to speak the only broad-gauge exhibit - and it proved
discouragingly narrow.
It was well played, of course; the Bernas team's contributions always are.
What it signally failed to do was to suggest that anything of fresh interest
was going on. It concluded grimly with John Adams' 1982 Grand Pianola Music,
which now sounds like such a loud, protracted nullity as to undermine the
cleverer impression made by his more recent theatre-pieces. It is possible -
just - to imagine why it got a warm American welcome in its time, when pure
minimalism was beginning to seem a straitjacket.
What the 'grand pianola' plays, however, is minimalist textures (endlessly
repeated notes and figures, etc) without the fascination of slow, systematic
change that was the original point. Instead there are sudden, arbitrary
switches for variety's sake, with colourful patches which hark directly back
to Stravinsky, and for emphasis some blatant Hollywood effects (scored with
unblinking crudity). The total is far less than the sum of its parts. If
Yvar Mikhashoff's arrangements of some Conlon Nancarrow player-piano studies
seemed pleasant but unnecessary, Nancarrow's urgent, crabby sense of musical
purpose made Adams sound flabbily catch-as-catch-can.
Presumably the music of David Lang - represented here by Are You
Experienced? (after Jimi Hendrix, with Lang delivering his own winsomely
fragmentary narration) and his recent Orpheus Over and Under, with a
'music-drama' soon to come - answers to some current felt need in New York.
One can only guess at what that might be; in London both pieces sounded
desperately thin and wispy, without even Adams' showmanship to brighten
their inconsequent progress. In this company Vic Hoyland's new Chamber
Concerto (an Almeida Opera commission) at least evinced the marks of
thoughtful construction, hard-edged and unappetising though it was.

For the past couple of years it has been very cheap to make movies in the
countries of the former communist bloc, and now they are beginning to arrive
on screen. An Exchange Of Fire is a two-part thriller set in Prague and
London, starring Frank Finlay as 'the ruthless head of a terrorist cell'.
The president of an east European state sends his daughter to the west where
she becomes mixed up in a kidnap plot . . . you get the picture. Part 2 is
screened tomorrow evening (10.00 C4).
First Tuesday investigates 'the worst terrorist outrage of the Anglo-Irish
troubles': the explosion of four car bombs in Dublin and Monaghan 19 years
ago. There were 33 deaths and nearly 300 were injured, but nobody has ever
been arrested for the crimes, let alone convicted. The producers promise to
'reveal the hidden truths behind the bombings and explain why details have
been buried', so it does not sound as though they will be saying who did it
(10.40 ITV).
BBC2 begins a new series about environmental issues: Nature (8.00) starting
with a report on possible health risks arising from the fluoridation of
water.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Way out of the time warp -
Recommendations for a new approach to litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the eve of publication of the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice, set up two years ago after a damaging series of miscarriages of
justice, the Bar and the Law Society have produced a damning indictment of
the civil justice system.
The verdict of a joint committee of barristers and solicitors, led by Ms
Hilary Heilbron QC and Mr Henry Hodge of London solicitors Hodge Jones &amp;
Allen, is that civil justice in England is trapped in a Dickensian time
warp. Victorian court buildings remain unmodernised. The use of new
technology is negligible - virtually all court documents and records are
compiled manually. Court procedures are technical, inflexible, riddled with
rules and often incomprehensible to litigants. The language of the law is
wordy, archaic and littered with unintelligible and largely irrelevant
jargon. Delay is widespread, leading to ever increasing costs, and
frustrating the efficient conduct of commerce and industry.
This verdict is all the more worrying as it comes just two years after the
implementation of the government's reforms to speed up and improve the
efficiency of civil justice by streamlining the jurisdiction of the High
Court and county courts.
Companies involved in litigation find it a protracted, cumbersome and
increasingly expensive exercise. The cost of a two-year commercial dispute
culminating in a one or two-month trial can run into millions of pounds. Yet
litigation is on the increase. The Centre for Interfirm Comparison, an
independent research group, says that on average London law firms reported a
25 per cent growth in litigation in 1992, on top of an average 43 per cent
rise in 1991.
Given this unpalatable fact, few businesses will be happy to learn from the
Heilbron/Hodge report that much blame for the expense of resolving
commercial disputes lies with the civil justice system.
They will therefore welcome the report's conclusion that there is an urgent
need for 'a radical reappraisal of the approach to litigation' in England
and 'for many of the deeply ingrained traditions to be swept away and
replaced by pragmatic and modern attitudes and ideas'.
The report makes a number of suggestions for change in the civil justice
system: restructuring the High Court, widespread introduction of new
technology, the creation of more specialised courts such as the commercial
court, and simplified procedures and court documents, expressed in plain
English.
But by far the most significant suggestion for achieving this shift in
approach is the recommendation that the government should establish a pilot
scheme for Alternative Dispute Resolution in one or two civil court centres.
ADR has its origins in the far east, where it has been used for more than 30
years, and in the US. The Heilbron/Hodge report estimates that about 10 per
cent of cases in the US are now resolved by ADR. About one-third of American
states now have comprehensive plans for court-based ADR and there are
approximately 1,200 ADR schemes receiving referrals from state courts.
Some US schemes indicate a settlement rate as high as 50 per cent, and a
substantial number of courts have introduced rules requiring lawyers to
inform their clients of available ADR processes early in the litigation
process.
ADR takes various forms: mediation, conciliation or mini-trial. But common
to all these forms is the fact that they are non-binding; if ADR does not
work, or resolution proves impossible, the parties are still free to
litigate.
In the UK, where ADR commonly takes the form of mediation, companies have
slowly begun to embrace the concept. Since the Centre for Dispute Resolution
(CEDR), an industry-backed, non-profit-making organisation, was set up in
1990 to promote the use of ADR in the UK, almost 250 disputes involving more
than Pounds 800m have been referred to it. Of these, 25 per cent went on to
complete formal ADR processes. The centre estimates that more than Pounds
30m in potential legal costs has been saved - and considerably more than
that, if the saving in management time is included.
But, despite these signs, and support from industry and consumer groups such
as the National Consumer Council, ADR has not yet had the impact in the UK
that it could have.
Dr Karl Mackie, the CEDR's director, believes that part of the reason for
the slow take-up of ADR is the 'traditional adversarial mindset and culture
of lawyers and clients in litigation'. The Heilbron/Hodge report agrees.
'The legal system and those who participate in it have shown a marked
reluctance to take advantage of its potential benefits,' it says.
For ADR to work in the UK and produce savings for the civil justice system,
it needs to be extended beyond commercial disputes to cover all civil
litigation, in particular personal injury actions. This means that it will
require government support, as the majority of personal injury actions are
brought by legally aided plaintiffs.
Some time ago a group including the Bar, the Law Society and the CEDR
proposed to the Lord Chancellor's department that a court-annexed ADR pilot
scheme be run in Bristol. The proposal was not taken up - largely, it seems,
because in the current economic climate the government is reluctant to
increase public expenditure on legal aid by extending it to ADR processes.
It is also worried about the lack of evidence that ADR could produce savings
for the legal aid fund by encouraging the earlier settlement of cases.
The Heilbron/Hodge report believes the government's fears are overplayed. If
ADR produces earlier settlement of a dispute than would otherwise be the
case, the saving in costs can be substantial, it says. Even where ADR only
succeeds in narrowing the issues at dispute, rather than achieving a
settlement, costs can be saved. And if costs to the legal aid fund can be
saved by ADR, then the case for extending legal aid to cover ADR processes
is unanswerable.
In the end, the report says, the only way the Lord Chancellor and the
Treasury will be satisfied that ADR can produce savings is to generate
enough data to allow a proper evaluation. And the only way that can be
achieved is by establishing a pilot scheme at one or two court centres. If
the government wants long-term savings, it must expect some short-term
expenditure, Ms Heilbron says.
The establishment of a successful court-annexed ADR scheme can only
encourage the development of ADR in other spheres. The Commercial Court is
considering the introduction of a form of court-annexed mediation that is
likely to prove popular with its foreign clients. A City Disputes Panel for
banking and financial services is being set up and should be in operation
this year, providing both mediation and arbitration services. But, without
government support, the civil justice system will continue to be denied the
overall benefits and savings that ADR can bring.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Treaty question - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has intervened in a preliminary reference from the
English High Court to the European Court of Justice which raises questions
about the direct applicability of the competition rules of the European Coal
and Steel Community (ECSC) treaty.
The question arose in an action brought by H J Banks &amp; Co against British
Coal alleging that the state-owned coal company had charged excessively high
royalties in its licensing of private coal producers to extract coal.
According to Mr Stephen Kon, a partner with solicitors S J Berwin which is
representing the Commission, this is the first time in 40 years that the
question has arisen as to whether the ECSC treaty gives rise to individual
rights in the national courts.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Revenues fall at top US firms, survey
shows - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fortunes of America's top law firms are on the wane, according to a
survey of their 1992 earnings.
Four of the top 10 firms, ranked by turnover, showed a fall in gross
revenues, according to the survey by The American Lawyer magazine. The four
include New York's Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, which was displaced at
the top of the table by Baker &amp; McKenzie, the largest law firm in the world.
Skadden's gross revenues in 1992 were Dollars 440m, down Dollars 50m on
1991, while Baker's gross revenues increased from Dollars 477m in 1991 to
Dollars 503.5m in 1992.
Skadden also suffered a fall in average profits per partner, from Dollars
930,000 in 1991 to Dollars 885,000. The most profitable firms in the top 10
are Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, with profits per partner of Dollars 1.08m on
turnover of Dollars 270m, and Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell with profits per partner
of Dollars 1.02m on a turnover of Dollars 267m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Clegg, co-chairman of Daiwa Europe, is taking on the chairmanship
of Daiwa Europe Bank when Geoffrey Taylor, 65, retires at the end of July.
After 22 years at Hill Samuel, Clegg, 57, joined Daiwa as a managing
director in 1986. With fluent French, German, Dutch and 'dormant Russian',
he has been involved in Daiwa's expansion into continental Europe, including
Hungary and Russia.
Taylor, who had been chief executive of Midland between 1982 and 1986, had
been chairman, in a non-executive capacity, since the Japanese bank first
obtained its licence in 1987. He stays on as a non-executive director and as
a member of the audit committee.
The bank does only a limited amount of straight lending business, its main
thrust being foreign exchange, derivatives and financial engineering as well
as offshore banking out of Dublin.
While all four of the big Japanese securities houses have a European banking
off-shoot, it is unusual for the most senior European in the securities
house also to run the bank.

FT  06 JUL 93 / People: Wileman to find 'a vision for Sears'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears, the retail group that includes the Selfridges department store and
chains such as Olympus, Miss Selfridge, Warehouse, and Adams, is splitting
the role of corporate development director - which had become 'too big for
one person' - to create a new post of strategy director.
The man brought in to fill the post by chief executive Liam Strong is Andrew
Wileman, 39, until now head of the retail practice at OC&amp;C, the strategy
consultancy. Strong was impressed by Wileman when OC&amp;C was carrying out
consultancy work for Sears.
Although the position is not at board level, Wileman will work closely with
Strong on 'coming up with a vision for Sears', the group says.
The task of restructuring Sears has been likened to turning round a
flotilla, but Strong has had some success since arriving in February 1992.
He has sold the group's menswear interests and the property arm Galliford,
and rationalised the British Shoe Corporation.
Wileman's job now, working closely with Jonathan Katz, the present corporate
development director, will be to oversee the next phase: focusing on the
retailing operations and making sure shops and products are in tune with
what customers want.
Wileman is expected to take a long-term view of strategy, looking at new
ventures, and also at improving Sears' 'core retail skills' - including
customer service, product sourcing, visual merchandising and marketing. Katz
will be in charge of implementing the group's new operating plan.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Japanese car decision annulled -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of First Instance last week annulled a decision of the
European Commission not to pursue five complaints relating to the sale of
Japanese cars in France. The Court said, in making its decision, the
Commission had committed legal errors in its appreciation of EC competition
rules.
In the 1980s certain Japanese car importers had agreed with the French
government to limit their sales in France to 3 per cent of the French market
and 15 per cent of the Martinique market. In exchange for this voluntary
restraint, the French agreed the importers should have exclusive access to
these quotas. Complaints were lodged by five other importers, alleging the
agreement was in breach of EC competition rules.
Six years after the first complaint was lodged, the Commission said it would
not pursue the complaints because the agreement was an integral part of
French policy on the importation of Japanese cars. The Commission added that
the importers had had no margin for manoeuvre at the time they entered into
the agreement, and that the application of EC competition rules would not
give the complainants a remedy in the sense of access to the quota of
imported Japanese cars.
The Court said that, in cases such as this where the Commission had a power
of appraisal, that power had to be exercised with the greatest respect for
procedural guarantees, such as the obligation to examine with care and
impartiality the particular elements of the relevant case.
The Court said that documentary evidence showed that the importers covered
by the agreement had agreed among themselves to divide up the quota. The
Commission had seen that documentary evidence before it reached its decision
not to pursue the complaints. The agreement to divide the quotas was an
agreement which fell within the scope of Rome treaty competition rules.
The Court said there was no evidence the partition of the market had been
forced on the importers by the French as the Commission had said. The
Commission had committed an error of appraisal in concluding the importers
had no margin of manoeuvre with regard to the agreement.
It also ruled that it was the agreement to partition the market, rather than
the specific national rules, which was responsible for the lack of access to
the market. Applying EC competition rules to the agreement could well have
given the complainants access to the market.

Interim measures refused in banana case
An application from Germany for interim measures to exclude it temporarily
from the new common organisation in the market for bananas was refused by
the European Court last week.
Germany argued that, by setting quotas for bananas from dollar countries
while allowing duty-free access to the Community for bananas from African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, the rules of the common organisation
were unlawful. Germany said they breached EC competition and agriculture
rules, the principle of non-discrimination and the Gatt rules.
The Court said these arguments were not completely unjustified.
Germany also argued it should be excluded from the rules, as otherwise it
would suffer irreparable harm: as the volume of bananas dropped, the price
would rise. This would have a significant effect not only on individual
consumers but also on people and firms connected with the banana trade.
The Court said that, in the event that the quota proved insufficient for
Germany's needs, there were provisions in the common organisation to remedy
such a problem. Given this, and arguments put on behalf of France, Spain,
Portugal and the UK that the exemption of Germany from the regime would lead
to intolerable consequences for the ACP producer countries which could lead
to social unrest, the Court ruled that Germany's application should be
refused.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): ABC of business plan
writing - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many small and medium-sized businesses rely on the founder's instincts
rather than formal planning. Practical Business Planning, a booklet* by
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, provides an introduction to a subject
overlooked by many business owners.
Aimed mainly at the medium-sized company seeking outside funds, it is also
of relevance to smaller businesses and start-ups.
Written business plans must be interesting to read and the main text should
be no longer than 20 pages, the authors suggest. If the plan is intended for
outsiders it must take account of their needs.
Obey the ABC rule - for accuracy, brevity and clarity - and avoid jargon.
Well designed graphs, charts and tables can replace large amounts of text.
Avoid unusual type-faces and page lay-outs.

The Department of Trade and Industry will no longer provide financial
backing to help companies implement recommendations from consultants
employed under the Enterprise Initiative.
The aim is to save the Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m annual cost of implementation
guidance and devote it to subsidising the enterprise initiative proper.
The enterprise initiative provides half of the cost - two-thirds in some
parts of the country - of up to 15 days of consultants' advice in areas such
as marketing, quality and financial management. Implementation guidance
consists of a discretionary extra five days of subsidy.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Visiting time for TECs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) should drop
across-the-board schemes of business support and concentrate on business
sectors where growth prospects are best. They must also become more active
in visiting small business owners at their premises instead of waiting for
them to contact the TEC. These are the two main recommendations to emerge
from a study* of the TECs by Kingston University.
A nationwide network of TECs was set up in 1990-91 to provide training and
support for small businesses locally. But a number of surveys have shown
that TECs are failing to reach many of the small businesses in their areas.
Some businesses confuse the title with 'tech', for technical college, while
many TECs cover large geographical areas with a mix of different local
economies and communities.
Business representatives on TEC boards are drawn mainly from large
companies; many owners of small businesses cannot devote the time required.
A further problem is that TECs inherited many 'pre-packaged' government
support schemes such as the enterprise allowance scheme and business growth
training, which are seen as irrelevant by many businesses. Most TECs
subcontract the actual provision of services to organisations such as
enterprise agencies and management consultants. 'The problem here is that
neither has proved popular with small business owners in the past,' says the
study.
Closer links might be established with industry training organisations and
trade associations, the study suggests. Visiting companies is expensive and
time consuming but the best way of reaching small firms, it notes.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Return to tender - New
legislation which should make it easier to secure EC public-sector contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Envopak Group, a manufacturer of reusable mail pouches and mail room
equipment, has had mixed experience of selling to public authorities in
continental Europe.
'We have had fewer successes than failures,' admits Ric Skoulding,
international director of the Sidcup, Kent-based company. Even for a
business which has been exporting for nearly 30 years and which achieves a
quarter of its Pounds 15m turnover overseas, the tendering process for
public-sector contracts is fraught with difficulties.
'You only have to fail on one point and you are out,' says Skoulding.
Undeterred by these problems, Envopak has been honing its techniques. 'We
have been building up a fund of information and we will be ready for the
next one.'
One lesson Envopak has learned is the importance of having a good local
source of information, in the shape of a distributor or agent, on
forthcoming tenders so as to be able to respond in time. A recent invitation
to supply mail sacks to the German Post Office did not leave enough time to
research the materials and produce samples.
It is to overcome at least some of the problems associated with winning
foreign tenders that a raft of new European Community legislation has been
introduced over the past five years. No fewer than six directives have been
passed to open up public procurement markets.
The aim is to extend the workings of the single market to the public sector
by preventing governments, local authorities and the water, transport and
power companies from discriminating against foreign suppliers. The often
secretive tendering process is being opened up and buyers are being forced
to apply objective criteria in choosing suppliers.
'One of the purposes of the directives is to sever the link between the
politicians and the buying decision,' comments Jeremy Miles, chairman of
Quasar Microwave Technology, which exports 60 per cent of its Pounds 3m
turnover.
Previous attempts to open up the public procurement market, which accounts
for no less than 15 per cent of the European Community's domestic product,
achieved only limited success because the rules for enforcement were
inadequate. The latest legislation is backed by tougher compliance
directives and, while most companies are reluctant to go to court against
potential customers, lawyers report an increase in litigation in this area.
The latest directive, covering public services, took effect in the UK as
recently as last week, on July 1. UK legislation covering public works,
supplies and utilities, both publicly and privately-owned, was introduced
earlier while an extension of the utilities directive, to cover services as
well as works and supplies, is due to take effect in July 1994.
Key to the new regime is the requirement that public authorities publish the
details of their contracts. This they are obliged to do in the S series of
the EC's Official Journal, available on subscription. The information is
also available through an EC electronic database, Tenders Electronic Daily,
which classifies contract notices by product and industry.
The publication of tender information occurs at three stages in the life of
a contract. Periodic indicative notices (PINs) provide advance warning of
forthcoming tenders. These are followed by details of individual contracts.
Finally, an announcement that a contract has been awarded must be made
within 48 days.
Under the new directives public authorities must provide enough information
for all potential bidders to take part and must not use, for example,
trademarks which would exclude some suppliers. Technical specifications must
not be used to exclude bidders and if a European standard exists it must be
used.
Progress towards this goal is still only partial, reports Ian Anderson,
general sales manager of Houseman, a supplier of water treatment systems.
Some contracts still specify membership of a national professional body or
certification by a particular organisation, he says.
To avoid imposing an impossible burden on public authorities the EC has set
minimum thresholds for contracts which must be publicised. Works contracts
valued at less than Ecu5m (Pounds 3.5m) need not be notified. A threshold of
Ecu 200,000 applies to supplies contracts unless they are awarded by a
utility, in which case the threshold is Ecu 400,000 (Ecu 600,000 for
telecommunications contracts). For services contracts a minimum of Ecu
200,000 applies.
The temptation for public authorities and utilities would be to break up
contracts to keep them below the thresholds, though EC lawmakers have
attempted to prevent this.
Repair work on different parts of the same building would probably have to
be aggregated into a single contract but a contract to repair buildings
spread over different faculties of a university campus might be considered
separate contracts.
'The authority must make a sensible decision based on whether the works are
close enough together in place or time or if they would all be handled by
one main contractor,' Mark Lane, a partner of solicitors Masons, told a
conference arranged by ICM Marketing last week.
Public authorities must also decide on which of the three possible
procedures they will follow. They have a choice of the open procedure,
whereby all interested contractors or suppliers may submit a tender; the
restricted procedure, when only invited suppliers may tender; and the
negotiated procedure, whereby the authority consults suppliers of its choice
and negotiates the terms of the contract with one or more of them.
If the purchaser is a utility it has greater freedom in its choice of
procedure providing it has published a contract notice, a PIN or details of
any pre-qualification system it operates. This is an area where the European
Commission's desire for more open public procurement clashes with the wish
on the part of many utilities to develop closer links with chosen suppliers,
sometimes known as 'partnership sourcing' agreements.
Utilities are allowed to operate qualification systems for would-be
contractors or suppliers, providing they are based on objective criteria.
Once the purchaser has assessed all the bids it must then award the contract
either on the basis of the lowest price or 'the most economically
advantageous' tender. This allows the public authority or utility to take
into account more subjective factors but the criteria used must be
published, where possible in descending order of importance, Lane suggests.
Abnormally low bids may not be rejected without the purchaser having first
found out why the bid was so low.
Even after these legislative changes, tendering for cross-border
public-sector contracts can be a daunting process.
Independent Facility Management, a Berkshire-based company which provides
building consultancy and management services, first looked at the European
contracts market in earnest in February and now subscribes to the Official
Journal.
But the company, which employs 29 people and has fee income of Pounds 1.4m,
has focused its efforts on breaking into the UK public contracts market. 'We
have concentrated on getting our name in front of as many government
departments as possible,' says James Whitehouse, sales director.
'We would tender for an overseas contract if one came up but would then face
the language problem and the cost of attending interviews in continental
Europe. It would be a poor use of our resources to tackle Europe when we
have yet to develop our home market.'
It may well make sense for companies new to public-sector markets to start
at home. But in the longer term, if the EC's initiative is successful, a
very large European market place will be opened up.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Technology: Disillusioned with computers - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TORGUN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASPIRING young writers get tired of running out of pads and ball-points. So
perhaps it was a good idea of my father's to let me use the Amstrad notebook
computer which he had recently acquired. Then again, perhaps it wasn't.
The computer, the NC100, is amazingly simple to understand and very light.
It is perfect for times when you don't want to have to sit at your desk to
write. There are no hassles saving files and storing them; everything is
saved automatically. It can go pretty much everywhere with you.
Initially, it seemed perfect. But problems - of the type which can affect
any potential computer purchaser wanting a machine which combines low cost
with ease of operation and some flexibility - soon occurred. The Amstrad
(costing nearly Pounds 200) has a limited amount of storage - only enough
for eight or so files ranging from one to three pages. For more space, you
have to buy plug-in cards costing at least Pounds 40, too expensive for a
15-year-old student in the middle of her GCSE years.
The other options are printing out every document or decanting them on to
another computer with a larger memory.
Both of these options have their difficulties. First, printing all your work
out is useless, because the idea of using a computer is to have all your
work in storage.
Second, decanting files can be a problem. Where do you get another computer
from? If it is your father's computer, what do you do if you need to see a
file instantly and he is not around.
It was around a month after I started using the Amstrad that I ran into
serious problems. The computer went blank - pointlessly, infuriatingly
blank. What had happened? This remains a mystery. After a few days of
carefully checking it, shaking it and, eventually, screaming wildly at it,
my father and I decided to send it back to Amstrad to be fixed, all the time
praying that the files I had worked on for more than a month would be safe.
They were not. The computer was sent back to us fully working but fully
wiped of all my work.
It was a long time before I could face using it again and when I did
everything seemed fine. Although I had lost all my files and had no record
of them, I built my work up again, slowly and painstakingly.
And then disaster struck again. I wrote a short piece - only two paragraphs,
in fact. I put in a final full stop . . . and it started to beep . . . beep
. . . beep. I got worried. Again, I sought advice but the instruction book
did not mention high-pitched beeping. The only way to solve this seemed to
be to remove the batteries. This we did . . . and all my files were rubbed.
Again.
I never want to see this computer again. My father understands this and
introduced me to the Olivetti Quaderno. The Quaderno (Pounds 585) is
beautiful, much more attractive than the Amstrad. It has a larger memory,
too, but it also takes memory cards - the same expensive memory cards.
(These cost between Pounds 40 for 64K bytes, or 20 pages of text, and Pounds
150 for one megabyte, or 320 pages.)
The Quaderno has more functions. These include a tape recorder (for when you
have sudden brain waves and don't have time to type them out), a calculator,
address book and organiser. It takes longer to understand and it has a much
smaller keyboard which is harder to type on.
With the Amstrad, I lost in total over six months' work and I have given up
on the Quaderno, because school work means I do not have time to learn to
use it properly. I'm sure that with a little time and patience it would be
good . . . but not for someone who just wants to write rather than learn
about computers.
As for me, I'm going to have to spend a large amount of money on ball-points
and pads. At least they do not take ages to learn to use or break down when
you least want them to.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Technology: Lure of the city lights - Smith &amp; Nephew defied
convention by relocating R&amp;D from country home to science park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE conventional wisdom 30 years ago was that researchers worked best in
peaceful isolation. Many UK companies tried to give them peace and quiet by
converting country houses in idyllic landscapes into laboratories.
In the 1990s, however, isolation is out and interaction is in. According to
today's ideas, the perfect setting for a corporate laboratory is a
university science park, where researchers can collaborate easily with
fellow scientists.
Most companies stay put in their existing country house laboratories,
however, imagining that a move would be prohibitively expensive and
disruptive. The exception is Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare group, which has
just transferred its research centre from Gilston Park, an early Victorian
mansion in rural Essex, to a new building on York Science Park.
S&amp;N did, of course, incur substantial direct costs - at least Pounds 2.5m
for moving all its staff and equipment to York plus Pounds 5.5m for fitting
out the research centre. (The 83,000 sq ft building was put up by York
Science Park, a joint venture between the university and P&amp;O Developments,
and rented as a shell to S&amp;N)
The indirect costs of disrupted projects and distracted staff are not known.
'We have different views on how much dislocation there has been but I would
say it amounted to six months of research on average,' says Alan Suggett,
R&amp;D director.
'We took some of our best scientists to be (relocation) project
co-ordinators - which they did very well - but we underestimated the amount
of time involved. If we did it again, I would probably have used more
external consultants, so as to preserve our research programme.'
The total costs of the move, then, can be put at a minimum of Pounds 10m, or
twice the annual budget of the group research centre. (S&amp;N spent a total of
Pounds 25m on R&amp;D last year - Pounds 5m centrally and the remainder by its
operating businesses.)
But John Robinson, chief executive, says the benefits far outweigh the
costs. 'This was not just about moving to a building designed for the next
century rather than the last. It is about creating a new research culture.'
The reasons for leaving Gilston Park included: poor communications;
out-of-date facilities that could not be improved easily because of planning
constraints; security problems on the country house estate; and, above all,
the difficulty of recruiting and retaining good staff.
The attractions of York are: the university's highly rated research, which
is not exploited by other science-based companies; the city's excellent
international image; and proximity to S&amp;N's main UK manufacturing base in
Hull.
At the same time, S&amp;N took advantage of the move both to refocus research
more closely on its fast-growing core businesses and to introduce a new
management structure.
The refocusing involves running down research in consumer products (such as
the well-known Elastoplast brand in the UK) and in pharmaceuticals - an
activity in which S&amp;N cannot hope to compete with the large drug companies.
The funds are being redirected to five strategic growth areas: orthopaedic
implants; wound management products (such as hospital dressings and gels);
minimally invasive surgery; casting and bandaging; and surgeons' gloves.
In place of the previous management hierarchy, the new research centre has a
flat 'matrix' structure. Line managers are responsible for departments such
as chemical and biological sciences, while programme managers handle
specific projects like wound management research. 'We've also introduced a
'scientific ladder' which enables senior scientists to have equal status to
managers, in terms of benefits and so on,' says Gareth Lloyd-Jones, research
director.
Strategic control of R&amp;D rests with a Research Steering Group chaired by the
chief executive, which meets twice a year. Its members include Suggett,
Lloyd-Jones and the heads of the operating businesses. Outside input comes
from a Scientific Advisory Panel of five university researchers chaired by
Nancy Lane, a Cambridge University biologist who is a non-executive director
of S&amp;N. It also meets twice a year, to provide an independent review of the
corporate research programme. 'We act as an auditing body, giving the
company feedback on the areas where it is weak and on the strengths that it
can build on,' she says.
One scientist familiar with S&amp;N research says: 'They have some catching up
to do; they're still a bit sleepy Essex villagey.' But Lane thinks that
comment is unfair: 'The work is good now and will become excellent in the
new laboratory.'
The building in York was designed to be as flexible as possible, in contrast
to Gilston Park. 'We decided to make the labs interchangeable, so that we
could change the research programme overnight if we had to,' says Suggett.
The main laboratories are arranged on two floors, on both sides of a wide
central aisle - the 'write-up area' where the scientists have their desks
and can sit with colleagues to gossip or discuss work. There is a separate
product development lab where engineers build pilot manufacturing lines.
S&amp;N employed 220 people at Gilston Park and has 180 working at York; the job
cuts were among support services such as maintenance, security and cleaning.
About 90 people made the move from Essex last autumn - only 18 months after
the relocation was announced - 'and fortunately these included almost all of
our key professional staff,' Suggett says. That left another 90 to be
recruited locally, mainly technicians and secretarial staff.
'What we were asking people to do was, in effect, to make a personal
commitment to Smith &amp; Nephew for the next few years,' he adds. Although
family commitments prevented some people moving, others took the opportunity
to leave S&amp;N because they had been uncertain about their long-term future
with the company.
Jack Fennimore, the S&amp;N chief technologist who managed the relocation
project, says external advisers had predicted that only 50 to 60 would agree
to move. Robinson had said he would be happy if 80 moved.
Lane, who also chairs the UK government committee on women in science, was
particularly pleased that S&amp;N lost very few of its female researchers.
Several of them persuaded their partners to move with them to York.
Interaction between S&amp;N and the university - a prime reason for the
company's move - is already getting under way, says Tony Robards, professor
of applied biology. Informal early exchanges between the academic and
corporate labs are leading to more formal arrangements, such as sharing of
expensive equipment and placements of S&amp;N staff to train with academic
specialists. Joint research projects under the government's Link and
Teaching Company schemes are also in prospect.
Will other companies follow S&amp;N's example? One candidate might be Johnson
Matthey, the UK metals group, which has a similar-sized research centre
based at Blount's Court, a country house in rural Oxfordshire. 'We have
talked about moving many times; the subject comes up every two years or so
but we just don't think it's worth the cost and effort,' says George
McGuire, Johnson Matthey research director. 'We like it here.'
But Robinson is convinced that for S&amp;N the move was worth the effort. 'It
has given a new excitement about R&amp;D to the whole group worldwide.'

FT  06 JUL 93 / Birt urged to press on with BBC management reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, has been advised by the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation to persevere with the controversial Producer Choice
policy.
Mr David Hill, managing director of the ABC, told Mr Birt in a meeting in
London last week that a similar scheme introduced four years ago at his
broadcasting organisation had been 'a dramatic and remarkable success'.
Producer Choice, launched at the BBC in April, provides for the full costing
of all programmes and gives producers the right to buy in services from the
outside market.
The Australian version is called User Pays. Mr Hill said that since the
scheme started four years ago there had been a 20 per cent increase in
productivity at the ABC. The number of staff had also fallen from 6,500 to
5,500.
In 1989-90, Mr Hill said, 2.3m resource hours were used to produce
programmes. In 1992-3 the total was 1.8m, yet in the same time the number of
hours transmitted increased by 6 per cent.
Mr Hill pointed out, however, that the Australian scheme was phased in more
gradually and producers had to get permission before buying in services from
outside.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith calls for rethink of G7 role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for a radical rethink of the role and institutional status of the G7
industrial nations was made yesterday by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.
Speaking on the eve of the Tokyo summit at a meeting of the socialist
international, he said the G7 had degenerated into an 'over-hyped
photo-opportunity', losing in the process its ambition to be a serious point
of international decision-making.
Citing the group's failure over four consecutive years to give a substantive
impetus to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, Mr Smith said that its
failure to follow up publicly-stated agreements had weakened its authority.
But more fundamentally the G7 should review its membership criteria and its
relationship with United Nations-related agencies such as the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Mr Smith said the present members should consider 'folding' the G7 into an
economic equivalent of the UN Security Council with a slightly larger
membership which would not be drawn exclusively from the industrialised
world. Such a move could enhance the credibility of international policy
co-ordination while satisfying Japan's desire for greater participation in
decision-making by the UN.
Mr Smith said that the group should in the meantime set as its first
priority agreement on firm steps to strengthen growth and employment. He
said a further co-ordinated reduction in borrowing costs was needed to boost
demand in the G7 countries.

FT  06 JUL 93 / ITV digs in over News at Ten scheduling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies yesterday declined to back down publicly over the
scheduling of News at Ten in spite of the political furore caused by
proposals to move it to an early evening slot.
The ITV Council, which brings together the chief executives of the 15
regional ITV companies, decided it wanted to meet the Independent Television
Commission 'to review the extensive research on this issue and its
commercial implications'.
In a carefully worded statement the ITV companies said they wanted to
explore different interpretations of the 1990 Broadcasting Act over the
scheduling of news programmes.
The future of News at Ten will be discussed by the ITC on July 14 at the
previously scheduled annual meeting between the members of the commission
and the chief executives of ITV.
There is no sign, however, that the ITC is prepared to compromise on the
issue. The commission, which saw yesterday's ITV statement as a face-saving
exercise, will stick to its line that no change in the scheduling of News at
Ten is possible without its approval.
It is difficult to see what ITV can do, even though it has a strong legal
opinion that the ITC does not have the right to specify a particular time
for the main evening news other than 'prime time' between 6.30pm and 10pm.
To force the issue forward ITV would have to decide unilaterally to move
News at Ten.
The companies would then almost certainly face stiff fines from the ITC for
breaches of their licences. Only then could they challenge the ITC in the
High Court by seeking a judicial review of such a deci-sion.
In spite of yesterday's show of defiance the odds are that News at Ten will
stay where it is for the forseeable future.
ITV company Yorkshire-Tyne Tees is to axe 188 jobs as part of a cost-cutting
drive, it announced yesterday.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Teachers continue boycott of tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO largest teachers' unions yesterday said members would continue
boycotting national curriculum tests in September.
This intensifies pressure for drastic changes to the tests. A review being
conducted by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman designate of the Schools Curriculum
and Assessment Authority, is expected to produce preliminary conclusions at
the end of the month.
Boycotts by the three main teachers' unions this year meant that scarcely
any pupils took the tests.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, made clear his union would end the
boycott if the review cut their workload significantly. 'The government
could solve this problem by either slimming down the national curriculum
immediately or by limiting the number of hours teachers could be called to
work.'
He indicated possible disagreement between the unions by saying the boycott
would end even if Sir Ron recommended introducing simple externally marked
'paper and pencil tests'.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said
his union was taking action on educational content as well as workload.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Six Tories back Labour on pits plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT secured a majority of 22 in the Commons last night to shrug
off a revolt by six Tory backbenchers who voted for a Labour motion
condemning the closure of pits which were expected to secure a reprieve
through increased sales of coal for electricity generation.
In a hard-hitting speech Mr Winston Churchill (C Davyhulme) attacked the
government for not providing any evidence that it had the will or
determination to widen the market for coal.
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (C Batley and Spen), Mr Richard Alexander (C Newark),
Mr William Cash (C Stafford), Mrs Ann Winterton (C Congleton) and Mr
Nicholas Winterton (C Macclesfield) also voted against the government.
Several Conservative MPs abstained.
The Labour motion, which claimed that the government had encouraged the
belief that 12 pits facing early closure would be reprieved, was defeated by
308 votes to 286.
A government amendment backing the introduction of legislation to privatise
British Coal was carried by a majority of 22 (307-285).
In closing a boisterous debate Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, sought to
placate the Tory critics by stressing that the government would support the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers in organising employee-management buyouts.
He said the government would provide 50 per cent - up to a maximum of Pounds
200,000 - of the costs incurred by each employee-management team in engaging
consultants and advisers to enable them to compete with other bidders.
Mr Eggar claimed jeers by Labour MPs sponsored by the National Union of
Mineworkers showed that they were not interested in Nottingham miners having
a chance to buy the pits in which they worked.
He told those Tory MPs who were critical of the electricity generators for
refusing to sell unwanted coal-fired stations at a price below the cost of
new gas fired installations that the director-general of electricity
regulation was reviewing the matter.
Responding to demands that the government should increase the demand for
coal by requiring the electricity generators to limit the rundown of their
stockpile of 33m tons Mr Eggar warned that whatever decision was reached it
would be unlikely to make a significant impact for at least the next few
months.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, insisted that government had not given
any guarantee that the 12 pits could be saved.
Shadow trade secretary Mr Robin Cook argued that with the market 'rigged'
against it British Coal could not be blamed because, even with the new
subsidy offered by the government, it had so far failed to secure additional
orders from the electricity generators.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Waldegrave defends service choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTING FOR those who run public services is not necessarily the way to make
the services properly accountable and responsive, Mr William Waldegrave, the
public service minister, argued yesterday.
In a lecture to the Public Finance Foundation Mr Waldegrave insisted that
the key points in the delivery of responsive services were providing choice,
information and redress.
His speech is a direct attack on the criticism of government reforms by some
academics, who say changes reduced the role of elected representatives, such
as councillors, to make way for government appointees.
They have argued that this has created a 'new magistracy' made up of people
appointed to unaccountable organisations such as quangos and trusts.
Mr Waldegrave did not deny the shift away from giving responsibilities to
those who had been elected, but said that the constitutional changes
proposed by those who wanted to inject more democracy were irrelevant to the
delivery of public services.
'There is no guarantee - indeed there may not even be a sporting chance -
that by periodically expressing his or her democratic decision at the ballot
box, the citizen will necessarily obtain efficient, properly accountable,
responsive public services,' he said.
He went beyond rejecting the idea that reforms in areas such as education
and health had created a 'democratic deficit', saying that the government
had strengthened accountability, by providing clearer structures and better
information.
The arrangements for the national curriculum enabled parents to be better
aware of how responsibilities were divided between central government and
individual schools. In the national health service the changes had brought
out the role of the management in individual hospitals, providing a better
focus for public reaction.

MR KEITH VAZ, Labour MP for Leicester East, was accused by the Bank of
England last night of 'being intent upon making mischief' after he led
depositors in the collapsed bank Bank of Credit and Commerce International
delivering a wreath to mark the second anniversary of its closure.
Mr Vaz said he was punched three times by a security man, but said later he

A Bank spokesman denied the claim, saying it was not supported by an

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Opt-out schools inspection pledge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTED-OUT schools will not have to face inspections from hostile school
inspectors, Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said yesterday.
Most contracts to inspect schools, which have been opened to tender for the
next academic year onwards, have been won by local education authority
inspection teams.
Opening a conference organised by the Centre for Policy Studies, Baroness
Blatch said: 'I do have to say that there's a concern where local
authorities have been so thoroughly hostile, for example to grant-maintained
schools, and where they may win the bid to be registered inspectors.'

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten in shift over CTCs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT funding will be made available to schools which specialise in
technology and can find sponsors from local businesses, Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, announced yesterday.
The move marks a shift from City Technology Colleges, which had previously
been at the centre of the government's attempts to encourage technology
teaching. Only 14 CTCs have been built, with another opening in September.
Mr Patten proposes that schools with local businesses represented on their
governing bodies should be backed with additional support from the
government.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: DSS promise on mothers' benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOCIAL security department yesterday distanced itself from remarks by Mr
John Redwood, Welsh secretary, apparently suggesting that state benefit for
lone mothers should be withheld until the father is pursued.
The department said Mr Redwood's comments were 'not government policy' while
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said in the Commons that there
was no question of penalising particular groups of benefit claimants.
Ministers appeared happy, however, for a full debate in the Conservative
party on the treatment of single parents. Mr Lilley told MPs that a
government decision on equalisation of male and female pension ages was
unlikely before the judgment in the Coloroll case, expected in September or
October.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessmen, attended six functions at Downing
Street during the 1980s, the prime minister disclosed last night, Philip
Stephens writes.
But in a series of parliamentary answers, Mr Major said that Mr Nadir had
not been invited to No 10 since Baroness Thatcher was replaced in November
1990.
Mr Major said that when he took office he halted the practice which had
allowed the Conservative party to host fundraising events in Downing Street.
He said that before that date a variety of political functions had taken
place at which the costs had been met by political parties.
Mr Nadir's visits to No 10 took place between 1984 and 1989, before the
collapse of his Polly Peck International business empire.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Ministers may act against big water bill rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS may tell water companies to slow expensive improvements in order
to avoid sharp increases in water bills.
The proposal is likely to be part of the government's response to a report
by Ofwat, the water regulator, to be published next Tuesday. Industry
executives believe that the cost of industry improvements could be less than
the Pounds 43bn estimated by Ofwat in a similar report last year.
Mr David Luffrum, finance director of Thames Water, said yesterday: 'If
within the law it is possible to spread out the spending then we and our
customers would prefer that.' However, delaying some spending could bring
the UK into conflict with Brussels and could prove politically contentious
at home.
Improvements to drinking and bathing water quality have been among the most
popular European environmental rules, but the Ofwat report will fuel the
growing debate in the UK about whether the cost is too high.
One of the most controversial decisions facing ministers is whether to back
measures to remove the remaining traces of lead in drinking water, even
though this could cost Pounds 8bn.
Water companies have projected that bills will need to rise by about 6 per
cent above inflation between 1995 and 2000 to meet environmental rules. Next
spring, in the first wide-ranging review of the industry's pricing structure
since the 1989 privatisation, Ofwat will set price rises for 1995 to 2005.
Yesterday Mr Jim Gardner, chairman of Ofwat's national customer council,
called on the government to halt the increases in bills. He said that the
results of recent customer surveys 'give a strong message to the companies
and to government that customers are not prepared to pay even higher bills
for slightly better services'.
The estimate of Pounds 43bn in Ofwat's report, The Cost of Quality, did not
include the elimination of lead in drinking water, nor the statutory
water-quality objectives to be devised soon by the National Rivers
Authority. This year's report is based on more detailed projections by the
companies and on their customer surveys.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union leaders search for progress
on party links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of the two largest unions affiliated to the Labour party, the
TGWU and GMB general unions, yesterday both suggested ways to head off the
looming clash between the unions and the party leadership over union
representation in the party.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, pressed the idea of postponing the
decision on how to select parliamentary candidates until next year's
conference as the Boundaries Commission findings makes a decision at this
year's conference unnecessary. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who wants
the unions excluded from local selections, has made clear, however, that he
does not favour postponement.
Meanwhile Mr Bill Morris, TGWU leader, speaking at the union's conference in
Bournemouth, said: 'If I was asked to advise Mr Smith I would just say 'talk
to us'. We have to have movement over the summer because the conference is
rapidly approaching'.
He floated the suggestion of a code of practice on how unions consult their
members paying the political levy over parliamentary selections and the
election of the leader.
He suggested that the code need not require ballots but could include
mem-bers voting at branches.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, who was attending the TGWU
conference, expressed interest in the idea of deferring a decision and in a
union code of practice. 'The important thing is we have to get an agreed
solution - there is good will on all sides,' she said.

<TEXT>
A LARGE majority of respondents to the government debate on the future of
the BBC want the corporation to continue broadcasting a wide range of
programmes and to be funded by licence fee.
The large measure of support for the survival of something similar to the
existing BBC structure, with the same number of radio and television
channels, came in replies to a government consultation exercise.
An analysis of the 6,210 letters on the subject received from the public by
independent consultants Research International Media and Advertising was
published yesterday by Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary.
The consultants say they do not believe the results are misleading because
they conform to an established finding from other studies 'that the BBC is
widely held to be a special case, it is not just another broadcaster.'
Sixty one per cent wanted the BBC to continue broadcasting a wide range of
programmes compared with only 9 per cent who did not.
Sixty six per cent of the letters supported the licence fee compared with
only 7 per cent opting for advertising.
Nearly 30 per cent, however, said they wanted the BBC to become more
efficient and manage its money better.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt holds firm over pits policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Hunt, employment secretary, last night emphasised the difficulties
in expanding sales of deep-mined coal for electricity generation as hopes of
a reprieve for the pits facing early closure continued to fade.
In a boisterous Commons debate he faced a barrage of interruptions from
Labour critics, and anxious questions from some Tory backbenchers, as he
insisted that the government had not given any guarantee that 12 pits could
be saved.
Mr Hunt also angered Labour MPs by contending that privatisation would help
to ensure a continuing role for Britain's coal industry.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, maintained that in
spite of the cautious words used by ministers in public the press had been
'heavily briefed' that 12 pits would be saved.
He said two of the pits were already doomed as a result of ballots in which
the miners were offered an extra Pounds 10,000 on top of their redundancy
payments if they voted for closure, and the other 10 were still at risk.
Mr Cook argued that with the market 'rigged' against it British Coal could
not be blamed because, even with the new subsidy offered by the government,
it had so far failed to secure additional orders from the electricity
generators.
Even though coal was being offered at 40 per cent below the base contract
price the electricity generators were not prepared to place additional
orders because they had retained large stocks and preferred to enter into
'sweetheart deals' for new gas-fired power stations.
Mr Cook said the nuclear subsidy provided by the government was being used
by the electricity generators to import electricity from France at a higher
price than coal available from the British pits which are facing closure
through lack of orders.
He protested that the government had offered the generators a subsidy
without implementing a recommendation by the Commons trade and industry
committee requiring them to enter into contracts for an additional 21m tons
of coal.
Mr Richard Caborn (Lab Sheffield Central), chairman of the committee, warned
that without a package of measures similar to that it had recommended, the
remainder of the 12 pits would close at the rate of one a month.
Mr Hunt said the industry had to come to terms with a substantial change in
the energy market, and while it had a future it could not rely on an
'open-ended' subsidy designed to keep alive uneconomic pits.
He said the generators held stocks of 30m tons, and this obviously had an
effect on the market.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Agreement on EC aid welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWNING Street yesterday welcomed an outline European Community agreement on
aid worth Pounds 2.3bn for depressed UK areas - but refused to say how
Britain would interpret the rules on matching EC funds with aid from local
or national government.
Past Treasury attempts to curb its spending on regions benefiting from EC
assistance have resulted in clashes with Brussels and rows between Whitehall
departments and in Westminster.
Downing Street said details of the agreement on 'structural funds' reached
by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, at a long meeting over the weekend
had still to be worked out - not least because of a dispute on the separate
issue of 'cohesion' funds for the Irish Republic.
Officials said it would be 'extremely cynical' to assume that much of the
extra money would be clawed back by the Treasury.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Australian broadcaster backs 'Producer Choice'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC director-general Mr John Birt has been advised by the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation to persevere with its controversial Producer Choice
policy.
Mr David Hill, managing director of the ABC, told Mr Birt in a meeting in
London last week that a similar scheme introduced four years ago at his
broadcasting organisation had been 'a dramatic and remarkable success'.
Producer Choice, launched at the BBC in April, provides for the full costing
of all programmes for the first time and gives producers the right to buy in
services from the outside market.
The Australian version - largely modelled on the BBC - is called User Pays
and, like Producer Choice, involves total programme costing.
In the past both ABC and BBC producer budgets have accounted for a small
proportion of total costs and resources - such as studios and editing time -
and were simply givens.
Mr Hill said that since the start of User Pays four years ago there had been
a 20 per cent increase in productivity at the ABC. The number of staff had
also fallen from 6,500 to 5,500.
In 1989-90, Mr Hill pointed out, the total number of resource hours used to
produce ABC programmes was 2.3m. In 1992-3 the total was 1.8m, yet in the
same time the number of hours transmitted increased by 6 per cent.
Since 1989-90 the average cost per hour of ABC television has come down from
ADollars 32,424 to Dollars 29,550.
'In Australia User Pays was portrayed as the end of civilisation,' said Mr
Hill. In fact, he emphasised, the money saved was ploughed into more
Australian-made programmes which helped the public service to fight back
against its commercial rivals.
Mr Hill pointed out, however, that the Australian scheme was phased in more
gradually and producers had to get permission before buying in services from
outside.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Morris certain to take over head of
new union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL MORRIS is almost certain to take over as temporary head of the giant
general union to be formed within the next three to four years when his own
union the TGWU general union merges with the GMB general union.
Senior officials of both unions believe that Mr Morris, who is 53, will take
over as leader for about one year before handing over to GMB leader Mr John
Edmonds.
The TGWU's biennial conference yesterday gave full backing to the principle
of merger as did the GMB conference in May although with a more vocal
dissenting minority.
The biggest problem areas in the merger negotiations will be fusing the lay
member-dominated culture of the TGWU with the more central role played by
full-time officials in the GMB. Some of the GMB regions are also highly
independent.
In recent times the TGWU has been on the left of Labour party politics and
the GMB on the right. But the picture has become much more blurred with Mr
Morris pushing his own union towards the centre and Mr Edmonds, especially
in his recent defence of the Labour-union links, making overtures to the
left.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Drive to reduce building litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVIEW to reduce contract abuses and litigation in the construction
industry was launched yesterday by Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister.
Mr Baldry, a barrister, said more time was spent on litigation over building
defects than correcting them.
The inquiry, expected to cost Pounds 250,000, is to be financed jointly by
the government and construction employers' organisations. It will examine
ways to improve contractual and purchasing arrangements in the industry. It
will be led by Sir Michael Latham, a former Conservative MP who was director
of the Housebuilders Federation from 1971 to 1973.
Members of the inquiry team will include representatives of property
developers, main contractors and specialist sub-contractors.
Sir Michael said the review would take 12 months, with an interim report
planned for the end of this year.
The inquiry, proposed last summer by construction employers' organisations,
follows a series of complaints about builders from customers and from within
the industry.
Customers have complained about contractors trying to boost earnings by
claiming sometimes large additional payments for changes in the design or
specification of a building once construction has started.
The review is also expected to look at late payment of bills to contractors
and sub-contractors.
Mr Baldry said the review would examine ways to overhaul procedures to
reduce conflict and litigation and encourage productivity and
competitiveness.
He said lawyers recognised that construction provided the bulk of civil
actions in the courts and that this was a big drain on the industry and its
customers.

FT  06 JUL 93 / 'Wise men' say recovery will be slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN FACES a 'slow and patchy' recovery with demand held back by the
prospects of increased taxation, says to the Treasury's panel of outside
economic advisers.
In the panel's first report to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the seven
economists say subdued growth of money and credit is a 'cause for concern'.
Weakness in key export markets in the rest of Europe may also hold back an
upturn, says the report.
More positively, the panel is relaxed about the prospects for inflation and
thinks Britain has a good chance of relatively strong growth without
unacceptable price pressures over the next few years.
Four out of seven on the group say public spending cuts or tax rises, beyond
the tax increases already announced for next April, are needed to curb the
rising budget deficit.
A majority also says credibility of monetary policy would improve if the
government switched responsibility for setting interest rates from the
Treasury to the Bank of England, assuming a consensus exists 'on the need
for low inflation'.
The panel was set up in January as part of a Treasury effort to widen the
economic debate.
It says 'prospects for recovery remain fragile', partly as a result of high
consumer debts and weak house sales. The risk of increased inflation may
make it necessary to reduce demand by raising interest rates.
On a more bullish note, the full effects of the 4 percentage point cut in
interest rates since sterling's devaluation last September 'have yet to be
felt'. Economic reforms during the 1980s may have increased labour-market
flexibility, increasing productivity and the potential for output gains.
The panel says any steps to cut public spending should protect investment.
'Within public spending the balance should be shifted towards those elements
which support competitiveness - including education, research and
development, training and transport infrastructure,' it says.
Prof Tim Congdon, Prof David Currie, Mr Gavyn Davies and Mr Andrew Sentance
want a fiscal tightening adding up to about 1 1/2 per cent of gross domestic
product to 'provide greater certainty that the debt position will become
sustainable'. The measures could to be phased in over several years.
The panel is less pessimistic than the Treasury about the likely gap between
government spending and income this financial year. While the Treasury
thinks this will be about Pounds 50bn, the average forecast from the
advisers is Pounds 45.5bn.
The group thinks GDP will grow 1.6 per cent this year, followed by 2.6 per
cent in 1994. It reckons the year-on-year change in the retail prices index
excluding mortgage payments - the government's chosen measure for underlying
inflation - will be 3.3 per cent at the end of next year, comfortably inside
the Treasury's 4 per cent target.
The group is gloomy about unemployment, thinking this will come down only to
2.5m by 1996, from just under 3m.
The majority view expressed in the Treasury report is 'wrong headed',
Professor Patrick Minford, one of the study's authors, said yesterday.
Prof Minford of Liverpool University, a leading monetarist, is the only one
of the seven advisers arguing for an immediate reduction in interest rates
from 6 per cent to 5 per cent. He also wants a further 1 percentage point
reduction by the end of the year.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Consumer borrowing remains buoyant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER borrowing remained buoyant last month, pointing to a gradual
recovery in confidence and reflecting the rise in retail sales.
Official credit business figures showed that consumers borrowed a net Pounds
118m in May. This was below the levels of the two previous months which - at
more than Pounds 190m in both March and April - were the highest for nearly
two years.
In spite of the slowdown, May was the eighth consecutive month that
consumers borrowed more than they paid back. The increase in borrowing was
generated by finance houses, which lent a net Pounds 180m to consumers in
May. This was offset by net repayments of Pounds 56m on credit card loans,
and Pounds 6m on unsecured building society loans.
New credit advanced to consumers fell in May to Pounds 4.2bn, down from
Pounds 4.4bn in April. The Central Statistical Office said this mainly
reflected lower advances on credit cards.
Although the figures account for only about 15 per cent of private-sector
debt - mortgages are not included - they provide a useful snapshot of the
state of consumer activity.
The CSO said net lending had been rising since about August last year. This
suggests that consumers are not as cautious about accumulating debt as they
were in the recession, but monthly figures have yet to reach levels that
were common at the end of the 1980s.
In the three months to the end of May net lending to consumers rose to
Pounds 508m from Pounds 341m in the previous three month period.
Confidence about UK exports has slipped slightly in the latest quarter
according to a survey of directors carried out by Gallup for DHL, the
freight company.
The survey showed that exporters are less optimistic than three months ago
but 47 per cent have high expectations for orders in the next three months.
Orders will be good or excellent in the coming year, 62 per cent believe.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Housing market revival 'starting to falter'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONGEST warning yet to government that the housing market revival has
started to falter was made yesterday by the country's largest building
employers' organisation.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, appealed
for an immediate cut in interest rates to boost consumer confidence.
He said building output was still falling after four years of decline,
leaving the construction industry deeply entrenched in recession.
Any attempt by the government to cut public borrowing at the expense of
construction investment programmes would further damage an industry which
had already lost 500,000 jobs since summer 1989.
A confederation survey of 600 building companies showed that a quarter of
those questioned expected to make further redundancies in the next three
months.
Sir Brian said: 'Any optimism felt earlier in the year and after the Autumn
Statement measures to help industry has not been sustained.
'Our markets are suffering from a lack of consumer confidence caused by
political and economic uncertainties, speculation about possible tax
increases and a continuing fear of unemployment.'
This was having a 'particularly severe impact on the private housing market
which, having shown an improvement in prospects in the spring, has now
faltered with reservations and house sales falling since the beginning of
May'.
The confederation's survey showed that 95 per cent of construction companies
were still working at less than three quarters of capacity.
Enquiries for work from potential customers had deteriorated in April, May
and June after showing signs of improvement in the previous six months.
Some companies, desperate for cash from progress payments, were winning jobs
at prices which would not cover the eventual cost of doing the work.
Building material price increases were also causing concern.
Sir Brian, who warned that more company failures and job losses were likely
to follow, said: 'From these results I can see no prospect of any sustained
recovery within the next 12 months. It is therefore essential that the
government takes further action to stimulate our industry.'
A decision by ministers to give the go-ahead for the Jubilee Line
Underground extension in London would give an important boost to the
industry.
Sir Brian appealed to the government to extend capital allowances for
industrial building beyond the end of next year. He also wanted greater
action from Treasury to promote private investment in public works such as
hospitals and prisons as well as road and rail schemes.
His comments came as the Department of the Environment published figures
showing a sharp rise in the number of homes started. These rose 19 per cent
during the three months to the end of May compared with the previous three
months.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Output at Jaguar jumps by 46%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR OUTPUT by Jaguar, Ford's luxury cars subsidiary, jumped by 46 per cent
in the first half of this year - compared with the corresponding period last
year - as recovery continued in some of its main world markets.
However the increase, to 14,970 cars from 10,227 cars, reflects the fact
that last year the company had extensive lay-offs and short-time working as
the recession hit Jaguar's Birmingham plants.
So far this year output for the US market, the single most important to
Jaguar, has risen 20 per cent, with UK output up 10 per cent.
A sales push in Germany, following the launch there of the new V12 saloon,
doubled Jaguar's market share in that country in the first five months of
this year.
But the collapse in Germany's luxury car market - sales of all makes in the
first five months were down by 46 per cent - meant Jaguar's sales volume in
Germany rose only about 20 per cent.
Jaguar said yesterday it believed it was on target to reach 29,000 sales
this year.

FT  06 JUL 93 / M0 picks up after declining in April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMOUNT of money in circulation increased last month, pointing towards
continued economic revival.
Bank of England figures showed yesterday that M0, the narrow measure of the
money supply - mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose a
seasonally-adjusted 0.3 per cent compared with May after a fall of 1.1 per
cent in April.
This lifted the year-on-year growth rate to 4.4 per cent, an improvement on
May's exceptionally low figure of 3.3 per cent.
Analysts said the rebound in M0, which pushed the annual growth rate back
above the ceiling of the government's zero to 4 per cent monitoring range,
would allay fears that retail activity had dipped. The Bank said the fall in
May could have been linked to the two bank holidays in that month which
traditionally alter spending patterns.
Mr Robert Lind, economist at brokers UBS, said: 'The above-range growth in
M0 could presage a further recovery in retail sales in coming months. It
should also dampen speculation of an imminent cut in base rates.'
The Bank's figures also suggested that broad money growth - M0 plus bank
deposits - is on an upward trend from a low point of 3.1 per cent at the
start of the year. Seasonally-adjusted M4 rose by 0.5 per cent in May. The
year-on-year rate of increase was a seasonally-adjusted 3.8 per cent
compared with 3.5 per cent in April.
Strong M0 growth has been apparent since the start of the year. The
12-monthly growth rate recently peaked at 4.9 per cent in March, reflecting
the recovery in retail sales. Although there is no exact monthly
relationship between M0 and high street sales, the two follow similar paths.
In the latest six months on a year-on-year basis, M0 grew by 3.8 per cent.
The Bank revised slightly the figure for sterling lending to individuals and
companies by banks and building societies. In May this rose by Pounds 2bn
compared with a provisional Pounds 1.9bn.

FT  06 JUL 93 / London forecast to attract foreign companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES TO advance corporation tax that were proposed in the March Budget
will make the UK a more attractive location for foreign-owned multinational
groups to locate their European headquarters. That is the conclusion of a
report by the City Research Project, a three-year study into London's
competitive position in international financial services.
Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman of the project, said that before the
Budget a number of foreign-owned financial services companies based in the
UK had been considering relocating to other European countries.
US banks in London, for instance, are disadvantaged under the present ACT
regime if they remit profits from European operations through a London
headquarters to their US parents in the form of dividends. They cannot
reclaim or offset ACT payable on dividends.
Mr Chris Higson of the London Business School, one of the authors of the
report, said that under current ACT rules companies located in London
suffered a 7 per cent tax disadvantage compared with those located in the
Netherlands, the country regarded as the most tax-advantageous in Europe.
He said under the proposed rules companies which chose to locate in the UK
would have a 3 per cent advantage over those in the Netherlands.
The Budget proposed a system of 'foreign income dividends' under which
dividends paid out of non-UK income would not be liable to UK ACT.
Mr Higson said the benefits of the proposed changes were much smaller for
multinational companies with UK parents than for those with overseas
parents.
Commenting on the City's new security cordon, Mr Yassukovich said there was
no anecdotal evidence to suggest that security issues were much of a
determinant in companies' decisions to locate in London. He said all
countries faced some security problems.

FT  06 JUL 93 / 'Ring of steel' relies on plastic bollards: Jimmy Burns
finds few obstacles as he ventures into the cordoned-off City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE BOOT of my car I carried a personal computer and a document bag, the
kind of luggage that when packed with Semtex explosive can shatter
buildings.
The police advice yesterday was to leave the car at home as London's
so-called ring of steel came into force. But out of necessity this City
worker had to take the risk.
In Belfast, a driver stopped at a checkpoint is automatically required to
produce some form of identification. An armed policeman or soldier conducts
the inquiry, while a back-up team of armed security personnel look on.
There, it is normal practice for the police or military to examine the
passenger seat and the boot, if the vehicle has been stopped in or near an
area identified as at high risk of terrorist attack.
London's version of street security proved slightly different. Starting off
from Wandsworth in south London at 8.30am, I took a route across the Thames
at Westminster and along the embankment into the Square Mile through one of
the permitted entry points in Cannon Street.
At the junction of Change Street and Cannon Street at 8.50am two policemen
stood by one of several entry points, a line of plastic bollards, waving
traffic on. Parked in one of the nearby sidestreets, closed now to through
traffic, a police squad car looked on discreetly. The traffic flowed
smoothlyon until it reached London Bridge.
Again no armed guards, just a couple of policemen flanked by photographers
and cameramen and a small group of protesters from an anti-militarist
movement. A very unmilitary looking City bobby somewhat self-consciously
checked a large van transporting stationery. His colleague questioned the
driver of a smaller van which was found to be empty. The checks caused the
kind of brief traffic snarl-up the City experiences on any working day and
which in Belfast has long been a fact of life.
Across the bridge thousands of commuters were marching unchallenged to work,
carrying briefcases and bags. The policemen had their eyes focused
exclusively on the vehicles.
It was now 9.10am. I had allowed the extra 30 minutes recommended by the
police and motoring organisations to get to work in time. With no real
congestion to speak of, I had arrived thirty minutes early, and with enough
time to put the effectiveness of the ring of steel further to the test.
The warning from the police was that nobody should attempt to drive around
or through the temporary barriers. Any irregular driving could set off a
security alert.
I drove back across London Bridge, past the same police squad car, and the
same police checkpoints.
I drove up to a road barrier (unmanned), tried to get round it, then backed
away. I turned off Cannon Street, negotiating the back streets which lie
behind the Lloyd's building. Here there were no policemen to be seen and
someone had parked unchallenged.
Just by Leadenhall Street, I stopped my own car, surveying the local
buildings, taking notes again. Nobody seemed remotely interested. I was
within a few city blocks of the site of the last big IRA bomb.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Confidence eludes farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS still have some way to go before confidence returns to the
hard-pressed UK agricultural sector, the National Farmer's Union said
yesterday. It said the lack of confidence persisted in spite of a limited
upturn in the past year.
A union official said: 'In some quarters there is more confidence than
before, but we would still be cautious about it.' He pointed out that last
year's devaluation of the green pound, the EC farming currency, had given
British farmers a badly-needed breathing space. But few would use it as a
basis for long-term investment decisions, he added.
Farmers have delayed investing in new equipment and land in recent years
because they have faced low incomes and high interest charges.
The Royal Agricultural Society of England has published a survey showing
that some farmers are more willing to invest in land and machinery than they
were a year ago. The survey, in which 474 farmers were approached in the
spring, found that two thirds have either bought a new tractor in the past
quarter or intend to do so.
Tractor sales were up 17 per cent in the first half of the year after sales
reached a record low last year, according to the Agricultural Equipment
Association.
Farmers at the Royal Show, which opened yesterday at Stoneleigh,
Warwickshire, say that government and EC red tape are among their biggest
problems this year.
Farmers have recently completed the latest EC forms entitling them to
payments for not cultivating some of their land. The Royal Agricultural
Society survey found that on average these forms took a week to complete at
a cost of Pounds 400.
The society also found the dairy sector the most buoyant - reforms of the
Milk Marketing Board should lead to higher milk prices for farmers next year
 -with potato growers the most pessimistic.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Ernst &amp; Young cleared by regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the accountancy firm, has been cleared of any deficiencies in
its current procedures and audit controls by the profession's regulators.
The Audit Registration Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales concluded yesterday that it would propose no regulatory
action as a result of its investigation.
It emerged yesterday that at least three other public interest inquiries
into large accountancy firms are under way. One is believed to be at Price
Waterhouse, on which an announcement is imminent.
Yesterday's announcement signalled the conclusion of the Ernst &amp; Young
investigation, which was the first public interest inquiry to be conducted
by the commit-tee.
It followed criticism of the firm's audits and those of Arthur Young, with
which it has since merged, in several inquiries by Department of Trade and
Industry inspectors. These included audits of Sound Diffusion, Milbury,
Rotaprint and Edencorp Leisure.
The inquiries examine the adequacy of procedures and their documentation by
firms. But Mr Bruce Picking, director of practice regulation at the
institute, said it was far more difficult for its committee to review
professional judgment made during audits.

<TEXT>
LORD SPENS, whose trial on charges relating to Guinness's share-support
operation in the 1986 takeover of Distillers was abandoned, was yesterday
awarded legal costs that could total more than Pounds 250,000.
The former merchant banker's trial for conspiracy and false accounting was
abandoned early last year after five months when his fellow defendant, Mr
Roger Seelig, was judged too ill to continue. Lord Spens was finally cleared
last November.
Lord Spens has attacked the regulatory authorities from his seat in the
House of Lords and is suing the Bank of England for allegedly pressuring his
former employers, the merchant bankers Henry Ansbacher, to dismiss him as
their corporate finance managing director in 1986.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Tory MPs warn against further cuts: Reductions cause alarm
in Commmons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers yesterday issued stern warnings to the government against
further defence cuts, as they emphasised how far the armed forces were
already stretched in meeting existing commitments.
In a series of interventions that seemed directed at least as much towards
the Treasury as towards Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, senior
Conservative MPs lined up to stress that they would not support reductions
beyond those in the current expenditure plans.
Tory reaction in response to Mr Rifkind's Commons statement on the defence
white paper was led by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the Commons
defence committee. He argued that because there could be no cuts in the
commitments undertaken by the armed forces, 'it must follow that no further
cuts in resource can be made by the Treasury to the funds which are made
available to the Ministry of Defence'.
Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, a leading member of the Conservative backbench
defence committee, said many Tory MPs recognised that UK forces were 'fully
stretched'. They did not want Mr Rifkind to have to announce further cuts
next year as a result of the annual public spending discussions.
Mr David Clark, the shadow defence secretary, renewed Labour demands for a
full-scale defence review. He said defence-spending reductions must be
planned and managed on the basis of security and defence, not merely
Treasury demands. He added: 'In reality there is increasing demands on our
armed forces but with fewer tanks, fewer ships and fewer men and women . . .
Nothing has changed. Overstretch will go on.'
The starkest warning came from Mr Winston Churchill, a Tory member of the
Commons defence committee, who was among those expressing deep concern at
the cut in the number of destroyers and frigates. 'We will no longer be able
to fulfil our capabilities that we have in the past in the event that we
ever have to fight a significant conventional war in the future,' he told
MPs.
Mr Rifkind disagreed, and insisted that changes were justified since the end
of the cold war and the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Old threats
would not re-emerge overnight, and if they seemed to be reappearing, the
government would have a duty to revise defence capabilities.
Following calls by former defence minister Mr Archie Hamilton for a review
of the military presence in Northern Ireland, Mr Rifkind reassured Ulster
MPs. He pledged that military numbers there would be reduced only if it were
justifiable on security grounds.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Industry gives cautious welcome: Nuclear plans unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE CONTRACTORS cautiously welcomed the details of cuts and procurement
plans in yesterday's white paper.
Few contracts were cancelled, and the reduction in the numbers of
conventionally powered submarines and Tornado fighter aircraft should be
achieved through the decommissioning or sale of existing equipment.
Mr Brian Lowe, chairman of the Defence Manufacturers' Association, said:
'The industry could be reasonably relieved that most of the cuts are lost
opportunities to refurbish rather than cancelled orders.'
Among those hearing bad news were GEC and British Aerospace, which were
competing for one of the two cancelled missile contracts, the Pounds
500m-plus medium range surface to air missile to replace the Bloodhound
missile.
But both companies shrugged off the news. 'We've known for some time this
was likely to happen,' said BAe, which was bidding with Raytheon of the US.
GEC, which had joined forces with Thomson and Aerospatiale of France and
Italy's Alenia, would have contributed only about 10 per cent of the
contract on an industrial level with its radar-seeking equipment, but it has
lost its chance to become a prime contractor to the UK in the project.
GEC and BAe said the cancellations were unlikely to lead to job cuts. They
are working in international consortia which are selling their missiles to
several markets other than the UK.
Thorn EMI may lose 200 jobs as a result of the MoD's withdrawal from a
four-nation collaborative programme to develop a ground-launched Multiple
Launch Rocket System.
The company is hanging on to the slim hope that it may be involved in the
supply of an air-launched version.
At the other end of the scale, Southampton shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft
could receive orders for new mine-hunting ships worth up to Pounds 350m as a
result of plans in the white paper to 'build up a fleet of 25 mine
countermeasure vessels'.
Mr Martin Jay, managing director of Vosper, said: 'We're delighted that the
white paper seems to recognise the importance of minehunters in general and
Sandown class in particular.'
Helicopter-maker Westland said that it was 'good news' that the white paper
specified a need for additional support helicopters. The company's EH101
helicopter is a strong candidate for the business.
Staff at Swan Hunter said the yard would try to bid for the refurbishment of
the Sir Bedivere, announced in the white paper, although previously such
contracts have gone to state-owned military yards. The contract would be
worth about Pounds 30m to the Tyneside yard, which is fighting for survival
after losing a contract to build a helicopter carrier to VSEL of
Barrow-in-Furness.
A decision on the production of a further 200 Challenger 2 main battle tanks
by Vickers remained unresolved. The white paper said the MoD is still
considering how best to equip the Army's tank regiments.

FT  06 JUL 93 / MoD wants reliability and flexibility on a tight budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIABILITY, flexibility and maintenance are the themes of the defence white
paper as the Ministry of Defence stretches resources to meet commitments.
They are part of what Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, writes in his
introduction is 'a new and fundamental analysis of the way in which defence
assets are, and will need to be, employed'.
The starting point for this analysis is the three roles to be played by the
UK's defence forces:
Protection of territory. This ranges from patrolling territorial waters and
the streets of Northern Ireland to maintaining a nuclear capability.
Membership of Nato. This is to ensure against external threats to the UK and
its allies.
Promotion of wider interests. These include support for Nato, the Western
European Union and United Nations operations in the former Yugoslavia.
Each of these roles is then allocated personnel, equipment and budgets for
the next three years on the premise that 'the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet
Union now belong to history'.
The paper says the result is a number of adjustments, both enhancement and
reductions to force levels.
'The Navy's tasks can therefore be met by a force of 12 active submarines
rather than the 16 previously planned. We have therefore decided to withdraw
the Upholder Class of conventional submarine from service by 1995.'
It adds: 'Project definition studies continue for the replacement of the
assault ships Fearless and Intrepid, and we plan to invite tenders for the
refurbishment programme for the landing ship logistic Sir Bedivere shortly.'
Nuclear plans are practically unchanged 'to take account of the large
nuclear arsenal Russia will retain even after the implementation of Start
(Strategic Arms Reductions Talks) agreements'.
Each Trident submarine will initially carry no more than 128 Warheads,' the
paper says, although it says the figure may be reduced later.
The service life of the WE177 free-fall bomb is being extended 'well into
the next century' and a decision on its replacement postponed.
There is a reduction in equipment levels in the Royal Air Force. 'With
effect from 1 April 1994, a force of 100 Tornado F3 fighters will be fully
capable of defending the United Kingdom's airspace and meeting our
commitment to NATO's reaction forces - a reduction of 13 aircraft.'
These will be reorganised into six squadrons rather than the present seven.
The disappearance of the Warsaw Pact threat reduces the likelihood of bomber
attack. Therefore 'there is no near-term requirement for a medium-range
surface to air missile (MSAM).' The missile ws a Pounds 500m-plus contract
for which British companies had tendered.
But RAF transport aircraft and support helicopters receive promises of
orders. 'Substantial further investment in these areas is planned. This
includes the rolling replacement or refurbishment of about half the RAF's
Hercules fleet. There is a need to procure additional support helicopters.'
The Pounds 32bn Eurofighter 2000 project is regarded as 'keystone' of the
RAF's future capability, although the future of the Tornado GR1 is less
clear as the government continues to 'consider options for upgrading the
Tornado GR1 aircraft with a mid-life update which will enhance their
operational capability and allow their continued operation well into the
next century'.
Opponents of the abolition of some Army regiments received some good news.
'The previously announced amalgamations of the Royal Scots and the King's
Own Scottish Borderers, and of the Cheshire Regiment and the Staffordshire
Regiment, will not proceed.' The reversal of the decisions to amalgamate
these two regiments was made possible by 'reorganisation and efficiency
measures (to) release a further 2,000 personnel'.
But there are cuts in Army equipment. 'An indirect fire anti-armour missile
should be provided through the procurement of an air-launched weapon for the
RAF. This means that the United Kingdom will withdraw from the collaborative
programme to develop a ground-launched version of such a weapon (MLRS III).'
The effect of these changes will be 'more mobile, flexible armed forces. A
central feature of all new programmes is increased emphasis on reliability
and maintainability'.
The paper adds that the cut in defence spending to 3.2 per cent of gross
domestic product by 1995-96 leaves spending above the Nato average.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Defence spending declines to 50-year low: RAF to lose
another Tornado squadron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN IF the Ministry of Defence manages to defend itself against further
Treasury pressure - which is by no means certain - defence spending is set
to drop from 3.9 per cent of Britain's gross domestic product to 3.2 per
cent in two years, the lowest level for some 50 years.
This year's defence white paper contains a series of cuts further to the
Options for Change plan of three years ago, which reduced the armed forces
by more than 20 per cent.
It contrasts sharply with previous years, when the annual Statement on the
Defence Estimates has been little more than a recapitulation of policy.
Following public expenditure curbs in November, the Ministry of Defence lost
Pounds 1.05bn from its spending plans for this year and 1994-95.
After the strong emphasis on defence at the height of the Thatcher years,
the government has tried to portray the changes as a logical response to a
changed world, and to fend off the impression of being forced by Treasury
pressure to cut back. But it has never been completely convincing.
Two guided-weapon projects have been abandoned:
An air defence system to replace the Bloodhound missile, withdrawn because
of old age in 1991. British Aerospace was bidding for the Pounds 500m-plus
contract jointly with Raytheon, makers of the Patriot missile. GEC and
Siemens Plessey were also bidding in separate partnerships with foreign
companies. The MoD says there is 'no near-term requirement', leaving open
the possibility of a more advanced anti-missile system later.
Guided anti-tank munitions for multiple rocket launchers. After spending
Pounds 100m, Britain has joined Germany and the US in withdrawing from this
project, leaving only France.
Other cuts are made in existing equipment on the grounds of a reduced direct
threat to the UK and to Atlantic shipping routes:
The frigate and destroyer fleet. In the 1980s the number of craft was firmly
set at 'about 50'. It is now 39 and due to be reduced to 'about 35'. But
more of the latest Type 23 frigates will still be built.
Diesel-electric submarines. Four new Upholder class vessels, built at a cost
of about Pounds 900m, the last one commissioned just 10 days ago, are to be
sold, leased or mothballed.
Older minesweepers will be taken out of service, leaving a smaller fleet,
although with more new Sandown class minehunters.
The RAF, after losing 14 aircraft squadrons under Options for Change, will
lose a further squadron of Tornado F3 air-defence fighters.
One of the RAF's seven Awacs radar aircraft will be put in reserve.
On the other hand, unspecified extra funds have been set aside to provide
the RAF with its long-promised troop-carrying helicopters, a question the
MoD says it is now 'urgently considering'. Plans for a new helicopter
carrier, once thought to have been axed, were already confirmed in May.
The changes form part of a long line of reviews and adjustments since the
second world war, made necessary by a mismatch between the role Britain has
sought to play in the world and its means for fulfilling it. The white paper
sets out for the first time in detail the tasks allotted to Britain's forces
and the assets - battalions, ships, aircraft - and resources earmarked for
them.
These tasks grouped under three broad headings: protection of the UK and
dependent territories; Nato defence; and wider security interests including
peacekeeping. They range from nuclear deterrence to the reinforcement of
Brunei.
The white paper can be seen as a defence both against arbitrary financial
cuts and against parliamentary critics who argue that cuts have gone too
far.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has been desperate to avoid a repeat
of the recent row over Army strength which he failed to quell in February by
increasing planned numbers by 3,000 to 119,000. Officials say Army
'overstretch' will be eased by 1995 when reorganisation is complete and
troops have been withdrawn from posts such as Belize.
Because forces are often available for more than one job, the white paper
purports to demonstrate that Britain is getting Pounds 43.1bn-worth of
defence for its Pounds 23.6bn annual expenditure. The government sees the
data as providing the basis for 'a coherent and viable debate on defence'.
More cuts, however, are to come. RAF and navy personnel are due to fall
below the 70,000 and 52,500 levels set out in the white paper, already
reduced since Options for Change.
A new air-launched nuclear missile, costing up to Pounds 3bn and under
discussion with France and the US since 1988, is virtually certain to be
cancelled.
A verdict is still awaited on whether the Army will get more Challenger 2
tanks, or updated Challenger 1s, and how many. Also undecided is the extent
of plans for upgrading Tornado bombers. The MoD's suppliers still lack all
the answers they have been waiting for.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Coopers faces scrutiny after disciplinary case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, the accountancy firm, is to be subjected to an
independent review of its internal systems. This follows a breach of ethical
rules in connection with the administration of Polly Peck International, the
group formerly headed by fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir.
The review represents a substantial climbdown over disciplinary action
initially proposed by the accountancy profession against two Coopers
partners, Mr Richard Stone and Mr Michael Jordan.
The practice regulation review committee of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday that it would be testing
Coopers systems to ensure that they were able to detect potential conflicts
of interest early before the acceptance of insolvency appointments.
Mr Stone, head of corporate finance, and Mr Jordan, head of the firm's
insolvency arm, were fined Pounds 1,000 each by the institute's disciplinary
committee last October. The fines were the maximum possible and were imposed
for breaching an ethical standard that insolvency practitioners should not
accept appointments to a company with which their firm has a 'continuing
professional relationship'.
The insolvency licensing committee had made an order on April 15 this year,
subject to appeal, that the two men would be placed under temporary
restrictions on taking new insolvency appointments.
That judgment - which was never made public - was overturned by the
three-person review committee, which said yesterday the order would be
varied so that no restrictions would be imposed on future appointments.
The costs of the systems review will be paid by Mr Jordan and Mr Stone, who
made personal representations to the review committee at its hearing at the
end of last month.
Mr Bruce Picking, head of practice regulation at the institute, said the
committee's only concern was whether procedures now in force worked in the
public interest. He said: 'The issue of the past has already been dealt
with.'
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday that its systems were 'not as robust as we
thought' at the time of the Polly Peck administration in October 1990. The
firm said it had misunderstood the ethical guidance.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Simpler reporting regime suggested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board is considering plans to approve a simpler set
of financial reporting requirements for smaller British companies.
The initiative is designed to ease the burden on companies which would find
the board's new standards costly, and for which the public interest in
compliance is less essential.
It reflects concern from many companies that they will have difficulties in
implementing the ambitious and controversial programme of new standards
launched by the board.
Mr David Tweedie, the board's chairman, wrote this year suggesting the idea
to the Consultative Committee of Accounting Bodies, the body owned by the
leading pro-fessional accountancy bodies.
He said he hoped it would canvass the views of practitioners and smaller
companies, and possibly commission research on the topic.
The idea of a separate set of generally accepted accounting principles for
companies of different sizes has been debated in many countries, but few
have yet adopted such proposals. The Accounting Standards Board allowed
smaller companies to be temporarily exempt from FRS 1, its standard on the
cashflow statement which became mandatory last year.
Smaller companies are already exempt from supplying all but summary
financial information in the returns they are required to make public each
year at Companies House, the government's corporate information agency.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Patten makes switch in technology education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT funding will be made available to schools which specialise in
technology and can find sponsors from local businesses, Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, announced yesterday.
The move marks a shift from City Technology Colleges, which had previously
been at the centre of the government's attempts to encourage technology
teaching. CTCs were intended to be newly built schools, funded by the
private sector.
Employers' organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry,
objected that the government was attempting to raise funds from business
which could have come from the public sector. Only 14 CTCs have been built,
with another opening in September.
The new plan provides more government funding and is cheaper because it
utilises existing schools.
Mr Patten proposes that schools with local businesses represented on their
governing bodies should be backed with additional support from the
government, enabling the best of them to become technology colleges.
He said: 'Technology Colleges will be maintained schools specialising in
teaching technology, mathematics and science while still delivering the full
breadth of the national curriculum. They will adopt the best practices being
developed by the City Technology Colleges.'
The move received a frosty reception from teachers.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, said: 'Eventually, even this government will realise that what we
needed all along was better technology facilities in all schools, not just
their favourites.'

FT  06 JUL 93 / Teachers to continue boycott of school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's two largest teachers' unions yesterday said their members would
continue boycotting national curriculum tests in September.
This intensifies pressure for drastic changes to the tests. A review of the
curriculum being conducted by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman designate of the
Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, is expected to produce
preliminary conclusions at the end of the month.
Boycotts by all three main teachers' unions this year meant that scarcely
any pupils took the tests.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, made clear that his union would stop
the boycott if the review reduced their workload significantly. 'The boycott
will be rescinded if the promised reduction in workload is delivered on the
ground. The government could solve this problem by either slimming down the
national curriculum immediately or by limiting the number of hours teachers
could be called to work. These hours are currently unlimited.'
Mr de Gruchy indicated possible disagreement between the unions by adding
that the boycott would end even if Sir Ron recommended introducing simple
externally marked 'paper and pencil tests', although the union opposed them
on educational grounds.
He said that this would not provide legal backing for industrial action,
although it would take other measures, such as asking parents to withdraw
their children from the tests.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said
his union was taking action over objections to the tests' educational
content as well as workload. 'The boycott remains in place as long as the
assessment and testing arrangements remain,' he said.

FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Brazil tariff cuts begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE last round of Brazilian tariff reductions under former President
Fernando Collor's import liberalisation programme have come into operation
but they could be the last cuts until 1995, if leading politicians, business
people and labour officials get their way.
The average tariff dropped to 14 per cent, down from 17.1 per cent. The
standard tariff, charged for the greatest number of products, fell to 20 per
cent, and the maximum rate was reduced to 35 per cent.
Brazil's next scheduled revision is set for January 1995 under the Southern
Cone Common Market umbrella, when Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay
are to establish a unified external tariff system.
Business leaders have been insistent that tariff reductions should be put on
hold until there is a recovery in the Brazilian economy. They are also
urging the government to reduce tax rates and infrastructure costs.
Mr Luiz Fernando Furlan, international director for the Sao Paulo Federation
of Industry (FIESP), the country's leading business group says: 'The factors
that burden production are rooted in the government.'
Politicians and officials from the administration of President Itamar Franco
are cautious over further import liberalisation. Rising imports and actions
against Brazilian exporters, such as anti-dumping action by the US against
steel producers, have been adding fuel to the debate over trade.
Since last year, Brazilian chemical and petrochemical producers have been
increasingly vociferous in their calls for more anti-dumping regulations.
Some industries, including textiles and automobiles, are calling for import
quotas, arguing that these would reflect international practices.

FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: G7 summit failure 'would threaten world
economy'
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, warned yesterday that failure by the Group of Seven
leaders to inject new momentum into the stalled world trade talks at their
summit in Tokyo later this week would put not only the Uruguay Round but the
multilateral trading system and the world economy at risk.
'Concrete progress' on a package to open markets to foreign goods and
services was needed to relaunch the 116-nation negotiations in Geneva, he
said. With just five months before the December 15 deadline for concluding
the round, a failure to move forward would deal the round 'a very serious
blow' and endanger the multilateral trading structure built up since the
war.
In his first news conference since taking over at the helm of Gatt on July
1, Mr Sutherland said the best hope for the 26m jobless in the G7 countries
lay in bolstering business confidence with a rapid and successful conclusion
to the round. Calling on the summit to resist protectionist pressures, he
said some 23m jobs in the seven countries depended on exports of goods and
would be at risk from protection of ailing industrial sectors.
Mr Sutherland added that despite recent setbacks he expected a successful
conclusion to the round. 'I cannot believe we are capable of taking such a
collectively ridiculous decision as to endanger the multilateral system.'

FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Telecoms holding eastern Europe back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in eastern Europe and Russia see poor telecommunications as their
main infrastructure barrier to exports, according to a survey by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published at an FT
conference yesterday.
Among 800 companies in six countries surveyed - Russia, Lithuania, Hungary,
Romania, Poland and Latvia - inadequate telecommunications were a more
frequent source of complaint than transport links or border crossings.
Among Polish companies, telecommunications were rated the single greatest
domestic barrier to exports, more significant than exchange rates, the
instability of financial regulation, and other infrastructure shortcomings.
Speakers at the FT conference on telecommunications in central and eastern
Europe, held in Berlin, claimed that investment was falling far short of
that required to provide a basic service.
Mr Andres Bande, president of Ameritech International, the US operator, was
highly critical of the World Bank in its support for telecommunications
investment in the region. He estimated that Dollars 18.6bn (Pounds 12.4bn) a
year was needed over the next decade to take the number of phone lines from
12 per 100 people to the current level in Spain - 35 lines per 100. However,
in 1991 only Dollars 2.6bn was invested, and his projections for the rest of
the decade were 'way short' of the target.
Mr Alexander Aleshin, Russia's first deputy minister for telecommunications,
said Russia wanted to double its number of exchange lines by the year 2000.
He stressed the problems created by inadequate revenue from fees, despite
the deregulation of prices.
Mr Krzysztof Kilian, Poland's minister of telecommunications, said his
government wanted to reform Poland's telecommunication law to encourage
foreign investment. But he ruled out the introduction of competition in
trunk lines, and stressed the political problems of privatisation and
revised tariff structures needed to make investment more attractive.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, Germany's minister of posts and telecommunications, said
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, legislation for which is to be introduced
in the German parliament later this year, was necessary in part to leave
Telekom 'completely free in the international sphere'.
The OECD research also highlighted the high costs and financial insecurity
faced by operators in the former eastern bloc.
It found an average of nearly 18 employees per 1,000 main lines in eastern
Europe, compared with an OECD average of 7 per 1,000. Privatisation of
Deutsche Telekom is likely to take place in 'four or five steps' beginning
in late 1995 or 1996, Mr Botsch told the conference. He wanted network
modernisation to be a prime beneficiary of receipts from the sale, but he
had not yet discussed this with Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister.

   ALLEGED US dumping of soda ash
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the main ingredient in glass making, and a Dollars 650m (Pounds 430m)
business in Europe - is to be investigated by the European Commission,
following a complaint from European chemicals manufacturers.
The complaint, which is being pressed through Cefic, the European chemical
industry council, was heard yesterday by the EC's anti-dumping committee.
It is headed by Solvay, the Belgian company which is the world's leading
soda ash producer.
A spokesman claimed yesterday that US imports had increased from 50,000
tonnes in 1990 to 634,000 tonnes last year, while prices have dropped by 15
per cent since 1991. 'Some people would consider this to be a sign of
injury,' he said.
US soda ash manufacturers say sales to Europe have slumped by 25 per cent in
the first five months of 1993. They also insist that almost one third of US
exports are from subsidiaries owned by Solvay and Rhone-Poulenc.
Solvay claims that the dumping margin is as much as 15 per cent, and argues
that pressure from cheap US imports was one reason why it was forced to
close its 100-year-old soda ash plant in Couillet, Belgium, and to consider
closure of another plant at Heilbronn in Germany. However, both were small
and comparatively inefficient, and production has been shifted to newer
plants, including a new plant at Bernberg in eastern Germany.
Europe is one of the world's most fiercely protected soda ash markets, with
tariffs averaging 10 per cent. This compares with zero tariffs in Japan and
1.2 per cent in the US. In 1990, ICI and Solvay were fined a record Ecu47m
(Pounds 32m) for carving up the soda ash market. ICI has since sold its UK
production facilities to an Australian company.
Complaints by European manufacturers have risen recently as eastern Europe -
in particular Poland - has joined the US as an aggressive exporter of soda
ash.

look at the market implications of increased competition from eastern

<TEXT>
THE WEST European chemical industry has been making vociferous complaints
about the damage being wrought by increasing levels of east and central
European imports.
Last week, Cefic, the European chemical industry's trade association, urged
the EC to implement trade instruments against some imports from the region.
The grumbling comes in spite of the large overall benefits to the EC's
chemical industry from the opening of east and central European markets.
EC chemical exports to Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary,
Poland and Romania increased from Ecu1.38bn (Pounds 1.06bn) in 1990 to
Ecu2.10bn last year, according to figures from Eurostat, the EC's statistics
institute. The EC's surplus in chemicals trade with its eastern neighbours
rose to Ecu1.01bn last year from Ecu527m in 1990.
A large proportion of that improvement has been in high value medicines. The
EC's surplus in pharmaceuticals rose from Ecu175m in 1990 to Ecu371m last
year. However, such successes in high-value products are of little
consolation to west European commodity chemical companies suffering the
brunt of east European imports.
The loudest complaints have come from west European companies manufacturing
fertilisers, soda ash, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), caprolactam (a precursor of
nylon), and melamine (a plastic).
Imports of east European PVC, for example, have increased from 84,000 tonnes
in 1989 to 270,000 tonnes last year. Soda ash imports from the east have
risen from 27,000 tonnes to 162,000 tonnes. And imports of caprolactam have
gone up from 606 tonnes to 33,000 tonnes.
These imports have replaced west European production at a time when
manufacturers have been grappling with sluggish or falling demand. Western
manufacturers also argue that the flood of eastern imports has depressed
west European price levels, because the imports have been sold at unduly low
prices.
Admittedly, some sectors were suffering from significant structural
overcapacity before the appearance of large-scale eastern imports.
Nevertheless, the problem is serious in some markets, claims Mr Hugo Lever,
director general of Cefic.
Mr Richard Bauer, secretary general of the European Fertilisers
Manufacturers' Association (EFMA), warns: 'We want to help these countries,
but not if it means committing suicide.' Last year, the west European
fertiliser industry lost Dollars 1.1bn on a turnover of Dollars 8.4bn.
Between 1988-89 and 1991-92 imports of nitrogen fertilisers from central and
east Europe, excluding the former Soviet Union, have more than doubled from
366,000 tonnes to 827,000 tonnes, according to the EFMA. Their share of the
EC market has increased from 4 per cent to 9 per cent. Imports from the
former Soviet Union have increased from 59,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes.
'It's not just a question of the increasing penetration by east European
imports. It's the prices at which they are coming in. They've got no idea of
costs,' says Mr Bauer.
The position in PVC is broadly similar to that in fertilisers. Manufacturers
claim east and central European imports have aggravated an already difficult
situation.
Nearly half of PVC imports are now from eastern European suppliers. Polish
imports have increased from 17,000 tonnes in 1989 to about 67,000 tonnes
last year, according to Cefic. Over the same period, imports from the Czech
and Slovak republics have risen from 28,000 tonnes to 75,000 tonnes. By
1992, east European imports captured about 9 per cent of the EC market.
Mrs Josee Lafleur at Cefic argues most of the damage in the PVC market has
been generated through low-price imports undermining the pricing structure.
In Germany, Europe's largest market, the price of pipe-grade PVC slumped
last year from about DM1.75 a kilogramme to DM1. The industry needs about
DM1.45 to break even.
Western soda ash manufacturers, which include Solvay, Rhone-Poulenc and
BASF, also claim they are suffering, although their case is less convincing
than in the other sectors.
Imports from Bulgaria, the largest eastern importer, more than doubled from
42,000 tonnes in 1991 to 91,000 tonnes last year. But American imports have
caused far much more damage in volume terms, increasing from 350,000 tonnes
in 1991 to about 600,000 tonnes last year.
Meanwhile, in the caprolactam sector, Mr Hans van Liemt, president of DSM,
the Dutch group, says competition from eastern Europe has contributed to a
fall of up to 40 per cent in prices.
The reaction of the chemical industry as a whole to the east and central
European problem is one of ambivalence. So far, Cefic is not considering
anti-dumping action. Firstly it does not want to, and secondly, there are
difficulties of comparing prices in east Europe with those in the west.
'In principle we support the EC's efforts to liberalise trade with that part
of the world,' says Mr Lever. 'If we do not help they will never become
significant markets for our products. We must explain to these manufacturers
about marketing techniques.'
Even without western help, central and east European manufacturers are
beginning to learn about the adverse effects of aggressively priced imports.
Mr Lever says they too are suffering low-price imports - this time from the
former Soviet republics. With just a hint of Schadenfreude, he says:
'Hungarian fertiliser manufacturers are really beginning to suffer from
Russian imports.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS LESS than a week since Mr Zhu Rongji was invested with the
responsibility of taming China's runaway economy, but in keeping with a
reputation for decisiveness he has wasted little time in outlining his
strategy.
In a tough speech yesterday to government officials, Mr Zhu, senior
vice-premier and newly appointed governor of the central bank, said: 'China
must rectify financial order and strengthen financial discipline.'
While China's official media gave only sketchy details of Mr Zhu's remarks,
he has indicated there will be further increases in interest rates, cuts in
government spending, a tighter squeeze on new credit, stricter controls on
non-bank financial intermediaries, and a crackdown on dubious fund-raising
schemes such as enterprise bonds.
China's leaders have been panicked by a series of financial scandals and
signs of chaos in the banking system. Mr Zhu's main tasks will be to restore
order to the financial sector, while preserving market reforms that are the
basis of China's opening to the outside world.
China is also planning to overhaul its tax system in an effort to boost
receipts. Tax authorities have failed to keep pace with the explosion of
activity in the past year, with the economy continuing to surge ahead at
rates exceeding 13 per cent in the first five months of this year.
Mr Zhu, 65, has expressed particular concern about rampant speculation in
real estate, and lax controls over China's fledgling stock markets. He is
certain to add his weight to efforts to strengthen the regulatory
environment.
He would know that, with inflation spiralling towards 20 per cent in the
cities and amid signs of increasing unrest among hard-pressed farmers, that
he has little time to waste. He would also be aware that he has been handed
something of a poisoned chalice in his efforts to cure China's economic
ills.
Success would confirm his status in the front rank of Chinese leaders, and
strengthen his claims to the premiership. Failure would be penalised.
Among China's ruling seven-man standing committee of the politburo, Mr Zhu
is almost certainly best-qualified for the task of bringing order to the
economy. But it is also a measure of the paucity of talent at the top that
one man is being invested with such broad responsibilities.
Not least of his problems are the high expectations attached to confirmation
of his role as China's economic tsar. Indeed, Beijing's propaganda mill
wasted little time trumpeting his qualities.
Xinhua, the New China news agency, hailed his appointment and said he was
noted for his 'decisive handling of affairs'. His official biography speaks
of a 'learned man' who excels in economics and technological matters.
Mr Zhu, who was born in Changsha near Mao Zedong's birthplace, would not
need reminding of the fickleness of Chinese politics, having spent years in
the wilderness in the 1960s and 1970s after criticising government economic
policy.
China's new central bank governor is a former mayor and party boss of
Shanghai, where he earned a reputation as a bold reformist. An engineering
graduate from Qinghua University, one of China's leading institutions, he
has also served as a vice-minister of the State Economic Commission.
Fluent in English, he has impressed foreign visitors. He has also travelled
extensively - for a Chinese leader - and has visited Europe, North and South
America and Australia in the past few years.
He is a protege of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, who launched the
country's latest economic spurt last year with instructions to officials to
speed reform. But Mr Zhu is also known to have been urging for some time
tougher action to restrain the economy.
He is now being given the opportunity, belatedly perhaps, to assert the
control he has been advocating.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Election fall-out over NZ reform: Controversial plans for
sweeping healthcare changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE New Zealand government is pressing ahead with a sweeping and costly
shake-up of the health service despite an opposition promise to return to
the former system if elected in a general election later this year.
Controversy, which could resonate in Britain and the US, has surrounded the
reforms since they were announced in 1991 by the then health minister, Mr
Simon Upton.
He was replaced by Mr Bill Birch in March as government concern mounted over
the electoral damage the plan was causing.
One of Mr Birch's first acts as minister was to launch a NZDollars 3m
(Pounds 1m) television campaign to explain the changes - a move labelled by
the opposition Labour party, which leads in opinion polls, as 'political
propaganda'. The changes, which came into force this month, are directed
principally at funding, with the aim of introducing business efficiencies.
In future, large public hospitals, which have been renamed as crown health
enterprises or CHEs, are expected to be run on business lines.
New managers have been hired from the private sector at high salaries.
The CHEs are expected to return a dividend or make a profit, and compete
with private hospitals.
Healthcare funding is being split from the provision of services.
Four regional health authorities (RHAs) are taking over a budget of
NZDollars 4bn. The RHAs also get a further NZDollars 1bn to fund the cost of
disability services, previously the responsibility of the Social Welfare
Department.
The RHAs are known as the 'purchasers' of services. They will buy services
from the CHEs and any private organisation that can make competitive bids.
Doctors, after difficult negotiations, have agreed to a system of contracts
with the RHAs.
The government was accused of being undemocratic when it sacked elected
members of the former hospital boards and replaced them with its RHA and CHE
appointees. The meetings of these groups will not be open to the public.
The government believed the old system was wasteful and inefficient. But the
cost of setting up the news system has been substantial - more than
NZDollars 30m.
Ms Helen Clark, health spokeswoman for Labour, has warned of privatisation
through what she says is the 'Americanisation' of health services.
In defence of the new system, Mr Birch said: 'Money was dished out to the
old area health boards. But the elected members thought they were
accountable to their voters, so there was a conflict.' He added that the old
boards always blamed the government for not giving them enough funds and
claimed there was a lack of skill and competence in the boards.
He maintained that while the public would not notice any immediate
difference, he expected real improvements would soon start to show,
including reduced waiting times for surgery.
In response to criticisms last week that the new system was underfunded, the
minister announced that health would be given an extra NZDollars 128m in the
next financial year.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government, increasingly unpopular since its unexpected
election victory in March, risked a further downturn yesterday when it told
state premiers to tighten their belts, Reuter reports from Canberra.
Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance minister), facing a stagnant economy
and a ballooning budget deficit, asked premiers to come up with an austerity
plan to help save the government billions of dollars.
Mr Dawkins told the six state premiers his government had to fill a gap of
between ADollars 4bn and ADollars 10bn (Pounds 1.8bn and Pounds 4.5bn)to
achieve a budget deficit target of 1 per cent of gross domestic product
(GDP) by 1996-97. He told them to trim another ADollars 1.5bn to ADollars
3bn from their own budgets as part of a national strategy to turn around
record low levels of national savings.
Since its election win in March, the government has steadfastly repeated an
aim to cut the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97.
The actual 1992-93 deficit, announced on Sunday, was ADollars 14.5bn or 3.7
per cent of GDP, and the government has forecast an even higher deficit of
around ADollars 16bn for 1993-94.
Economists have said the 1 per cent target would require huge spending cuts,
new taxes or the dropping of big income tax cuts planned for 1994 and 1996.
An new opinion poll, published yesterday, showed Mr Keating's administration
is as unpopular as it was before the election. The Saulwick/Sydney Morning
Herald poll found Labor trailed the Liberal-National opposition by 39 per
cent to 47 per cent. The poll was taken a week ago.

FT  06 JUL 93 / 'Money is not everything, but having no money is worse': The
ideological dilemmas of the China that Zhu Rongji must tame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IT was reported in China recently that someone had paid Yn400,000
(Pounds 47,000) for a goldfish, People's Daily, the Communist party
newspaper, was aghast.
Launching a tirade rarely witnessed these days in its grey columns, the
paper railed against 'shockingly uncivilised' behaviour of the nouveaux
riches whom it accused of wanting nothing more than to flaunt their wealth.
By way of example it related the episode of two entrepreneurs, or get ti hu,
China's new class, who had set out to prove who was the wealthier by
lighting an endless string of fire crackers, and when this contest ended
inconclusively, they proceeded to set fire to handfuls of banknotes.
'People cannot see a trace of civilisation in these scenes,' People's Daily
thundered. 'Instead we see ugliness, vulgarity, ignorance and stupidity . .
.'
Behind this outburst, and other similar imprecations against 'money worship'
that are crowding China's official press, lies deepening concern over a
get-rich-quick mood that appears to have overtaken the country, exemplified
by several recent cases of massive fraud.
One involved a pyramid scheme in which an entrepeneur built a shell company
by issuing some Yn1bn of virtually worthless junk bonds to 100,000
investors. Another scam involved an attempt to skim the equivalent of Pounds
6.6bn from the Agriculture Bank of China using false letters of credit.
With Chinese enterprises having engaged in the past year or so in a barely
regulated bond-issuing binge it would be surprising if there were not vast
wads of worthless paper floating around the country.
China's embrace of capitalism, or to use its own phrase, 'socialism with
Chinese characteristics', is proving painful for the authorities who must
sense that old control mechanisms are crumbling, and mere words or even
political directives are insufficient to hold back the entrepreneurial tide.
In China, these days, nothing it seems, succeeds like excess.
Greed, accompanied by pervasive corruption, is already causing political
problems. Beijing has been obliged to rein in corrupt local officials who
have stirred peasant militancy by extorting fees from hard-pressed farmers.
The police have also been accused of falling victim to what Mr Jiang
Xianjin, the vice minister for public security, described recently as
'money-oriented ideology'. The minister ordered 'public security organs at
all levels' to clamp down on police extortion.
The Communist party, unsure how to ride the new capitalist tiger, has
intensified its campaign against corruption and money worship, the
officially sanctioned term for what is clearly perceived as society's chief
ill. But it is not clear that sterile demands to combat this modern disease
are having much effect.
Thus People's Daily's call for the broad masses to be educated in
'patriotism, collectivism, socialist thought and the spirit of working
arduously for the great cause' is unlikely to have cut much ice with those
it reported flaunting their wealth.
But at another level the emphasis in China on getting rich is stirring a
painful debate about the ethics of wealth and how to achieve material
well-being. The agony columns of Chinese newspapers are full of plaintive
letters from individuals who worry they are being left behind in the
scramble for money, and yet had not been prepared for such traumas in a
society where issues such as 'keeping up with the Wangs' stayed more or less
in the background.
Typical of these letters was one that appeared in the Tianjin Evening News
from a factory technician who lamented that attending a party with former
classmates recently he discovered that those whose 'pockets were bulging
with money' were the ones who were naughtiest when they were in the lowest
grades at school. Of himself, he said: 'It was people like me who finished
university who looked shabby and poor.'
Signing himself a 'useless man', the letter writer related his experience
with his daughter whom he was using his meagre savings to educate at a
fee-paying school, only to endure 'shame' when he discovered how much better
off other children were who were being delivered to the school in cars and
on motorcycles.
The letter writer could perhaps be forgiven for being confused, buffeted by
propaganda which on one hand has been urging Chinese to 'liberate their
thoughts', 'change their brains', 'get rich', and 'seize the opportunity';
and on the other being told to adhere to old-fashioned notions of 'socialist
morality' and 'selflessness'.
Little wonder that people are perplexed if China's rulers themselves seem to
be not quite sure whether they wish to advance to a glorious new
entrepreneurial dawn or to fall back on to old methods and slogans.
While most correspondence in China's party-controlled press reflects the
official line that money-worship is bad, there have been exceptions such as
a letter recently in the Workers' Daily. 'Some people say we should work
arduously and live frugally, which is not a wrong slogan theoretically. But
after all times are different now,' a writer said.
'For the past decades we became accustomed to living with a tightened belt.
Now, reform and opening have brought a better life to people, why should we
oppose money worship?
'We should pay some attention to moral issues,' the writer added. 'But I
think the time to do it is not yet ripe, for I'm afraid. . . it would slow
down the pace of people changing their brains and renewing their ideas.
Therefore, the building of morality should come slowly.'
While the writer did not say it outright, he appeared to be suggesting that
the accumulation of wealth should be the primary goal after the austerity of
the past 40 years.
'Money is not everything,' he wrote, 'but having no money is worse.' China's
rulers would seem to have their work cut out to counter the latter
sentiment.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Lagos hit by protest over poll backdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFFIC in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, was disrupted yesterday at the
start of a planned week-long protest called by civil rights activists, after
the military government's cancellation of the presidential election last
month.
A pall of smoke from burning tyres hung over some areas, but there were no
reports of violence in the city.
The government later warned it would take measures to enforce the rule of
law. It said its opponents, who included 'foreign forces', should not
mistake patience for weakness.
The protest was the most serious in Lagos since the annulment of elections
which Mr Moshood Abiola, a millionaire Moslem businessman, claimed to have
won, and the biggest in the city since riots in May 1992 over shortages of
fuel.
Civil disobedience in south-western Nigeria, organised by the Campaign for
Democracy (CD), is aimed at persuading Mr Abiola's Social Democratic party
(SDP) to reject President Ibrahim Babangida's plan to hold fresh elections
before a handover to civilian rule on August 27.
The non-party CD is the only group to take an uncompromising stance against
the government's latest agenda for transition to democracy. The group -
comprised of civil rights activists, students and academics - has called for
student groups to be formed to force the military government out of office.
Tens of thousands of people marched through the business centre of Lagos
Island and the densely populated mainland to a rally at the SDP's campaign
headquarters. Many protesters appeared to be 'area boys', youths hard hit by
unemployment brought on by Nigeria's battered economy.
A Reuter correspondent said protesters starting from Mr Abiola's home at
Ikeja in mainland Lagos had virtually taken over the suburb where the
domestic and international airports are.
'It's like a carnival,' he said.
Many of the protesters chanted or waved placards saying 'Go now IBB' (the
president's initials) or carried posters of Mr Abiola, declaring him the
election winner.
Markets and businesses stayed closed and public transport was scarce. The
main trunk road through the city was blocked by barricades and burning
tyres.
Last night, there were reports of similar protests elsewhere in southern
Nigeria.
Tight security was reported at Kano and Kaduna in the mostly Moslem north,
home region of Mr Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC),
the other presidential candidate in the June polls.
The SDP and the NRC have been holding meetings for the past week and were
due to meet President Babangida in the capital Abuja last night.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Unstable coalition predicted in Japan

JAPAN could face another general election in the next year as the poll later
this month is likely to create an unstable coalition government with a
limited life, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former Liberal Democratic party
powerbroker, forecast yesterday.
Campaigning has begun for the July 18 election, but Mr Ozawa, the force
behind the new Japan Renewal party, said the LDP would not gain a clear
majority and an opposition coalition, including the JRP, would have
difficulty staying together.
A Japanese television news poll yesterday found the leader of the JRP, Mr
Tsutomu Hata, was the most popular choice for the next prime minister. Mr
Ozawa said his party would consider a coalition with the opposition Social
Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, as long as Mr Hata
controlled the cabinet.
Mr Ozawa predicted this month's election would be the start of a
transitional period of instability, with the possibility of further splits
in the LDP and SDP, the creation of new parties, and the collapse of the
next government leading to a new election in the next year.
'If we have a non-LDP administration, the priority must be reform of the
political system, and then there will be real changes in the political
world,' Mr Ozawa said. By reform he meant redrawing of electoral boundaries
and replacement of the present multi-seat constituencies with single seats.
But he saw these structural changes as only the starting point for political
change which would end when there was a change in Japan's political
consciousness. 'We need to have a political system in which politicians are
responsible and take responsibility.'
He suggested the current election campaign was cheaper to run than those in
the past because of the rise of new parties and general enthusiasm for
reform, reducing the importance of corporate donations. Mr Ozawa was famed
at the LDP for his fund-raising abilities.
'It's different from past elections - we can feel the reform wind and it is
helping our campaign,' he said.

FT  06 JUL 93 / New Delhi to press ahead with reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA plans further substantial reforms over the next three years, according
to a Finance Ministry discussion paper marking the first two years of the
government's economic restructuring programme.
The document - Economic Reforms: Two Years After and the Task Ahead - says a
number of further measures are needed to remove disincentives to exports,
including the phasing out of quantitative restrictions on exports and
reductions in the customs duty structure.
The 1991 payments crisis which triggered the reforms underlined India's
vulnerability on the external payments front, it says. 'Rapid export growth
is the only sure way of achieving self-reliance, enabling us to finance our
import needs without excessive reliance on foreign borrowing.'
Among the changes planned are further cuts in subsidies, a more flexible
approach to prices administered by the government, a move to a simpler tax
structure with a broader base, greater emphasis on primary education and
basic health, and faster reform of the financial sector.
However, the ministry is restrained on plans for privatisation, a sensitive
political issue. It says there is 'considerable merit' in a proposal for a
committee on restructuring and disinvestment in public sector enterprises.
Among the committee's tasks would be to detect incipient financial problems
in the enterprises, and to shut down those which were irretrievably
loss-making.
It highlights a problem in the implementation of industrial reforms:
although the central government has removed many restrictions on industrial
investment and production, these are still pervasive in many states.
'The requirements for licences, permits and inspections at state and local
level continue to be onerous and extract a heavy toll in terms of effort and
resources from industrial units,' the report says. Companies face
difficulties in obtaining land, water and electricity.
To achieve its goal of reducing the central government's fiscal deficit to 3
per cent of GDP by 1996-97, the ministry plans further cuts in fertiliser,
food and energy subsidies. User charges for basic services such as
electricity, irrigation, road transport and non-primary education must be
raised progressively.
Where prices for services such as power and transport continue to be
administered by the government, they should be changed frequently to prevent
build-up of losses.
The ministry aims in the long term to introduce a value-added tax, but says
this requires constitutional changes on the allocation of taxation powers
between New Delhi and state governments.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Italians demand a say in Somalia: Soldiers' deaths shock
nation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday demanded a greater say in running the United Nations
military operations in Somalia, Unisom, as an emotional funeral was staged
for the three Italian soldiers killed in a skirmish on Friday in Mogadishu,
the Somali capital.
Also, in an usually outspoken statement on a foreign policy issue, Mr
Beniamino Andreatta, the foreign minister, said that the focus had to shift
towards finding a political solution in Somalia. If not, he warned, the UN
commitment risked being both ineffective and indefinite.
The soldiers' deaths - the first of Italian ground troops in combat since
the second world war - shocked the nation and prompted questioning about the
role of the 2,500 troops who are part of the UN mission there to stop
fighting and aid delivery of food to Somalis caught up in the civil war.
Italian opposition parties have called for the withdrawal of Italy's force.
Italy has been concerned for some time over the way the US military in
Somalia has failed to co-ordinate with their contingent. There has been at
least one incident in which US soldiers started operations without warning
in a zone allocated to Italian troops.
This has led to the despatch of a team to Washington to negotiate closer
co-ordination, and a meeting due to be held in New York on Thursday among
the seven main contributors to Unisom forces. The Italians originally
suggested the Unisom command be placed in the hands of one of their generals
but appears to have backed off this.
However, the Ciampi government is anxious to head of growing public concern
over the loss of life and injury of Italian troops with demonstrable
evidence that they have a more direct say in how operations are managed. Mr
Andreatta in this context sought yesterday to shift attention away from the
UN military enforcement action towards a political solution.
'Without a political solution, negotiated through all the parties so
bitterly involved in combat, any military action risks being completely
ineffective and could well lead to an indefinite presence,' Mr Andreatta
told parliament.
Germany's first big shipload of more than 1,000 vehicles and around 30
containers steamed for Somalia on Sunday after the Bonn parliament approved
a controversial troop deployment there, Reuter adds. A German army spokesman
said the 3,056-tonne Beerberg was carrying lorries, four-wheel drive trucks
and 11 armoured personnel carriers.

FT  06 JUL 93 / UK offers Pounds 15m development aid to Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday agreed to give Vietnam Pounds 15m to help in the
development of management expertise and infrastructure following President
Clinton's decision to end a US block on loans from international financial
institutions.
Mr Vo Van Kiet, Vietnam's prime minister, yesterday met Mr John Major, his
British counterpart, as part of a four-day visit to Britain which took place
in a new atmosphere of optimism about business prospects following Mr
Clinton's announcement last Friday.
Mr Kiet held talks with Lady Chalker, minister for overseas development,
Lord Wakeham, Lord Privy Seal, Mr John MacGregor, secretary of state for
transport, and Mr Eddie George, Bank of England governor. He has also met
executives of British Petroleum, British Aerospace, British Gas and John
Laing, the construction group, as well as many other British businessmen.
Britain, one of the leading investors in Vietnam, mostly in the oil and gas
sector, hopes to win an important role in carrying out urgently needed
improvements to Vietnam's infrastructure which will be funded by loans from
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank once the ban on multilateral
lending is lifted as a result of the latest Washington move.
The UK is granting Pounds 5m for a programme to train managers in industry
and finance, and will make Pounds 10m available to fund consultants who will
help Vietnam to establish priorities in infrastructure projects.
Non-US companies may have a temporary advantage in winning Vietnamese
business since Mr Clinton has given the go-ahead for international financing
but has not yet lifted a US trade embargo.
However, this may be short-lived. The International Monetary Fund's
executive board is expected next week to approve a plan for repayment of
Vietnam's arrears to the fund, but an IMF programme - a pre-requisite for
other multilateral lending - is unlikely to be in place until the autumn.
Some European officials expect Mr Clinton not to extend the embargo when it
comes up for renewal in September. He will come under strong pressure from
US business to lift the ban.

FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: US officials talk tough - off the record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS, like their counterparts everywhere, speak differently
depending on whether they are on or off the record. This has been more than
usually so in briefings on US hopes for the Group of Seven industrial
nations' summit in Tokyo this week.
Speaking for publication, and identifiable by name, President Bill Clinton
and senior administration members are bullish about both the economic and
political debate in Tokyo. The president, in his interview with foreign
correspondents last Friday, had little doubt that the G7 could still serve a
valuable problem-solving purpose under US example and leadership.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, was more colloquial. Economic
summits, he said, 'usually don't bring surprises and if they do something's
wrong'.
But he followed deflation with inflation. At Tokyo, he said, 'there is
something of a surprise and it is a pleasant one because economics is
actually at the top of the agenda again - and it's pocketbook economics -
jobs, growth and trade.'
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, trots off the economic
agenda, including aid to Russia, before waxing eloquent about the symbolic
and practical significance of the fact that Mr Clinton's first foreign trip
outside North America is to Asia.
For the record, US officials emphasise how much of a leadership role the US
has played since Mr Clinton took office - in finally meeting the
long-standing demands of its G7 partners that it do something about its
budget deficit and in putting together the assistance package for Russia.
All subscribe to the importance of reaching a Uruguay Round trade agreement
by the end of the year, without raising hopes for Tokyo.
All are equally circumspect about the bilateral negotiations with Japan. Mr
Bentsen talks about 'an outside chance' of a breakthrough in Tokyo, while Mr
Christopher, a shade tougher but also further removed from the talks, points
out that Mr Miyazawa 'is acting for the Japanese government' and thus
technically not yet without authority.
However, off the record, the language is less diplomatic. US officials see
the attack by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, on US
anti-dumping levies on steel as egregious and ignorant and French policies
generally as a serious threat to any hopes for the Uruguay Round. Mr
Balladur, who is absenting himself from Tokyo, was described by one senior
official as an outright protectionist and obstructionist, out of the
ordinary even by French standards.
Nor is there any sympathy for the EC's latest stand on trade in textiles, a
simmering issue but not one the US had thought could block the round.
However, there remain hopes of sufficient accord between US and EC positions
to make some form of market access agreement feasible.
Mr Clinton declines to criticise the monetary policies of the Bundesbank,
because it is an independent central bank. But other officials will go to
Tokyo with charts pointing out how much growth can be generated in the US
economy by each basis point reduction in interest rates, presumably with a
view to suggesting that Germany is not so different from the US that the
same results cannot be achieved.
Officials can be caustic in private about Japan, too, reflecting the
constant see-saw battle inside the administration between the Japan-bashers
and those seeking more creative engagement.
Last week, out of deference to Japan's political uncertainty, the US
postponed retaliatory sanctions against Japanese discrimination against
foreign construction contractors. But there was no evidence of any weakening
of the US view that its proposed new framework for negotiations, which
includes voluntary numerical targets for import penetration and reduction of
the Japanese current account surplus, was reasonable.
Perhaps the bleakest Tokyo prospect of all - and about the only one which
ever causes the name of Britain to pass the lips of US officials - concerns
Bosnia. All Mr Christopher would say, on the record, was 'I don't have any
idea what the political communique will say with respect to that.'
Mr Clinton's advice is not to pay too much attention to whatever is in the
summit communiques, mostly drafted in advance. He professes no interest in
summit formalities - communiques and dinners. He wants a proper talking
shop, on or off the record.

<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, warned yesterday that failure by the Group of Seven
leaders to inject new momentum into the stalled world trade talks at their
summit in Tokyo later this week would put not only the Uruguay Round but the
multilateral trading system and the world economy at risk.
'Concrete progress' on a package to open markets to foreign goods and
services was needed to relaunch the 116-nation negotiations in Geneva, he
said. With just five months before the December 15 deadline for concluding
the round, a failure to move forward would deal the round 'a very serious
blow' and endanger the multilateral trading structure built up since the
war.
In his first news conference since taking over at the helm of Gatt on July
1, Mr Sutherland said the best hope for the 26m jobless in the G7 countries
lay in bolstering business confidence with a rapid and successful conclusion
to the round.
Mr Sutherland added that despite recent setbacks he expected a successful
conclusion to the round. 'I cannot believe we are capable of taking such a
collectively ridiculous decision as to endanger the multilateral system.'

FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Tail-end Yeltsin asks for more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin has three requests for more, to put to
leaders of the Group of Seven when he attends the tail-end of their summit
in Tokyo this week: more money, more trade and more understanding.
Although support for Russia's market reforms is not high on their list of
priorities, it is one of the few areas on which leaders of the world's seven
richest countries will be able to agree.
'The rails have already been laid down for this,' said one western diplomat,
referring to the Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28.6bn) package of aid and loans drawn
up in April. Some of it has already been delivered, in the shape of a
Dollars 15bn debt rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor governments.
The only disagreement is over the size of a fund which Russia wants to help
in the restructuring of its industrial enterprises after their rough and
ready privatisation. Europe and Japan have already scaled it down - to about
Dollars 2bn from the Dollars 4bn requested by US President Bill Clinton.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russian finance minister, who is accompanying Mr Yeltsin
to Tokyo for the meeting on Friday, says the only 'real failure' since April
has been the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's inability to
deliver, 'even in prototype form', a Dollars 300m fund to promote small
businesses.
But, as he battles at home on several fronts, Mr Yeltsin wants to avoid
appearing a weak supplicant on the international stage. 'Yeltsin is quite
cautious. He does not want to be in the position of (former Soviet leader Mr
Mikhail) Gorbachev in London in 1991. He wants to come for concrete
results,' Mr Fyodorov said.
Unlike Mr Gorbachev, who presented an unimpressive reform programme when he
made a first request for G7 support, Mr Yeltsin has earned and received
western support since launching economic reforms in January 1992.
The relationship has developed so far that the Russian president will even
be able to tell western leaders what he does not want from them. For
instance, he will be pressing for more western assistance in the form of
grants and soft loans, saying that loans at commercial interest rates to pay
for western imports do not really amount to help.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations,
said at the weekend Russia could not afford to borrow more than Dollars 5bn
of the G7 package's Dollars 10bn in export credits and guarantees.
Western leaders in turn should be able to conclude that setting conditions
for western support, as a way to further reforms in Russia, can work. This
thesis was somewhat discredited last year when domestic political pressure
caused Mr Yegor Gaidar, the reformist prime minister who launched market
reforms, to fail to deliver over-ambitious promises to the International
Monetary Fund.
But, since Mr Yeltsin's referendum victory over his conservative opponents
in April, Mr Fyodorov and other reformers in the government have been able
to secure a liberalisation of coal prices and big increases in interest
rates, as part of the conditions for a new Dollars 1.5bn loan from the IMF
granted last week.
Mr Yeltsin has said his most important task at the summit is to end trade
'discrimination' against Russia, so that it shall be in a stronger position
to help itself through increased export revenues.
It is difficult to see what concessions can be granted at Tokyo on this
front, apart from a vague statement supporting Russia's speedy admission to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and a pledge to remove
outstanding Cold War restrictions.
Mr Shokhin says the most useful result of the summit would be 'a change in
language' to one between equals.
For Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, the
enterprise fund is of utmost importance for the west to prove itself a
'historic partner' in Russia's striving for economic freedom and democracy.
As he sets about transferring to private hands half Russia's industrial
capacity this year alone, his main concern is to prevent privatisation being
discredited by failures while domestic credit is increasingly hard to come
by.
Mr Fyodorov says his top priority at Tokyo is to start discussing further
loans from the IMF - including a a more traditional stand-by loan which
carries stricter conditionality and which Moscow wants to conclude by
October 1.
He will also be telling G7 leaders that Russia is on track to cut its budget
deficit and inflation rate, and that the rouble has at last stabilised at
about 1,000 to the dollar.
There are doubts as to how these developments may last but progress has been
made in furthering market mechanisms - for instance, in widening the foreign
exchange market and controlling the distribution of central bank credits.

TRADE officials of the US, Japan, Canada and the European Community were
last night locked in negotiations in a last-minute effort to agree a broad
market access deal for goods and services, aimed at reviving the stalled
Uruguay Round of trade talks.
The official-level talks are to be followed by a trade ministers' meeting of
the four today at which participants hope to agree a package and approve a
report to present to the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo tomorrow.
However, considerable differences still existed, making it necessary to
extend the official-level talks until the eve of the ministers' meeting.
The final ministers' meeting before the summit comes after the four failed
to agree a market access package at a meeting in Tokyo less than two weeks
ago.
US reluctance to reduce tariffs on textiles sufficiently to satisfy other
members, Japan's refusal to do the same for spirits and wood products, and
the EC's position on electronics were seen then as big obstacles to a
wide-ranging package.
Failure to reach agreement on a market access package would endanger hopes
of concluding the long-stalled Uruguay Round this year.

FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Lame duck Miyazawa will try to do his duty -
Japan's premier faces a clash between his responsibilities as G7 host and as
a leading LDP campaigner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations this week has
become caught in the swirl of campaigning for Japan's snap general election
on July 18. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa is almost certain not to remain prime
minister after the election.
His mismanagement of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's warring factions
provoked the split in its ranks which led to its defeat in a no confidence
motion, thence to the election.
Since then, Mr Miyazawa's authority has drained away. Mr Michio Watanabe,
former foreign minister, has called for his resignation. Mr Kabun Muto,
present foreign minister, who will be alongside the prime minister at many
of the summit sessions, has remarked darkly that Mr Miyazawa's greatest
contribution to the LDP election campaign might be to die suddenly,
inspiring sympathy votes.
In spite of the attacks on him within his own party, as well as from the
opposition, Mr Miyazawa will want to be seen to be fulfilling his national
and party duty.
The LDP will want to use the summit to show it is the only party capable of
the statemanship needed to represent Japan at the top table of international
politics. Mr Miyazawa will make polite noises about Japan's aspiration to
become a permanent member of the United Nations security council, about its
international aid programme and its role as a representative of Asian
interests within the G7.
Yet several issues will present him with a clash between his
responsibilities as host and his duties as leading LDP campaigner.
President Bill Clinton and other leaders are likely to play up the
significance of the planned Dollars 2bn privatisation fund for Russia, even
though most of the money will be redirected from existing aid programmes.
The idea of giving more money to Russia is unpopular in Japan, however,
partly because President Boris Yeltsin has twice cancelled recent visits to
Tokyo to discuss unsettled territorial disputes.
As host, Mr Miyazawa will be unable to distance himself from the fund, which
he will officially present to the world. As LDP leader, he knows his party's
electoral standing would be improved by taking a hard line on the issue.
So one of the more significant meetings for Japan could be Mr Miyazawa's
session with Mr Yeltsin. The LDP hopes the Russian leader will stress the
significance he attaches to good relations with Tokyo and promise to
reschedule his visit. Such a pledge might soothe Japan's badly wounded pride
and get Mr Miyazawa out of his dilemma.
Electoral considerations will also weigh heavily in Japan's conduct of talks
with the US and over the Gatt world trade negotiations. Mr Miyazawa will not
want to be seen to concede anything to the US president on trade talks
between the two countries. A tougher line will play better with the Japanese
electorate.
Japan would like to claim responsibility for overseeing a Gatt talks
breakthrough, but it will not make concessions that could hurt domestic
constituencies which, two weeks later, could punish the LDP.
Even so, Mr Miyazawa will not be able to do much about his main problem  -
his image as a tired, ageing politician alongside the youthful Mr Clinton,
who is to meet some of the opposition leaders who could form the next
government.
The president's zest will only strengthen the reformers' argument -
particularly that of relatively young leaders such as Mr Morihiro Hosokawa
of the New Japan Party and Mr Tsutomu Hata of the Japan Renewal Party - that
Japanese politics needs to jump generations so as to produce new policies
for Japan's expanding world role.
The more this is Mr Clinton's summit, the less it will be Mr Miyazawa's. A
few months ago, the latter was looking forward to the summit as a staging
post to his second two-year term as LDP president and prime minister.
Instead, it could be an uncomfortable end to a long career at the top of
Japanese politics.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Venezuela's slip from spoils to scarcity / Examining how a
two-party national political scene is disintegrating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO parties which have run Venezuela since its return to democracy in
1958 are struggling in the face of elections this year.
The leaders of the parties - Democratic Action (AD) and the Social Christian
Copei - used to thrive by judicious division of the country's oil wealth
among the elite groups which, with them, ran the country: business, trade
unions and the military.
Now that is over. Oil income has fallen sharply and a system of government
equipped to divide spoils has found it almost impossible to allocate scarce
resources. The parties, especially their leaders, are widely blamed for
Venezuela's decade-long economic decline.
Of the leading candidates for the December presidential election, only one,
former president Mr Rafael Caldera, can be described as a politician of the
old school, but he is not standing for a traditional party.
Mr Caldera, 77, was forced to defect from Copei, the party he founded, to
stand for president this time. As the candidate of the Movement to Socialism
(MAS), he is sharing the lead in opinion polls, with support of up to 30 per
cent.
Mr Caldera has managed, by shifting parties, to avoid the perception that he
is an party machinator in the old style. He has catered to popular
demonology; his populist campaign is attacking President Carlos Andres
Perez, now suspended from office on corruption charges, and the latter's
economic reform package. Mr Caldera is also laying into the discredited
leaders of the traditional parties, known as the cogollos.
The other front-runner, say opinion polls, is Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, 50,
governor of the important western oil state of Zulia and Copei's
presidential candidate. A man from outside the party mainstream, he defeated
the traditional Copei runner, Mr Eduardo Fernandez, in a primary.
Mr Fernandez suffered because he was too closely identified with the
cogollos. Now, says Mr Anbal Romero, a political scientist close to Mr
Fernandez, Copei is 'a party without a candidate that has a candidate
without a party'.
Much of the old AD party machinery is also withholding support from its
party's candidate, Mr Claudio Fermn, 43. The polls show him, also chosen by
primary, attracting less than 10 per cent support. For the moment, links to
AD appear to be more of an electoral liability than an asset, in part
because of the deep unpopularity of Mr Perez, an AD veteran.
Polls say Mr Andres Velasquez of the left-wing Causa R and governor of the
eastern industrial state of Bolvar, is attracting support in the percentage
high-teens, often from disaffected AD voters.
Despite apparent growing momentum behind Causa R, Mr Velasquez is given only
an outside chance of winning the presidency. Some politicians with contacts
in the military say there is also doubt over whether the armed forces would
accept a Causa R administration. So some analysts think Mr Velasquez, still
only 39, might be do well to throw his support behind Mr Caldera, to form a
powerful left-leaning coalition. Then he could benefit by a degree of power
under a Caldera presidency and position himself for a future presidential
race.
Left or right, a future president will have to confront, sooner or later,
the dire state of Venezuelan government finances - which will be only partly
ameliorated if proposed tax legislation becomes law - and the deplorable
condition of public services. It is difficult to see how these problems can
be resolved in a non-inflationary manner without further fundamental reform
of the state.
Yet such reform is almost a taboo word for Venezuelan politicians seeking
election. Mr Alvarez Paz is the candidate most closely associated with
reform. When he secured the nomination in early May, euphoria ensued in
financial markets.
Yet what may be popular with bankers may be an electoral liability: Mr
Alvarez Paz is thought likely to have to downplay economic reform in his
campaign. Even if he wins, the governor will be a president elected by a
minority and unlikely to have a secure majority in Congress.
In fact, whoever wins, Congress is likely to be more fragmented - because of
the declining popularity of the traditional parties and the fact that, as in
1988, half the deputies in the lower house will be elected from
constituencies, rather than from the traditional party slate.
The legislature will also probably be antagonistic to reform.
According to some, potential antagonism between the presidency and Congress
will be accentuated by the effort to impeach Mr Perez - sucessful so far -
which legislators may try to emulate against other unpopular presidents.
All of which suggests Venezuela will remain difficult to govern for the
foreseeable future. Asked how he rated the chances of the next president
ruling constitutionally for his full five-year term, Mr Romero answered:
'Not very high, I'm afraid.'

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Suharto, the Indonesian leader and head of the Non-Aligned
Movement, yesterday urged the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialised
nations to reach a quick agreement on the liberalisation of farm trade,
which would assist developing countries.
In a pre-G7 meeting, Mr Suharto told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime
minister, that a settlement of the Uruguay Round of trade talks must be
fashioned with the needs of developing countries in mind, as these were
particularly vulnerable to shifts in trade policy and protectionism.
Mr Suharto, in his role as chairman of the 108-member group, said economic
assistance from developed countries should not be linked to human rights
issues. He was reflecting the concerns of various developing countries, in
particular China, which complains that the US has linked trade and aid
policies to progress in human rights issues.
Mr Suharto did not get his original wish to address the summit himself.

TRADE officials of the US, Japan, Canada and the European Community were
last night locked in negotiations in a last-minute effort to agree a broad
market access deal for goods and services, aimed at reviving the stalled
Uruguay Round of trade talks.
The official-level talks are to be followed by a trade ministers' meeting of
the four today at which participants hope to agree a package and approve a
report to present to the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo tomorrow.
However, considerable differences still existed, making it necessary to
extend the official-level talks until the eve of the ministers' meeting.
The final trade ministers' meeting before the summit comes after the four
failed to agree a market access package at a ministers' meeting in Tokyo
less than two weeks ago.
At that time, US reluctance to reduce tariffs on textiles sufficiently to
satisfy other members, Japan's refusal to do the same for spirits and wood
products, and the EC's position on electronics were seen as big obstacles to
a wide-ranging package.
Failure to reach agreement on a market access package would endanger hopes
of concluding the long-stalled Uruguay Round this year.
Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director general of Gatt, has called the G7
summit in Tokyo a 'crucial catalyst' for rescuing the stalled round.
Officials in Tokyo were, however, cautious about the prospects for reaching
agreement so late in the day. Whatever progress is made will be made
hereafter, said one official yesterday.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the 13-nation Caribbean Community begin their annual summit today
seeking ways to cushion the region's small, open and fragile economies and
to limit the dislocation caused by changes in the global economy.
High on the summit's agenda will be the potentially damaging impact of the
North American Free Trade Agreement. Despite delays in the path of the
agreement's implementation, the Caricom countries are pressing ahead with
plans to protect their preferential markets in the US and Canada,
particularly from Mexican products.
Caricom and Central American states are pinning many hopes on draft
legislation being proposed by Mr Sam Gibbons, a Florida congressman who is
chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House ways and means committee. It
asks that regional exports to the US which are not now given preferential
access should be treated favourably for the first three years of Nafta.
The 24 countries in central America and the Caribbean benefiting from
Washington's Caribbean Basin Initiative for the past nine years have
suffered a collective trade deficit with the US, and they have argued that
they could do better if several products, now denied, could be given
preferential treatment under the 'Nafta parity bill'. These include textile
and apparel, footwear and other leather goods and petroleum products.
During the three years the CBI countries would have the opportunity of
negotiating their future trade relationship with the Nafta signatories, with
options of seeking membership either as individual states or as a group such
as the Central American Common Market or Caricom. They would also have a
safety net in that they could return to the status quo under the CBI.
The Caricom leaders will also deal with the controversy over access for
bananas to the European market, particularly the continuing efforts by Latin
American producers to have the the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
rule on the propriety of the EC's new import regime, implemented last week,
which favours fruit from traditional sources, including the Caribbean, while
limiting access to cheaper Latin American fruit.
Since it was created 20 years ago, Caricom has struggled, with limited
success, to realise the integration of the region's economies, leading
eventually to the creation of a common market.
Several delegates to the summit have suggested that unless the deliberations
conclude at the weekend with clear indications of how Caricom intends to
deal with these and other problems, public credibility in the achievement of
a common market for its 6m people will fall even lower.

<TEXT>
A BRITISH woman aid worker and an 11-year-old girl were killed yesterday in
fresh violence in Sarajevo, as conditions continued to deteriorate in the
besieged Bosnian capital, report Laura Silber and Agencies.
The aid worker, named by the Foreign Office in London as Christine Witcutt,
56, was shot by a sniper as she was driving out of the city in a truck
emblazoned with the words 'Don't shoot'. She worked for the Edinburgh Direct
Aid private charity.
Her husband was driving another truck in a convoy of six vehicles that had
taken relief supplies to Sarajevo at the weekend.
The girl who died was one of 12 children hit by exploding mortar bombs
during a renewed Serbian bombardment of the city. She died on the operating
table of a hospital.
Relief workers said the situation in the city was becoming unbearable, with
hospitals unable to keep blood plasma without power to run refrigerators. UN
officials have expressed grave concern about the possible outbreak of
typhoid and cholera because of the lack of electricity and running water.
Meanwhile, Gen Rasim Delic, commander of the Moslem-led Bosnian army,
ordered his troops to grant safe passage to two Bosnian Croat commanders
blockaded inside a Canadian UN base in central Bosnia. Sarajevo radio said
United Nations officials mediated their release in exchange for four Moslems
held by Croat troops.
Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president, arrived in Belgrade
yesterday to appeal for the release of arrested opposition chief Vuk
Draskovic and his wife Danica.

FT  06 JUL 93 / A debut of fire for Turkey's premier: First woman PM names
cabinet amid troubles at home and abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Tansu Ciller's first days as Turkey's new prime minister have been
nothing if not fiery.
The country's first woman prime minister is barely a week into the job, and
the international focus is back on Turkey's Kurdish rebellion, its single
biggest problem. At the same time, Turkey's image as a secular democracy has
been badly damaged by the spectre of Islamic fundamentalism, after the
deaths of 37 people, when radical Moslems last week set fire to a hotel
where the Turkish publisher of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses was staying.
And Turkey's best efforts to encourage peace in the Caucasus are in tatters,
after the ousting of President Abufaz Elchibey of Azerbaijan.
Now Mrs Ciller faces dissent from among her own backbenchers over the
composition of her cabinet, announced on June 25.
As if that was not enough, amid the continuing debate about the status of
Turkish workers in Germany, opposition parties have turned on Mrs Ciller,
questioning her patriotism after allegations she applied for US citizenship
when she was lecturing there in the 1980s. Mrs Ciller's two children have
dual nationality.
However, after the shock of the fundamentalist violence, *something in here
(HP) *
deputies rallied behind her yesterday, securing a vote of confidence in
parliament.
An impulsive character, Mrs Ciller, aged 47, was faulted during her term as
economics minister for not building a consensus behind her policies. An
unknown force in party terms - she only joined the True Path Party (DYP) in
1990, entering parliament in 1991 - she has now to prove she can handle the
rough and tumble of Turkish politics.
She has her hands full. The Kurdish crisis deteriorated with the
co-ordinated violent protests in European cities two weeks ago in the wake
of the breakdown of a recent rebel ceasefire. More worrying, the Kurdish
Workers party, the PKK, has for the first time extended its nine-year
campaign of violence to Turkey's tourist resorts with a bomb attack recently
at Antalya on Turkey's Mediterranean coast.
Like Mr Suleyman Demirel, whom she replaced when he acceded to the
presidency after Mr Turgut Ozal's death in April, Mrs Ciller promises a
two-pronged policy on the Kurds. It offers them legal and cultural rights
while giving carte blanche to the military to prosecute what, with the
recent backlash against Kurdish properties in western Turkey, looks like
becoming a full-scale civil conflict.
Diplomats are concerned about her appointment of the untried Mr Mehmet
Gazioglu as interior ministry. They fear he may not have the grasp of the
difficult law and order portfolio, not just in tackling the rebellion but in
curbing the excesses of the security forces - a big problem given Turkey's
bid to improve its human rights image abroad.
On the foreign policy front, Mrs Ciller's immediate task is Azerbaijan,
where Mr Gaidar Aliyev the former communist boss has wrested power from the
luckless Mr Elchibey.
The Azeri envoy in Ankara, sought to reassure Turkey this week that
commercial deals undertaken by the Elchibey administration would be
honoured. However Mr Elchibey was the central player in Turkey's policy in
the Caucasus, where support for the moderate forces in Azerbaijan, Armenia
and Georgia was viewed as the only way to bring peace to a volatile
ethnically-riven region.
In choosing her cabinet, Mrs Ciller gave a clear warning that she intends to
be her own woman and not defer to Mr Demirel, her political mentor.
On paper at least, with 17 new ministers, the 32 member cabinet was a
radical transformation, with the departure of most of the Demirel loyalists.
The changes represent a Turkish version of musical chairs where Mrs Ciller
paid tribute to her supporters in the only way available to her, by
dispensing ministerials jobs.
Mrs Ciller has chosen to retain the economic portfolio herself. She will
have a difficult task meeting her promise of farm reform in a party which
depends on rural constituencies where subsidies will be hard to withdraw.
She can expect even more resistance to her privatisation programme from her
coalition partners the Social Democratic Populists SHP, traditionally the
party of organised labour and white collar civil servants.
As a political outsider her Mrs Ciller's immediate task is to secure her
footing in the party and outmanoeuvre her rivals and Mr Demirel who is known
to be unhappy about her appointment.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Dalmatians count cost of war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE Republic of Dalmatia,' proclaims a banner headline in a satirical
newspaper published in Split, Croatia's port city on the Adriatic.
With no prospect of gaining Serb-held territory, the headline is indicative
of the mood in Croatia. The once prosperous Dalmatian coast has started
questioning the stewardship of Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia.
All but cut off from mainland Croatia by Serb-held territories under UN
protection, Dalmatia's inhabitants have been hit hard by the forgotten war.
Previously accustomed to a comfortable style afforded by tourist receipts,
which amounted to as much as Pounds 2bn a year, they are living under
stringent restrictions with daily power cuts.
Many Dalmatian towns are hostage to Serb rebels who lob artillery from the
hinterland. Inflation is running at 25 per cent a month. Croatia's current
GNP of Pounds 5.3bn is 30 per cent of the pre-war GNP, estimates Mr Zvonimir
Baletic, a Zagreb economist.
Aware of growing discontent, President Tudjman on Sunday vowed to assert
control over 'every inch of Croatian territory. . . if necessary by force.'
Speaking in Split, he promised that trains would soon resume service to the
Adriatic through Knin, the rail junction which is also the centre of the
self-styled Serb state which cuts Croatia in half.
'It is not only for the good of Dalmatia, but for Croatia as well,' he said.
His ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) is bitterly divided over how to
establish control over the republic's borders.
One faction headed by Mr Gojko Susak, defence minister, is aggressively
pursuing the carve-up of neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina with Serbia.
In an interview this week, he said Croatia will seize control of the
frontiers by the end of the year 'with or without the UN.' According to a
recent oppinion poll published in Globus, the Zagreb weekly, 70 per cent of
Croatians favour war to re-assert control over the borders.
Mr Susak denied accusations that he wants to annex Hercegovina to Croatia,
although last month he reportedly hoisted a Croatian flag over the central
Bosnian town of Travnik.
The HDZ hardliners are at loggerheads with a corp of old-time politicians
opposed to the partition of neighbouring Bosnia. Critics of Mr Susak's
nationalist Hercegovina lobby have warned that the carve-up would set a
dangerous precedent for Croatia which could become an unstable confederation
with Serb rebels.
In an interview with Danas, the Zagreb news weekly, Mr Franjo Greguric,
director of the Croatian oil company INA, said: 'I don't think Croatia
should permit three states to be created out of Bosnia before resolving the
status of the UN zones and returning them to Croatian control.
'I am more afraid of the regionalisation that is brewing in Croatia.'
But an opposition politician sees increased autonomy for regions of Croatia
as the only blueprint for a stable democracy. 'There is no other choice for
the state. Croatia needs the renewal of regions with a strong degree of
autonomy,' he said.

Elsewhere in Bosnia, Serb and Croat forces used 'all available weapons' to
step up joint attacks on Maglaj, Zavidovici and Zepce, the strategic
triangle of towns in north-central Bosnia, Sarajevo radio reported.
At least five people were killed when fighters from the Croatian Defence
Council (HVO) shelled Mostar in the south-west. Trapped Moslems were
'literally dying' without water or food in soaring temperatures, the radio
said.
Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president, yesterday travelled
to Belgrade to plead for the release of Mr Vuk Draskovic, the jailed
opposition leader. Government physicians yesterday said Mr Draskovic's
condition had 'deteriorated.' He began a hunger strike at the weekend to
press the Serb authorities to release him.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy yesterday cut its discount rate by a full percentage point
to 9 per cent, the lowest level since 1976.
The cut, effective from today, follows the four-year pact agreed on Saturday
between employers and trade unions on wages and working conditions.
The agreement also enabled Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, to
leave for the Tokyo G7 summit with clear evidence of his government's
determination to hold down inflation and tackle the public sector deficit.
Mr Ciampi had set Saturday as the deadline for Confindustria, the
industrialists' confederation, and the three trade union confederations to
resolve the issue.
The agreement is Mr Ciampi's first important achievement since taking office
two months ago. Nevertheless, the outcome still leaves Italy with the most
rigid labour system in the EC.
The wage element in Italy's high labour costs may now tend downwards but
other aspects - such as social security, pensions and job security  - are
scarcely affected.
However, the deal is a compromise with many unresolved aspects. The most
important is how to tackle employers' demands to avoid matching a rise in
social security contributions on a wage increase above the national minimum.
This issue had been one of the sticking points in the talks and had to be
left out of the agreement.
As a result the agreement will not be signed until July 22. This will give
Mr Ciampi time to produce a proposal, probably based on offering tax
concessions against the extra cost of social security contributions.
The union leadership will also have time to test the reaction of its
members, who could be hostile.
Within the framework of a four-year pact, the trade union leadership has
accepted that wages cannot match inflation and that increases must be linked
to productivity.
This endorses the parlous state of Italy's public finances and company
profitability.
Another union concession has been to drop opposition to the principle of
temporary employment and lower starting salaries.
Acceptance of lower starting salaries is the first step towards breaking
down labour rigidities.
In return for union concessions, the government has agreed to speed benefits
applied to workers who are temporarily laid off and to extend lay-off
payments to small companies.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Defiant outpost awaits the Armenian onslaught: Azeris are
reeling before a military offensive from Nagorno-Karabakh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLONEL Eyvan Jafarov commands the last Azeri outpost in Nagorno-Karabakh.
The army post is outside the village of Markara, 4km inside the Karabakh
border and it is unlikely he will hold out for long.
The colonel expects a push against his base this morning. A veteran of the
Soviet army with service in Russia, Kazakhstan and east Germany, he has a
handful of teenagers and big guns whose numbers he will not reveal.
'No matter if they send me more troops or not,' he shrugs, 'we stay here and
do our duty.' In command of a sloppy and demoralised army, he tries to stick
to the book. 'Do up your button,' he orders a lad clattering down the stairs
with a Kalashnikov, and does it up for him.
But Col Jafarov's last stand is an anomaly. At Agdam, 5km inside Azerbaijan
itself, the town is all but surrounded by Armenian forces from Karabakh. On
Sunday evening refugees streamed out of the town in trucks, farm wagons and
carts. The flames from the villages burning to the south of the town were
clearly visible from the road.
In the administration building near the centre of the town, Mr Alsif
Cherimov said the Armenians were only a few hundred yards away. On a map,
his colleagues pointed to a crescent of villages to the south of Agdam taken
on Saturday and Sunday in the Armenian offensive.
The firing and shelling eased yesterday, only to increase around midday. A
walk about the town, however, showed that the Armenians were close: the
Azeri forces are holding a perimeter 1km or so out, just beyond the suburbs.
But the town is demoralised and weak and the Armenians can fire at will on
it and on the road out.
Agdam is important. Mr Fakhredin Abusov, the deputy administrator of the
border town of Ter-Ter, said that 'if Agdam goes to the Armenians, many say
why should we stay in Azerbaijan. It will be the end of us'.
More than that, Agdam has for the past two years been the main frontline
base for the Azeris in their operations against Nagorno-Karabakh. The
Armenians came close to it early last year: the Azeri counter-offensive in
the north of Karabakh relieved the pressure around the border. Then, from
February this year the Azeris weakened and their foes surged back towards
their eastern border.
Mr Mario Raffaelli, who is acting on behalf of the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), yesterday postponed a visit to the region
after being told of the imminent collapse of Agdam. The CSCE is trying to
broker an agreement between the warring parties in Karabakh.
In both Agdam and Ter-Ter the hard-pressed commanders and administrators
expressed only contempt for the lack of support they are receiving from
Baku.
Mr Ali Asadov, one of the leaders of the 2,000-strong population left in
Agdam, spent Sunday night and yesterday morning driving to and from a base
near Agdam to bring up shells to continue the struggle.
'The politicians in Baku, whoever they are, only fight among themselves for
the chairs that will make them rich. We are alone here and will fall here
with the town,' he said.
On the road leading out of Agdam the refugees, mostly women, children and
old men, camp under army tents or makeshift shelters from hay bales. The
United Nations in Baku estimates that 40,000-50,000 refugees have been
displaced by the fighting around the town.
The authorities in Ter-Ter said yesterday that about 24,000 people had
recently passed through the town or were still living there.

Georgia yesterday shrugged off Russian threats of sanctions, aimed at
imposing a peace settlement on it and its separatist region of Abkhazia, as
it emerged that Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, was almost
killed on Sunday, writes Leyla Boulton.
An aide said a shell narrowly missed Mr Shevardnadze's car as he was driving
through the war-torn province, where hundreds of people have died in almost
a year of fighting.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned on Sunday that
Russia would take harsh measures unless the two sides signed a peace
agreement within two days.
However, a spokesman for the Georgian Foreign Ministry said sanctions would
make no difference as the republic was 'under an economic blockade from
Russia anyway'.

The Bank of Portugal yesterday cut its money market intervention rates by

cent for short-term lending, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Economists expect money rates to fall below 10 per cent by the end of the
year providing the escudo remains stable and the government achieves its
target of reducing the inflation rate to 5-7 per cent this year from 8.9 per
cent in 1992.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Europe closer on acid rain problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A compromise is emerging between European countries seeking a timetable to
reduce emissions from power stations which cause acid rain, write David
Lascelles and Bronwen Maddox. The new targets could be agreed at a meeting
of the Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva next month.
The deal would bridge the gap between countries such as Germany and Norway
which favour tough targets and those wanting more leeway on timing, like the
UK.
Including countries from east and west, it is expected to lay the basis for
new emission standards for power stations in the European Community next
year. It would aim at reducing sulphur emissions by up to 90 per cent by the
year 2005.
The reductions would be based on the 'critical load' approach, which takes
account of an area's ability to withstand acid rain.

FT  06 JUL 93 / French franc slips against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH franc continued to weaken against the D-Mark inside the European
exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers suggested that signs of
weakness in the economy were putting pressure on the Bank of France to cut
interest rates, writes James Blitz.
It closed at FFr3.386, having been at FFr3.383 in London on Friday night.
Last night's close left it some 2 centimes weaker against the D-Mark than it
had been a week ago. Against its ERM divergence indicator, the franc closed
at minus 61 percentage points.
Dealers said a spate of poor economic indicators, last week's unemployment
figures among them, had made an interest rate cut even more urgent. Although
the Bundesbank reduced its official interest rates by half a percentage
point last week, some saw this yesterday as insufficient for France's
economic needs.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Van Miert says subsidies threaten single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community risks embarking on a damaging race to subsidise
state-owned industries which could endanger the single market, Mr Karel Van
Miert, the EC's competition commissioner, said yesterday.
The reluctance of Italy and Spain to co-operate with the European Commission
on restructuring their steel industries was likely to force postponement of
a crucial ministerial meeting later this month, he said.
The meeting, set for July 26, was due to discuss the politically sensitive
question of state aid and capacity cuts in the Italian, Spanish and east
German steel industries. Agreement then would have laid the ground for an
accord this autumn on restructuring the whole EC industry.
Mr Van Miert said: 'Private enterprises are making a salutary effort (to
fall in with Commission plans), but state enterprises are ready to use aid
without making a positive contribution by reducing their capacity.' He
added: 'Members are not only disregarding the rules of the game, they
increasingly don't accept them.'
In particular, state-owned steelmakers were refusing to make drastic
capacity cuts as the price for state subsidies.
Speaking in Bonn, Mr Van Miert indicated that the overall steel
restructuring plan would be at risk if member states did not co-operate. 'In
the steel sector, it has become clear that we do not have enough power at
our disposal to carry out our policies,' he said.
The success of the overall plan has always depended on the fragile goodwill
of steelmakers and politicians, who must co-operate to cut capacity and
reduce state aids.
Commission officials said yesterday that Italy was particularly reluctant to
adapt to Brussels' demands that Ilva, the state-owned steel group, make 3m
tonnes of capacity cuts. They indicated that Brussels would try to find
other ways to force Ilva into line.
The EC steel industry has been hit by recession, overcapacity, and an influx
of cheap steel imports from eastern Europe. The Commission has insisted that
the industry comes up with a viable restructuring plan by October.

FT  06 JUL 93 / EC goes to court over trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY and the Netherlands are to be taken to the European Court for
defying European Commission efforts to forge a unified trade policy toward
cheap imports from China and former Communist countries.
The Commission wants to abolish - or harmonise - national quotas on imports
in order to impose an EC-wide quota to match the single European market.
These national quotas number around 6,500, with many dating back to the
second world war.
The court action is the latest incident pitting a free-trade minded Bonn
government against the Commission and the majority of the country's EC
partners:
Last week Germany lost an appeal to the European Court against a new EC
banana regime which discriminates against high-quality bananas from Latin
America in favour of Caribbean and African producers.
Last month an EC-German row erupted over Bonn's refusal to apply token trade
sanctions against the US on telecommunications. The Germans cited a 1954
non-aggression pact with the US on trade sanctions, and the issue remains
unresolved.
Last December EC foreign ministers were supposed to agree to liberalise
quotas, but failed because the issue was linked to a proposal to strengthen
the use of EC trade weapons such as anti-dumping.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Irish talk tough but look for development aid deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government is ostensibly digging in its heels, in its fight to win
IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) from the European Community regional development
programme for 1994-1999. However, it is also quietly softening up public
opinion for a possible compromise.
Mr Dick Spring, foreign minister, blocked a deal at the weekend on the
share-out of the programme's Ecu157bn (Pounds 121.4bn) package, after he had
been offered only IPounds 7.5bn at an EC foreign ministers' meeting.
The Dublin government insists it had oral assurances from the European
Commission, at the Edinburgh summit last December, that Ireland's percentage
of the 1994-1999 programme would remain as it was during the 1989-1993
programme.
On returning from that summit, Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, had told
the Dail (parliament): 'The agreement now reached ensures, and I say this
with complete confidence, that Ireland will obtain in excess of IPounds 8bn
over seven years. This will comprise up to IPounds 1bn from the new cohesion
fund and more than IPounds 7bn from the structural funds.'
After the devaluation of the Irish punt in January, he said the total he had
been promised would be worth some IPounds 8.6bn.
Having laid his political reputation on the line, despite having received no
written assurances in Edinburgh, Mr Reynolds has been caught in the
embarrassing situation of either having to compromise and face criticism at
home, or be seen in Brussels as the principal obstacle to the biggest
package of regional aid to be disbursed to the EC's disadvantages areas.
Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael, said yesterday that Mr
Reynolds should settle for nothing but the IPounds 8bn 'he promised, or was
promised by an EC official'.
At the weekend, Mr Reynolds insisted that he would not 'sell out' Ireland's
interests, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that 'our target
remains not less than IPounds 8bn'. However, the latter said: 'It is a
matter of serious national concern and we will fight as hard as we can for
the maximum. But we are in a negotiating stance. There is room for manoeuvre
and space between the two figures.'
In London, the prime minister's office yesterday welcomed an outline EC
agreement on aid worth Pounds 2.3bn for depressed UK areas, but refused to
say how Britain would interpret the rules on matching EC funds with aid from
local or national government.
Past UK Treasury attempts to curb its spending on regions benefiting from EC
assistance have led to clashes with Brussels, and to rows between UK
government departments and in parliament.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Kohl acts to fill the breach: Seiters resignation is severe
blow to Chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE resignation of Mr Rudolf Seiters, the German interior minister, over a
bungled anti-terrorist operation, is potentially the most damaging blow in
recent months to the political credibility of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The latter moved rapidly yesterday to appoint the relatively unknown Mr
Manfred Kanther, leader of his Christian Democratic Union in the state of
Hesse, to take over the portfolio. He then flew off to Tokyo to attend the
Group of Seven economic summit.
Back in Bonn, however, the impression remains that Mr Seiters' resignation
has robbed Mr Kohl of one of his closest associates in the coalition
government simply because he had lost the political will to fight for his
job.
'Mr Seiters is like a captain who leaves his ship before it has even begun
to sink,' said Mr Willi Steul, political commentator for Sudwestfunk, the
south-western broadcasting organisation. 'It is not even clear what went
wrong with the operation, and yet he has resigned.'
His decision to quit, against Mr Kohl's pleading, followed a series of
conflicting reports from different security agencies about a shoot-out with
suspected members of the Red Army Faction terrorist group a week ago. A
suspected terrorist and a policeman in the elite GSG-9 anti-terrorist group
were shot dead.
A new report from the federal crime office yesterday failed to cast any new
light on the death of Mr Wolfgang Grams, the suspected terrorist, to counter
allegations that he was executed in cold blood at the end of the shoot-out.
Mr Kanther, a long-time associate of Mr Kohl, but without any profile in
national politics, promised yesterday that clarification of the shooting
would be his top priority.
Yet the very fact that the anti-terrorist operation at Bad Kleinen, near
Schwerin in eastern Germany, is still shrouded in mystery, has caused more
speculation about Mr Seiters' decision to quit the government, and
strengthened suspicions of rough justice.
It has also reinforced demands for the resignation of Mr Alexander von
Stahl, the federal prosecutor, and for the GSG-9 unit to be disbanded.
'He simply did not have the stomach for a fight with the media,' according
to one senior government official yesterday. 'He is a very honourable, and a
very sensitive man.'
He is the ninth minister to leave the cabinet in a resignation or forced
retirement over the past 18 months, and the fifth to resign because of a
scandal. In this case, however, Mr Seiters made clear he was taking
political responsibility for possible mistakes committed by units under his
command.
Close political allies suggested yesterday that he was exhausted by the
in-fighting in the governing coalition, and by the prospect of a long
drawn-out inquiry into the operation.
The issues of law and order, and immigration, over which the Interior
Ministry presides, are also likely to be the most politically charged in
next year's election campaign. Some observers believe Mr Seiters was
concerned at the conservative drift of the policies of Mr Kohl and the
Christian Democratic Union.

Poland brought in value added tax yesterday, set generally at 22 per cent
but with a 7 per cent rate for items such as childrens' goods and
construction materials, and a zero rating for basic food items, writes
Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw.
The government expects VAT, which replaces a turnover tax, to add only 1.5
percentage points to the annual inflation rate.
The tax rises will be phased in as old VAT-free stocks are replaced. In a
last-minute rush to avoid price rises, Poles have been on a shopping spree.
Cars and lorries have also blocked border crossings with Germany in a
scramble to import goods before the tax took effect.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Gonzalez gets unions on side: Two main labour organisations
agree to start pay pact talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, yesterday won agreement from the
country's two leading unions - the Socialist UGT and the Communist
Comisiones Obreras - to start talks on a long-term wages pact. Both unions
have in the past been extremely critical of the government's liberal
economic policies.
He spent nearly two hours with the unions' leaders, Mr Nicolas Redondo and
Mr Antonio Gutierrez and, in what may presage a new rapprochement, he
promised not to toughen a controversial strike law whose passage through
parliament was blocked by his decision to call last month's general
election.
Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party won the election but lost its majority in
parliament.
In order to signal to foreign investors that the new government is serious
about lowering inflation and reducing public sector deficits, he has had to
move quickly to get the unions and employers around a negotiating table. As
imports fall, wage increases of more than 7 per cent this year are now
assumed to be the most important cause of inflation.
By offering to allow the strike legislation to pass into law untouched, the
prime minister is giving the unions what they want. Employers earlier this
year denounced the draft law as a 'striker's charter' for the powers it
gives pickets.
The carrot being dangled in front of the employers is far-reaching reform of
the labour market, with the unspoken promise that negotiations will result
in laws that make it easier and cheaper to sack workers. Mr Gonzalez also
met employers yesterday.
Figures showing the Spanish economy in a much sharper recession than had
been feared - gross domestic product shrank by 1.1 per cent in the first
quarter - have added to the sense of urgency Mr Gonzalez is keen to give to
the 'social pact' talks and to the work that has already begun on producing
a restrictive budget for 1994.
The budget has to be presented in September and many analysts believe the
short-term fate of the peseta depends on the depth of public spending cuts.
Mr Gonzalez is also scrambling to put a government together before the
August summer holiday, but both the leading Catalan and Basque regional
parties are reluctant (in varying degrees) to join a coalition.
He is toying with naming a provisional minority government until the
Catalans feel the right fiscal and federal policies are in place for them to
join. But analysts warn that Mr Gonzalez can ill afford to begin this
administration with anything smacking of the provisional. His failure to
name a new cabinet for 16 months after winning the 1989 election crippled
policy-making for almost all of his third term.

GEORGIA yesterday shrugged off Russian threats of sanctions, aimed at

An aide said a shell narrowly missed Mr Shevardnadze's car as he was driving

The Abkhaz parliament said heavy fighting was raging yesterday after an
offensive on the regional capital, Sukhumi, which is in government hands,
was repulsed.
Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi claimed yesterday that President
Boris Yeltsin's home region had declared itself a republic, as part of a
plot sanctioned by the Russian leader.
The latest broadside against Mr Yeltsin, who has not commented on the
proclamation of a Urals republic within Russia, came as Mr Sergei Shakhrai,
deputy prime minister, warned the declaration could upset attempts to hammer
out a new constitution.

The Commission wants to abolish - or harmonise - national quotas on imports
in order to impose an EC-wide quota to match the single European market.
These national quotas number around 6,500, with many dating back to the
second world war.
The court action is the latest incident pitting a free-trade minded Bonn
government against the Commission and the majority of the country's EC
partners:
Last week, Germany lost an appeal to the European Court against a new EC
banana regime which discriminates against high-quality bananas from Latin
America in favour of Caribbean and African producers.
Last month, an EC-German row erupted over Bonn's refusal to apply token
trade sanctions against the US on telecommunications. The Germans cited a
1954 non-aggression pact with the US on trade sanctions, and the issue
remains unresolved.
As in the telecommunications dispute, the Germans and Dutch appear to have
the law on their side; but only at the expense of political solidarity
within the Community.
Last December, EC foreign ministers were supposed to agree to liberalise
quotas, but failed because the issue was linked to a proposal to strengthen
the use of EC trade weapons such as anti-dumping.
The British, Dutch, and Germans all opposed strengthening the Commission's
powers.
The Germans and Dutch argued that the lack of a council of ministers
decision meant that all national quotas were eliminated and all import
restrictions lifted. The Commission said this was premature, but it was
prepared to discuss temporary authorisation.
Britain has sent in a list of quotas it plans to apply, and so has avoided
court action. 'Germany,' said an EC diplomat, 'is becoming less reticent in
defending what it sees as its national interest.'

FT  06 JUL 93 / Europe moves closer on acid rain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPROMISE is emerging between European countries seeking a timetable to
reduce emissions from power stations which cause acid rain.
The new targets could be agreed at a meeting of the Economic Commission for
Europe in Geneva next month. The deal would bridge the gap between countries
such as Germany and Norway which favour tough targets and those wanting more
leeway on timing, like the UK.
Britain's resistance to the toughest standards has risked undermining some
of its recently-improved reputation for addressing the acid rain problem.
Sulphur emissions were one of the main reasons Britain was christened the
'dirty man of Europe' years ago, a tag it has found difficult to shake off.
The ECE deal, including countries from east and west, is expected to lay the
basis for new emission standards for power stations in the European
Community next year.
The compromise will aim at reducing sulphur emissions by up to 90 per cent
by the year 2005. This is being proposed to bridge the gap between the year
2000 being sought by countries seeking to accelerate the clean-up and the
2010 target preferred by those, particularly in east Europe, with a long way
to go.
The reductions would be based on the 'critical load' approach, which takes
account of an area's ability to withstand acid rain.
The UK's position is diplomatically sensitive because its large coal-fired
power stations have been blamed for causing acid rain in many continental
countries and Scandinavia. Britain did not subscribe to an earlier ECE
agreement to cut sulphur emissions by 30 per cent, though in the event it
met the target.
This time, the UK is still resisting a tough timetable, and proposes to
support the 2005 target compromise. Only two British power stations are
being fitted with equipment to remove sulphur from the exhaust gases, and
power companies are fighting pressure to fit any more because of the high
cost. Instead, the UK intends to switch to cleaner fuels such as natural gas
or low sulphur coal.
The new ECE agreement will provide the background to the EC's review of the
large combustion plants directive next year. This already lays down emission
reduction targets for power stations, but these were always due to be
tightened in 1994. Members states may therefore keep something in reserve
when negotiating in Geneva next month.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Italian pay accord prompts cut in interest rates: But the
country still has the most rigid labour system within the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy yesterday cut its discount rate by a full percentage point
to 9 per cent, the lowest level since 1976.
The cut, effective from today, follows the four-year pact agreed on Saturday
between employers and trade unions on wages and working conditions.
The agreement also enabled Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, to
leave for the Tokyo G7 summit with clear evidence of his government's
determination to hold down inflation and tackle the public sector deficit.
Mr Ciampi had set Saturday as the deadline for Confindustria, the
industrialists' confederation, and the three trade union confederations to
resolve the issue.
The agreement is Mr Ciampi's first important achievement since taking office
two months ago. Nevertheless, the outcome still leaves Italy with the most
rigid labour system in the EC.
The wage element in Italy's high labour costs may now tend downwards but
other aspects (such as social security, pensions and job security) are
scarcely affected.
However, the deal is a compromise with many unresolved aspects. The most
important is how to tackle employers' demands to avoid matching a rise in
social security contributions on wage increase above the national minimum.
This issue had been one of the sticking points in the talks and had to be
left out of the agreement.
As a result, the agreement will not be signed until July 22. This will give
Mr Ciampi time to produce a proposal, probably based on offering tax
concessions against the extra cost of social security contributions.
The union leadership will also have time to test the reaction of its
members, who could be hostile. Many view the concessions which have been
made as a further erosion of union bargaining power.
Within the framework of a four-year pact, the trade union leadership has
accepted that wages cannot match inflation and that increases must be linked
to productivity.
This endorses the parlous state of Italy's public finances and company
profitability. In the current recession generous (and inflationary) wage
settlements are out of the question.
Another union concession has been to drop opposition to the principle of
temporary employment and lower starting salaries.
Acceptance of lower starting salaries is the first step towards breaking
down labour rigidities.
However, temporary employment is scarcely a breakthrough because the
agreement is surrounded by many caveats and much potential bureaucracy.
In return for union concessions, the government has agreed to speed benefits
applied to workers who are temporarily laid off and to extend lay-off
payments to small companies.
Until now, only employees in large companies have benefited.
Despite ultimatums, the employers did not wish to be viewed as responsible
for sabotaging the agreement and undermining the stability of the Ciampi
government.
They have achieved considerably less than they need to modernise industrial
relations and they have lost their argument to deal with the unions at one
level - local or national.
But in return the centralised hegemony of the three trade union
confederations has been weakened in favour of greater local initiative, and
individual works councils will have greater autonomy.
These changes should speed a shake-up of the confederations which evolved
reflecting the Cold war divisions - the former communist dominated CGIL, the
Christian Democrat CISL and the Socialist UIL.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Defeat in Lords threatens sell-off of BR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMBARRASSING defeat for the government in the House of Lords on a central
part of plans to privatise British Rail last night threatened to throw the
future of the sell-off into doubt.
In a fresh jolt to the administration of Mr John Major, rebel Tory peers
joined with opposition parties to vote to allow BR to bid to run rail
service franchises after privatisation.
The government now faces the risk that a rebellion by Tory MPs, many of whom
are already worried about the sale, will prevent it from overturning the
defeat.
Transport ministers had admitted that the change would amount to a 'wrecking
amendment' and went to the heart of the privatisation proposals. If BR were
allowed to bid for franchises it would, in effect, turn the sale into an
exercise in compulsory competitive tendering.
Labour and Liberal Democrats hailed the defeat as a humiliating blow to the
privatisation plans.
Last night, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said that he would
look again at the proposals before the bill returns to the Commons in the
autumn. He made it clear, however, that he would take a lot of convincing
that the government's original plans had been wrong.
Sir Keith Speed, who led the Tory rebels when MPs last considered the
legislation, urged ministers to accept the Lords' decision, and warned that
the result would be 'a close-run thing' if they tried to overturn the
defeat.
Ministers may be driven to seek some compromise if there seems a serious
risk that the Lords' decision would be approved by MPs, in order to avoid
the worst outcome of being stuck with the amendment after a second defeat.
The change imposed by the Lords so undermines the bill, however, that the
government is certain to try to reject it.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport secretary, said the rail sell-off had
been 'torpedoed', and promised a hard summer's campaigning to prevent
ministers from reversing the Lords' move.
The defeat was a further setback for Mr Major as he tries to restore
stability to the government after a bruising year in which he has been
buffeted by Tory revolts. In May, he faced rebellions by Tory MPs over BR
privatisation - including one on the issue on which the government was
defeated yesterday.
Then the legislation only survived intact after Mr MacGregor made
concessions which included an assurance that more emphasis would be put on
motivating BR managers who remain in the public sector.
Mr MacGregor has argued that to allow BR to bid to run services would be to
undermine the main objective of privatisation - to transfer operation to the
private sector. He has emphasised the financial help that the government
would give to BR managers to launch management buyouts.
The Lords approved by 150 to 112 an amendment proposed by Lord Peyton of
Yeovil, a former Tory transport minister, during the Railways Bill's
committee stage. Lord Peyton predicted that BR's expertise would be missed
and those who prevented it from bidding would ultimately face censure.
Earlier, BR took encouragement from a comment by Lord Caithness, government
spokesman in the Lords, that if BR joined a junior partner in a private
consortium bidding for passenger franchises, this would be permissible.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Publicity led to break-up of GEC talks with BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between GEC and British Aerospace on combining defence interests were
called off by BAe at the weekend because of press publicity, it emerged
yesterday.
A joint statement said 'discussions on fuller collaboration have ceased'.
However, neither company ruled out the possibility of talks being resumed.
The Ministry of Defence, which has occasionally opposed GEC's expansion,
said yesterday it was unlikely to object to a deal. Its main concern was to
avoid dependence on foreign suppliers for significant equipment. One
official said it was principally a matter for the Department of Trade and
Industry. Both companies had dismissed as 'speculation' a Sunday Times story
which said BAe and GEC were merging their defence interests. Behind
yesterday's short statement lay disagreement on how far the confidential
talks had progressed.
BAe said talks had been going on since the company was privatised in 1985.
'This certainly wasn't the first time, and it probably won't be the last,'
the company said. It played down the significance of the talks, saying they
had 'not moved perceptibly for weeks'. The fact of their disclosure had put
BAe in 'a messy situation'.
BAe restructuring, including the sale of several businesses, meant a deal
with GEC was not in shareholders' interests at present. Lord Weinstock,
GEC's managing director, has made no secret of his desire to do a deal.
GEC attacked the weekend coverage as irresponsible and destructive. It added
'the important thing for our defence industry is our relationship with BAe'.
Neither company would comment on the nature of the deal which had been
discussed. However, it is believed to have involved putting all or part of
their defence interests into a joint venture similar to that which GEC has
with Alsthom of France in power generation.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Defence cuts fall hardest on navy and air force: Pounds 500m
air defence missile plan shelved - Tornado squadron to disband
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROAD-RANGING cuts in war-ships, submarines and fighters and the
cancellation of two weapons projects were announced by the government
yesterday on publication of its annual defence white paper.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announced that Britain was shelving a
Pounds 500m-plus plan for a new air defence missile system. British
Aerospace had been bidding with Raytheon of the US, maker of the Patriot
missile, for the contract against other international consortia.
The UK is also following the US and Germany in withdrawing from a new
anti-tank weapon to be fired from multiple rocket launchers. Mr Rifkind said
the job could be done by aircraft.
He confirmed that the navy would try to sell or lease its four new Upholder
class conventionally powered submarines, which have cost more than Pounds
200m each. Work on the last vessel at Cammell Laird is almost complete.
Alternatively the submarines may be placed in storage. The fleet of frigates
and destroyers is to be cut from 39 to 'about 35'.
An RAF Tornado fighter squadron now patrolling Bosnian airspace from a base
in Italy will be disbanded next April, bringing to 15 the number of
squadrons cut since the government announced its Options for Change
programme three years ago.
Mr Rifkind said the measures reflected the decreasing likelihood of a
serious external threat. Amid Tory backbench warnings that cuts should go no
further, he insisted that Britain's forces were sufficient to carry out all
the tasks required of them.
'There is a clear operational justification for each of these reductions,
which otherwise would not have been agreed,' he told the Commons.
Other long-awaited measures, including the expected abandonment of plans for
an air-launched nuclear missile, were put off, opening the the way to Labour
attacks of 'indecision'.
Mr Rifkind described the cuts as 'modest, but significant'. Despite 'lurid
headlines', he said, spending targets remained the same as agreed with the
Treasury last November, when plans over the next two years were reduced by
Pounds 1.05bn.
Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the Transport and General Workers'
Union, said the measures would accelerate job losses, and warned of a 'tide
of redundancies' in the defence industry in the next six months.
However, Mr Rifkind said reductions were offset by enhancements including
plans to buy 'a substantial number' of support helicopters. He announced a
Pounds 75m order for over 400 ammunition-supply vehicles from Cheshire-based
Foden.
He said the four-nation Eurofighter was 'secure'. Figures published
yesterday showed the UK share of Eurofighter development costs at Pounds
3.46bn against Pounds 2.72bn a year ago.
The army, the focus of recent controversy about the size of cuts, is the
service least affected by the measures. Mr Rifkind said there were no plans
for further reductions in armoured regiments, which would stay at eight. The
government had still to decide whether to upgrade existing tanks or buy more
Vickers Challenger 2s.
The white paper confirmed navy personnel would be cut to 52,500 by 1995,
instead of 55,000 foreseen two years ago. Further reductions are due after
that.

FT  06 JUL 93 / Lloyd's leadership faced with challenge over business plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S leadership faced a fresh challenge yesterday from rebel members of
the insurance market who won the first stage in a battle to overhaul its new
business plan.
An extraordinary general meeting of the market agreed to ballot Names - the
wealthy individuals whose capital underwrites the market - on a resolution
demanding a vote on changes to the plan.
Rebel Names drew up the resolution demanding that the plan, designed to
revitalise Lloyd's after recent heavy losses, should receive two-thirds
support in order to be implemented. It also seeks compensation for Names who
have suffered financial hardship.
Under the plan, announced two months ago, market costs would be cut and
Lloyd's would be opened to corporate as well as individual Names to attract
capital, possibly under conditions of limited liability. The rebels fear
this could put existing Names, who have unlimited liability, at a severe
disadvantage.
A second resolution, proposed by Mr Claud Gurney, leader of the rebel
faction, calls on the leadership to accept a 'duty of care'. If accepted,
this could give extra impetus to attempts by Names to sue their agents and
Lloyd's leadership for alleged mismanagement.
The Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest Names organisation,
yesterday submitted a third resolution, calling on Names to back the
leadership and its business plan.
The result of the postal ballot on the resolutions, open to all Names, is
expected on August 10.
An attempt by rebel Names to seek an overhaul of Lloyd's council through a
postal ballot last year, the first such ballot held at Lloyd's, failed
because it did not win the necessary 50 per cent support of those voting.
Lloyd's leadership could take some comfort from the fact that yesterday's
extraordinary general meeting, though occasionally heated, was attended by
only about 600 external members. This compared with about 2,500 who turned
up for an extraordinary general meeting ahead of last year's postal ballot.
Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said he welcomed fresh input
into the business plan, but stressed the leadership needed members' support.
'We don't have time. We need to get on with the job,' he said.
Mr Gurney said he was confident the resolutions would be passed after a year
of mounting losses that left growing numbers of Names joining action groups.

FT  06 JUL 93 / 'Wise men' forecast growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK has the potential for a period of relatively high growth without
undue inflation, the Treasury's panel of outside forecasters said yesterday.
Four of the seven advisers also called for tough action to bring down the
large gap between government spending and receipts, beyond the rises in
taxation announced for next April.
Together with economic figures issued yesterday, the first report from the
'seven wise men' to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, supported notions
that a sustainable upturn may be on its way although it warned that in the
short term the recovery could be 'slow and patchy'.

TANDEM Computers' third-quarter results will be below plan as well as below

Reuter reports from Cupertino. The company also said it would announce
details of a restructuring designed to reduce costs when it releases
quarterly results on July 28.
Tandem attributed its disappointing third-quarter results in part to a
slowdown in orders due to customers waiting for a major product announcement
from the company in the next few weeks.
'With this new product announcement, Tandem will become the price
performance leader in high availability online transaction processing
systems and servers,' the company said.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Wimpey to face green roof task
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A dramatic underground multi-purpose hall, topped with turf and shrubs,
forms part of two design and build contracts for Netherhall Education
Association won by Wimpey Construction London.
The schemes, worth a total of Pounds 5.3m, are to develop and refurbish a
students' hall of residence and a catering training centre in Hampstead,
north London.
They also involve the demolition of three buildings, and replacing them with
two hostels and seminar centres, together with a new teaching wing.
Extensions will be added to two existing buildings, Lakefield Centre and
Netherhall House.
Several unusual features have been required because the college is sited in
a conservation area. By far the most distinctive is the location of a
multi-purpose hall, which will be built underground and topped with a
landscaped 'green roof'.
That will involve excavating some 2,000 cubic metres of earth to house the
two storey building.
The new work will also blend in with existing premises as a result of
careful selection of materials. Original features of a Victorian building,
such as the roof finials and facing decorative brick work, will be
replicated and used in construction of the new premises.
When fully operational by the end of 1994, Wimpey will have rebuilt or
refurbished about 5,000 sq metres of the colleges.
The contracts will finish in two stages with the chief construction work
completed in time for occupation next summer.
The second phase, the refurbishment part of the contract, will be ready by
Christmas 1994.

FT  05 JUL 93 / People: Economists at Shell and BA from the distaff side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are even fewer female economists at the top of big business than there
are female politicians in top positions of government, so the probability
that Shell International's outgoing chief economist, DeAnne Julius, would be
replaced by another female of the species might seem pretty slim.
However, DeAnne Julius, a 44-year-old American who has done the job for four
years, helped draw up the short list of candidates to succeed her, and
ensured that the name of Heidemarie Sherman of the Institut fur
Wirtschaftsforschung in Munich, was included.
The two of them had co-authored a book together, the Monetary Implications
of 1992, when Julius was director of economics at Chatham House.
Julius, a former World Bank economist who is married to Ian Harvey, chief
executive of the British Technology Group, is expected to join British
Airways in September. The airline has plenty of economists but it is
understood that Julius will be taking on a newly created post of chief
economist.
She sees plenty of similarities between Shell and BA. They are both in
long-term capital intensive industries and have an important interface with
governments. In addition, both companies face competition from state-owned
rivals.
However, BA is a much smaller company than Shell and Julius says that one of
the attractions of her new job is that she will be much closer to the
business. She will report to Roger Maynard, BA's director of corporate
strategy. There is far more to running an airline than picking the fastest
growing routes and negotiating cosy deals, says Julius. She is particularly
looking forward to being involved in the airline business at a time when the
European industry is undergoing big structural shifts.
Sherman is the latest in a long line of well regarded outside economists to
occupy the chief economist's slot. It is one of the very few positions at
Shell where the company brings in outsiders for relatively brief periods.
Oxford University's Peter Oppenheimer did the job for a couple of years and
the World Bank has often provided candidates.

FT  05 JUL 93 / VW squeezes out vice-chairman in reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DANIEL Goeudevert has been squeezed out of his post as vice-chairman of
the Volkswagen group as a result of a 'structural reorganisation', VW said
at the weekend.
He will leave at the end of July by 'mutual agreement'. His main duties,
responsibility for the VW brand - accounting for two-thirds of group sales -
will be taken on by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman.
Only four of the 10 management directors who were on the board at the time
of Mr Piech's appointment are still in their former positions, but Mr
Goeudevert will continue as a consultant.
Once favourite to become group chairman, he lost to Mr Piech in last
autumn's selection, when the scale of the group's crisis was becoming clear.
Since then he has increasingly appeared the odd man out, especially
following the arrival in March of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as
group production and procurement director.
This further eroded his operational role, leaving him basically in charge of
marketing the VW marque, while Mr Lopez was adopted as the chairman's
closest confidant.
Mr Goeudevert's intellectual approach set him further apart from the
engineering duo committed to rescuing Germany's biggest volume car
manufacturer.
He was also tainted by Mr Piech's accusation that the former group board had
failed to do its 'homework' during the eight prosperous years, before VW was
overtaken by recession in the second half of 1992.
After a DM1.25bn (Dollars 737m) loss in the first quarter of this year, the
group is heading rapidly back into the black, according to Mr Piech.
While markets languish in recession, most of the progress in cutting losses
is being made through large-scale labour cuts and pressure on components
suppliers for rapid cuts in parts prices.
Mr Lopez, who was brought in from General Motors to cut VW's procurement and
manufacturing costs, was accused at the weekend of driving Giesserei
Mittelmann, a metalworking company, into bankruptcy.
'We are Lopez's first victim,' a lawyer acting for the company said. A
Mittelmann official said that having already agreed to reduce prices by 7
per cent, he received last month a demand for further cuts from the start of
1994. A VW manager reportedly told him that unless he agreed to reductions
of 28 per cent on products accounting for a third of Mittelmann's sales, the
contract would go to Spain.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Labour talks fail at Hyundai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BREAKDOWN in labour negotiations is threatening to cause widespread
industrial action at Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate.
Hyundai estimates that it has already suffered 262bn won (Dollars 330m) in
lost sales since May, due to labour strife affecting Hyundai Motor, the
largest automaker in South Korea, and Hyundai Precision, a container and
jeep manufacturer.
South Korean President Kim Young-Sam has warned that he may be forced to
make a 'grave' decision concerning the labour unrest at Hyundai if it
threatens to damage the nation's economic recovery.
The government has blamed the job action at Hyundai for a meagre 3.2 per
cent rise in exports last month. Vehicles and containers are among Korea's
leading export items.
Workers at five Hyundai companies, including Hyundai Motor, have already
staged partial walk-outs.
The unions at four other Hyundai subsidiaries, including Hyundai Heavy
Industries and Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, have voted to strike on Wednesday
unless their demands for considerable wage rises, averaging 16 per cent, are
met.
Hyundai estimates it could lose 158bn won from a two-week strike at Hyundai
Heavy Industries, the nation's biggest shipbuilder.
The Hyundai trade unions are among the most militant and well-organised in
South Korea. The concentration of Hyundai manufacturing facilities in the
south-eastern city of Ulsan facilitates collective action among workers.
Prospects for settling the Hyundai labour dispute appeared good last week
when workers at Hyundai Precision, which initiated industrial action within
the industrial group, agreed to return to work. Mr Chung Se-yung, Hyundai
chairman, then proposed to negotiate directly with other Hyundai union
leaders on a final pay deal.
A meeting on Saturday was aborted when the unions insisted on a
comprehensive settlement for all Hyundai companies. Officials wanted to
conclude agreements on an individual company basis, in a bid to weaken the
power of the Hyundai union alliance.
The labour dispute represents a key test for Mr Kim, a former dissident and
the country's first civilian leader in more than three decades.
His implied threat to crack down on labour unrest reverses his government's
recent moves to offer concessions to the union movement.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Kanemaru fires up New Party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KOFU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE man who has pledged to clean up Japanese politics yesterday kicked off
his election campaign in Yamanashi - the old constituency of Mr Shin
Kanemaru, disgraced godfather of the ruling Liberal Democrats (LDP), Reuter
reports from Kofu.
Under a banner reading 'Let's put Japan to rights from Yamanashi', Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New Party, said there could be no
better place to start a clean-up.
'Needless to say we chose Yamanashi to start the campaign because of its
scandalous political climate,' he said in a speech to 2,000 supporters in
Kofu, the prefectural cap-ital.
'This is where the cosy relations between politicians and businessmen are at
their worst.'
Kofu, 100 km west of Tokyo in the shadow of Mount Fuji, radiates the
prosperity of modern Japan. Its wide boulevards are lined with department
stores, gleaming office buildings and trees and shrubs.
However, much of the wealth came from Mr Kanemaru's manipulation of a system
under which politicians used their influence to benefit their most generous
campaign donors. It is a system Mr Hosokawa and a generation of new
politicians say they want to change.
Last week Fair Trade Commission investigators raided the offices of 30
construction companies in Yamanashi.
Experts on corruption said the move only became possible after Mr Kanemaru's
clout over civil servants evaporated following his recent arrest on charges
of massive tax evasion.
Prosecutors said the companies in question extended billions of yen in
questionable donations to Mr Kanemaru. In return, they were believed to have
been shielded from censure by civil servants.
When Japan's national railway wanted to build a track to test a proposed
high-speed supertrain, Mr Kanemaru made sure it came to Yamanashi. Land
prices shot up and made local farmers richer overnight.

FT  05 JUL 93 / French Socialists look to an uncertain future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LYONS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'THE Left lives, and it can win again,' Mr Michel Rocard, the French
Socialist leader, yesterday told cheering delegates at the party's first
conference since its crushing defeat in the March elections.
It was also the first time the Socialists had convened a meeting of their
Etats Generaux, a term from pre-revolutionary France in which citizens met
to present their grievances to the king - in this case, the Socialist
leadership. So great is his distance from the party, and from Mr Rocard,
that the absentee President Francois Mitterrand did not even send the Lyons
gathering a message of support.
But there was little echo of Mr Rocard's pre-election call in February for a
'big bang' recomposition of the French left, with the possibility of the
Socialists merging with environmentalists and moderate Communists in a new
party to confront the massive parliamentary majority behind Mr Edouard
Balladur's government.
One left-wing Socialist leader called on Saturday for a Red-Pink-Green
coalition, but the election has fractured the Greens and given the
Communists enough seats to want to continue on their own.
The Socialists have also ruled out changing their party's name. Ironically,
some of the Lyons delegates, who were not paid up party members but billed
as 'sympathisers', reproached the Socialists for being too timid to emblazon
the Eurexpo conference centre with the party's traditional symbol of a red
rose in a clenched fist.
In his concluding speech, Mr Rocard suggested the Socialists should hold
regular Etats Generaux, acknowledging that in 10 years of power the party
had become cut off from its grass roots and from the French electorate.
Over the three-day convention, the party leadership was accused of ignoring
unemployment, of being arrogant and sometimes corrupt, and of factional
warfare. Mr Rocard himself became the party's provisional head in early
April by ousting Mr Laurent Fabius as party secretary. These two former
prime ministers represent two of the many different 'currents' in the party,
the result of a proportional representation system which was originally
designed to foster pluralism of ideas but which has long since degenerated
into warring clans centred around rival candidates for the presidency.
This proportional system is unique to France, commented Mr Axel Hanisch,
secretary general of European socialist parties, who addly acidly that 'no
one else in Europe wants to copy it'. The powerful socialist federations of
the Nord-Pas de Calais region want to move towards a majority voting system
inside the party, which would at this stage consolidate Mr Rocard's hold on
the party and his chance of being its presidential candidate in 1995. But
such reform, and formal election of a new leadership, will be left to the
party's regular conference in October.
On the key relationship of jobs and trade, Mr Rocard distanced the party
from the overt protectionism that is growing inside the Balladur government.
Mr Rocard urged that Gatt participants should commit themselves to
conventions of the International Labour Organisation, and so raise their
standards. 'We should not stop importing the products of other countries,'
he said. 'Rather, we should export our demands for basic economic and social
rights.'

FT  05 JUL 93 / Search for the party glue: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reform of Italy's electoral law, widely regarded as an essential step to
the salvaging of the political system, has now passed its first hurdles in
the two houses of parliament. Some problems remain; but there is a
reasonable probability that Italy is about to move from a voting system
which has been wholly based on proportional representation, to one which
will be mainly based on first-past-the-post.
The objective of the reformers is to weaken the power of the discredited
political parties. In a voting system which is wholly proportional, the
voters' options (that is, the lists of candidates) are determined by the
parties. They thus control the political system, and become the nexus for a
vast network of patronage. The wholesale corruption rampant in Italy is the
logical end-product.
Unfortunately, there are at least two reasons for doubting whether this
reform will be enough to provide a solution to the problem. First, the new
law still contains a significant element of proportional representation;
three-quarters of the seats will be filled by single-member constituencies,
but one-quarter will be filled by PR.
The ostensible reason for this residual hold-over is to protect the little
parties, which might be wiped out in first-past-the-post voting. But the
most important consequence will be to load the odds critically in favour of
the party system as such, and against the candidacies of independent
politicians.
Considering that one-sixth of all members of parliament are now under some
form of investigation for corruption, it is arguable that political reform
depends on a far-reaching clean-out of the old cast of characters, and their
replacement by new politicians who are untainted either personally or by
association. But the only people who will be penalised by the new law will
be independent candidates, since they cannot benefit from the residual PR
votes.
But the other reason for scepticism is that modern parliamentary democracy
cannot work without organised political parties. The political parties which
have dominated the scene since the second world war may be the source of
Italy's political crisis; but the logical conclusion is not a parliamentary
system which does not depend on political parties (a contradiction in
terms), but one where the parties are reformed and uncontaminated.
Believing in the attainability of this second alternative requires optimism
on a heroic scale. Who will be the politicians in these utopian parties?
Whom will they represent? And what will be their message?
It is questions such as these which are being anxiously addressed by the
French Socialists, in the wake of their comprehensive defeat in the March
general elections. This weekend they have been holding a large-scale
think-in in Lyons; in October they will hold a formal party congress to
adopt new party statutes; and some time later they plan to stage a more
broadly based debate, with potential allies from other parts of the
political spectrum.
They do not yet have answers to the strategic questions listed above. When
Michel Rocard first called for a sweeping rethink of the party's future, he
admitted that the Socialists had lost both their traditional message and
their traditional constituency. He has since publicly confessed that the
government he led in 1988-91 signally failed to provide socialist remedies
for low growth and high unemployment. But he made no suggestion that he
would have better socialist remedies today.
He has implied that the way forward would lie through alliances with
ex-Communists, ecologists, centrists. But so far it seems that electoral
tactics, the rewriting of the party rulebook, and haggling over the party
hierarchy are taking priority over strategy and ideology.
Cynics will jeer that the disarray of the Socialists is merely the
inevitable consequence of the disarray of socialism, four years after the
fall of the Berlin Wall. There is no doubt a good deal in this argument; but
it may be the Socialists' problem is just an early and acute form of a
systemic dilemma facing most political parties in the closing decade of the
20th century. That dilemma is finding the glue to hold the activists
together and attract the voters.
One kind of party is held together by common interests, plus the promise of
patronage after the conquest of power: for example, the interests of
farmers, or the industrial proletariat. Another kind is based on a shared
ideology, like socialism (plus, of course, patronage). Third, there may be a
common enemy, like conservative hostility to socialism, or national
hostility to foreigners, or regional hostility to the centre (plus
patronage). Fourth, there is pure patronage as the only glue; that may
describe the present rationale of most Italian national parties. Fifth,
there is the presidential system, where the party's main organising
principle is to support a charismatic leader (plus patronage); this is
characteristic of the US.
The problem for parliamentary democracy today is that the first two types of
glue have progressively disintegrated: complex societies do not have large
and homogeneous common-interest groups, and no-one is turned on by ideology.
Pure clientelism can work for a while, as in Japan and Italy; but time and
excess cause it to explode. As a result, countries without a presidential
system, may by default find themselves driven into the politics of enmity.
Mr Rocard wants to reinvent socialism; but the real fault-line in European
politics may lie between the regionalists, the nationalists and the
internationalists.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Dreaming of a perfect summit: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daddy, why are the world's leaders going to Prague for an economic summit?'
'It's a tradition - an excuse for a pleasant vacation. The leaders converge
on one of the richest capitals and talk about anything under the sun.
Usually they go to Asia but Prague is now as chic as Beijing.'
'But why is it called an economic summit? Politicians don't have anything to
do with economics - do they?'
'Of course they don't. But when these summits began in the late 1970s - that
would be well over half a century ago - governments intervened in nearly all
aspects of economic life. They also quarrelled a lot about economic issues.
The summits were meant to reduce friction and enhance 'global co-operation'.
'What did they quarrel about most?'
'Trade. I know this sounds crazy but in those days every country used to
impose tariffs (that is, taxes) on imports from trading partners. These were
often very high. They also imposed quotas - a specific limit on the volume
of goods or share of a market that a competitor could have.'
'You mean we would have had to pay extra for our Chinese hover car?'
'Exactly. These restrictions were illogical. Nobody would have dreamed of
imposing them on trade between regions of their own country. In their hearts
the politicians knew they made everybody poorer but, selfishly, they still
put the short-run interests of their own countries first. They were worried
that rising imports would create unemployment.'
'What is that? I know some people get their incomes topped up out of taxes
but unemployment is a contradiction in terms - wages would always fall to
whatever level is needed to employ everybody.'
'They didn't then because people would not accept that the value of
different jobs is always varying. Wages were not allowed to fall because
people thought the world 'owed them' a certain living standard.'
'What else was discussed at these summits?'
'Fiscal policy was always a contentious issue. By the 1980s economists were
agreed that policy lags and the unpredictability of business cycles meant it
was useless to try to fine-tune economies by deliberately running budget
deficits or surpluses. But politicians (especially Americans) still used to
demand that other countries provide a stimulus by loosening fiscal policy.
And most countries routinely spent more than they raised in taxes, thus
shifting financial burdens onto future generations who didn't have a vote.'
'You're joking. That would be unethical. You mean there wasn't a balanced
budget law?'
'Your economic history is lousy. You should know that didn't happen until
the early years of this century. Monetary policy was also a chronic source
of friction. At the summits, politicians were always complaining that
somebody else's interest rates were too high or too low.'
'Now you're really pulling my leg. Governments don't control interest rates.
The creation of money, and the management of its purchasing power, is a
private-sector function.'
'What a parade of ignorance. In the 20th century national institutions
called central banks enjoyed monopoly rights to print money. A few were
nominally independent but most had to obey the politicians who invariably
wanted more rather than less of it. That's why there was so much inflation
in those years - for your information inflation means a steady rise in the
overall level of prices.'
'What a strange idea. You mean your income would have to rise every year
just to keep pace with prices? But since even in those days most countries
had faith in markets, why on earth did they think private agencies were
incapable of managing money creation? Why did they think people would be
more responsible if they wore public-sector hats?
'It's a long story. One worry was that, if a private bank was allowed to
produce its own money, it would overdo it and create terrible inflation.
That was a stupid argument, of course, because nobody would want to hold
money that loses value. As we have discovered in the last few decades of
'free banking', the market monitors the purchasing power of different
private monies closely. As soon as one shows any signs of losing its value,
it is threatened with bankruptcy.'
'You mean like Greenback Inc that had to be taken over by that Korean
company?'
'Yes. But compared with the instability of the 20th century, we've had only
minor hiccoughs with competing private monies. The price level has barely
moved in 30 years. That's hardly surprising; the scientific challenge of
stabilising the purchasing power of money is not really so great. The tough
problem was persuading governments to surrender a power they relished.'
'Wow, those 20th century guys were dumb.'
'They were, but then they never really grasped the character of a market
system. We see it as a spontaneous self-ordering mechanism and let it do
virtually everything for us. But they saw it more like a bit of defective
physical machinery with levers that had to be pulled and pushed. Ironically,
the ex-communists provided the impetus for reform. With the enthusiasm of
the religious convert they pushed for a truly unhampered market system. Once
we got over the shock, we never looked back.'

FT  05 JUL 93 / Monday Interview: Tycoon who's not in the red - Sally Aw
Sian, chairman of Hong Kong media group Sing Tao, talks to Simon Holberton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the claims William Shawcross makes for Mr Rupert Murdoch in his
recent biography of the media tycoon is that Mr Murdoch was the first to
see, and exploit, the potential of the extra-terrestrial satellite for
global media operations.
Mr Murdoch has his difficulties in Hong Kong, where he is attempting to
acquire control of Television Broadcasts, Hong Kong's top local television
station. And, although it is probably true that he was the first English
language media proprietor to use satellite technology, the accolade 'first'
is more appropriately applied to a tough-minded woman in Hong Kong.
Since the late 1960s she has been in international newspaper publishing and,
in 1978, her company was the first to transmit made-up newspaper pages to
printing plants in North America, Europe, and Australasia via satellite. The
language was Chinese and the title of the newspaper Sing Tao.
Miss Sally Aw Sian, 62, then as now, chairman of Sing Tao, one of Hong
Kong's leading listed media groups, is not, however, a person to crow about
her achievements. 'Yes, we were the first to use satellites,' she says; and
that is that.
Miss Aw's venture into the world of transnational publishing was inspired by
an encounter while on holiday in San Francisco in 1968. She was asked on the
streets of the city's Chinatown for news from Hong Kong and China. The
question became the germ of an idea: 'I thought it would be a good idea to
start a paper . . . I was sure that, if we could publish a paper in San
Francisco, there would be a lot of people interested in buying it,' she
says. Bringing the project to fruition was made easier through her
friendships with the owner of a local grocery chain, who offered to display
any paper she chose to produce, and a publisher with the capacity to print a
newspaper.
Initially, the paper was produced in Hong Kong and flongs - made-up stencils
ready for printing - were air freighted to San Francisco. This continued
until 1978, when she moved to satellite transmission. Today Miss Aw's
newspaper is published in nine cities - - six in north America, plus London,
Sydney and Wellington.
Global circulation is 160,000 a day and, in some centres, notably Toronto,
on a good day the paper can run to 70 broadsheet pages. She has also
tailored the content of the newspapers to suit local market conditions and
reader interest. Advertising is local, as is some news. Reports about Hong
Kong and China are transmitted daily from Sing Tao's headquarters in Hong
Kong.
'We made money only after a few years and today it is a profitable paper,'
she says. In 1992, the entire Sing Tao group made a net profit of HKDollars
119.5m (Pounds 10.4m).
For the scatterlings of the Chinese diaspora who want to read daily news in
Chinese, the choice is limited to the overseas edition of the People's
Daily, the Chinese Communist party's main mouthpiece, an assortment of
Taiwan-funded newspapers, and her own. It is little wonder, then, that when
Miss Aw made her first visit to China last November and met Mr Jiang Zemin,
general secretary of the Chinese Communist party, he was most interested in
her overseas publishing.
The Chinese government cares passionately about what the overseas Chinese
think. It puts a lot of effort in to winning their hearts and minds and in
to encouraging them to return to China to invest. So did she not think, last
November, that she was merely being courted by the Chinese leadership for
her support?
'Well, of course,' she says. 'That it is the main point. Otherwise, why
should they welcome me?'
Miss Aw thought she would never go to China. The mainland government had
denounced her late father, Aw Boon Haw - inventor of Tiger Balm ointment and
owner of several newspapers, mainly in Singapore and southern China, before
the 1949 revolution - for his support of the Kuomingtang, the Communists'
rivals for political legitimacy on the mainland. His newspapers supported
the Kuomingtang and so had Miss Aw's.
Then, two years ago, he was 'rehabilitated' and the mainland government
redefined him as 'patriotic'. It also offered to return to Miss Aw all the
property it had confiscated in 1949 from her father, who was one of the
wealthiest overseas Chinese entrepreneurs of that time. This included prime
holdings in Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen and Fuzhou - among south China's
fastest-growing cities - plus a half-completed mansion which her father had
started building in the family's ancestral village of Zhongchuan, in Fujian.
Her father's rehabilitation and the return of his property set the scene for
Miss Aw's visit to Beijing last autumn. The government housed her in the
Diaoyutai state guest house, usually reserved for important foreign
visitors. In a rare honour, she met both Mr Jiang Zemin and Mr Li Peng,
China's prime minister. Significantly, the meetings were publicised on
national television.
Her visit was designed not only for reconciliation but also for deal-making.
While in Beijing, she signed a HKDollars 3m 50-50 joint venture agreement
with the People's Daily to publish jointly a colour magazine, the Singguang
Monthly. Miss Aw says both parties will share editorial control. It will
publish economic and social articles on China and Chinese communities
abroad. Given the involvement of the People's Daily, it is unlikely the
editorial content will challenge Communist party orthodoxies.
Her meetings with top government leaders amounted to an 'official blessing'
for the venture. She is clearly keen on more, and to boost Sing Tao's media
assets on the mainland, an enormous market hungry for information.
One of her subsidiaries, Jademan, owner ofthe Tin Tin Daily, one of Hong
Kong's top three Chinese language newspapers, has just launched the Nanhwa
Jinji Ribao, or South China Economic Daily. It will focus on business in
China and the country's economic development. Initially, it will sell in
Hong Kong and south-east Asia. But, says Miss Aw: 'When the opportunity
arises, we hope we can sell it in China - when, that is, it is acceptable to
them.'
So far, she has committed about HKDollars 250m to business ventures on the
mainland, which underlines her confidence in China's future.
Echoing sentiments often heard in Hong Kong and on the mainland, she
observes about China's economic reforms: 'They are heading in the right
direction as long as they don't go too fast. Russia had political change
before economic change - that's why they have such problems. China has done
it the other way around.
'I don't think they will, or can, return to the past,' she adds.
With the pragmatism typical of the Hong Kong Chinese business community, she
adds: 'The government is changing and they realise that they have to change
their economic thinking. I think there is a great future in China, and I
have every confidence that we can do business there, especially now that a
lot of western people are going to China to do business.'
For Miss Aw, her return to China also meant a chance to finish business left
incomplete in 1949. Before the Communists assumed power in that year, her
father had donated enough money to the Kuomingtang government to build 100
schools and 100 hospitals. 'The money was given, but nothing came of it
because of the civil war,' she says.
She plans to incorporate a foundation in China into which she will place all
property assets the Communist government has returned to her. The foundation
will fund projects in the arts, education and medicine. For her ancestral
village, she plans to complete the mansion her father started before 1949
and turn it over for use as a cultural centre.
Why? 'Well, because my father was a staunch Chinese and very supportive of
China. He felt that, if he earned money from business in China, he might as
well do things to benefit the Chinese people. Now I will just have to do
what I can with the money we have.'

FT  05 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER last week's bout of European rate cuts, the markets will shift their
focus to Tokyo, where the leaders of the seven largest industrialised
nations meet to discuss Gatt and the prospects for boosting world growth,
writes Rachel Johnson.
Currency co-operation, however, is to be off the agenda, as the G7 has
committed itself to seek - yet again at its annual economic summit - to
salvage the seven-year attempt to reach a breakthrough in world trade talks.
While a Gatt agreement would clearly be the best boost to world growth and
employment to which the leaders could aspire, hopes for an agreement have
faded, along with the political popularity of the main players in the UK,
France, Germany and the US. In addition to the recessionary conditions in
the G7 countries, the political vacuum in Japan is also regarded as an
obstacle to a summit success.
Attention will still be paid to the week's regular economic figures. In the
UK, an inquest on the economy will be opened today, as the Treasury's
independent forecasters release their second report; and the credit business
data are set to show a slight slowdown in the rate of bank lending, in spite
of a rise in the annual growth rate of both M0 and M4 in May and June.
Elsewhere, the Bundesbank's activities will provide a focus for speculation
about how much which other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries can
cut their rates even when Germany holds back.
Last Friday, France cut its intervention rate by 0.25 of a point to 6.75 per
cent; traders figure that since the Bundesbank cut by  1/2 point to 6.75 per
cent, France could manage another  1/4 point reduction. Hopes for an early
cut in UK interest rates, however, remain elusive.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: UK investment management - a question of
style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS IT POSSIBLE to identify clear styles among UK investment managers? That
question has preoccupied researchers in the US, where extensive analysis of
managers' styles has allowed clients to identify clear biases in portfolios
that go a long way towards explaining variations in performance.
But can such distinct styles be said to exist in the UK? And if they do,
what are the implications for those who measure performance? After all, if
different styles produce different results at different stages of a market
cycle, is it reasonable or, indeed, productive to compare the results of
managers with vastly different styles?
Instead, it may be far more relevant to compare the results of managers with
similar styles to each other rather than to, say, the FT-A All Share Index
or even the performance of all other fund managers.
These questions have been examined in some detail in research produced by
Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors and by Barra Incorporated, a US-based
investment technology firm.
The research, a jointly-produced paper, looks at the portfolios of UK unit
trusts for which data are readily available. It does not examine investment
styles of institutional managers. Nevertheless, it is likely that similar
styles would emerge if institutional funds were examined as well as retail
funds.
To conduct their analysis, Barra and Wells Fargo Nikko have broken the FT-A
Index into three categories: growth stocks, value-income stocks and small
capitalisation stocks.
The study looked at 77 unit trusts with at least five years of results and
with at least Pounds 100m in assets. Not surprisingly, clear styles emerged
showing a disproportionate exposure to small companies. Small companies by
value are only 5 per cent of the FT-A index. However, growth funds did prove
true to their name in the sense that 37 per cent of assets fell into that
category with 30 per cent of assets categorised as value stock. Value unit
trusts on average had 62 per cent of assets in value stocks but also carried
a hefty 20 per cent waiting in small companies. The so-called balanced funds
showed a distinct tilt towards value stocks and a disproportionate
concentration of about 24 per cent in small company stocks.
The authors of the research, Mr Andrew Rudd, chief executive of Barra, and
Mr Jeffrey Skelton, managing director of Wells Fargo Nikko, suggest that the
mis-labelling of unit trusts may reflect the fact that managers are unaware
of biases which have crept into stock selection.
The research also examines the extent to which individual managers were true
to their style and the percentage of performance which can be explained by
their having stuck to it. The research records significant variations among
managers on this score.
Deviation from a style can lead to outperformance. A manager who has spotted
a turn in the market cycle may have adjusted his portfolio accordingly. Or
he may be somewhat better at stock selection. But too often, the research
shows, those who deviate from their style underperform others with the same
style.
In their paper, Mr Rudd and Mr Skelton note that with this type of analysis
it is possible to discover managers who are particularly good at one style
or another. 'From the history of the value and growth indexes in our sample
period, it is obvious that a manager might outperform the growth style and
still underperform the All Share. Likewise, a manager might have
underperformed the value index and still outperformed the All Share. Rather
than replacing the good growth manager with the poor value manager, the
pension fund should replace the underperforming manager with one with better
prospects against the value style index'.
An effort to select managers in this fashion would doubtless create a new
field of performance measurement in which managers could be measured against
a more precise peer group. Aside from the commercial opportunities this
would create for performance measurement services, it would be interesting
to see just what this sort of scrutiny does for investment styles.

FT  05 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Investors snap-up double-digit Eurolira
coupons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL INVESTORS with a penchant for high-yielding bonds have been piling
into the Eurolira sector of the international bond market recently, eager to
snap-up bonds with double-digit coupons.
The Eurolira sector has experienced quite a change in sentiment in recent
months. When the lira was pulled out of the European exchange rate mechanism
last September, it was devalued by at about 20 per cent against the D-Mark.
Added to this, the almost daily revelations of corruption among politicians
led to considerable political uncertainty and did little to help Italy's
financial markets.
However, the second Danish vote on the Maastricht treaty helped to put the
convergence argument back on track. As the Bundesbank bowed to pressure last
week and lowered its key interest rates, it prompted a wave of interest rate
cuts across much of Europe as well as raising hopes that other countries -
including Italy - would follow suit.
Investor interest in the Eurolira sector has been prompted by two main
factors - the high yield, and the current relative stability of the lira.
'Investors buy this market because this is the highest coupon currency in
Europe,' says Mr Niccolo Nuti, head of capital markets at Credito Italiano
in Milan.
'This is one of the few remaining bond markets where you can get
double-digit coupons,' said one dealer at an Italian bank last week, adding
that the prospect of falling yields was helping to stimulate buying interest
among investors.
Deutsche Bank in London last week lead-managed a successful L200bn, 10-year
deal for Abbey National Treasury Services with a coupon of 10 per cent. Mr
Roger Bates, of Deutsche Bank, said one reason for the deal's success was
the fact that as interest rates in Europe were set to fall, this represented
one of the few remaining opportunities to buy bonds with a double-digit
coupon.
Coupons in the Eurolira sector have been falling since the start of the
year, when investors were able to buy bonds with coupons of 12.75 per cent.
In the wake of the Abbey National deal, the EBRD launched a L200bn,
seven-year deal with a 9.75 per cent coupon.
Admittedly, the lira is not the only high-yielding currency in Europe, but
dealers say the Eurolira sector is regarded as a more liquid market than
other high-yielding currencies, such as the peseta. The biggest issue in
Eurolira is the EIB's L1,000bn benchmark.
Meanwhile, the currency - which came out of the ERM in September and
weakened to around 1,000 to the D-Mark - has been strengthening steadily
again. 'The lira has finally found its equilibrium - it will probably stay
where it is or appreciate slightly against the D-Mark,' says one Eurolira
specialist.
Traditionally, the Eurolira market has appealed to retail investors from the
Benelux countries and Switzerland who want bearer bonds rather than
registered government securities. They would rather buy top-notch paper
denominated in lira for the high coupon and a play on the currency, than
take Italian government risk.
For the borrowers themselves, the reason for tapping the Eurolira sector is
predominantly swap-related. A total of L8,912bn (about Dollars 5.89bn) of
new issues has been launched in the Eurolira sector in the first six months
of 1993, according to figures compiled by Euromoney.
A few borrowers keep the proceeds in lira to fund Italian subsidiaries: for
example, Abbey National borrowed in fixed-rate lira and swapped the proceeds
into floating-rate lira for financing its Italian mortgage subsidiary. But
dealers estimate some 90 per cent of issues are swapped into dollarsor
D-Marks, depending on the swap opportunities, in order to obtain funding at
well below London interbank offered rate.

FT  05 JUL 93 / UK Gilts: Strong pound revives interest rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BETTING in the gilt market that the UK government will cut interest
rates in the foreseeable future strengthened on the back of monetary easing
in Germany and a stronger pound.
Gilt prices recorded another healthy rise over the week, with the gains
especially marked at the short end of the yield curve.
Even though Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, has ruled
out cutting interest rates in the short term, few people in the gilt market
expect him to keep to his word should the next spate of UK economic data
indicate that signs of recovery are weakening.
While today's announcement of the latest figures for consumer credit will
provide some signs of underlying demand in the economy, most of the action
on gilts trading will probably be postponed until next week, when the new
data include figures for last month's inflation and unemployment.
Over the week, 10-year gilts saw a fall in yields of about 7 basis points,
for a yield reduction of a healthy 45 basis points in the past month.
On Friday night, the 8 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2003 was quoted at
102 5/8 , up about half a point on the week, with its yield registering 7.6
per cent.
The gilt market shrugged off the relative lack of success of a Pounds 3.25bn
auction of 10-year bonds, the biggest ever, which attracted generally poor
support from overseas investors. The cover - the ratio of offers to accepted
bids - was only 1.1. This means that with only slightly less bidding not all
the issue would have been sold.
However, a rally in the market later prompted the Bank of England to issue
Pounds 800m of 15-year bonds which attracted some buying interest on
Thursday and Friday. The Bank is also issuing today Pounds 300m of
index-linked bonds, in the form of Pounds 150m of 2.5 per cent stock due
2009 and the same amount of 2.5 per cent bonds maturing in 2024.
The Bank is well advanced with its fund-raising. In the first three months
of the year it has borrowed roughly Pounds 20bn, two-thirds through auctions
and the rest through taps and other gilt sales. This leaves it in a
reasonably good position to borrow the money it needs to fund the expected
Pounds 50bn deficit for 1993-94.
Many in the market take the view that investors, both in the UK and abroad,
are well poised to buy this level of gilts, assuming that little happens to
upset notions that inflation is under control.
Last week's announcement that pay rises in manufacturing in the three months
to the end of April averaged just 2.1 per cent, the lowest figure since the
Confederation of British Industry started recording these numbers in 1977,
further underlined theories that inflation pressures are subdued for the
time being.
Sterling's strength has helped the gilt market to show its recent healthy
tone. On Friday, the pound's value as measured by the Bank's trade-weight
index edged up to 81.4 - close to the high for the year of 81.6 registered
two months ago - with a generally good showing against both the D-Mark and
the dollar. Even though it closed slightly down on Friday night against the
D-Mark at 2.5575, this was only  1/2 pfennig below its highest level for the
year against the currency.
While few figures last week gave any concrete indications of the speed of
any recovery, most of the anecdotal evidence gave the impression of economic
weakness. In particular, a record number of businesses collapsed in England,
Wales and Scotland in the second quarter, illustrating specifically the
fragile state of many small companies.
Although figures for company failures are generally thought of as giving few
insights into future economic trends, it may not require many more pieces of
poor economic news before Mr Clarke starts to think seriously about bringing
down base rates from 6 per cent for the first cut since January. The cut in
German interest rates last week - the discount rate came down  1/2
percentage point to 6.75 per cent and the Lombard rate fell  1/4 point to
8.25 per cent - may create a better backcloth for such a move.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Danish Bonds: Yield gap with Germany narrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH government bonds have performed well this year, with the effective
yield coming down from about 9 per cent in December to 6.83 per cent at the
end of last week on the 10-year government benchmark bond.
Investors have benefited not only from a general fall in interest rates this
year, but also from a narrowing of the yield spread between Danish and
German bonds, which at times in the second half of last year was as much as
2 percentage points, but is now down to about 21 basis points.
The yield spread widened when the voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in
the referendum last summer and has narrowed now that the electorate, in the
May 18 referendum this year, has finally approved the treaty.
The fall in yields and rise in prices, combined with a rising need for
government debt finance, sent turnover in the first half-year to a record.
The current benchmark bond carries a coupon of 8 per cent, but its place
will probably be taken by the 7 per cent bond maturing in 2004, which was
launched earlier this year, as turnover in this series grows.
On Thursday last week, the first government issue carrying a 6 per cent
coupon was issued - Treasury notes maturing in 1996. A total of DKr11bn of
paper was sold within an hour of opening, although the pricing, 99.75,
giving an effective yield of 6.08 per cent, was considered ambitious.
The market is already preparing for a 10-year issue carrying the 6 per cent
coupon. The Guarantee Institute for Futures and Options is hesitating
between introducing a futures contract on the 7 per cent bond or waiting a
while before launching one on the expected 6 per cent (or even lower) paper
instead.
There is, meanwhile, an interesting situation in the mortgage bond market.
Mortgage bonds carry higher yields than government bonds and there are big,
liquid series, but the bonds have some characteristics which tend to put off
international investors.
The big series are in annuity loans, not bullets, and are callable (ie,
redeemable at par before maturity). The major development over the next few
months and into next year will be that householders are able to convert from
bonds carrying coupons of 9 to 12 per cent into new series with a coupon 6
per cent. The first 20 and 30-year issues with 6 per cent coupons were
launched last week. The 30-year bonds were priced at 95.00, giving an
effective yield of 6.7 per cent.
The mortgage institutes and large institutional investors expect that bonds
worth some DKr300bn will be converted.
The interesting point of the exercise for international investors is that
the bond-issuing mortgage credit institutes will take the opportunity to
launch some very large series, and although issued by the different
institutes they will have identical characteristics, which will allow them
to be traded as one large series.
There is an interesting macro-economic aspect to the conversion boom as
well. As the governor of the Nationalbank, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, has said, it
will have an unprecedented wealth effect for householders. Conversion means
that the cost of annual mortgage servicing will fall. It also means that the
typical mortgage level will fall from the chimney to the gutter, opening up
an opportunity for additional borrowing.
It so happens that this effect will coincide with a rise in demand in 1994
and 1995 as the result of a reform of the income tax system, a reform which
in these two years will not be fully financed.
At the same time, there is a big programme of public sector infra-structure
investments. The tax reform and public investment programme will pump around
DKr12bn to DKr15bn, equal to 1.2 to 1.5 per cent of GDP, into the economy in
1994. The bond conversion boom could add another half per cent of GDP to
this effect. What nobody professes to know, however, is whether consumers
will spend the extra money or take the opportunity further to reduce their
debts/increase savings.

FT  05 JUL 93 / US Money and Credit: Prices increase as fears on inflation
subside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL last week, the US bond market clung to its newfound conviction that
inflation is no longer an immediate threat to the economy, and that the
forthcoming price data will bear the helpful imprint of the cigarette wars.
So bond prices rose, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue
tumbled to its lowest level since the authorities began issuing this type of
paper on a regular basis 16 years ago.
In fact, several new 'records' were set during the week. The long bond's
yield dipped to a 'record' low of 6.67 per cent on Monday evening, having
stood at 6.7 per cent at the end of the previous week. By Friday night, it
had fallen further still, entering the July 4 holiday weekend at 6.66 per
cent.
Bolstering this cavalier approach to the nation's economic fortunes was a
series of statistics which indicated that the manufacturing sector remains
at low ebb.
On Thursday, for example, the National Association of Purchasing Management
reported that its index fell to 48.3 per cent in June, compared with 51.1
per cent in May. Any reading below the 50 per cent mark suggests that
manufacturing activity in the economy is contracting.
But the most significant announcement came on Friday, when the Labor
Department reported that non-farm payroll employment rose by just 13,000 in
June.
The nation's unemployment rate, meanwhile, edged back up to 7 per cent last
month, with some 53,000 manufacturing jobs being eliminated.
The figures were significantly below the market's formal estimates - most
pundits had pitched their predictions for the non-farm payroll employment
increase at between 100,000 and 130,000. That said, a suspicion that the
data would be weak had grown during the latter half of the week.
As a result, bond price movements were relatively muted in the wake of the
news. The most noticeable immediate effect was a steepening of the yield
curve, with the short-dated end of the market rising in response to the
data, and the long-dated end lagging, still hampered by nervousness over
rising gold and commodity prices.
By mid-morning on Friday, analysts said that the yield spread between
two-year notes and the 30-year long bond had widened to around 274 basis
points.
However, by the time that business had trickled away for the long
Independence Day weekend, both ends of the market were at least showing
price gains and the long bond yield - although not at its lowest level for
the week - was only a smidgeon away.
Analysts are virtually unanimous in concluding that the latest run of
economic data means that Federal Reserve officials will leave interest rates
untouched when the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets later
this week.
The bond market, however, will have little additional information to guide
its path next week.
The only significant set of statistics due to be released during the
shortened four-day week is the May consumer instalment credit numbers, which
will be published on Wednesday.
Instead, bond traders are likely to focus their attention on the following
week's inflation numbers, with the June producer price index due to be
unveiled on July 13, and the consumer price numbers to be released on July
14.
Already, analysts are predicting that lower food prices, the drop in the
cost of tobacco products, and softer energy quotes should pare back the PPI
and leave the CPI unchanged during the month.

GREAT NORDIC Holding, which administers its shareholding in the
telecommunications and electro-technical manufacturing group GN Great
Nordic, reported a decline in net profits from DKr23.8m (Dollars 3.64m) to
DKr8.9m in the year to June 30, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
An unchanged dividend of DKr12 per share (12 per cent) will be paid.
GN Great Nordic's operating profit increased from DKr96m to DKr113m but
after extraordinary items, covering restructuring costs and write-downs,
profits fell from DKr93m to DKr33m.
The holding company said GN Great Nordic's operating profit would improve in
the current year as income from administration of new telecommunications
cables came in.
The cables include the optical fibre cable link between Copenhagen and St
Petersburg, with a microwave link to Moscow, which came into operation in
April and has brought a significant improvement in telecommunications
between Russia and western Europe.
