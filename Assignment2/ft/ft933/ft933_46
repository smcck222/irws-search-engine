<TEXT>
HUA NAN Commercial Bank of Taiwan is to upgrade its operations in Hong Kong
to provide financial services to Taiwanese companies operating in China from
Hong Kong.
Mr H. T. Chien, deputy general manager at the bank's Taipei headquarters,
said that Hua Nan's application to strengthen its presence was approved by
Hong Kong's Executive Council last week.
Hua Nan, which is one of Taiwan's leading state-run banks, opened a
representative office in Hong Kong in 1988 and submitted an application to
upgrade to a branch in April 1993, after receiving permission from Taiwan's
ministry of finance.
Three state-run banks have applied to upgrade representative offices into
branches, including the Bank of Taiwan, the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank Ltd
and the First Commercial Bank.
Hua Nan said the new branch would primarily provide trade finance to Taiwan
companies with offices in Hong Kong.
More than 10,000 Taiwan companies are estimated to have investments in
China. Most use overseas Chinese-run banks or foreign banks in Hong Kong for
financial services in the triangular trade between Taiwan, Hong Kong and
China.
The bank will also assist such companies secure working capital for freight
fees, providing letters of credit, foreign exchange transactions and deposit
services.
The bank's ability to provide such services will be boosted by new rules,
effective from May, allowing overseas branches of Taiwan banks to have
business ties with overseas branches of mainland-based banks.
'We should be able to attract many of the Taiwan firms as they are our
customers here,' the bank said. 'We are optimistic that we can operate the
Hong Kong branch profitably from the very beginning.'
The branch will open in the Central Plaza Building in Wanchai by
end-September, manned by seven staff members from Taiwan and some
locally-hired employees. Its manager will be the current head of the
representative office, Mr T. C. Wu.

<TEXT>
RWE, the German energy-based conglomerate, expects to pay an unchanged DM12
per share dividend this year after holding annual profits at DM877m (Dollars
516m), around the same level as in 1991-92.
The group, which forecast an unchanged result last autumn, said it also
expected 'stable developments' in turnover for the current year to June
1994.
Sales in the year under review rose by just 1.2 per cent to DM52.4bn,
including DM19bn from energy and DM21bn from oil and chemicals, the company
said at the weekend.
Improved profits from energy, construction, mining and raw materials
combined to offset declines, especially in the printing machinery and oil
and chemicals divisions.
RWE, based in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia, enjoys a strong position as a
monopoly power supplier in some of the most heavily industrialised regions
of Germany.
While pursuing an aggressive global diversification programme, the company
is still basically an energy group. It is strongly represented in the
eastern German mining and energy sectors, and recently announced a plan to
take a 4 to 5 per cent stake in Endesa, Spain's state-controlled electricity
concern.

<TEXT>
GENERAL ELECTRIC, the US industrial and services company, has announced that
second-quarter earnings are likely to be higher than analysts' expectations,
and has unveiled a non-cash, after-tax Dollars 862m first-quarter charge for
a change in accounting methods.
It expects to announce record second-quarter earnings per share later this
month - higher than the Dollars 1.53 average of analysts' expectations.
The company will restate its first-quarter figures to include a charge of
Dollars 862m because of its adoption of Financial Accounting Standards
Statement 112, which must be adopted by all US companies by 1994.
GE is one of the first leading companies to adopt the standard, which
requires companies to account for the cost of certain post-employment
benefits, such as redundancy payments, over the working lives of employees
rather than when the payments are made. The standard does not cover post
retirement pension, medical and life insurance benefits.

three Japanese banks

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE LEADING Japanese banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan and Norinchukin, the agriculture bank, have set up
securities subsidiaries, allowed as part of ongoing financial deregulation.
The ministry of finance has given banks a greater role in bond markets,
while existing securities houses will be allowed to establish trust banking
subsidiaries and be given more freedom in foreign exchange dealings.
IBJ Securities is capitalised at Y25bn (Dollars 232m) and will have an
initial staff of 138, while LTCB Securities is capitalised at Y20bn and will
have a staff of 85. Norinchukin Securities has a capital of Y15bn and 42
employees.
The banks had prepared several months ago for the establishment of the
securities subsidiaries, but were awaiting approval from the finance
ministry, which still has great influence over the entry of companies into
new markets.
The ministry is expected to review deregulation early next year and consider
giving permission to a broader range of banks to open subsidiaries. The
ministry has also indicated that, after two or three years, banks may be
allowed to deal in stocks, although that is opposed by brokers.
The new securities subsidiaries are expected to begin trading later this
month, and are likely to concentrate on winning new business in the
underwriting of straight bonds, increasingly popular among Japanese
companies seeking to diversify their sources of funds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT LYONNAIS, the big French bank, has strengthened its position in Italy
by reinforcing its hold on Banca Lombarda, a small 23-branch Milanese bank.
Credit Lyonnais, which already owns 30 per cent of the bank, is buying 49
per cent of Geinvest, a holding company which owns 26.2 per cent of the
holding company controlling Banca Lombarda.
The latest acquisition may represent a further step in a strategy to develop
the Credit Lyonnais presence in Italy. The French bank is already one of the
biggest foreign players in Italian retail banking because of its controlling
stake in Credito Bergamasco, a big Bergamo-based regional bank, in which it
now owns 58 per cent of the shares.
Although Credito Bergamasco, which is highly profitable, has been expanding
rapidly in northern Italy, it remains poorly represented in the Milan area -
where Banca Lombarda is strongest.
A spokesman for Credit Lyonnais, which has not revealed the price of its
latest purchase, declined to comment on whether it aimed to gain full
control of Banca Lombarda eventually.
Banca Lombarda, which is controlled by a group of long-established Milanese
families, had a loan book of L654bn (Dollars 424m) last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GIROCREDIT, Austria's third-largest bank, reported a 68 per cent rise in
bank operating income to Sch895m (Dollars 75m) for the first half of 1993,
marking a turnround from the sharp profit decline of 1992.
Mr Hans Haumer, chairman, said he expected the bank to achieve operating
earnings of about Sch1.7bn for the full year, up 30 per cent.
He said the improvement was due to a larger interest margin following the
decline in European interest rates and strong gains in fee and trading
income. After heavy losses on foreign lending in the previous years, the
bank has boosted domestic loan activities while reducing its international
exposure, Mr Haumer said.
Balance sheet assets climbed a moderate 2 per cent to Sch329bn in the first
half and are expected to increase by 3 to 4 per cent for the full year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German airline, had an operating loss of DM482m (Dollars
284m) in the first five months of 1993 despite an 8 per cent cut in staff
costs compared with the same 1992 period, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
A Lufthansa spokesman gave no comparative figure, but said the loss in the
January-May period of 1992 had been considerably higher. He said the carrier
had saved about DM231m on staff costs in the past 12 months. But average
earnings per passenger in the period had fallen by 11 per cent to DM336.
Lufthansa continues to believe that it will be able to halve its 1992
operating loss in 1993. It expects 1994 to be a profitable year if the
global economy recovers and a spiral of declining prices ends.
The airline had a 1992 group loss of DM391m against a 1991 loss of DM426m.
In the 1993 first quarter it reported a parent company loss of DM245m
compared with a DM386m loss in the same period of 1992.
In the first five months of 1993 group costs fell by 5 per cent, or DM336m,
from the same 1992 period, while group income fell by only 1 per cent or
DM71m.

FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rover plans strong North
American drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND ROVER North America has outlined to its 80-strong dealer network a
strategy to quadruple sales of its UK-built four-wheel-drive vehicles in the
US.
Plans to lift annual sales to 16,000, from just over 4,000 last year, depend
heavily on the success of the Land Rover Discovery model, which is to be
launched in North America early next year. Currently, dealers are selling
only the luxury Range Rover and high specification versions of the utility
Land Rover Defender.
The company, part of the British Aerospace-owned Rover Group, is calling for
a substantial structural change in the dealer network to cope with the
expansion.
Mr David Schworm, vice-president, has told dealers by letter that Land Rover
wants as many as possible to drop their practice of selling its products
alongside other luxury vehicle franchises - known as 'dualling' - and set up
large outlets selling exclusively Land Rover's vehicles.
These 'Land Rover Centres', of which the company would like about 30, would
have sales territories covering many square miles and would operate
'satellite' showrooms under the same ownership. The concept, aimed at
preventing Land Rover dealers from having to compete against each other, has
been pioneered - with considerable success - in North America by General
Motors' Saturn subsidiary.
However, Saturn is a volume franchise. Dealers in other more up-market makes
have traditionally resisted their manufacturers' pressure for exclusive
outlets, arguing that they do not offer adequate returns. Such resistance is
understood to lie at least partly behind Mazda of Japan's decision last year
not to proceed with setting up a separate luxury car sales channel - Amati -
at a time of economic recession.
The Discovery, which is expected to sell for some Dollars 30,000 (Pounds
20,000) in the US, compared with Dollars 40,000 upwards for the Range Rover,
is expected rapidly to take the lion's share of Land Rover's intended 16,000
total annual sales in North America.
Earlier this month it was announced that Honda, which has a 20 per cent
shareholding in Rover, was to sell the Discovery under its own badge in
Japan, where it will be known as the Honda Crossroad.

The move reflects increasing confidence among investors in the commercial
insurance and reinsurance markets where rates have risen sharply in recent
months. Sphere Drake, whose majority shareholders include Electra Investment
Trust, Dai Tokyo Fire and Marine, and Center Capital Investors, is a leader
in the London reinsurance market. Net assets of the group's London-based
insurance company currently amount to Pounds 75m. Net premium income
amounted to Pounds 200m in 1992.
The IPO offer will be underwritten by a group of underwriters for whom Smith
Barney, Harris Upham, Lazard Freres and Salomon Brothers are acting as
representatives. The IPO is scheduled for the middle of September, although
no decision on timing has been made.

FT  05 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The omnipresence of the water regulator -
Ofwat's annual price review will restrict the water companies' expansion
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER reporting profits and dividend increases in line with expectations,
and well ahead of other industries, the privatised UK water companies may
feel aggrieved that their share prices failed to respond.
Since March the sector has fallen about 15 per cent, sometimes amid unusual
levels of volatility. The water reporting season, which with the exception
of Welsh Water ended last month, also failed to inspire its traditional
rally.
Unfortunately for shareholders, the predictability of the water utilities
has been overshadowed by a process over which the companies have less
control - the 1994 periodic review by regulator, Ofwat.
Ofwat took care not to comment on companies' performance before the results,
but the regulator's presence could be felt at all the presentations.
Companies are starting work on strategic business plans, which will be
submitted to Ofwat next March and will form the basis of negotiation for
price rises until the end of the decade.
Companies were only quizzed on the initial assumptions which lay behind
their plans. Many areas of discussion, such as future environmental
standards on urban waste water and pesticides, have yet to be decided. Ofwat
is also yet to announce its views on complex matters such as levels of
return that companies, and therefore shareholders, can expect from
investment. This is also known as the 'cost of capital' debate.
While attention will focus on subjects like the cost of capital, companies
and their regulator are likely to agree that a simpler benchmark should be
interest cover covenants.
Since the companies were privatised debt free, their interest cover has
remained high compared to the market. For example, North West Water still
has interest cover of over seven times, even though borrowings have mounted
as the company's investment programme gathered pace.
Companies say their banking covenants require them to keep interest cover at
two times or greater. They further argue the need for some degree of comfort
as their capital expenditure programmes mount up. For some companies, this
means interest cover should not fall below four times.
Ofwat is unlikely to risk pushing companies too close to their borrowing
limits because a breached banking facility would be embarrasing for the
regulator as well as the company.
But there are a number of areas for potential disagreement. Companies are
not forecasting rights issues, which Ofwat may assume. This would allow
price rises to be kept lower and would at least delay the moment companies
reached their minimum interest cover 'troughs'.
Also, it is difficult to see why companies with very different spending
plans say they need the same 'K', the amount companies can increase prices
above the rate of inflation.
For example, Anglian Water has one of the highest spending plans to the end
of the decade, partly because of spending on beaches. Severn Trent, which
has a much lower investment profile, and no beaches, forecast a K of 6 per
cent in its market plan, the same as Anglian.
According to one analyst, the K requirements now being discussed are partly
designed as 'customer conditioning', to stress to the public that raising
water standards is very expensive. With some companies, the requests should
also be seen as opening gambits with the regulator.
Mr Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, has indicated that he would be
unhappy with real price rises of more than 2 per cent in the second half of
the decade, suggesting the companies are heading for some hard negotiating.
Aside from the regulatory questions, results for the companies' unregulated
businesses continued to disappoint. Companies have often argued that
unregulated earnings have suffered from recession and will only become
significant after the periodic review when regulation is likely to be
tougher.
As expected, Severn Trent's waste management company, Biffa, remained loss
making after interest costs. More surprisingly, Northumbrian Water's
unregulated businesses also lost money after interest costs.
Northumbrian had been seen as small enough to generate a reasonable
proportion of profits - perhaps more than a quarter - outside its core,
regulated business. Last year's results, and a setback at Amtec Europe, a
pipeline maintenance company, suggested Northumbrian is several years away
from its goal.
Thames Water's unregulated businesses did manage to record pre-tax profits,
but the total was disappointing. Excluding inter-company transactions, the
unregulated businesses made profits of Pounds 2.2m on sales of Pounds
234.4m. Thames blamed weak overseas markets, although one environmental
services subsidiary lost Pounds 2m due to poor management.
An expected run of enhanced scrip dividend alternatives failed to
materialise. North West, the first to announce profits, did offer an
enhanced scheme and said the money saved would be used towards its
unregulated business.
But the issue was poorly received by institutional shareholders, who
complained the issue was effectively a mini-rights issue. Several other
water companies later admitted they had looked at offering enhanced scrips
but changed their minds after learning of the reaction to North West.
Another area of controversy was infrastructure renewals, the annual charge
made to cover spending on maintainance of underground assets like pipework.
Northumbrian indicated in advance that its renewals charge was being lowered
to reflect over-provisioning in prior years. Severn Trent, however,
announced a change of policy with its results, helping to boost profits by
Pounds 15.9m.
The company was criticised for its move, which was seen by analysts as a
form of profits massage. But it also raised the question of the accounting
treatment of renewals, which Ofwat is reviewing ahead of the periodic
review.
The confusion was highlighted by figures from Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell at
NatWest Securities. These show Yorkshire Water's infrastructure renewals
charge last year represented nearly 15 per cent of its utility revenues,
while Southern Water's charge was only 5 per cent. Although some of the
difference can be explained by relative ages of the assets, it also shows
that valuing underground pipework remains an inexact science.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Sugar plans to oust Crystal at Spurs egm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN Sugar, the chair-man of Tottenham Hotspur, is planning to call an
extraordinary general meeting of the company in an attempt to oust Mr
Jonathan Crystal from the board.
Mr Crystal is the only remaining director who supports Mr Terry Venables,
the former chief executive sacked by Mr Sugar, following their bitter court
battle over control of the London football club.
Mr Sugar is expected to announce within the next two or three days that an
egm will be held on July 30. This will be just inside the minimum 21 days'
notice required for such a meeting.
Mr Sugar has stated his intention to force Mr Venables out of the company,
but has undertaken not to oust the former chief executive from the board
until High Court hearings over their dispute are complete some time this
autumn.
The Sugar camp yesterday said it would abide by this undertaking.
The move against Mr Crystal has been long expected. During the battle
between Mr Sugar and Mr Venables, Mr Crystal has been a solid champion of Mr
Venables' cause.
Although individual shareholders will be invited to the egm, the meeting is
likely to prove a formality. Mr Sugar owns 47 per cent of the company and
his long-time ally Mr Tony Berry a further 5 per cent.
Neither Mr Crystal nor Mr Venables was available for comment.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Economics Notebook: Questions over Latin American bond wagon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE welcome mat is still out for Latin American borrowers in the
international bond market. The funds raised so far this year already exceed
last year's total, but will the welcome last?
According to figures from Peter West, of West Merchant Bank in London, 59
Latin borrowers raised Dollars 6.74bn (Pounds 4.5bn) in the second quarter,
outstripping the previous record first-quarter tally of Dollars 3.49bn.
So far this year, new Latin bond issues have totalled Dollars 10.2bn, more
than 1992's entire output of Dollars 9.6bn. In an active half-year in the
international bond market, they have accounted for 5 per cent of the funds
raised.
The first-half total was swollen by some big Mexican private-sector issues,
including the largest issue by a Latin American company - a Dollars 1bn
issue for Cemex - and a Dollars 750m bond for Bancomer.
More big issues are on the cards: the US subsidiary of the Venezuelan state
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela plans a Dollars 1bn issue in the US
public bond market. Argentina is putting together a Dollars 1bn medium-term
note programme, of which the first tranche is expected to be a Dollars 250m
bond.
More Chilean issues could follow the Dollars 150m bond for Celulosa Arauco y
Constitucion, which achieved the lowest yield spread yet over US Treasuries
of any Latin corporate bond (210 basis points). These include a bond for the
republic at a very aggressive spread, indicating its investment grade
status.
However, some market watchers see cause for worry. At a recent City Forum
conference in London, Mr Gerrit-Jan Tammes, vice-chairman of ING Bank, of
the Netherlands, cited comparisons between today and the 1870s when Latin
American bonds were being bought by 'country clergymen, widows, poor
professional men and tradesmen'. Default ensued with 'parallels simply too
striking to ignore' to the present day.
'Now, as then,' he said, 'we have seen a relative deterioration in the
quality of borrowers accessing markets; less and less transparency in the
intended uses of funds borrowed in the markets; and more poorly-informed
players in the market on both the sales and the investor sides.'
In the 1920s, too, the international capital markets were accused of,
according to authors Barry Eichengreen and Richard Portes, 'all manner of
excesses'. Among other things, 'the issue houses pushed questionable
obligations on hesitant borrowers and questionable bonds on otherwise
cautious investors' and 'private investors discriminated inadequately
between good and bad credit risks'.
In fact, every half century or so has seen another Latin American debt
crisis: the 1820s, 1870s, 1930s and 1980s. Indeed, the 1980s crisis may have
taken less time to resolve, in the sense that borrowing countries have
regained access relatively rapidly to foreign capital.
One reason for this rapid return to grace is that Latin governments had the
good sense in the 1980s to burn foreign banks instead of foreign
bondholders. With only minor exceptions, they kept bondholders happy. The
small amounts of outstanding bonds meant that it was relatively inexpensive
to do so. By contrast, the amount of debt in bond form now outstanding is
significantly larger.
In the first place, a lot of bank debt has been converted into bonds under
the Brady debt reduction initiative. Eight countries - all Latin American
except the Philippines and Nigeria - have issued Brady bonds with a face
value of Dollars 94bn. According to JP Morgan Securities, about Dollars 81bn
of this is in readily tradeable form.
Furthermore, since 1989 - when Bancomext of Mexico launched a Dollars 100m
issue to reopen international capital markets for Latin borrowers - some 250
issuers have launched more than Dollars 25bn of Eurobonds.
This suggests that the 'specialness' that protected bond issues during the
1980s is gradually being lost. A huge variation in quality has also been
evident, suggesting that the market's default-free reputation will not last
for ever.
For example, more Brazilian borrowers - their economy hardly the jewel in
the Latin American crown - have issued bonds than any other country group.
In the second quarter, 24 Brazilian issuers raised Dollars 1.7bn, second
only to Mexico's Dollars 3.3bn. Brazilian banks have been particularly
frequent visitors - launching standard Dollars 50m bonds with 2 1/2 -year
maturities. Much of the money raised goes straight into the Brazilian money
markets, where inflation-adjusted interest rates are high.
Many of the buyers of this Brazilian paper - along with most of the Eurobond
issues since the market reopened - have been 'retail' investors. These
individuals, many of them Latin American, have been looking for better
returns than have been available in more traditional markets, particularly
the US.
They tend to buy on the basis of yield, typically seeking double-digit
interest rates. As the perceived credit quality of the region has improved,
thanks to better economic management, they have had to seek riskier credits
to preserve the required yields.
It is far from clear that these investors will retain their interest in the
market once US interest rates turn upward. In an International Monetary Fund
staff paper published this year, Guillermo Calvo and others conclude that
'swings in private capital outflows from the US play a key role as external
impulses that affect the size of capital inflows into Latin America'.
One possible conclusion is that once the US market provides higher returns,
some of these investors will forget Latin America.
However, there is a counter-trend for which the Cemex issue provides
evidence. It was not retail investors who swallowed Dollars 1bn of Cemex
paper, but institutions, mainly from the US. These investors are more
conscious of credit quality and not simply chasing high absolute yields.
Their entry into the market suggests that higher-quality borrowers from
Latin America may well have longer-term access to regular bond market
finance - provided, that is, the region continues the economic improvement
evident over the last few years.

FT  05 JUL 93 / GEC and BAe dismiss report of defence merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S General Electric Company and British Aerospace yesterday dismissed
as speculation a report that they were holding preliminary talks that could
lead to a merger of their defence interests.
But officials at both companies did not rule out the long-term possibility
of closer links. They are the UK's largest defence suppliers, with combined
military sales of about Pounds 7bn.
The prospect of a merger with GEC-Marconi is understood not to have been
discussed by the board of BAe Defence, the company set up early last year
combining the BAe group's military aircraft, missiles, munitions and systems
and services divisions.
However, ideas on a long-term reshaping of the UK defence industry have been
voiced in discussions between the two groups, which have close working
connections on projects such as the four-nation Eurofighter.
Rumours of GEC plans to launch a complete or partial takeover of BAe have
surfaced several times over the past two years. Active contacts between the
two companies took place in 1991, with Sir Peter Levene, previously the
Ministry of Defence's procurement chief, playing an important role alongside
Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director. Further rumours circulated when BAe
shares came under heavy pressure last year.
GEC focused on BAe's Dynamics division, which makes guided weapons, and on
its space activities. But discussions on the sale of the space division to
Matra Marconi Space, a joint venture between GEC-Marconi and Matra of
France, fell through.
The latest report comes while both companies are negotiating other defence
deals. GEC is negotiating the purchase of Thorn EMI's defence interests. BAe
is discussing details of a planned missile merger with Matra, a venture
which could subsequently bring in other European producers.
GEC-Marconi supplies electronic equipment for most of the aircraft and
missiles produced by BAe, and has sought to establish itself as a prime
contractor for top defence projects.
Until recently, the Ministry of Defence would have been opposed to a merger
between the two, in order to preserve competition. However, it is thought
that in today's smaller defence market the MoD would be more likely to
accede to such a plan.
Since 1989, GEC has already absorbed large parts of its two main UK
electronics rivals, Plessey and Ferranti International.

FT  05 JUL 93 / VW loses top man in structural shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DANIEL Goeudevert has been squeezed out of his post as vice-chairman of
the Volkswagen group as a result of a 'structural reorganisation', VW said
at the weekend.
He will leave at the end of July by 'mutual agreement'. His main duties,
responsibility for the VW brand - accounting for two-thirds of group sales -
will be taken on by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, but Mr Goeudevert will
continue to be a consultant.
Once favourite to become group chairman, he lost to Mr Piech in last
autumn's selection, when the scale of the group's crisis was becoming clear.
Since then he has increasingly appeared the odd man out, especially
following the arrival in March of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as
group production and procurement director. This further eroded his
operational role, leaving him basically in charge of marketing the VW
marque, while Mr Lopez was adopted as the chairman's closest confidant.
Mr Goeudevert's intellectual approach set him further apart from the
engineering duo committed to rescuing Germany's biggest volume car
manufacturer.
He was also tainted by Mr Piech's accusation against the former group board
that it had failed to do its 'homework' during the eight prosperous years
before VW was overtaken by recession in the second half of 1992.
After a DM1.25bn (Pounds 489m) loss in the first quarter of this year, the
group is heading rapidly back into the black, according to Mr Piech.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Private briefings come under the public eye: Peter Montagnon
writes on legal and illegal company communications to analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Butterworth, chief executive of London International Group, barely
smiles when asked about the reprimand his company received from the stock
exchange in April. The company, best known for its 35 per cent share of the
world branded condom market, agreed with the exchange that neither would
comment further on the revelations that LIG had selectively briefed 13
analysts and four institutions about its falling profits. According to Mr
Butterworth, there is nothing more to be said.
The City investment community, however, thinks otherwise. It has begun an
anxious debate about how companies should communicate with the outside
world. In the background is a sense that private briefings of analysts and
investors have been getting out of hand. Companies naturally want to prepare
the ground for news about a change in their fortunes. The LIG affair shows
this becomes too much of a good thing when it leads to some investors
receiving favoured treatment.
The situation is made more acute by institutional pressure on companies to
be more forthcoming. LIG maintains it was singled out for something that
others also do. One risk is that those with something to hide now have an
excuse to clam up. The price of continued openness may be a proliferation of
official statements, deluging investors with trivial information.
A further complication is the insider trading legislation currently before
parliament. The draconian approach of the original draft has been softened,
but companies and brokers remain worried about whether they can safely
continue the informal briefings on which they have relied for years.
The conviction earlier this year of a Scottish analyst, Mr Thorold Mackie,
for insider dealing strikes fear into many stockbrokers. Some two weeks
before Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, issued a profit
warning last September, Mr Mackie met its chairman. While the market as a
whole was still in the dark, he advised his clients to sell the shares.
The case shows how blurred, even under the existing rules, the distinction
is between legality and illegality in the way the information flows.
Analysts rightly say they need regular contact with companies if they are to
make sensible judgments.
The obvious solution is to ensure that price-sensitive information is
communicated to the market through a formal an-nouncement. But it is not
easy to know in advance what material is price sensitive or how the market
will react to the simple news that a briefing has taken place.
Within two days of a briefing last month for eight analysts on the
organisation of its UK division, Standard Chartered's share price rose 6 per
cent. The bank says it gave no financial information at the meeting. Some of
the upward pressure on its shares may have come from brokers not at the
meeting, who simply thought that positive news must have been imparted.
The problem is exacerbated if, as in this case, brokers use innocuous
briefings as a peg to publicise adjustments to their forecasts that were in
train anyway.
Lucas Industries is trying a different approach. On the morning after a
dinner for analysts at this year's Paris air show, the company issued a
detailed statement of what had been said, though not before its share price
had fallen sharply. Subsequently it announced in advance that it was taking
analysts to visit one of its plants and released a statement while the visit
was taking place.
Lucas says it is especially alert to the stricter climate because of the bid
rumours swirling round it this year. But some say its approach smacks of
overkill. 'You cannot put out a statement every time an analyst rings up,'
says one investor relations professional.
So what should companies do to ensure that they maintain an adequate,
digestible flow of information to investors, while staying within the rules?
Most expect the answer will inevitably involve more formal statements. The
more information is in the public domain, the more companies will feel
comfortable explaining detail and context to analysts and institutions.
The stock exchange has been reviewing its guidelines, but so far has found
no reason to change them. Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, has, however, come
up with some suggestions. It believes companies should make more use of
regular events such as annual meetings to talk about current trading and
strategy. There would then be less risk of the market's expectation
departing from reality. When it does, companies should promptly issue a
statement.
Regular corporate announcements tend, though, to be bunched into the earlier
part of the financial year. There is a long gap between the interim figures
and full-year results. One possibility would be a routine trading statement
towards the end of the year, when many companies are anyway briefing
analysts.
Last year the Rank Organisation began briefing groups of analysts twice a
year before going into closed season on its interim and final results. It
used to call them in individually, but found this gave an advantage to the
broker lucky enough to be invited first. To be extra sure of fair treatment,
it puts out the main details of its message in a formal statement.
Some might see this as a step towards quarterly reporting, already practised
by many companies with a listing in the US. BAT Industries has even
accelerated the reporting of its quarterly results, which come out soon
after the period has ended. Its closed season begins before the quarter is
over, which helps avoid embarrassing requests from analysts for help with
forecasts. Also, it creates a regular opportunity for statements on matters
of interest such as the US cigarette price war.
This is not, however, to everyone's taste. According to one large
institutional investor the introduction of a quarterly reporting requirement
would be like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It would be expensive
for small companies and encourage a short-term approach. There is no
evidence that it makes share prices less volatile.
ICI reports quarterly, but its new offshoot Zeneca does not intend to follow
suit. 'The issue is reporting of exceptional developments,' says Mr John
Mayo, finance director, 'and the way people are trying to deal with it is
regular reporting. What we need is for people to loosen up a bit about
exceptional reporting.'
That begs the question of how such statements should be published. The
formal requirement is to go through the stock exchange, but its procedures
are slow and its screen is scanned only by professional investors.
Perhaps its monopoly should be removed to promote the widest possible
circulation of announcements. Mr Terry Venables came under fire for warning
about Tottenham Hotspur's profits during BBC Grandstand's cup final
coverage. It is hard to be more public than that.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Disruption feared over security cordon around City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, JIMMY BURNS and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITY cordon set up around the City of London at the weekend faces
its first test today amid fears that it could cause widespread traffic
congestion.
The anti-terrorist scheme, which rings London's financial heart with 24-hour
police checkpoints, has received broad support from business, which pressed
for tighter security after the Bishopsgate bomb attack by the Provisional
IRA two months ago.
But with 18 roads leading into the Square Mile being closed under the
scheme, police and City leaders were preparing for a barrage of complaints
from frustrated motorists.
The City of London Police, stressing that the scheme was experimental,
appealed to commuters to leave their cars at home. 'For the first days there
will be problems. It would be naive of us to expect otherwise,' the police
said.
The RAC, the motoring organisation, said it was unhappy about the City being
treated in isolation. 'The scheme could transfer the traffic, and
potentially, the terrorists to other areas,' it warned.
The Corporation of London, which is funding the Pounds 200,000 scheme,
expects 3,000 cars an hour will be displaced to other parts of London by the
security scheme, while a further 5,000 an hour try to pass through the City
during the first few days.
The scheme is planned to operate for 12 months, pending a public inquiry
into further security measures.
Bus drivers have been issued with instructions about route diversions -
although a helpline operator said many were still struggling to make sense
of the new maps.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of London's policy
committee, admitted that while the scheme would give better protection
against the threat of car bombs, it could not guard against hand-held
devices.

FT  05 JUL 93 / UN pulls its weapons inspectors out of Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS weapons inspectors are to pull out of Baghdad today amid
warnings from Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, that the
latest stand-off might provoke another confrontation with Iraq.
Mr Nikita Smidovich, the UN weapons inspectors' leader, said his team was
leaving after unsuccessful attempts since June 4 to persuade the Iraqi
authorities to install video cameras to monitor a pair of missile testing
sites.
In a television interview in Washington, Mr Christopher said Iraq's refusal
was 'a very significant violation' of UN resolutions. He added: 'They've
been through a long policy of what's been referred to as cheat and retreat.
Maybe they will be in that situation again, but it's a bad sign that our
inspectors are having to leave there not being able to proceed with the
installation of the cameras.'
The UN Security Council has adopted a resolution warning Iraq of 'serious
consequences' if it fails to install the cameras at the Yam al-Azim and
Al-Rafah sites, part of the UN's continuing mandate under Gulf war ceasefire
resolutions to inspect and destroy Iraq's weapons.
Iraq has said it would consider installing the cameras only after a broader
discussion of arms control with the UN commission scheduled for next Monday.
The renewed tension may cloud the atmosphere surrounding talks due to open
in New York on Wednesday between UN legal experts and Iraqi oil ministry
officials over a possible limited resumption of Iraqi oil sales.
The talks will be the first for more than a year on a proposed UN exception
to the post-Gulf war embargo on oil sales, permitting Iraq to sell up to
Dollars 1.6bn worth of crude to pay for food, medicines and the cost of UN
operations in Iraq.
Last year Iraq refused the terms of the permitted exception to the embargo,
which could put more than 500,000 barrels of oil a day into the crude
market. It objected in particular to the requirement that UN officials
oversee distribution of the food and medicines.
In Baghdad the dispute over the weapons inspections is likely to raise
apprehension about a further punitive western-led military strike on Iraq,
following the recent US cruise missile attack on the country's intelligence
headquarters.
However, no post-Gulf war strike on Iraq has yet been prompted directly by
any of the numerous confrontations between Baghdad and UN weapons
inspectors.
The January 17 missile attack on Baghdad factories linked to Iraq's nuclear
programme was essentially a US-led initiative and followed rising tension in
the 'no-fly' zone over southern Iraq, after Baghdad had installed
anti-aircraft missiles.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The thought that Bill Clinton and Saddam Hussein would cosy up over oil
exports a week after the US bombed Baghdad is a little odd, to say the
least. But such reverses are almost par for the course in the murky world of
high politics. Iraq seems prepared to be more accommodating about UN
security council conditions on the sale of oil. At the same time the US
seems now to want to direct Iraq through a carrot-and-stick approach, rather
than setting conditions it knows are unacceptable in order to exclude
Baghdad from serious negotiations.
Much may go wrong in the talks, and the US is also in danger of appearing to
usurp the security council's authority. Yet there is now a serious
possibility that 600,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil may be on the market by
the fourth quarter of the year. Needless to say Saudi Arabia and other Opec
members are less than pleased at the prospect of their market share being
eroded. And once the oil has started to flow it may be hard to get the Iraqi
genie back into the bottle.
Given that few had expected Iraq's re-entry, and that oil prices fell last
winter despite Opec's production running near its ceiling, the current
weakness in crude prices is understandable. Opec has proved at its best in
tight spots. Despite the jockeying for position by producers such as Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, cartel members know that their best interests are served
with oil approaching Dollars 20, rather than by pumping the marginal barrel
of Dollars 15 crude.

Short of assuming Chinese citizenship, Mr Rupert Murdoch's original plans
for buying into the Hong Kong-based TVB television station appear stymied.
But Mr Murdoch's career has repeatedly illustrated an uncanny knack for
skirting the biggest of obstacles. Beaming The Sound of Music into China
appears his latest obsession. One way or another, it is a fair bet that
millions of Chinese will be humming The Hills are Alive by the end of the
decade. News may yet be able to gain access to TVB's valuable archives by
means of a restructured deal. It may then seek an alternative base for an
Asian satellite station.
After a prolonged period of enforced consolidation, News is certainly well
placed for renewed growth. The company's free cash flow may surpass ADollars
800m this year with no substantial debt repayments until near the end of the
century. News seems interested in expanding in US TV stations. Its interest
in a 15 per cent stake in Australia's Channel Seven shows it is not
neglecting opportunities in its back yard.
Although the media industry is intrigued by News' renewed energy, it is not
clear that shareholders are equally enamoured. News' grand industrial
ambitions have rarely produced swift financial returns. After their surge in
1991-92, News' shares have hovered around the ADollars 7.50 mark all this
year. The benefits of reduced interest rates on its ADollars 10bn of debt
have already become apparent. News has simply had its recovery earlier than
the rest of the Australian market. It will be a while before the financial
implications of its next great leap forward materialise.

FT  05 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While June's US employment report was unexpectedly weak, jobs grew strongly
in the second quarter taken as a whole. And if the last four years are any
guide the June figures may have to be be revised up in July. Thus Friday's
employment figure may be an aberration. But other indicators such as the
purchasing managers' data suggest a further slowdown. Economic growth may
have been below 2 per cent on an annualised basis in the second quarter.
These cross-currents make it difficult to determine an underlying trend in
the US economy. One of the few things which is clear is that the improvement
in productivity at the end of 1992, with strong growth but few gains in
employment, is now being unwound. The small increase in inflation in the
first quarter and rising precious metal prices are also a worry. Such
signals may deter the Federal Reserve from altering its bias towards raising
interest rates. Certainly there is little prospect of an early rate cut.
With momentum slowing, interest rates stuck, and other leading economies
mired in recession, strong economic growth in the second half of the year is
a fading hope. Further pressure will come if Congress can agree a deficit
reduction package during the summer. Higher taxes while the debt deflation
process is still in train will do little for consumer confidence. Hence Mr
Clinton's apparent enthusiasm for co-ordinated growth strategies in the
run-up to the G7 summit. Given the improbability of such a deal, however, it
seems increasingly hard to justify the optimistic rating of US equities.

FT  05 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: The new Gas man cometh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The impending retirement of Mr Robert Evans leaves British Gas looking for a
new chairman at a difficult time. No one is likely to accept the post while
the company is in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's star chamber. But,
assuming that British Gas survives more or less intact, the matter cannot be
left much longer. At present the company has not said whether it is looking
for a non-executive figurehead or someone to take a more active role, though
the appointment of Mr Cedric Brown as chief executive implies the former.
Mr Brown is an able engineer who seems to realise that the company's sleepy
culture must change, and he is tackling the excessive cost base of the
company. It was also unfortunate that he has had to take over at such a
difficult time. Yet the company's response to the MMC inquiry has been for
the most part reactive and unfocused. It has given little impression of the
kind of company it would like to be, save that its critics are wrong and it
should be left as it stands.
British Gas needs a more coherent vision of its future and its priorities.
It also needs an advocate who is able to explain that strategy clearly. A
strong chairman from outside the gas industry might bring these skills,
particularly if he were to work with Mr Brown on a full-time basis. That
might also help blow some more fresh air through the company's still-musty
corridors. Given his breezy approach, experience in the oil industry and the
City, and now that his labours at Eurotunnel are almost over, perhaps Sir
Alistair Morton might be persuaded to take the chair?

UNITED NATIONS weapons inspectors are to pull out of Baghdad today after
failing to persuade the Iraqi authorities to install video cameras to
monitor a pair of missile testing sites.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, warned in Washington that
the situation could presage another confrontation with Iraq.
The renewed tension arose as Baghdad sent a team of negotiators to New York
for talks with the UN over a possible limited resumption of oil exports.
Mr Nikita Smidovich, the UN weapons inspectors' leader, said his team had
tried since June 4 to win the agreement of the Iraqi authorities but were
unable to change their position.
He said his team would fly out of Iraq today.
The UN Security Council has already adopted a resolution warning Iraq of
'serious consequences' if it fails to install the cameras at the Yam al-Azim
and Al-Rafah sites, part of the UN's continuing mandate under Gulf war
ceasefire resolutions to inspect and destroy Iraq's weapons.
In a television interview, Mr Christopher said Iraq's refusal to allow video
monitoring was 'a very significant violation' of UN resolutions.
'They've been through a long policy of what's been referred to as cheat and
retreat. Maybe they will be in that situation again, but it's a bad sign
that our inspectors are having to leave there not being able to proceed with
the installation of the cameras.'
Iraq has said it would consider installing the cameras only after a broader
discussion of arms control with the UN commission scheduled for July 12.
The stand-off is likely to raise apprehension in Baghdad about a further
punitive western-led military strike on Iraq, following the recent US cruise
missile attack on the country's intelligence headquarters.
However, no post-Gulf war strike on Iraq has yet been prompted directly by
any of the numerous confrontations between Baghdad and UN weapons
inspectors.
The January 17 missile attack on Baghdad factories linked to Iraq's nuclear
programme was essentially a US-led initiative and followed rising tension in
the 'no-fly' zone over southern Iraq, after Baghdad had installed
anti-aircraft missiles.
The stalled UN weapons inspection may, however, cloud the atmosphere

The technicalities of such an agreement were decided in Vienna last year,
but on political grounds, Iraq refused the terms of the permitted exception
to the embargo, which could put more than 500,000 barrels of oil a day into
the crude market.
Iraqi officials particularly objected to the requirement that UN officials
should oversee the distribution of food and medicines paid for under the
scheme, saying it was an unacceptable infringement of the country's
sovereignty.
However, the US last week said it had no objections to such a sale if Iraq
complied with UN terms. Oil prices fell around 70 cents a barrel last week
on worries about Iraqi crude entering an already glutted oil market.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Japan and the US at odds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THEIR erstwhile common enemy dissolved, industrial countries must build
their relationships on a foundation of enlightened self-interest.
Unfortunately, they are far from enlightened, though powerfully
self-interested. The relationship between the US and Japan established after
the second world war looks likely to be the most important casualty.
Lawrence Summers, now US undersecretary of the treasury for international
affairs, argues that the US has developed a 'comprehensive and integrated
approach' to the twin problems of the Japanese current account surplus and
the low penetration of manufactured imports. The US will, he says, focus on
results. It will also bring high-level pressure to achieve what it wants in
semi-annual meetings of the two heads of government. If agreed, the US
proposals would define the relationship between the world's two most
important economies. If not agreed, they would cause serious conflict.
Either way, they are hugely important. The question is whether they also
make sense.
Mr Summers is right to distinguish the overall Japanese current account
surplus from its allegedly low import penetration. More questionable is the
suggestion that 'excessive' current account surpluses must be reduced to 1
1/2 per cent of gross national product, in order to create up to 2m jobs in
the rest of the world. An economy cannot be forecast precisely enough to
make such targeting workable. The analysis is also both too mechanistic and
too short run. In the longer term, export by the Japanese of a mere 10 per
cent of their gross savings should be welcomed. What could be a more useful
outcome of the capital market liberalisation that the US has so long
promoted?
What the world does need from Japan is a strong recovery and, in the longer
term, sustained growth of demand in line with the economy's potential. Mr
Summers is right to demand improvement in Japanese macroeconomic policies.
The biggest mistakes have been in monetary policy, where the Bank of Japan
first allowed a liquidity-driven financial bubble to develop (partly in
response to earlier US pressure for economic expansion) and then eased both
too late and too little.
The second US complaint is about low import penetration. There do remain
official impediments to imports. But the main obstacles are, without doubt,
Japanese businesses, which believe that they benefit from their long-term
relationships, and nationalistic Japanese consumers. To eliminate barriers
created by governments is indeed to 'unmanage' trade, as Mr Summers claims.
But to force private organisations to buy goods they do not want is to
manage it once more.
Mr Summers insists the targets would not be for US goods alone. But the
goods on which the US focuses are those, like supercomputers, in which it
thinks it is competitive. He argues that the aim is to replicate the results
of a free market. But nobody knows what those results might be. He argues
that the desire is to eliminate distortions in the Japanese economy. But the
result is bound to be further management by the ministries. He denies that
the quantitative benchmarks will be triggers for 'hair trigger retaliation'.
But it is deeply naive to suppose US industry will prove so understanding,
as the history of the semi-conductor agreement has demonstrated.
The world desperately needs a more enlightened approach. On macroeconomic
policy, the best solution would be for Japan to accept continued
appreciation of the yen, mitigated, where necessary, by further easing of
its monetary and fiscal policies. On imports, the Japanese should propose a
binding multilateral procedure, within the Gatt, capable of requiring any
member country to change policies that deprive trading partners of the
benefits they had reasonably expected from liberalisation. Japan should
propose just such a reform, along with agricultural liberalisation, as its
contributions to completion of the hapless Uruguay Round. But first it must
say no to US demands for managed trade.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Tories return to the centre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One-nation Toryism is reclaiming its inheritance. The battle for the soul of
the Conservative party has been joined in earnest.
Amid the chaos of Mr John Major's government, the disciples of the social
rather than the liberal market have decided it is time at last to disclaim
publicly the ideology of the 1980s. Thatcherism is to be consigned to the
history books.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, put the case at the weekend in a
lecture to the Tory Reform Group. The Thatcherite revolution had been
appropriate when the trade unions had to be tamed, the state role cut, the
power of market competition unleashed.
But the government had moved too far in the direction of unfettered markets.
There was such a thing as society. And Conservatism should recognise 'the
moral and social inadequacies of laissez-faire'.
The lecture itself - with its call for the party to look again to the
Christian Democrat tradition in the rest of Europe - was no surprise. Mr
Hunt has always been viewed by the Tory right as 'wet' as he is clever. A
disciple of Peter Walker and Michael Heseltine, he has never disguised his
preference for pragmatism over ideology.
The lecture contained strong echoes also of the advocacy of a European-style
social market which Mr Chris Patten offered in an interview in Marxism Today
as long ago as January 1990.
But Mr Hunt's decision to recall the traditions of a one-nation,
pro-European Conservatism was only one piece in a jigsaw. After living in
the shadow of the recalcitrant Euro-sceptic right of the party at
Westminster, the social marketeers have decided to assert their authority.
With the end in sight of the Maastricht bill there is a new sense of
liberation.
Six weeks ago Mr Stephen Dorrell, still outside the cabinet but talked of as
a future leader, issued a sharp warning of the risks of 'dogmatic attachment
to market economics'. If Toryism meant high living standards and individual
choice, it also stood for social stability and evolutionary change.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, took up the same theme in a
recent newspaper article. Tories had to remember that the pursuit of low
inflation, privatisation and lower public spending were means rather than
ends.
But the pivotal change has been Mr Kenneth Clarke's move to the Treasury. A
self-styled member of the 'hard-centre', he has dispensed with the
monetarist rhetoric of policy-making during the 1980s.
Sure Mr Clarke wants low inflation, tight control of public spending and the
opportunity to cut taxes. But he has no desire to dismantle the welfare
state. He wants to listen to industrialists as well as City economists. The
language of pro-Europeanism and partnership has returned to the Treasury.
None of this presages a return to 1970s-style corporatism. Lady Thatcher
shifted the centre of gravity in politics. Many of those now proclaiming the
virtues of the social market would a decade ago have been judged to have
been on the right rather than the centre-left of the party.
Nor are they without enemies in the cabinet. Mr Michael Howard, Mr Michael
Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley and, most recently, Mr John Redwood, remain
faithful to a more liberal, individualistic creed. The government's slim
majority and Mr Major's weakened authority makes them a powerful force.
On the day Mr Major won the party leadership he turned to a friend in the
lobby of the Commons and proclaimed: 'We are in charge now. The party is in
our hands.' He was wrong. The right has fought a dogged rearguard battle.
But Mr Hunt and others are determined now to claim that victory.

Whoever deserves a plus mark in this summer's Advanced-level exams, it is
not the senior examiner responsible for a mathematics paper set by one of
the A-level boards: the Oxford University Delegacy of Local Examinations.
He included in the mechanics paper a complex problem requiring candidates to
prove, among other things, that a stone catapulted at a moving target would
hit its mark.
His own workings and checks showed that, handled properly, the information
given in the question yielded a quadratic equation which provided the
answer. The equation was:
4t2 - 8t + 5 = 0 But when the A-level candidates sat the problem last month,
the best equation any of them could derive from the data was:
4t2 - 8t - 5 = 0 which didn't yield any sort of answer at all.
The Oxford board's chagrin is all the worse because between the setting of
the problem in autumn 1991 and the exams 21 months later, the paper was
subjected to repeated checks in which it was scanned by numerous staff. 'We
thought our system was fool-proof,' said an official ruefully, 'but they can
obviously still get though.'
He's right. On Eddie George's first morning as Bank of England Governor he
was given a champagne send-off by the newsagent who supplies his FT, Bernie
Webb. In reporting the event, Observer - who attended without over-indulging
 -printed his surname as Kemp.
Apologies to Bernie, and heart-felt sympathy to the Oxford board.

Top US trade economist Jagdish Bhagwati had a professional answer when
questioned about his future with the international trade watch-dog, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
An eloquent and unflagging champion for free trade, he has long played a
quiet but important role as economic policy adviser to Gatt director-general
Arthur Dunkel. With his retirement after 13 years last week, however, the
adviser's present contract ended.
Would new director-general Peter Sutherland feel a need for the kind of
trade policy knowledge that his predecessor had so valued?, Bhagwati was
asked. 'There has been no demand, and until then there will be no supply,'
was his only comment.

One of the perks for some newspaper proprietors is being able to dictate
what goes in one's own newspapers.
So no surprise then that Lord Stevens of Ludgate used yesterday's Sunday
Express to issue a long personal statement correcting several 'highly
misleading articles' in rival newspapers criticising his chairmanship of
United Newspapers which is raising Pounds 190m via a rights issue.
'There has been no direct or indirect criticism' of his 12-year stewardship
of United, only quotes from anonymous fund managers, says Lord Stevens.
'Neither our merchant banks, nor our other advisers, have received any
complaints whatsoever.' Indeed, The Times and the Daily Mail both endorsed
his cash raising exercise, notes Lord Stevens.
That said, it would be surprising if there were not a few fund managers who
had some doubts about the wisdom of keeping Lord Stevens as United's
chairman given that the two other quoted companies he has been involved
with, Invesco MIM and Alexander Proudfoot, have both cut their dividends
over the last year.
A dignified silence would have been more appropriate.

Buy that man a drink. Nice to see that Christopher Morgan, Asil Nadir's
unpaid PR man, hasn't lost his sense of humour. Amid all the other calls he
had to field last week was one from surveyors Stirling Ackroyd, wondering if
Morgan's infamous overseas client might be interested in re-investing in the
London property market.
Although the investment in question was being handled by upmarket rivals
Richard Ellis, acting for a bank whose overseas client had gone bust, the
man from Stirling Ackroyd felt Morgan's client ought to be alerted to one of
the hottest properties currently on the market - 12-16 Elm Street, home of
the Serious Fraud Office.

As is shown by numerous courses for executives on how to manage their day
efficiently, time is a valuable resource. It can also have costly
implications, as deposed minister Michael Mates now knows all too well.
But in looking back on the watch that started the countdown to his
resignation, he can at least have the consolation of knowing it could have
cost him even more. Take the latest Grande Complication timepiece from Swiss
manufacturers Blancpain.
Platinum-cased, the watch's mechanical workings include 780 moving parts,
all hand-made, and took four years to perfect. Its six functions include a
perpetual calendar, a chronograph with a split second, a minute repeater,
and moon phase. Only 30 are to be produced at the rate of five a year. And
the price?
SF800,000 apiece although, on Friday night's exchange rates at any rate,
Pounds 351,650 or so would do.

BY OPPOSING change in the timing of News at Ten, the independent television
network's flagship news bulletin, the government may temporarily have
mollified its back benches. In doing so, however, it has highlighted growing
internal contradictions in what passes for Britain's broadcasting policy,
which cannot be resolved by a political quick fix.
The ITV companies want to shift News at Ten to an earlier prime time hour to
make way for programmes which will attract bigger audiences and advertising
revenues. It is hard to fault their logic, since the explicit purpose of the
government's reform of the ITV franchise system was to induce the companies
to behave more commercially.
The Independent Television Commission's objection that the proposed
programme change would violate the companies' licence obligations is tenuous
at best. The ITC asserts that, when bidding for franchises, several
indicated in their proposed programme schedules that they would keep News at
Ten at its traditional hour. But that was never a condition of the franchise
licences. By attempting to impose it now, the ITC seems to be suggesting it
can veto any departure by franchise-holders from their original schedules.
There are legitimate grounds for arguing that, television news, as the main
source of information for most of the population, occupies a special
position. Ideally, diversity and impartiality should be encouraged by free
competition. But if that cannot be achieved by the market, regulation - and
even some public funding - may be required. However, the sole aim of such
measures should be to safeguard the integrity and editorial independence of
news providers.
Regrettably, that does not appear to be main concern prompting the prime
minister and Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, to intervene publicly
in the News at Ten affair. Indeed, Mr Brooke's hint that the ITV companies
should back off if they want him to relax the current takeover restrictions
on them hints at potentially murkier motives.
The government cannot have it both ways. If Britain is to have a television
network that is genuinely commercial and independent, it must be allowed to
develop free from capricious regulation and political meddling. A new
framework is needed, which also takes account of the BBC and the growth of
alternative broadcasting channels. The longer the government delays
confronting that challenge, the more glaring will become the shortcomings of
its existing policies.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Advocate of active government: Philip Stephens on
soul-searching in the two main UK political parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith should be luxuriating in Mr John Major's misfortunes. It is
not often an opposition leader can count on a government to shoot itself in
the head. The last to do so with such unerring accuracy was the government
of the then Mr James Callaghan. That brought Mrs Margaret Thatcher to power
and the 14 years of Conservative rule of which Mr Major remains the
bene-ficiary.
But the Labour leader has less cause for celebration. If the government is a
shambles, the opposition has yet to show it can win the lasting affection of
an electorate angry with the Conservatives. The fear in too many Labour
minds is that while voters may be ready now to desert the government, in the
end they will prove once again to be strictly temporary converts.
A year on from his election as Labour leader Mr Smith is the target for
sniping at Westminster. The aggressive modernisers who want to replace
socialism with social democracy are impatient with his careful, studied
approach to change. The traditionalists accuse him of being too easily
pushed into betrayal of Labour's past.
More curiously he finds himself in bitter confrontation with the trade
unions which 12 months ago anointed him as Mr Neil Kinnock's successor. If
he loses his fight to weaken the unions' collective voice in party
decision-making his leadership will be severely compromised.
Mr Smith is unmoved. A self-assured Scottish advocate whose politics are
infused with a streak of Presbyterian moralism, he refuses to sweat in the
Westminster hothouse. Confident or complacent, he points to Labour's gains
in the county council elections in May (Labour is running Norfolk for the
first time in 103 years) and to its successes in exploiting Mr Major's
troubles with everything from the economy and Maastricht to Mr Asil Nadir
and party funding.
So he replies briskly to criticisms of a 'remote' style. 'They say that of
every leader.' Suggestions that Labour's message lacks resonance in the
country are brushed aside. 'I was elected to win the next election. That is
my overriding purpose. I try to think every day what I have done to advance
that purpose. And I will win the next election. There is no doubt about
that.' He insists he has set out with clarity the policy framework for that
election. The independent Social Justice Commission is to publish soon the
first comprehensive map of British society since the Beveridge Report 50
years ago. The national policy forum, which now steers policy-making, has
prepared detailed approaches to the economy, Europe and democracy.
But if there was a recurring theme during the interview - the 'big idea'
always demanded of politicians by political commentators - it was his
conviction that government can and must change things. 'The notion of the
government taking reponsibility is the key division between the political
parties.' Labour's guiding principle was simple. 'There is no dramatic
choice between prosperity and justice. The task of politics is to improve
our society. A strong economy and a fair society is my slogan.'
He began with an uncharacteristically passionate commitment to
constitutional change: Scottish and Welsh devolution, regional assemblies,
stronger local government, a bill of rights and freedom of information, a
purge of Whitehall quangos. 'Our constitution and our forms of government
have become antique and foolish. I really think we have to move from being
subjects of the Queen to citizens of a modern state.'
He was not (lest the tabloids take fright) talking about abolishing the
monarchy. But he believes the theory of the British constitution - based on
the sovereignty of the monarch in parliament - has prevented explicit
statements of the rights and obligations of citizens.
Parliament had become 'weak and ineffective'; the spawning in areas such as
health and education of a 'new magistracy' of officials appointed by
Whitehall was 'offensive to democracy'; local government had been
undermined.
Mr Smith wants pluralism. 'Decentralisation of government, a new style of
open government, systems that lead to more honest government.' This was not
simply a chattering classes issue. There is a moral undertone. 'There is a
great deal of unease in this country not just about our economic decline and
the social disintegration but also about the style and manner and purpose of
government.'
What then about electoral reform? The party's inquiry under Professor
Raymond Plant had called for a proportional voting system for the House of
Commons to put an end to the winner-takes-all principle in British politics.
Mr Smith rejected the Plant recommendation but has promised a referendum.
Political opportunism? He was unapologetic. A change in the voting system
would break the essential link between MP and constituency. 'You need to
have constituencies in the British political system. You cannot have two
classes of members, one without a constituency and one with.'
Nor did he want compromise government. 'Inevitably you end up with coalition
governments in which the tilt to left or right is decided by the middle
party. I can see why the Liberal Democrats are in favour of a system like
that because they would never be out of power.' But his promise of a
referendum was serious: 'I accept that this is an important debate which has
to be decided. I genuinely want a referendum, there will be one.'
One thing there would not be was any pre-election deal with Mr Paddy
Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats. 'We are not interested in
electoral pacts or electoral deals for the very simple reason that parties
do not own votes. I have no right to instruct Labour voters to vote in any
particular way.'
It is on the economy though that Mr Smith will stand or fall. He must shape
an economic policy that persuades a sceptical electorate he can be trusted
with their taxes.
The party has quietly abandoned the tax plans which cost it in 1992 the
pivotal support of southern England's aspiring classes. Nationalisation is
no longer a word that passes Labour lips. New spending commitments have been
outlawed. But even those who follow politics closely are unsure where Mr
Smith would strike a balance between the respective roles of markets and
states, between spending and taxes.
He disclaims the party's dirigiste past. It is no longer interested in state
ownership or planning, in spending for the sake of it or in soaking the
rich. But neither does it share the Tories' faith in markets.
Back to active government. 'We are defining what governments can do and what
markets can do. Let markets decide the price of potatoes but let them not
decide on access to education, health or on the shape of our training policy
because they can't do that.'
Government must act as catalyst for advance; investing in education,
training, science and technology. More public spending then? Yes. 'It's
investment and you have got to invest to get a rate of return.' Mr Smith
sees the trap; spending, he adds, will only rise as fast as the country can
afford. That will depend on stronger economic growth. But on the principle
of intervention he is unapologetic: 'Government must do the things that
without government intervention will not happen. That is not a dirigiste,
command-style economic policy.'
Nor does intervention mean direction from Whitehall. Just as political power
should be diffused to the regions so too should the government's role in
supporting industry. For Mr Smith the model is not the National Enterprise
Board of the 1960s but the Scottish Development Agency of the 1980s.
A long-term approach is the way forward. 'The most important thing about
economic policy is to get away from short-termism which is the endemic
British disease and a very strong feature of Conservative government.' As
for his tax plans they will be spelt out only much closer to the election.
They will be fair but not penal.
All this though will be irrelevant if Mr Smith loses his conference showdown
over party democracy with those erstwhile allies Mr John Edmunds and Mr Bill
Morris. Mr Smith has staked out a position on the issue of
one-member-one-vote which most of the unions have flatly rejected. On the
present arithmetic he would lose the vote at conference. Someone has to
blink. Mr Smith says it will not be him. 'I will fight on. My argument is
right. I will maintain it.' Quite simply he cannot afford to lose.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Euro retreat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT decision to put the European Community's liberalising directive
on pension fund investment into bureaucratic limbo may not be the most
significant retreat to date from the European ideal. But it is still
important since it perpetuates a series of distortions in the EC capital
markets arising from artificial restrictions on investment in different
classes of assets and currencies. Coming after the turmoil in the Exchange
Rate Mechanism, it appears in effect to put an end to the prospect of a
single EC capital market for the foreseeable future.
There is no economic logic in the decision to shunt the matter back to a
working party. Portfolio theory has established beyond reasonable doubt the
benefits of diversification. These are more than sufficient to off-set
exchange rate risk. The political logic, in contrast, is clear. The chief
beneficiary of the status quo is big government, which will retain the
right, in certain countries, to finance growing budget deficits from captive
institutional money at artificially low interest rates. As the practice of
funding occupational pensions catches on in continental Europe to help
reduce the strain on public finances of ageing populations, less of the
management will find its way to efficient hands in London or Zurich.
The losers are Europe's pensioners, who will receive lower returns for any
given degree of risk. While rich investors exploit the freedom to invest
globally that comes from the abolition of exchange controls around the
Single Market, poor to middle-income people whose savings are managed by
institutions will suffer relative disadvantage. Companies in countries with
restrictions that push investors towards government bonds may suffer from a
higher cost of capital than otherwise. Everyone loses, in the sense that the
benefits to the European economy of an efficient, integrated EC capital
market are being thrown away.
Though the arguments appear technical, there is a wider symbolism. If the EC
opts for protectionism in an area where the political cost of liberalisation
is so paltry, how will it avoid a retreat into economic nationalism on
larger issues? The prognosis is poor.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Letter: Smokescreen surrounds UK's objective of resuming
nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr SEAN HOWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, All indications are that President Bill Clinton will shortly announce
an extension of the US moratorium on nuclear testing. Britain uses the US
site in Nevada, and cannot test unless the Americans lift their ban. The
decision the president looks set to make would be a heavy defeat for the
British government, which has been lobbying fiercely for a resumption of
tests.
There is a widespread misconception that Britain wants to test to make sure
that its existing nuclear weapons are safe and reliable. This misconception
has been deliberately fostered by British officials in Washington. However,
if parliamentary answers by government ministers are to be believed, Britain
does not need to test Polaris, the WE177 free-fall bomb or Trident for
safety or reliability.
On November 30 1992 Viscount Cranborne said: 'We are concerned purely with
the safety of future systems.' On October 23 1992, armed forces minister
Archie Hamilton, asked what the moratorium would mean for Trident, stated:
'There are no implications for the Trident warhead programme, the tests for
which have been completed.'
In fact, there are safety worries about British nuclear weapons, but they
could all be rectified without a single nuclear test, by changing
operational procedures. Safety is used as a smokescreen to obscure the real
purpose of tests. Recent reports in Washington suggest that Britain wanted
to test a replacement warhead for the WE177.
British weapons development tests would have caused a storm of protest on
Capitol Hill, in this country and elsewhere. It seems that once it became
clear that its safety and reliability cover had been blown, the government
concluded that the game was up and withdrew its plans to test.
The government will doubtless now proclaim itself as world leader in the
fight against nuclear proliferation.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Letter: Safety and security issues no argument against gas
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BRYANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Cedric Brown of British Gas (Letters, June 30) is right to say that
there must be no compromise on the issue of safety and security of supply in
introducing fair competition into the domestic gas market. However, these
important issues should not be used as an argument to block the introduction
of competition, but rather to frame necessary high standards of service to
which those companies wishing to supply the domestic consumer must adhere.
In submissions to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by ourselves and
several associated energy utilities we also stressed the need for safety and
security of supply. We advocated retaining a single transportation company
and a separate storage company. This combination would permit clear and
transparent charging of services to all users, including British Gas's
marketing operations. It would also facilitate the maintenance of the same
standards of safety and security of supply as customers currently enjoy.
We stand by our belief that the new domestic gas suppliers should be allowed
to compete on a fair and equal basis with British Gas and must be prepared
to share fully in the social obligations that the Gas Act currently vests
solely with British Gas.
Further, the creation of a new and comprehensive public gas supplier licence
will lay to rest once and for all British Gas's arguments over independents
'cherry picking' more lucrative customers and effectively ignoring the needs
of the socially disadvantaged. We do not disagree with Ruth Evans of the
National Consumer Council (Letters, July 1) that competition must prove its
worth before regulation can be relaxed; indeed we espouse the phased
introduction of competition in the domestic market to ensure that consumer
interests are fully respected.
The introduction of competition into other privatised monopolies has brought
benefits in both price and standards of service to domestic consumers. In
the case of gas, British Gas admits that, of the 25,000 firm
industrial/commercial contract gas users now able to enjoy competition, more
than 50 per cent have chosen to leave British Gas in favour of competitive
supply. How long must the 18m UK domestic gas customers wait before they can
enjoy the same freedom of choice?

FT  05 JUL 93 / Home, costly home: John Willman on a risk to private
investment in UK housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finding ways of raising private finance to fund public expenditure is one of
the UK government's priorities, as it struggles to contain this year's
Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement.
Yet plans to cut grants to housing associations could reduce the
availability of private finance for the government's housing programme, says
the cross-party House of Commons environment select committee in a report to
be published tomorrow.
Housing associations have provided a model example of how private capital
can be used to finance public spending. Associations build more than 50,000
homes for rent each year, by combining Pounds 2bn a year of government
grants with Pounds 1bn of private finance raised on the capital markets.
However, the select committee warns that cuts in housing association grants
would make it much harder for associations to borrow the money they need,
and may deter private investors from lending to them.
The grant cuts were announced in last year's Autumn Statement, when the
chancellor provided Pounds 700m to remove 20,000 homes from the housing
market. The money for his housing market package came from the budget of the
Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes grants to housing
associations.
The chancellor was quick to promise that the cut in the corporation's budget
would mean no reduction in the 153,000 new housing association homes
promised for the next three years in the Conservative election manifesto.
Instead, the level of grant would fall from an average of 72 per cent of the
cost of each new home last year to 55 per cent in 1995-96.
The housing associations would therefore be forced to raise 45 per cent of
the cost of new homes from the capital markets, rather than 28 per cent.
In order to pay the additional interest, they are likely to have to raise
rents. This is in spite of the fact that the chancellor said in his Autumn
Statement that the steady fall in interest rates, combined with lower land
prices and building costs in the aftermath of the recession, ought to
counteract any need for a steep rise in rents.
The announcement caused consternation at the Housing Corporation, which had
recommended no change in the grant rates. It predicted that investors would
not be prepared to lend housing associations such a high proportion of the
cost of a new building against the security of a tenanted home, which is
normally valued at 50 per cent of its vacant value.
In the short term, associations could pledge their older property as
additional security for loans. But, eventually, even that source of asset
cover would be used up.
And there would be very little additional security available for newer
housing associations or the small associations that cater for the needs of
special groups such as single people and ethnic minorities. This would
inevitably reduce the diversity of accommodation offered by housing
associations - one of their most attractive features, in contrast with the
monolithic housing estates built by local authorities.
'The problem of asset cover is surmountable as long as grant levels stay
above around 60 per cent,' according to Mr Maurice Hochschild, associate
director of European Capital, a merchant banking firm which advises on
housing association fund-raising. 'But if the average grant falls to 55 per
cent, there will sooner or later be problems in finding sufficient security
for loans.'
There is an additional threat to lenders, however: lower grant rates could
make it harder for associations to service debt.
Projections carried out for the National Federation of Housing Associations
by stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew suggest that, despite lower interest
rates and building costs, rents would have to rise by 75 per cent over the
next three years to meet the cost of raising a higher proportion of private
finance.
'That would raise rents to almost 40 per cent of the average income of
working households,' says Mr Jim Coulter, director of the NFHA. 'With rents
at such levels, 89 per cent of new tenants would qualify for housing
benefit.' That compares with half of new tenants qualifying now.
'Many more housing association tenants would find themselves stuck in the
poverty trap, where almost all of any increase in income is clawed back in
taxes and reductions in means-tested benefits,' says Mr Coulter.
More worrying for lenders, however, are the implications of such reliance on
housing benefit for the rent payments to service their loans. The cost to
the exchequer of housing benefit is rising fast, at more than 10 per cent
annually, and will reach almost Pounds 10bn this year. With housing benefit
already under close scrutiny as part of the Treasury's long-term review of
social security spending, further large increases could persuade the
government to consider cutting it.
'Any cuts in housing benefit could make it harder for housing associations
to collect rent and to service their loans,' says Mr Hochschild. 'The
dependence on social security benefits which could be vulnerable to
government cuts in the future may make investors cautious.'
Thus the government could find that reducing the grant paid to housing
associations not only boosts the social security bill, it also makes
investors less willing to lend associations the private finance they need.
'That would be a pity,' says the NFHA's Mr Coulter. 'Housing associations
have been very successful at raising private finance to supplement public
expenditure on housing.'
It would certainly be strange for the government to put that success at risk
at a time when it is looking for private finance to fund other parts of the
public expenditure programme. The government's response to the select
committee's report will be vital in convincing many in the City that it is
serious about wishing to work in partnership with private investors in
financing public expenditure.

FT  05 JUL 93 / From the brake to the accelerator: The French premier is
facing a rising tide of grim economic news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the time of his appointment, Mr Edouard Balladur was supposed to be
economically effective and politically low key. But in his first three
months as France's prime minister, he has proved to be neither.
The economy has continued to sink. Unemployment rose in May to a record 11.5
per cent, and, among leading indicators, housing starts have continued to
fall. His stewardship has, of course, been too brief for him to be fairly
blamed for the state of the economy. But on taking office, Mr Balladur
underestimated the seriousness of recession, and since then has been
shifting his foot from the fiscal brake to the fiscal accelerator. Neither
he nor his ministers have been able to point to any upturn.
At the same time, both the conservative prime minister and Mr Francois
Mitterrand, the Socialist president, are rising in the opinion polls. The
French seem to appreciate the fact that the two get on well together.
Evidence of this was Mr Balladur's readiness to let Mr Mitterrand lead the
French delegation at this week's G7 summit in Tokyo while he pushes through
a legislative programme at home, including bills for privatisation and Bank
of France independence.
The leaders of France's governing coalition parties - Mr Jacques Chirac of
the RPR Gaullists and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the UDF centre-right -
had counted on Mr Balladur to quickly put the economy to rights (without
acquiring the sort of political profile that might challenge their own
ambitions to the Elysee in the 1995 presidential elections).
Mr Balladur seems unnerved. He is having to watch his back and front. At his
back, he has restive members of his own RPR party. Forty of them deserted
him on the bill making the Bank of France independent, while the view of a
larger number has been voiced by Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly
president, who has warned the government risks 'a social Munich' by
surrendering hard-won welfare rights in the fight against unemployment.
From the centre-right, has come the recommendation from Mr Raymond Barre
that the government should bend to recession and follow a 'more flexible'
budgetary policy - giving greater priority to unemployment than to the
budget deficit.
As if the sniping within government were not enough, Mr Balladur's problems
outside cabinet are much more pressing. Some 3.1m are unemployed. The PM has
no way of knowing how much higher the jobless figure can go without risking
social unrest.
Particularly chilling were the words last month of Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, industry minister in the last Socialist government. He said
the government 'has no chance of success (in fighting unemployment) because
it is roughly following the same policy as we did'. He was referring to the
fact that Mr Balladur had done little more in his first budget on May 10
than reinforce the budgetary rigor on which the late Mr Pierre Beregovoy -
Mr Balladur's predecessor - prided himself.
The Balladur One budget involved cutting the 1993 budget deficit from
FFr333bn (Pounds 38.81bn) to FFr317bn, by making FFr21.5bn in cuts and
raising an extra FFr7.7bn in taxes.
But it produced a backbench revolt in the governing parties because its net
effect looked likely to depress the economy. Two weeks later, Balladur Two
was unveiled. The centrepiece of this is a FFr40bn bond issue, to be covered
by the proceeds of privatisation this autumn. Much of the state borrowing
would go to expand the temporary work schemes which the Socialists had
developed.
Mr Balladur is still calling on people to be patient for results. 'When I
hear people say they will judge our policy in September, they are talking
nonsense because our measures will only have been in effect for a week or
two by then,' he scolded recently. But it is now clear that he is no longer
in a position to bank on the patience of his countrymen. Last week he said
he would in September propose personal tax cuts in a reflationary package
which will also include larger depreciation allowances for companies to
boost investment. France will then have Balladur Three.
Officially, the government has committed itself to a five-year plan to
reduce the budget deficit from the equivalent of 4.4 per cent of gross
domestic product this year, to 4 per cent next year and to 2.5 per cent by
1997. This last target is largely political, because it would put France
within the Maastricht treaty convergence limits just in time for it to be
eligible for the European Community's first stab at monetary union.
Reducing next year's budget deficit to FFr300bn is not impossible given some
growth after this year's contraction in the economy. But if it is not
achievable, there will be little dismay in a government which, apart from
perhaps Mr Balladur himself and his loyal budget minister, Mr Nicolas
Sarkozy, is more worried about recovery than book-balancing.
Gaullists have always been more concerned about social welfare than, say,
today's British Conservatives, while the UDF minister responsible for small
business, Mr Alain Madelin, is one of France's very few genuine economic
liberals. He argues, and to good effect in Mr Balladur's ear, that France's
whole crisis started with investment being cut in 1991-92, and that the
crisis will end only when investment picks up. Given that interest rate
levels are still constrained by Germany's monetary stance, the next best
thing the government can do to revive the key intermediate capital goods
sector is to lower other charges, notably fiscal, on industry.
In fact, the German monetary constraint on France has diminished. Since
April, France has cut its interest rates 10 times, and only on two occasions
has it waited for the Bundesbank to act first.
If France's inflation remains lower than Germany's and its growth prospects
less miserable than Germany's, and if Germany refuses (as is likely) to
devalue the D-Mark against the franc, then the French currency would remain
conveniently undervalued against German money. This would help French trade,
at least across the Rhine.
But France's record FFr16.2bn trade surplus in the first quarter of this
year (triple the surplus in the same period of 1992) mainly reflects
recession at home, with the fall in imports outpacing that in exports. There
is nothing in it to give France the self-confidence that would change its
attitude to talks aimed at reaching a new General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
If anything, this attitude has got tougher and more precise. Initially Mr
Balladur did not seem to know where he was going. Explaining why he had
three times refused Mr Balladur's offer of the agricultural portfolio, Mr
Charles Millon, the UDF parliamentary leader, said: 'I never managed to
discover what policy he wanted me to adopt.' Eventually, Mr Balladur decided
to accept an EC accord with the US on oilseeds production, but to fight
Washington, and the rest of the EC if need be, on other farm trade issues.
Mr Balladur is right in claiming that Gatt is a test of the EC's identity.
If the 12 were now to come apart on trade, then Maastricht and all its
pledges of European unity would mean little.
The prime minister is therefore taking a gamble with France's investment in
Europe. In doing so, he has particular need of Mr Mitterrand's support,
especially in light of the president's rapport with Helmut Kohl. That
dependence on the Socialist president may yet come to haunt Mr Balladur's
fellow conservatives.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Letter: Help computer sector by scrapping tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G S SHINGLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Decisions are about to be taken behind closed doors in various foreign
capitals which will have a serious effect on thousands of jobs in the
computer industry of Britain and other EC member states.
I refer to the decisions on whether or not to remove the high level of
tariff and duties which apply to most semiconductors (14 per cent) and
computer parts (4-6 per cent) imported from outside the EC. I would like to
draw your attention to the following points:
Digital alone employs about 7,000 people in the UK (and about 30,000 in the
EC as a whole). Seventy per cent of its integrated computer systems plant in
Scotland is exported to the rest of the EC.
Digital is not alone. Hundreds of thousands of other jobs depend on the
European production and sales of companies such as IBM, Unisys, Compaq,
Apple, Intel and many more.
The computer industry is vital to Britain and Europe's future, yet it is
competing with one hand tied behind its back. Our competitors in Japan, the
US and Canada have abolished duties on computer parts and semiconductors and
can therefore source these items duty free from anywhere in the world. We
cannot.
Digital wishes to expand its UK operations to serve the EC and global market
from the UK. We have made enormous investments in manufacturing capacity to
this end. Our ability to manufacture is substantially impaired by tariffs
which distort our sourcing and limit our ability to compete.
The duties are protectionist serving only to protect the narrow vested
interests of certain component makers and 'board staffers' in France,
Germany and Holland.
Protectionism is not the answer. It only plays into the hands of our
competitors. Eliminating the duties will strengthen the computer industry in
the UK and the EC, creating jobs, encouraging investment and creating export
opportunities.
The EC is looking to trade off a reduction in duties on computer parts and
semiconductors for American 'concessions' in other areas (such as textiles)
 -concessions which may, or many not, be forthcoming. The competitiveness of
our sunrise industries is too important to be played with in this way. It is
in the UK and the EC's own interest to abolish the duties now - a point
recognised years ago by our competitors in the US, Japan and Canada.
Time is running out. A deal may be done on the fringes of the Group of Seven
discussions in Tokyo as early as tomorrow. I call upon the European
Commission, the British government and its partners in the EC to look to the
real interests of the European computer industry as a whole. Eliminate
computer parts tariffs now: don't gamble with the future of this vital
sunrise industry and the manufacturing jobs within it.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Arts: Prince's pupils return to basics - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to believe the place has existed for only one year. How can such
richness, variety and intelligence have been gathered and organised in such
a short time? I recommend the end-of-year show of the Prince of Wales's
Institute of Architecture to any reader who has a few hours to spare. This
well-designed exhibition is open this week at the home of the new school,
14-15 Gloucester Gate, London NW1.
I have had an interest in the establishment of this alternative school of
architecture but no direct input into the teaching programme, and so I feel
I can offer the reader an inside view while looking critically at the
product of the first year's teaching. The unusual thing about this new
school is that it was set up by the Prince of Wales as a home for a radical
and completely alternative way of teaching architecture. The Prince, and
others, recognised a need to found a school that would be a catalytic
meeting point for students and teachers where a true journey of exploration
into the richness of art and architecture could begin.
On show this week is the work of the first 28 foundation course students.
The full title of their programme is 'Foundation Course in Architecture and
the Building Arts' and it is unique in Britain. Not many schools of
architecture begin their first term with a lecture from Sir Laurens van der
Post that describes all humans as being builders at heart.
His point, that we have lost the capacity in many of our buildings to
reflect our own values, is well worth making. In the modern visual world,
'we look for a reflection of ourselves but see none, listen for an echo of
our values but hear nothing'. The Prince's school aims to return building to
the realm of common sense in a way that does not fragment and separate the
various building processes.
This is a large agenda but an impressive start has been made in the first
year. Students are pushed very hard. To emphasise the holistic nature of
building creation, they all study life drawing, painting, drawing from
nature, modelling in clay and carving in stone. These are seen as basic ways
of learning to see and measure and of beginning to understand materials.
One exhibition, of a group of clay modelled heads set against a display of
bamboos, is very touching and beautiful. There are some excellent plant
drawings and some good figure drawings. Use of washes and water colours has
been well absorbed - however the oil painting has some way to go. Once these
representational arts are mastered, the student moves rapidly into project
work and design.
Looking at nature and the life model is important because it grounds the
students' visual experience in a knowledge of proportion and structure.
Students follow simultaneously a course in architectural history which
emphasises that architects are guardians of a great heritage existing as a
source of inspiration. When the modern movement in architecture tried to
kill history it only revealed the poverty of its own powers of invention.
History is evident in the students' work not in the form of slavish
imitation but as a clear inspiration. They do learn to draw the classical
orders but simply, as we all should, as part of any civilised person's
knowledge.
I was impressed by the community projects that the students had undertaken
in four places in London and in Salisbury. It is absolutely essential for
students to understand the planning process if they are to tackle areas like
Hulme in Manchester - one of the most deprived and difficult inner city
areas in the country.
One student project has already achieved a concrete result. The derelict
pier at Nine Elms in Wandsworth is to be saved as a result of a discussion
process and development study that was instigated by the institute. One
particular student - Ivan Kniazev from St Petersburg - made a spectacular
and practical contribution to the problem of the derelict pier. He produced
a magnificent drawing of his idea to convert the pier into a ship for all
kinds of public activities.
The students have so won the hearts of Wandsworth's planners that they are
to make a presentation concerning all of the borough's riparian land. This
presentation, 'London's Liquid Asset', will take place on a Hydrocat (the
latest river bus) with the head of planning and the mayor of Wandsworth on
board.
Another practical link between the institute and the world outside involves
the Macmillan cancer nursing scheme. The Macmillan Design Challenge awards
will be shown at the institute on July 22.
It is impressive that such a young school should be having such an impact
and it is encouraging. From this autumns, the institute will take graduate
students on courses that are recognised by the Royal Institute of British
Architects; bridges are being built between the profession and one of its
sternest critics.
Even the most entrenched old-fashioned Modernist could not fail to be fired
by the enthusiasm and breadth of the Prince of Wales's Institute of
Architecture. Its diet is too rich to be dogmatic and too questioning of
fundamentals to be other than constructive. It clearly has a bright future.
End-of-year show until July 9. 10am-5pm (until 8pm Weds) Prince of Wales's
Institute of Architecture, NW1

Brian Friel's new play is something of a puzzler, a product of the writer's
mystic side, which was only hinted at in his previous success, Dancing at
Lughnasa. It has none of the warm nostalgic glow that formed such a strong
part of Lughnasa's appeal, nor its manic, life asserting energy. It is set
firmly in the present day with three rather ordinary middle class couples as
protagonists.
A cynic could describe the play as six characters going nowhere. A romantic
would say that it is all about the healing power of the irrational, the
elemental and the wonderful which are generally missing from modern life.
It takes place on a stone pier in a remote part of Donegal (Ballybeg again)
where the six wait for a boatman to take them across to the island. He never
shows up. After an uncomfortable, sometimes drunken, night, they are
collected again by their minibus driver.
Joe Vanek's set consists of a solid looking narrow stone pier which crosses
the middle of the state and has 'water' in front, behind and at one end. As
the 'misty' white drape is pulled off the set you can hear the waves lapping
and the cries of gulls. The arrival of the trippers with their banal,
unsober songs and jokes, destroys this illusion of peace.
At first we are beguiled into believing that we are watching a realistic
play about the amiable bookmaker, Terry, his wife, Derna, her sister and
husband and Terry's sister and husband reacting to the dis-comfort of an
outing gone wrong.
But there is of course far more to it than that. The name of the island that
the party cannot reach, for example, translates from the Irish as 'Island of
Otherness, Island of Mystery'. Soon after arriving at the pier Terry makes
everyone take off their shoes, to conform to the old custom observed when
the island was a place of pilgrimage.
As their long night wears on, the three couples find themselves
unconsciously conforming to the originally pagan rites of the pilgrimage.
Stones are built up into a cairn, tokens are hung on the lifebuoy's wooden
stand; there is music, dancing, story telling, drinking and eventually
visions. At the end they resolve to return next year, and every year after,
'to attest, to affirm, to acknowledge'.
The cast, under the direction of Patrick Mason, are uniformly strong, but
the constraints of the narrow horizontal set combined with the fragmented
nature of most of the dialogue seems to impede any development of character.
Donal McCann's Terry remains enigmatic: was the outcome of his birthday
outing premeditated, or were the strange events of their night on the pier
merely accidental?
Robert Black, an accordion player making his acting debut, brings a quiet
poignancy to the part of George who is dying of throat cancer and
communicates chiefly by playing tunes. Ingrid Craigie is alternately fragile
and strong as Gerry's mentally unstable wife. Marion O'Dwyer and Catherine
Byrne make the best of characters who struck me as predictably 'Frielsian',
the latter earthy, sexy and intuitive, the former one of those plain bovine
salt-of-the-earth women who seem to abound in Ballybeg.
Perhaps the characters fail to engage much interest because, in spite of the
efforts that Friel makes to disguise the fact, this is essentially a play of
ideas. For all the accomplished artistry, the memorable story telling, the
jokes and the evocative tunes, its plea for the power of the lost rituals of
the distant past failed to ignite any latent spark of paganism in this
witness.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Arts: Berkeley's Jungle Tale - Cheltenham Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 49th Cheltenham Festival, its programmes looking more chipper and
enterprising than they have for the best part of 20 years, opened on
Saturday with the premiere of Michael Berkeley's first opera. Baa Baa Black
Sheep was commissioned by the festival and staged by Opera North, which will
take Jonathan Moore's production into its main season in the autumn. It is
an ambitious, challenging work to a very fine libretto by David Malouf, with
a dramatic consistency which is only finally undermined by the unevenness of
the music.
The subject is a wonderfully potent one. At the age of 23 Rudyard Kipling
wrote a short story 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' about Punch, a six-year-old born
in India of English parents who is shipped back to England with his sister
Judy to be educated 'to be English'. For five years they are entrusted to
the manic Auntirosa and her House of Desolation, where Punch suffers
constant abuse and humiliation, from which there seems no deliverance. Only
in old age was Kipling able to admit that the bleak story was
autobiographical, that these were his own experiences as a schoolboy in
England and they had marked him indelibly.
In Kipling's story Punch cannot find a way to revenge himself for the
beatings and bullying he suffers from Auntirosa and her teenage son; he is
too young, too weak, to carry out the murder he craves. In the libretto
Malouf's imaginative leap has fused this tale with episodes from the Jungle
Books, identifying Mowgli as Punch's alter ego, and so providing the boy
through fantasy with that outlet for violent justice. The parallels fall
beautifully into place - Auntirosa is Baldeo the white hunter, her husband,
a mild, sympathetic Sea Captain, is Akela; Harry equates to Sheer Khan, the
tiger over whom Mowgli eventually triumphs; Punch's family are the Wolves,
and the three Indian retainers whom Punch has left behind become Baloo,
Bagheera and Ka.
There is nothing cosy, no Disney anthropomorphism about the jungle scenes;
the success of the scenario, Berkeley's music and Moore's production is to
make Mowgli's power struggles and his efforts to win acceptance just as real
and unsentimental as the depiction of Punch's desolate existence. And by
presenting these two Kipling worlds as congruent and interlinked, Baa Baa
Black Sheep adds yet another layer to its teasing allusive mixture.
Berkeley's score is equally rich and dense, the vocal lines rewarding and
his orchestral writing full of busy, muscular detail. The musical language
is homegrown, derived generously from Britten with occasional Tippett-like
touches (from The Vision of St Augustine, unfashionably). Though there is a
roughness, an almost expressionist edge to some of the writing that is
Berkeley's own, the obvious origins of those gestures finally prove too
distracting. It is hard to resist a mental tick-list of the sources as they
swell and fade - ensemble writing from Peter Grimes, lean, exposed
instrumental writing and (inevitable, perhaps) the writing for the treble
Punch from Turn of the Screw, a sudden baleful upwelling from War Requiem
and so on.
More intriguing, though, are the gamelan sonorities, sourced from Death in
Venice, which infiltrate the textures and represent the memories of India
that Punch has to struggle so hard to preserve. There are no quotation marks
around these, and as they add weight and washes of colour to the orchestral
sound they offer an aural equivalent to the multilayering and ambiguities of
the text.
Moore's production and David Blight's designs (some inappropriate palm trees
apart) are intelligent and effective, with the transformations from
Victorian England to fantasy India well managed; Paul Daniel realises and
releases the energy of Berkeley's music with an intensity that never
falters. The singing too is first rate: Malcolm Lorimer sings the demanding
parts of the Punch and the boy Mowgli with undaunted precision and presence;
the baritone William Dazeley makes Mowgli the young man exactly the potent,
semi-heroic figure the role demands.
Fiona Kimm adds Auntirosa to her gallery of sharply characterised
eccentrics; Philip Sheffield makes Harry a gruesome caricature, Ann
Taylor-Morley copes well with both the unrewarding part of Judy and the much
more interesting and sexy one of Grey Wolf. Among the roster of family and
other animals Clive Bayley's lucid, eloquent Bagheera and Eileen Hulse's
anguished Mother deserve special mention. Whatever the imperfections it is a
fascinating evening.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Arts: Swan Lake at the Coliseum - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the disappointments of Romeo and Juliet which opened the Kirov Ballet
season, it is good to report that the company is grandly itself again with
its second offering, Swan Lake. This Petersburg staging is the best in the
world. It is made for grown-ups by grown-ups. It plays no tricks, offers
neither gratuitous psychological insights nor optimistic reassessments of
score or text.
It understands that the way in which, a century ago, Petipa rescued and
re-ordered the original and ungainly score (three stagings in Moscow,
between 1877 and 1882, did not succeed) was wise and theatrically vital. It
has, across its years in Petersburg, been edited by several producers, yet
each appreciated the values of Petipa's version, and incidental vagaries
have been excised or muted. What we see now is Swan Lake as rite as well as
national treasure.
The production enshrines attitudes about classic dancing, about how a lyric
tragedy may be expressed within the terms of the academic vocabulary, which
are true, and unassailably right. And, unlike almost every other version,
this Swan Lake is of unfailing theatrical power. Igor Ivanov's sets provide
ideal - because poetic but unemphatic - locations. Galina Solovyova's
costumes have been revised for this season and are handsome, opulent. (The
expensive programme book, by the way, credits neither of these artists).
Within this framework, the grandeur of Kirov dance style gives the
choreography immense lustre. The general dances of the first and third
scenes are aristocratic because the dancers' training is itself noble. The
impeccable ranks of swans are a symbol of Tchaikovsky's vision of bewitched
maidens, and of ballet's metaphoric transmutation of women into dance forms.
And the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra - under Viktor Fedotov and Boris Gruzin
in two performances as the week ended - plays with absolute commitment,
absolute conviction.
This is, as I have suggested, a Swan Lake for adults, for people who care
about Swan Lake as a masterpiece to be honoured, and not just a catch-penny
attraction, all title and no sense. It is sure in its momentum, refined in
its means. (A comparison with the Royal Ballet's staging - which has a more
'authentic' text - shows how we mistrust the ballet, tricking it out with
egregious incident, clouding its dance and its larger meaning). And the
Kirov perform with such distinction that even mannerism and dullness, which
were the respective contributions of Yulia Makhalina and Alexander Kurkov in
the leading roles on Friday night, are absorbed into the general eloquence
of the presentation.
Makhalina, beautiful, strong and emphatic in technique, offered a reading of
Odette/Odile that looked extreme in physical outline and self-absorbed.
Certainly Kurkov is a paste-board Siegfried, but Makhalina's style - with
over-wrought tempi, hectic accents, tragedy queen manners - brought little
to the ballet. On Saturday afternoon Irma Nioradze was a tender Odette, the
dance elegant, and a lustrous Odile. Her Siegfried was Alexander Gulyayev,
who has a lively dramatic presence - the first act was well played in its
charm and eagerness - and a neat, if not gaudy, technique for the ball-room
endurance test. But I wish the Kirov would not treat the coda to the great
pas de deux as if it were a pentathlon, with breaks for applause after every
trick. Pierina Legnani expected such acclaim in Swan Lake in 1895 after her
fouettes. We have progressed a little - if not enough - since then.
A note in passing. The management owes it to the public to identify cast
changes. The first act trio on Saturday afternoon was entirely different
from that printed in the cast-list, and the audience was not informed. There
were also changes on Friday night which went unmarked. Courtesy to dancers
and public alike requires that changes be announced.
The Kirov Ballet is at The Coliseum with varied programmes until July 31.

For those satiated with pock, pock, thirtay, fortay, the Tour de France
offers wonderful relief: a long-distance bicycle race, ridden in teams,
where strategy is more important than tactics, and stamina more significant
than technique, it could hardly contrast more vividly with Wimbledon.
Channel 4's pillion coverage, helicopter shots, analysis and background is
usually spot on (8.30).
'Sharing the experience of being face to face with a rare animal wins
people's hearts for conservation,' we are assured by the makers of In The
Wild. Timothy Dalton (one of Sean Connery's locums in the Bond movies) sets
out to find a wild North American wolf. He flies to Alaska, meets eskimo
hunters, fails to see a wolf, but finally, 1,000 miles into the Arctic,
comes across an entire pack (9.00 ITV).
Panorama considers the pickle that the Roman Catholic Church finds itself in
now that so many priests are leaving to get married, fathering children
without leaving, or becoming involved in a variety of other scandals (9.30
BBC1). The Last Laugh is a tribute to the late Les Dawson, a standup
comedian capable of poetry (10.10 BBC1).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 16 offices that make up the UK regional network of Trafalgar House
Construction have won new orders worth Pounds 90m in the first six months of
this year.
That sum comprises 121 contracts encompassing all types of building and
civil engineering work.
The largest single order is represented by a Pounds 6.3m two year contract
from British Telecom for extensive underground work in Nottinghamshire and
Derbyshire.
That will involve installing ducting in highways, footpaths and other sites
in order that telephone and computer services may be provided to new housing
estates, offices and diverse other developments.
In Scotland, two civil engineering contracts worth Pounds 4.7m, for a
wastewater treatment plant on Tayside and a sewage treatment plant at Airth,
have been secured.
Building work includes a Pounds 3.2m contract for a new arts &amp; social
science block at Leicester University containing lecture theatres, seminar
and computing rooms which will provide space for 850 students and 160 staff.
Other significant building orders secured by Trafalgar include a Pounds 2.9m
design and construct contract for a new leisure centre at Herne Bay and a
Pounds 2.5m contract to refurbish Her Majesty's Prison Stafford.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trevor Truman, a well-known behind-the-scenes figure in the European defence
industry, has landed a high profile job with his appointment as director of
engineering at British Aerospace. Truman took up the new post last week,
replacing Ian Hall who has retired.
The new engineering chief is less well known to the public and BAe
shareholders than he is in defence and aerospace circles. He is a member of
the Defence Scientific Advisory Council, a council member of the Defence
Manufacturers Association, technical board member of the Society of British
Aerospace Companies and director of the European Defence Industry Group. He
is also a member of the UK delegation to the Nato Industrial Advisory Group.
Truman, 53, was educated at King's College, London University, and joined
Royal Ordnance in 1967 from the Ministry of Defence. In the mid 1980's he
was successively director for organisation and planning, managing director
of the explosives division, and operations director.
In 1987, he became a member of the board of Royal Ordnance after the company
was bought by British Aerospace. In 1988 he became chairman of Royal
Ordnance Speciality Metals and engineering director of Royal Ordnance.
He joined the board of British Aerospace Defence last year and will continue
as engineering director there concurrently with his new post, which is not a
main board appointment.

Hodder Headline, the new publisher formed out of a merger of Headline Book
Publishing with Hodder &amp; Stoughton, is hiring 37-year-old Martin Neild, key
accounts director of Pan Macmillan, to run its largest division, fiction and
non-fiction books.
He replaces Michael Attenborough, brother of the chairman of the old Hodder
&amp; Stoughton, and great great grandson of that company's founder Matthew
Hodder. Attenborough, 53, who has been at the company for 30 years, counts
John Le Carre among his authors.
Tim Hely Hutchinson, managing director of Headline, said that Attenborough
had been 'thinking about his future' and had decided to retire in October
1994, a decision Hely Hutchinson acknowledges had been 'crystallised' by the
merger.
'Neild is very well read, very numerate and very well known. In my view he
is the best marketing executive in the whole industry. He was my first and
only choice' says his new boss, singling out the success with Scarlett,
sequel to Gone with the Wind. 'He made an international best seller out of a
book that the reviewers could have been expected to be sniffy about.'
At Pan Macmillan his authors had included Ken Follett and Wilbur Smith.
Hely Hutchinson also worked for Macmillan. Neild succeeded him in the
Australian office, but the two did not meet. 'We were always on opposite
sides of the globe.'

Bernard Thiolon, recently retired from Credit Lyonnais after a 41-year
career at the French bank, is joining the board of Kingfisher as its seventh
non-executive director on the eleven man board.
Kingfisher's corporate affairs director Nigel Whittaker says that as well as
his familiarity with the French corporate scene, Thiolon understands British
business culture too, 'which is important and none too common.'
Earlier this year, Kingfisher merged with Darty, France's largest electrical
retailer. Top Darty executives are represented within the executive
management groups, but it is not the company's policy to put the bosses of
its operating companies on the plc board. Thiolon is a director of Darty.
Group general manager of Credit Lyonnais until his retirement at the end of
last year, 64-year-old Thiolon has also been on the board of Eurotunnel for
the last ten years.
'He speaks perfect English and he has convinced me he understands everything
about British culture - except cricket, which he thinks goes on too long'
Whittaker reckons.

ACER MUHENDISLIK MUSAVIRLIK LTD (AMM), the wholly owned Turkish subsidiary
of the Acer Group, has been awarded a contract by the municipality of
Istanbul to prepare electrical and mechanical systems, tracklaying and
finishing works tender documents for the Istanbul Metro system (pictured
above).
AMM will also review the contractor's designs and supervise construction.
A turnkey systems engineering and finishes contract worth Dollars 350m
(Pounds 233m) is expected to be tendered in late 1993 and the first phase of
the metro is planned to be operational by 1996. AMM is also advising about
integration of the metro, light rail, tramway and suburban rail forms of
transport within the city, including options for a railway crossing of the
Bosphorus from the European to the Asian side of Istanbul.
The Istanbul Metro is planned as a heavy metro system capable of carrying up
to 70,000 passengers per hour in each direction.
The system is mainly underground, with nine underground stations and one
elevated station.
Civil construction contracts have been awarded to local contractors for the
section of line from 4th Levent to Taksim. Phase two of Istanbul Light Rail
began in May 1992, with AMM supervising.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Management: Clipped wings for high flyers - Daniel Green on
the new austerity in spending on business air fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Christmas, the managing director of a City securities house lectured
his staff on business travel costs. Some Pounds 1m needed to be cut off the
Pounds 6m annual spend, he said.
First- and business-class seats should be bought only if absolutely
necessary. A consultant was brought in who found that the MD had been buying
most of the first-class tickets
himself.
The City may be one of the last places in Britain where company directors
are happy for shareholders to pay for their caviar and vintage champagne.
For most of the rest of the country, the rules and budgets are getting
tighter as travel managers are drawn into cost-cutting exercises.
'I can't think of a time in the last two years when the chairman bought a
first-class ticket,' says Barry Burnley, deputy group purchasing agent at
GKN, the engineering group.
'We encourage everyone to travel economy, but senior managers and above
travel business class. Budget-holders are expected to make sensible
decisions.'
ICI is even stricter. 'The budget is more important than the trip,' says
Roger Glenwright, business services manager. 'The class of travel should
never be more expensive than the minimum that will do the job. By and large
that means travelling economy.'
For short journeys, ICI is moving towards a policy of buying a discounted
economy ticket for the outward leg of the journey and a flexible fare -
full-price economy or business class - on the way back. 'Our studies show
that 80 per cent of flight changes, if a trip has to be cut short or
extended, happen on the return leg,' says Glenwright.
ICI's top executives still go business class for long-haul flights. But for
everyone else 'it's cheaper to send them a day early and give them a day to
recover than to send them business class,' he says.
Such arguments cut little ice with many Continental-owned companies, for
which business travel means just that. 'The policy is that everyone travels
club class,' says Barbara Kelly, administration manager at Roche Products,
part of the Swiss drug company.
'But we are rigid about the justification to go. The biggest savings come
from not going if the trip does not justify it; authorisation must be signed
by a director,' she adds.
US-owned companies also like to send everyone in the same class. IBM (UK)
has an economy-only ruling for all short-haul and flights to the east coast
of the US, even for the chief executive. Only the west coast and far east
justify business class.
Norman Ryan, corporate service manager at US-owned oil services company
Halliburton Holdings, says US companies are especially tough on air travel
costs. All but the top few per cent in his company travel economy, 'and at
the cheapest fare available', he says. Top executives travel business class
only if the flight is longer than six hours. Length of journey rules also
apply at EDS-Scicon, the Heathrow-based US-owned computer services company.
'Everybody except directors travels economy unless the journey including
connections is over 12 hours,' says Catherine Ketley, manager of
international travel. 'Directors go business class.'
There may be a danger in allowing the principle of upgrades for long
journeys. More old-fashioned luxuries can begin to work their way back into
the system. At Guinness, the multinational drinks group, there is a complex
formula in which some staff travelling eastbound overnight can go first
class. Its main board and top six executives always travel first class, the
next 450 in seniority normally go business class. The remaining 23,500
employees are eligible only for economy, if they travel at all.
Even this policy represents something of a downgrading from the good old
days for the company: until 1987, the directors had the use of a corporate
jet.
But Guinness is unusual in other ways, too. It is one of the few companies
not to have reviewed its corporate travel policy as economic conditions got
tougher.
GKN all but eliminated first class and Concorde two years ago when 'there
was a realisation that travel was both important and expensive. It was
substantially more free and easy before that,' says Burnley.
British Aerospace has also changed its rules. 'We used to have a
seniority-based system. That's been replaced with a business needs system
which focuses on the need to travel,' says Andrew Fletcher, BAe's company
secretary. 'The recession has caused the company to re-address a whole
series of costs including travel and expenses.'
Fletcher has a broader view than most of business travel trends. He is
chairman of the Business Travel Liaison Group, a body of 20 large
organisations including BP, IBM (UK), Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, and
the British Council, that lobbies airlines.
For him, a cost-conscious approach is more than just a consequence of the
recession; it reflects a change in management practice. 'It used to be the
case that the managing director went first class, the sales director went
business class and everyone else went economy. Now it is more egalitarian.'
Business class may still be the norm for senior executives, but travel
managers are more likely to be trying to secure bargain prices for good
seats for everyone than exhorting juniors to travel economy.
The egalitarian message may nevertheless take some time to get through to
the City. The MD of the securities house still travels first class. No one
has dared tell him he is the man he warned his staff about.

N&amp;P's unconventional approach to re-engineering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANYONE steeped in the conventional approach to re-engineering will be
surprised by National &amp; Provincial Building Society's method of
reorganisation. Most companies go for striking results in the first year of
a re-engineering programme, concentrating on one key process, such as
order-taking to delivery. The aim is almost always to slash cycle times, and
sometimes also costs and staff.
By contrast, N&amp;P, Britain's eighth-largest building society, has started at
the top, putting the emphasis on a change in culture and organisational
structure. In what amounts to a radical and risky experiment, it has so far
focused mainly on 'process leadership' - getting its top managers committed
and changing the way they operate - and has not yet made any change in its
front line processes. The society does not even expect to finish its
redesign for at least 18 months, and is cagey about the savings it will
deliver.
The 're-design programme' was initiated by a new management in 1990. It
followed the earlier division of N&amp;P's operations into separate businesses -
mortgages, life policies, and Visa cards, for example - and the
establishment of a 'mission' to be in the top 15 UK personal financial
service providers by 1993.
David O'Brien, chief executive since August 1990, says the product focus
'left the customer in the background'. He also believes too much attention
was given to acquisitions - and not enough to organic expansion through
better service - and says outside consultants hired by the individual
businesses pulled the organisation in different directions. The product
focus also led to 'hierarchical warfare'.
One of O'Brien's first appointments was Paul Chapman, as director of
business and organisation development. Both had worked on re-engineering at
Rank Xerox, where entrenched structures and attitudes frustrated the
beginnings of a similar change.
One of their first steps was a week of meetings with the heads of N&amp;P's
businesses and senior corporate personnel - in all about 10 people. A new
mission statement, based on meeting customer requirements while contributing
to N&amp;P's prosperity, was forged and a strategy for achieving it worked out.
The board was renamed the 'direction management team', and its operations
reorganised into a 'direction management process'. Instead of functional and
business directors, this now comprises process leaders such as directors of
'customer engagement' and 'customer requirements'. They are deeply engaged
in the planning of the new business processes.
Why then, more than two years later, is the vast majority of the society's
4,000 staff still working in much the same way?
The reason, says Chapman, is that when the change programme is complete,
eight levels of management and more than 20 grades will have become three
levels and four grades, so endangering middle managers. If those managers
are not convinced that robbing them of their traditional functional power -
though not necessarily their jobs - is good for the future, the whole
programme is jeopardised.
In order to gain the support of the middle echelons, the drive for culture
change began by concentrating on management seminars designed to communicate
N&amp;P's thinking.
Of course, this alone does not ensure that N&amp;P staff will be able to take
the society where it wants to go. So the 'direction management team' has
instigated a dual system of competency assessment and performance-related
pay.
The former is a thorough analysis of job or 'role' skills aimed at putting
the right people in each process. It relies heavily on self-assessment and
discussion at branch level. The point is that knowledge of colleagues'
strengths enables better organisation and encourages greater productivity at
all levels.
Another tangible example of the culture changes is the introduction of
fortnightly meetings - 'team events' - of all area staff at which updates
from the top echelon are communicated. One important benefit of the
meetings, according to Ann Britton, manager of the Bradford head office
branch, is that the emphasis on discussion gives everyone a stake in the
change process. 'There is a requirement to take part and I think the ability
to keep on changing is in place.'
The message that still wider change is coming seems to have hit home.
Lorraine Curtin, the 23-year-old manager of the Holborn branch in London,
says: 'Everyone used to be trying to get brownie points for themselves. Now
it's very much teamwork. You feel part of something that's going somewhere.'
Chapman says not everyone has gone along with the changes. Most of 1991 was
used to call in the 150 senior managers of the society in groups of 10 to
tell them about change. About 25 then left.
Britton admits that the changes have been 'very, very gradual' and that life
is hardly simpler. 'If I'm honest, it is that much harder.'
Concrete demonstration of improved performance, though, is still
frustratingly hard to come by. The society says that in the two years since
1990 its operating profit per employee increased by 60 per cent and its cost
to income ratio fell from 55 per cent in 1990 to 40 per cent. But part of
this cost containment might be due to the programme's main information
technology expenditure not having started. When the coal-face processes are
implemented, N&amp;P plans to map process systems on to computer and estimates
that technology expenses will run to at least Pounds 20m.
Chapman stresses that because the organisation is concentrating on the
culture change, it is too early to predict eventual improvements in cycle
times. But he does give an idea of the type of savings that could be made:
'The average time it takes to process a mortgage is 27 days. When
underwriting decisions take place at the coal-face and the full process is
put in place, the time could theoretically be 24 hours. In practice, even if
this was 13 days, that would be a huge saving and a dramatic difference.'

FT  05 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: Profit fall likely at Scottish &amp; Newcastle -
Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish &amp; Newcastle is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits today
of about Pounds 202m compared with Pounds 221m for the previous 53 weeks.
The results will reflect lower property profits and exceptional costs of
cutting staff. Growth at Center Parcs is unlikely to make up for tough
trading in the brewing and retailing sectors.
Dixons, the electrical goods retailer, is expected on Wednesday to report
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 80m for the year to April, up from Pounds
70.8m a year earlier. Some increase in UK profits will be offset by
continuing US losses. Investors hope to hear further plans for turning round
the Silo chain in the US. At best a minimal dividend increase is likely
given the low cover.
Taunton Cider should brighten the market on Tuesday with forecast profits of
Pounds 17.5m for its first full year after flotation. The cider market grew
during the past year at close to 8 per cent against a 3 per cent decline in
beer, and Taunton's brands were well placed at the premium end of the
market.
Greene King, the East-Anglian based brewer, is expected to report full-year
profits little changed at Pounds 20.3m on Thursday. Growth in the free trade
is believed to have slowed, and though the company's managed pubs have
performed well, beer sales are down in the tenanted houses.
Howden Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, is expected on
Wednesday to report flat annual profits of about Pounds 18m, after being
adversely affected by exchange rate movements.
Wednesday brings annual results from Budgens, the small UK food retailing
chain in which Rewe, one of Germany's largest food retailers, bought a 26
per cent stake in April. Budgens is expected to have increased pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.5m to between Pounds 6.5m and Pounds 7m and to resume
paying a dividend. Interest will focus on the Germans' intentions towards
the group, which management is trying to reshape.

FT  05 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: Data may back German rate cut - Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A string of important economic figures in Germany will coincide with this
week's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. The statistics, expected to highlight
considerable domestic weakness in Germany, will back up the Bundesbank's
decision to shave interest rates last week.
In spite of the latest move by the German authorities, high European
interest rates will be one of the issues preoccupying the prime ministers
and finance ministers meeting in Tokyo. Even after the German cut, rates in
continental Europe are perceived as being too high for this point in the
business cycle and the US in particular has been urging Germany to ease
monetary conditions.
West German manufacturing orders for May are forecast to be roughly
unchanged on the previous month, while jobs data will probably show another
big jump in unemployment. Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank in
London, believes there is a good chance that this week's data will indicate
that the worst of Germany's recession is over.
'A fairly convincing case can now be made for suggesting that the rate of
decline of west Germany's industrial production is slowing significantly.
But I believe it is too early to suggest that industrial production may be
rising on a trend basis,' she said.
There are few figures in the UK this week, but the Treasury's panel of wise
men issues its second report on the progress of the economy today. Consumer
credit figures, also out today, will give some indication of consumers'
willingness to borrow now that interest rates have come down.
It is a relatively busy week for figures in the US. Car and truck sales in
June are expected to have risen at roughly the same pace as in May. Consumer
credit figures are forecast to confirm that consumer indebtedness as a
proportion of income remains close to an all-time high.
The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of economists' forecasts, from MMS International, a
financial information company.
Today: UK, Treasury's seven 'wise men' release second report on state of UK
economy; May consumer credit (up Pounds 150m); June M0 (up 0.4 per cent on

cent); May motor vehicle sales; June housing starts (up 155,000 units).

FT  05 JUL 93 / Bank code faces big shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE committee reviewing the code of practice for banks and building
societies is to consider changing it. The aim would be to ensure that
societies inform investors more clearly of alterations in the level of
interest paid on different accounts.
The lack of clear notification to investors that their accounts offer lower
returns than newer products from the same society has become one of the main
sources of complaint by customers.
The review committee, set up by clearing banks to discuss changes to the
code from next March, is also likely to consider stronger requirements for
banks to obtain the free consent of customers before disclosing account data
internally.
Some banks including Barclays have been criticised for requiring customers
to sign clauses consenting to their account details being given to the
bank's sales subsidiaries.
Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England who is
heading the review committee, said that he could not prejudge the outcome of
discussions, but it was already clear that several aspects of the code would
have to be examined over the next few months.
Sir George said that initial submissions from interested parties, including
consumer groups, had raised a number of concerns. The National Association
of Citizens Advice Bureaux last week said that the voluntary code was being
ignored by many banks.
The committee is reviewing how the voluntary code, signed by the British
Bankers Association and the Building Societies Association, has worked since
its introduction in March 1992. It was intended as an alternative to legal
regulation.
The committee's work is backed by banks and societies but some officials
believe there could be conflict between the committee and financial services
companies if its recommendations proved onerous.
Other revisions to the code which the committee is likely to consider
include:
Banks having to give stronger warnings to business partners - particularly
the spouses of small business owners - of the unlimited liability they could
incur by giving personal guarantees to underwrite business loans.
Banks being required to 'pre-notify' charges to be deducted from customers'
current accounts, rather than simply publishing account tariffs. National
Westminster introduced such a policy this year.
Banks and societies being barred from imposing 'interest on charges' in
cases where charges on accounts put customers into overdraft and so attract
interest payments. Banks are already barred from making account charges in
such cases.
Although banks and societies might resist changes which will cost them large
sums to implement or disrupt attempts to sell more products to their
customers, the committee will be under some pressure to respond to public
opinion.
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux last week published its
submission to the review committee, which called for banks to observe a
statutory code of practice. It said they were ignoring the spirit of the
voluntary one.

AS MANY as six of the 12 pits reprieved by the government are soon to close,
Mr Norman Willis, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said
yesterday.
On the eve of today's Commons debate on coal Mr Willis used a letter to Mr

The letter came as National Power, the largest electricity generator,
confirmed it would not consider additional coal purchases until the autumn.

FT  05 JUL 93 / 'Further 100,000' building jobs to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 100,000 con-struction jobs are expected to be lost this year and
next, taking the total number of jobs shed since 1989 to almost 500,000,
says a forecast published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, Andrew Taylor writes.
Over-capacity in the industry means jobs are likely to continue to be lost
even though construction output is predicted to recover by 3.6 per cent next
year.
The forecast used a computer-based model for the construction industry
developed by Reading University, Cambridge Econometrics and quantity
surveyors Gardiner &amp; Theobald.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Major to be pressed for July by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will this week come under strong pressure to set July 29 as
the date for the Christchurch by-election.
The Liberal Democrats have indicated that they are ready to break with
tradition and seek to move the by-election writ in the Commons themselves if
Mr John Major seeks to delay the poll until September.
Mr Major has delayed the by-election because of the potentially devastating
impact on party morale if the Conservatives' 23,000 majority is overturned.
But the government may well pre-empt the Liberal Democrats because MPs are
expected to break for their long summer recess before July 29.
The prime minister is also being advised by colleagues that a defeat in
September would further sour the mood at the Conservatives' autumn
conference in Blackpool, increasing the pressure on his own position.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Warning not to cut housing cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-PARTY group of MPs is expected to warn the government tomorrow
against reducing the proportion of public money used to fund housing
association projects.
Associations have been expected to raise an increasing proportion of private
finance to construct or acquire homes for social housing.
A report from the environment committee, however, will urge ministers that
the rate of government grants to housing associations should not fall
further unless procurement costs fall or the government as a whole takes a
view about the impact of a lower rate both on rent affordability and on
benefit dependency.
Average grant rates have fallen from 75 per cent in 1991-92 to 67 per cent
in 1993-94, as the crackdown on public spending has increased pressure on
the housing budget.
The Treasury has already identified the housing budget as an area for
possible savings.
The committee emphasises that if the rate falls further it will increase the
need for housing associations to raise more money privately as well as
through forcing up rents.
But, it argues, raising rents may discourage potential private investors,
reluctant to commit themselves to the increased risk that tenants will not
be able to keep up their payments.
It expresses particular concern about the position of specialist and smaller
housing associations, which already have the most difficulty in attracting
private finance.
Officials at the Department of the Environment expect the committee to be
relatively neutral on the question of allowing private developers to compete
for government housing grant.
Some Tories have enthusiastically put forward the idea as a way of getting
better value for money and of challenging the dominant position of the
housing associations. In what looks like a compromise, however, the report
is said merely to recommend a study into the feasibility of such a move.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Row blows up over holiday failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW over who should bear the cost of compensating the customers of failed
holiday companies has broken out between the Civil Aviation Authority,
credit card companies and the travel industry.
Travel agents have complained that the authority and Barclaycard have forced
them to bear the cost of tour operator collapses.
All the holidaymakers involved have received full compensation because the
failed tour operators had Air Travel Organisers' Licences issued by the
authority. Where travellers had paid for their holidays by Barclaycard, the
authority insisted that Barclaycard bear the cost.
The Association of British Travel Agents says that 10 of its members
complained that Barclaycard had, in turn, debited their bank accounts for
the cost of the holidays.
The travel agents say they should not be held responsible for the collapse
of tour operators. They say the debiting of their accounts has left them out
of pocket.
Although they have had to pay the full cost of the holidays, they only
received commissions of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent at the time of
sale. This was further reduced by having to pay credit card commissions.
The authority says its policy is to look for other means of compensating
customers before drawing on the failed company's bonds or its own reserve
fund.
Barclaycard says it has not debited travel agents' accounts itself. In some
cases, it passed on the cost of compensation to the bank responsible for the
agents' card transactions.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Thousands more electricity jobs to go over next 3 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 10,000 jobs were lost in the privatised electricity industry in
England and Wales last year, and several thousand more are likely to go in
the next two or three years.
This emerged from the financial results of the regional electricity
companies and the two power generators which have been announced over the
past six weeks. All the companies have given cost-cutting top priority.
The biggest job losses occurred at the two large power generating companies,
National Power and PowerGen, which are rationalising their power station
networks to cut out excess capacity, and shifting to more efficient forms of
power generation such as gas.
National Power shed 4,000 workers, bringing its workforce down to 7,400
compared with about 16,000 at privatisation just over two years ago. The
company warned that more than 1,000 jobs will have to go over the next two
or three years.
PowerGen cut 1,100 jobs last year, reducing its workforce to 4,900, barely
half its size at privatisation.
Among the 12 regional distribution companies some of the most severe cuts
came at Southern Electric, based outside Maidenhead, Berkshire. It cut 600
from its 7,800 workforce last year, and said 1,000 more employees would have
to go over the next three years.
The cuts were part of a six-month-old deal agreed with staff and unions to
introduce more flexible staffing. As with most electricity companies, the
job cuts enabled Southern to report a strong gain in profits and recommend a
double-digit rise in the dividend.
Big job losses also came at Seeboard, serving south-east England. Nearly 400
jobs went last year from a workforce of 6,000, and 500 to 600 will go this
year, mainly through an exercise to reduce headquarters staff.
As well as job cuts, staff at some regional companies faced reductions in
wages, particularly those engaged in contracting work where wages had
outstripped private-sector levels under the Central Electricity Generating
Board's management.
Although the regional companies are all striving to achieve efficiency
gains, their cost-cutting comes ahead of a possible tightening of price
controls by the electricity regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild. He is
engaged in a two-part review of prices and is due to announce the results of
the first part in within a week.
These could include a decision to oblige electricity companies to absorb
more costs rather than passing them straight on to customers.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Willis questions pit reprieves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MANY as six of the 12 pits reprieved by the government's coal white paper
are soon to close, Mr Norman Willis, general-secretary of the Trades Union
Congress, said yesterday.
On the eve of today's Commons debate on coal Mr Willis used a letter to Mr
John Major to accuse the government of failing to address 'the fundamental
issues of the market' and to predict that over the next 18 months 38 pits
would close.
The letter came as National Power, the largest electricity generator,
confirmed that it would not consider additional coal purchases until the
autumn.
British Coal has already negotiated to sell 40m tonnes of coal to the main
electricity generators this year but needs to increase sales by a further
15m tonnes a year if the future of the 12 pits is to be secured.
In today's debate on a Labour motion urging the government to adopt
recommendations put forward by a cross-party committee of MPs in January, Mr
Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, is expected to renew his
recent attack on the coal white paper as a 'fraud'.
At least one Conservative MP has served notice of an intention to vote
against the government or to abstain.
Labour's motion criticises the government for encouraging the belief that
its white paper would reprieve 12 pits and widen the market for their coal
by providing a subsidy for their output. It notes that 'within three months
of its publication two of those pits have already closed'.
The confirmation of National Power's position on additional coal purchases
came in a memorandum sent last week to Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, the
Conservative MP for Batley &amp; Spen, a prominent coal rebel.
The company said it had 'no commercial need' for further coal at present and
would in any case have nowhere to put the additional supplies.
It said it had nearly 20m tonnes of coal at power station sites and
additional supplies would not be burnt for 'some considerable time'.
It said it would 'reconsider the question of possible additional purchases
in the autumn'.

FT  05 JUL 93 / German chambers have more resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMBERS OF commerce in Britain have only a fraction of the resources
available to their German counterparts, a study published today shows.
British chambers have only one fifteenth of the resources of German chambers
on average, while staff numbers are just one sixth of German levels. This
means UK chambers often offer a far narrower range of services.
In spite of their limited resources the British chambers are active in
helping their members develop business in continental Europe, their unit
costs are lower and they are more commercial in their approach to the needs
of business, the study says.
Official backing for the German chambers and the requirement for businesses
to register with their local chamber make for a much larger organisation.
The German chambers have 3.2m members employing 25m people.
The UK chambers of commerce and chambers of trade, with voluntary
membership, have just 210,000 members with 4m employees.
The report says: 'The British chambers suffer the disadvantages of
smallness, unevenness and competition with other organisations but have
potential advantages deriving from having to be close to the market needs of
their members. German chambers, by their public law status, are assured of
critical mass.'

FT  05 JUL 93 / Companies braced for missile cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH DEFENCE companies are awaiting announcements on a series of cuts in
equipment plans when the government's annual defence white paper is
published today.
Mr Brian Lowe, director-general of the Defence Manufacturers'Association,
said: 'I don't think industry is expecting any good news. It's a question of
how bad the bad news is.'
The government is widely expected to abandon the idea of a new air-launched
nuclear missile, which would have relied on either French or US technology.
Also precarious are plans for air defence missiles, which are the subject of
an international contest, and UK participation in a cluster weapon for
multiple rocket launchers.
The ministry has also been reviewing plans for upgrading the RAF's Tornado
bombers and for either modernising or replacing current-generation tanks. A
decision on the tanks may not emerge until later, however.
In exchange for being allowed to go ahead with a helicopter carrier, ordered
in May, the Navy is expected to have to dispose of its four brand-new
Upholder class diesel-electric submarines.
In a departure from the normal practice for the annual white paper, Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is due to make a statement to the
Commons this afternoon.
The Ministry of Defence has to find more than Pounds 1bn of savings in this
financial year and the next to match budget cuts imposed in last November's
public expenditure round.
The impatience of military contractors has been growing as the ministry has
held back announcements on new guided weapons projects and other large
programmes.
Mr Lowe said: 'Any definitive plan would be helpful. What we want are
decisions, whether they are good or bad.'
The white paper will mark a significant further step in defence changes
following the government's Options for Change exercise, which was outlined
in 1990 and fleshed out the following year.
Ministers have promised that the document will be 'an eye-opener', breaking
new ground in releasing detailed information about the UK's military
commitments and what they cost. Mr Archie Hamilton, the former armed forces
minister, yesterday called for military cuts in Northern Ireland to help
reduce the defence budget.
Mr Hamilton, who left the government in the last reshuffle, said more troops
did not necessarily mean less terrorism.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Take a train or walk, City motorists told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY OF London workers were urged by the police and motoring organisations
to leave their cars at home or face heavy delays as the experimental scheme
of traffic regulation in the heart of the capital faces its first weekday
morning.
'Potentially it could be a nightmare,' the RAC said. 'The cost and
disruption to everyone could be enormous.'
The RAC, along with several other bodies including the City of London
police, yesterday issued advice to the travelling public:
Leave your car at home if possible.
Use trains. Rail and Underground travel is unaffected. Walk. All pedestrian
routes are unaffected. Motorists crossing the Thames should avoid the City.
Do not expect any extra parking spaces in the boroughs on the fringes of the
City.
Allow an extra 30 minutes if travelling through the City in a car or bus.
Forget your old routes and follow the diversion signs.
Do not attempt to drive around or through the temporary barriers - driving
irregularly could set off a security alert.
Tune into your local radio station to find routes to avoid. LBC, on 97.3 FM
and 1152 kHz, has travel news from 6am and bulletins every 10 minutes until
9am. Capital Radio has regular traffic reports from 6am on 95.8 FM.
Use the traffic hotline. The Corporation of London, the local authority for
the City, is providing a hotline in conjunction with the City Police for
traffic information only on 071 332-3555, from 6am to 5pm today and from 9am
to 5pm tomorrow.
Check that your usual bus has not been re-routed. A bus information hotline
is on 071 222-1234.
Buses affected include 8, 15, 15B, 15X, 17, 22A, 22B, 25, 26, 35, 42, 47,
48, 78, 141, 149, 172, 214, 271, 344, 505, D1, D9, D11 and night buses N8,
N26 and N83.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Analysts disagree over wage trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF Britain's biggest pay analysis organisations have taken sharply
differing views on whether the downward trend in pay settlements is
continuing.
Industrial Relations Services today publishes its latest report, which says
that in the three months to the end of May the average settlement across the
economy was 2.3 per cent.
'A number of indicators suggest that pay award levels remain under strong
downward pressure, and there seems little immediate prospect of basic pay
rises increasing,' IRS report says.
Incomes Data Services, a rival organisation, has however, seen signs that
the level of pay increases 'may now have stabilised'.
IDS, which reports that two thirds of recently monitored settlements gave
rises between 2 per cent and 3.9 per cent, says: 'Assuming that economic
recovery is under way, there is likely to be some rebound from the
belt-tightening of prolonged recession.'
IDS says that one in seven of recent rises are above 4 per cent.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Bank of England governor says interest rates at 'right
level'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK INTEREST rates were at the right level, Mr Eddie George, the new governor
of the Bank of England, said yesterday. They were not particularly high when
measured against the underlying rate of inflation, and the long-term aim
should be to reduce the underlying rate of price increases to a range of
zero to 2 per cent, he said.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Japanese to open Midlands textiles factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORAY, Japan's biggest textiles company, will on Wednesday open the east
Midlands' second-biggest inward investment project after Toyota's car plant
at Derby.
A Pounds 50m weaving mill at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, will employ 200
people in its early stages, rising to as many as 400 in two years. The new
jobs will make little impact on Mansfield's unemployment, swollen to more
than 6,000 by mine closures.
The highly automated plant's output will help reduce the Pounds 42m
polyester fabric import bill that Britain paid Japan last year. Toray also
plans to export the UK-made fabrics to the rest of Europe.
The factory will take polyester filament and twist it in a variety of ways
before weaving it. Mr Colin Purvis, secretary-general of the British Apparel
and Textile Confederation, said this would create the most sophisticated
textures in polyester fabrics available in the UK. Most of the buyers of the
cloth will be clothing suppliers to Marks and Spencer, the UK's biggest
garment retailer.
Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, Europe's biggest textiles
company and a clothing supplier to M and S, said: 'This is good for the
British textiles industry. You've got much quicker response and a much
shorter supply line for these fabrics.'
The Mansfield plant will eventually double Toray's fabric output in the UK
to 39m metres a year. The company's UK turnover should rise to Pounds 80m a
year as the new plant joins others at Hyde, Cheshire, and Bulwell,
Nottinghamshire.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Fears over redundancy continue to increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERCENTAGE of workers who fear that they may lose their jobs in the next
12 months continues to rise in spite of a further fall in official
unemployment figures, a MORI survey published exclusively in the Financial
Times shows today.
The increasing fear of redundancy is particularly pronounced among women,
people aged 18 to 34 and those living in the Midlands.
A quarter of those in work say they are 'very con-cerned' about being made
redundant, rising to 36 per cent among the youngest cat-egory, those aged 18
to 24.
The survey appears to indicate that some confidence has returned to
professional and managerial employees during the past month.
But overall, 44 per cent of workers are now 'very' or 'fairly' worried they
could be made redundant in the coming year - up from 41 per cent in April,
the first month of the research series commissioned from MORI by Industrial
Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions research group.
Official seasonally-adjusted unemployment figures fell between April and May
by 26,100 to 2.914m. This fourth consecutive monthly fall cut the
seasonally-adjusted jobless rate to 10.4 per cent from 10.5 per cent in
April and a winter peak of 10.6 per cent.
Anxiety among women has risen 5 percentage points since April to 40 per
cent, but is still lower than that shown by men.
Concern among all groups of employees in the Midlands has risen from 40 per
cent to 49 per cent.
MORI interviewed 978 adults aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work,
face-to-face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points
throughout Britain from June 24 to 28. Data were weighted to match the
profile of the population.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Executive pay rises slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK EXECUTIVES' pay rises have slowed to less than half the annual rate that
prevailed at the start of the recession, the latest index produced for the
Financial Times by the Noble Lowndes group of management consultancies
shows.
The index, which includes benefits such as cars and pensions as well as
salaries and bonuses, shows an average increase for all ranks of executives
of 5.3 per cent over the past 12 months. The figure for just the first six
months of 1990 was 6.5 per cent.
As companies have put a tight grip on pay expenditure, the average annual
rate of increase even for chief executives has fallen below 6 per cent. Yet
there are signs that, after applying the brake increasingly hard to last
December, companies are starting to relax it again.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Business leaders 'less confident'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE IN Britain's economic prospects among business leaders has
weakened over the past two months, says the Institute of Directors' business
opinion survey today.
The sharpest fall comes from medium-sized companies and manufacturers.
The proportion of directors expressing optimism about the economy fell from
65 per cent in April to 55 per cent in June, indicating uncertainty about
the steadiness of the UK's economic recovery. It nevertheless remains at the
second highest level for almost five years.
Directors are happier about the prospects for their own businesses, with 66
per cent more confident than six months ago compared with 64 per cent in
April.
The survey, which is produced every two months, reports that more than two
thirds of directors say their company is doing well - slightly less than in
April.
Profitability continues to rise while order books remain unchanged. Profits
for the last six months were higher than for same period in the previous
year for 45 per cent of directors - up from 39 per cent in April. Twenty-one
per cent say that profits have fallen - down from April's 34 per cent.
These figures disguise sharp variations by industry. Mining and construction
companies show the biggest jump, with 49 per cent of directors saying
profits had risen, compared with 33 per cent in April.
By contrast, companies in personal and business services show falls in
profits.
The fall in confidence in the economy is most evident in the manufacturing
sector, where 49 per cent of respondents are more confident than six months
ago compared with 65 per cent in April.
Directors from companies employing 101 to 200 people show a sharp fall in
optimism from 81 per cent to 52 per cent.
South-east England will lag behind the rest of the country in any economic
recovery this year and next, says a review of regional economic prospects by
Cambridge Econometrics, the research group.
Continued job losses in manufacturing and services in London and the rest of
the region are to blame, says the report published today.
The West Midlands will also have a bad year, but is expected to join other
manufacturing regions in stronger export-led growth.
In the longer term employment will grow faster in the south of England, the
Midlands and Wales than in the northern half of the country but it will take
several years before jobs lost in the south during the recession are
regained.
The survey says East Anglia has the best prospects. The gross domestic
product of the region will rise faster than anywhere else in the country,
gaining 4.3 per cent next year, compared with 2.8 per cent for the UK as a
whole and 1.8 per cent for Greater London.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Phone service aims to follow the customer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS CARDS listing what sometimes looks like a whole directory of
telephone and fax numbers could soon be a thing of the past.
A new telecommunications company plans a nationwide launch next year of a
'personal numbering' service.
Subscribers will be given a single number. A special exchange programmed
with their daily movements, alterable by a single phone call, will then
automatically route their calls as directed - whether to their office, home,
or to a secretary.
Numbering Viewed Worldwide, the private company intending to market the
service, gained a telecommunications licence last year and says it plans to
invest about Pounds 30m in the operation over the next five years, including
at least Pounds 4m before next summer's launch.
The technology required for personal numbering is not new. In the US
American Telephone and Telegraph, the largest operator, already operates an
'easy reach' scheme.
The cost of upgrading Britain's 7,500 exchanges had been thought to make a
UK personal numbering service unlikely for some time. But Numbering Viewed
Worldwide believes it can make personal numbering viable by routing calls
through a small number of 'intelligent island sites' fitted with the
necessary equipment, rather than by upgrading existing exchanges. It plans
to have one open by the launch, with up to eight built over five years.
Subscribers will be charged about Pounds 10 to join, and about Pounds 5 a
month thereafter. Calls to personal numbers will be charged at premium rates
 -higher than standard tariffs but 'well below' those of cellular operators.
The company said: 'We anticipate a potential subscriber market for personal
numbering and related 'intelligent network' services of more than 2m by year
five.'
Personal numbering has strong support from Oftel, the industry regulator. Mr
Don Cruickshank, Oftel's director, said it was 'an important new development
in the telephone market'.
In its proposals for allocating the 9bn new numbers set to become available
with the national code change in April 1995, Oftel plans to dedicate a block
for personal numbering operators. BT said it had 'no plans' to launch a
personal numbering service of its own.

FT  05 JUL 93 / German chambers 'have more staff'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMBERS of commerce in Britain have only a fraction of the resources
available to their German counterparts, a study published today shows.
British chambers have only one fifteenth of the resources of German chambers
on average, while staff numbers are just one sixth of German levels. This
means UK chambers often offer a far narrower range of services.
In spite of their limited resources the British chambers have lower unit
costs and they are more commercial in their approach to the needs of
business, the study says.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Buy-out activity increases after lull
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT buy-out activity increased in the second quarter of the year
after a lull in the preceding six months, KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy
firm, has reported.
It says even more deals would have been completed if vendors, often
companies disposing of non-essential subsidiaries, had not increased steeply
the prices they were asking.
Fourteen buy-outs of more than Pounds 10m were completed between April and
June compared with nine in the first three months, 10 in the final quarter
of 1992 and 13 in the second quarter last year.
The value of the second-quarter deals was Pounds 710m compared with Pounds
460m in the first quarter, Pounds 800m in the fourth quarter of last year
and Pounds 410m in the second quarter last year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER education lecturers yesterday decided to strike in September over
new contracts introduced by employers, John Authers writes.
The contracts sent to colleges on Thursday are initially only for new
appointments and lecturers gaining promotion. They would cut annual holiday
leave by half - from 14 weeks to seven - and add an hour to the working day.
Yesterday the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher
Education, meeting at its annual conference in Bristol, condemned the
contracts. It also refused to negotiate formally with the College Employers'
Forum, which represents most college principals, while the new contracts
remained on the agenda.
It said that it would negotiate only 'without preconditions'. Mr Roger Ward,
chief executive of the forum, has rejected this demand.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Cadbury guidelines face delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPLEMENTATION of import-ant parts of the Cadbury code on corporate
governance is to be delayed after growing pressure from business.
Final versions of guidelines for directors' commentaries in the accounts of
whether their companies remain 'going concerns' and on the quality of their
internal controls are unlikely to appear before the end of this year.
A separate statement by the accountancy profession on interim financial
reporting has also been stalled.
Details of the slowdown are due to be released this week by several
organisations including the Financial Reporting Council, the parent body for
the Accounting Standards Board, and the 100 Group of leading finance
directors.
The reporting council's announcement this week is designed to placate
companies by stressing that the Cadbury code does not require statements on
internal controls or going concerns until the guidelines have been
discussed, completed and tested.
It will also emphasise the need for greater co-ordination between
standard-setting bodies.
The delays follow growing concern by industry over the quantity and
consistency of financial reporting standards with which they are expected to
comply, and the variety of bodies producing them.
Concern has intensified recently because companies with year-ends after June
30 are expected to present a statement of compliance with the Cadbury code
in their annual reports on pain of delisting.
Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director of the Prudential and chairman of the
100 Group, warned in a speech to a Confederation of British Industry
conference last month of companies suffering 'corporate overload'.
His comments led to a crisis meeting last week co-ordinated by Sir Ron
Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council.
Delays in producing the new statements have been caused by concerns about
how practicable and acceptable they are to businesses. The statement on
internal controls is believed to have been through 17 drafts already.

FT  05 JUL 93 / 'It could be a nightmare' warns RAC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY OF London workers were urged by the police and motoring organisations
to leave their cars at home, or face major delays, as the experimental
scheme of traffic regulation in the heart of the capital faces its first
Monday morning.
The RAC, the motoring organisation, said: 'Potentially it could be a
nightmare. The cost and disruption to everyone could be enormous.'
The RAC, along with several other bodies including the City of London
police, spent a busy day yesterday issuing a list of 'do's and don'ts' to
the travelling public. They included:
Leave your car at home if possible.
Motorists crossing the River Thames should avoid the City.
Do not expect any extra parking spaces in the boroughs on the fringes of the
City.
Allow an extra 30 minutes if travelling through the City in a car or bus.
Forget your old routes and follow the diversion signs. The City of London
Police said: 'You cannot drive in or out of the City except at the
designated spots. All other routes will be barricaded.'
Do not attempt to drive around or through the temporary barriers - driving
irregularly could set off a security alert.
Tune into your local radio station to find routes to avoid. LBC, on 97.3 FM
and 1152 kHz, has travel news from 6am and bulletins every 10 minutes until
9am. Capital Radio has regular traffic reports from 6am on 95.8 FM.
Use the traffic hotline. The Corporation of London is providing a hotline in
conjunction with the City of London Police for traffic information only on
071 332-3555. from 6am to 5pm today and from 9am to 5pm tomorrow.
Check that your usual bus has not been re-routed. A bus information hotline
is on 071 222-1234.
Buses affected include 8, 15, 15B, 15X, 17, 22A, 22B, 25, 26, 35, 42, 47,
48, 78, 141, 149, 172, 214, 271, 344, 505, D1, D9, D11 and night buses N8,
N26 and N83.
Do use the train. Rail and underground travel is unaffected and should
operate as normal.
Walk. All pedestrian routes are unaffected.
Stay alert to the threat of bombs - both in the City and elsewhere in the
capital. Report all suspicious packages.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Weekend violence erupts in Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE and fire crews came under attack yesterday as the weekend of violence
in Belfast continued. The civil unrest, which flared after the funeral on
Friday of Ulster Volunteer Force terrorist Brian McCallum - who accidentally
killed himself with his own grenade - was Ulster's worst for years, police
said.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, interrupted his weekend to
fly back to the city, where he condemned the 'cowardly' attacks.
An RUC spokesman said several people, including three police officers, were
injured during seven hours of 'serious public disorder' overnight.
The most serious rioting was in parts of south and north Belfast.
The overnight violence followed 15 hours of unrest during Friday and early
Saturday when RUC officers were the targets of a wave of gun and grenade
attacks, for which the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters claimed
responsibility.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Lecturers to strike over new contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER education lecturers yesterday decided to take strike action in
September over new contracts introduced by employers, John Authers writes.
The contracts, sent to colleges on Thursday, and initially only for new
appointments and lecturers gaining promotion, would cut annual holiday leave
by half - from 14 weeks to seven - and add an hour to the working day.
Yesterday the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher
Education, meeting at its annual conference in Bristol, condemned the
contracts. It also refused to negotiate formally with the College Employers'
Forum, which represents most college principals, while the new contracts
remain on the agenda.
It said that it would negotiate only 'without preconditions'. Mr Roger Ward,
chief executive of the forum, has rejected this demand.
The employers say that the new demands on further education, such as
increased part-time courses and evening classes, require more flexible
contracts.
Lecturers will work to rule by refusing to work through the summer holiday.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Law Society attacks curb on criminal justice report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARRANGEMENTS for publish-ing the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice were attacked by the Law Society yesterday.
The society, the solicitors' professional body, is angry at the commission's
refusal to give it an advance copy of the report and thereby enable it to
prepare a response.
The commission is refusing to allow anyone to see the report until tomorrow
 -the date of publication.
The society's irritation has been increased by the knowledge that several
copies of the report have been circulating among senior members of the
criminal Bar for several days.
The society said the refusal to release the report in advance under embargo
would prevent informed debate on the day and would heighten speculation.
The commission, which has conducted the widest-ranging review of the English
criminal justice system this century, is expected to recommend measures to
prevent further miscarriages of justice, speed up criminal justice and cut
waste in the system.
Among measures expected to be in the report are:
Introduction of a formal system of plea bargaining offering sentence
discounts for an early plea of guilty.
A requirement for defendants to disclose details of their case to the
prosecution before trial.
An independent tribunal to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice.
An independent forensic science service available to defence and
prosecution.
Safeguards to prevent conviction on the basis of a confession unless it is
made in the presence of a third party or supported by other evidence.
The commission may also make recommendations curbing an accused person's
right to silence. It is, however, believed to be split on whether to
recommend abolition of a defendant's right to trial by jury in a case which
can be tried by magistrates or in the Crown Court.

FT  05 JUL 93 / End in sight to dialling conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS CARDS listing what sometimes looks like whole a directory of
telephone and fax numbers could soon be a thing of the past.
A new telecommunications company is planning a nationwide launch next year
of a 'personal numbering' service.
Subscribers will be given a single number. A special exchange programmed
with their daily movements, alterable by a single phone call, will then
automatically route their calls as directed - whether to their office, home,
a secretary, a voice box or wherever.
Numbering Viewed Worldwide, the private company intending to market the
service, gained a government telecommunications licence last year and says
it plans to invest about Pounds 30m in the operation over the next five
years, at least Pounds 4m of it before next summer's launch.
Mr Stanford White, its director and a former executive in the US Bell
system, said: 'This is a serious venture. Although geared mainly at business
at the outset, we are planning a national awareness campaign right from the
start.'
The 'intelligent network' technology required for personal numbering is not
new. In the US AT&amp;T, the largest operator, already operates an 'easy reach'
scheme using 0700 numbers.
But the cost of upgrading Britain's 7,500 exchanges had previously been
thought to make a UK personal numbering service unlikely for some time.
However, Mr White believes he can make make personal numbering commercially
viable by routing calls through a small number of 'intelligent island
sites', fitted with the necessary equipment, rather than by upgrading
existing exchanges. He plans to have one open by the launch, with up to
eight built over five years.
Subscribers will be charged about Pounds 10 to join, and about Pounds 5 a
month thereafter. Calls to personal numbers will be charged at premium rates
 -higher than standard tariffs but 'well below' those of cellular operators.
'We anticipate a potential subscriber market for personal numbering and
related 'intelligent network' services of more than 2m by year five,' said
Mr White.
Personal numbering has strong support from Oftel, the industry regulator. Mr
Don Cruickshank, Oftel's director, called it 'an important new development
in the telephone market'.
In its proposals for allocating the 9bn new numbers set to become available
with the national code change in April 1995, Oftel plans to dedicate a block
for personal numbering operators.
'This will enable such numbers to be identified by callers and easily
processed by the operators,' the regulator said.
Mr White's marketing pitch is alluring. 'The plethora of numbers - office,
mobile, pager, fax, etc - printed on the back of business cards is an
invitation to an expensive and time-consuming gamble. One number to ring -
or to leave a message if the person is really unavailable - is a huge
advantage.'
BT says it has 'no plans' to launch a personal numbering service of its own.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Fears over redundancy still rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERCENTAGE of workers who fear they could lose their jobs within the
next 12 months continues to rise, in spite of the fourth consecutive drop in
official unemployment figures, a MORI survey published exclusively in the
Financial Times reveals today.
The increasing fear of redundancy is particularly pronounced among women,
people aged 18 to 34 and those living in the Midlands.
A quarter of those in work say they are 'very concerned' about being made
redundant, rising to 36 per cent among the youngest category, 18- to
24-year-olds.
The survey appears to indicate that some confidence has returned during the
past month to professional and managerial employees.
But overall, 44 per cent of workers are now 'very' or 'fairly' worried they
could be made redundant over the coming year - up from 41 per cent in April,
the first month of the research series, commissioned from MORI by Industrial
Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions research group.
Official seasonally-adjusted unemployment figures fell between April and May
by 26,100 to 2.914m. This fourth consecutive monthly fall cut the
seasonally-adjusted jobless rate to 10.4 per cent from 10.5 per cent in
April and a winter peak of 10.6 per cent.
Mr Andrew Brode, IRS publisher, said the continued rise in the IRS/MORI
index 'shows that in the real world - uninhabited by politicians - all is
not well'.
Anxiety among women has risen 5 percentage points since April to 40 per
cent, but is still lower than the fear shown by men that they could lose
their jobs: 46 per cent of men were worried in April, a figure which rose
slightly to 47 per cent by June.
Concern among 18- to 34-year-olds has risen from 40 per cent to 48 per cent
since April and, among all groups of employees in the Midlands, from 40 per
cent to 49 per cent. May saw a sharp increase in fear of redundancy among
social groups A and B - 28 per cent in April to 41 per cent - but this has
now dropped back down to 32 per cent.
MORI interviewed 978 adults aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work,
face-to-face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points
throughout Britain on June 24-28. Data was weighted to match the profile of
the population.
The Finance and Leasing Association says in a report today that consumer
credit in May was 29 per cent higher than a year earlier, Daniel Green
writes. Motor finance was up 16 per cent and finance for the business
community rose a 'patchy' 15 per cent.
New car loans are leading the way in a recovery in consumer demand according
to a report today from Infolink, the credit information organisation.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Backing grows for talks with PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half the ministers in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
cabinet support the idea of direct talks between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation over the future of the occupied territories, Israel
television reported last night.
At yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting, ministers from the left-wing Meretz
party urged the immediate opening of face-to-face negotiations with the PLO
and Mr Yassir Arafat, its leader, to try to break the deadlock in the Middle
East peace process.
Mr Rabin himself remains adamantly opposed to the PLO's inclusion in the
peace process and he blocked a cabinet vote on the direct talks proposal.
However, several ministers from Mr Rabin's own Labour party echoed the call.
Mr Uzi Baram, Labour's tourism minister, said later that the 'worst error'
of successive Israeli governments since the capture of the territories in
1967 had been the boycott of talks with the PLO.
Earlier this year the Israeli parliament lifted a ban on meetings between
Israeli citizens and the PLO.
The growing support at cabinet for a direct government dialogue with the
Tunis-based PLO leadership reflects Israeli concern at the rise of the
radical Islamic movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.

   HANOI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAMESE planners have drawn up a long list of projects in great need of
capital, which may be forthcoming if, as expected, the International
Monetary Fund resumes lending to the country.
President Bill Clinton said on Friday the US was dropping its opposition to
the clearing of Vietnam's Dollars 140m (Pounds 93m) arrears to the IMF.
Under the fund's rules, no new loans can be made until this outstanding
amount is paid off.
However, France, Japan and Australia have already said they are ready to
provide a bridging loan to meet this requirement.
Once this is finalised, economists at the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank will be ready to start implementing plans they have been
drawing up to help rebuild Vietnam.
For the IMF, the priority will be to keep the economy on a steady path as
the once-communist government brings in more free market elements.
That means providing budget support for the government to continue limited
subsidies to individuals and companies until they are ready to face the
harsh world of the market.
At the World Bank, the priority will be project lending to start work on the
country's dilapidated infrastructure. Outside the main cities, roads are
narrow and potholed, bridges are falling down and ports and rivers are so
badly silted up that only boats with shallow draft can use them.
Power is another problem. Southern Vietnam, in particular, is very short of
the electricity it badly needs to fuel its economic growth.
The Asian Development Bank said on Friday it was ready to approve Dollars
250m in loans to Vietnam, as soon as the US had lifted its trade embargo.
Such a move is thought more likely following Mr Clinton's announcement.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICKEY MOUSE and Donald Duck are back in China - but their behaviour must be
politically and socially correct. Donald's exuberant nephews will not be
allowed to set a bad example for Chinese children, says Mr Zhao Wenyi, a
senior editor of China's Post and Telecommunications Press, Disney's partner
in China.
Also excluded from Chinese editions of Disney comics, for example, will be a
sequence in which a lad eating an ice cream and leading a dog pursuing a cat
becomes entangled in a tree with the ice cream smeared across his face.
'Since, in Chinese cities, it is not allowed to raise a dog, not to mention
a dog led by a small boy, we didn't want to run counter to the regulations
so we dropped the story,' said Mr Zhao.
It would have been 'perfectly all right' if the boy were running after a
bee, which would have been 'more like a Chinese situation'.
Also banished from Donald Duck's family will be his money-worshipping Uncle
Scrooge, whose habit of bathing in piles of dollar bills is not deemed
appropriate for a Chinese audience - never mind that people have been told
for the past 10 years that 'to get rich is glorious'.
In spite of the amendments, Disney executives are excited about returning to
China's market of 1.1bn people, after a first attempt to introduce a
Chinese-speaking Mickey and Donald in 1987.
Disney pulled out in 1990, in protest at counterfeiting of its comics and
products. Now, though, with the passage of China's first copyright law, the
company has decided to return, lured by the market's enormous potential.
The first new edition of Mickey Mouse comics appeared in China on June 1,
international children's day, with an initial print run of 60,000 copies.
These were snapped up almost overnight, at a price equivalent to about 30 US
cents (20p) each.
Mr Zhao has no doubt that Mickey and Donald will prove a success and, in the
process, provide a welcome change for Chinese children from their regular
comic book heroes whose fantasy world is a little heavier and less humorous.

FT  05 JUL 93 / China to sell 'peaceful' N-power plant to Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN SAID yesterday that it had signed an agreement to buy from China a
300MW nuclear power station, a development which is certain to be vigorously
opposed by the US.
Although Iran and China both stressed that the nuclear plant would be used
only for peaceful purposes, US officials have claimed several times in the
past year that Tehran is seeking a nuclear weapons capacity.
The Clinton administration has described Iran as the world's foremost
sponsor of international terrorism, and the US is encouraging its allies to
reduce economic links and other co-operation which might assist the Tehran
regime.
Washington sees Iran and its neighbour Iraq as two of the biggest threats to
international stability, and has said that the policy of 'containment'
should apply to them equally.
Iran's deal with China, which also involves a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 666m) line
of credit for the purchase of rolling stock for Tehran's part-built
underground railway, is the biggest bilateral accord Iran has been able to
announce for some time.
President Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has sought to improve Iran's
international image, in an effort to improve access to western finance and
technology.
However, his efforts have been undermined by accusations of terrorism and by
the failure of Iran to meet payments on letters of credit which has led
several countries to reassess their trading relations with Tehran.

VIETNAMESE planners have drawn up a long list of projects in great need of

Power is another problem. Southern Vietnam, in particular, is very short of
the electricity it badly needs to fuel its economic growth. Economists in
Hanoi estimate the southern power shortfall at 20 to 30 per cent. A
transmission line already being built between the north and south of the
country will go some way to alleviate the problem but, as economic
development picks up in the north, there will be less power to send south.
The Asian Development Bank said on Friday it was ready to approve loans
worth Dollars 250m to Vietnam, as soon as the US had lifted its trade
embargo on Hanoi.
Such a move is thought more likely following Mr Clinton's announcement.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Egypt asks US for cleric's extradition: Problems posed for
two governments by an Islamic preacher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT HAS asked the US authorities to extradite Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, an
Islamic preacher based in New Jersey, some of whose followers were arrested
last month in a thwarted terrorist plot in New York.
He is facing trial at his native Fayoum, south of Cairo.
Mr Nagy Ghatrifi, Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman, confirmed a request
had been made for the cleric's extradition, following weekend talks between
Mr Amr Moussa, foreign minister, and the US ambassador in Cairo.
The request has been prompted by the ruling at the weekend by a judge
presiding over the re-trial of the sheikh at Fayoum, where he and more than
40 others are facing charges of inciting and participating in a riot in
1989, when two Egyptian policemen were killed.
Judge Ahmed Izzat Ashmawi ruled that the sheikh must be arrested to face the
re-trial in person. 'We are asking for his extradition because the court has
said he must be here to stand trial,' said Mr Ghatrifi.
Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman denies links with terrorism, either in the US or in
Egypt, but is viewed as spiritual leader of the extremist Gamaa
al-Islamiyya, which claims responsibility for attacks on tourist targets and
security forces in Egypt.
He has openly called for the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak's
government.
Eight of his followers were arrested last month. They are alleged to have
been preparing explosives in an attempt to blow up the UN headquarters and
two road tunnels. A further seven men, also associated either with the
cleric or the New Jersey mosque at which he preached, have been charged in
connection with the February bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York.
Sheikh Abdul-Rahman was acquitted in 1990 concerning the 1989 riot, but the
Egyptian government this year ordered a re-trial under presidential
prerogative. This began in April, and 19 of 48 accused face capital charges.
The sheikh surrendered himself to US immigration authorities last week for
questioning about a deportation order before US courts since March last
year.
US authorities have stressed that his detention is not directly connected
with the Trade Centre bombing, or last month's intercepted terrorist attack,
but it follows much publicity in the US associating the cleric with both
incidents.
Extradition of the sheikh could pose legal and political headaches for Cairo
and Washington. It is unclear whether any effective extradition procedure
exists. For one thing, the countries have no direct extradition treaty, only
an 1874 agreement signed between the US and the Ottoman empire, of which
Egypt was then part.
Also, it is not clear how ardently Egypt wants Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman back
in the country, where he might become a focus for Islamic militants engaged
in a campaign of anti-government violence. Egyptian officials had said that
they did not want the cleric returned.
However, growing pressure in the US to deal with the controversial cleric,
combined with the ruling on Saturday at Fayoum, appear to have forced the
Egyptian government's hand.
Officials may now consider that it would be better to have Sheikh Abdul
Rahman under close scrutiny in Egypt than elsewhere - particularly in the
Sudanese capital Khartoum, from where he flew to the US in 1990 and where he
might have more scope to inspire activity against the government in Cairo.

PAKISTAN'S army denied at the weekend that it sought to intervene in the
country's political crisis, before the 16th anniversary today of the
imposition of martial law by the late General Zia-ul-Haq.
The army insisted in a statement that it was neutral in the bitter six-month
power struggle between President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, and denied that it had urged Mr Sharif to end the dispute or call
elections.
Mr Nisar Ali Khan, petroleum minister and a special assistant to Mr Sharif,
said the army had not raised the need for mid-term elections. But he said
the army had expressed its concern, adding that this anxiety could be
removed if the president were to step down. 'The country can only have
stability if the president leaves office,' he said.
In the latest tensions between Mr Sharif and Mr Ishaq Khan, the government
claims that the president is behind the refusal of the provincial government
in Punjab to comply with a parliamentary resolution imposing direct federal
rule on the province. The battle over the Punjab is now widely seen as the
most difficult test for Mr Sharif.
It was the Punjab which was once seen as Mr Sharif's most important base and
largely responsible for his political rise. Mr Altaf Hussain, provincial
governor and Mr Manzoor Watoo, chief minister, have both defied Islamabad's
initiative to seize control.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Haiti prepares for Aristide

POLITICAL parties in Haiti will meet this week for a conference to prepare
for the restoration of democracy, after exiled President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide and General Raoul Cedras, the army chief, signed an accord on
Saturday night.
The agreement, for which Mr Dante Caputo of Argentina was the United Nations
mediator, provides for Father Aristide to return to Haiti by October 30. Gen
Cedras is to retire from his position as head of the army and be succeeded
by a nominee of the president. The latter will also name a new prime
minister, to be confirmed by Haiti's parliament.
Mr Caputo's 10-point plan also provides for the creation, with foreign
assistance, of a new police force, a presidential amnesty for those involved
in the 1991 coup by which Gen Cedras ousted the president, and suspension of
the economic embargoes against Haiti by the UN and the Organisation of
American States.
The UN's imposition last week of an embargo on oil and arms shipments, as
well a freeze on official financial assets, is thought to have been
important in bringing Gen Cedras to the negotiating table.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday said the US might
contribute forces to police the return to democracy in Haiti, but probably
fewer than 1,000. Most of the forces would probably come from
French-speaking countries, he said.
US assistance is expected to top Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) over the next
five years.
Negotiations for Fr Aristide's return to Haiti have proved long and
difficult, and the mercurial Roman Catholic priest has almost exhausted the
patience of UN and US negotiators. After Gen Cedras had agreed to the deal
on Saturday, it was some hours before the president also signed.
The political impasse in Haiti has created strains in US policy, and the
Clinton administration has exerted much pressure in recent weeks to bring
about a settlement.
President Bill Clinton said during his election campaign last year that he
would reverse President Bush's policy of returning Haitian refugees to their
impoverished land. This year, though, he felt compelled to retreat from his
promise.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Germany faces more pressure to ease interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by the Bundesbank last week to lower the discount rate by half
a percentage point, to 6.75 per cent, will ease the pressure from its
disgruntled partners.
But the summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in
Tokyo this week is still likely to be an uncomfortable occasion for Germany.
Everyone will want to see more easing soon. This is quite understandable,
since the easing so far has not been all that substantial.
This may seem surprising when the discount rate has been cut by two
percentage points since last September, and the repurchase or 'repo' rate
has fallen 2.4 percentage points over the same period.
Yet, by one important measure, German monetary policy has hardly eased at
all. As the chart shows, D-Mark three-month interest rates have remained
above the yield on long bonds since shortly after German monetary union.
France is the only other country shown in the chart for which this has also
been true.
In virtually all market economies, central banks work by changing the price
of money, rather than its quantity. When a central bank makes short-term
interest rates higher than long rates (that is, creates a negatively sloped
yield curve), it normally pushes the exchange rate up. But it also squeezes
financial intermediaries. The mechanisms through which this works include:
Elimination of the profitability of borrowing short and lending long at
fixed rates of interest;
Pushing creditworthy clients to borrow in bond markets instead of from
banks;
Reducing the incentive to borrow at short-term rates of interest and the
profitability of those who must do so;
Lowering desired holdings of inventories.
In the end, traditional credit-creating institutions are by-passed, lending
is reduced, monetary growth falls and the economy goes into recession.
The charts trace the relationship of two significant points on the yield
curve since 1989. They demonstrate how far the monetary policies of the US,
Japan and Germany diverged after 1990. The US eased first, the maximum
degree of easing being reached in the months preceding 'black' Wednesday,
which was also the period of maximum German tightness. As for Japan, it not
only started to ease a year and a half after the US but, judged by the shape
of its yield curve, by rather less.
The divergence between US and German monetary policy, along with the
tightness of the latter, were the main reasons for the months of chaos in
the ERM. The chart shows how the UK was unable to ease monetary policy from
mid-1991, while Italy's policy was sharply tightened in mid-1992. As for
France, it not only suffered tight monetary policy before September 1992,
but tight and highly unstable monetary policy thereafter, reaching relative
calm only in April 1993. Even so, its monetary stance remains far tighter
than those of Italy and the UK today.
This makes little sense. France has low inflation. As the table shows, it
also has a serious industrial recession and rising unemployment. Germany has
experienced a still deeper industrial recession, though it does suffer from
uncomfortably high inflation. As for Italy and the UK, their dismal
industrial performances in 1991 and 1992 show they did need monetary easing.
G7 monetary policy is still in disarray. US monetary policy has been
skilfully handled by the Federal Reserve over the last few years. The same
cannot be said of anyone else's.
The Bundesbank's sins, though real, are at least venial compared to those of
the politicians in Bonn. But the determination of the rest of the EC to
stick to unchanged ERM parities after German unification was a signal error,
one the French seem determined to persist with to the last gasp.
As for the Bank of Japan, its policies were eased too late and too little.
It would be good to think this week's meeting of the G7 will mark the start
of common sense on monetary policy.
Unhappily, the chances are close to zero.

SPORADIC clashes marked a strike called by Nepal's left-wing opposition
yesterday to press for the resignation of Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala, Reuter reports from Kathmandu.
Police said protesters had thrown stones at buses in the capital, Kathmandu.
Police fired in the air to disperse rioters at the border town of Jitpur,
about 90 miles south of Kathmandu, officials said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties in either town. Sunday is a
working day in Nepal, but there was little traffic on the streets and
offices, and shops were closed in response to the strike called by the
Unified Marxist-Leninist party (UML).
The UML organised the strike to back calls for the reopening of an
investigation into the death, in a road accident in May, of Mr Madan
Bhandari, the party leader.
A judicial inquiry last month into the death found no foul play, but the UML
says he was murdered.
A nationwide UML strike on June 25 led to days of violence in the
land-locked Himalayan kingdom. At least 11 people were killed.
The UML says that the agitation will continue until the prime minister has
been dismissed.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Internal disputes hinder Socialist pursuit of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the ruling Liberal Democratic party was brought down last month, Mr
Sadao Yamahana, leader of the country's Socialist party, confidently assured
the US ambassador to Japan that an election win by his party would not
create policy divisions between Tokyo and Washington.
A few days later, with closed-door condemnation from colleagues still
echoing in his ears, Mr Yamahana headed down a different path, explaining
his party 'has its own foreign policies' and will take a different approach
to the US from that of the LDP.
Mr Yamahana's clumsy performance was another sign to Japanese voters that
his party, known as the Social Democratic party in English but still the
Shakaito (Socialist party) in Japanese, has been unable to settle the
ideological disputes which have ensured it is the natural party of
opposition.
After a brief period in office in the late 1940s, the SDP has become the
party the Japanese occasionally vote for when particularly annoyed by the
excesses of the LDP. Following the Recruit scandal four years ago, when
cut-price stocks were swapped for political favours, the party had a
remarkable opportunity to capitalise on dissatisfaction with the LDP.
In the wake of the scandal, Ms Takako Doi led the party into an upper house
election, denying the LDP a majority and heightening expectations of a
similar result in the more powerful lower house. She appeared to have the
authority to change the rigidly leftist policies which had alienated voters:
the embrace of totalitarian North Korea, the refusal to recognise the
existence of the Japanese military, and hostility towards the US.
At that moment Ms Doi may have had the authority, but she did not have the
will. The brilliance soon faded, and the SDP left voters disappointed again.
The party was then humiliated in a 1991 Tokyo gubernatorial election, where
its candidate lost his deposit, and was crushed in a succession of local
government contests.
Wasted chances in the past and the emergence of new political groups have
made Mr Yamahana and other SDP pragmatists realise the party no longer wins
the protest vote. But as his backtracking on US relations showed, the
watering down of traditional policies alienates the party's core supporters.
Both trends were behind the SDP's dismal performance in the Tokyo
metropolitan assembly elections a week ago, when its representatives were
cut from 29 to 14 and the local party chairman and general-secretary lost
their seats.
The SDP reaction was to move both forward and backward. Officials emphasised
there had been no fundamental change in the traditional policies, and also
promised to pursue more pragmatic policies in an attempt to prove the party
was the real alternative to the LDP. One leader suggested that the 'leftists
holding us back can be counted like moles on a body'.
But Mr Yamahana's problem is that most of the moles are in the upper part of
the body. The pragmatists, those uncomfortable with the cosiness towards
North Korea, are said to comprise more than 70 per cent of the party, but
the remaining 30 per cent, the true believers, have an inordinate influence
at the top of the hierarchy and, particularly, on policymaking committees.
The SDP is getting itself in trouble because, on the eve on an election, the
party is debating sensitive policies which should have been resolved over
the past few years. Mr Yamahana, who recently replaced the indecisive Mr
Makoto Tanabe, who in turn took over from the indecisive Ms Doi, finds
himself attempting to hold together a party instead of exploiting the LDP's
weakness.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Parties find common cause in reform: Election pledges of
change will reflect mounting public disquiet over the political system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE next Japanese government will attempt a sweeping reform of Japan's
political system.
Political reform is the main campaign issue for the July 18 general
election. All the opposition parties, old and new, are committed to the
process. And the ruling Liberal Democratic party is almost certain to
endorse it after the election. Last month's no-confidence vote was provoked
by the party's opposition to reform; the government lost and was taught a
painful lesson.
Yet political reform means different things to the various parties.
Proposals range from a limited tightening of regulations on political
funding to measures which could change the way Japan is governed.
Pressure for change has been mounting steadily. The Japanese public has been
growing increasingly disillusioned with corruption and Japan's business and
bureaucratic elites are concerned that the parochial, slow-moving system of
government makes Japan ill-equipped to play a larger international role.
Yet in the short run the debate has stemmed from more base motives. The real
battles of Japanese politics - fierce rivalries between leading politicians
 -are being played out through arguments over reform.
The proposals for change come in three main categories.
Electoral reform. The difficulties of cleaning up political funding have
focused attention on reform of Japan's distinctive electoral system, which
dates from 1925. The electoral system is widely blamed for the corruption
and parochialism of Japanese politics.
The 511-strong lower house of parliament is elected from about 130 large
election districts, most of which return between three and five members of
parliament.
To win a majority a party must run more than one candidate in each district.
So LDP and Social Democratic party candidates compete with one another as
well as against the opposition. To do this they need to maintain expensive,
personal support groups.
As it is difficult for a candidate to be distinguished from party colleagues
by ideology and policy, the candidate usually offers to bring public
spending projects to the constituency. The main qualities most Japanese
politicians offer their electorate are the skills and power to win favours
from the government bureaucracy in Tokyo.
A politician needs the support of about 15 per cent of the electorate to win
a seat, so if he targets his efforts repeatedly at the same sectional
interests he will be re-elected.
The system creates both supply and demand for corruption. The donations come
from construction companies which want politicians to press their case in
bidding for public contracts and politicians want the money to maintain
their local support groups. This does not merely make Japanese politics
corrupt. It minimises the role of policy debates in distinguishing between
candidates.
The multi-member electoral system is a prime target for reform. However, the
proposals largely reflect the interests of the party putting them forward.
The LDP old guard proposed switching to a system of smaller constituencies,
each electing a single member. Their reasoning was simple: as the largest,
richest party the LDP would probably win a majority of the seats.
The younger reformers within the party and the opposition want a system
which mixes 275 single-seat constituencies with a 225-seat proportional
representation system, designed to protect the interests of smaller parties.
A voter would cast two votes, one for their local single-seat constituency
and one in a ballot covering a wider prefectural area by proportional
representation.
It is not easy to predict how such a system would affect the parties'
standings. After the last general election in 1990 the Asahi Shimbun
newspaper published 20 computer simulations of possible outcomes under
different voting systems. The LDP won a resounding victory in all but four
simulations, when the main gains were in the Japan Communist party's favour.
Funding. All parties claim they want tougher controls on political funding
to eliminate widespread corruption in the form of illicit corporate
donations to individual politicians.
Politics in Japan is extremely expensive. Even though LDP candidates are not
allowed to buy television advertising, each spends at least Dollars 500,000
(Pounds 333,300) on their campaign and about Dollars 60,000 a month on
office expenses.
LDP politicians mainly raise this from corporate donations. But even after
sweeping reform of the political funds law in 1975, Japanese politicians
consistently find loopholes in regulations which were meant to clean up
their finances.
The reform limited contributions which could be made to individual
politicians. In response the politicians set up a multitude of supposedly
independent organisations, which receive funds on their behalf. Drinks
parties, the tickets for which sell for about Y30,000 (Pounds 190) a time,
are popular because businesses can treat the tickets as a taxable expense
rather than a political contribution. It is not uncommon for a politician to
sell 2,000 tickets for a hall which only accommodates 900 people.
Reform of political financing will develop in two directions. First,
stricter controls on corporate donations to individual politicians and more
openness in general donations to party organisations. Second, increased
government funding, which is limited to the costs of printing posters and
the running costs of a campaign car.
Urban voters. Japan's urban voters, who tend to be more cosmopolitan and
less influenced by pork barrel politics, are significantly under-represented
in the parliament. The disparities between rural and urban seats are huge.
In the last election Kanagawa District Four had 336,859 voters per MP, while
Miyazaki District Four had 105,939. At the extreme, one rural vote was worth
three urban votes. Some candidates won with only 45,000 votes while others
lost with 122,000.
The over-representation of rural districts is estimated to give the LDP a
30-seat advantage. The Social Democratic party is also more strongly
represented in rural areas than in cities.
Rebalancing the electoral districts so that urban voters are fairly
represented would shift the balance of power in favour of younger centrist
parties such as Komeito and the Japan New Party and away from both
traditional parties.
The combination of political reform, the LDP's split, declining urban
support for the Socialists and the rise of new centrist parties could change
the map of Japanese politics.
Yet there will be important continuities. The local, highly personalised
character of Japanese politics is like the root system of a tree. It is
deeply embedded in Japanese society and will not change quickly.

JAPAN: MAKING THE CHOICE
 ------------------------------------------------------
Population:                          123m
Electorate:                         93.4m
Parliamentary seats (lower house):   511
 ------------------------------------------------------
THE LEFT
 ------------------------------------------------------
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Sadao Yamahana
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party still known in Japanese as the Socialist party:
the name change in English was easier than changes to
the party's Marxist/Leninist-flavoured policies. Party
pragmatists want fresh policies and hope to form a
vaguely left-of-centre government. Party idealogues see
ruling as irrelevant but are proudly devoted to
traditional beliefs.
 ------------------------------------------------------
JAPAN COMMUNST PARTY
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Tetsuzo Fuwa
 ------------------------------------------------------
The least corruptible party because it is funded by
individual contributions rather than corporations.
Continues to defy history by espousing Marxism, and
electoral logic by running a candidate in every
district regardless of their prospects. The latter
helps to take votes away from the other opposition
parties, who cold-shoulder it.
 ------------------------------------------------------
THE CENTRE
 ------------------------------------------------------
KOMEITO (CLEAN GOVERNMENT PARTY)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Koshiro Ishida
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party created by the Buddhist movement Soka Gakkai to
represent its political interests. Now claims
independence but closely linked to the movement.
Conservative in nature. Assured of the votes of the
Buddhist faithful, so tends to do relatively well if
election turnout low. Close to LDP factions and has
supported ruling party on important issues.
 ------------------------------------------------------
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Keigo Ouchi
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party originally an offshoot from the Socialist Party
but has acted much like a faction of the ruling LDP.
Policies are indistinct but generally conservative.
Party members tend to support the LDP when it needs
extra parliamentary voting numbers. Has in the past
attracted LDP voters wanting to register mild rebuke to
the government.
 ------------------------------------------------------
SHAMINREN (UNITED SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Satsuki Eda
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party is small pro-reform group trying to broaden its
power base by poaching members of the SDP, which is
frustrated by its inability to reform itself. Eda, one
of a long line of political Edas, has established a
separate political study group Sirius with SDP members.
This grouping could become yet another new party.
 ------------------------------------------------------
THE RIGHT
 ------------------------------------------------------
LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (LDP)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Kiichi Miyazawa
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party has held power since its formation in 1955
through the merger of two conservative parties. Its
anti-communism and willingness to shelter beneath the
umbrella of US foreign policy have been as enduring as
its symbiotic relationship with business and the
bureaucracy, the fierce rivalry among the leaders of
its warring factions and its recurrent financial
scandals.
 ------------------------------------------------------
SHINSEITO (JAPAN RENEWAL PARTY)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Tsutomu Hata
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party formed last month by rebel LDP faction that
brought down government in no-confidence motion. Hata,
the former finance minister, is popular, but his
offsider, Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP fund manager, is
regared with suspicion. Party is middle-of-road but
perhaps slightly to the right. Still, it talks of
coalition with Socialists.
 ------------------------------------------------------
JAPAN NEW PARTY
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Morihiro Hosokawa
 ------------------------------------------------------
Hosokawa, popularly known as Lord Hosokawa, is the
scion of one of Japan's oldest families and the darling
of the media. He calls for a 'power shift' to break up
Japanese politics but is short on specific policies. He
is close to the New Harbinger Party and loathes Ichiro
Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party)
 ------------------------------------------------------
NEW HARBINGER PARTY
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Masayoshi Takemura
 ------------------------------------------------------
Splinter group formed last month from the LDP. The
Party has been searching for coalition partners, as its
10 parliamentarians felt vulnerable after their exit
from the ruling party. Policies are similar to LDP,
though the party has been purposefully vague,
suggesting that it is 'neither for or against the LDP'.

One seat has been cut from the house of representatives, leaving 511
seats up for election this time. The LDP had 275 seats when the lower
house was dissolved on June 18. Of the 275 members, 48 have since left
the party.

FT  05 JUL 93 / White gloves mark start of election bout

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S politicians slipped on the white gloves and mounted their
loudspeaker vans yesterday for the official start of an election campaign
which is expected to end with the ruling Liberal Democratic party losing its
control over the country.
The LDP and opposition parties presume that the July 18 election will lead
to the formation of coalition government, which could hinder Japan's ability
to respond to trade issues and delay a forecast recovery of the economy.
LDP officials are already courting opposition parties, but the head of the
Japan New Party, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who is likely to make or break a new
government, said voters had a unique opportunity to 'say sayonara to the
LDP'.
The election was called after the LDP lost a motion of no-confidence,
proposed after the party had stalled reforms to a scandal-stained political
system, provoking one of its own factions to vote for the motion and then
form a new party, the Japan Renewal party.
Heads of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations meeting in Tokyo
this week will find themselves surrounded by the campaign. They will be
greeted by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, in a mood to show
Japanese voters that he is a leader of international stature.
Mr Miyazawa launched the LDP campaign yesterday by warning that the country
would be led into chaos by a coalition headed by the Social Democratic
party, formerly known as the Japan Socialist party. Japanese politicians,
some with no sense of irony, wear white gloves to prove they are clean.
'Will the Socialists close nuclear power plants? What will they do about our
important neighbour, South Korea?' asked Mr Miyazawa, referring to unsettled
policy issues in the SDP, which is attempting to hitch its campaign to the
popular demand for political reform.
Most politicians said the campaign marked the beginning of a 'new era' in
Japanese government, which the LDP has dominated since its formation in
1955. But defections have left the party with only 285 candidates competing
for 511 seats, suggesting it is unlikely to muster a maj-ority.
The SDP is fielding only 142 candidates so it, too, will need to find
partners to form a new government. There are many potential coalitions, with
the JNP perhaps aligning with the LDP, if the party dumps Mr Miyazawa and
appoints a new leader with better reform credentials.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister and LDP rebel who formed the
JRP, campaigning in bare hands, said Japanese voters had an 'appointment
with destiny' at this election: 'We have to change the Japanese political
system and that change must come now.'

FT  05 JUL 93 / Professor Gerald Curtis offers opinions on Japanese
political funding reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Gerald Curtis, probably the foremost western commentator on
Japanese politics, offers this judgment about how Japanese politicians
responded to the 1975 reform of political funding: 'Japanese politicians
rose to the challenge posed by these reforms by searching out every
conceivable loophole in the law that might allow them to avoid having to
change their time-tried ways of doing things.
'The reforms offered eloquent testimony to the difficulty of engineering
political change in a society that has resilient political institutions and
traditions.
'They demonstrated not only that the consequences of reform cannot be
entirely anticipated, but that they often exacerbate the problems they are
intended to correct and create others that are worse.'

FT  05 JUL 93 / Tokyo attempts to smooth path to G7 summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government has offered to use a variety of indicators to
measure its efforts to reduce the current account surplus, in an attempt to
prevent trade frictions with the US souring this week's Tokyo summit of
heads of state from the Group of Seven industrialised nations.
Japan would set the criteria to be used, which would flow from the
government's normal economic forecasts. Tokyo insists the indicators would
not amount to targets to reduce the surplus or increase imports, nor should
the indicators be binding commitments which could invite sanctions from the
US if they were not met. The US has been pressing Japan for two months to
agree a new framework for trade talks which would include numerical targets
in opening up the Japanese market and cutting the current account surplus,
which could reach Dollars 150bn (Pounds 100bn) this year. The US wants these
targets to be set and reviewed jointly, while Tokyo argues this would
infringe its right to run its domestic economic policies.
Talks over the framework broke up a week ago without a date for the next
round of discussions.
The Japanese proposals, which were hurriedly put together in the past few
days, reflect the concerns of senior Japanese diplomats that Japan and the
US should not be seen to be seriously at odds over trade during the summit.
The main economic issues on the G7 agenda are world growth and unemployment;
trade, focusing on the stalled Uruguay Round of liberalisation talks; and
help for Russia. President Bill Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese
prime minister, are due to agree the trade talks framework at a bilateral
meeting this week.
The Japanese strongly oppose the US plan for numerical targets which, they
argue, would require the government to guarantee a share of the domestic
market for foreign producers. Part of the opposition may reflect the
political turmoil in the country in the run up to the general election on
July 18. The government's weakness has emboldened bureaucrats at the
powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry to harden their
opposition to the use of numerical measures.
However, officials in the Foreign Ministry are concerned that the country
should not be seen to be rudderless over the most controversial issues in
its relations with the US.
The Japanese offer will at least allow Mr Clinton and Mr Miyazawa to rebut
claims the talks have broken down.
The plan will not in itself satisfy US demands enough to provide the basis
for a deal, although it is a step towards the US position. In Washington, Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said he wanted to 'lower
expectations' of a bilateral trade agreement between the US and Japan. The
proposals were 'worth discussing on our part. . . Whether we can draw close
enough together is an open question,' he said in a television interview
yesterday.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Italians agree new labour deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW national Italian labour agreement was reached on Saturday after 40
days of negotiations between the government, Confindustria - the
Confederation of Italian Industries - and the unions.
The agreement provides a new framework for industrial relations and wages
bargaining following last year's abolition of the Scala Mobile, the cost of
living-linked automatic wages escalator established in 1945.
Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said the agreement 'certainly
contributes' to improving the conditions for the lira's return to the
European Monetary System. And though he would not comment directly on the
prospects of a reduction in the Italian bank rate, a drop of half or one
point in the interest rate was widely expected by economists.
The agreement's main points include:
A four year national contract to regulate labour relations. Wage increases
to be kept within the projected inflation rate and reviewed every two years
in light of effective inflation.
Individual companies to raise wages only if they have made profits, and on
the basis of productivity increases.
Government, employers and unions will meet twice a year to define common
objectives on inflation, GNP and employment levels.
Once a national contract has expired and in the period in which a new one is
being negotiated, only limited increases will be allowed for inflation. The
hiring of trainees and apprentices will be simplified. Companies will also
be able to hire staff on a temporary basis from new agencies to be created
to 'rent out' labour.
Labour Minister Gino Giugni termed the agreement a 'constitution for
industrial relations' which brought Italy closer to the northern European
model for industrial bargaining. It would, he said, have positive effects on
inflation, employment and public finances. The parts regarding trainees and
apprentices and temporary workers were alone expected to create 200,000
jobs.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Exchange rates main factor in European car price
comparisons: The European Market - European motorists are paying not for
profiteering but for the industry's lack of competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On May 1 this year Italy and Spain were easily the cheapest markets in which
to buy most new car models, according to the first comparative European
Community price lists for selected new cars, published last week at the
behest of the European Commission.
A year earlier, the Commission's own study showed Spain as the highest
priced market, with Italy third highest.
Early last year UK consumer groups were vocal in their condemnation of the
excessively high prices asked of British motorists; Last week's lists show
the British market to be the cheapest in Europe for many executive and
luxury cars, and about the EC average for many 'ordinary' vehicles. What has
happened to change the picture?
The answer to the past year's price upheavals disclosed by the lists is to
be found almost entirely within the currency markets - as the Brussels-based
industry lobby group, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association,
leaped to point out the moment the comparisons were published.
What they have demonstrated conclusively, the EAMA trumpets, is that it is
unrealistic to make meaningful price comparisons - let alone have
'harmonised' prices - when some currencies remain so volatile. Between July
last year and the middle of May, the main EMS currencies - German, French,
Belgian, Dutch and Danish - rose 22 per cent against the lira (briefly
touching 32 per cent in April), 20 per cent against the peseta, 17 per cent
against sterling and 15 per cent against the Portuguese escudo.
'Manufacturers - particularly non-local manufacturers - cannot be expected
to make instant double-digit price changes,' the EAMA contends.
The lists come as close as possible to comparing 'like for like' in terms of
models and prices. They provide information on 55 European and 17 Japanese
popular models, based on recommended retail prices, adjusted for equipment
differences and with prices given in local currencies both before and after
tax. Supplements for options such as air conditioning and power steering are
given, as well as the premium for right-hand-drive models for the UK market.
Differentials are arrived at by converting the local currency prices into
Ecus. As an EC-wide comparison, the lists have inbuilt compromises. One is
that they take no account of the widely varying discounts available in
individual markets.
More important, the lists exclude Denmark and Greece, because local taxation
 -of over 100 per cent - is seen as excessively depressing pre-tax prices.
But Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal are included even though national
taxation in each can add 50 per cent to the cost of a new car.
Manufacturers selling in these countries, too, have a strong incentive to
keep pre-tax prices down in order not to have tax-inclusive prices beyond
the reach of consumers. Given such an obvious distortion, the Commission
indicated after last year's report that governments with such high tax
regimes would have to be 'leaned on' to reduce such large obstacles to the
internal EC trade in cars.
But so far, there is no real sign that Brussels is doing any leaning. And
until there is, the underlying probability remains that one government's
high tax take on a car, and the manufacturer's low pre-tax price in that
market in order to sell it, stand to be subsidised by a higher pre-tax price
(and fatter manufacturer profit margin) in relatively low-tax countries like
the UK, where the only tax now paid on a new car purchase is the standard
17.5 per cent VAT.
And that consideration underlines the biggest flaw in the EC's drive for
price 'transparency'. The lists should let consumers see at a glance roughly
what they can expect to pay for given models in Europe's main markets and
where they might most fruitfully go for the best deal. Thus they now know
that, for example, that there is no point going to Germany to buy an Audi
100, because it is cheaper in the UK than anywhere else. On the other hand,
they could save up to 35 per cent by buying various Fiats, Rovers, Vauxhalls
and Volkswagens in Italy.
And with even consumer groups acknowledging that manufacturers are being
less obstructive towards private cross-border purchases, taking advantage of
cheaper markets should be no problem. But the lists cannot tell consumers
what they should pay in each market, based on the fundamentals of
manufacturers and their dealers receiving an equitable return on investment.
Not surprisingly, no manufacturer wants to disclose its exact profit - or
loss - margin on each car in individual markets, particularly if, as is
almost certainly the case, low-tax countries are shown to be higher-margin
ones. But given the sea of red ink washing over most European producers, the
tendency of consumer groups to see profiteering round every corner strikes a
jarring note with many industry analysts.
As a number of studies have already shown, European car prices as a whole
are high measured against those of Japan and North America. What this year's
plunge in the European new car market has exposed is the signal failure of
much of Europe's car industry properly to attack costs and efficiency during
the boom years of the 1980s.
The bottom line appears to be that Europe's motorists are paying the price
not of profiteering but of the European industry's lack of competitiveness
and the disparities in EC taxation and currency regimes.

FT  05 JUL 93 / German minister quits over shootout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rudolf Seiters, Germany's federal interior minister, yesterday resigned
after coming under mounting pressure from the media and politicians for his
handling of a shootout between German police and suspected left-wing
terrorists.
The resignation brings to 20 the number of ministers who have quit
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governments since he came to power in 1982.
Six ministers have resigned since the beginning of the year, highlighting
the internal problems the centre-right coalition faces as it prepares for
re-election next year.
The government's public image recently suffered a setback when Mr Theo
Waigel, the federal finance minister, announced his willingness to leave the
cabinet if he was chosen to replace former Bavarian premier Max Streibl.
Mr Seiters and Mr Alexander von Stahl, the federal prosecutor, have been
under attack for not disclosing the exact circumstances under which Mr
Wolfgang Grams, a suspected member of the Red Army Faction, died last
Sunday.
Mr Seiters said he was taking personal responsibility for the 'mistakes, the
lack of clarity and of co-ordination in the police'.
Reports in the German media, based on the accounts of witnesses, allege that
police shot Mr Grams at point-blank range when he was on the floor and
unarmed.
Der Spiegel, the German weekly magazine, quoted a police officer as saying
that 'the killing was like an execution'.
Earlier in the week the Interior Ministry had said Mr Grams had been shot at
from a distance of 1.5 metres. It had called the arrest a model of
anti-terrorist action.
The German media have also questioned whether Mr Michael Newrzella, an
anti-terrorist police officer who died in the shootout, was killed by the
suspected terrorist or by a colleague. Mr Gerhard Kohler, vice-president of
the federal criminal office, yesterday denied he was killed by police.
Mr Seiters, a Christian Democrat, has been in the spotlight recently because
of his role in trying to contain violence against foreigners. He was also
instrumental in pushing through the legislative amendment which has
toughened the country's previously liberal asylum law.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Azeri town set to fall to Armenia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARMENIAN forces from the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday closed in
on the Azerbaijan town of Agdam which came under heavy shelling and is now
likely to fall within the next 24 hours.
The defenders of the town, the bridgehead of Azeri defences, have been told
by the Azeri government to hold the town at all costs. However, they say
that only 250 poorly armed reinforcements have been sent from Baku.
Almost all the villages around the town are now in Armenian hands and there
is only one road out for the Azeris. The route is choked with refugees,
mainly women, children and old men fleeing from the stricken town. According
to Agdam officials last night the Armenians are already in the city suburbs.
Shelling and small arms fire is continuous in and around the city centre and
the defenders say there is little or no ammunition left for the few tanks
they have.
Mr Alsif Sherimov, the deputy mayor, said yesterday that some 14 villages
had been taken by the Armenian forces. He also said it now seemed impossible
to hold the town. The new Azeri prime minister, Suret Guseinov, issued an
urgent appeal for all men with military training to report for duty soon or
face punishment.
'All Azeri soldiers must report for duty by July 8. Those who do not obey
this call will face the heaviest punishment,' he said in the appeal read for
him on television.
Mr Guseinov, who became premier last week after heading an army revolt
against elected President Abulfaz Elchibey, said that able-bodied men should
not join the column of refugees now streaming towards Baku.
The town hospital has been emptied of wounded who have joined the women and
children in trucks and farm carts leaving the city. All around the villages
are burning and the suburbs of the town are the site of pitched battles
between the defenders and Armenian attackers.
Mr Sherimov and his colleagues said they would attempt to hold the town as
long as possible.

SERB forces yesterday pounded Sarajevo, the besieged Bosnian capital, as
fighting between Croat and Moslem forces erupted on new fronts in central
Bosnia, Laura Silber reports from Belgrade.
Sarajevo radio reported that Serb artillery shelled several government-held
parts of the battered capital. The bombardment followed the heaviest day of
shelling in several weeks. United Nations monitors said over 1,000
projectiles landed on Serb-held and Moslem-held parts of the capital on
Saturday.
Fierce fighting raged around Moslem-held Maglaj and Zavidovici yesterday,
and Croat forces reported heavy civilian and military casualties in the
battle for the central Bosnian towns. The Croat forces (HVO) in Zagreb said
that the 111th HVO Brigade had lost 40 dead and 100 wounded in recent
fighting for the Maglaj salient 50 miles north of Sarajevo.
Relief workers yesterday warned of an impending 'catastrophe' in Sarajevo.
Supplies of food and medicine have dwindled and conditions have
deteriorated. Relief officials have expressed concern about outbreaks of
typhoid and dysentery because there is no electricity to pump water.
In Banja Luka in the north-west Serbs pressed on with their campaign of
terror against Moslems by blowing up four mosques, two of which dated from
the 16th century. Ten out of 16 mosques around Banja Luka have been mined
over the past year in the Serb stronghold.
Bosnian radio said Croat forces yesterday began shelling Fojnica, about 25
miles northwest of Sarajevo. Croat radio accused Moslem fighters of starting
the clashes. The Moslem-led army need to control the strategic towns of
central Bosnia in order to link up territory to the bigger strongholds of
Zenica and Tuzla.
UN monitors said fighting also continued around Mostar, to the south-west.

<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday predicted that his
economic regeneration plans should start to halt the rise in unemployment by
the end of this year.
The prime minister said in a television interview that he planned to table
legislation this autumn to liberalise France's notoriously strict labour
laws. The reforms will include measures to reduce working hours, cut costs
for employers and boost youth training schemes.
Mr Balladur plans to continue his job creation theme in the 1994 budget by
reducing employers' contributions to family allowance payments, thereby
making it cheaper for them to hire new staff. Other measures will include
cuts in income tax in an attempt to stimulate the recession-struck French
economy.
He also confirmed that the special government bond issue launched 10 days
ago to finance his existing job creation programme had been 'very well
received'. The issue, which is expected to raise at least FFr40bn (Pounds
4.7bn), is being heavily marketed as a precursor to the government's
privatisation programme.
The proceeds of the issue will be ploughed into the FFr63bn economic
regeneration package that Mr Balladur unveiled after his centre-right
coalition took office in late March. The prime minister said those measures
should start to take effect 'around December or January'.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Ireland faces pressure over EC regional aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government will this week come under strong pressure from its
partners to lift its veto on the European Community's biggest regional
development programme, worth Ecu157bn (Pounds 121.4bn) for 1994-99.
After 17 hours of often ugly disputes among the 12 on Friday and early
Saturday morning over how to divide the spoils, Ireland blocked a deal. It
held out for its full target of IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) against the
IPounds 7.5bn it was offered.
Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, which now holds the EC
presidency, said 'I'm waiting for a signal from the Irish government',
reminding Dublin that it was blocking a package 'three times greater than
the global Marshall Plan' of US aid to reconstruct post-second world war
Europe.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he had firm pledges of
IPounds 8bn immediately after last December's EC summit in Edinburgh, where
the size of the package, but not how to divide it, was agreed. Since then he
has been under intense domestic political pressure to deliver.
Unlike Spain, however, which got written assurances from the European
Commission for the Pta6,400bn (Pounds 33bn) it now expects to get, Ireland's
understanding was oral. Per capita, Dublin in the last share-out got 2 to 2
1/2 times more than Spain, Portugal and Greece, with which it makes up the
so-called 'Cohesion Four' of the poorest member states.
Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign minister, looking drawn at 4am on Saturday
after protracted telephone negotiations with Mr Reynolds, said: 'We were
looking for assurances based on the understanding at Edinburgh, and they
were not forthcoming. In the national interest, we felt we had no choice.'
If the impasse is not broken this week, the rules governing the aid
programme will miss their second reading by the European Parliament next
week and be cast into a far longer procedure.
This means the aid will almost certainly not start flowing in January.
Nevertheless, the shape of the deal for Ireland's partners is emerging, even
though the weekend negotiations were supposedly only on the framework.
Objective 1 regions, which get the best aid terms and biggest grants
reserved for the EC's most backward areas, will get Ecu96.3bn. The 'Cohesion
Four' will get Ecu70bn of this, plus an additional Ecu15.5bn from a separate
Cohesion Fund which has already started up.
The UK, the next poorest member state, got Merseyside and the Scottish
Highlands and Islands included in Objective 1, with the latter accepted at
the last minute as the whole 'enterprise area' it encompasses, including
therefore Argyll, Bute and West Moray. Northern Ireland was already
eligible. But with this coup, and adding in its other funding entitlements,
the UK could get Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn over the next six years.
Cantabria in northern Spain, and Hainaut in southern Belgium, like
Merseyside traditionally industrial areas, were also reclassified as
backward. France thereby secured Objective 1 status for its Valenciennes and
Sambre-Avesnois areas bordering Hainaut, arguing that their problems were
structurally identical even though they are not recognised as a department.
Inventing a French Hainaut, a Frenchofficial said unimprovably, was 'an
existential problem.'
Germany got its eastern states eligible for Objective 1 funding as part of
the Edinburgh deal. But other stricken areas across the EC will get lesser
Objective 2 structural aid grants, for areas in industrial decline. The UK,
which opposed spending part of the package's money for training the
unemployed on instead retraining workers in danger of losing jobs because of
industrial restructuring,got the latter portion reduced from a third to a
fifth of the still undecided total.

FT  05 JUL 93 / France wants world ban on nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN, DAVID WHITE and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday responded to President Bill Clinton's decision to suspend
US nuclear testing by calling for a global ban on tests. A statement from
President Francois Mitterrand's office said France was 'in favour of a
treaty banning tests completely providing it is universal and verifiable'.
The French have not carried out any nuclear tests since the former Socialist
government suspended them in April last year. However, nuclear planners are
seeking a series of tests on two new submarine-launched weapons, the M45 and
M5. French tests are undertaken at Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific.
In addition, prime minister Edouard Balladur has come under pressure from
right-wing members of his centre-right coalition government to resume
testing. The National Assembly finance committee last week approved a paper
calling for the resumption of tests.
Mr Balladur yesterday said on French television that he was 'in complete
agreement' with Mr Mitterrand. He said he and Mr Mitterrand planned to 'put
our minds at rest' by forming a group of military and scientific experts to
ensure that France's nuclear deterrent did not suffer as a result of the
suspension of tests.
British ministers say the UK can 'live with' a US test ban as long as it
receives assistance in computer simulation techniques to replace live tests.
The UK has to follow Washington's policy, since it relies on the US test
site in Nevada.
The UK Ministry of Defence said it had no plans to test elsewhere and would
seek further consultations with the US. British planners are believed to
want tests to update the WE-177 gravity bomb, which will have to stay in
service beyond the end of the century, and to perfect safety features on the
UK warhead for the Trident submarine-launched missile. However, the main
programme of Trident warhead tests is complete.
Limited further testing need not prejudice progress towards a comprehensive
test ban treaty, the ministry said. Britain has recently taken a more
positive stance towards a complete ban, after previously only paying lip
service to the idea as a 'long-term objective'.
In the US Mr Sig Hecker, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
made clear he had wanted to carry on testing right up to the implementation
of a comprehensive test ban.
'We would have preferred more time to prepare for the test ban,' he said.
The nuclear laboratories have argued that they needed more tests to improve
the safety of the US's nuclear arsenal.
After a divisive debate in the administration, pitting the Pentagon, the
State Department and the nuclear weapons laboratories against the Energy
Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the White House had
initially come down in favour of nine further tests - three of which would
have been British - in the next three years.
Mr Clinton's ultimate decision to extend the moratorium on tests, unless
another nation resumes testing, reflects belated recognition of the
political reality that both the House of Representatives and, more
surprisingly, the Senate remained solidly opposed to more tests.
The decision to extend the moratorium will, however, provide comfort to
Russia, whose Foreign Ministry on Friday called for urgent discussions 'to
achieve a verifiable international agreement that will totally ban nuclear
testing'.

Leaders of Europe's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.6bn) machine tool industry -
parts of which are suffering their worst-ever recession - are seeking help
from the European Commission to stave off competition from Japan and the US,
reports Andrew Baxter.
Cecimo, the umbrella body for 12 European machine tool associations, has
submitted a paper on a possible industrial policy for the sector to the
Commission's DG III division, which covers internal market and industrial
policy issues.
The document, due to be unveiled in September, represents the first attempt
to create what Cecimo calls 'a genuine unified European machine tool sector
and not 12 countries looking at their own navel'.

Phillips Petroleum Norway is to seek substantial tax concessions before it
invests Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in new petroleum production and
processing facilities at the ageing North Sea Ekofisk field, hub of the
world's largest petroleum transportation system, Karen Fossli writes from
Oslo.
Phillips has unveiled a plan to avert closure of the 20-year-old field by
Norwegian authorities, who are concerned over its safety. The US-based oil
company has spent an estimated NKr70bn (Pounds 6.5bn) on the 10-platform
field since it came on stream in 1972.
Last October the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), the oil industry
watchdog, warned it would close the main processing and transportation
facilities on the Ekofisk storage tank, through which 40 per cent of
Norway's petroleum production passes, by the winter of 1995-96, for safety
reasons.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Scarman calls for inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD SCARMAN, the former law lord, yesterday called for an independent
inquiry into the Nadir affair as a fresh row surfaced over allegations of a
Pounds 3.5m conspiracy to bribe the Old Bailey judge handling Mr Nadir's
fraud trial.
Lord Scarman said: 'Nothing that has been revealed so far gives any guidance
to the truth. The only thing that has emerged is the necessity for a public
inquiry. The matters which have been raised are much too serious.'
A majority of MPs share the government's view that parliament should not
interfere in the running of criminal justice.
However, responding to the attorney-general's public refusal last week to
order an inquiry, Lord Scarman said the government had yet to produce
'irresistible answers to a number of questions', including questions about
the conduct of the inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office and the allegations
concerning Mr Nadir himself.
'Unless the government comes forward with an an absolutely transparent
reason why the matter should be taken no further . . . the public should
know the truth,' he said.
Mr Nadir yesterday renewed his public onslaught against the SFO and the
police, accusing them of conducting a campaign of 'disinformation' designed
to discredit him.
In a statement issued to the Press Association from northern Cyprus, where
he is a fugitive from British justice, Mr Nadir said: 'At no time whatsoever
have I been involved in a plot to bribe Mr Justice Tucker.'
His solicitors, Pannone and Partners of Manchester, broke with the normal
legal practice of not commenting publicly on a criminal case subject to
trial, claiming that the latest bribery allegations 'hit directly at the
criminal judicial system'.
They added: 'Media speculation should not be allowed to continue. The
government should immediately set up an independent judicial inquiry to
establish the true facts.'
The Sunday Times yesterday reported on the alleged plot to bribe Judge
Tucker, based on what the newspaper called 'confidential transcripts of
Nadir's pre-trial hearings earlier this year; a Serious Fraud Office legal
document; and notes of an interview between Nadir and Scotland Yard
officers'.
Lord Scarman argued that while an inquiry might prejudice Mr Nadir's trial,
it might still be considered 'to be in the overriding public interest to
hold one'.
The former chairman of Nissan UK, Mr Octav Botnar, yesterday pledged to
return to the UK to face trial over allegations of tax fraud 'as soon as I
can'.
Mr Botnar, recovering from cancer at his home in Lausanne, Switzerland, told
BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'If I would not do it, I would lose
my self-respect.' He insisted he was innocent and also claimed he had
donated only Pounds 90,000 to the Tories, not Pounds 1m as some newspapers
have claimed.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Defendants face abolition of right to elect trial by jury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABOLITION of a def-endant's right to elect trial by jury will be
recommended tomorrow in a report by the Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice.
At the moment, defendants are allowed to choose jury trial in cases which
can be tried either by magistrates or in a crown court.
Sources within the Criminal Bar who have seen the commission's report said
the commission had been convinced that allowing defendants to elect jury
trial only to have them plead guilty at the crown court was a waste of court
time and resources.
According to one QC this proposal will cause a political storm. Mrs Barbara
Mills QC, the director of public prosecutions, has been pushing for the
change. But Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice, is strongly opposed,
describing the right to jury trial as 'an inalienable right stretching back
to the Magna Carta'.
The commission, chaired by Lord Runciman, will also recommend that
defendants must disclose their defence before trial once the case against
them has been outlined by the prosecution. The commission makes a number of
suggestions as to how such an obligation might be enforced, and appears to
favour holding defendants who refuse to co-operate in contempt with the
ultimate sanction of being jailed.
These measures are seen by criminal barristers as the most controversial
proposals in the report.
'I think it is a reasonably solid report,' said one QC, 'not very exciting -
it's not revamping anything. But that's not a bad thing. It would be fatal
to go for too radical change when the system works well in general.'
The commission, which was set up in March 1991 after a series of
miscarriages of justice had rocked public confidence in the criminal justice
system, has stopped short of recommending abolition of the so-called right
to silence of the accused.
Although it will recommend that defendants should disclose their case, and
that juries should be able to draw inferences from the defendant's silence
at trial, it says that the accused should not lose the right to stay silent
at the police station.
The Runciman report also concludes that there is no need for a requirement
that confession evidence should be corroborated before it can be admissable
as evidence at trial. Instead, the commission will recommend that judges
should give a warning to juries about placing too much emphasis on a
confession which is unsupported by other evidence. Similar warnings are
already given to juries about identification evidence.
Among the other recommendations, the commission calls for:
An independent tribunal to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and
refer cases back to the Appeal Court;
A system of sentence discounts, where judges will outline a maximum sentence
a defendant would receive if he pleaded guilty;
An independent forensic science service available to both defence and
prosecution.

FT  05 JUL 93 / Smith heads for confrontation over unions' block vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH has set himself on a collision course with the trade unions at
this autumn's Labour conference by refusing to moderate plans to reduce
their collective role in the party's decision-making.
In an interview with the Financial Times, the Labour leader underlined his
determination to ensure that union participation in the selection of the
party's parliamentary candidates could be exercised only through the
individual party membership of trade unionists.
This one-member, one-vote principle has already been rejected by a majority
of trade unions. The TGWU, the largest union affiliated to the party, will
this week join others in insisting that, as Labour's paymasters, they must
retain a collective voice in the choice of candidates.
But Mr Smith said: 'I did not become leader of the Labour party just to do
easy things. I have the responsibility as leader to do what I think is
right. And I will do it. It's my job to seek to persuade people.' He added:
'I am under no illusions that it's an easy battle to win but I am determined
to win it.'
Despite the threat of a humiliating defeat at the party conference, where
the unions hold 70 per cent of the votes, Mr Smith insisted a decision could
not be deferred for a further year: 'I will fight on . . . I hope I will
succeed in persuading people to adopt it at the conference.'
Mr Smith rejected a compromise floated by some unions which would give votes
only to those trade unionists who paid the political levy to their unions
and were willing to sign a register of Labour supporters. Instead he wants
individual trade unionists to join the party.
'We have got to have people who choose to be members of the party,' he said.
He agreed this would mean that they would have to pay another fee in
addition to the political levy (an average of Pounds 1.70 per person).
The incentives for trade unionists to join the party directly would include
a significant cut in the Pounds 18 annual party membership fee. Stressing
the need for greater democracy, he added: 'It is not just one-member one
vote. It is a lot more members and a lot more votes.'
Mr Smith predicted his plan would have strong support from the constituency
delegations at the conference. But with those delegations accounting for
only 30 per cent of the vote, he is relying on a last-minute retreat by the
unions, and on inter-union divisions, to avoid a damaging defeat.
Mr Smith was keeping open the possibility of a compromise in his separate
dispute with the unions over their role in the election of the party leader.
He was ready to consider the possibility that the unions' representation in
the electoral college, which chooses the leader, could be calculated on the
basis of the unions' proposed register of Labour supporters.
David Goodhart writes: Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU party, yesterday
strongly reaffirmed the union's hostility to Mr Smith's reforms.
He said there was 'absolutely no need' to change the current constitutional
relationship and the debate was just a 'distraction'. But he suggested a new
argument for delaying the decision for one year if Boundaries Commission
changes enable parliamentary selections to be deferred.
The union is unlikely to regard Mr Smith's clarification of his position on
electing the party leader as an important concession. One official said last
night: 'We care much more about the selection of candidates, we have always
been involved in that.'

FT  05 JUL 93 / Nadir took up to Pounds 565m from PPI: Little of the money
seems likely to be recovered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Asil Nadir misappropriated what could be as much as Pounds 565m from
banks, bondholders and shareholders in the last few years of his
chairmanship of Polly Peck International to fund a wide range of his
personal and business interests.
As the battle over the conduct of the case against Mr Nadir continues to
rage, a Financial Times investigation has identified how the fugitive
businessman removed Pounds 371m from the group in the three years leading up
to the Serious Fraud Office raids in 1990.
At least another Pounds 194m or more remains unaccounted for and could
possibly also have been misappropriated. Mr Nadir jumped bail and fled to
northern Cyprus in May.
The analysis, based on writs, creditors' reports, company documents and
interviews with employees and investigators, shows for the first time the
complex movements of funds out of the Nadir business empire into his private
activities.
Most of the money which was misdirected for Mr Nadir's own purposes came
from more than Pounds 1bn raised for PPI in loans, rights issues and bond
issues in the UK, Switzerland and other financial centres before his company
went into administration in October 1990.
Mr Nadir - with the alleged help of a small group of associates in London
and northern Cyprus - then switched the money in and out of a number of the
group's bank accounts in several countries before using it to:
Buy about Pounds 100m of PPI shares through a series of Swiss and Jersey
trusts, most of which were not disclosed.
Prop up loss-making businesses, principally in Turkey and Cyprus
Buy hotels in Cyprus, help purchase two stately homes in England and furnish
his properties with valuable antiques.
Create a printing and publishing empire in Turkey and Cyprus.
All but Pounds 30m of the Pounds 371m has been traced but most appears to
have been frittered away. Realisations so far total just over Pounds 1m.
Little more is likely to be recovered.
The money-go-round began in a series of Polly Peck bank accounts in London,
loans to the company and letters of credit. The funds were recorded as
transactions in 'inter-company accounts' or loans from the parent PPI group.
Between September 1987 and October 1990, Pounds 245m was channelled into
northern Cyprus subsidiaries, mostly to Unipac, a packaging company. Another
Pounds 126m was booked to Turkish subsidiaries including Meyna, the fruit
business.
The money passed through several different bank accounts in the names of
these subsidiaries, including NatWest in Jersey, a correspondent account
with Midland bank in London on behalf of the Industrial Bank of Cyprus, and
Impexbank in Turkey.
A process of what experts call 'cloaking' then took place, with money
switched between accounts, apparently to confuse the trail.
Most funds were transferred into the Industrial Bank of Cyprus and
Impexbank, both of which were controlled by Mr Nadir during that period.
Only at this point was the money - which was still shown in the accounts as
borrowings to PPI subsidiaries - misappropriated into activities outside the
group such as purchasing PPI shares, propping up loss-making businesses, and
purchasing property and antiques.
These were never declared in the accounts.
It was also during 1987-90 that Mr Nadir made donations to the Conservative
party of at least half the Pounds 440,000 the Tories admit getting from the
businessman. Substantial contributions also went to charity.
A Citibank account in Switzerland in the name of his mother, Mrs Safiye
Nadir, emerges as a key conduit for the money. Some was passed on to Corvo,
the Jersey trust which funded South Audley Management, the London company
which managed some of Mr Nadir's personal interests. Some PPI money to buy
shares in the company was channelled through Restro, the Jersey trust.
Other money for share purchases went through secret trusts including
Riverbridge in Switzerland.
About Pounds 85m went to fund Mr Nadir's printing empire in Turkey,
including a number of loss-making newspapers he purchased in Turkey such as
Gunaydin. He also supported Noble Air, the company, now in liquidation,
controlled by his sister. Some Pounds 46m was transferred to the Central
Bank of Northern Cyprus.
But the bank has refused to co-operate and won on appeal a legal battle that
the English courts were not the appropriate jurisdiction in which it could
be pursued. Further money was transferred to about 20 offshore bank accounts
in the Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and elsewhere.
So far only a few millions have been traced. Some realisations will come
from sales of the remaining operating businesses, and the administrators
also plan to sue Stoy Hayward, PPI's auditor, in the next few months.
But creditors are likely to receive only 1p-2p in the pound.

FT  03 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Recs surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet another hefty hike in the dividend payout gave the regional electricity
companies a further excuse to move sharply forward. London unveiled a 16 per
cent dividend increase, putting it in second place behind Southern - which
posted a 17.6 per cent rise on Thursday - in the 'dividend race'.
A warning from one rec chairman that the high dividend payout will upset the
regulator went unheard in the market, as shares across the sector rose
strongly. London added 11 to 477p, Southern 15 to 497p and Yorkshire 11 to
531p.
There was some switching reported out of the water stocks, with Kleinwort
Benson said to be recommending the move, among which Yorkshire lost 8 to
482p and Anglian 12 to 467p.
British Aerospace followed the market lower, the shares giving up 8 to 392p,
in trade of 1.9m. Reasons for the decline included talk of technical
problems for the SA 80 gun it supplies to the British army.
Another story doing the rounds was that Lockheed of the US was to join the
BAe/Taiwan aerospace regional jets consortium agreed last year but still
seeking funding. However, such a move was dismissed by several analysts.
Profit downgradings from several brokers saw Glynwed International run back
5 to 294p. Bid speculation in engineering group James Wilkes continued and
drove the shares 6 forward to 88p.
Stake holder Suter, which firmed a penny to 164p, remains the favourite to
launch a bid with a price tag of 100p-a-share mentioned.
Shares in business services group Securiguard jumped 25 to 340p, with
turnover rising to 12m, after Rentokil Group launched a market raid early in
the session which increased its stake to 29.7 per cent. Rentokil announced
it was raising its offer to 345p per share from 270p, leaving one market
watcher to comment: 'It is all over for Securiguard bar the shouting.'
Securiguard later said it wanted to meet Rentokil to discuss recommending
the offer. The revised offer values Securiguard at Pounds 75.4m. Rentokil
edged a half-penny forward to 206 1/2 p, on volume of 3.6m.
The rise in the gold price and platinum's move to a four-year high boosted
Lonrho shares 3 to 123p. Strong two-way business in BET brought turnover to
9.1m by the close, with the shares remaining unchanged at 115 1/2 p. Hoare
Govett has warmed to the company and moved from being negative to calling it
a 'measured risk worth taking.'
Hotel group Forte continued its positive run, as talk in the market focused
once again on the meeting, rumoured to be 'imminent', between executives of
the group and Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund. He is said to be considering
making a substantial investment in Forte. The shares added 2 to 229p in good
turnover of 3.7m.
The oil majors remained under heavy selling pressure ahead of next week's
talks between Iraq and the United Nations which could result in the
resumptiom of Iraqi oil sales. Dealers also pointed to the recent strength
of sterling against the dollar, which has driven down the sterling price of
oil from Pounds 12 to Pounds 11.30 a barrel in the past two weeks. BP gave
up 9 1/2 to 296p, in heavy trade of 10m shares, while Shell Transport lost
15 to 612p, on volume of 7m.
Cautious comments from Goldman Sachs, the US securities house, on selected
chemicals stocks had a bad affect on BOC, which fell 18 to 667p.
Recent negative comment by SG Warburg continued to gnaw away at Coats
Viyella, which gave up 5 to 236p in a volume of 1.1m. Courtaulds, the stock
Warburg advised investors to switch into, edged up to 540p.
In banks, Abbey National edged forward a penny to 412p supported by a
recommendation from Kleinwort Benson.
Broadcasting stocks held firm against the market with Carlton Communications
adding 2 to 781p, Anglia moving up a penny to 343p and Scottish TV and
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees holding their price at 551p and 204p respectively.

FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Chrysler to sell its stake in
Mitsubishi Motors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer, will sell its 2.72 per cent stake in
Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, ending a 20-year capital link.
The timing of the sale, scheduled to take place during the week beginning
July 19, comes as the value on its holdings has risen due to the yen's sharp
appreciation against the dollar. Under current exchange rates, the stake is
worth some Dollars 164m.
Mitsubishi officials said the sale would not affect the industrial ties
between the two companies. However, it represents a change in the
relationship, which has created little synergy.
Ties between the companies have become strained as friction between US and
Japanese car makers has mounted due to Japan's increasing trade surplus.
Chrysler has been one of the most strident critics of Japanese policies.
Mitsubishi executives had been angered by Mr Lee Iacocca, former Chrysler
chairman, who had demanded limits on Japanese vehicle sales in the US.
Earlier this year, Japanese car makers raised prices in the US to avoid
protectionist pressure, after the big three US manufacturers - Ford, General
Motors and Chrysler - threatened to file an anti-dumping complaint against
Japanese makers.
Chrysler invested in Mitsubishi Motors in 1971, and the company was run for
15 years as a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In 1985, when
Mitsubishi Motors was listed, Chrysler had a 24 per cent stake, which was
reduced to 10.99 per cent in September 1989.
Although the crash on the Tokyo stock exchange in 1990 forced the US company
to halt its sell-off temporarily, last year resumed its stock sales.
In 1991 Chrysler sold to Mitsubishi its 50 per cent stake in Diamond Star
Motors, the companies' production joint venture in the US, raising Dollars
100m. The venture was formed in 1985, but Chrysler's investment could not
keep pace with Mitsubishi's ambitious expansion plans.
Last year, sales of Mitsubishi and Diamond Star cars by Chrysler totalled
128,764 units, down 20.5 per cent from 1989, while Mitsubishi's shipments of
its engines to Chrysler fell to 402,000 units, down 21.6 per cent.
Nikko Securities will lead the public subscription of the 23.25m shares.
Investor demand will be assessed from July 8 to July 14, with the sales
price likely to be determined on July 15.
Mitsubishi's share price yesterday fell 1.4 per cent to Y760 on the Tokyo
stock exchange due to jitters that Chrysler's sale would add negative
pressure to the share price.

sell-off

THE Australian government has been forced to redraw its privatisation
programme. The change will delay the flotation of Qantas, the Australian
airline, and see the flotation of a ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1bn) tranche
of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia by September or October this year.
Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, said the flotation of 75 per cent of
Qantas has been deferred to late 1994.
Mr Willis said the decision on Qantas followed advice from the government's
financial consultants and Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas chairman.
Late last year British Airways topped offers from several international
competitors and paid ADollars 665m for a 25 per cent stake in the air-line.
Qantas is also still digesting the acquisition of Australian Airlines, its
domestic carrier subsidiary, and is carrying a debt ratio in the order of
70:30.
To replace proceeds from the Qantas sale the government will offer a further
19 per cent stake in the Commonwealth Bank to the market in the current June
year, rather than next year as earlier planned.
The bank is already 30 per cent publicly owned following the ADollars 1.3bn
flotation in 1991 which effectively began the government's privatisation
programme.
Government policy limits private ownership of the bank to 49 per cent,
although the opposition favours a 100 per cent sale.
Analysts said the government was likely to move ahead with the float soon
after the bank announces its next annual results in September.
The bank's shares reacted positively to the news on Australian share markets
yesterday, reaching a record high of ADollars 8.76, valuing a 19 per cent
stake at about ADollars 1.45b.
Because of the size of the proposed flotation, analysts believe it is likely
to be broken into components, probably including an entitlement issue to
existing shareholders.
The changed timetable for the privatisations confirms recent speculation
that the Qantas flotation would be delayed, mainly because of the poor state
of the world airline industry.
The new privatisation timetable will increase the government's task in
reducing its growing budget deficit. Privatisations have begun to assume a
more important place in government budgeting, although the Labor Party still
favours a much slower pace than the opposition Liberal National coalition.
Other government-owned assets such as the Australian National Line, the
shipping company, and Australian Defence Industries, the defence contractor,
are also under consideration for sale.
Mr Willis said the Qantas postponement meant the budget deficit starting
point for 1993/94 would rise by between ADollars 500m and ADollars 750m.
He said the government had estimated that the Qantas float would contribute
about ADollars 2bn to receipts. The treasurer, Mr John Dawkins, has
previously indicated that without policy changes the starting point for the
budget deficit for 1993/94 would be about ADollars 18bn.

FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Moody's upgrades debt ratings of
two US banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investor Service has upgraded the debt ratings of Chemical Banking
and Chase Manhattan, two of the US's largest banks.
The ratings increase follows similar upgrades given by Standard &amp; Poor's,
and underlines recent improvements in the banks' earnings and capital
levels. The upgrades on senior and subordinated debt affect about Dollars
8bn of debt in each bank.
Moody's increased the long-term debt ratings of Chase Manhattan senior debt
to Baa1 from Baa2, and of Chemical Banking senior debt to Single A3 from
Baa1. Both banks have recently raised capital and improved the quality of
their loans in an effort to boost the ratings on their debt.
The rating agency said Chase's upgrade 'recognised the improvement in
Chase's capital measures following its recent Dollars 650m equity offering
as well as from future earnings retention'. But Moody's noted capital ratios
at Chase continued to be lower compared with other US banks, and that 'asset
quality was somewhat impaired'.
Chemical Banking was said to have benefited from its merger with
Manufacturers Hanover, and from 'substantial progress' in reducing its
portfolio of impaired loans. Underlying earnings had benefited from
non-interest income from Treasury and trading activities.

FT  03 JUL 93 / US ends opposition to Vietnam loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is to drop its opposition to a multilateral plan to clear Vietnam's
arrears to the International Monetary Fund, paving the way for the Hanoi
government's reinstatement in the international financial system, President
Bill Clinton said yesterday.
But Mr Clinton said progress so far on resolving questions about US
servicemen taken as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action during
the Vietnam war was 'simply not sufficient' to justify lifting the US trade
embargo.
Yesterday's announcement will allow a group of countries led by France to
move ahead with a plan to lend Vietnam the money it needs to pay off its
Dollars 140m (Pounds 93.3m) arrears to the IMF. This would in turn open the
way for Vietnam to negotiate more substantial balance of payments financing
from the IMF and project loans from the World Bank.
But it will aggravate the fears of US businesses that they will be left even
further behind as Vietnam's potentially dynamic economy is opened up to the
outside world. US companies may at present open offices in Vietnam and
negotiate contracts for future deals, but may not yet carry out these
contracts.
On Thursday, Mr Clinton met representatives of the families of servicemen
missing in action, who have strongly opposed normalisation of relations with
Vietnam, and promised that any further steps would 'strictly depend on
further progress by the Vietnamese on the POW/MIA issue'.
The POW/MIA lobby is a potent voice in US politics, and remains convinced
that Vietnam has not been honest in accounting for missing US soldiers and
airmen.
The president's own position on the issue is particularly delicate because
of his avoidance of military service in Vietnam. He accompanied his
announcement yesterday with statements of support from 18 members of
Congress who did serve in the war, including Senator John McCain of Arizona,
who was taken prisoner by the Vietnamese, and Senator John Kerry of
Massachusetts, who last year headed a Senate task force investigating the
fate of the POW/MIAs.
Mr Clinton said he would send a high-level mission to Hanoi to press for
further progress on accounting for the POW/MIAs.
The US has been working towards a more normal relationship with Vietnam
along the lines of a 'road map' sketched out by former president George
Bush, which linked economic and diplomatic concessions from the US to
progress towards peace and free elections in neighbouring Cambodia, on which
Vietnam has more than fulfilled its side of the bargain, and on the
POW/MIAs.
The administration must now convince the families of missing US servicemen
that they are likely to obtain more answers from Vietnam by making further
concessions than by maintaining an obdurate embargo.
The European Commission yesterday said it was ready to open negotiations on
a trade and co-operation pact with Vietnam, boosting the Hanoi regime's
campaign to end its commercial isolation.

THE GOVERNMENT is being urged by Welsh district councils to increase the

reorganisation, Roland Adburgham writes.
The Welsh Office has set out in a white paper its intention to have 21
authorities by April 1995, replacing the two-tier structure of eight county
and 37 district councils. The Council of Welsh Districts argues in its
interim response that the number should be increased to 27 to improve the

Battersea power station, with its inside gutted, stands forlorn awaiting the
next stage in its redevelopment.
The Hwang family, Hong Kong property developers, earlier this year acquired
an option to bid for the power station from banks which had previously
financed an ill-fated attempt by Mr John Broome, the property developer and
theme-park owner, to develop the 31-acre site.
The site on the Thames in London was collateral for a debt thought to total
more than Pounds 100m, including interest and penalty fees.
The deal has left the Hwang family studying options for acquiring the site
from its owner, Battersea Leisure, whose plans to transform the site ran
into financial difficulties.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is being urged by Welsh district councils to increase the
number of unitary authorities for Wales under its plans for local government
reorganisation.
The Welsh Office has set out in a white paper its intention to have 21 new
authorities in place by April 1995, replacing the current two-tier structure
of eight county and 37 district councils. But the Council of Welsh Districts
argues in its interim response to the white paper that the number should be
increased to 27 to improve the community basis of the new authorities.
In particular, the council points out that the single unitary authority
proposed for Powys would cover a quarter of the land mass of Wales and be
twice the area of any other authority.
Overall, the CWD supports the white paper. It believes a single tier of
authorities 'will dramatically increase the understanding of local
government'. It says there has been a full and open process of consultation
'which compares favourably with the parallel process of the Local Government
Commission in England'.
The CWD estimates that fewer than 1,000 council workers' posts will
disappear under the reorganisation, out of the 150,000 in Welsh local
government. It believes the transitional costs of the reform will be paid
back in less than five years.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Advocacy plan rejected: Talks deadlocked over proposed
limitation on many solicitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN two years after the government legislated to end the barristers'
200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts, talks about the terms on
which solicitors would gain wider advocacy rights remain deadlocked.
Yesterday the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee rejected the Law
Society's latest application for extended advocacy rights on the grounds
that additional safeguards are needed before solicitors employed in commerce
and industry, government and the Crown Prosecution Service can be allowed in
the higher courts.
The committee, chaired by Lord Griffiths, a law lord, has advised Lord
Mackay that there are no objections to solicitors in private practice being
allowed to appear in the higher courts.
But changes are needed to the 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act before
lawyers working for the CPS and the Government Legal Service are given wider
audience rights.
The committee said there needed to be a statutory limit on the amount of
advocacy work CPS lawyers were allowed to do in the Crown Court. The Law
Society's current application would allow the CPS and the GLS to do all
their higher court advocacy in-house. The committee said that was
unacceptable.
The rejection of the society's application represents another victory for
the barristers' lobby. Since the 1990 act came into force they have been
fighting a strong rearguard action to prevent both solicitors and barristers
in the CPS from having the right to conduct Crown Court trials.
The Bar fears that if the CPS is allowed to prosecute in the Crown Court it
will lose an important training ground for barristers, which could threaten
the viability of the independent Bar.
The Law Society said yesterday that a division between the rights of
employed solicitors and solicitors in private practice was unacceptable and
that it would urge the Lord Chancellor to accept its application in its
current form.
Mr Mark Sheldon, the society's president, said: 'This is a depressing day
for the profession and the public. Unrealistic concerns about the CPS are
evidently more important to the committee than wider client choice.'

FT  03 JUL 93 / MP's bill for right of appeal over bail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DECISIONS by magistrates to grant bail in spite of objections by the
prosecution will be subject to appeal under the terms of a private member's
bill approved by the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr David Maclean, home office minister, envisaged that new powers in the
bail amendment bill would be used in rare cases where there was a serious
public interest and good reason to suppose that the defendant would abscond.
MPs accepted amendments made by the House of Lords restricting the right to
appeal to the director of public prosecutions or other lawyers designated by
the home secretary.
Mr Maclean said 10 per cent of the 481,000 people granted bail in 1991
committed further offences before returning to the court.
There was a hard core of offenders, including burglars and car thieves, who
did not respect the courts and needed to be taught a lesson.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Ireland blocks EC aid package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 12 European Community member states were early this morning at odds over
how to divide up the Ecu157bn (Pounds 121bn) structural aid and regional
development budget for 1994-99, with Ireland blocking an outline agreement
broadly accepted by its partners.
As each country tried to secure more EC funds, the larger member states also
launched an assault on the European Commission's right to decide how money
for the Community's industrially stricken regions is to be allocated.
Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, which this week took over the
EC presidency, said that 'either we reach a timely decision, or we betray
our jobless and break the promises of Edinburgh', where EC heads of
government decided on the development package last December.
Ireland and the Netherlands threatened to veto any agreement on disbursing
the largest amount of development aid in EC history unless they received
guarantees on the share they want. At 3.30am, the Irish government decided
to block a deal because it had been offered IPounds 7.5bn, against the
IPounds 8bn prime minister Albert Reynolds insists he was promised at
Edinburgh.
Germany, Italy and the four poorest member states - Spain, Portugal, Greece
and Ireland - had earlier insisted that the eligibility threshold for
Objective 1, which includes the most deprived regions, be held at 75 per
cent of average per capita EC income.
These regions will get Ecu96.3bn, plus the Ecu15.5bn Cohesion Fund, which is
for the four poorest countries, on the most flexible terms reserved for the
Community's most backward areas.
The Commission wants Objective 1 status for Merseyside and the Scottish
Highlands and Islands, in the UK, Hainault in southern Belgium, and
Cantabria in northern Spain, even though they are above the 75 per cent
limit. Fierce negotiations early this morning looked certain to add to this
list. The French area of Valenciennes and Sambre-Avesnois adjoining Hainault
 -even though it is not a region - Argyll, Bute and West Moray in Scotland,
the Spanish Canary Islands and the Portugal and Madeira and the Azores are
the new beneficiaries.
This will almost certainly be approved, to preserve a 1988 political deal
making Northern Ireland and Corsica eligible for the most generous funding.
Since then, Corsica has effectively set a new eligibility benchmark, by
raising its per capita income to 79 per cent of the EC average. The areas
proposed by the Commission are just inside this.
Germany, France and the UK were seeking to deny the Commission the right to
decide on 'Objective 2' areas - those regions in industrial decline. In
addition, the UK was blocking Brussels' plans to spend part of the package's
money for training the unemployed or retraining workers who are in danger of
losing jobs because of industrial restructuring.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Rights for apes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS A book that I think you ought to read, called The Great Ape
Project: Equality beyond Humanity. It is an important book for there is a
chance that if enough of us read it, and do something about it, good will
come of it - perhaps so much good that we will be able to ameliorate the
predicament of our own species by helping others.
Our closest relatives are chimpanzees. To put it another way, says Jared
Diamond, professor of physiology at the University of California,
chimpanzees' closest relatives are not gorillas but humans. The genetic
difference - 1.6 per cent - separating us from pygmy or common chimps is
barely double that separating pygmy from common chimp and less, for example,
than between such hard-to-distinguish European bird species as willow
warblers and chiffchaffs (2.6 per cent).
Despite our genetic closeness to the other great apes, we treat them badly.
Hence this book, in which 34 writers - scientists, philosophers, a lawyer, a
psychologist - anticipate a new stage in human development: a reassessment
of the moral status of chimps, gorillas and orang-utans and the acceptance
of some non-human animals as persons.
The authors want a declaration on great apes that welcomes them into a
'community of equals' and gives them various rights, enforceable at law,
including the right to life, protection of liberty and the prohibition of
torture.
At present, says the declaration, only some humans are regarded as members
of this community. But there is now no remaining moral or ethical argument
against extending it. 'History shows us,' the declaration maintains, 'that
there has always been, within our own species, that saving factor: a squad
of determined people willing to overcome the selfishness of their own group
in order to advance another's cause.'
I was so uplifted by The Great Ape Project that I scuttled round to London
Zoo to talk to one of the chimps, funnily enough named Michael.
With a bit of luck, I said, you will be out of here quite soon. There is a
groundswell of opinion among intelligent humans that holds that our
treatment of the great apes is similar to the way in which normally
compassionate people once condoned human slavery.
Jane Goodall, an expert on chimps, says that evidence for sophisticated
mental performances by apes has become ever more convincing, I continued.
They can solve simple problems with reasoning and insight. Can plan for the
immediate future. Experiments have demonstrated their powers of
generalisation, abstraction and concept-forming. They can use abstract
symbols to communicate. And they have some kind of self-concept.
The thing is, Michael, that the line dividing man from beast, 'us' from
'them,' has become blurred and disreputable. We are all in this together. I
know we are shuttling to oblivion on a pint-sized planet. But there is still
time for humans to make amends - to acknowledge your rights and protect you
from harm.
Michael snorted. He said: What makes you think we want to have anything more
to do with you than the absolute minimum? Your species is a disgrace. You
are wrecking yourselves and the planet.
I said: I suppose you mean our wars and nuclear adventurism and population
growth? Or even the little things, our pornography and hard drugs? Our
amazingly short-fused tempers?
That is only the start of it, said Michael. Apart from your ugliness and
cruelty there is all the rest: John Major, John Smith, your silly political
squabbling, prices at Sainsbury's, music critics, News At Ten, your
obsession with stupid ball games, blithering Virginia Wade, Thames Water -
the depthless banality of so many of your enterprises.
I said: Give us a break, Michael. We are still a young species. The last
common female ancestor of all living humans probably lived 150,000 years
ago. We are only 5,000 human generations old. This may explain our
defensiveness: our insistence on 'them' and 'us.' And we are not all bad.
I don't want to hear about the Sistine Chapel, growled Michael.
I don't mean that, I said. I mean that in most places we have at least
stamped out slavery, the exhibiting of deformed humans in circuses and
public hangings. We are trying to improve ourselves.
Michael turned away in disgust. He said: Tell that to the giraffes. They are
suckers for happy endings.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Future belongs to astrologers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE UPON a time people read newspapers in order to read news. They wanted
to find out what had happened in the world the day before.
Now people read newspapers to find out what will happen tomorrow, and, in
particular, what will happen to them. The astrologer has become the most
successful writer in newspaper and magazine publishing, outstripping in both
pay and popularity even the most esteemed journalist.
Then there are those who tell readers not what will happen to them, but what
they should do, to make the right things happen. These are the agony aunts,
scarcely less popular than the astrologers, and scarcely less tendentious.
Perhaps the most famous is 'Dear Abby', syndicated worldwide to inform Asia
and Africa of what middle-aged female America thinks is the correct way to
eat at table. The great masses of these continents seem to take all this
very seriously: they have an inkling that the US is the world's dominant
culture, and therefore worth respect, if not imitation.
We, however, do not import the East's astrology and agony columns, which is
a great pity. They are far more entertaining than their western
counterparts. One of my favourites is Dr Paisarl, whose 'Thai astrology'
column appears just underneath 'Dear Abby' in the Bangkok Sunday Post. Dr
Paisarl is wonderfully clear in his answers to the most difficult questions,
in sharp contrast to the wishy-washy generalisations of his western rivals.
In a recent issue, one of his female correspondents (they usually are
female) wrote 'I wish for you to predict when I will meet my life partner
and have my own business. I was born in Bangkok on July 18th 1965, at 3.25
am.'
Dr Paisarl had all the facts at his fingertips. 'Dear Madam: Against all the
odds you cannot initiate any business of your own. It's only your wishful
thinking. However, you will regularly get a very high salary until your
retirement. Don't try to change it, except after you marry . . . Your life
partner will be a widower many years your senior. He will be a smart-looking
well-off man, who will always try to please you. He may have two children
from his previous marriage. You will have a chance to meet him this October
or by January at the latest. You will develop your super-romantic love very
fast and get married next year.'
To a correspondent, writing from India with the simple request: 'Could you
please tell me about my future in general?' Dr Paisarl responds: 'As for
your personal life, you will barely have the freedom to choose your own
spouse. You will get married with the one selected by your parents. You will
change your residence next year and rarely will you stay in your home town.
You can settle down between 1996 and 1997 but you are unlikely to have many
children.'
'Dear Abby' and the other US agony aunts seem on the face of it to come from
a much saner world. On the same day as the items I quote from Dr Paisarl
Dear Abby published a letter from 'Colorado mother', who wrote that:
'Yesterday my four year old daughter took a nasty spill and hit her face on
our coffee table. She now has a black eye and a terrible bruise. This
morning, out of fear of being accused of child abuse, I cancelled the time I
had reserved for her at the day care centre. I really had nothing to hide,
but these days all it takes is a whisper, a rumour and the child welfare
people will be calling on you and asking a lot of questions. It is getting
like the Salem witch hunts all over again.'
Dear Abby replied that 'Colorado mother' should have taken her child to
school, adding the rather sinister proviso 'if, as you explained, the child
fell . . . and you had nothing to hide.' I imagine that most western readers
would find Dear Abby reassuringly normal after the bleak lives and primitive
assurances of Doctor Paisarl. But it seems to me that the middle America
conjured up by Abby and her neurotic correspondents is a crazier place by
far. The East might still have arranged marriages, but it has avoided the
witch hunts of the West's social workers.

FT  03 JUL 93 / As they say in Europe: The soft soap of capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OTHER day I went to a fascinating meeting (sorry about the oxymoron)
which discussed the first half year of the 'Marshall Plan of the Mind.' The
MPM was the idea of my ex-boss, John Tusa, and has been partly supported by
an imaginative grant from the Foreign Office. It employs the talents of some
of my colleagues who try to spread information about the free market,
capitalism, business et al to Russia, warts and all.
Theyt make programmes in Russian for Radio Russia. These include How
Business Works, another In Business and a third is the Free Market Society.
The fourth is a radio soap opera, House No 7. The audiences run into
millions. House No 7 is a particular success but also produces cultural
clashes for there is no tradition of radio soap in Russia. There is no
tradition of discussing business problems: 'intellectuals' hate the very
word 'business'. There is no tradition that deals with worldly matters,
except socialist realism. Yet socialist realism had to be destroyed before
House No 7 could be constructed - heroic tractor drivers' platitudes and
stage villains are not the stuff of soap.
So getting nine Russian scriptwriters to make the residents of House No 7
talk about trade has been a problem. They work under the direction of a
young Englishwoman who once helped keep The Archers, Britain's most popular
radio soap, down on the farm handing out information about how to grow
things. The similarities between daily reality as portrayed in The Archers
and that of House No 7 are limited. A profile of one of the characters runs:
'Dima's latest idea is to sell gas-guns . . . Dima has heard that some of
the guns are defective and that users have been injured. He decides to
monitor carefully who he is selling to. Dima is offered a consignment of
ladies' underwear . . .'
Thus we are introduced to a character my colleagues in business journalism
would call a 'gas-gun-to-panties conglomerate'. Dima has been left facing
the choice of whether to move into narcotics. This illuminates a solution to
a basic problem that underlies the relationship between the British producer
and the Russian actors and writers. The Russians have mastered the
production requirements of radio soap, but they struggle to leave listeners
on the edge of their seats.
So not only has the producer to push her team into thinking about business,
she also has to demand, when listening to a story outline, 'A potom?' ('And
then?'). It is here one sees the clash of the pre-capitalist East and the
post-modern West in microcosm.
The problem is A potom?, what will happen next, but it is an Anglo-Saxon
problem. In Russia everybody knows what will happen next. Disaster will
strike. Oblomov will go back to sleep, Raskolnikov back to prison. And,
where themes might peripherally concern business problems, they merely
highlight the inevitable doom; the cherry orchard will not be cut down by
its owners, the Ranyevsky family will be evicted as a result. The tension
that exists in Russian culture focuses on when, not if, the hero-as-victim
is next going to get it in the neck. This partly reflects the language - the
construction of Russian verbs concentrates on the when and the how, rather
than the what, of actions and events.
When I returned to my office after the meeting I switched on the little
television by the desk, zapped to the Russian first channel and there was an
episode of the fabulously popular Mexican soap, The Rich Also Weep. One
could see why the Russians like it: there were a lot of rich people getting
it in the neck as their individual personalities led them to their
preordained rendezvous with destiny. (Latin Americans and Russians have more
in common than one might think.) The evocation of wealth was enchanting:
huge chandeliers in dining rooms built to small studio scale, copious
supplies of colourful tableware, deep nylon-tufted carpets, pink front doors
and Louis XV telephones.
House No 7 has been able to popularise the daunting reality of Russian
everyday life without succumbing to the traditional sense of the futile. A
virtue of all these programmes is that they provide a comprehensive manual
of contemporary Russian life. As the British presenter of How Business Works
remarks of the crazy diversification programme developed by one
entrepreneur, 'Mr Aleshkin laughed in agreement when I said this was
economic madness.' Chekhov is still writing the scripts.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Private View: Sprightly oracle of a decadent century -
Bengali writer Nirad Chaudhuri looks back on 95 years of a full and
controversial life and explains why he thinks the West is going rotten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS 96th year Nirad Chaudhuri, the Bengali writer, burns with astonishing
vitality. His memory is elephantine, his knowledge encyclopaedic. He is too
poetic for a pedant, too passionate for a philosopher, too scholarly for a
journalist, and too playful for his adopted role as the Cassandra of his
century.
Within seconds of my arrival he was giving a virtuoso performance which he
conducted with elegant hands. He talked nineteen to the dozen, shuffling to
the bookshelf to show off a prized volume or quotation, denouncing the new
English Bible ('you cannot keep Christianity by making your religious
literature accessible to shopgirls') and reciting the Lord's Prayer in Greek
and Latin.
Having come to quiz him about old age, I was disconcerted by this impish
figure dressed like a perfect English gentleman and as proudly as a bantam
cockerel. Eventually I asked if there were pleasures in being 95, or only
disadvantages.
'It depends absolutely on the individual,' he said. 'I don't get on with
elderly people at all because they consider me mad. I consider them dead.'
He cackled.
Chaudhuri was a premature baby and 'always scraggy'. He is 5ft tall and
weighs six stone. Until late middle age his health was poor (for which he
blames his failure to get his MA after a First in history at Calcutta).
'For myself I took special care that I should remain a live person. So for
the last 50 years I have not taken any Indian food. And you don't know how I
despise and hate vegetarianism. I don't eat much bread or anything else,
only meat, vegetables, milk products and fruit.
'I have lived because lowly things have a longer life than higher ones: for
instance, weeds, mice, snails survive where human beings may not. I am, from
the purely zoological point of view, no better probably than a snail.
'But what I felt is that whoever has kept me like this - I don't believe in
the ordinary kind of religion: it may be the universe, it may be the cosmos
 -he has spared me my mind. I say the day I shall lose my mental efficiency,
let me die.
Chaudhuri claims to have written his two volumes of autobiography from
memory. 'Memory comes from interest in life,' he declared, rattling off the
names of the geological ages by way of demonstration. He got to his feet
and, stiff and straight as a schoolboy, recited a Bengali poem he had
learned in 1920 and some verses of Ronsard, the 16th century French poet.
He had never revised his writings, never had to change his mind about the
decadence of his century - though he admitted being temporarily deflected by
England's post-war optimism. 'My mind doesn't change,' he said, 'because my
mind is really a camera. I take credit only for developing the negative.'
Don't you think the world looks a quite different place to the young and to
the old?
'Certainly. But I have never lost the sensibility to the world which I had
at 16. And I remain that idiot. I could not be a greater fool. That is to
say, I am in layers. I am not one personality. The wretched people' (he did
not specify which wretches) 'they are so very monolithic: they don't
understand that I am layers of sedimentary rocks.'
At the age of 29 he was struck dumb by a girl he saw in Benares. 'After the
train left Benares station, I felt something had snapped here.' He touched
his breast pocket. 'I lay down on the bed and cried for three hours for that
girl,' he continued, shrieking with laughter. 'A man who can be such an
idiot at 29 will retain his idiocy all his life]'
Socrates said that one advantage of age is that sexual desire goes. Is that
true?
'I don't know about women. But at no time in his life does man lose sexual
desire. The only question is at what level he retains it. This is the
horrible tragedy of age.' Sex was not love but could never be banished,
'just as alcohol remains in the best chateau-bottled wine.'
In view of his own vitality I asked him if he was only professionally a
pessimist.
'No, I am not professionally pessimistic, I am professionally realistic. As
a student of history I cannot deceive myself as to the symptoms I see. That
does not mean I have despaired of mankind for ever. My difficulty today is
that while if I had lived at the end of the Roman Empire I should have
easily pointed out where the new life was coming from - Christianity and the
new Germanic blood - today I cannot. Because what I call the new country,
America, is even more decadent, more rotten - from the human point of view,
not technologically - than the old.'
Every old man, I ventured, says things have been going downhill since his
youth. What makes this century - your century - special?
'This is nothing to do with the natural change of opinion in elderly people.
On the contrary. I may be disenchanted with the present state of the world
but of mankind I have not despaired.'
Chaudhuri grew up in Kishorganj, now in Bangladesh, hating the British rule
like his fellows but, he says, compelled eventually to recognise its
cultural superiority. He dedicated his first book, Autobiography of an
Unknown Indian, a beautifully-written compound of lyrical descriptiveness
and historical analysis, 'to the memory of the British Empire in India.'
He lived in Calcutta until 1942, then Delhi, and settled in England at the
age of 73 to ruminate on the decadence of both India and its imperial
masters and what he calls the disaster of Indian independence. The result
was the quasi-autobiographical Thy Hand, Great Anarch], completed in his
90th year.
'I am a dedicated imperialist', he explained. 'I did not get my idea of
imperialism from that exploded intellectual creature of hatred, Karl Marx. I
got it from the Roman Empire.'
Chaudhuri's theme is the cycle of civilisations in which mankind ascends to
the divine or sinks lower than the beasts. I remarked that Tolstoy had found
intellectual comfort in the simple faith of peasants. Chaudhuri snorted.
'They don't understand. They are like animals. I have never been an
egalitarian. I believe mankind will become so different in 1000 or 500 years
that he will not be recognisable as the same animal.
'Zoological speciation may have ceased but mental speciation will continue.
Why is it that when Bengalis come I understand them but they don't
understand me? They are on a lower plane as a mental species. I admit an
affinity with the dog. I admit an affinity even with a bird or an earthworm.
So we never have the right to look down on anybody who is not grown to our
point. But I have evolved mentally where others may not have evolved.'
Foreign aid was a waste of time, he said. He told a former British High
Commissioner that no amount of money could turn chimpanzees into English
gentlemen. 'All collateral lines are dead lines while the European tip
remains living. But it is causing me real pain that what I call the living
tip seems to be withering.'
What is the evidence for that?
'Simply, even the conception of physical love has disappeared. Taste in food
has disappeared.'
You mean sexual behaviour is immoral?
'I don't mean moral or immoral. I say it's become crude. Empire is gone,
economic spirit is gone, industrial superiority is gone. Can these disappear
without mental decadence? There is nothing wrong.'
Nothing wrong with decadence?
'Nothing wrong. It's ageing. Now look here. This is fundamental to my
thinking. Just as a man grows up, reaches the full majority of his power,
then ages, so do nations. If you do not accept that then we shall never
agree.'
With that the old man whipped out his false teeth and held them grinning up
to my face. 'There's nothing to be ashamed of, nothing discreditable,' he
mumbled. He replaced the denture. 'It is the law of nature. Nobody can
escape it. But there is a difference, as the Romans said, between perishing
in your house full of years and honours and perishing of syphilis in a
brothel.' He repeated the last phrase with relish.
I asked for other symptoms of Western decadence. 'Physical energy has gone
and the vitality which expresses itself in joie de vivre. Pleasure is not
happiness.'
What about art?
'Art is non-existent.'
Music?
'Creation is non-existent, enjoyment remains. I formerly never fell below
Schubert. Now I have come down even to Elgar. But in painting I don't
acknowledge anybody to be a painter after Cezanne. Architecture disappeared.
Artistic life is no longer: it's all fraud.'
The obvious riposte, I said, is that you are an old man who won't accept
modern aesthetic values.
Chaudhuri was angry. 'This is absurd. Look here. I am the only man in India
who has great monographs on palaeolithic painting. From that to Chinese,
Japanese, Indian, Persian, European, all I can admire. You cannot say I am
narrow. It is nothing to do with my age. This silly thing is always said
about me - the idiots. If I can admire, for instance, Indian music and
European music both, if I can admire palaeolithic painting to Cezanne, can
you tell me that I am narrow?
No.
'Then that is it.'
I asked him if his unpopularity in India upset him; he countered by saying
he was the highest-paid contributor to the Bengali press. But perhaps they
like hearing the worst of themselves? 'No, Indians don't like it. What they
did like was being criticised by white men. That nurses their grievance.
Indians have two great passions: one is making money, the other is nursing a
grievance.' He chortled.
'Now, in India they can do neither so they come to England' (he was hardly
able to speak for laughing now) 'and complain they are being ill-treated.
Not one son-of-a-bitch will go back. I have not met a single Indian in
England in this 23 years who has not said 'we hate the English, they
ill-treat us.' If I had felt that for even 10 hours I would have taken the
aeroplane. Do you think I would submit to this insult?
'Their greed for money is because they have accepted defeat in life, and all
people who accept defeat in life want to nurse a grievance. The elixir of
success passes away but grievance, never]'
What do you think of your own future?
'I may not arise from the bed tomorrow morning. Listen. From the age of 16
to about my 50th year there was not one evening I went to bed without
thinking of death. Now I have come to terms with death. I have lost all fear
of it.'
The annihilation of death was horrible, tragic, he said, but had to be
accepted. 'If at my age a fellow is not prepared to die next moment, he's a
damned fool.' He quoted Marcus Aurelius: 'Mortal man, you have been a
citizen of a great city and you are going to leave it. Don't complain.'
'I am going, but . . . ' He broke off and rummaged in a tray of odds and
ends. When he turned round he was holding a small battery. 'I consider
myself a little bit of electricity packed in a dry cell. And when the
universe has done with me, I am thrown, like this . . . ' and he threw the
battery into the fireplace.
You have used your life to the full, I said. What was its purpose?
'My purpose is, first of all, to find what human value my country and
civilisation has created which will remain valuable for all mankind. But
also to find what mankind has done to make human life a great thing. Had I
been a poet I should have brought something new. But what I can bring is an
interpretation which would give faith.'
But if we are coming to the end, like ancient Rome, not even your analysis
is going to save us.
'Plato wanted to prevent the decadence of Athens, but that does not mean
Plato has not been useful for later generations. What I say is this. If
there remains any interest in India, any knowledge of the English language,
I will live. If there remains any interest in mankind, my books will be
read. Though they interpret the value of human life in terms of India that
does not mean they lack some universal application. I shall form part of the
mental life of future generations.'
As I rose to leave, Chaudhuri barred the doorway. 'You can choose to be
ordinary,' he said. 'You see here an extraordinary man.'
I had to agree.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Don Juan opens Avignon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 47th Avignon Festival opens on Friday with a performance of Moliere's
Don Juan in the Cours d'Honneur of the Papal Palace, a co-production with
the Comedie-Francaise to be directed by Jacques Lassalle.
This represents a welcome return by the Festival to square one. Don Juan was
the piece most frequently given at Avignon by the Theatre National Populaire
when the Festival began after the war under Jean Vilar. Before the Festival
expanded to unmanageable proportions, Don Juan was performed 233 times. When
asked why he played it so frequently, Vilar replied that of all Moliere's
plays this one was 'the most contemporary, the closest to our attitudes, our
anxieties, our beliefs, our outlook. Don Juan is a modern hero . . .'
And that, we are told, is exactly the note that will be struck in this new
production. Contemporaneity, says Bernard Faivre d'Arcier, will be the
keynote of this year's Festival programme as a whole. It runs from July 9 to
August 2 and the majority of the plays will be works of the 20th century;
with an underlying Slavic flavour. They include Mikhail Bulgakov's Adam and
Eve, written for but never performed by the Moscow Arts Theatre, Chveiak au
Terminus du Monde, derived by Wladyslaw Znorko as a new ending to the career
of The Good Soldier Schweik, La Poule d'Eau by Stanislaw Witiewicz, Pan
Theodor Mundstock adapted by Bruno Boeglin from the novel of Ladislav Fuks
set in Prague in 1941.
Britain is another region well represented in this year's international mix
at Avignon with Edward Bond's Maison d'Arret, and Steven Berkoff's Kvetch
given in French translation both directed by Jorge Lavelli, and Stoppard's
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead performed in Russian by an Israeli
company.
The French novelist and poet Louis-Rene des Forets will be honoured with
readings from his work and a performance of a play made from his novel Le
Bavard. Philippe Caubere will be presenting his Le Roman d'un Acteur
described as 'a burlesque epic in 11 episodes'. Each one occupies a whole
evening; this virtuosic piece relies heavily on improvisation as the hero
tries to make a work of art out of his life. If this sounds like a touch of
the Pirandellos there will be more of the same in a production of Six
Personnages en Quete de . . . by Sophie Loucachevsky who has also devised an
evening devoted to the tales of Pushkin, while L'Homme, la Bete et la Vertu
is a less well known work of Pirandello's that will be performed. His
leading French interpreter in the 1920s, the actor-director Georges Pitoeff,
is the subject of this year's major exhibition.
From the same innovative period in the French theatre, the surrealist
playwright, Roger Vitrac is also represented with Les Mystere de l'Amour in
a production from Rheims. A prestigious African company, the Ensemble Koteba
from Abidjan will be seen in Leconte de Lisle's translation of Oedipus at
Colonus with music by Olivier Dejours interpreted by Ethiopian musicians and
in Souleyman Koly and William Sassine's Funerailles Tropicales.
This year Festival is contained within the ancient city - nothing out at
Boulbon or Les Taillades - but the small festival of sacred music at
Villeneuve-lez-Avignon with performances in both the Chartreuse and the
Church of the Chartreuse will include recitals of work by Harrison
Birtwistle, Gerard Grisey and Klaus Huber.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: London picks up the Verdi torch - William Weaver
welcomes Covent Garden's plans to present all 28 Verdi operas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE confirmed Verdian, of course, especially if he has reached a certain
age, already knows the entire canon: one way or another, the 28 operas have
been recorded, either by big companies or by pirates. And, over recent
decades, all have been performed: Alzira in Rome, Oberto in Bologna, the
first version of Macbeth in Danville, Kentucky and other rarities at St.
Pancras or in Parma. Many of these productions were pilgrimage events; and
often they were, for opera-goers, genuine revelations. Some - like I due
Foscari - proved, truly, to be neglected masterpieces; but even the most
problematical, the admittedly uneven works came back to vivid life,
illuminating some obscure corner of Verdi's career and - as always in the
case of this composer - providing an evening of dramatic, musical
excitement.
Now, somewhat surprisingly, London will become the Verdi shrine, the Mecca
for those operatic pilgrims. An idea, conceived a couple of years ago by the
Royal Opera's associate music director Sir Edward Downes and the then opera
director of the house Paul Findlay, has been developed into a grand-scale
plan: a Verdi Festival, formally announced at a press conference last week
by Jeremy Isaacs, General Director of the ROH and his opera director
designate Nicholas Payne. Briefly, the idea is this: to present all 28 Verdi
operas, never less than four a year, between the summer of 1995 and the
summer of 2001, the year that marks the centenary of the composer's death.
Not all the productions will be new, and not all will originate at Covent
Garden. The first year's programme is typical: the festival will open with a
revival of the Stiffelio production introduced this year; the second
offering will be a co-production with Scottish Opera of I due Foscari, which
will be given first in Scotland; then there will be La traviata in a new
staging planned for November 1994, to be conducted (for the first time) by
Sir George Solti; and - another revival, Simon Boccanegra, conducted by
Bernard Haitink.
But this is not the whole story, for the Festival will include a number of
complementary events; and in this inaugural season the directors have
scheduled, at the South Bank Centre, two concert performances of Aroldo
(Verdi's later reworking of Stiffelio) and two also of the first, 1857
version of Boccanegra, affording an exciting confrontation with the familiar
1881 version that will be given in the opera house. An international
committee of more than a dozen Verdi experts, including Julian Budden,
Andrew Porter, Charles Osborne and myself, meeting in London last week for
the third time, discussed other supporting projects: publications, study
days, exhibits, staged readings of some of the works that inspired the
operas (like Byron's closet drama The Two Foscari), performances of
significant non-operatic works, notably the composite Requiem for Rossini
which Verdi proposed and to which he contributed (it has never been heard
live in Britain).
Verdi's three Parisian operas - Jerusalem (a drastic 1847 reworking of the
earlier I lombardi of 1843) - will be given in successive years, in French,
mounted by the Theatre Chatelet, Paris; in each case, the festival hopes to
include the rarely-performed ballet music. Other Verdi ballet music (for the
French version of Il trovatore, for example) will probably be heard in
concert performance. Nicholas Kenyon and Clive Bennett of the BBC have
assured support.
Nicholas Payne confessed relief at the favourable reactions to last week
announcement, having feared that critics of the Royal Opera House might
seize this opportunity to accuse the management of delusions of grandeur
and, worse, delusions of wealth. Actually, along with the artistic planning,
the theatre's staff has been thoroughly exploring matters of sponsorship and
marketing. Verdi, of course, sells well; and even the less familiar operas
will be presented with star singers (Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo will
alternate in Stiffelio; the much-praised young tenor Roberto Alagna will
repeat here the Alfredo that won him cheers in La Scala's Traviata,
Catherine Malfitano, June Anderson, and Carol Vaness are already signed up
for the first year.
For years Verdians have lamented the fact that in all the world there is no
festival uniquely devoted to their composer; in Italy, the authorities of
Parma, capital of Verdi's native region, have long been discussing - and
quarreling about - the establishment of a 'Verdi Bayreuth' in their city.
Projects have been announced, initiated, aborted, abandoned. And, though
Parma is one of Italy's richest and most cultivated cities, funds and
imagination have always been lacking. Now London has boldly picked up the
torch and is running with it. In two years' time, the capital can expect, no
doubt, an unusually large influx of Italian summer visitors; many of them
will speak with a Parma accent. As Verdi did.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Poetry in Performance

<TEXT>
AS IF to give geographical proof that the strengths of contemporary poetry
do not necessarily emanate from the metropolitan centre, Bloodaxe Books have
been launching The New Poetry, their anthology of the best of British and
Irish verse of the past 15 years, in Glasgow, Newcastle, London and, this
week, at Waterstone's, Leeds.
Fittingly, this week's readers were some of the Yorkshire poets who are
represented in the book: Simon Armitage (Huddersfield), Geoff Hattersley
(Wombwell), Ian McMillan (Barnsley), Maggie Hannan (Hull) and Ian Duhig
(Leeds). David Morley (Sheffield), one of the book's triumvirate of editors,
gave an account of its raison d'etre.
The title of the book itself has been borrowed from Al Alvarez's anthology
of the same name that was published in the early 1960s and helped to shape
the perceptions of a whole generation of poetry readers.
Anthologies can be immensely influential in that way - they are bought in
their thousands by schools, and by those who, though interested in poetry,
may be disinclined to buy collections by individual poets. An anthology can
provide an aerial view of the principal features of the terrain almost at a
glance.
The Bloodaxe anthology, unlike some others, impresses by its inclusiveness
and its catholicity - 55 poets in a volume of 350 pages, selected by the
editors from a long shortlist of 250 possible candidates.
The message of the book, presented in what must be one of the most
ineptly-written and poorly-argued introductions for many a year (readers are
recommended to skip it altogether; the poets themselves are a much more
lively bunch) is that the idea of mainstream is no longer tenable in a
country as linguistically fissiparous as Britain is today. It is not a
question of English poetry any longer but of British poetries.
Earlier anthologists, by arguing that particular groups of poets represented
a dominant trend, were guilty of marginalising all the rest. And so here
they all are at last, a gloriously democratic rainbow coalition of jangling
voices: young Lallans poets from north of the border, Afro-Caribbean poets
from Birmingham and Glasgow, all proclaiming the triumph of cultural
diversity, and helping to eradicate once and for all that notoriously
exclusive Oxbridge bias . . . And, equally important, helping us to
recognise quite how unstable language is these days; how rapidly it is
changing from moment to moment, and how difficult it is therefore even to
talk about a common language for poetry any more.
And is there a single figure who has helped to bring about the generational
shift of the past 15 years? Who has helped to shape and define poetry's
response to the world of today? Yes, argued David Morley this week. 'It is
Mrs Thatcher who changed the subject matter and the language of poetry,' he
told us.
But how? By creating a strong resistance within poets themselves, those
antennae of the race, to the duplicities of governments, the lies of
official language, the rubbishing of society etc, and thereby helping them
to define poetry's new freedoms from such repression. 'We inhabit a society
where government can close down pits, and then not close down pits, and then
close them down anyway. The world, like language itself, is full of
dissociations. . . '
In spite of the fact that it might equally well be argued that rulers have
been lying to their subjects since the dawn of Man, the poets from Yorkshire
who read from their own anthologised selections did indeed seem to confirm
in part the general drift of Morley's audaciously simplistic argument, and
none than Ian McMillan from Barnsley, whose sense of the bizarre and the
ridiculous coupled with a punchy, flat-cap delivery worthy of the
street-corner news vendor, made for a wonderful ten minutes of non-stop
entertainment.
'Sometimes my poems are set in the real Barnsley,' he began, 'and other
times in a Barnsley of the mind - but maybe they're the same thing.' And so
they were. Or, at least, so they seemed to be. 'I always wanted Barnsley to
be near the sea,' he said of his second poem, 'The Er Barnsley Seascapes',
'and it can happen - in a poem . . .'
He paused. 'And there were, er, something else as well,' he said. 'The word
'er' never gets into, er, poetry, but people are saying it all the time - so
I thought I'd, er, get it in.' And so it got in - and unlucky, landlocked
Barnsley, flying on the wings of McMillan's anarchic humour, got to the sea.
And that is perhaps one way in which the new poetry is trying to define its
new freedoms. Ian Duhig, another reader, put it slightly differently:
'Poetry allows you to do what you like. Of a novel, you can say: life's not
like that. Well, I am. . .'
But does not the New Poetry, by these lights, sound a bit like the Old Dada
writ large? Baroness Thatcher seems to have made the world such a confusing
place to live and write in.
The New Poetry edited by Michael Hulse, David Kennedy, and David Morley. 352

FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Souvenirs of the Grand Tour - Patricia Morison reviews
an exhibition of Mengs' work for his British patrons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE MUST have been wonderful for the young 18th-century English nobleman on
his Grand Tour. All the pleasures of Italy, sensual, artistic, social and
intellectual, were his for the taking. These were wonderful, unrepeatable
years and so, looking for a permanent reminder, the rich milord sat for his
portrait.  If in Rome his choice lay between two enormously famous artists.
Was it to be Pompeo Batoni at the Via Boca di Leone, or his deadly rival at
the foot of the Spanish Steps, Anton Raphael Mengs?
Anton Raphael Mengs and his British Patrons at Kenwood House is a follow-up
to the Batoni exhibition of a decade ago. And yet, whether it can rescue
Mengs's reputation as Batoni's has been, I rather doubt. Batoni was a
theatrical painter, whose sitters are stylish creatures who dispose
themselves elegantly against a background of the sacred ruins of Rome.
Mengs was ever the phlegmatic German. He appealed to rather solemn,
intellectual patrons who were undeterred by the German's farouche manners -
he insisted on singing and whistling as he painted Pope Clement XIII. Like
many an ambitious artist of the day (Ramsay, Piranesi, Robert Adam,
Reynolds, to name but a few), he published a treatise on how modern art was
to save itself. He was diligent in his study of antique art, partly because
this was what his patrons expected. Above all, however, he doggedly emulated
those artists he admired; Correggio, Guido Reni, Van Dyck, and of course,
his namesake, Raphael.
Mengs was an infant prodigy, pushed by his father who was court painter at
Dresden. This exhibition is too incomplete to give a full account of his
work, since several of the most important paintings in British collections
are too large or fragile to travel. Moreover, Mengs's huge reputation in the
eyes of fellow artists was due above all to the frescoes he painted in Rome
and as court painter in Madrid. Even so, there is quite enough in the
exhibition to show that here was an artist whose talent was stifled by his
own fascination with his great models.
There was calculation as well as conviction in the models Mengs chose. The
dealer and fellow-artist Thomas Jenkins advised him that few English lords
and ladies could resist the chance to dress in Van Dyck costumes, such as we
see in portraits of the Marquess of Londonderry and Lord Brudenell. An
attractive half-length portrait of the latter in Van Dyck lace colour and
wrap-around cloak may be by Mengs, or it could be a rare work by Jenkins
himself.
It makes an interesting contrast with the grandest portrait in the
exhibition, also of Brudenell, whose Grand Tour lasted over a decade. The
nobleman is seated in his study, beneath a bust of Cicero, open book in his
hand, every inch the student. And yet, the dog at his side and the glimpse
of parkland beyond hints at the pleasures available to the man of property.
For once, Mengs attempted something truly original in his portrait of
another lord steeped in his love of antiquity, in this case, of
architecture. From Prague comes the 'Allegorical Portrait of Lord
Charlemont', a painting of 1755 which is definitely comical (Charlemont has
a huge chin and Pinnociesque nose) but well shows Mengs as the forerunner of
neo-Classicism. The bare-breasted figure of Architecture is gesturing to the
amateur architect that he must imitate Palladio, whose bust looms above him.
And yet, inevitably, he must lean on the achievements of Vitruvius, on whose
sarcophagus he has rested his sketch-pad.
Confrontations between two figures were a favourite compositional device of
Mengs'. Had his 'Noli Me Tangere' from Oxford been available for the
exhibition, this point would have been still better made. As it is, visitors
must make do with a head of Christ, which like the 'Penitent Magdalene' and
'St John the Baptist' shows Mengs was well able to churn out heavily
sentimentalised devotional images.
However, when one looks at his dreary 'Lamentation' from St John's College
Cambridge, and his 'Holy Families', it becomes clear that grouping people
was the German artist's weakest point. However intensely he looked back to
Raphael, the effect was woefully clumsy.
And yet, precisely because Mengs's faults are so evident, this is an
exhibition which makes us aware of the effects for which 18th-century
artists and patrons strove - to cite the present in relationship to the
giants of the past. Kenwood House, where the permanent collection of the
Iveagh Bequest is full of souvenirs of the Grand Tour, is an excellent venue
to explore more fully the full range of art which the English went abroad to
find.
Until September 11 at Kenwood House, Hampstead Lane, NW3. 081-348-1286

FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Fellini on films - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE end of the screening of Fellini's Intervista at Cannes six years ago,
the audience all but levitated in rapture. After that split-second silence
that follows the viewing of a masterpiece, the cheers rang out so loud that
the absent Signor F could have heard them in Rome. His film about
film-making - a 50th birthday tribute to Cinecitta Studios starring all the
old Fellini hands (Mastroianni, Ekberg, himself) plus helpings of comedy,
fantasy and satire - would surely hasten straight from the Cote d'Azur to UK
cinemas?
It never came to Britain at all. The old maestro or his producers asked for
too much money, and the initially frantic bidders fell away as the years
passed. Now Intervista (Western Connection) appears on cassette, the year's
most distinguished video premiere and the best late Fellini after Ginger And
Fred.
As there, Marcello Mastroianni is our radiantly rueful hero. First seen in
blue topper and tails rising on a smoke-swathed movie crane outside
Fellini's studio office window, he later escorts us on the film's surreal
sorties beyond the Cinecitta gates: a trip to Anita Ekberg's villa plus
nostalgic home screening of La Dolce Vita - watch for the marvellous comic
punctation of a shot of three dogs - and a tram journey through Rome's
outskirts on a road terrorised by Red Indians, bordered by waterfalls and
thronged with old-world peasants selling grapes. What price theme parks when
you have Federico Fellini's runaway imagination?
Realism is an early casualty in this film. But what would you expect from a
director whose theme is the punchdrunk poetry of the picture business; and
whose portrait of Cinecitta itself is a delicious chaos of giant elephants,
cut-out Rolls Royce cars, lipstick-shaped cannons and passionate love scenes
cut short by the cry of 'Stop] Lunch]'
Video distributors are pulling a mean trick this summer. While Britain's big
screens groan under the weight of silly-season dross, with only Jurassic
Park promising glitter if not gold, the nation's VCRs are being wooed with
major treasures ancient and modern.
Tartan Video, the latest art-movie entrant, offers Fritz Lang's haunting
silent classic Dr Mabuse, The Gambler, Gillo Pontecorvo's searing docudrama
The Battle Of Algiers and Bergman's mid-period masterpiece Through A Glass
Darkly. Curzon bring you Nikita Mikalkov's Venice Golden Lion-winning Urga,
that spry East-meets-West pastoral set in Mongolia. And other July gems
include a Carl Dreyer (Vampyr, Redemption Video), a Zhang Yimou (Ju Dou, ICA
Projects) and a brace of Billy Wilders (The Apartment, Warner, and The
Fortune Cookie, MGM/UA).
Among more recent commercial movies transferred to video, there are also
riches aplenty. Pick of the month are Woody Allen's Husbands And Wives (20:
20), Roman Polanski's Bitter Moon (Columbia TriStar) and Brian DePalma's
Raising Cain (CIC), followed by Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon chewing up the
scenery in the film of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (20: 20).
Indeed scenery-consumption is a feature in all four films. Allen's picture
of a dissolving romance - himself and Mia Farrow as the spitting, hating
couple - turns life into art with a scarifying comic passion. Polanski's
shipboard black comedy lets Peter Coyote loose as a sort of randy Ancient
Mariner, bombarding a prim English couple with his (startlingly explicit)
sexual history. And star John Lithgow has a high time as a multiple-identity
psychopath in DePalma's glossy, tongue-in-cheek murder thriller: the tongue
not so far in cheek that it cannot shoot forth snake-like at surprise
moments to shock us.
Finally, and strictly for curio collectors, there is JFK: The Director's Cut
(Warner). This adds 17 extra minutes to Oliver Stone's already gargantuan
three-hour Kennedy epic and I am dashed if I can tell what difference they
make to the thesis or the dramatic effect, except to make a long film seem
even longer. When will the 'director's cut' actually mean a cut?

GLASTONBURY demands a strong constitution. Three days at the Festival and
the holes in the ground and claustrophobic cubicles that pass as toilet
facilities are filling fast. Then there is the litter: by Saturday you have
to breast-stroke though the rubbish on the 400-acre site. You can never win
with the weather, either. Ten minutes of rain and the place turns into a
swamp. If it is sunny, 15-mile queues form at standpipes and you can hear
the flesh sizzling - as you could this year.
And when it is all over, and you are sitting in your vehicle for an hour
waiting to get out of the car park, wondering if any household solvent will
get the grunge off your body, your last thought is that you will never go
back. But summer passes, autumn turns to winter, and you find yourself
asking when the festival is on again.
For Glastonbury is not just a rock or pop festival. It is not populated
solely by unemployed teenagers, drug addicts, hippies, 'New Age' travellers
or students. Parents with babies and small children were much in abundance
this year. There were plenty of oldies - by any criterion - too.
If you want to come and just listen to pop bands playing on the main stage -
modelled on Cairo's Great Pyramid of Cheops - then that is one option. But
hundreds, indeed thousands, of other attractions compete. There are jazz,
acoustic and world music stages. There is a circus field. Outdoor and indoor
cinemas play the latest releases. A theatre field has a crop of stand-up
comics, puppet shows and mime artists. There are the 'Green' fields as a
focus for healing, tranquility and the mystical fringes of life. And then
there are stalls selling hamburgers, festival T-shirts, Tibetan hats,
three-course meals served on white linen . . .
The increasing average age of the festival-goer is catered for by a host of
less tiring, or less noisy, activities. Even on the main stage the acts are
getting older. Almost first off on the first day was the 63-year-old
Australian Rolf Harris - who acknowledged that the crowd were laughing as
much at him as with him. Also well on the way to complimentary public
transport were The Kinks, The Velvet Underground, Van Morrison, Donovan and
Robert Plant.
This might be a reflection that Glastonbury is Europe's largest, and
probably oldest festival. There have been 14 such gatherings since the first
in 1970 - and apart from 1991, one every year since 1979. It is clear that
some of the earliest visitors are returning with their brood. Of course you
may think that most of the performers, traders and mystics are a match for
the rubbish around you. But you keep being reminded that there are many ways
to make a living - and those of whom you disapprove will happily show you
what makes them tick. That is what makes the festival special. So many
people come with such varied aims that the average tripper, with steady job
and mortgage, cannot fail to be enthralled.
Some 80,000 tickets at Pounds 58 were sold. Add to that the traders,
gatecrashers, freeloaders and security staff and a total attendance of at
least 100,000 is reached. From that almost 200 arrests were made, of which
the police say most were drug-related. But, as Chief Inspector Barry
Williams points out: '100,000 people compares with the size of a small
town.' To the security guards, the festival is just another day at work,
just another concert. But one hundred thousand burned and burnt-out fun
seekers think that it is very, very special.

LIKE WATER FOR HOT CHOCOLATE by Laura Esquivel Doubleday Pounds 13.99, 220
pages
EVASION by Francoise Sagan Severn House Pounds 13.99, 201 pages
A SEASON IN PURGATORY by Dominick Dunne Bantam Press Pounds 14.99, 377 pages
TO MAKE Mexican hot chocolate properly the water must be on the verge of
boiling over, a state that Tita, the heroine of this extraordinary novel,
all too often finds herself in. She is the youngest daughter of a prosperous
ranching family on the Mexican side of the border during the Revolution.
There was a popular literary tradition in 19th century Mexico summed up by
one authority as 'novels of customs, crimes and horrors' which were sold in
monthly instalment.
Laura Esquivel has cleverly married this predominantly masculine phenomenon
with its feminine counterpart, the woman's magazine, to produce in Like
Water For Hot Chocolate 'a Novel in Monthly Instalments with Recipes,
Romances and Home Remedies'.
Where a more conventional writer would concentrate on the exploits of Pancho
Villa's men, here their activities are only incidental to the dramas that
take place in Tita's kitchen as she performs heroic feats of cookery with
elaborate pre-Hispanic recipes.
Mama Elena insists that as the youngest daughter Tita must remain unmarried
in order to look after her in her old age. Pedro, the man she loves, marries
her sister in order to stay near Tita, which only adds to the complications.
Tita's strong passions have a way of affecting her cooking, and after a
particularly aphrodisiac dish of quail in rose petal sauce, her unmarried
sister Gertrudis, running naked through a field, is carried off by one of
Villa's men.
The recipes will delight armchair cooks with their detail and authenticity:
'The quail must be dry-plucked because putting them in boiling water affects
their flavour.' The same calm friendly tone is used to describe the chaotic
and often erotic events that accompany the cooking. In its modest way this
is a comic masterpiece.
There is good rustic cuisine of a more familiar sort in Francoise Sagan's
Evasion, a spirited piece of wartime nostalgia published in France in 1991
as Les Faux-Fuyants. Four Parisian socialites are trying to reach Lisbon and
thence New York in June 1940.
Their Chenard-Walcker is machine gunned by Stukas and they are rescued by a
'yokel' in a cart and taken to his family's farm somewhere in the Beaune -
'Cro-magnon territory' as Diane, the older woman calls it on first sight.
There is plenty of comedy in the encounter between the peasant family and
their uninvited guests: a middle-aged homosexual diplomat, Loic Lhermitte, a
busy society woman, Diane, 27-year-old Luce, whose husband is waiting in
Lisbon, and the gigolo Bruno, but it is not entirely predictable.
Because the yokel, Maurice, has been injured in their rescue Loic agrees to
help his widowed mother to get the harvest in, partly because he discovers
that he loves driving the combine harvester.
Bruno goes off on foot in a sulk and collapses with sunstroke only to be
woken by an amorous (male) half-wit. Luce and Maurice take a tumble in the
hay, and Diane, who has never even seen a raw courgette, strikes up a
genuine friendship with the earthy widow, Arlette.
Much of the humour lies in the incongruity of it all, Luce and Diane
wandering around the filthy farm in their beach pyjamas, Diane arranging the
placement of the harvest lunch as Arlette kills the chickens.
There is also some very funny dialogue, chiefly between Diane and Loic, who
have the maturity to see that they cannot actually learn something from
their hosts.
There is something very different about French social comedy - the dryness
of the wit, perhaps - which makes this highly enjoyable in spite of an
unaccomplished translation.
Dominick Dunne is presented as 'America's foremost chronicler of society
life'. Like the narrator of A Season In Purgatory, Harrison Burns, he has a
special interest in failures of justice.
Harrison Burns was a school friend of Constant Bradley, the brightest hope
of a fabulously wealthy and powerful Irish Catholic family. Constant is
destined for the White House, and nothing is going to stand in his way, not
even his unfortunate tendency to beat up women.
Harrison has not seen Constant for nearly 20 years, since he helped to
conceal Constant's responsibility for the death of a 25-year-old girl,
bludgeoned by a baseball bat. A series of new encounters with the Bradleys
convince him that he can no longer keep silent, and Constant is finally
charged with the murder.
Dunne writes intelligently, and organises his material superbly. His details
of life at the top are absolutely spot on, but I was not convinced that he
has really got hold of what his kind call the down-side. There is, for
example, nothing in his story even half way as shocking as the real events
of Chappaquiddick.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Lady Chatterley's trial - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MONDAY, to go with the television addicts' Lady Chatterley, Radio 4
repeated the transcript of the trial of Penguin Books for publishing the
book. It was alleged to be liable to 'deprave and corrupt'. The script was
compiled by Jack Emery, presented by Helena Kennedy and directed by John
Theocaris; the legal and literary experts were played by actors. The verdict
of Not Guilty was momentous; but the trial seems less interesting today than
it did then.
It was a simple case. For the defence, Gerald Gardiner QC (Frederick
Treeves) called nearly 20 witnesses, who between them agreed that the book
was of literary merit and profound social advantage. Words like 'sacred' and
'holy' were used. No subtleties arose about the value of the different
manuscript versions, now being discussed in connection with television.
For the prosecution, Mervyn Griffith-Jones QC (John Shrapnel) called no
witnesses at all, simply drawing attention to the passages describing what
he reckoned was indecent behaviour. The jury, nine mature men and three
mature women, found that Penguin had committed no offence.
Sunday evening brought another repeat on Radio 4, Paul Schlesinger's
Falstaff - A Voyage Round His Belly, last heard on Christmas Day, when we
were possibly busy watching something less intellectual.
It is not a voyage of discovery, only of appreciation. Everyone taking part
knows Falstaff like a neighbour and has only to point out some specific
quality. It was grand to hear some of the lines spoken by Donald Sinden, who
has not, so far, played it on stage; his encomium on 'good Sherris sack'
sent me straight to the pub.
Falstaff can take on various guises - the ambitious courtier, the useless
braggart and dishonest soldier, the old man in Shallow's garden, rejected
suitor, the helpless invalid we hear of but do not see. He is no clown,
simply the spirit of fun, yet always consistent - even in Boito's lines for
Verdi. I suspect he is the most immortal of all Shakespeare's people, more
universal than Hamlet, even. That wise old critic Kenneth Tynan specified
one attribute - always he was 'first a gentleman.' A most enjoyable
programme.
The Sunday Play on Radio 3 was Michael Wright's Mrs Klein, with three
characters, all women psychiatrists - Melanie Klein (Sarah Kestelman), her
daughter Melita (Juliet Stevenson), and Paula (Deborah Findlay), Melanie's
stand-in. They all have dreams, and are as ready to talk about these as the
real events of their lives. Melanie's son, Hans, has been killed climbing,
perhaps intentionally. There is much mutual dispute and earnest psychotalk.
Even with such able playing, I could not arouse much interest. The author
directed.
'You smell, madam,' said the precise Dr Johnson, 'I stink.' Radio 4's The
Joy of Smelling (Wednesday, first of three) told us how the lady might stink
 -of lavender for example, but also how we should smell her. Tiny particles
carry different scents; they are of varying size and shape, and are absorbed
only where they fit, so separating the assorted niffs. Naturally, we end up
with a special part of the brain.
Michael Collie and Dr George Dodd, who told us all this, had other, less
pleasing, things to say. We smell - I mean stink - of what we eat, which for
the average Britain means meaty, cheesy, sweaty odours that other peoples,
with different diets, may find horrid - although they will no doubt have
problems of their own.
Dealers in such items as tea, coffee and especially wine, must keep their
smelling keen, and can practise in places such as the London Underground. We
shall never know, unless someone tells us, if we have bad breath; the brain
gets used to it.
While we are on the senses, on Monday Radio 4 will give us Questions of
Taste, but this is not scientific, just a culinary quiz.

IT IS one thing to write a best-selling book called The Prize: The Epic
Quest For Oil, Money and Power detailing the personalities, history and
geopolitics of the world's largest industry, as Daniel Yergin did last year
(it won a Pulitzer prize) and quite another to turn such a book into eight
hours of gripping television documentary.
The power of a book lies in its words, and the supply of words is free and
limitless. Television has to have pictures and those pictures can prove hard
to find when the story begins as long ago as the 1850s and extends into such
crevices of history as the Japanese scheme to produce aviation fuel from
pine roots, or Marcus Samuel's ability to run 14 oil tankers out of an
office with two chairs, two clerks, and a small map of the world. Yet
somehow The Prize, which begins on BBC2 at 9pm tomorrow evening, manages to
put it all on screen.
Not that there is anything particularly unusual about the technique which,
even today, is probably best exemplified by the Thames Television series The
World At War: extracts from archives, supplemented by still photographs, are
combined with new interviews from people with long memories, and in the case
of The Prize frequent up-summers from Yergin. Then the parts are sewn
together with a powerful spoken script. The American version, which was
available for preview, is narrated by the admirably unintrusive Donald
Sutherland, but on BBC2 the job will be done by actor Andrew Sachs - one of
the best in the business.
From a British point of view, what seems a little worrying is that this is a
form where Britain once excelled, but The World At War appeared 20 years ago
and, although we have subsequently had excellent series from Peter
Pagnamenta and Brian Lapping (All Our Working Lives and End Of Empire), they
were made in 1984 and 1985. The Americans, however, appear to be on a roll.
Not so long ago America's tiny public service broadcasting outfit, PBS,
produced The Civil War, a magnificent example of the classical documentary,
and now here they are with The Prize. British programme makers must look to
their laurels.
The series begins with the discovery that 'rock oil' could supply cheaper
fuel for oil lamps than whale oil, and proceeds via the history of Standard
Oil, Royal Dutch, Shell and BP to the two world wars, the rise of the motor
car, the Middle East wars and the development of OPEC. It ends by looking to
the future, when environmental considerations may become even more powerful
than the multinational oil companies.
There are moments when you are reminded of schools programmes, and times
when more information would be welcome, but they are rare. Most of the time
this series is as engrossing as Dallas.
Produced by William Cran, it uses a different director for each of the eight
programmes, which are broadly chronological, and each is - pleasingly -
slightly different in form. Tomorrow's opening episode is built around two
fascinating people: John D. Rockefeller, one of those ruthless Christians
who would do anything, often destroying people's livelihoods, in order to
make money, much of which he then gave to charity; and Ida Tarbell, whose
father was one of those damaged by Rockefeller and who became one of
America's earliest investigative journalists, writing the articles which
eventually smashed Rockefeller's Standard Oil to pieces.
Larger-than-life individuals are also at the centre of next week's episode,
but the structure is necessarily different because more people have become
involved. There are the Nobel brothers, known to most of us for dynamite and
prizes, who developed the Russian oil industry; Marcus Samuel, Lord Mayor of
London, whose family firm imported shells to make boxes for Victorian ladies
and who named the world's first tanker fleet 'Cowrie', 'Murex' and so on,
and the Shell company itself; Henri Deterding, whose Royal Dutch company
combined with Shell; and Winston Churchill, who set in train a momentous
sequence of events when, as First Lord of the Admiralty, he persuaded the
British government to buy 51 per cent of Anglo-Persian, later BP.
When you think about it there is no other product, not coal, nor steel, nor
cotton, and no other business, not even the food industry, which has had
such profound and universal effects on life on this planet as has oil. That
alone does not make a good documentary series, of course, but since The
Prize happens to be an outstanding piece of work it does make for compelling
viewing.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Redgrave's return
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 15 years' absence, Vanessa Redgrave returns to the Royal Exchange
Theatre, Manchester, in Maybe, a play about the McCarthy trials in America
during the 1950s. It makes sporadically good drama, although the play has
still to find its focus.
Maybe tells two entwined stories of 1950s left-wing America. First of James
(John Bennett), a third generation immigrant academic writing a biography
about his film-director father Alan (also John Bennett). Second of Barbara
(Margaret Robertson), a Polish emigre who reveals the past by telling of her
friendship with him. Between them, his lover Lynn (Vanessa Redgrave),
daughter of a mutual friend to Barbara and Alan, mediates past and present
by acting out the memories of her mother, Patricia (also Vanessa Redgrave).
This complicated situation appears clear enough on stage, with clever
cutting between the 1950s and the 1990s, and good acting to differentiate
between present and past. The characters stick to their cultural
stereotypes. So Jewish left-wing represented by Alan and Barbara, meets old
Boston in Patricia to forge an uneasy trio summoned before the Committee for
Un-American Activities in 1952.
Most creeds are right in what they affirm and wrong in what they deny. The
Truman doctrine in the 1940s and McCarthyism in the 1950s failed to account
for the changing state of things in Europe. The position for anti-fascists
in the 1930s was untenable: to be anti-communist as well was to give succour
to Hitler by attacking Stalin. But Maybe never shows, even in its fine trial
scene, just what was at stake during that period. After all, 40 years ago,
Julius and Ethel Rosenburg were executed at Sing Sing, New York, for passing
atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, then indirectly at war with the US in
Korea.
What emerges from the tangle on stage is part political history and part
psychotherapy. James/Alan figures out who he is in writing the biography;
Barbara confesses that she named names at the Committee hearing; and
Lynn/Patricia unites the traumas of the past with the demands of the
present. But the dialogue lacks subtlety: 'Were you really a communist in
the 30s?' 'Who wasn't, in those days?' The programme records that Redgrave
suggested the idea to writer Mikhail Shatrov and adapter Keith Reddin. It
makes a good vehicle for the parts which give scope to her talent.
Although Redgrave is not at her best in this difficult part, her acting is
so strong that she draws fine performances from Robertson and Bennett. She
argues so well on stage, twitching at a cardigan, tugging at the hair; that
those opposite her, including Melanie Thaw as an errant daughter, respond to
the strength and energy. Robertson and Bennett move easily into the
flashback scenes, reeling back the years.
Braham Murray's direction differentiates nicely between times, but leaves
the actors looking uncertain over detail and props. Rehearsal should cure
that. The patrician interior set blends Bostonian plainness and grandeur
such that the drawing room easily transforms to the committee room. But
Senator Joseph McCarthy, even in one of the drinking bouts which eventually
killed him in 1957, could not have imagined the dissolution of the Soviet
Union so quickly. History makes fools of us all.

HISTORY AND ITS IMAGES: ART AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PAST by Francis
Haskell Yale Pounds 29.95, 558 pages
FEW READERS contemplating this well-produced tome with about 500 pages of
heavily footnoted text and 262 varied illustrations are likely to suspect
that beneath its academic surface it carries an explosive charge. For the
author is out to challenge a conviction of which he methodically traces the
origins and the vicissitudes, the conviction dear to many art historians,
that visual evidence surviving from the past in the form of monuments and
images must be accorded equal status to written testimonials presented in
chronicles, charters or archival documents.
It is well known that, in this country at least, this opinion gained ground
very slowly. Shortly before the Chair of Art History was established at
Oxford University which is held by Francis Haskell with such distinction, I
attended a meeting at that University in my temporary role as Slade
Professor of Fine Art at which historians were asked whether they would
favour such an innovation. Most of them were distinctly lukewarm. One of
them suggested that military architecture - the fortifications of mediaeval
castles - might present a welcome addition to the history syllabus, but most
of them considered the cultivation of art history the job of museum curators
and collectors who, of course, counted outstanding specialists among their
ranks. It is true that John Ruskin in The Stones of Venice had undertaken
long ago to link the rise and fall of the city with the history of its
architecture, but this flawed work of genius (splendidly analysed here by
Haskell) hardly commended such an approach to hard-headed historians.
It may indeed be argued that it was only the arrival from the continent of
art historians nurtured in a different tradition that ultimately breached
the fortress of higher education. However much these new arrivals may have
differed in their methods, most of them were agreed (to use Professor
Haskell's words) that 'in principle figurative art could provide some direct
insight into the past.'
The chapter of the book from which this formulation is taken is headed 'The
Deceptive Evidence of Art'. It might have served as a title of the whole
book. But anyone familiar with the author's previous publications will
hardly go wrong if he locates its germ-cell in the preceding chapter on 'The
Historical Significance of Style', more precisely in the pages devoted to
Hippolyte Taine's interpretation of Jesuit church interiors as a deliberate
effort to dazzle and convert the populace with 'all the sweetmeats of pious
confectionary'. Haskell comments tersely that 'modern scholars . . . have
invalidated the notion of a politically motivated Jesuit art'. He does not
say that quite early in his career he was one of those 'modern scholars';
indeed, his seminal book of 30 years ago on Patrons and Painters which
contains much of the evidence is even absent from his bibliography.
We may well surmise that Haskell branched out from this base, ingesting the
validity of similar conclusions in the centuries before and after Hippolyte
Taine. We are reminded in a series of 16 brilliant chapters how, long before
art history existed as a branch of learning, numismatics had claimed a
similar special relationship to history, as did the budding discipline of
antiquarian studies represented by such towering figures as Montfaucon. And
on to Winckelmann and such pioneers of cultural history as William Roscoe,
the biographer of Lorenzo de Medici.
He devotes memorable chapters to Alexandre Lenoir's Musee des Monuments
Francais, to Michelet and Jacob Burckhardt, to historians of popular imagery
and caricature, notably Champfleury and those visionaries of our own century
who even wanted to interpret artistic movements as prophecies of things to
come. Haskell concludes his survey surprisingly but convincingly with an
account of the great Dutch historian Jan Huizinga, whom he enlists as an
ally, since he too was inclined to question the evidential value of the arts
which meant so much to him.
Let no one fear, however, that in these packed pages he will encounter
indigestible lists of names and dates. Everywhere the author excels in his
well-proven gift of vividly describing the protagonists of his story as if
he had been personally acquainted with them. No-one reading the beautiful
last chapter is likely to forget the picture of Courajod, who 'would sit at
a green baize table onto which he would sling his sets of photographs as if
they were exhibits in some important trial. The oil lamp was so placed that
his face remained in darkness and only his hands were brightly lit.' Or his
descriptions of James Weale, an Englishman who is familiar to most of us
only as a name in the bibliography of early Flemish painting, as 'a lean,
tall figure with wide yet stooping shoulders, clad in a grey coat of
unfashionable cut, moving with shambling gait on out-turned feet; a full
grey beard; and shortsighted eyes peering through spectacles from beneath
the widest brim imaginable of a black felt hat.'
Here, as in his earlier books, the author puts his conviction to the test
'that to try to follow the emotions and reasoning of particular historians
looking at specific works of art offers by far the most rewarding way of
coming to terms even with the most abstract ideas that are discussed in this
book'. Indeed, he quotes the Comte de Caylus, the great antiquarian, for the
opinion that 'the antiquarian should shun every kind of system: I look upon
them as an illness of the spirit.'
Is it unfair to suspect that Haskell has a good deal of sympathy for this
opinion? This might explain the puzzling fact that he all but passes over
the highly influential 'system' of G B Vico with which he is of course fully
familiar but which he leaves on one side on the grounds that Vico 'was not
interested in art'. True, but it was Vico whose New Science replaced the
story of individuals by the study of collectives, postulating a law of
evolution leading civilisation from primitive stages to the dominance of
human reason.
Admittedly, it was mainly law and poetry that had to serve him as evidence,
but it was soon apparent that the visual arts also fitted snugly into this
system. When Vasari or others had described the evolution of art in terms of
organic growth and decay they considered the arts in isolation. Now this
growth could be seen as yet another symptom of the evolution of mankind.
There are traces of this conception in Winckelmann but the varying forms of
evolutionism that dominated historiography in the 19th century made it hard
to resist the conclusion that 'primitive' styles of art that shared certain
characteristics with the art of children betokened the primitive mentality
of the 'childhood of mankind.'
Most of the historians considered by Haskell subscribed to this dubious
'system.' It may well be argued that not before this fatal link between the
theory of evolution and the study of human history is finally broken will it
be possible to separate the legitimate use of visual evidence from those
beguiling fantasies with which the author has so heroically wrestled in this
important book.

17F:THE LIFE OF IAN FLEMING by Donald McCormick Peter Owen Pounds 18.50, 232
pages
IN 1966 John Pearson wrote a good biography of Ian Fleming, who had died,
only 56, two years before. Its weakness was that it became extremely sketchy
about the last years, so much so that many readers must have guessed that
Pearson had run into problems, presumably with the widow, Ann, formerly Lady
Rothermere.
This book, which is no way a serious biography and scarcely a 'reappraisal'
as claimed but a series of observations on Fleming's interesting life, is
free of that inhibition. Donald McCormick, aka Richard Deacon, is a former
journalist colleague of Fleming and an frequent author in the spy stakes. He
was one of Fleming's stringers after the war and writes about him with
affection.
Not surprisingly, McCormick confirms that the Ian/Ann marriage had been
difficult for years. He did not enjoy her social life and she was
contemptuous of his creation of James Bond; their lives had moved apart and
his final years do not sound happy. The interest here is to signal various
items missing from Pearson which may one day figure in another biography.
The emphasis lies on the war years with Naval Intelligence.
For example, there was a Polish woman friend called Christine Granville, a
brave and distinguished Second War spy, later murdered, who may have been
'Vesper Lynd' in Casino Royale. There was also an important German woman
friend called Vanessa Hoffman with a mysterious role inside Nazi Germany who
seems to have vanished without trace. Similarly, we did not know that in the
war Fleming was once involved with Aleister Crowley in astrological and
occult ceremonies which eventually may have influenced Rudolf Hess's flight
to Scotland. More, please.
It also seems to be suggested that Fleming's establishment of the 'Mercury'
news service for the Kemsley papers in the 1940s, in particular for the
Sunday Times, had links with British Intelligence: in view of the stick the
Observer was later to take for its hiring of Philby, the subject has more
than curiosity value.
We could do with another life of Fleming, not because he invented James Bond
but because he was an interesting Establishment figure. The fact that Bond
became a bore - as his creator understood better than anyone  - does not
deny that.

A BUNDLE FROM BRITAIN by Alistair Horne Macmillan Pounds 17.99, 333 pages
ALISTAIR Horne was bundled from Britain to America in July 1940, aged 14,
one of thousands of schoolchildren evacuated to America in the early part of
the war before the threat from U-boats made the crossing too dangerous and
the evacuations were halted. Now an accomplished historian and the author of
the recent biography of Harold Macmillan, he evokes in marvellous detail the
perils and pleasures of growing up in America, not least his release from an
English boarding school education made unbearable by snobbery and bullying,
and his welcome into the warm and unaffected environment of a Bostonian
family clan.
What his American family found when they unwrapped their bundle was not
exactly lovable. 'I was a jangle of complexes and inhibitions, with the
instinctive snarl of the mongrel waiting to be kicked, without a shred of
self-confidence or dignity.' For that, perhaps, partly blame the death of
his mother, Auriol, when he was five and a single childhood spent with a
succession of governesses, one of whom he later seduced when she visited him
at Cambridge ('She had an engaging way of saying at the appropriate moment,
'Was that nice?' - much as I remember her enquiring after I had gobbled up
one of Cook's puddings'). One of the charms of Horne's book is the vignettes
he provides of vanished worlds, helped by the fact that his mother wrote
everything down and threw nothing away, even her dance cards.
Born into the Scottish aristocracy, she became a pioneering woman journalist
and a star of 1920s high-life, following the example of her aunt Maggie, a
legendary Edwardian hostess, who had married into the Grevilles and kept
court at Polesdon Lacey. Marriage to James Horne, 18 years her senior and
the possessor of a small fortune acquired in India, was not a success.
Horne's father retreated to the Oriental Club, and his mother's social world
whirled faster until she died in a car accident.
When he was not being bullied, Horne junior seems to have spent most of his
schooldays trying to build incendiary devices from chemistry sets in the
school shed at Ludgrove, where the Royal princes William and Harry are
presently schooled. Horne thinks it must have improved. It needed to: 'To
me, in its humbug, snobbery and rampant, unchecked bullying, it came to
represent everything that, all through the rest of my life, I most disliked
about England.' Thrown into a large, exuberant American family, his first
response to sharing a tiny twin-bedded attic with the eldest son is to ask,
'But where's my sitting room?' Gregariousness soon knocks the edges off this
awkward young English boy abroad, even as he anxiously listens to the news
bulletins from England. And as America inched towards involvement on the
Allies' side, Horne paints a vivid picture of the arguments between
Isolationists and Interventionists being played out between 15-year-olds in
the classroom and on the tennis courts of Martha's Vineyard.
Volunteering for the RAF, via Canada, Horne finally returns to England, to
find that the family seat has been sold and that conditions are far worse
than his heroically phlegmatic father ever let on. Father and son enjoy an
all too brief rapprochement; only a few months later his father falls and
fractures his skull while walking home from the Oriental Club in the
black-out.
For all such sadnesses, though, this is an exuberant book, which describes,
with honesty and humanity, a childhood played out against the backdrop of
some of the most momentous history this century.

THE LANGUAGE OF THE GENES by Steve Jones HarperCollins Pounds 16.99, 251
pages
IF ALL the people in the world were boiled down into a soup, Steve Jones
tells us, they would just about fill Lake Windermere. The interesting thing
is that the genetic diversity discernible in such a soup would be very
small: all humans are closely related because their evolution is such a
recent event.
Seen through the lens of genetic science, humankind's nature and history
appear fascinating, extraordinary, and sometimes terrifying. The lens is
focused for us by Steve Jones, Professor of Genetics at University College
London. He demonstrated his remarkable gifts as a communicator in the Reith
Lectures of 1991, from which this book stems. In literate and highly
readable style he explains genetics and uses it to take us on a tour of
human existence.
One of Jones's aims is to rescue genetics from its doubtful past, when Nazis
and others sought to pervert it into eugenics. A second aim is to suggest
what can and cannot be expected from genetics, especially in its medical
applications. But his chief aim is to demonstrate genetics in action as an
instrument of self-knowledge, revealing 'an extraordinary picture of what we
are, what we were, and what we may become.'
Jones works at University College's Galton Laboratory, named after the
eccentric polymath Francis Galton, whose interests were amazingly diverse:
they included an attempt to measure the size of African women's buttocks
from a distance by means of 'a sextant and the principles of surveying'.
Galton was the first theorist of human eugenics, whose aim, he announced,
was 'to check the birth rate of the Unfit and to improve the race by
furthering the productivity of the fit.' His ideas, together with those of
Charles Darwin, had a powerful effect on the 19th and 20th centuries, with
appalling consequences as we too well know. But the science of genetics,
Jones says, despite having the shadow of eugenics still lying across it, has
at last come of age.
Genetics is the investigation of how individuals inherit physical and
behavioural traits from their ancestors. Central to this enquiry is the
concept of the gene, the basic unit of heredity. A gene is a packet of
chemical information consisting of DNA. The collection of all such packets
in an individual is called his 'genome'; the data it contains is equivalent
in amount to a billion-page telephone directory. Geneticists are close to
being able to 'read' the entire genome, and when they can they will not only
know which ancestors gave us our coloration, height and other
characteristics, but they will be able to tell us something of our fate also
(for example, what diseases we are prone to suffer).
Jones shows that genetics has already taught us much. After explaining the
nature and functioning of genes, and how our genetic past lingers in our
present, he takes us through an unfolding series of topics, a chapter on
each. They include human evolutionary history; the development of language,
agriculture and urbanisation; the effects of disease; the question of race;
the promise and danger of genetic engineering; and the genetic prospects for
humanity's future. Each is utterly absorbing.
Take the problem of disease, the 'unremitting enemy' as Jones calls it. It
is one of the most potent agents for genetic change. Plagues come - the
Black Death, AIDS - and go when immunity develops; but sometimes at a high
cost, as with sickle-cell anaemia, prevalent among Africans whose red blood
cells mutated to resist malaria. Some diseases had to wait until populations
grew sufficiently large; measles, for example, needs a base of half a
million people to survive. New strains of some diseases periodically migrate
to humans from animals; novel strains of Asiatic flu start with ducks on
Chinese farms and reach people via pigs every few years.
One surprising lesson Jones teaches is that the evolution of agriculture
seems to have been, at best, a mixed blessing. Before it happened people had
a much more diverse diet and lived in healthier places. With agriculture
came private property and taxes. Hunter-gatherers have it easier than
farmers and urbanites; bushmen spend only 15 hours a week getting sustenance
for their families, much less than half the time spent by agricultural and
industrial workers. God's remark to Adam about eating his bread in the sweat
of his brow seems prescient.
Jones performs a useful service in demolishing myths about race. Humans
share 98 per cent of their genes with their closest ape relatives. But all
humans are genetically closer to one another than are, for example,
orangutans living on neighbouring islands. Human differences in eye shape,
hair type and skin pigment are strictly superficial. 'I have always felt a
certain compassion,' Jones drily remarks, 'for those whose ability to
despise their fellow men is limited by the colour of their victim's skin.'
But it is humanity's newly-acquired control over its genetic destiny which
makes us mistrust the future. Scientists dislike prognostication, but Jones
bravely asks: how will our genetic destiny be affected by our increased
knowledge, our younger reproductive ages, our dramatically increased
'outbreeding' or population mixing, our ageing populations, our pollution
problems, and much besides? As you would expect, his answers are both
fascinating and startling.

WAR IN ITALY 1943-1945: A BRUTALSTORY by Richard Lamb John Murray Pounds
19.99, 336 pges
ALL TOO infrequently a military history is published that, conforming to the
highest standards of scholarship, comprehensively rewrites a known passage
of warfare. Richard Lamb's War in Italy is unquestionably such a book.
There is nothing that compares with it in English, and very little in
Italian. National pride and national embarrassment have inhibited due
scrupulousness in the latter language. There are any number of partisan
memoirs, but these address only one strand in the story. And, as the author
argues, the partisan war was itself a blemished enterprise.
Lamb takes as his starting point the September 8 armistice. With its army
beaten in Africa and the Allies poised to launch an invasion of its
mainland, Italy had already experienced disaster as a consequence of
Mussolini's rule and his alliance with Hitler. But the armistice turned
disaster into nightmare.
Following Field Marshal Messe's surrender at Tunis on May 7 1943, King
Victor Emmanuel III ordered Mussolini's arrest on July 25, replacing him
with Badoglio, another Field-Marshal. Badoglio then sued, as best he could,
for peace with the British and Americans. The Allies, distrusting
yesterday's enemy, insisted on unconditional surrender as the necessary
precondition to any pact against the Germans. Tragically, no proper plans
were made to use surviving native forces to expel German divisions from
Italy. Kesselring was given breathing space, which he used adroitly to
secure Rome and make the Reich's southern flank as difficult to overcome as
possible.
This was an enormous setback for Field Marshal Alexander, but it was an even
greater setback for the Italian nation. After 40 days in power Badolglio had
to vacate the capital. He, the King and a skeleton government removed to
Brindisi. Amid the confusion Mussolini was allowed to escape. With German
connivance, a new republic was established at Salo in the North, plunging
Italy into civil war.
One of several myths Richard Lamb debunks is the timidity of the Italian
soldier. Many Italians would happily have died for their country. The
problem was in knowing against whom they should die. Soon there were two
armies of occupation - the Allies' as well as the Germans. It was the
political failures of 1943 that corroded the vigour and integrity of Italian
arms. Paradoxically Italy as a nation might have fared better had she stuck
by Germany, for at least she would not then have had to suffer German
reprisals at what Hitler considered a savage betrayal.
Those reprisals too often took the form of the vilest atrocities. The
Ardeatine Cave massacre is infamous. Less publicised were the quantitively
greater massacres of Italian troops in the Adriatic and in the Aegean. In
the eastern waters of the Mediterranean the Reich's garrisons were manned by
mixed German and Italian forces. When - following the armistice and
Badoglio's instructions to resist only when fire was offered - some Italian
units did not immediately surrender to their former allies, the German line
was simple: slaughter them.
Italy also suffered at the hands of the Allies, whose bombing raids against
the German-occupied zone regularly caused havoc among the civilian
population. But there was mischief too of the Italians' own making. The
partisans, operating against the German military, were not a united front.
On the one hand were the patriotic Green Flames, on the other the communist
Garibaldi brigades.
At the final collapse in 1945 both groups took what little law there was
into their own hands. Alleged former fascists were indiscriminately
murdered, while some Garibaldi elements abetted Tito's bloody attempts to
wrest control of the north-east. Concurrently General de Gaulle, with scant
regard for either Allied or Italian wishes, tried to annex part of Piedmont.
In a ploy that was as scurrilous as it is shocking, ballot papers attached
to ration cards were distributed amongst the local populace in a bid to get
them to vote for French suzerainity. And so on. In short, a devastating
tapestry of misfortune interwoven with duplicity.
What lessons can be learned? The first and overwhelming is the most
familiar: human nastiness. The second is: beware making war with one's
ideological friends. The third: beware even more of abandoning them half-way
through.
Richard Lamb restitches every thread. One of many ghosts he lays is the
alleged quiescence of Pope Pius XII. More than anyone Pius grasped the
futility of protest against the Nazis. Instead he wisely kept his head below
the parapet, in which position he clandestinely succoured not only many
ethnic Italians, but not a few Jews as well.
The strength of War in Italy is its familiarity with many hitherto
unexploited sources, and its judiciousness in handling them. That said, it
should be pointed out that Lamb's survey is not a popular account of events.
Each chapter is a study of a particular aspect of his subject. But no-one
with a serious interest either in Italy's War or contemporary Italian
society can afford to ignore it.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Property (Eastern Europe): Pitfalls that await the unwary -
So you're moving to eastern Europe. Audrey Powell looks at the problems of
finding a home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU WORK for one of the companies spreading out to take advantage of the
opportunities opening up across eastern Europe. Where might you be sent and
what sort of living conditions would you have?
Pauline Sheerman, head of the Confederation of British Industry's eastern
Europe department, says you would probably go to Poland, Hungary, the Czech
republic, Russia or Romania. What happens then depends on the company.
A large group might rent a whole building, using part for offices and the
rest as accommodation. But even major companies have to test the water first
and send out a few staff with the pioneering spirit. After the initial spell
in a hotel, their experiences can be varied. Rented flats may be scarce, or
simply hard to find in places where letting agents are not part of the
scene. Local office staff may have to fulfil that role.
Beware of renting something that could be the subject of a restitution
claim. 'Unfurnished' can mean no lights, carpets or kitchen units. Often,
telephones can take months to be connected. There are many pitfalls for the
unwary.
Ion Florescu and Marek Scidor-Rylski are co-authors of Making a Success of
Joint Ventures in Eastern Europe, a CBI book just published.* Florescu, who
is Anglo-Romanian, is general manager of a London-based company and visits
Romania each month.
He warns that accommodation for people going there to work is 'very basic';
as a result, many foreigners live permanently in hotels. While there are
some agents in Bucharest, generally you have to rent privately from local
people, who might sub-let a flat in a house. It is difficult to find a
modern, well-kept apartment.
Florescu says: 'For a shabby, two-room apartment in the centre of Bucharest,
you will pay Pounds 500 a month, with rent three to six months in advance.
You will probably need to employ someone to re-decorate before you move in,
and you have no security over the accommodation.'
Scidor-Rylski is Anglo-Polish. He is with a Canadian-quoted company
investing in eastern Europe and spends half his time in Poland. He says:
'Everybody can and does own property there. There are plenty of apartments.'
A small flat in a tall building - functional but austere - should cost
Pounds 300-Pounds 500 a month.
The problem is lack of offices, not flats, although some hotels will arrange
for you to use an office on another floor, or adjacent to your room. But the
worst thing about living in Warsaw is car theft. 'Take a good immobiliser,'
he advises.
Some new arrivals in eastern Europe have had a few problems. Nick Gera works
in Sofia, Bulgaria, for London-based chartered accountant Touche Ross. He
rents a five-bedroom, semi-detached house with garage 'and over-run garden'
in a village six miles out of the city for Pounds 840 a month and lives
there by himself.
Gera found it through a contact when he went earlier to Sofia to work on a
temporary project. He advises anyone who can to go there before moving - for
a holiday, perhaps - so they can look for accommodation at leisure.
Finding it is not difficult, Gera says, because plenty of people in Sofia
have built houses in surrounding villages to let to foreigners. While they
often seek ambitious rents, he knows of deals agreed at a third of the
asking figure.
Do not sign the first contract offered, Gera advises, and watch out for any
'nasty' clauses. Get the lease fixed for as long as possible - a request for
renewal will result in a demand for increased rent.
William Touche, senior manager of Touche Ross and a great-grandson of the
firm's founder, has just returned to London after 2 1/2 years in Moscow
(Touche Ross has about a dozen offices in eastern Europe). At first, he
lived in a hotel with his wife and baby. 'With all the property state-owned,
it was extremely difficult to find anyone to let apartments,' he says.
Ingenuity was called for. Of the limited options, an apartment in a leafy
boulevard in central Moscow appealed. Unfortunately, it already had tenants:
a psychiatrist, her mother, child and divorced husband. She was anxious for
him to go so Touche paid seven months' advance rent; this allowed the man to
get a co-operative flat elsewhere. With the aid of brokers, a smaller flat
was found for the psychiatrist and her family.
The firm paid the rent for this, plus Pounds 700 a month for the boulevard
apartment with its four rooms and parquet floors, and Touche moved in. When
he left Moscow in April, his replacement took it over.
Finding accommodation in Moscow became easier, and renting it much cheaper,
after the coup in 1991, he says. Now, there are more brokers who will fix up
deals. At first, they stuck notices in phone booths; today, they advertise
in English-language newspapers.
Although there are a number of relocation companies in Britain, few can help
over moves to eastern Europe. But one that does is Hamptons Relocation in
Swindon, Wiltshire (tel. 0793-619 555). Quoting from its comprehensive
information sheets: 'Prague is becoming busy with Americans and Japanese.
This has led to a dramatic increase in rental prices.'
It gives the average monthly rental for a three-bedroom furnished property
there as Pounds 1,835, and Pounds 1,282-2,565 for a similar-sized property
in Warsaw. Hamptons adds: 'In Budapest, Hungary, apartments are generally
rather small, with few in the three- to four-bedroom category. But there is
a fair amount available . . .'
The agency likes to meet clients, with their families, at their UK homes to
take details of their requirements, says international relocation manager
Anita Saunders. It will tell them what they can expect in the area sought,
and its representative there will inspect suitable properties and show
clients a selection. It also handles negotiations and rental terms.
'Just give us the moving date,' adds Saunders, 'and the property should be
ready.' Fee: Pounds 2,250.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Property (Eastern Europe): Prague, no place for the
short-term view - Buying in Europe's most scenic city needs care but prices
look certain to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRAGUE property prices soared after the release from communism. Now, the
signs are that they will stabilise at lower levels as the Czech Republic
adjusts to becoming a market economy. There is also the matter of producing
a reliable legal framework for transferring real estate. So, at this
difficult stage, take your time if you want to buy a flat or house in one of
Europe's most scenic cities.
Look around and talk to as many Czechs as you can. Then, buy not for the
short term but on a medium to long view - there will be no quick return on
your money at west European rates.
It helps if you are either Czech, have a Czech parent or live permanently
there already. If you do not qualify on any of those grounds, the first
essential is to set up a joint venture company (although this need not, in
fact, be joint - you can provide all the capital). This leads to a long-stay
residence permit which, after eight years, qualifies you for permanent
residence.
So says Nicholas Kirke, of Agentura Kirke, who has written two useful
pamphlets*: The Prague Property Market and Buying Apartments in Prague. He
adds that the initial capital required can be as low as Kc100,000 (Pounds
2,300).
To save money, go directly to a Czech lawyer (he will charge less than a
British one - who would have to use a Czech attorney in the end, anyway).
One special problem is restitution - the return to its owners, or their
heirs, of property confiscated after the communists took over in 1948. Care
is needed to ensure titles are clear.
So, where to buy? The Old Town (or Mala Strana), the charming old settlement
across the Charles Bridge, will appeal instantly but properties are very
difficult to find. You might get lucky if you are willing to take on a house
with sitting tenants and help them to move elsewhere. That would take time,
but you would not necessarily have to pay money to empty the flats.
House bought, you would be able to renovate the flats and charge more rent
than the average Pounds 12 a month a Czech pays for a two-room apartment
(which includes a 100 per cent rise last July). But be prepared for hassles
with the builders - and to find that a glorious, newly-painted baroque
facade has hidden rot behind it.
Kirke says vendors do not know what to ask and prices are tricky. He feels
the situation in central Prague will ease when vendors stop selling occupied
houses as if they were empty. At present, you could face a demand for
Dollars 1m for such a house on the island beneath the Charles Bridge.
There are two government valuations on property, although these are of
limited help to foreigners in assessing the price. One is for local taxes;
weighted in favour of newer houses, it could be far below the market value
in the Old Town.
The other is for a special tax on sales to foreigners (the law says the
vendor must pay this but buyers usually end up footing the bill). It is a
theoretical valuation based on what the property might fetch in other
European capitals. As the tax ranges from 4 per cent of this value to 11.375
per cent, it can be an expensive extra.
An alternative is to live 10 minutes away from the city centre in a
well-built 1920s' or 1930s' apartment block.
Kirke suggests you could buy the whole building for between Pounds 60,000
and Pounds 100,000, use the cheap and easy public transport, and rent out
what you do not need for yourself.
*The pamphlets cost Kc50 (Kc100 or equivalent abroad, cash with order) from
Agentura Kirke, Perlova 1, 11001 Prague 1 (tel: 010-42-2-264 378).

FT  03 JUL 93 / Travel: The land of Ali Pasha - In the remote Pindus
Mountains, Nicholas Woodsworth finds a more beguiling, wilder Greece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM all for progress. I am even soft-headed enough to believe in unified
European economic development. At least, I was until a few weeks ago, when I
drove northwards from Athens through the heart of mainland Greece. If this
is progress, I decided somewhere between Thebes and Meteora, then we should
give up on the idea altogether and let the Americans and Japanese get on
with it.
I did not expect leafy Arcadian landscapes dotted with temples and statues.
I was even willing to admit that the Greece written of by Patrick Leigh
Fermor 40 years ago - a Greece of old and vibrant rural traditions - might
have disappeared. Who are we, after all, in our demands for peasants on
donkeys or picturesque poverty? Mere cultural voyeurs, tourists with more
money than sensibility.
But I was not prepared for the wasteland each new vista opened up. In their
rush to catch up with the rest of Europe, the Greeks seem to have left
something of their Greekness, and their own sensibility, behind.
Could this be the same race that developed the architecture of harmonious
proportions, the aesthetic of man at one with nature? As I drove along I
found it difficult to believe.
Central Greece's towns were unrelievedly drab, an unzoned confusion of
industrial hangars, squat apartment blocks, grubby motor repair shops and
empty spaces strewn with rubble. Remarkable in their ugliness, villages of
unsurfaced breeze-blocks and concrete-slab roofs lay scattered across the
vast, flat farmlands of Thessaly. Everywhere, rusty reinforcing rods
protruded, precursors to the next desperate phase of gimcrack construction.
Despite the wild flowers and sunshine of spring, roadside landfill projects
managed to turn parts of even the deepest countryside into a rubbish tip.
I felt depressed. After only 40 years of modern European development, the
birthplace of western civilisation looks like a dump. I was tempted to turn
around and, like the great majority of visitors here, head for the tourist
enclaves of the Greek islands and coasts; at least the commercialism of sea,
sun and sand is predictable.
But I did not. In some distant corner of the mainland an older, more
distinctive Greece, a Greece in touch not with its classical roots but
simply its recent past, had to exist.
It does. At Kalambaka I turned west and began climbing the first of a series
of switchbacks leading up 6,000ft to the Katara pass. The warm Easter
weekend sun disappeared, as did cultivated fields, flowers, leafy trees and
Thessaly's ghastly village clutter.
In a thick fog I climbed up past the dead yellow grass of early spring.
Higher still, I ran into winter itself - snow blanketed the mountain's pine
forests and at the top of the pass a cold wind whipped a new fall of snow
sideways across the windshield. When the road came down again and the snow
disappeared I was still in Greece, but not the same country I had left
behind.
Wedged in between the Pindus mountain range and Albanian border, Epirus is
the poorest, most isolated province in the nation. It has little to do with
the popular image of Greece as a wine-soaked, sun-kissed land of hedonism.
With the most distinctive regional identity on the mainland, it is instead
an area that draws its character and history from its ruggedness, from the
peaks and valleys, rivers and gorges of the Pindus mountains themselves. The
further one goes into the fastness of the Pindus, the more one forgets that
Greece is rushing pell-mell and none too tidily into the 21st century.
Epirus's historic isolation from the rest of the country is reflected even
in Ioannina, its busy capital. In the company of holidaying Epirots I spent
an Easter Sunday morning on the shores of Lake Pamvotis, the tree- and
cafe-lined lake that makes for such delightful strolls here.
But directly behind Pamvotis I could see the first steep, snow-covered folds
of the Pindus rising skywards. In the late 18th century the protection
offered by these peaks allowed Ali Pasha, the Albanian-born 'Lion of
Ioannina', to rebel against Greece's Turkish overlords and carve out an
independent mountain fiefdom.
Ali Pasha may have been celebrated by Lord Byron, the champion of Greek
independence, but he was an unsavoury character, as harsh as the land he
ruled. He discouraged opponents by breaking their bones with sledge-hammers
in public executions. His omnivorous sexual appetite was notorious - when
his son's mistress rejected his advances he had her and 17 companions bound
together, weighted and thrown into Lake Pamvotis. Not even Lord Byron was
safe. On meeting the poet, Ali Pasha took a particular fancy to him, and, so
it is reported, became obsessed with his small and dainty ears.
Like many tyrants, though, Ali Pasha came to a sticky end. Not far from the
Frourio, his walled and minaret-topped citadel on the shores of the lake,
you can today visit an island monastery where he finally got his
come-uppance. Trapped by Turkish assassins on an upper storey, he was shot
in the underside from the room below. The ragged bullet holes are still in
the monastery's wooden floorboards to prove it.
Epirus's essence, though, is to be found not in its towns, but high up in
the valleys and villages of the Pindus. Just half-an-hour north of Ioannina
I found myself driving up rocky limestone defiles and over deep river gorges
in country so rough and broken that even herds of goats seemed to find it
tough going.
It is wild, surprisingly beautiful, and not wholly unpopulated. In the 46
villages of the Zagori, as this, the most attractive area of the Pindus is
known, you will find some of the most impressive village architecture in all
Greece.
I came into the village of Monodhendhri almost without seeing it. Like all
the villages here, it is nearly invisible, a natural extension of the world
that surrounds it. From top to bottom, from roof to lintel, floor tile to
terrace wall, church tower to cobbled pathway, Monodhendhri is built of the
grey slate mountainside on which it sits.
Just getting into the village was difficult enough; it is enclosed by
semi-fortified walls and laced by a labyrinth of narrow stone pathways that
time and again failed to take me where I wanted to go. Once at my
destination, a small inn in the upper village, I found it impossible to get
a meal - the place was packed solid.
It was still months from the summer tourist season. Was Monodhendhri always
as crowded, I asked Georgi, the young man who helps his parents run their
small hotel. Not at all, he replied. This was a crowd of Greek city-dwellers
who had returned for the holiday to visit the few relatives and friends who
remain faithful to the mountain way of life.
Later, when the family parties had thinned out, I sat down to a dinner of
Easter lamb, a great chunk of ribs cut from an entire animal turning on a
spit outside. Over a mountainously full plate I learned that people - not
too many, but too few - have always been a problem in the Pindus.
Prosperous under Ali Pasha, Epirus in the 19th century became an unsettled
border territory, disputed by Albania and relinquished by the Turks only in
1913. In Nazi-occupied Greece the mountain terrain of the Pindus provided an
ideal base for Greek resistance fighters, as it did for communist partisans
in the savage civil war that followed. In each case vicious reprisals by the
authorities led to the abandonment of entire villages. Many villagers left
to start new lives elsewhere, never to return to their harsh and
unproductive land.
Only in the last decade has the discovery of the Pindus' natural beauty by
outsiders renewed its prospects once again. Just yards from Monodhendhri's
stone-colonnaded church begins a path that winds steeply downwards for more
than an hour. At the bottom begins a spectacular trek through the Vikos
Gorge, Greece's answer the Grand Canyon.
Each summer the gorge attracts growing numbers of trekkers. Invigorated by
sparkling mountain air and brilliant sunshine, who would not be tempted? I
was.
But at Easter, with snow-melt flooding the river on the gorge floor, I had
to content myself with other, not-so-strenuous pleasures: giddy views over
the gorge's sheer, 3000-ft walls; walks through high pastures beginning to
bloom with spring flowers; picnics of feta, wine and fat olives by the side
of clear green mountain streams; tramps through stone villages each as
attractive as the last. It may not have been as exciting as the eight-hour
walk through the gorge, but it was far more exciting than the prospect of
the eight-hour drive out of the Pindus and back across the plains to that
other Greece.
Nicholas Woodsworth flew to Greece with British Airways, which has a
Eurobudget fare, London-Athens return, of Pounds 524 (20 per cent
cancellation charge) and Pex fares starting at Pounds 278 return.
For those planning either trekking or touring holidays in Zagoria and the
Pindus, a car is a great aid; public transportation between towns and
mountain villages is rare. Also useful would be a smattering of basic Greek;
although B &amp; B-style accommodation is becoming widely available, few people
in these valleys speak other languages.
There are dozens of wholly unspoiled walking routes in the Pindus range.
Organised walks through the Vikos Gorge and elsewhere can be arranged
through Robinson Travel, Ogdhois Merarhias 10, Ioannina, tel: 0651-29-402.
Information about the Epirus can be obtained in the UK from the National
Tourist Organisation of Greece, 195 Regent St, London SW1, tel:

FT  03 JUL 93 / Travel: Colombia's more acceptable face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK HASLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH A grunt of pain, the fakir lay back on the bed of rusty nails. On his
chest, four be-suited businessmen balanced precariously, with nervous
smiles. It was lunchtime in the business district of Bogota, and the small
crowd of secretaries and clerks applauded and dropped coins into the hat
passed around by a ragged boy.
When the fakir got stiffly to his feet, his back was livid with the
impressions of nails; here and there, I could see a trickle of dried blood.
Colombia is always full of surprises. In Bogota, the morning rush hour
resembles that of a prosperous city in northern Spain. Grey-suited workers
walk purposefully to their offices among tower blocks in the downtown area.
Yet, at midday, when the street corner magicians, fakirs and quack medicine
peddlers set up shop, the mixture of Indian faces and dress quickly dispels
any illusions of a European city.
Not far from the teeming commercial centre, tucked under one of the
mountains that tower over Bogota, lies the Quinta de Bolivar. The lovely
country house, with rooms opening on to a verandah shaded with
bougainvillaea, was donated by grateful citizens to Simon Bolivar, who
finally freed Latin America from the Spanish empire.
Renowned for his ability to cover miles on horseback over Colombia's
tortuous terrain to harass the Spanish, Bolivar was known as Iron Arse by
his admiring supporters. Within 15 years, he had routed the Imperial armies,
and in 1820 created the Gran Colombia comprising Ecuador, Venezuela and
Colombia. But internal rivalries ended Bolivar's dream, and the grand
alliance fell apart a few years later. Bolivar died, broken-hearted, in
1830.
Travel anywhere in the country and it is easy to understand why he was held
in such awe. At an altitude of 2,600 metres (8,515 ft), Bogota is one of the
highest capitals in the world. Roads leading from the city wind over
spectacular passes of the Cordillera Central.
I left early one morning in an ancient and cossetted 1962 Chrysler. The
driver, Antonio, a trim man in his late 60s, had shown me the engine of the
car with pride before we set off. Highly polished, a crucifix presided over
the spotless compartment where the six-cylinder motor ticked silently. 'They
made these cars too well,' he said, proudly, flicking a duster over the
chromed manifold.
Our destination was the Monasterio de la Candeleria, an Augustinian seminary
in the Andes. We climbed past labouring trucks crowded with Indians on their
way to market, and then descended through the broad pastures of several rich
haciendas to Villa de Leyva.
A pretty village of low white-walled houses tiled in red, it was a favourite
resting place for Bolivar to escape from the sombre climate and political
intriguing of Bogota. With a balmy, year-round temperature of 18'C (65'F),
it is still a popular weekend resort for wealthier Bogotanos.
The seminary lay tucked in the mountains, 90 minutes' drive across a
semi-desert. The monks were at lunch, the only cafe closed, but Antonio
provided refreshment. At the touch of a button, two tiny nozzles under the
dashboard dispensed red wine or aguardiente, a local anisette made from
coconut.
We sipped and waited for the bell to ring announcing that the monastery was
open. Finally, a young monk gestured us through the large, arched gateway.
The cloisters were lined with flowering vines; parrots and parakeets dozed
on the branches of orange trees on the wide central patio. Small groups of
seminarists chatted and laughed on their way back to class, passing under
stern oil portraits of their predecessors.
We were shown the chapel, with an early and very bloody Christ on the cross,
and then taken to a museum where the bizarre artifacts ranged from Indian
arrows from the Amazon to the first jukebox to play in the high Cordillera.
As we left, our guide told us he would soon be leaving the mountain calm of
the seminary for one of the toughest slums of Bogota.
Five hundred miles to the north of the capital, and in complete contrast to
the arid plateau of the Central Cordillera, lies Cartagena, on the country's
Caribbean coast. For 300 years, it was the only port for the entire
continent, and the walled city was fortified heavily after repeated raids by
the English in the 16th century.
Still ringed with high, buttressed defences, the narrow streets offer
tantalising glimpses of cool patios with fountains playing. Churches and
green plazas give way to unexpected vistas of the sea through gates in the
city walls.
The Cartagenos are a cheerful and colourful people, mixed descendants of the
Spanish, local Indians and African slaves. Their friendliness and the
relaxed atmosphere of the town make it a popular holiday destination for
Colombians from other major cities, particularly Medellin, where the police
clamp-down on the drug cartel has put the town under virtual curfew.
During lunch at a beach-side restaurant, the thud of a distant explosion
sent a frisson of concern through the diners and I heard the phrase 'car
bomb.' But a waiter reported that a transformer had short-circuited on a
nearby electricity pylon.
That night, my last in Colombia, I took a chiva tour from my hotel. The
chiva, an open single-deck bus, was packed with Latin American tourists. At
the back, three musicians played musica campesino, the forerunner of salsa,
at high volume on a trumpet, accordion and drum.
Until 3 am, we toured the nightclubs of Cartagena, drinking rum and dancing
to salsa and merengue. We had started the evening as total strangers; by the
end, I had addresses and invitations to visit Brazil, Argentina and Chile,
and had learnt a few new dance steps. As the chiva wove back through the
warm, sleeping streets, night watchmen would rise and dance a few steps
until we were out of earshot.
I took the last sip from my rum bottle and reflected that the major problem
with Colombia was its size. Ten days had not been enough. I knew I would
return soon to visit more of this remarkable country.
Nick Haslam flew to Bogota c/o American Airlines.  Generally, return
flights, London-Bogota, start at Pounds 442, except in high summer when they
are dearer. His holiday was organised by Passage to South America, 41 North
End Road, London W14 8SZ (tel.  071-602 9889).
A two-week Colombian holiday - two cities, one beach resort, including
internal flights, hotels and breakfast - would cost from around Pounds
1,000, says the company.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Travel: Hanging on to your holiday - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE been to only two creditors' meetings of failed travel companies, but
I am starting to get the hang of it. At the top table are the liquidator and
his solicitor, dressed in black. Between them sits the managing director of
the failed concern - pale, fidgeting and alert to the possibility that a jug
of water may be poured over his head, as happened at the first creditors'
meeting I attended.
The venue is dingy, as the liquidators do not want to be seen to be spending
too much money. I was there as a reporter. You do not want to be there as a
creditor. You are unlikely to get either your money back or your holiday.
There are three groups of creditors in attendance. There are the trade
creditors - hotel keepers, coach owners, and so on - who know they are
unlikely to recover anything. There are accountants, representing some trade
creditors and the odd well-connected traveller, who also know that there
will be little money, but who enjoy tormenting the managing director with
inquiries about the Italian villa that was previously on the company's
books.
Finally, there is you, the travelling public, who have lost both your money
and your holiday. The travellers fidget while the liquidator reports on the
company's meagre realisable assets. They listen while the accountants probe
the matter of the Italian villa. Finally, one of the travellers explodes,
finger shaking at the managing director: 'You should be locked up]'
So . . . how to avoid these gatherings?
In theory, no one should ever lose money on a package holiday again. At the
beginning of the year, an EC directive came into force, obliging all package
travel companies to ensure that customers' money can be returned in the
event of corporate collapse.
In the UK, the directive has already proved useless. Firstly, there is no
way of ensuring compliance. Trading standards officers are meant to keep an
eye on companies, but they have neither the time nor the experience.
Secondly, no one knows the legal definition of a package holiday. One
company which collapsed recently was told by the Department of Trade and
Industry that it was not a package holiday company, and did not have to
comply with the directive, because it allowed customers to choose their own
ferry crossings. As there were customers who had paid an inclusive price for
their car, ferry crossing, villa and linen, the DTI's advice was difficult
to understand.
There are three ways of ensuring you do not lose your money:
1) If you are travelling by air, ask for your operator's Air Travel
Organiser's Licence (Atol). Then telephone the Civil Aviation Authority
(071-832-5620) to check it is still in order. If an Atol holder collapses,
the CAA will arrange your refund.
2) If you are travelling by road and sea, make sure your operator is a
member of the Association of British Travel Agents (0891-202-520) or the
Association of Independent Tour Operators (081-744-9280). It is important to
check that the operator is a member. Having a travel agent who is an Abta
member might not be enough.
3) Pay by credit card. Under the Consumer Credit Act, you could be entitled
to your money back if the company collapses. If you have a charge card,
debit card or gold card, check that you are protected.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Travel: A little hacienda that I know . . . - Michael
Thompson-Noel has been sampling a mix of top-class and good value hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I SEEM TO have whizzed through a few hotels lately
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
some grand, some not, but each of them proof of the diversity and rapidity
of evolution in the international hotel business.
Take the Hacienda de San Rafael in western Andalucia, Spain. It is 30
minutes from Seville, Jerez or Arcos and 75 minutes from Ronda. The hacienda
is owned and run by Kuky and Tim Reid and is entirely surrounded, at this
time of year, by fields of sunflowers stretching to the horizon - a
magnificent spot. In turn, Hacienda de San Rafael is one of the most
memorable small hotels you may ever encounter, not only for its location but
for its food and atmosphere.
The building dates back more than 150 years. Until 20 years ago the hacienda
was a molino, used for producing olive oil. It has been restored with
enormous care. At present there are seven bedrooms with bathrooms, plus two
additional bedrooms for family use.
There is a large living room and dining room located on either side of the
entrance to the rose-, jasmine- and bougainvillaea-strewn courtyard, off
which four of the bedrooms, duplex-designed and with en-suite bathrooms, are
positioned. There is a swimming pool, gardens and a paddle-tennis court. The
food is exceptional and Kuky Reid possibly the nicest woman in Europe.
The current room-and-breakfast rate at Hacienda de San Rafael is Pounds 70
per night. Lunch or dinner: Pounds 22. The hacienda can be booked
exclusively for a group of 10-14. Until October, a group booking costs
Pounds 1,080 per day plus 10 per cent service charge. In winter: Pounds 620
plus 10 per cent.
You can book for the Hacienda de San Rafael through TRI Hotel Marketing in
London. Alternatively, you can use Kirker Travel, a vigorous and expert
travel organiser that specialises in upmarket European short-break holidays
in Spain (primarily Madrid, Barcelona and Seville, but also including hotel
itineraries throughout Granada and Cordoba), Portugal, Amsterdam, Paris and
Italy. It also handles rail holidays.
Kirker's current charge for three nights at the hacienda on a half-board
basis, including car hire and flights from London, is Pounds 569 per person.
Extra nights: Pounds 109. Or you could have three nights at the hacienda
(half board) and three (B&amp;B) at the immaculate Casa de Carmona, 20 minutes
from the centre of Seville, for Pounds 845 per person.
Another excellent establishment is Warsaw's Hotel Bristol. It first opened
its doors in 1901, with concert pianist and Polish statesman Ignacy
Paderewski as one of its biggest shareholders. It became a Warsaw landmark.
Under the communists the Bristol was closed 12 years ago, but has now been
re-established as a joint venture between Forte Hotels and Poland's Orbis.
And it is absolutely smashing - stylish, comfortable, discreet and immensely
well-run. The service is so professional that there were times when I
imagined I was in some hot-shot hostelry in Rome, Sydney or Beverly Hills,
the sort of place that charges Dollars 1,250 a night just for looking at
you.
The Hotel Bristol has 163 bedrooms and 43 suites, two superb restaurants
(one Polish, one Italian), the best hotel cafe I have ever sat in and an
indoor swimming pool. Warsaw is more problematic: dull and dusty and (as
yet) uninteresting. I went on a coach tour to Chopin's birthplace. It cost
Pounds 30, which was absurdly expensive, though we were given a Chopin
recital by a Warsaw pianist, Marta Gozdecka, that calmed and charmed us. And
on Saturday night I found my way to the ballet at the Warsaw opera house
which - for Giselle - was surprisingly enjoyable. The best seats cost Pounds
5.
You will find information on the Hotel Bristol in the Forte International
brochure, covering Forte hotels in more than 50 places in Europe, the US,
Caribbean and Middle East. The guide price for the Hotel Bristol quoted
recently was Pounds 61 or Dollars 90 per person per night, including
breakfast, for two people sharing (singles: Pounds 95/Dollars 140), though
room rates are subject to currency adjustment. Offers in the brochure
include extra-value longer stays, such as seven nights for the price of six.
In many cases children stay free of charge when sharing a room with their
parents.
Vastly different is the newly-opened, 150-apartment Corfu Plaza Hotel near
Agios Georgios beach in south-western Corfu, the latest addition to Corfu's
huge package holiday industry and owned by the local Rizos family. I doubt
that FT readers will be fighting to get into the Corfu Plaza - it is not
their scene at all - though they might want to send irksome teenagers there
for a cheerful introduction to a delightful island.
I was more taken with two other Rizos hotels in Corfu. Like the Corfu Plaza,
they are to be found in the Thomson Summer Sun brochure - the Hotel
Yaliscari Palace at Pelekas and, even more so, the Hotel Aghios Gordios at
Aghios Gordios. The Thomson brochure is a 508-page encyclopaedia of
feel-good writing of the highest class. Of the Hotel Aghios Gordios, it
says: 'Couples of all ages will love the romantic setting, peace and
tranquillity amid breathtaking scenery.'
I am not sure about peace and tranquillity. When I was there the joint was
jumping. But the customers looked respectable. The general manager is a
beauty. The location is spectacular. And the view westward over the Ionian
Sea is without doubt . . . romantic. Two people could have a seven-night
(half board) Thomson package holiday at the Aghios Gordios in late September
or October for about Pounds 680, which is probably good value.
Finally, I spent a weekend recently in a Novotel in the centre of Lille, in
northern France. Lille was an eye-opener - excellent shops and restaurants,
plenty to see and do - and I am a fan of Novotels anyway, so that was nice.
There are 270 worldwide.
Generally, corporate manifestos are risible. But Novotels deliver the goods.
There are said to be eight fundamentals underlying the Novotel approach to
hospitality - a spacious 24 sq metre room; children under 16 sharing their
parents' room accommodated free; swimming pools and gardens; special weekend
leisure packages, especially at Evasion and Thalassa hotels; meals served
from 6am to midnight; business services; parking facilities at each hotel,
and convenient locations. In addition, rates are extremely competitive.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Sport: Novotna's day on court - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS afternoon's 100th Ladies Singles final at Wimbledon could mark the
beginning of a new era in women's tennis. If the 24-year-old Czech, Jana
Novotna, seeded No 8, plays as well today as she did on Thursday to beat the
nine-times champion Martina Navratilova 6-4 6-4, then she will beat the
reigning champion, Steffi Graf. But will she be allowed to?
This match is as fascinating as the one forecast by the seeding committee,
Graf (1) v Navratilova (2), for Novotna is the logical successor to
Navratilova as apostle of the serve and volley game. Like Martina, Jana was
born in Czechoslovakia and for the past three and a half years has been
coached by Martina's successor as that nation's No 1 player, Hana
Mandlikova.
Ever since I first saw Novotna in 1986 when she won the US Open junior
doubles I knew that she had the potential for greatness. Already the fluent,
well-timed ground strokes (albeit with too large a swing in those days) were
well grooved, the keenness to advance to the net was apparent, the ability
to move from low volleys to deep overheads with the fast, natural court
coverage of a born athlete all marked her as one to watch.
Still lacking was the self belief of a true champion. Young Jana was a shy,
sensitive person, almost apologetic for the glorious winners she hit. Would
this teenager who bounced around the court with the playful grace of a lion
cub grow in to a fierce lioness capable of making a kill?
Jana's rose steadily but unsensationally through the rankings, from 172 in
1986 to 49 in 1987, 11 in 1989 and 7 two years later. Yet still on the great
occasions her belief died. There were two failures in 1991 that left a
question mark over her. At the Australian Open she scored a magnificent 5-7
6-4 8-6 quarter-final victory over Graf but collapsed in the final against
Monica Seles after taking the opening set. At the French Open, Jana was
thrashing Gabriela Sabatini with some glorious all-court tennis. However,
after letting two match points slip in the second set and then losing the
tie-break, she again collapsed and lost the last set 6-0.
Suddenly, here at Wimbledon, it has all come together. Three straight sets
wins over inferior clay-court opposition were the prelude to a fine win in
three sets against another with huge potential - Miriam Oremans of the
Netherlands. There followed a 6-4 6-3 victory over Sabatini, which seemed to
exorcise the demon of self-doubt.
Certainly belief was still strong in the semi-final against Navratilova. The
serve, slightly remodelled with less knee bend and a faster throwing action,
was deadly. Six aces brought her tally for the tournament to 28 and many
more deep penetrating deliveries paved the way for firm winning volleys.
But it was Jana's tactical acumen that most impressed. Jana, encouraged by
urgent nods of approval from Mandlikova in the players' box, stuck to her
plan. Her blocked returns of serve, taken on the rise and projected down the
lines past the advancing server, made every Navratilova service game a
gamble. Three times in all Novotna broke the former champion who was made to
look a yard slower than usual.
Before the match Mandlikova had told me: 'Jana is now mature enough to win.
She may have lost to Martina seven times, but she is not afraid to win
today.'
Jana herself said afterwards: 'I came into the match with a little
disadvantage. Martina has won the tournament nine times. She feels she owns
the Centre Court. I was the one who didn't play one match there . . . I had
to overcome so many things. So I just said, don't worry about it. The court
is the same like anywhere else so just play the ball. That's exactly what I
did. I just think I've done it so well and played just the perfect match.'
Jana was not boasting, simply being honest. She was right. She did play the
perfect match. Hear Navratilova: 'That was the best she ever played. If she
plays like that she can definitely win the final. There's no question about
that.'
No question? Well, Graf will have something to say about that as she she
seeks to add to her four titles from five finals in the last six years. Now
fully restored in spirit after the family traumas of 1990, the defending
champion is playing as well as ever, in spite of a still suspect right
ankle. Once she had wiped out a 1-4 deficit against Conchita Martinez,
Graf's powerful serve and forehand, allied to her heavily sliced backhand
and some enterprising volleys carried her to a comfortable 7-6 6-3 victory.
Graf will be playing in her 20th Grand Slam final today, Novotna in her
second. The champion will be aiming for a 13th success, her challenger for a
first. In spite of her greater experience, Graf is aware of the danger.
'She's got the talent, she's got the game. I will have to have a very solid
serve and I have to work on my return which hasn't been particularly good
today.'
This is the 20th meeting between the two best athletes in the game. Graf has
lost only three. She won their only contest on grass - at Wimbledon in 1987,
but six of their last seven have gone the distance.
All the ingredients are there for a classic battle. The world's second best
baseliner against the best serve-volleyer in women's tennis; experienced
champion against talented tyro; German against Czech. Above all, though, it
will be a battle of the mind. Graf is prone to moments when her forehand
goes haywire; Novotna must prove that the solid belief she displayed against
Navratilova will not melt when the game's greatest prize is at stake. It
should be a fascinating afternoon.
The men's final tomorrow is, appropriately on July 4, an all-American
affair. It brings together the two men who head the world rankings, Pete
Sampras (1) and Jim Courier (2). Sampras served magnificently yesterday to
beat the three-time champion Boris Becker 7-6 6-4 6-4. The match turned on
one volley Becker missed in the first set tie-break. His confidence broken,
Becker's serve disintegrated. Three double faults of the 12 he served cost
him the third game of the second set and his failure to break back with
Sampras at 5-4, 15-40 virtually cost him the match.
Courier, demoted behind Sweden's Stefan Edberg in the seedings, passed his
verdict on that slight in the finest way possible. Once he had got used to
the idea that Edberg's second serve is no longer a fearsome weapons, the
issue was never in doubt. The realisation seemed to dawn on him midway
through the second set. Trailing by one set and a break of serve in the
second, Courier struck back with the pounding returns and passes that are
his trademark.
The third was all Courier as the Swede's confidence evaporated. Edberg was
no longer prepared to follow all his second serves to the net. After just
over two hours Courier was ahead by two sets to one. Eight games later
man. Courier's 4-6 6-4 6-2 6-4 success on a surface which was supposed to be
alien to him was a triumph of spirit over technique. If Sampras's suspect
shoulder holds up I expect to see him add a first Wimbledon title to the
only other Grand Slam title he holds - the 1990 US Open.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Sport: The voice of point blank opinion - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIFE in Cricket is a well titled book, touching on every aspect of Trevor
Bailey's cricketing childhood and years at Cambridge University, no fewer
than 21 years of playing and administering for Essex, a decade of trenchant
resistance for England in the 1950s and 1960s, then since 1966 his writing
in The Observer and Financial Times, his cricket books, work for public
relations companies and, above all, his Test Match commentaries on the
radio.
I am one of many people, including some not particularly interested in
cricket, who like and admire Bailey on the radio, where he is the voice of
point blank opinion clearly expressed. One of this book's themes is Bailey's
confident pursuit of his own line and it was as lucky for England as it was
unlucky for spectators that the obvious line for him to take as a player was
usually a refusal to be out.
He became a model of steady bowling and defiant batting that drove opposing
teams to distraction and sent some fans to sleep. However, his innings of
71, in partnership with Willie Watson's 109, to save England from the
ferocious bowling of Australia's Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller in the second
innings of the 1953 Lords Test instantly became a symbol of national pride.
One of the things this book does well is conjure up the atmosphere of the
1950s. Accurate, calm and dogged, Bailey and his fellow saviours go from one
work of rescue, if not triumph, to the next in 1950s Tests.
The morning after the 1953 Lords Test, Neville Cardus's headline in The
Manchester Guardian 'Miracle of Faith at Lords' nicely complements the
author's description of national tension as evening fell on the fifth day,
offices in north London emptied and Bailey stayed at the crease, earning
himself his lifelong nicknames 'The Boil' and 'The Barnacle'.
It is not exciting reading but if you want to know the details of Bailey's
cricketing life, including many he does not include in his early
autobiography, Playing to Win, it is interesting. If you want to know about
his personal or emotional life, you are wasting your time. It is a
cricketing biography and it is exhaustive.
There is only one set of pictures, which is a pity. Surely there could have
been a few more of the young Bailey, blazered and Brylcreemed, oozing
self-assurance. Perhaps too there could have been a little more about the
problems.
The vexed question of amateur / professional relations is touched on
repeatedly, in the light of Bailey's amateur status and Len Hutton's
position as England's first professional captain, but not fully examined.
Bailey's unsuccessful captaincy of Essex 1961-66, his failure to win the
captaincy of England when Hutton retired and the unhappy departure from
English cricket of his protege Barry Knight are among the problems that get
away lightly.
The book is a bit bland, sometimes a bit dull. But Jack Bailey has written
it clearly and, like his namesake's batting, it is well worth having.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Sport: Hand of God for troubled players - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN COURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMER can be cruel for footballers. While league champions and cup victors
are still basking in the glory of their procession to the town hall in
open-topped buses, it is the time when relegated clubs resign themselves to
life in a lower league.
It is also when players' contracts run out. Many teenagers on trial are told
by their clubs that they have not made the professional grade. And
old-timers are eased out with a free transfer - plus, if they are fortunate,
the proceeds of a decent testimonial match.
So who is there to help players when the final whistle blows? Increasingly,
football club chaplains are providing a shoulder to lean on. There are
around 40 chaplains in the Premier League and the Barclay Football League.
There is even an organisation to promote the spread of sports chaplaincies,
called Sports Chaplaincy Offering Resources and Encouragement or Score for
short. It is run by John Boyers, formerly chaplain to Watford FC, and
chaplain to current league champions Manchester United, since last November.
Although Boyers is a Baptist minister Score is inter denominational. It has
high-profile backing, with England team manager, Graham Taylor, and the BBC
soccer commentator, John Motson, on the board of reference. Ken Merrett,
secretary of Manchester United, is also on the board. Merrett also invited
Boyers to come north to be his team's chaplain.
Boyers, whose position is honorary, spends Monday at United's training
ground. He likes to have lunch with the players, although he is at pains to
point out that his 'parish' is the whole staff - not just the team members.
'My main job is to be a counsellor, and be a listening ear. The chaplain is
there to help people - the manager is there to bring success.'
About 50 league notches below mighty United is second division Fulham. For
the past three seasons, Gary Piper, the vicar of St Matthew's, Fulham, has
been the chaplain to the club.
Piper, a former teacher, is a life-long fan of Fulham. He helped run the
junior supporters' club before offering his services as chaplain - the then
manager, Alan Dicks, accepted.
Fulham's assistant manager, Ray Lewington, admits the club does little for
players whose stay at Craven Cottage ends. For that, Fulham relies mainly on
retraining schemes provided by the Professional Footballers' Association,
although Fulham will ring round other clubs to see if there are any takers
for their discarded players.
Piper tries to provide moral support. 'Sooner or later a player comes to the
end of the line,' he says. 'A lot of juniors guess beforehand that they are
not going to be signed on. It's a heart-breaking thing. Since primary school
they have dreamed of being a footballer. I have been there for them, sitting
and listening and sometimes drying the tears. The essence is saying: 'You
matter as a person'.'
Isn't that approach at odds with the macho world of the changing-room? Piper
admits that he wonders if he has done anything useful. 'Sometimes I feel I'm
standing round like a spare part. The hardest thing was introducing myself
to the players. I felt I was an outsider. There's still a bit of that, but
most of them are very friendly.'
Piper has moved from outsider to insider. He has taken part in the club's
phone line for fans. His greatest honour - apart from donning a Fulham shirt
and playing at the ground for the staff team - was being asked to pay
tribute at Craven Cottage to Bobby Moore, after the former England captain
and Fulham player died in February.
Lewington says: 'With Gary, there's always someone there for the players to
talk to. He's the type who will sit down and listen. Coaches and managers
are not the people to do it. There's a block between us and players -
sometimes they need a neutral. Gary has bridged the gap really well.'
Piper usually spends Thursday morning at the club, for the training session,
as well as going to the first or reserve team games on Saturday. Thursdays
are better for seeing the players, because there is no match-day pressure.
The players can discuss problems with him in confidence. 'They know it isn't
going to get back to the manager or the directors' he says.
He keeps an eye out for players who have been dropped from the side, or are
out for months through injury. News is passed down the chaplains' grapevine
and Piper has been to see players in hospital who have come to London from
other parts of the country for an operation.
In the 1992-93 season Fulham finished midway down the table. When people
hear that the team has a chaplain says Piper they tease that the club should
be doing better. But how does he see his role? 'I'm there because I'm a
Christian, but not to thrust religion down the players' throats. I say to
them that I am quite prepared to talk about my faith, but I let them bring
the subject up - and some have talked to me about it.'
Piper, like Boyers, is unpaid. British soccer is still very different from
American Football. For professional and college teams in the US services and
prayer meetings are regular accompaniments to games.
Piper says: 'Players for the San Francisco 49ers regularly go to church.
They were surprised that it doesn't happen here. I think it is very
difficult for players here who are Christians. But there are a number who
are not frightened to say they are. They are becoming more vocal.'
None of the Fulham players are regular churchgoers, as far as he knows.
Piper does not see the players prior to the kick-off on Saturday. 'The
changing-room is absolutely sacrosanct before a game, except for the manager
and coach,' he said. 'I never go there.'

FT  03 JUL 93 / Motoring: A bigger embrace for diesels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE diesel cars are bought in France than anywhere else. They account for
nearly 50 per cent of new registrations. More diesel is now sold at filling
stations than petrol.
Britain's diesel car market is the world's fastest-growing although still
well short of France. Even so, one car in five sold in Britain this year is
likely to be a diesel.
As recently as the mid-1980s, though, they were comparative rarities. Most
British motorists still thought of them as noisy and gutless oddities run by
economy freaks.
No company has done more to change the British view of diesel cars than PSA
(Peugeot-Citroen). Its Peugeot 205 and 405 and Citroen BX and ZX have for
years been consistent best-sellers in the UK. Now, the new Peugeot 306
(made, like the 405, at Ryton, Coventry) and, in a few weeks, the new
Citroen Xantia, will boost diesel sales higher still.
The Peugeot 306 rides and handles exceptionally well (like the Citroen ZX,
with which it shares mechanical bits and pieces). Since its UK launch in the
spring, it has been sold only with petrol engines but, last week, I tried
its left-hand drive, 1.9-litre 306 diesels in France. The non-turbo, 70 hp
version impressed me but I was enchanted by the whispering, 92 hp,
turbo-charged and inter-cooled model.
It drove with a vigour that would have done credit to a petrol-engined car
and was so refined that I simply forgot (as one does with BMW's six-cylinder
turbo-diesels, newly-arrived in Britain) that it was a diesel at all. It
pulled so strongly from 2,000 rpm upwards that it felt as much a 'one-gear'
car as a massive American V8. (Yes, there are still a few with manual
boxes).
Prices of 306 turbo-diesels start at Pounds 11,475 and non-turbo models,
with less luxurious trim, from Pounds 9,345.
Coming to Britain in the autumn is a 1.8-litre, petrol-engined automatic. It
has the same smooth-changing, ZF transmission as the 405 and is likely to
cost about Pounds 750 more than the equivalent manual-gearbox 306. Other
306s in the pipeline include a sporty two-litre, three-door due late in the
autumn and, eventually, cabriolets.
Sadly, Peugeot has no plans to market a 306 diesel with automatic
transmission although Citroen offers a two-pedal ZX diesel without a
turbo-charger at Pounds 11,595. An automatic turbo-diesel Peugeot 306 - or,
for that matter, Citroen ZX - could be a delightful and easy-to-drive car,
very lively yet still capable of 40 mpg-plus (7.06 l/100 km) economy. But
the combined extra cost of turbo-charging and automatic transmission -
roughly Pounds 1,300 - might price it out of the market.
Automatic transmission has not caught on as widely on mainland Europe as it
has in the UK. About 10 per cent of all new cars in Britain and 20 per cent
in Switzerland are automatics, but only 2 per cent in France and Italy.
It is all to do with the Latin temperament and machismo. Latins love
shifting gear. Indeed, Italians are said to feel that two-pedal cars are
only for the handicapped or people who hate driving. 'They just don't
realise our automatics are so enjoyable,' mourned a man from Peugeot.
FILLING a car gives many people the same feeling as paying for a supermarket
trolley full of groceries. How on earth could it possibly cost so much? So,
it might come as a surprise to learn that British pump prices for petrol are
among Europe's lowest.
According to the Automobile Association, UK motorists in mid-June paid an
average 50.61p a litre for unleaded. Leaded super was 54.37p and diesel
50.14p (although all prices were about 3.5p a litre lower at supermarkets).
Compare Britain's 50.61p for unleaded with 74.29p in Norway, 71.74p
(Sweden), 70.43 (Italy) and 67.53p (Holland). It should make you feel
better.
Britain's average 50.14p diesel is fairly expensive, though. Diesel is
cheaper everywhere except Denmark and Sweden, Italy (once renowned for cheap
diesel but where it now costs 56.43p) and Switzerland (where it has always
cost more than petrol and is now 57.41p).
French diesel at 44.07p a litre (say, Pounds 2 a gallon) compares with
unleaded petrol (61.6p a litre or Pounds 2.80 a gallon) and leaded premium
(65.68p or almost Pounds 3 a gallon). You can see why the French prefer
diesels to petrol cars and avoid cars that are heavy drinkers.
Western Europe's cheapest petrol is in Luxembourg: 43.76p a litre unleaded
and 51.09p leaded. Diesel is also a good buy in Luxembourg at 37.43p, but is
cheaper in Norway at 31.65p, much less than half the price of unleaded
petrol.
Greece favours diesel car drivers (29.12p a litre against 58.54p for
unleaded petrol, 61.89p for leaded) but the best European country in which
to tank-up with any fuel has to be Turkey. Diesel at 24.79p a litre is half
the British price, while Turkish leaded premium (34.92p) is even cheaper
than unleaded (39.22p).
If you are thinking of driving a newish car with a catalyser to eastern
Europe, the AA warns that unleaded pumps are few and far between in
Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovakian republics, Hungary, Poland and Romania. It
would be wise to carry a spare can or two of unleaded in the boot.
Make sure, though, that the containers are empty until you are over the
Channel. Only the contents of a car's tank are allowed by the ferry
operators.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Eastern inspiration - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN PHILIP Harris, proprietor of the Bahn Thai restaurant in Frith Street,
London W1 (tel: 071-437-8504), sought to mark its reopening after a major
refit he looked for inspiration from the far east and the south west.
From the east came a 900-year-old statuette of Buddha, incense, candles,
orchid and a Thai goblet filled with holy water with which to annoint the
restaurant's staff. From the south west - the Thai temple, Wimbledon - came
nine Buddhist priests who prayed for the restaurant's well being and blessed
the staff. Then to lunch: two different Thai curries, spiced crispy fried
mackerel, a salad of minced pork and pigskin with whole red chillis, mint
and peanuts, raw vegetables and glutinous rice washed down with fresh orange
juice and tea.
The restaurant is now restricted to the upper floor. On the ground floor
Bahn Thai now serves what can only be described as Thai tapas for those
wanting a quick snack. Dishes include: Thai-style fried dry salt beef
(Pounds 6.45), stuffed chicken wings with a plum sauce (Pounds 4.65) and
spicy Thai pork sausages (Pounds 4.80).
There will be a festival of Thai Food and Culture in the grounds of the Thai
Temple, 14 Calonne Road, off Wimbledon Parkside, London SW19, on Sunday July
18, 10.30am-7pm.
Leith's will be running a five-month Credential Course, starting next
January, designed for those looking for a change of career, for women
returning to work after having children and for those who who may be seeking
a professional catering career but who do not need to start with basics.
Cost: Pounds 5,125 per person. (Details: 071-229-0177).
For those touring England this summer there are some good value breaks on
offer from hotels with distinctive restaurants. At Buckland-Tout-Saints
Hotel, Kingsbridge, on the south coast of Devon (0548-853055), a two-night
break including dinner, bed and breakfast is Pounds 75 per person. Further
north in Skipton, Yorkshire, near Bolton Abbey, the same deal is available
for Pounds 67.50 per person at the Devonshire Country House Hotel
(0756-710441).
In the New Forest, Hampshire, one of the original country house hotels,
Chewton Glen, is offering a 'green shoots package' - Pounds 99 per person
for dinner, bed and breakfast. Sunday-Thursday nights only (0425-275341).
A survey of childrens' cooking skills in this country revealed depressing
results - one in two interviewed could not even boil an egg. And, with
domestic science disappearing from the curriculum in many schools, this
trend is likely to get worse. Last week the House of Commons saw the launch
of 'Get Cooking]' a project aimed at reversing the trend. An information
pack giving advice and recipes aimed at teaching children the foundations of
wholesome cooking is available, price Pounds 12.50 plus 1.50 p&amp;p, from Get
Cooking], National Food Alliance, 5-11 Worship Street, London EC2A 2BH.
In Giles MacDonogh's article last week on Belgo, 72 Chalk Farm Road, London
N1, the restaurant number was given incorrectly. It should be 071-267-0718.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Survivors of Teutonic hygiene - Common Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN and Austrian markets are frequently disappointing places. An
obsessive regard for hygiene in both countries tends to rob the stalls of
the aesthetic and olfactory appeal of their counterparts in southern Europe.
There is just a bit too much plastic wrapping to stir the gastric juices.
In many cases, were it not for the much abused Turks, these institutions
would have disappeared long ago; for like the British and the American, the
Teuton prefers the bovine calm of the supermarket to the aggressive bustle
of the streets.
Still there are impressive market places in many German and Austrian towns
and cities; superb sites such as the Viktualenmarkt in Munich. These days,
however, people are more likely to descend on the Viktualenmarkt to scoff a
brace of those veal and parsley sausages the Muncheners call Weisswurste
than they are to stock up on food. In all German and Austrian cities the
or a plate of sausage.
The Viktualenmarkt's Viennese equivalent is the Naschmarkt, five minutes
walk from the Staatsoper and just behind that art nouveau jewel, the
Sezession. Indeed, for some the Naschmarkt is gentler on the eye than it is
on the stomach: the buildings were constructed around 1900 when the Wien
river was covered over and to the left and right are the Wienzeilen,
terraces which contain splendid examples from this rich period in the
history of Viennese architecture.
The first stalls in the market should be ignored, unless you are looking for
a shot of Bratwurst and a roll from one of the many Wurstelstande, a snack
at the fish shops belonging to the German Nordsee chain or a look at a few
cheese stalls and delicatessens. The stringency of the Austrian law on
cheese production and storage makes it almost wholly without interest. In
the delicatessens everything is swaddled in unsexy plastic.
Further up on the left is a stall which enchanted me on my first visit to
Vienna, almost a quarter of a century ago. It is a rare survival among the
Turkish and Serbian fruit and vegetable shops in that the accent is wholly
Germanic with its great tubs of Sauerkraut and brine-soaked gherkins.
The acrid smell which emanates from these strategically placed barrels is to
some degree off-set by the nearby spice merchants with their little packets
of paprika. These are sold at varying strengths to ensure the correct mix
for goulash. Much like Britain, Austria's gastronomic traditions were
considerably enriched by borrowing from its subject peoples during the
empire. It may be Hungarian in origin, but these days, no Austrian could
survive for long without goulash
Weekends can be a bore in Vienna. An offensive, frustrating law requires all
Austrian shops to close at midday on Saturday. It means you are required to
stock up for the whole weekend in the first hours of Saturday morning. The
law is relaxed on just one Saturday a month when shops have the right to
stay open all day. On Sundays, however, only restaurants are open, and a
gloom descends on the city which makes even London look gay.
Saturday morning is, however, the best time to visit the Naschmarkt. By
ancient tradition Austrian farmers have the right to set up their stalls at
the far end of the market, just before the flea market where, if you are on
the ball, you occasionally come across interesting old books and records.
The advantage of the Bauernmarkt or farmers market, is that fresh products
are sold without the prudish plastic coating which is the rule at the Opera
end. This is the moment to buy honey; Speck, or fat bacon, cut from the
flitch; sausages, including excellent Blunz'n, or black pudding from
Burgenland; ham; pumpkin seeds, which make an extremely good nibble with
preprandial drinks, or better still Kurbiskernol or pumpkin seed oil from
Styria. Virtually unknown in Britain, this dark oil is the soul of a Styrian
salad. At vintage time you may also buy Most or grape juice, or Sturm, which
is fermenting must, a drink which is meant to go well with onion tart.
Only on Saturday mornings does the Naschmarkt live up to the promise of its
lovely setting.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Chianti rings the changes - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IN 1984 the whole Chianti region was awarded the top Garantita
appellation, the wine's reputation and sales suffered. For how can millions
of bottles produced by thousands of growers be 'guaranteed?'.
However, two negative factors were reduced at the same time. The high
stipulated percentages in the blend of dull, high-yielding Trebbiano grapes
and over-productive Canaiolo were cut and and now are often ignored. One
grower in the Classico zone said: 'I have Trebbiano in the vineyard but not
in the wine.' Also the maximum permitted yield per ha was reduced from 70 to
52.5 hl.
Moreover, in the leading Classico district the need for improved quality has
been recognised and, with the support of the Black Rooster Consorzio's 600
members, Sangiovese Classico 2000 was set up in 1988.
Experimental vineyards were organised throughout the area. New Sangiovese
clones and new cultivation methods are being tested at a time when the
massive and often ill-advised planting in the 1960s and early 1970s must
soon be replaced.
New legislation is planned to alter the future of high-quality vino da
tavola. These were started with Antinori's Tignanello 1971, as a protest
against the high percentage of Trebbiano and other minor grape varieties in
the official blend and the refusal to admit the Cabernets and Merlot.
The Classico appellation will be allowed blends containing 100 per cent
Sangiovese, already a feature of vini da tavola, including Isole e Elena's
esteemed Ceparello and Fontodi's Flaccianello. Further, this would be
permitted for single-vineyard wines such as Tignanello, which would be
entirely acceptable to Antinori. In five years' time, one leading grower
told me, vini da tavola will be confined to the basic wines they were
intended to represent.
Then, minimum planting density per hectare will be increased from 2,500 to
3,500 vines, although this is thought to be insufficient by the best
growers, who plant between 4,000 and 5,000. though no further reduction in
maximum yields is yet provided for, informed opinion believes they should be
reduced to 40-45 hl per ha. But in Italian wine politics nothing is certain
until the decree is signed.
Moreover, the Classico proprietors are expecting a separate Chianti Classico
DOCG, as reasonably they claim a higher status than the great mass of
Chianti made from Pisa to Siena. A new DOCG would also apply to the small
district of Rufina, to the east of Florence, which includes such respected
estates as Frescobaldi, Selvapiana and Grati. Finally, a Vino da Toscano is
projected. The effect of all these changes would be to create a pyramid with
single-vineyard wines at the top. This would certainly make selection easier
for consumers.
The developments will not only apply to Chianti. Sassicaia on the Tuscan
coast at Bolgheri, where white and rose wines are already DOC, is likely to
become Sassicaia Bolgheri DOC, and, in view of its long-established
reputation, DOCG; to be followed by the new Ornellaia.
Altogether, this will cause a revaluation of the role of superior Chiantis.
In the old, fiasco-bottled days, Chianti was regarded as little more than a
quaffing wine, with little concern for vintage or maturing possibilities.
But today the Riservas have to be kept in cask for three calendar years, and
even the normal Classico must have a year in wood before being marketed.
Good vintages like '85 and '88 deserve at least seven or eight years in age,
and the exceptional ones like '82, '83 and '90 often much longer.
As few of us are familiar with the varying quality of the vintages, notes on
the last 12 Classicos may be helpful: '81 - good bouquet, medium body,
developed early but ageing well; '82 - after an exceptionally dry summer an
outstanding vintage, harmonious and at peak; '83 - again very hot summer,
fine nose, good body, lower than normal acidity; '84 - very wet September,
and poor, light wine; '85 - big structure, full-bodied, highly regarded
year, and still very good; '86 - early vintage, big aroma, well-balanced,
softer than '85 or '88, but concentrated; '87 - high yields after rain at
vintage, moderate quality, to be drunk; '88 - big wine, still closed, tannic
but should develop well; '89 - generally a poor year, light and for early
drinking, few Riservas; '90 - outstanding - 'the best for 50 years', said
one grower in adjoining Rufina. True also in Classico. Still closed. A wine
to keep; '91 - light wines for early drinking, not much quality; '92 heavy
rain from the end of September spoiled the crop, but those who picked early
made attractive wines.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Cookery: The long and the short of buying perfect pasta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOURY fad of making pasta at home seems to be on the wane. Many
pasta-making machines have joined the once-fashionable ranks of slow
cookers, yoghurt-makers and sandwich toasters, has-beens now rattling like
skeletons in the back of kitchen cupboards. Even deli-traiteurs who once
boasted massive trayloads of pasta 'freshly made on the premises daily' are
cutting back.
Yet pasta is bigger business in Britain now than ever. Most of us eat pasta
once a week; many eat it twice or more. So where does it come from? The
answer in the main is from the High Street multiples.
Half-yard lengths of dried spaghetti wrapped in dark blue paper can still be
bought, but the major part of our pasta binge is catered for by supermarket
own-label fresh pasta. But how good is it? How does it compare with a
competent cook's home made? And how does it rate against quality brands of
dried pasta from Italy, such as La Molisana, de Cecco and Agnesi?
I asked each of the High Street multiples to provide samples of their own
label offerings for two blind tastings, one of fresh and one of dried. Each
company agreed to supply its plain egg tagliatelle in the two versions. In
the event, Asda and Sainsbury failed to deliver. Tesco's fresh was ruled out
of court because it was spinach, not plain. Similarly, the dried tagliatelle
from Waitrose and Tesco were deemed hors de combat because they were
flavoured with garlic and herbs. The field, much reduced, none the less
provided an interesting study.
I subjected the pastas to a fine selection of palates: Anna Del Conte,
Britain's most respected writer on Italian foods; Josceline Dimbleby, winner
of this year's Glenfiddich cookery writer award; Simon Parkes, former
Michelin inspector and now a radio journalist; Oliver Waley, Anna Del
Conte's husband, a critical and experienced pasta eater; and Henry Dimbleby,
Jossy's son, fresh from a stint in Bruno Loubet's kitchens at The Inn on the
Park in London.
Each pasta was prepared the same way - cooked in fast-boiling salted water,
drained, but not too thoroughly, and anointed with a smidgeon of unsalted
butter (better than olive oil for taste-testing as oil has too much
character of its own).
We started with the fresh pastas. Even in their raw state the three looked
quite different. Marks &amp; Spencer was much the yellowest and the skeins
looked almost waxy. Safeways was also yellow, but less intensely so, and the
ribbons were thicker. Waitrose was pale buff, grainy looking, narrower and
dryish.
Depth of colour, Anna suggested, indicates quality. She went on to explain
that home-made (ie fresh) tagliatelle is the pasta of northern Italy,
traditionally made with nothing but eggs and soft wheat 00 flour. Dried
pasta, on the other hand, is the product of the south, traditionally made
from hard durum wheat semolina and water. That is why good fresh pasta is
yellow, eggy and delicate tasting, while good dried pasta smells and tastes
of wheat and has a firmer, floury bite.
Each of the three fresh pastas tasted very different. Anna and Henry were
especially enthusiastic about the Marks &amp; Spencer. 'Very similar to
tagliatelle as I would make it at home,' approved Anna. Indeed, it is made
with the classic ingredients: whole eggs imported from Italy (it is the
Italian eggs that give the dough its rich colour) and Italian 00 flour -
plus a little British flour to facilitate machine rolling. 'Good waxy bite,'
'lovely feel in the mouth' and 'appropriately eggy with no taste of flour'
were other appreciative comments though Jossy found it 'rather rubbery'.
Safeways fresh pasta was unanimously disliked. Anna suspected the colour was
due to carotene. Simon called it 'hard, heavy, laboured'. 'Bad pasta,' said
Oliver. 'Stodgy,' 'not good in any way' were other bricks hurled at it.
The Waitrose fresh pasta earned more praise although it was not typical of
egg tagliatelle, which one expects to be eggy not floury. It had the good
wheaty smell, the positive and very pleasant durum wheat taste
characteristic of dried pasta, and the correspondingly fine, more floury
bite that made it Jossy's favourite of the three fresh pastas we tasted.
Anna identified correctly that it was made with durum wheat semolina, egg
and water.
Moving on to the dried pastas, what with no-shows from Asda and Sainsbury,
and Tesco and Waitrose submitting non-comparable samples, we were left with
just two dried pastas from the High Street multiples. So we tasted them
against the latest Italian dried pasta to arrive in the UK, a brand called
Spinosi.
Marks &amp; Spencer's dried tagliatelle was remarkable because it was cut so
short, looking more like something from a can of Heinz than an adult pasta,
and almost impossible to eat since you cannot wind it around a fork. Anna
described it as Tuscan, for the Tuscans are so addicted to soup that they
always eat their first course with a spoon. 'Flat in looks and taste,'
remarked Simon. 'Decidedly odd tasting,' 'terribly sticky and heavy,' 'truly
dislikeable,' said the others.
Safeway's ribbons of dried tagliatelle were long, white and tightly coiled
when raw, and 'edible but not impressive' when cooked.
So unenticing were both these offerings that, after some discussion, we
decided to refresh them - to rinse them in hot water after cooking to wash
away some of the starch. This is commonly done in restaurants to help hold
the cooking point and to cope with delays between cooking and serving. Henry
had learnt it in Loubet's kitchen.
Anna disapproved but the proof was in the eating. Pasta of dubious quality
is undoubtedly helped by slightly undercooking it and then refreshing it.
Thus treated, the sample dried pastas from Marks and Spencer and Safeways
perked up. Suddenly they looked alive and the taste seemed improved. Even
so, the final verdict on the M &amp; S offering was a definite thumbs down and
the reaction to Safeways was far from ecstatic.
The Spinosi experience was totally different, eliciting accolades all round.
These tagliatelle are made with durum wheat and egg in a small Italian
factory using labour intensive methods. The beautifully thin strands are
hand cut, and its taste and its feel in the mouth are 'unmistakeably
superior,' as Anna put it. 'Fantastic to eat, bouncy and as light as a
feather,' enthused Simon. 'Delicious, full of character and amazingly
elastic,' said Jossy. 'And it holds its cooking point perfectly,' said
Oliver.
In summary, the Waitrose fresh tagliatelle at 89p per 250 gram pack was the
cheapest of the pastas we approved of. Marks &amp; Spencer's fresh tagliatelle
cost rather more at Pounds 1.19 for the same weight, and Spinosi at Pounds
3.95 cost the earth - but because of its outstanding quality the Spinosi
will stretch further.
Spinosi is the pasta that is taking over from Cipriani, about which I have
enthused before and which Danmar has now ceased to import. Spinosi is even
better to eat than Cipriani and Danmar says it is about 20 per cent cheaper.
A premium product at a premium price.
Waitrose fresh at 89p, with its agreeable wheaty taste, and Marks &amp; Spencer
fresh at Pounds 1.19, with its eggy delicacy, are affordable for everyday
meals. Both are well worth freezing. Next week: pasta sauces.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Fashion: Lightweight clothes you can fly away in - Avril
Groom recommends smart but comfortable travel wear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT RARE creature, the truly organised business traveller, is easy to
recognise. A female specimen was spotted recently, LA-bound in first class.
Straight after take-off she slipped from her power suit into something more
comfortable (silk lounging pyjamas) and went aggressively into relax mode -
no drink, no food, no fun, just an eyemask and a 'do not disturb' sign. Half
an hour before landing she reversed the process ready to zip off the plane,
all pistons firing.
Most of us are not like that. We find such fuss embarrassing. The navy
cotton jersey pyjamas which British Airways now hands out, together with
duvets, on its first class sleeper service are, according to one frequent
flyer 'gratefully received - for jogging at home', although the airline
claims that if one passenger can be persuaded to wear them the others follow
suit.
Most business travellers make do with an extra outfit which, they hope,
their suit-bag will keep uncrumpled. But ensuring that you arrive looking
unruffled is difficult. Flights within Europe are too short to allow time
for changing, though you could easily be met by a completely different
climate. The aircraft itself may be colder, or stuffier, than the weather at
either end. If you travel casually dressed, delays and traffic jams may play
havoc with your plans to change at your hotel before your meeting.
Fabric manufacturers and fashion designers are doing their best to rewrite
travel's old maxim. For them it is better to travel comfortably than to
arrive - especially if your destination is short on air-conditioning. The
secret is in modern high-tech fabrics, such as wool spun so lightly it feels
like silk, and in new fibre combinations that mix natural for comfort with
man-made for uncrushability.
Layer these fibres for maximum flexibility, but stylishly, so that nothing
looks like a haphazardly thrown-on afterthought.
Companies which court the business market have turned their attention to the
needs of the international traveller. Alfred Dunhill always uses natural
fibres, primarily fine wool, silk and cotton but, says design director Alan
Duddle, 'they have an inherent tendency to crease. We now use very
high-twist yarns which crease considerably less, and we are constantly
researching ways to produce clothes which are as practical and versatile as
they are comfortable'.
Dunhill, together with Aquascutum, does a lightweight, unlined cotton
showerproof raincoat for travelling. Burberry's version packs into a small
pouch. Its crease-resistant, lightweight gabardine interpretation of the
traditional blazer, unlined or half-lined, is another good travelling
companion. Like Herbert Johnson, they make a collapsible panama hat - you
fold it flat along its central ridge and roll up to fit in suitcase or
pocket.
For adventurous types who may feel that a blazer and flannels is good enough
to do business in, Gucci have wool trousers that look like conventional
marled flannel but feel like gossamer. This company is a past master at
matching fabrics to climate - suits for export to Singapore are specially
made in a humid environment.
Those who feel happier in a suit can find the most serious of pinstripes in
lightweight super-100s wool, as at Ralph Lauren. And Hackett, which likes to
give tradition a twist, has persuaded British mill Reid and Taylor to revive
1930s three-ply construction with super-120s wool for a plain navy, mid-grey
or khaki single-breasted travelling suit which sells for Pounds 495.
Lighter suits can mean an extra layer for aircraft or evening. A fine
slip-on or sweater rarely looks out of place. Richard Paine, of high-quality
knitwear firm Alan Paine, says cotton-silk or cotton-linen mixes are good
for summer travelling, but that light lambswool or very fine cashmere look
more stylish and should not suffer even if crumpled into your hand-baggage.
For women, the advent of softer style has made travelling easier. Giorgio
Armani pioneered a viscose / acetate mix, which scarcely creases, for his
famously floppy suits and this fabric, often with a fine rib or herringbone
texture, is now mainstream fashion from labels as diverse as Laura B,
Rodier, DKNY and Marks and Spencer.
Light wool crepe is another high-fashion, uncreasy fabric and man-made
fibres also deserve attention. Microfibre from Tactel makes soft, light,
showerproofs while polyester is no longer a dirty word as its best-quality
versions feel and act like silk - which, incidentally, can emerge quite
wearably from a suitcase if it is rolled rather than folded.
Always take an extra knit layer, cashmere or a cool, light mix such as
Rodier's wool / acrylic Kasha, or a big soft shawl - Louis Vuitton does
cashmere / silk travel throws as well as the famous hard suitcases which
treat the most delicate garment kindly.
If you are going straight to an evening event, travel in something formal
but understated, and keep your jewellery handy. But if in doubt, remember it
is the smartest-looking passenger who gets the upgrade.

FT  03 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: To travel hopefully . . . - . . . and to
arrive safely and in complete comfort, is Lucia van der Post's aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST

<TEXT>
NOW THAT few of us travel to the parts that smart hotel chains do not reach,
packing for our holidays is nothing like the serious matter it once used to
be.
If we are not conquerors of Everest, like Rebecca Stephens, or adventurers
such as Colonel Blashford-Snell, we are unlikely to meet the kind of
emergency that cannot be dealt with locally.
However, getting it right before we go seems worth the effort, if only
because it allows more time and comfort to do more agreeable things than
shop for things we have left behind. For the really intrepid traveller - the
sort who needs mosquito tablets, water purifying tablets, emergency
lighting, that sort of thing, there are two specialist shops worth
mentioning - Travelling Light of Morland House, Morland, Penrith, Cumbria
CA10 3 AZ (tel: 0931-714 488 for a catalogue) and Safariquip, The Stones,
Castleton, Sheffield, 530 2WX (Tel: 0433-620 320).
Another essential for most of us is something good to read. Bloomsbury
Classics are worth knowing about - 'small . . . but perfectly bound' goes
the blurb and I could not put it better myself. Light and packable, there
are 22 contemporary classics, such as Michael Ondaatje's Coming Through
Slaughter or Brian Moore's The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne. Each costs
about Pounds 10.
IF YOU have, as I do, a friend who is gradually going blind from too many
years spent in the African sunshine, if you know that writer Wilfred
Thesiger, too, is almost blind from the effects of the desert sun, then you
will probably not need much urging to wear sunglasses in strong sunlight.
Sunglasses are not just for the Hello] set, photographed as they stumble out
of jets or enter nightclubs. With lenses of good optical quality they are
more than just a fashion accessory, they are essential eye protection.
Unfortunately, good lenses do not come cheap. Those which are just coloured
will not protect against ultra-violet rays and are more damaging to the eyes
than wearing no glasses at all (the eye, thinking it is dark, dilates making
it even more vulnerable to the sun's rays). Most branded lenses do give some
protection but you should always check.
Having made sure that the lenses are good you can then worry about
fashionable frames. This year's latest shape is what you might call
Swot-of-the-Remove, small round frames giving an air of entirely illusory
(in most cases) scholarly distinction. Not the most flattering shape, it is
the one most in favour with the Voguettes. Sketched here is a version by
Giorgio Armani, Pounds 115, while Armani's other pair folds into a neat
leather pouch, Pounds 125. The black Valentino shades are Pounds 115 and
represent the other fashionable shape - upswept sides with protection at the
sides. All are available from Harvey Nichols and Harrods.
THERE ARE some for whom the only holiday hat is a Panama. Proper Panamas,
like the two sketched here, come from Ecuador, where they hand-plait the
fibres of the jipijapa plant to make the distinctive headgear. They are then
steamed and blocked in the US, from whence they set out on their journeys
round the world. If you are wondering why they are called Panamas it is
because north American sailors first discovered them on sale there.
The two sketched here are imported for gardeners by Pulbrook &amp; Gould. Not
only are they flattering but they can be folded and packed in a suitcase. In
cream or caramel, the one on the left is Pounds 25, the one on the right,
Pounds 27.50. Pulbrook &amp; Gould, Liscartan House, 127 Sloane Street, London
S1X 9AS, will post either for Pounds 5 post and packing.
A floppier version is made by Herald &amp; Heart Hatters. It comes boxed, ready
folded, with its own hatpin and matching silk scarf. In white, ivory, marine
blue or red, it is Pounds 50 direct from Herald &amp; Heart Hatters, 131 St
Philip Street, London SW8 3SS.
EVERY swimsuit needs a wrap. Most useful of all are pareos - if you can
master the art of tying them - which transform the skimpiest of bikini into
something relatively modest. For some years Slix has sold a selection of
one-piece bathing suits and bikinis with matching cover-ups which can be
bought separately. Shown above is a two-piece bikini with an underwired
bra-top and a matching mini-sarong which does not exactly add-up to formal
restaurant wear but does lend a vestige of cover-up to the skimpy bottoms.
Pounds 34.99 for the bikini, Pounds 21.99 for the sarong. both will be in
good department stores throughout the UK from early July.
For those who cannot be bothered with irons there is a marvellous scrunched
silk fabric which Whistles has made into a series of simple holiday (and
glamorous evening) garments. As the scrunched look is part of their charm
they can be folded, crushed, twisted and packed without coming to any harm.
There are long skirts (Pounds 59 at Fenwick), slip dresses (Pounds 129) and
cropped tops (Pounds 59). From Whistles branches, the Whistles department in
Fenwick of Bond Street, Harrods and Selfridges.
CHOOSING luggage has become a complicated business. Those who belong to the
'you are what you buy' school of thought believe that your choice of luggage
reveals volumes.
This is a school of thought I am deeply apprehensive about myself, as I feel
that my own luggage says nothing at all about my inner being but plenty
about the state of my purse and the efficacy of my shopping habits.
However, the real problem with suitcases revolves around two conflicts: on
the one hand one wants them to be light, inexpensive and easy to carry but,
on the other, one would like them to be beautiful, too.
When it comes to appearance no material, in my view, looks as good as
leather. It may be heavy, it is indubitably expensive, but the older it gets
the better it looks.
Sketched on the right, are four very special pieces, each designed to meet a
specific travelling need and each of which, while indubitably expensive, is
so finely made that it should last way beyond your own lifetime.
Henry's, an all-British leather company with a flagship store at 143 Fulham
Road, London SW3 (tel: 071-581-1321) has produced the Survival Bag, which is
small enough to fit under an aircraft seat yet seems to hold an amazing
amount.
A combination of suitcase, briefcase and document case, it also has two
flaps on the front to hold things such as passports, vaccination
certificates and the like.
One side holds the briefcase and document case while the other has four
separate deep pockets, each of which has a canvas container into which you
can put all those myriad things that seem an inevitable part of modern
travelling (the personal toiletries, the malaria tablets, the pocket
calculators, or the tot of whisky). It costs Pounds 751.
Next come three pieces from a new range by Baronessa Franchetti. First comes
The Weekender - roomy (22in by 10 in by 13) but nothing like as heavy as it
looks. It has a large, front pocket, another pocket at each end and a
detachable shoulder strap.
Like all Baronessa Franchetti's collection it is made from full hide tanned
with natural ingredients. In green and tan or black and tan, it is Pounds
375.
Next comes The Overnighter, a simple, classic Boston-style overnight bag
with a detachable shoulder strap,. 30 in by 14 in. It, too, comes in green
and tan or black and tan for Pounds 250.
Finally, there is The Suiter. Suits or dresses hang on the inside hanger and
there are three outside pockets, one large and two small, for accessories or
documents, as well as two further pockets inside. Measuring 18 in by 24 in
when closed, it costs Pounds 250. All have fine brass detailing with good
locks. Franchetti-Bond is at 7 Burlington Arcade, London W1 or 5 Lion and
Lamb yard, Farnham, Surrey GU9 7LL. (Tel: 071-629 0025 for mail order).
FOR THOSE who love gadgets the Go selection is the name to look for. Whether
you want something as simple and useful as a portable iron (The Slim Press),
some travelling adaptors, a sturdy flight bag or a tough holdall, Go will be
bound to have it.
There is a travelling laundry (tube of Kwikwash, Stain Go spot removal
sachets, a clothes line with hooks and suction cups, a PVC laundry bag,
laundry pegs and a carry case for just Pounds 4.50), an array of money belts
and bags, as well as inflatable pillows, packaway macs, blow-up hangers and
pouches.
Photographed above is the Wonder towel (Pounds 4.50) which, measuring just
70 cm by 25 cm, mops up as much moisture as a bath towel. Apart from its
uses while travelling it is ideal for the aerobics set. Also pictured is the
Aquasafe, a waterproof - if you follow the manufacturer's instructions -
belt safe which means you need not leave your valuables on the beach but can
take them swimming with you - though not, it seems, scuba-diving. Go
products can be found in most department stores and Big airports, such as
Heathrow and Gatwick, have a large selection of their wares.

FT  03 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: How to be a Bond-style survivor - Lucia van
der Post visits a shop which can supply peace of mind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARANOID will find encouragement by visiting Spycatcher, a shop in
London which specialises in 'personal protection and surveillance systems.'
There are devices to pander to eternal worriers andgoodies to soothe away
their fears.
If, for example, you are worried about becoming ill in some country where
hygiene is not all it ought to be, take your own kit. Choose from an Aids to
Survival Kit (Pounds 26), which has sterile needles bandages, gauzes, and
sutures, a Toothcare kit (Pounds 15), and an all-purpose Survival Kit
(Pounds 33) which has a combination of medicaments and items including:
sutures, salt tablets, potassium permanganate, thread and needles 'for
mending clothes, making shelters or stitching wounds', razor blades, lip
salve and a wire-saw.
If your worries centre more on what is happening back home while you are
enjoying yourself there is a panoply of anti-theft devices which could buy
you peace of mind. Simple and inexpensive are the series of cans or
containers which look exactly like ordinary household products but are in
fact small 'diversion' safes. Ranging in price from Pounds 25 to Pounds 30
you could choose from cans of Diet-Coke or Heinz Beanz, tins of furniture
wax or tubes of after-shave and shaving cream.
For those fearful for their personal safety while abroad there are lots of
small personal alarms, a 'touch-me-not' door alarm (Pounds 40, hang it on
the inside of your door and as soon as it is touched it lets out a piercing
noise), battery-operated portable smoke alarms and a wallet-sized smoke-hood
which gives you two or three minutes protection from smoke if a fire breaks
out.
If you are the sort who cannot bear to be out of touch with the office maybe
you should invest in the smallest fax in the world - not cheap at Pounds
1,000, but to the persistent deal-maker it could be worth it. It measures
about 6 in by 4 in by  1/2 in - you type in your message, plug it into a
telephone, press transmit and off it goes. Then there is a series of small
tape recorders specially modified for long play, starting at Pounds 300.
Tiniest of all is the credit-card sized version that will record for six
hours, Pounds 950.
Spycatcher is also the place for the latest in 'toys for the boys' - all
sorts of wonderful gadgets for the would-be James Bond set such as spy
cameras which double as lighters, briefcases with cameras and pens that are
also tape recorders.
Finally, some readers might like to know that there is now a portable Muslim
Prayer Clock, though at Pounds 2,500 it is clearly only for those who are
rich as well as devout. You programme in the location (London, Delhi,
Sydney, wherever), the date and the time and the clock (with the help of a
gyro compass) will point the way to Mecca. From then on it calls you to
prayer at the appointed hours and at the same time chants the prayers.
Spycatcher is at 25a Lowndes Street, London SW1. Tel: 071-245 9445. There is
no catalogue but any of the items mentioned can be sent by mail.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Pressing work in a rural idyll -
Nick Garnett meets a couple whose venture allowed them to leave the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS A DREAM many budding entrepreneurs clutch close to their heart. You
set up a part-time business venture from your urban home. Then, with a bit
of courage and good fortune, you move lock, stock and barrel to a rural
idyll and run the company from an office overlooking cow pastures or an
orchard. So far, the dream has spawned a financially realistic lifestyle for
Alex Hill.
Nine years ago, Hill bought two dozen tiny fruit presses from Hungary at
Pounds 16 each and sold them from his flat in Brixton, London. After a slow
start, the business took root and he and his wife Barbara moved with it in
1987 to a lovely former farmhouse on the Devon side of the Black Down Hills.
From a small office at the back of the house, Hill imports and sells those
fruit presses, and a range of related equipment such as fruit crushers,
hydraulic apple presses and little machines for stripping grape stalks. Vigo
Vineyard Supplies sells to Britain's commercial and hobby vineyards, cider
and apple juice makers and home wine makers.
For the 12 months to April this year, Vigo generated a turnover of Pounds
330,000 on which it returned a pre-tax profit of Pounds 30,000 as well as
providing Pounds 20,000 for the family to live on. These figures underplay
the profit margin because a lot of gross profit goes into stock. This stood
last month at Pounds 50,000 worth. Turnover of more than Pounds 300,000
compares with Pounds 39,000 in 1988-89.
'I guess a lot of people fantasise about doing something like this,' says
Hill. 'We love it here and certainly wouldn't go back to London. I couldn't
cope with it here though if I was on my own. It's very quiet. You need a
family around you.'
In 1981, during a cycling holiday in Hungary, Hill spotted small fruit
presses for sale; wooden baskets with a metal thread press and cast iron
base. Hill, a home wine maker, asked a friend travelling in Hungary the
following year to bring one back.
'A lot of my friends saw this and asked whether I could get one for them.'
Hill is a former motorbike messenger with a university degree in
international relations. He had been working for a relative's import and
export firm. 'That taught me that you could buy a shipload of stuff in one
place, send it halfway round the world and cream off some money without even
seeing the commodity.'
Hill visited the trade department of the Hungarian embassy in London and was
given the name of the Hungarian trading company that handles exports for the
press manufacturer. 'I shipped across two dozen in 1984 using the British
freight forwarding company the Hungarian trading outfit used.'
Yellow Pages provided the names of home brew shops. 'I borrowed my sister's
car and visited 13 or 14 shops in Kent and Sussex. I sold them all
straightaway. The ex-works cost was Pounds 16 each and I sold them for
Pounds 40.'
Hill then plunged in with an order for 400 at Pounds 8,000, the Hungarians
providing 180 days' credit. He stored the units under a railway arch. A
public library's collection of Yellow Pages provided addresses for 400 shops
across the UK selling home brew equipment. With the help of a Pounds 40 a
week enterprise allowance, he sent out an A4 advertising sheet. 'We sold all
the machines well before the 180 days were up.'
Vigo bobbled along, generating between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 40,000
turnover a year and marginal profits and losses until 1989. 'I decided we
needed a much bigger range of items. I travelled a lot in Italy, Germany,
Austria and France, visiting agricultural machinery and vineyard equipment
shows as well as manufacturers. I always came back with briefcases bulging.'
The company began selling new items like centrifugal apple mills, hydraulic
fruit presses, grape crushers and high-speed de-stalkers. Turnover in 1990
jumped to Pounds 150,000 and to Pounds 232,000 two years later.
Vigo's products range from a Pounds 75 crusher to a Pounds 45,000 automatic
cider press. Sales are generated by word of mouth and advertising in
specialist magazines such as The Grower and The Grape Press. Vigo has taken
a warehouse in a nearby village on a 12-year lease and employs a full-time
warehouseman and two part-time staff for book-keeping and secretarial work.
Transport, advertising, warehousing and staff each cost about Pounds
12,000-Pounds 15,000 a year. The company has financed itself with a little
help from a bank overdraft.
Vigo presents Hill with some management problems. Tied to the D-mark, the
Hungarians are pricing themselves out of the market and eroding Vigo's
margins. Hill expects to switch most of his purchasing to Italy, whose 1m
registered vineyards support an array of manufacturers. Sales are limited by
the size of the UK grape harvest. 'If it's a dismal summer and autumn, and
they cannot sell fruit, then we do not sell equipment.' Business is
seasonal: 75 per cent of turnover is between August and November.
The biggest long-term headache is the indestructible nature of much of the
machinery Hill sells. 'It is a worry that when natural growth of the
business ceases there is really no replacement market.'
So Hill is starting to market products with repeat sales potential, such as
corks, bottles and chemicals used in drink-making. The Hills have also been
making cider for commercial sales right up to the 7,000 litres a year
allowed before the application of excise duty. They have just brought out
their own sparkling cider.
One thing the business has taught Hill is not to be too confident. One
venture failed when he contracted one of the Hungarian companies to make
play-pens. They were made badly and fell apart as soon as they arrived,
losing him Pounds 5,000.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Gardening: Sissinghurst is still an absolute joy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYTHING, since Einstein, is supposed to be relative. Absolutes,
allegedly, are out. Tell people that something is better than something
else, and most of them will react as if you are saying more about yourself
than the object in question. I wish them the best of luck.
For years, I have believed there is no better garden than Sissinghurst, in
Kent. Gardens, however, do vary with time and, in order to be sure, you have
to continue visiting them.
It is 10 years since I last put Sissinghurst at the top of the British
league. Meanwhile, relativists have muttered: have you seen it now the
polyanthus no longer can be bedded-out en masse? After all, 30 years have
passed since the founding partners died: can it really sustain the
Nicolsons' view of what gardens are all about?
What about the crowds? Have not the frosts been too unkind too often? What
about Pam and Sybille, the two great bearers of the Sackville-West legacy
who retired two years ago after their inspired tenure as head gardeners?
I know all these mutterings and many more: 'I went to Sissinghurst recently
and I did think that it was going back . . . have you seen what the National
Trust is doing? . . . isn't it dreadful about the alstroemerias? . . . Hebe
Quicksilver did not last long in the White Garden after you wrote so
politely about it . . . Vita never would have allowed it to look so tidy . .
. they have gone and removed the meconopsis . . . aren't the people
frightful? . . .'
Last year, there was a new note to the whingeing chorus: what are we to do
about the timed ticket? Sometimes, you might turn up with a Glyndebourne
picnic in the car boot and find the great British public had turned up, too,
and that the silly National Trust kept you waiting for more than an hour
until the garden was sufficiently empty. In 1991, some 200,000 visited. The
timing of tickets cut that to 150,000 last year, but it remains 10 times as
large as the number in Vita's day.
Anyway (or so the whinge goes), the Sackville-West style has been absorbed
so widely that you can see it all over the world, wherever a stockbroker
lives in an oast house or a lady member of the Garden Club of America has
made a garden in a suburb on the East Coast.
Last Sunday morning, the sunshine was serene: the day had been scripted by
H. E. Bates and, just before the first of the timed tickets entered, I found
myself in the gardens prepared, for a moment, to believe the whingeing might
be right. Could a new head gardener keep up the act? Would it not now be too
familiar, if only through imitation? Like Gertrude Jekyll's books, might not
Sissinghurst's borders seem rather out-dated now that we plant finders can
discover so much more to grow?
The whingeing is absolutely wrong. It is not just that I was the first to
stand beneath that famous central canopy of the white rose longicuspis, in
the heart of the White Garden where hundreds of bees drowned the whingeing
in a superior, contented chorus. Against its ground plan of green box, it
shone soothingly: so what, you imitators, the bees murmured? Do you, too,
think that you can get it quite so right?
Every garden changes, but I cannot see any signs of decline. The point about
Sissinghurst is that it continues to change in the artistic vanguard. I
never knew Vita Sackville-West, but I have been one of her closest readers
and, if she was still there and allowed to enjoy the luxury of the Trust's
seven gardeners, I believe she would have wished to change her garden in
just this way.
The new head is Sara Cook, who is manifestly in keeping with the genius of
the place. Aged 35, she moved to Sissinghurst from the National Trust's more
recent challenge of the large garden at Upton House, near Banbury. At
Sissinghurst, there is less scope for lavender and none for terraces but,
for Cook, it was more a return than a departure.
Previously, she had served in the garden under the great partnership of
Misses Schwerdt and Kreuzberger, both of whom endorsed her succession. As
they had served with Vita herself, there is an apostolic succession about it
all.
On Cook's staff, the four men out-number the three women, but Nigel Nicolson
tells me the gender balance is not representative. When Sissinghurst
advertises for a gardener, about four-fifths of the applicants are females.
In its cosmetics, Sissinghurst is not a stale garden left behind by
progress. It has all the best new bedding plants and half-hardy favourites.
In its framework, it is still true to its origins, and Harold Nicolson's
placing and eye for proportion will never go out of date. Some of the older
rambling roses have a pleasantly time-warped feel, but they merely remind us
that this garden has been made during 60 years.
In the bright sunlight, I saw why parts of this garden have been so
difficult to photograph justly. The light is intense and unshielded in the
main rose garden: visitors, but not cameras, can pick up the dozens of
details.
Sweet Williams lurk beneath a great tangle of blue Clematis durandii and its
satin petals on peasticks. A great buttress of Trachelospermum releases its
sugary scent from hundreds of fading white flowers, looking like stars above
the intense blue of an unusual Felicia which has been bedded underneath.
Photographs cannot catch these details among the glare of full sun and the
challenge of strong pink and purple old roses.
The Cottage Garden is another matter, where the inspired combination of
yellow, red and orange flowers is soothed by the constant inter-play of
green and shade and the tones of the old brickwork. Here, on a cloudless
day, even the strong red roses on the climbing Parkdirektor Riggers lost
their metallic gleam.
Photographs over the years have confronted these contrasts and failed to
catch them. As always, I noted the masterly touches: the tender pink
convolvulus against the brick-red tower, or the dark blue flowers of bulbous
Brodiaea which run through the low perennials in the purple border in June.
I also noted the garden's extreme exposure to light and the consequent
heightening of Nicolson's areas of unplanted green.
Go and see it, on a morning this weekend when the white roses will still be
visible (although perhaps not as perfect as last Sunday). Argue, if you
must, that Keats is only another poet and that Jane Austen seems special
only to people who never read Aphra Behn. Some things are not staled by
repetition or diminished by contention. As Sissinghurst changes with the
times, it is there to prove you wrong.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM A non-resident UK citizen (I live in France) with a relatively small
amount of British income. But I make a UK tax return since I get an annual
rebate of a few hundred pounds on tax deducted from dividends. From 1991/92
on, I have had some income from literary composition written abroad and
published in the UK.
For the past 12 months, I have tried without success to obtain information
from the Inland Revenue on what expenses I can deduct from my royalties. Can
you tell me? And how can I persuade the Revenue to answer my letters?
Under article 12 of the France-UK double taxation convention (as amended in
1987) you are entitled to exemption from UK tax on your royalties. Write for
a claim form to the Inspector of Foreign Dividends, Lynwood Road, Thames
Ditton, Surrey KT7 0DP, mentioning the reference number under which your
claims have been dealt with (or rather not dealt with) at the Foreign Claims
Branch. At the same time, you might like to ask for a copy of the free
pamphlet IR120 (You and the Inland Revenue).
Incidentally, you are not strictly correct in talking about 'tax deducted
from dividends.' UK dividends have been paid without deduction of tax since
April 6 1973. What you have been claiming is a payment of tax credit: the
distinction between tax credit and deducted income tax will become clear
when you submit your claim for tax credit in respect of dividends paid
during the present tax year.

I HAVE lent my son-in-law Pounds 39,000. I have a written acknowledgement
and could soon be seeking repayment. No interest payment was specified and
none was made. Will the Inland Revenue be able to claim income tax at some
specified rate on the loan?
Not unless your son-in-law invested the money (or part of it). If he did
invest it (or put it into an interest-bearing account), then the income
which he derived from it will be assessable upon you - and not on him - by
virtue of, for example, section 672 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988.
There are other anti-avoidance provisions which might conceivably bite -
section 786 (Transactions associated with loans and credit), for example -
but it seems unlikely from the bare facts outlined in your letter. If you
are in doubt, it could pay you to consult a local accountant or solicitor.

BECAUSE OF problems in his business, I have been making my son personal
interest-free loans for the past few months, all without written
documentation. I believe this private agreement is of no concern to anyone
else, including the taxman? Am I right?
Broadly speaking, the answer is yes - unless, of course, your son's tax
inspector asks where the money in question came from. For a number of
reasons, though, it would be as well to ask your son for a written
acknowledgement of the loans.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Tigers with eastern promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAMES full of dragons and tigers paint an exotic, rather threatening picture
of unit trusts investing in south-east Asia - but their performance over the
past decade has earned them a rather more friendly image with many private
investors.
Those dealing in the Far East excluding Japan - principally Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and the
Philippines - have outperformed the average of unit trusts over every period
up to 10 years.
For example, the average growth of funds in the sector over seven years is
254.7 per cent, but the average for other unit trusts over the same period
is 80.9 per cent.
Over five years, all but one of the funds in the sector has done better than
the average of other unit trusts over the same period. Funds invested in the
Far East including Japan have not done quite as well.
The reason is that most of the economies in the region have been
concentrating on industrialisation and development, and growing much faster
than those in the west.
Even though growth has slowed in some countries on the Pacific rim, others -
such as China - have started to boom and the region as a whole shows no sign
of running out of steam. Once recovery takes hold in the west and Japan, the
export-orientated economies of south-east Asia should benefit, too.
'It is difficult to believe that there is anywhere that is as attractive,'
says Peter Chesterfield, Far East director for Abbey Unit Trusts. 'I think
the returns will continue to please.'
Adaline Ko, who manages the South East Asia Growth fund for Save &amp; Prosper,
adds: 'We are still very positive on the region. We feel it is one of the
fastest-growing parts of the world, especially during a recession in the
western world and Japan.'
Many of the region's markets are still classified as emerging markets. They
are in developing countries where the stock market might be small and not
regulated as carefully as in more developed nations. It might not be as
liquid, either. Such markets are seen as riskier - but the rewards can be
high.
The region also has some well established markets, such as Hong Kong and
Singapore. But established markets are no guarantee of stability: the Hong
Kong stock exchange can be particularly volatile.
Unit trusts investing in the Far East usually are either single-country or
regional funds. The former can give high returns if the country's stock
market is going through a boom period, but they can underperform regional
indices seriously during bad patches.
Past performance is no guide to future performance. Take Providence
Capitol's Thailand fund, which was the best performer over the past year,
growing by a very healthy 68.1 per cent.
Over two and three years, though, it languished at 41 and 42 out of around
50 in the performance tables.
Hong Kong-dominated funds had a bad time last year, slipping from the top of
the rankings to the middle. Gartmore's Hong Kong fund is an extreme example
 -it is the best performer in the sector over two, three, five and 10 years,
and second-best over seven years - but it plummeted to 30th over the past
year.
Regional funds can spread the risk more evenly between different countries,
and managers can change the weighting given to each country in the fund
depending on their view of its economy and stock market growth prospects.
Here, a good manager's performance can be more consistent, within the
constraints of the markets as a whole. The drawback is that the diffusion of
risk means these funds cannot take as much advantage of a spectacular rise
in any single market.
Funds in this sector aim to maximise long-term capital growth rather than
provide income. Dividend yields in this area are fairly low, except in the
Hong Kong market.
The usual advice to private investors is to put only a small portion of
their portfolio into a Pacific region fund. Although the markets can produce
good short-term gains, their greater volatility means that a longer-term
approach is the most prudent.
The Chinese economy, for instance, is felt to be overheated at present, and
any cooling measures taken by the Beijing government may have an impact on
sentiment in Hong Kong, where most of the funds have a large proportion of
their holdings. But this should be a temporary setback.
'Although we are happy in the long term, it is not necessarily going to be
smooth all through the years. Occasionally, there will be slow-downs,' says
Ko.
'The problem is that, at this stage, we really cannot say whether China will
come down for a very hard landing or a milder one.'
Simon Nicholson, of Gartmore, adds: 'In general, if you have got a strong
constitution, you should have some money in the Far East. You have got to
have the guts to sit on the tiger and ride it. If the market falls, you
should do a bit more and sit it out.'
Another reason for going into any unit trust with a long-term view is the
initial charge, generally about 5 to 6 per cent of the amount invested: you
need to stay in the fund long enough to recoup your money. Annual charges
are in the 1-2 per cent range.
Unit trusts in this sector do not qualify for full Pep investment, which
means that a maximum of Pounds 1,500 can be put into them using a Pep.
The minimum investment in most of the funds is Pounds 1,000, but some also
offer saving schemes for smaller or more cautious investors.
These start at Pounds 20 a month for the Gartmore Hong Kong fund, Pounds 35
with Save &amp; Prosper, or Pounds 50 a month for the Fidelity South East Asia
fund.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: A new strategy for income shares -
Two trust groups recently warned shareholders of the dangers of reinvesting
dividends in income shares. But Ian McKeever suggests ways sophisticated
investors can profit from reinvestment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN MCKEEVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIMPLEST kind of income share provides only dividends and a negligible
capital payment when the trust is wound up. These are often called annuity
shares (for obvious reasons) and probably are the most misunderstood of all.
They substitute a taxable income stream for an untaxed return of capital and
forego any hope of capital gain except in the very short term. This might be
in the price, but it makes them attractive only to non-taxpaying investors
such as pension funds and charities or, more interestingly, Pep-holders.
They are very rewarding for these non-taxpayers who, effectively, pay only a
small premium for the net dividends and receive in addition a 20 per cent
tax refund from the Inland Revenue. This provides a very good investment
return.
The problem of the lost capital remains, but what matters is the total
investment return after tax. The capital gain on zero coupon preference is
an attractive surrogate for interest on a deposit account. In this case the
opposite is true: the dividend stream is an attractive surrogate for capital
or capital gain in a Pep.
All that is required is that the dividends be re-invested. Although the
price of the individual shares might fall, the portfolio would hold an
increasing number of them and its market value should increase.
Because the investment return is received from a dividend stream, rather
than realising the underlying portfolio, the risk is of falling dividends
rather than falling market values. The return is immune to the effect of low
market values when the trust is wound up.
As the number of dividends to be received is constantly reducing, the market
value of the shares will tend to fall as wind-up approaches. If dividends
are re-invested, this will be more than compensated for by the increase in
the number of shares held.
The past year has provided two reasons for falls in gross dividends.
Dividends have reduced marginally over the past 12 months but the extent of
this for the market overall is small and the unusual nature of such an event
has been shown by the media attention paid to reduced dividends from, for
example, Barclays and BP. The more serious risk is of political change: this
year's Budget has reduced gross dividends by 6 per cent.
Clearly if the strategy of reinvestment of dividends is followed, eventually
the whole investment will be in the final dividend from the trust. Even so,
the risk of a substantial fall in that dividend is much less than that of a
substantial fall in the market values of the underlying assets. Where the
trust holds a revenue reserve this will also be distributed with the final
dividend, further stabilising the amount available for the final payment.
The problem with reinvesting dividends is the need to obtain an increasing
number of shares. As wind up approaches, the price of the income shares will
be falling rapidly and the dividend income will be rising equally rapidly.
The effect of this on the demand for the shares will eventually be enormous.
For example, only a very few people investing Pounds 6,000 in a Pep of Jos
Income Shares would eventually end up holding the whole issue of this class
of share capital. For the investor this is not really a risk because there
is the option of selling the holding at the inflated market value and
repeating the exercise with another income share further from maturity.
For a Pep holder they represent a relatively low risk investment in spite of
the apparent unattractiveness. Assuming reinvestment of dividends and no
dividend growth the expected return would be around 8 per cent. If dividends
grew at 5 per cent per annum the return would be around 13 per cent. Even if
dividends fall these shares should offer the Pep investor a positive return.
An alternative application for a Pep investment in income shares is for
school fees planning. All that is needed when the fees come to be paid is
for the dividends to be paid out rather than reinvested. This eliminates the
risk of having to sell shares after a substantial fall in the stock market.
Other strategies are possible. An investor could invest part of his capital
in income shares through a Pep and invest part directly in zero coupon
preference shares. The income shares would provide a growing income and the
zeros would ensure the return of the original outlay on wind up.
This might be particularly suitable for retired people who could maintain
their income after that by using the money to purchase an index linked
annuity. This would then be a more attractive proposition as they can then
confidently expect to be somewhat older.
With these income shares the tax advantages are likely to far outweigh the
Pep managers' charges even after the budget changes. The only disadvantage
is that the capital loss will give no tax benefits.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Exeter's benefits bypass investors -
Doing the Splits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS Exeter Preferred Capital investment trust been a success or a failure?
Much depends on your point of view.
The managers have been able to increase the assets by 34.3 per cent, to
128.9p per share, since the launch in January 1992. But investors have
scarcely seen the benefit; the share price is now 101p, just 1p above the
issue figure.
Exeter Preferred is not strictly a split capital trust. Technically, it has
only one class of share; its zero coupon security is a debenture rather than
a preference share. But it invests exclusively in the shares of split
capital trusts.
Its fortunes (and that of its investors) are tied up with those of the split
capital sector. And its manager, Ian Henderson Associates, specialises in
split capital trusts and has launched a range of unit and investment trusts
devoted to the split sector.
At launch time, the idea behind Exeter Preferred sounded clever. It would
invest in high-yielding income shares and zero dividend preference shares of
split capital trusts.
Then, it would make annual provision for the rise in the value of its zero
debenture and offset this, for tax purposes, against its dividend income.
Benefits would be twofold: tax efficiency, since the trust would pay tax on
only a small part of its income; and enhanced performance, since the
'interest' on the zero is not actually cash flow and can, thus, be
re-invested.
Furthermore, while the zero debenture increased in value at 11.15 per cent a
year, the trust's aim was to invest in other zeros yielding 11.5 per cent a
year and income shares (yielding 15 per cent). The result would be to 'gear
up' the return on the ordinary shares to 13.5 per cent a year.
Shareholders, however, would find that this return did not come as income
because the trust would be retaining its income for the tax-efficient
reasons described previously.
So, the return would be as capital gain, and the managers felt confident
enough to predict a final net asset value, in 2002, of 340p a share. In
other words - as the trust's broker, Greig Middleton, said in a research
note at launch time - the ordinary shares were 'designed to look and behave
like zeros.'
All this might have been extremely sophisticated but problems occurred very
early in the trust's life. As the UK recession continued to bite, it became
clear that many companies were being forced to cut their dividends.
In turn, that raised doubts on whether split capital trust income shares
could maintain and increase their dividends.
The prices of income shares fell by 20 per cent between January and October
1992. That had a direct impact on Exeter Preferred's portfolio; by October
1992, the net asset value had dropped to 85p.
While income shares were falling, zeros were rising and, indeed, the trust's
own zero debenture was still growing relentlessly at 11.15 per cent a year.
Accordingly, in September last year the trust changed its strategy. It sold
some of its holding in zeros and used the money to 'de-gear' by paying off
Pounds 6m of its own zero debenture.
This might have led to confusion about its aims. David Thomas, of Greig
Middleton, wrote recently: 'EPC's simple arithmetic of adding an assured
dividend return to a rolled-up dividend yield has subtly given place to
something different.
'The zeroes remain safety ballast but there is now a considerably geared
exposure to heavily-geared hybrid income and capital shares. EPC will depend
much more on the movements in equity prices than it did at inception.'
Now, the portfolio is divided between zeros (42 per cent); old-style income
shares - those which have a fixed repayment value (30 per cent); geared
income shares (18 per cent), and capital shares (9 per cent).
The good news is that prices of both income shares and zeros have rebounded
very heavily since sterling's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism, and the subsequent falls in interest rates.
The trust decided to increase its gearing in June by raising Pounds 7m in
the form of a bank loan, yielding 8.37 per cent. Thus, it has, effectively,
replaced part of the zero debenture with cheaper debt. So why, given some of
the positive events of recent months, is the trust at such a wide discount
of 21 per cent?
Perhaps it is the structure, which might be perceived as too clever by half.
Perhaps it is because shares, which apparently were devised to behave like
zeros, have not done so.
Certainly, the Budget change to advance corporation tax did not help. By
reducing the tax credit on dividends, it hit the core strategy of Exeter:
the re-investment of gross dividends.
Can Exeter come back into favour? 'There is the prospect of the discount
narrowing once investors realise the potential of the trust for turning
high-yielding income shares into capital gain,' says Lewis Aaron, investment
trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities.
'But they should also understand the risks. The interest rate effect which
boosted the zeros in the portfolio could work the other way. However, on
balance, the trust should provide a good total return - at least equal to
the market - over time. '
Key facts
Exeter Preferred has total assets of Pounds 63m, and is due to be wound up
in 2002. The annual management fee of Ian Henderson Associates is 0.3 per
cent of gross assets, subject to a minimum of Pounds 30,000 a quarter.
Board
Chairman Timothy Kimber is a former executive director of Lazard Brothers.
Other directors are Peregrine Banbury, head of the investment department at
Coutts; David Brooke, a director of JO Hambro; Peregrine Moncrieffe, chief
executive of Buchanan Partners; and Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen, managing
director of Victoria Palace Theatre.
Savings scheme and Pep details
There is no savings scheme. The trust shares are Pepable via a self-select
plan.
This is the last in our series on split capital investment trusts. Next
week, we begin a series on unit trusts.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Paying the price of being famous -
Bethan Hutton looks at insurance premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON

<TEXT>
THE PRICE of fame could well be paid in highly expensive insurance premiums.
Household names from sport, theatre or television are - perhaps surprisingly
 -lumped with scrap metal dealers, bookmakers and journalists as
'undesirables' by many of the large insurance companies when they request
motoring cover.
Other occupations that may face higher premiums are market traders; casino,
night club and amusement arcade operators; bartenders; disc jockeys; foreign
diplomats; students, and members of the armed forces.
A company's response to such applicants can vary from point-blank refusal,
to requests for further information, to an automatic premium loading of 25
or 50 per cent.
Famous people can pay more because companies reason that, if they depend on
their face for a living and have an accident that damages it, an injury
claim could be very expensive. The greater chance of driving while tired or
after drinking lies behind higher premiums for such night workers as bar
staff, disc jockeys, casino employees and some journalists.
Scrap metal dealers, market traders, bookmakers and dog and horse trainers
get a rough ride at most companies. Some point to all the driving between
race tracks, or the possibility of causing or incurring injury when driving
through a crowded street market. A more honest reply might be that people in
these occupations are considered to be 'moral hazards' and not trustworthy.
Any sideline, particularly if you use your car for it, can affect your
insurance rating - say, if you take a stand occasionally at an antiques
fair. You might find yourself classed as a market trader.
After several bad years, companies are trying to clamp down on claims and
increase revenue wherever they can. One dodge under particular fire is
insuring a car in another person's name, and then naming the high-risk
person as a driver. Companies, burnt by experiences of young drivers
insuring cars in their parents' names, have taken to rating a policy
according to the worst-risk driver named.
Another hazard lies in changing employment after taking out a motor policy
and neglecting to tell your insurer. If your new job is one the company
frowns upon, it would be entitled to refuse to pay out after an accident
because you had not disclosed relevant information.
For the same reason, it is also better to resist the temptation to describe
your job as something more innocuous, or to give it a deliberately vague
title such as 'executive.' But the jobs which companies regard with
suspicion, and the premium loadings for 'higher risk' occupations, vary
between companies so it pays to shop around.
SelectDirect, a new telephone broking service, found only 12 insurers
willing to quote for a journalist but, of those that would, several charged
less than for a financial adviser (for whom most insurers were happy to
provide a quote).
The new breed of direct telephone insurers, like GA 1-2-1 and Direct Line,
can offer lower motor insurance premiums - but usually only to low-risk
drivers. They can have much stricter underwriting criteria, too - rejecting
anyone under 25, for example - and may also refuse occupations acceptable to
other insurers. So, if a direct insurer turns you down, try a broker
instead.
If you are a member of a union or professional body, find out if it has any
special insurance arrangements. Equity, the actors' union, is one that does
because its members often find it impossible to get cover elsewhere.
Retirement or redundancy can reduce the premium load, but some insurers are
reluctant to cover the unemployed. And there may still be some weighting of
premiums when you retire because of your former occupation.
In the long term, there is the hope that insurance companies will alter
their view of your job, but a lot depends on attitudes and the claims
records of each insurer. Doctors used to be regarded with as bad risks
because of their long hours and emergency call-outs, but that seems to have
changed.
Your occupation can also influence your acceptability to insurers when it
comes to household contents. Here again, the famous come off badly.
A major area of concern is whether your absences from home are well known -
if, for instance, you present a live television programme, or are riding a
horse in the three o'clock at Newmarket, or are answering questions in
parliament. Insurers fear that an alert burglar might take the opportunity
to call.
Another worry is that souvenir hunters may pounce on the homes of
entertainment and sporting stars.
Antique dealers, jewellers, market traders, scrap metal merchants and the
like also face problems with household insurance: criminals are known to
target the homes of owners of cash-based businesses, or ones where valuable
goods may be brought home.
Jobs requiring long absences from home, such as airline pilots, oil rig
workers, soldiers or sailors, also worry insurance offices. But you can make
them happier if you can show that another family member or a housekeeper is
likely to be there when you aren't.

HUNTLEIGH Technology has been one of the few recent stars of the health and
household sector. Montague Samuels, a non-executive director, has sold
100,000 shares at 410p while a colleague, Dr SJ Cook, has disposed of his
remaining 11,000 at the same price.
Mini-conglomerate Suter has seen considerable director activity. Chairman
David Abell sold around 110,000 shares but he, Robert Morris and Anthony
Owen bought substantial amounts of Suter warrants.

WHAT ARE private investors to make of the Financial Times' new 'total
return' indices?
The indices, which appear daily, have been designed largely with
professional investors in mind. Professional managers who provide
index-tracking services - that is, portfolios designed to mirror returns
from an index such as the FT-A All Share - need to know exactly how that
index is to be measured.
The two independent performance measurement services have used slightly
different methods of calculating the FT-A. Thus, depending on which service
is used, pension fund trustees may come to believe their manager is not
coming up to scratch.
But while the new indices offer greater clarity for professionals, they may
muddy the waters for private investors. Those who own index-tracking unit
trusts are likely to find even greater deviations from the index than
previously.
Barry Holman, director of index-tracking funds at insurer Legal and General,
says distortions are likely to occur in several areas. First, the total
return index uses stock prices at the close of business, whereas most unit
trusts use midday prices. Also the new computation assumes re-investment
gross of tax on the dividend payment date, regardless of when funds are
actually received.
While pension funds may mitigate against slow payments, many unit trusts are
constrained from doing so. Also, pension funds are tax-exempt so it is
sensible to calculate returns without deducting tax. Unit trust holders,
however, enjoy no such exemption.
Holman says, though, that he does not expect significant confusion among
individuals who own index tracking unit trusts. 'People who buy these things
tend to be pretty sophisticated,' he added.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits on
Monday of about Pounds 202m compared with the previous 53 weeks' Pounds
221m. The results will reflect lower property profits and exceptional costs
of reducing staff numbers. Growth at Center Parcs is unlikely to make up for
tough trading in the brewing and retailing sectors.
Dixons, the electrical goods retailer, is expected to report on Wednesday
pre-tax profits for the year to April of about Pounds 80m, up from Pounds
70.8m a year earlier. Some increase in UK profits will be offset by
continuing losses in the US.
Taunton Cider should brighten the market on Wednesday with forecast profits
of Pounds 17.5m for its first full year after flotation. The cider market
grew during the past year at close to 8 per cent against a 3 per cent
decline in beer, and Taunton's brands were well placed at the premium end of
the market.
Greene King, the East-Anglian based brewer, is expected to report full-year
profits little changed at Pounds 20.3m on Thursday. Growth in the free trade
is believed to have slowed, and although the company's managed pubs have
performed well, beer sales are down in the tenanted houses.
Howden Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, is expected on
Wednesday to report flat annual profits of about Pounds 18m after being
adversely affected by exchange rate movements.
Wednesday brings annual results from Budgens, the small UK food retailing
chain in which Rewe, one of Germany's largest food retailers, bought a 26
per cent stake in April. Budgens is expected to have increased pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.5m to between Pounds 6.5m-Pounds 7m and to resume
paying a dividend.
Most interest, though, will focus on the intentions of the Germans towards
the group, which management is trying to re-shape in a fiercely competitive
environment.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Umbrellas, how safe are they? -
Philip Coggan examines funds with big appeal to offshore investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS AN UMBRELLA fund the right home for your rainy day money? The idea behind
an 'umbrella' is that a large number of different types of funds  - US
equities, international bonds and so on - are grouped together.
This is nearly always done in some offshore administrative centre, such as
Luxembourg or the Channel Islands. While the tax advantages of an offshore
centre for UK residents are fairly limited, this does allow umbrella funds
to appeal to investors world-wide and, in particular, wealthy expatriates.
The idea behind the umbrella structure is to make it easy for the investor
to move his funds from one asset category to another without excessive
costs. A good umbrella fund ought to allow free switching (or, at best, a
nominal charge). The smart investor, for example, could have moved out of
equities and into bonds (or cash) before the crash of October 1987.
It also makes for administrative convenience for the fund manager.
Technically, investors usually are shareholders in the overall group, rather
than in the individual funds. This means that only one annual report has to
be issued, and only one prospectus launched with the relevant regulator.
Fidelity's Luxembourg range of funds, for example, is an open-ended
investment company with 23 classes of share, each relating to a separate
portfolio of securities.
For a while in the mid-1980s, umbrella funds mushroomed because of a tax
advantage for UK investors. Switches between funds were free from capital
gains tax. Investors faced a CGT liability only when they took money out of
the umbrella altogether. That loophole was removed in 1989; now, a UK
resident who switches from, say, Japan to the US could face a CGT bill on
any Japanese fund profits.
Offshore funds are, for UK tax purposes, divided into distributor and
accumulator funds. Distributors must pay out 85 per cent of their income as
dividends. UK investors must pay income tax on the dividends but any other
profits are taxed as capital gains.
Accumulators do not pay out income but 'roll it up' within the fund.
Neverthless, all gains are taxed as income, not capital gains, although only
when investors sell their holding. They can, therefore, be useful for
postponing a tax liability. If an investor knew he was going to retire and
move into a lower tax bracket, he could invest in a roll-up and take profits
at the most tax-efficient moment.
Furthermore, the roll-up can enhance performance. Since tax is postponed,
investors can compound their investment gross rather than net.
Offshore funds can also pay income gross. This gives them an advantage over
UK unit trusts, albeit one which should partly be eliminated in the next
Budget. Expatriates, or those who move regularly between countries, may well
find it convenient and tax-efficient to keep their investments within an
umbrella.
The down-side, of course, is that you are relying on the investment skills
of one management group, which might be excellent at managing bonds but not
equities. Also, many funds are dollar-denominated, which means that
non-dollar investors face an extra layer of currency risk.
In the wake of scandals such as Barlow Clowes, how safe are umbrella funds?
Many can be found in the back pages of the FT's first section under the
heading 'SIB recognised.' This means the Securities and Investments Board
has accepted that regulation in the offshore administrative centre is
equivalent to that in the UK, and the funds have satisfied SIB they are run
in a proper manner. Some funds can be marketed only through intermediaries;
but if they fall into the EC's approved UCITS category, they can be sold
across European borders.
Guinness Flight has umbrellas covering both the accumulation and
distribution types of fund. There are 14 separate roll-up funds and 30
separate distribution funds.
Normally, roll-up funds tend to invest in the money markets (ie, mainly bank
deposits) or in bonds, where income is high enough to get the full benefit
of the roll-up process. Guinness Flight, however, has two equity funds
(international and European) within its range.
It cites good performance for the funds, with Finstat showing 11 of 14
having above-average perfomances over the year to June 1, and 11 of 12 above
average over three years.
Fidelity's range of distributor funds has a minimum investment of Pounds
1,500, initial charges of 5.25 per cent for equity and 3.5 per cent for bond
funds, annual charges of 1.5 per cent for equity and 1 per cent for bond
funds, and switch fees of 1 per cent.
Fleming has both distributor and accumulator Luxembourg funds under the
Flagship label. Minimum investment is Dollars 2,500; charges are 5 per cent
initial on the distributor funds, nil on the roll-up funds. There are no
switching fees.
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark has a Luxembourg-based Global Opportunities
umbrella range. Its initial efforts are concentrated on six sub-funds, three
in bonds (US Mortgage Backed Securities, Global Bonds and Emerging Markets
Income) and three in equities (US Quality Growth, Global Equities and
Emerging Markets Growth).
The funds are not SIB-recognised but Scudder, Stevens is a well-established
US investment firm with Dollars 70bn under management.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Now it's son of Taurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK exchange's decision to abandon its overly ambitious Taurus project
for paper-less share trading and speedy settlement created a vacuum.
Earlier this week, though, a task force led by the Bank of England suggested
a way of achieving many of Taurus's objectives, albeit at a lower cost and
amid significantly less wrangling among interested parties.
The project is to be known as CREST, because, in the words of the task force
chairman, 'it seems to be an encouraging, up-beat name with no down-side.'
Private investors should be encouraged by the task force's suggestion that
the Treasury's intention to eliminate stamp duty on transactions, which was
to have occurred with the introduction of Taurus, should coincide instead
with the advent of the new project.
For the private investor, there are several key differences between the new
proposal and Taurus, the most significant of which is that paper-less share
dealing and speedy settlement will be at the option of the client.
Thus, clients who take comfort from physical possession of share
certificates can continue to hold them and can count on receiving new paper
when additional shares are bought.
The problem, according to the Association of Private Client Investment
Managers and Stockbrokers (APCIMS), is that they are likely to have to pay
more to execute trades. But because CREST is not expected to be working
before 1996, it will be some time before investors need to make a decision
on whether having share certificates is, in fact, essential.
Those shareholders who want to earn the benefits of the lower-cost,
paper-less trading system may select a broker who is a member of CREST. But
the shares will have to be held in the 'nominee' name of the broker for
transactions to take place.
ProShare, the organisation set up to promote wider individual share
ownership, says it is unhappy with moves to encourage the transfer to
nominee names because it inserts a layer of bureaucracy between the company
and its owner, the shareholders. But Michael Baker, chief executive of
APCIMS, says there is nothing wrong with moving to nominee names.
'The Securities and Investments Board has laid down criteria for private
client stockbrokers,' he said. 'As long as the stockbroker meets those
requirements and is a member of SIB's investor compensation scheme, clients
should have little reason for concern.
'Private client stockbrokers have reported to us that a significant number
of clients have already switched to nominee names in advance of Taurus.'
Investors may check if their broker is covered by contacting SIB.
What may be significant for the estimated 500,000 British private investors
who trade their shares actively is the axeing, no later than next July, of
the two-week account settlement period.
By early 1995, the settlement period - the time between the date a bargain
is struck and the date the payment and ownership change hands - will narrow
to only five days. But Baker said: 'Many of our members regret the
decision.'
It means that investors will have to stump up cash for purchases much more
quickly. Also, those who buy shares, and then raise the cash for them by
selling others - say, a week later - will find that financing technique
closed to them.
Baker said it was estimated that around 10 percent of all transactions on
the exchange were 'netted' deals that occurred in the middle of the account
settlement period. So, a portion of private client business was likely to
disappear.

<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows the 10 largest offshore sterling denominated fixed interest
funds with a three year performance record. The funds shown are recognised
by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator for the
financial services industry in the UK.
Some, such as Hambros EMMA sterling bond fund and Gartmore's Capital
Strategy Sterling fund are sub-funds of umbrella funds.
The funds are quoted on an offer-to-offer price which measures the
performance in terms of the change in the price at which the units or shares
were bought. It does not take charges into account because some funds have a
single price but add a charge. Quoting on this basis gives an enhanced
performance figure, compared with onshore funds.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Tokyo treads water - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock market continued to tread water this week, with very low
volume trading as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the general
election on July 18. The Nikkei average fluctuated in a narrow range between
19,400 and 19,950, failing to challenge the 20,000 barrier it broke through
during a rally earlier in the year.
Traders say the index is unlikely to break out of the range during the
political uncertainty before the election. A bribery scandal, involving
general contractors and a city mayor, shook the market early in the week and
had a further dampening effect on market sentiment.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Markets: Why fans love the Bundesbank's game - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Germans have been entertaining us this week. Wednesday's Wimbledon
quarter-final between Boris Becker and Michael Stich was exciting. But more
thrilling was the Bundesbank's ace on Thursday when it cut interest rates by
as much as anyone had hoped.
While this was more appreciated elsewhere in Europe - other Europeans cut
their interest rates, the UK did not - it was regarded generally as positive
for the London markets. That might sound odd, since the Footsie ended the
week lower after attempting to break the 2,900 level in the first half. But
dropping a few points does not mean losing the match. A German rate cut
makes a UK reduction more possible, if not as yet likely.
However, while the Germans were providing enjoyment, the Americans were
dashing British hopes as fears grew that the US economic recovery is
weakening.
A few US statistics, such as housing starts and employment numbers,
suggested that the authorities there should consider cutting, rather than
increasing, interest rates. A stalled US economy would not be at all helpful
to the UK since about a quarter of the Footsie's earnings come from north
America. And Pete Sampras's straight-sets victory over Becker as the week
drew to a close does not augur well if you take it as a metaphor for a weak
US economy overpowering the German rate cut.
Still, there has been a fair bit of good news for the UK equity market this
week, notably what has been happening to gilts. A few weeks ago, there was
good reason to worry about them. The public sector deficit, projected at up
to Pounds 50bn, meant that new stock was bound to be coming at the market at
a high rate. It had looked as though the market could be overwhelmed.
In the past three months, though, about Pounds 20bn of gilts have been sold,
putting the funding programme well ahead of schedule. This week saw a Pounds
3.25bn auction of gilt stock - the biggest ever attempted  - followed within
hours by another Pounds 800m of new stock.
The auction was a crucial test of sentiment and, at first, it looked as
though the market had been out-played. There were barely enough bids to
cover the amount of stock on sale, and the difference between the average
bid price and the lowest accepted price was wide by the usual standard.
However, the market did recover its poise to receive another slug of stock
by the afternoon. Dealers said the market-makers, who usually go short of
stock ahead of an auction, had not done so this time.
Gilts are being supported by buying from foreign investors. As well as
relatively high yields available on UK bonds they have also been gaining on
the currency as the pound has risen, particularly compared to the D-mark.
If that strength looks set to continue - and the pound gained almost five
pfennigs over the week - foreign buyers should still be attracted into
sterling.
A rising gilt market gives support to the equity market, too. Yet, by the
end of the week, equities were feeling decidedly anti-climactic about the
German rate cut. And if the gilt market has passed the test of its ability
to cope with calls on its liquidity, the equity market is nearing its big
match, with some of the terms of the BT3 sale having been announced this
week. A 10p discount is being given to retail investors - enough to pay for
a local telephone call.
Retail demand for equities has been high this year, with unit and investment
trusts seeing good inflows and new issues being well-subscribed. This week
even saw the return of the ballot as a method of allocating shares, when
Field Group's offer for sale was 7.4 times subscribed.
There has been plenty of positive corporate news, too. On Monday, Heron  -
Gerald Ronson's property group, which was the corporate equivalent of two
sets and a service break down - appeared to have fought back when its
creditors approved re-financing proposals.
The week also saw results from Brent Walker, Ascot Holdings (formerly
Control Securities) and Ratners, soon to be re-named Signet, each survivors
of a similar exercise to Heron's. None is anywhere near fit again - all
three making sizeable losses - but each can at least hope for a return to
health.
Asda, the food retailer which has recovered from set point down, whipped up
a Pounds 142.1m profit for its latest financial year. Then, its chief
executive, Archie Norman, rather spoilt the celebrations by saying that the
future for the big grocers was bleak.
Hanson was back on the bid trail when it lobbed in an agreed bid worth a
total of Dollars 3.2bn to buy Quantum Chemical Corporation of the US - a
move reminiscent of the good old days. Hanson is gambling on an up-turn in
the polyethylene cycle, a plastic used for packaging. If it is right, it
will have regained its old form of buying assets cheap and played a winner.
The end of the week saw Rentokil power an apparently unplayable smash with
an increased bid for Securiguard and the purchase of nearly 30 per cent of
its target's equity in the market.
As City folk were going home at the end of the week, the police were
beginning to set up road blocks around the Square Mile. The story put about
is that the security cordon is to keep terrorists and their bombs away from
the UK's financial centre. But the truth might be simpler. It is not
terrorists but aggrieved Lloyd's Names heading for Monday's egm that they
are trying to deter.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Markets: Dark clouds over the holiday beaches - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street's dealing and investing community headed off to the beaches for
the long holiday weekend yesterday with plenty on their minds.
If anything is going to spoil their enjoyment of the Independence Day
celebrations it is the state of the economy. A string of data released this
week underlined the fragility of the recovery.
On Thursday, the National Association of Purchasing Management published its
June report on nation wide manufacturing activity. The NAPM index fell below
50 for the first time in more than a year. When the it drops below 50, it
generally means that the manufacturing sector is contracting.
On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported a decline in consumer confidence
during June. President Bill Clinton's planned tax increases seem to have
persuaded consumers to keep their spending in check, at least until they
know how exactly much more the Federal government will be taking from their
pay packets.
Finally, yesterday the Labor department released its June employment report,
and it made for gloomy reading. Non-farm payrolls rose by a meagre 13,000
last month, well short of the 130,000 to 150,000 increase forecast by Wall
Street economists. Although the rise in the national unemployment rate, from
6.9 per cent to 7.0 per cent, was expected, investors still did not
appreciate the sight, more than a year after the recession ended, of a
rising jobless rate.
At first glance, the employment data turned interest rate forecasting on its
head. For most of this year, the markets have assumed that the next move in
rates would be upward, as the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy to
curb inflation.
Yet, the June report appears to rule out any tightening, at least for the
near term, and it may even herald a policy easing. Those economists who have
bravely stuck to their predictions that the Federal Reserve's next
interest-rate move would be down rather than up, must have felt vindicated
by the jobs data.
The chances of an interest rate cut, however, remain slim. The June report
was not wholly negative - April and May payroll figures were both revised
upwards to show increases of 255,000 and 215,000, respectively. The upward
revisions led some analysts to warn that the small June increase may prove
to be a freakish number, possibly skewed by the fact that the survey upon
which the payroll figures were based was taken unusually early in the month.
Labor department statisticians said this meant a substantial number of June
hirings may have been missed, new jobs that could turn up in the July data.
Government number-crunchers, however, seem to have an answer for everything.
The big picture is quite clear - the labour market is not as robust as it
should be at this stage of a recovery. Consequently, the June jobs report
could still force the Fed to reconsider its recent decision to shift the
emphasis of monetary policy towards a tightening. Analysts believe it is
possible that the central bank will return the emphasis of its policy back
to a neutral stance.
Such a move would be good news for equities, because it would remove the
immediate threat of higher interest rates. It has been the favourable
interest rate environment, more than any other factor, that has propelled
stocks upwards over the past two years, so more of the same should ensure
that, at the least, equities hold their ground.
This is exactly what stock prices did this week - hold their ground,
although in a rather roundabout way.
On Monday, the Dow jumped 40 points, buoyed by the latest rally in Treasury
prices, which took bond yields to new lows. Then stocks turned tail,
gradually at first, then rapidly, after the June employment report was
released. By midday yesterday, Monday's 40-point burst had been completely
wiped out, and the Dow was back where it started the week, hovering around
3,490. That is 65 points short of its all-time high (set on May 27), but
still registering a respectable 6.7 per cent gain for the year.
While the domestic news was almost all bad, there was one important piece of
foreign news this week that, over the longer-term, should be good for
equities: Thursday's cut in German interest rates.
Although the half-point reduction in the discount rate was less than
dramatic, it was better than nothing and, by most accounts, much needed. The
US can only hope that the Bundesbank's easing will help drag Germany, and
the rest of Europe, out of recession, in the process reviving US exports to
the region. At the moment, the US economy needs all the help it can get.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Markets: Rentokil on the warpath - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM Rentokil to Rent-a-mob? The environmental and property services
company, best known for its pest control business, yesterday looked set to
win its first hostile takeover when it upped its bid for Securiguard, the
security and cleaning company.
But Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil since 1983 and chief
architect of its heady growth, has yet to win the wider argument - whether a
low quality, low margin business like guarding can sparkle under the
Rentokil treatment.
Rentokil began business early this century as a maker of rat poison. It
later acquired a Danish parent, Sophus Berendsen with 56 per cent, and a
stock market listing in 1969.
But it was in the 1980s that the company's fortunes, and its share price,
took off. Under Thompson, it targeted business services such as cleaning and
tropical plants supply and realised correctly that companies were willing to
pay more for good service.
The tropical plants business, for example, was built up by acquisitions and
expansion overseas into one of the largest such companies in the world.
Previously a low value service, Rentokil lifted its margins from single
figures close to 20 per cent through raising prices and quality levels.
Thompson is convinced he can do the same with manned security, even though
Securiguard's margins are only about 5 per cent. 'It's the same trick. It's
running a service business, and we happen to believe we're very good at
running service businesses,' he says.
If it wins Securiguard, the Rentokil 'trick' would involve looking at the
security company's training, marketing and technology. A 'raft' of
incremental improvements will lead to higher margins, Thompson says.
'People are prepared to pay a price premium so long as service levels are
higher. And prices don't have to be all that much higher to improve
margins.'
Despite Rentokil's record, some analysts are not convinced Thompson is
right. They will be watching closely to see if companies really are prepared
to pay more money for what is still seen as a straightforward service.
'Companies may think about security during bomb scares, but usually it is
price not service driven,' according to one analyst.
Whether it is Thompson or his detractors who are correct will largely decide
the direction of Rentokil's share price.
As the graph shows, the shares have performed very strongly since 1987 and
have outperformed the FT-A All-Share index by almost three times since
Thompson took control.
Rentokil's record since the mid-1980s of lifting profits 20 per cent a year
earned it one of the highest ratings on the stock market, making the shares
very expensive to buy.
But they fell sharply after the company's results announcement in March.
This was because the market started wondering whether the company's record
of 20 per cent profits growth was sustainable.
According to the detractors - who are easily outnumbered by supporters  -
Rentokil's 'trick' was no longer working.
They pointed to a slowdown in the UK especially, and said Rentokil needed a
large acquisition to maintain earnings growth. Two months later, the bid for
Securiguard was launched.
Thompson has insisted that Rentokil wanted Securiguard for the business
rather than short term earnings. It spotted that manned security was
suitable for some Rentokil trickery, he said.
There is probably truth in both camps. Rentokil is now a very large,
maturing business which last year made profits of Pounds 122.4m. Further
rapid growth can only come through acquisition and moving into other new
market areas.
And acquisitions can only get bigger. Analysts agree that after waiting ten
years to make his first hostile bid, Thompson will not wait as long again.
'They wanted Securiguard for the business, but also as a learning experience
for a really big bid,' according to one analyst.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Markets: A savings option that paid off - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the First Option Bond was launched in July 1992, the pound was still in
the Exchange Rate Mechanism and base rates were 10 per cent.
Those who rushed to buy the bond in its early weeks (provoking howls of
protest from the building societies) can pat themselves on the back. They
have earned 10.34 per cent gross, or 7.755 per cent net, over the year and
have been able to gloat while their friends and neighbours suffered the fall
in building society rates to 6 per cent and below.
Bonds start to mature on July 7. National Savings will be writing to holders
to tell them that the rate for the coming year will be 6.34 per cent gross,
or 4.75 per cent net. Anyone with Pounds 20,000 invested, including last
year's interest, can earn a bonus of 0.4 per cent gross (0.3 per cent) net
if the bond is held for another year.
Holders who want to earn that return need take no action; your money will be
automatically reinvested. If you want to cash in your bond, complete the
form on the back and send it to National Savings in Glasgow.
It is possible to earn more than the new First Option bond. Britannia
Building Society is offering 6.75 per cent gross on investments of over
Pounds 1,000; the rate is guaranteed for 13 months, after which investors
can withdraw their money without penalty (but not before then). As our Best
Rates table shows (on Page VI), higher returns can be earned from variable
rate accounts.
You can earn over 7 per cent on gilts, if you are prepared to hold the bond
for five years, and you do not mind turning part of your capital into
income. If you want more than 8 per cent, you have to look at gilts with a
maturity of 10 to 15 years. If you are a firm believer that inflation is
conquered, and you believe the government will control the budget deficit,
then 8 per cent offers a very healthy real return. Of course, those are two
big 'ifs'.
In April 1992 and January this year, I wrote about a simple stock-picking
theory devised by Michael O'Higgins, a US fund manager. Take the ten highest
yielding stocks in the Dow-Jones Industrial index and select from them the
five with the lowest share prices. You hold these stocks for a year, and
repeat the process, discarding those which no longer meet the criteria.
O'Higgins found that between 1973 and 1991, a portfolio selected using the
theory made an annual average return of 19.4 per cent, against 10.4 per cent
from the Dow.
Applying this theory to the FT-30 index in the UK over the period 1979 to
1992, annual returns were 22 per cent, compared with 17.5 per cent from the
All-Share. At the start of the year, the theory threw up Blue Circle,
British Gas, Forte, Hanson and Lucas.
The good news is that so far this year, the theory has worked. Up to June
30, the shares made the following returns: Blue Circle, up 26.6 per cent;
British Gas, up 2.2 pc; Forte, up 20.7 pc; Hanson, down 3 pc; and Lucas, up
3 pc. The average is 9.9 pc, compared with 5 pc for the All-Share.
Of course, the above calculations do not allow for costs, but nor do they
allow for the higher than average dividend yields which the selected stocks
should pay.
Readers should be aware of many caveats. A small portfolio of stocks will
inevitably be volatile; just because the theory worked in the past does not
mean it will in the future; and the above stocks are not the FT's
recommendations.
Coincidentally, Michael O'Higgins was in London this week. He had distinctly
gloomy views about the prospects for world stock markets, believing we are
due for a big fall in the US market, with the Dow Jones Index dropping from
its 3500 to somewhere around 2200 over the next 12 months.
O'Higgins believes that the investments where money will be made over the
next 12 months are gold, oil, resource-based economies such as Latin America
and Australia and selling short major stock markets such as the US and
Japan.
Why does he hold these views? He believes the US market is expensive, in
terms of key statistics such as p/e ratios, price-to-asset ratios and
dividend yields. There are long periods in history, he argues, when
corporate earnings have increased but stock prices have gone nowhere because
price-earnings ratios have declined. Someone who bought shares in 1929 would
have still been behind 25 years later.
Admittedly, O'Higgins is only a small manager by US terms with Dollars 150m
under management. But he can cite a strong record, with his median fund up
115.6 per cent over three years, compared with 32 per cent for the median US
equity fund. O'Higgins has launched a Bahamas-based fund, Mabrecose, for
non-US investors but the minimum investment is a hefty Dollars 1m.
Certainly, there are other commentators who are worried about stock prices
(see Barry Riley's Long View on Page I). Even if they are not as gloomy as
Michael O'Higgins, cautious investors can certainly afford to wait before
switching their funds into equities.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Saigon, where the past is another country: Once the premier
city of Vietnam, now it is named after Ho Chi Minh, whose communist troops
conquered it in 1975. Nicholas Woodsworth, who lived there as a small child,
has just been back
</HEADLINE>

WHEN I was seven, my family moved from Ottawa, a placid northern city of
snow banks and bureaucracy, to Saigon. Here, for the first time, I
experienced the sweltering bustle of an Asian city in the tropics and felt
an excitement which has stayed with me. But, even to a small child, it was
obvious that an exotic climate was the least of differences between this
city and my own secure world.
In 1959, Saigon was between two wars. It was neither the French provincial
city it had once been, nor the war-fattened American rear base it was to
become. The catastrophic French defeat of Dien Bien Phu had taken place five
years before. It would be another six years before the first American troops
waded into combat off the beaches at Da Nang. But, in a city of eternal
debacle and recovery, 1959 was a year as portentious as any: it was the year
in which Ho Chi Minh began sending North Vietnamese soldiers over the 17th
parallel in aid of the south's 'national liberation.'
For my father, it was the beginning of a diplomatic posting he was to find
the most tragically compelling in a lifetime of postings. As a member of an
international commission set up to monitor post-colonial peace accords
between the communist north and the western-backed south, he was to watch
the rapid dissolution of Vietnam's fragile stability and its slide back into
confrontation and war.
For me, of course, there was nothing tragic or compelling about it. Adults
found it difficult enough to see a meaningful pattern in the deceptions,
political intrigues, corruption and misplaced enthusiasms that made up
Saigon at the time. Children did not try. As Vietnam became an ever more
obsessive concern in the minds of American anti-communist strategists - the
first 'domino' that they believed would set south-east Asia toppling - my
own mind pursued more immediate concerns: those of discovering a new,
different, and wholly alluring world.
For more than 30 years after, I carried round a set of childhood images of
Saigon, some hazy, some etched deeply and fixed forever. Recently, I
returned to Vietnam. Like me, like the entire face of the earth, the city
has changed. Once again, Saigon became a new and different world to
discover. Through the wondering eyes of a seven-year-old, any place at all
has the ability to fix in the mind the vivid impression, the haunting image.
What surprised me about Saigon is that it retains that power still.
WE LIVED in a large, walled compound in a villa built in the French Art Deco
style of the 1930s. Beyond the wall lay a wide boulevard, a river down which
a stream of motor-cycles, bicycles and three-wheeled cyclo-pousses flowed
from dawn to dusk in full, noisy spate. Unlike Canada, where life's
intimacies lay hidden behind double-glazed windows and thick curtains,
Saigon revealed itself in unself-conscious fashion on its footpaths.
Children urinated in the gutters. Women washed themselves squatting on the
ground in front of enamel tubs. Old men with bony rib cages dozed on hard,
wooden beds. Scribes bashed away at antique typewriters. their clients
dictating at their sides. Dentists yanked teeth, barbers cut hair, doctors
ministered, saffron-robed bonzes promenaded with begging bowls in hand. It
was smelly, hot, noisy - and, to a child trapped with his parents in the
back seat of a black diplomatic car, infinitely appealing.
But small boys rarely were let loose into the melee of Saigonese street
life. Although the French no longer ruled Indochina, Saigon was still very
much a city with a French flavour, an outpost of French commercial interests
in the metropole, and home to the families that oversaw them. We lived the
kind of privileged life that French expatriates throughout Asia and Africa
had made for themselves and enjoyed for decades.
I was enrolled in a French school, made blotted messes in my cahiers with
old-fashioned nib pens, and muddled over the mysteries of French verb
conjugation. My older sister, influenced by schoolgirl friends and visits to
Saigon's pink brick Notre Dame cathedral, developed an obsession with
Catholicism and announced her intention of becoming a nun.
At the Circle Sportif, we swam and sunbathed and watched staid colonial
matrons raising eyebrows at that daring new French invention, the bikini. At
home, we chased geckos and lizards across the walls. At the back of the
house, we crouched on our hams in imitation of the gardeners and house
servants and, fascinated, watched them hack and spit and smoke tobacco
through thick, bamboo tubes. On weekends, there were drives through rubber
plantations to water-skiing on the Saigon river; on holidays, we stayed at
country auberges in the hills and pine forests of Dalat.
Only occasionally in this cocooned existence were there hints - talk
overheard at adults' cocktail parties of civil disturbances, riots, brutal
government repression and a war going badly in the hills and paddy fields to
the north - that Vietnam was not simply some wonderfully warm and sunny
playground. By the time we left in 1961, Saigon was already a city sitting
squarely in the path of a fast-accelerating, oncoming disaster.
IT IS 18 years since Hanoi's tanks smashed through the gates of Saigon's
presidential palace and brought the cataclysm of the Vietnam war to an end.
But signs of that great disruption are everywhere in the city's physical
make-up, and more disturbingly, in its population. The war's aftermath is a
drawn-out trauma from which Saigon is easing itself only slowly.
French Saigon is still there but, in today's re-named Ho Chi Minh City, it
lies buried, like an archaeological layer, under more recent, successive
accretions deposited by Americans, Russians and North Vietnamese. To find
it, one must burrow.
I took a room overlooking the former rue Catinat, once the heart of colonial
Saigon and today called Dong Khoi (or Victory) street. The hotel of the same
name, once known as the Hotel de la Liberte, might once have been a gracious
pile; today, it is a gloomy and crumbling relic. Its decorative stained
glass windows are cracked, its marble and wrought iron staircases are dirty,
its tiled Dollars 18 suites have been painted a dingy, battleship grey. From
my upstairs balcony I searched the street, looking for signs of the past.
There are still antique shops lining the avenue, and you can still find
delicate crystal and bronze art nouveau lamps, pocket watches from Besancon
and Geneva, old editions of Stendhal and Camus. But these now share a place
with newer antiques more popular with today's visiting souvenir hunters.
There are Zippo lighters engraved with the sexual doggerel of lonely
18-year-old GIs who, if they are alive at all, are now in their middle age.
There are rusty field compasses, naval clocks, altitude gauges from US
warplanes, army-issue eye-glasses, insignia and shoulder flashes, and even
old jungle combat boots.
There is something tragic and obscene in this trading in bloody memories,
but it is not nearly as tragic as the human war mementoes who also haunt the
street: amputees who stump, wheel-chair cases who roll, living on handouts
and charity. Nor is it as sad as the city's remaining Amer-Asians, the issue
of hasty rest and recuperation liaisons with servicemen, some of whom
continue to live in Saigon in spite of an American programme to take them
'home.' Nor as wasteful and unrealised as the scores of Saigonese street
children who roam the old rue Catinat, products of a dislocated society,
living by vending and begging and petty theft.
Everyone aged more than 20 has a war story here. Strolling along the street,
you will meet fortune tellers who used to be businessman, second-hand book
traders who were senior government officials, noodle cooks who once flew jet
fighters.
Remnants of Vietnam's smashed and painful history are everywhere. They loom
large in the old concrete-shielded and pillar-boxed US embassy, from where
diplomats, top soldiers and politicians fled in a chaotic, roof-top
helicopter evacuation in 1975. They are evident, too, in the dull, east
bloc-style architecture erected on city boulevards by the Soviets before
their own recent departure. They surround the steel and glass one-time
presidential palace - today Reunification Hall, the seat of local rule by a
Hanoi government 1,200 kms to the north.
Saigon's disjointed past made finding my own past difficult. When the
southern republic disappeared, so also did all the officials, administrative
bodies and documentation that might have helped me in my search. Visits to
various offices proved useless; officialdom in Vietnam today is no
lighter-handed than elsewhere in what remains of the socialist world.
Somewhere in the stored archives of the former regime, I was told in a
polite but stony-faced manner, there probably was a record of where the old
International Control Commission villa was located. Unfortunately, though,
it could take weeks or months to find - or not be found at all. I rented a
bicycle and began to look for myself.
THERE IS a line in the opening pages of Graham Greene's novel of Vietnam,
The Quiet American, which stayed in my mind as, hour after hour, I cycled
through the humid, soupy atmosphere of Saigon's crowded streets. When jaded
and world-weary war reporter Thomas Fowler loses Phuong, his Vietnamese
mistress, to a naive young American diplomat newly-arrived in Saigon, he
reflects bitterly on the meaning of Phuong's name, which in Vietnamese means
Phoenix. But 'nothing nowadays is fabulous,' he tells himself, 'and nothing
rises from its ashes.'
Greene was pessimistic about the fate of Vietnam even when he wrote The
Quiet American in 1954 and foresaw the tragic consequences of growing US
involvement there. What would he think of Saigon 40 years later? I wondered.
In spite of the great ache left by the war and a damaging US trade embargo
that continues even today, Saigon is rising from its ashes. Greene might be
pleasantly surprised.
Saigon might be known officially as Ho Chi Minh City, but its inhabitants
rarely call it that. For more than a decade, Hanoi's attempts to re-make the
city's substance and spirit in a socialist mould rarely were successful.
Since 1990, with Vietnam's gradual re-admittance of market economies and an
open-door investment policy, Saigon has become a place that hums and throbs
ceaselessly with entrepreneurial energy.
A few blocks up from the Dong Khoi hotel on Le Loi Boulevard, both the
French colonial past and the American war seem only a distant dream. Even
from the seat of a slow-cruising bicycle, you can feel the impetus that has
turned Saigon into Vietnam's leading force for social and economic change
and the busiest, most productive city in the nation.
At the entrance of the newly-renovated Continental Hotel, once headquarters
for generations of war reporters, I watched European, Australian and even
occasional prospecting US businessmen dash through the heat from meetings to
their air-conditioned rooms. In front of the busy Ben Thanh market, young
Vietnamese men roared by on shiny new Japanese motor-bikes, the fruit of
labour in one of the city's sprawling factories, textile mills or
middle-tech assembly plants. A little more sedately, but much more
fashionably, legions of young Saigonese women scudded by on scooters, fitted
out elegantly in over-sized sunglasses, bright dresses, and colour
co-ordinated driving gloves that stretched to their elbows.
Cycling down by the docks on the Saigon river, where the fictional Fowler
watched US warplanes being unloaded, I saw container ships from Piraeus,
Panama and Yokohama unloading their own less-destructive cargoes of foreign
factory equipment, cars, television sets. It will not be long before Saigon
is making some of these things itself.
Pedalling about late at night, I watched crowds of laughing Vietnamese
emerge from some of the scores of city bars and dance clubs that have opened
recently. By the standards of the recent past, even the names of these
places are shocking: 'Apocalypse Now', 'Good Morning Vietnam', 'B4-75.' In
their dress, their behaviour, their evident enjoyment of life, these
Vietnamese on an evening out could be British, French, German or - dare one
say it - young Americans.
There are many travellers in south-east Asia, self-perceived purists of
oriental culture who, arriving in Saigon, look somewhat disdainfully on the
city. You must go to Hue, or Hanoi, or into the villages, they say; Saigon
is not the real Vietnam: it is a fickle, cheap, neon city, the tart of
Indochina, tainted by decades of contact with western values and western
commercialism.
I disagree. Saigon is the entrepreneurial city it has always been. Unlike
the North Vietnamese, its inhabitants are a commercial people with an eye
always on the main chance.
This same materialistic vitality also gives them a joie-de-vivre; a sensuous
pleasure in colour, movement, noise, food, conversation and company.
Saigon's psyche is southern, and as different from that of Hanoi as Brussels
is from Marseilles. Compared with much of south-east Asia it is still an
old-fashioned, bicycle-ridden city, but is a place that roars and swirls
with life. It is a place unlikely to remain old-fashioned for long.
AFTER THREE days of cycling, I finally found the ochre-coloured French
colonial house for which I was looking. It had changed little. Behind its
high wall, the semi-circular architecture, portal-shaped windows and
high-columned verandahs were just as I remembered them.
In the end, though, the Saigonese villa of my childhood failed to come alive
 -it remained as static and dream-like as it was in my memory. Perhaps it is
true that there is no going back. Saigon has been through so much since, and
seems embarked so determinedly on yet one more stage in its turbid history,
that the house is a walled-off piece of history.
What fills my imagination now are other, equally vivid images collected
while looking for a past - those of an energetic, restless Saigon looking
for a future.

FT  03 JUL 93 / The Long View: Markets on a tightrope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR, it is going more or less according to plan. At the beginning of the
year, I suggested that the stock market would soon hit a high but would then
struggle, and that it would be hard to make money except in second-liners
and recovery stocks. But I wonder if the stock market will get a bit more
volatile later in the year.
The first half-year was dull indeed. The high was reached on March 8; since
then, the Footsie index of 100 leaders has tracked sideways relentlessly. It
was. however, a very different story in small company stocks, with the
SmallCap index forging ahead steadily and showing a gain of 21 per cent
after six months. With evidence of economic recovery accumulating, it was
particularly agonising to be in recession-proof growth stocks (with Glaxo
off more than a quarter, for instance).
This mediocre performance in UK equities is quite odd in one respect because
the bond market has been consistently strong. Long-dated gilt-edged yields
have fallen from 9 per cent in mid-January to 8.1 per cent at the end of
June, which represents the unsung success story of the financial markets in
1993 so far. The pessimists who expected gilt yields to climb towards 10 per
cent are looking a little embarrassed.
Inflationary pressures have subsided more rapidly than most people expected
and sterling has recovered its balance, encouraging foreigners to re-appear
as major gilt-edged investors. But the margin of safety remains slim, as the
narrow cover of only 1.1 times showed at this week's Pounds 3.25bn gilt
auction of 10-year bonds.
Falling gilt yields normally would have encouraged price strength in
equities, but dismal dividend prospects have prevented that. Not only are
underlying dividend payments showing no growth but the company tax changes
in the March Budget clobbered tax exempt investors by cutting their tax
relief, so that pension funds have suffered a 6 per cent fall in their gross
dividend income from UK equities compared with a year ago.
In the meantime companies, by burying the market in new paper, have been
signalling clearly their belief that shares are overpriced. Equity issues
have totalled almost Pounds 7bn so far this year, and this month's first
instalment for the BT3 issue will absorb another Pounds 1.9bn or so. Normal
institutional cash flow of around Pounds 35bn a year is nowhere near enough
to cope with this flood of equities on top of the torrent of gilts.
Fortunately, there has been some help from a leap in unit trust net sales.
These have risen from under Pounds 1bn to possibly near Pounds 4.5bn in the
first six months as small savers have bailed out of low-interest deposit
accounts. An influx of US pension fund money has helped, too.
Where do we go from here? In a sense, the UK market has been following the
pattern set last year on Wall Street when a slow recovery and low interest
rates caused the stock market to be trapped interminably between hope and
payoff. Because American share prices have continued to track broadly
sideways in 1993 so far - the FT-Actuaries US index is up just 3.5 per cent
in dollar terms - there is a strong precedent for continued narrow ranging
in London. But this would be a remarkable balancing act, and it is unlikely
that stability will be so persistent.
Interest rates hold the key. In the US, short-term rates have been held
steady at 3 per cent for 12 months now. There is much nervousness about the
circumstances in which they might go up. A huge volume of US government
paper has been absorbed by the banking system, with handsome profit margins
created by the steepness of the yield curve (which goes up to 6.7 per cent
for the long bond).
A double threat is posed to the US equity market by these circumstances. If
the American economy strengthens convincingly and short-term rates are
raised, there could be a very nasty shake-out in bonds because of the
contraction or elimination of the yield differentials, and higher interest
rates would undermine stocks, too.
On the other hand, if the economy remains disappointingly sluggish and the
bond market crisis is avoided, corporate earnings will fail to achieve the
demanding recovery targets expected by investors. It seems unlikely that the
US economy will continue to be just strong enough for the markets to balance
on their present tightrope.
In the UK, by contrast, the immediate question is whether short-term rates
have further to fall. Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, apparently does
not want to cut (at least before he can tighten fiscal policy in his autumn
Budget), but he might well be forced to respond to a DM crisis during the
summer.
The Bundesbank threw down a modest gauntlet on Thursday, cutting its
discount rate by half a point to 6 3/4 per cent. A further drop in sterling
deposit rates, triggering an accelerated flight into unit trusts and
equities, just might lead to a final surge in the already highly-priced UK
equity market. The negative response to the Bundesbank's rate cut this week
did not, however, exactly indicate bottled-up strength.
My inclination would be to sell into any strength, and prepare for a
buffeting later in the year if Wall Street takes a tumble. There is a 3.5
per cent inflation-proofed yield available on index-linked gilts, offering
tough competition for equities where the yield is just 3.9 per cent with
poor dividend growth prospects for the next year or two.
As for fixed interest gilts, the ratio of the long gilt yield to the equity
yield is 2.1, significantly higher than it was while the UK was in the
European exchange rate mechanism (it fell to about 1.8) and too high for
comfort unless inflation starts to look threatening again. In fact, London's
markets are positioned to cope with an inflationary dash for growth by
Clarke. The downside risk for equities, therefore, is that he will play a
waiting game.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Gold price rises to highest level since Gulf war: Sir James
Goldsmith's sale of Newmont Mining shares starts surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of gold, driven by New York investment fund activity, rose sharply
again yesterday to close in London at Dollars 390 a troy ounce, its highest
level since the Gulf war 30 months ago.
Share prices of gold mining companies worldwide followed the precious metal
upwards.
The latest gold surge started on Wednesday after Sir James Goldsmith, the
international financier, announced he was to sell another big block of
shares in Newmont Mining, North America's largest gold producer, and buy
gold bullion instead.
Gold moved up Dollars 5.25 an ounce on Thursday in London and rose another
Dollars 6.50 yesterday.
Some analysts, however, suggested that gold's rise had more to do with the
rains which have prevented soya beans being sown across a wide area of the
US. This caused the US Commodity Research Bureau's futures index, seen by
New York investment funds as an indicator of future inflation, to move up
quickly, triggering a move into gold and silver as a hedge against
inflation.
In New York, however, the gold price fell back on aggressive profit-taking
ahead of the Independence Day weekend. The Comex August contract fell
Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 386.70 after touching Dollars 393.60.
'All gold activity is being caused by New York futures markets and the
speculative funds,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of
Switzerland. 'There is no demand for gold bullion at these prices,
particularly in the Far East.'
Nevertheless, Sir James will be pleased with his campaign. The publicity he
gave to his sale of Newmont shares to financier Mr George Soros in April
revived the gold market. He used some of the proceeds from Mr Soros's funds
to buy call options, helping to push up the gold price which in January was
languishing at a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce. He sold more
Newmont shares and the price rallied.
Analysts suggest that, if he used only half the Dollars 440m (Pounds
293.30m) he can expect from the next sale of Newmont shares to buy more
options, it would push the gold price through the psychologically-important
Dollars 400 level.
Meanwhile, the Newmont share price, which normally would have fallen because
9.65m shares are on offer, instead improved by Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57
1/8 at the close of New York trading yesterday. Sir James bought his shares
for Dollars 39 each. When the next sale is completed, he will have reduced
his Newmont holding from about 45 per cent to only 5 per cent.
Some analysts warned of the dangers inherent in a speculative gold rally.
'At what point do the funds turn from buyers to sellers?' one asked.

FT  03 JUL 93 / EC argues over Pounds 121bn aid package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 12 European Community member states were last night at odds over how to
divide up the Ecu157bn (Pounds 121bn) structural aid and regional
development budget for 1994-99.
As each country tried to secure more EC funds, the larger states also
launched an assault on the European Commission's right to decide how money
for the Community's industrially stricken regions is allocated.
Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, which this week took over the
EC presidency, said that 'either we reach a timely decision, or we betray
our jobless and break the promises of Edinburgh', where EC heads of
government decided on the development package last December.
Ireland and the Netherlands threatened to block any agreement on disbursing
what is the largest amount of development aid in EC history unless they
received guarantees on the share they are seeking.
Germany, Italy and the four poorest member states - Spain, Portugal, Greece
and Ireland - also insisted that the eligibility threshold for Objective 1,
which includes the most deprived regions, be held at 75 per cent of average
per capita EC income.
These regions will get Ecu96.3bn, plus the Ecu15.5bn Cohesion Fund, which is
for the four poorest countries, on the most flexible terms reserved for the
Community's most backward areas.
The Commission wants Objective 1 status for Merseyside and the Scottish
Highlands and Islands in the UK, Hainaut in southern Belgium, and Cantabria
in northern Spain, even though they are above the 75 per cent limit.
This will almost certainly be approved, to preserve a 1988 political deal
making Northern Ireland and Corsica eligible for the most generous funding.
Since then, Corsica has effectively set a new eligibility benchmark, by
raising its per capita income to 79 per cent of the EC average. The areas
proposed by the Commission are just inside this.
But Germany, by far the largest net contributor to the EC budget now, wants
allocations on a strictly proportional per capita basis. Its eastern Lander
 -or states - where average income is around half the EC poorhouse
threshold, would thus get much more.
Germany, France and the UK were also seeking to deny the Commission the
right to decide on 'Objective 2' areas - those regions in industrial
decline. In addition the UK was blocking Brussels' plans to spend part of
the package's money for training the unemployed on retraining workers still
in jobs but in danger of losing them because of industrial restructuring.
The UK also wanted tight limits on the amount Brussels allocates to
Community-wide programmes, like those to revive former coal and steel areas,
even though the UK has been a principal beneficiary.
Among those yesterday volunteering the share they intended to take away were
Spain (Ecu40bn); Ireland (IPounds 8bn); and the Netherlands (about Ecu3bn).
The UK appeared to be aiming at around Ecu6bn.

FT  03 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The postponement of Qantas's flotation highlights the clouds of uncertainty
swirling around British Airways' strategy of buying minority shareholdings
in foreign airlines. Given the highly politicised nature of the industry, BA
may always struggle to exert control over such investments, which raises
doubts about whether they will ever generate adequate returns. The
Australian government's reshuffle of its privatisation priorities has
ensured Qantas will not now be floated until late next year. This creates
further confusion. It also delays the day BA will receive a dividend income
from its 25 per cent stake, bought at a cost of Pounds 304m.
Much attention has focused on BA's controversial Pounds 198m investment in
USAir. Doubts have been raised about whether BA can forge sufficiently close
links to justify the price paid. But at least USAir's preference shares
yield a fixed income. Besides, BA is already showing a fair paper profit on
its holding. It may take far longer for Qantas to show its worth. The
carrier should eventually derive benefits from integrating Australian
Airlines. It should also see good profits uplift once the lousy airline
market improves. BA's shareholders who stumped up Pounds 442m to bankroll
BA's global ambitions must certainly hope as much.

FT  03 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's three biggest grocery chains have cause for complaint with Asda.
Not only does the once-struggling retailer have the temerity to cling to
existence, hampering their imperial designs. It then proceeds to utter
bearish noises about the industry's future, jangling nerves and share prices
throughout the sector. If Asda's revival continues at its present pace, then
Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway may have even more reason to be upset. Revamped
Asda stores and an expanding Dales discount chain could provide far stiffer
competition in the low growth, low inflation environment of the 1990s.
But it would not do to get so swept up in the excitement, as Asda's share
price has done this year. Much of the recovery rests with the belief that
Asda can lift its 4 per cent margins closer to the 8 per cent achieved by
the big three. Yet this supposition may be suspect should Asda's predictions
prove correct. If the industry's margins do subside as price competition
sharpens, it will be all the more difficult for Asda to fight the trend.
This year Asda will only make modest earnings progress as it refurbishes 40
stores. The critical test will then be how successfully it spends its Pounds
347m rights issue money to re-ignite sales growth in future. A share rating
matching Sainsbury's takes a lot on trust when so much is still unproven.
Investors may do better to favour those second tier stocks, such as Wm
Morrison, Iceland or Shoprite, where continued growth prospects are more
assured.

FT  03 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Rentokil/Securiguard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There must have been little doubt after Rentokil's 345p offer that
Securiguard would sue for peace. Less certain is that Rentokil needed to
offer quite so much to tip the balance in its favour. It may have felt
Securiguard could drive a hard bargain because its shares are concentrated
in the hands of relatively few institutions. If so, it will also have to
live with a reputation for being a soft touch. That will not help in future
acquisitions or calm worries that it is growing anxious about its ability to
maintain its 20 per cent earnings growth.
Rentokil's answer that the total Pounds 76m purchase price is paltry in
comparison with its market capitalisation of Pounds 2bn is not entirely
satisfactory. It has drawn attention to itself with so much huffing and
puffing over what ought to have been a pretty easy prey. Also, the deal
involves a Pounds 40m goodwill write-off while Rentokil has a net worth of
only Pounds 146m. There is limited room for more goodwill hits if large
contested takeovers are now needed to maintain earnings momentum - on which
coincidentally the chief executive's remuneration depends.
In the short-run the acquisition should not prove dilutive. In the medium
term everything depends on whether Rentokil can bolster the margins of
Securiguard's security division and expand the business. Paradoxically
yesterday's offer document does not help its case. It points out that price
competition in security is now intense. Perhaps that is why, before Rentokil
came along, Securiguard's shares were languishing at a level not much more
than half the price it is now set to pay.

FT  03 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Gilts have the edge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those many City pundits who thought that equities would outperform gilts
this year must be growing nervous. In the first half, long gilts offered a
total return of some 10 per cent, the FT-A All-Share index little more than
seven. There is not much sign there of the boost to equities from growth
inspired by devaluation and low interest rates - or of the threat to gilts
from the government's borrowing requirement. Indeed the two markets seem
recently to have shown an even more diverging trend.
One explanation is that growth around the world is turning out disappointing
while the forces of disinflation are stronger than many earlier thought. It
is not just that the OECD is now forecasting growth of only 1.2 per cent for
the industrial world this year. Oil prices are falling, and yesterday's weak
US employment figures point to a faltering recovery. Such an environment
seems made for bond markets.
Arguably, the UK ought to be an exception. Its growth rate will stand out
among its European peers this year, but the OECD's expectation of 1.8 per
cent is hardly that impressive. Some equity investors have evidently been
prepared to bet on recovery. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index which is heavily
weighted towards cyclical stocks has outperformed the FT-SE 100 by a
striking margin so far in 1993. Arguably, too, the latter has been dragged
down by special situations, notably the US-inspired worries on healthcare
stocks. But even the most determined optimist will be hard put to discern
the earnings recovery which should underpin UK equity valuations. Until it
arrives equities will have little incentive to make up lost ground,
especially now sterling is strong and the government has set its sights
against a further cut in interest rates.

FT  03 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles on weak June jobs
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices tumbled across the board yesterday in the wake of a
surprisingly weak June employment report, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.57 at 3,483.97.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index ended 3.14 lower at
445.88, while the Amex composite finished down 0.60 at 435.27, and the
Nasdaq composite up 0.88 at 704.47.
Trading volume on the NYSE was relatively light ahead of the long holiday
weekend and totalled 214m shares.
Prices dropped from the opening, as investors registered their unhappiness
with the June jobs data. Although the rise in the national unemployment
rate, from 6.9 per cent to 7.0 per cent, had been expected, the meagre
increase of 13,000 in non-farm payrolls - the key component of the report -
was a big disappointment. Analysts had forecast that payrolls would rise
between 100,000 and 150,000.
Although the April and May payroll numbers were revised upwards, a fact
which slightly blunted the negative impact of the June figures, the data
provided further evidence that the US economy is growing extremely slowly,
and that the condition of the labour market is far from healthy.
At least Treasury prices drew strength from the jobs figures, with the
benchmark 30-year bond rising by a quarter of a point to 105 15/16 , and the
yield dropping to 6.66 per cent. The rise in bonds helped restrict the
losses in equities, although the Dow took a relatively big hit as leading
cyclicals stocks ran into early selling.
Among the declining cyclicals, Aluminum Company of America slipped Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 71 1/2 , International Paper Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 64 1/2 ,
Caterpillar Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 73 1/8 and Georgia-Pacific Dollars  5/8
to Dollars 60 3/8 .
Drug stocks were also under fire. Pfizer dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63
3/8 , Merck fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 34 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb eased
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 56 5/8 and Schering-Plough gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 67 3/8 .
IBM dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 48 1/8 in busy trading on reports that
the company will take a Dollars 2bn charge in the second quarter to pay for
workforce reductions.
General Electric bucked the market trend, rising Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 95
1/2 after the company predicted record earnings for the second quarter, and
said that it would be taking a charge to cover accounting changes.
TJX tumbled Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 in volume of 1.9m shares after
broking house First Manhattan downgraded the retail group's stock from 'buy'
to 'hold'.
Canada
TORONTO closed firmer in moderate trading, as gold stocks soared in response
to the surge in world gold prices.
According to preliminary figures, the composite index closed at 3,997.72, up
31.35 points, or 0.79%, from Wednesday's close. The market was closed on
Thursday for Canada Day. The index's overall gain for the holiday-shortened
week was about 6 points.
Volume was 62.9m shares, down from Wednesday's 78.6m.

rise in gold stocks

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS that a new stock futures contract based on a 350 issue price index
will replace the Nikkei 225 futures in November prompted a fall in the
futures markets and share prices lost ground on arbitrage selling, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gave up 303.15, or 1.5 per cent, to 19,621.46, barely
changed on the week. The index hit the day's high of 19,932.19 just after
the opening, but soon lost ground, falling to the day's low of 19,561.06
during the afternoon session.
Volume remained below 300m shares for the eighth consecutive day at 230m
shares against 231m. Declines led advances by 685 to 286 with 183 unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 12.00 to 1,586.03 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 3.25 to 1201.59.
Insolvency at Nikkatsu had already been discounted into share prices, said
traders, and had little effect on the market. The movie producer and
distributor, which filed for court protection under the bankruptcy law on
Thursday, was transferred to the liquidation post yesterday, ahead of its
delisting in October. Nikkatsu, a component stock of the Nikkei 225 ,will be
replaced by Shionogi, the pharmaceutical company.
Nikkatsu came under heavy selling pressure yesterday, and closed at an
offered price of Y149. Shionogi gained strongly on heavy buying, closing up
Y65 to Y1,050 in active volume.
Rohm, the integrated circuit maker, which announced on Wednesday that its US
subsidiary had won a patent for flash memory chips, once again failed to
trade and closed at a bid price of Y3,210.
Broadcasting companies were higher on reports that Fuji Television Network,
a leading television and radio network, was planning to list its shares.
Tokyo Broadcasting System rose Y20 to Y1,410 and Nippon Television Network
gained Y100 to Y19,200.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 155.89 to 21,763.23 in volume of 14.1m
shares.
Roundup
THE rise in the price of bullion provided an impetus to some of the region's
markets yesterday.
AUSTRALIA moved higher on buying of gold stocks after a sharp increase in
the bullion price. The gold index advanced 143 to a new five-and-a-half-year
record of 2,104.0 while the All Ordinaries index improved 13.6 to 1,768.9,
up 4 per cent on the week.
Turnover was strong at Dollars 438.5m. Among gold stocks, Newcrest Mining
surged 45 cents to ADollars 4.75 and Plutonic 30 cents to ADollars 6.40.
Commonwealth Bank rose 6 cents to ADollars 8.76 ahead of the government's
announcement after the close that it will bring forward the sale of a 19 per
cent stake.
HONG KONG was divided over how to interpret talks between Mr Chris Patten,
the governor, and the UK government which took place in London on Thursday.
The Hang Seng index put on 12.55 to 7,217.93, a week's gain of 2.9 per cent.
Turnover was HKDollars 4.7bn.
News that Mr Zhu Rongji, the Chinese vice-premier, had taken on the
additional post of governor of China's Central Bank came after the market
closed. Some analysts commented that the appointment could mean that China
will move to control the sharp growth in bank credit.
NEW ZEALAND rose to its highest level since May 1990 in hectic post-budget
trading. The NZSE-40 index closed up 12.58 at 1,699.07, a week's rise of 2.6
per cent. Turnover was a strong NZDollars 60.4m.
Brokers noted that the rally had been driven by lower domestic interest
rates and the fact that no tax changes were proposed in the budget. Fletcher
Challenge gained 6 cents to NZDollars 2.92.
BANGKOK was stronger on interest in speculative issues. The SET index rose
10.40 to 887.92, down 1 per cent on the week. Turnover was Bt6.95bn.

FT  03 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Dramatic gearing for UK holdings in
Japan - The appreciation of the yen has combined with the climb in Tokyo
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the wonderful benefit of hindsight, it is easy to see that a prime
buying opportunity existed at this time last year. Investors had become
totally despairing of Japan.
Equities had fallen almost 60 per cent from their December 1989 high and
still appeared to be in free-fall. And the Dollars 32bn pumped into the
Japanese market by foreign investors during the previous 12 months was
beginning to be recognised as good money thrown after bad.
Those adventurous investors have had their reward. The Tokyo market is up by
only 29 per cent on a year ago, and consequently is still some 45 per cent
below that 1989 high. But this is a lot better than most other markets.
The cream has come, however, in the form of the added currency contribution.
Over the past year the yen has risen by 18 per cent against the dollar and
by 50 per cent against sterling. This has resulted in a sterling total
return from Japan of 96 per cent and a dollar equivalent return of 54 per
cent.
Confining the statistics to the first six months of 1993 shows that Japan is
certainly on track to dominate fund performances this year. Europe has
produced a reasonably solid performance, but Wall Street has done little
more than tread water.
The net result has been a total return on the FT-A World Index of 17 per
cent in sterling terms and 16 per cent in dollar terms.
The implication of this first half outcome is that UK-based pension funds
will have been struggling to keep up with any indices.
On the home front, the rise of 3 1/2 per cent in the UK component of the
World Index conceals a gain of just 2 per cent by the top 100 companies, but
a gain of 16 per cent by the rest of the market.
This divergence within the UK market is an industry-, as well as a
size-effect. The divergence began on Black (Golden?) Wednesday in September
last year when the UK suspended its membership of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism. Investors have been chasing the cyclical stocks and sectors
higher ever since, scenting the possibility of some economic recovery
following the collapse in sterling and the decline in interest rates.
Contrarian investors who built up overweight holdings in these areas earlier
in 1992 have a right to feel smug. The sterling performances achieved by the
overseas portions of the UK-based funds are likely to have been very
diverse.
The combination of an overweight position in continental Europe and an
underweighting in North America will have served to improve performance
relative to the FT-A World ex-UK index.
Offsetting this, of course, will be the typically underweight position in
Japan.
The main determinant for many funds will be the extent to which their
exposure to other Far Eastern markets, which tends to be far higher than the
index, has compensated for Japan.
Those investors caught short in Japan are probably heaving a sigh of relief
now that the political and economic scene is frozen, pending the outcome of
the election later this month.
The consensus view seems to be that the market and currency will follow
suit, and do little until some of the uncertainties are removed.
In fact, most international investors appear to have resigned themselves to
a dull second half to the year. There are no signs of the froth which
accompanies bull peaks, but neither are there bargains in obvious abundance.
All eyes will be on Wall Street for signs of any definite trend. US stock
ratings are high by historical standards but, nevertheless, they can be
justified by the interest rate background and the low returns available on
alternative, domestic assets.
The problem comes, as it will come shortly, when interest rates start to
rise out of their recent trough. Indeed, there is every likelihood that the
pattern of previous presidential cycles will be repeated: the need for a
tightening in both monetary and fiscal policies following a pre-election
period of considerable easing. This implies an equity market correction in
the not too distant future.
Investors in the UK market also have to face up to the fact that an interest
rate trough could well have been reached. It could be late into next year,
however, before the consequences of rising interest rates have to be faced
again, assuming that inflation continues to behave itself in the meantime.
The main risk to the market in the short term is that ambitious expectations
for a sharp earnings recovery fail to be met. With the market on a rating
last seen in mid-1987, investors in the UK market are already taking a lot
on trust.
Most of the rest of Europe lags some way behind the US and the UK in terms
of the economic cycle and so the imponderables are even greater. The current
year prospects for Germany, in particular, are still the subject of sharp
downgradings and any renewed growth in 1994, if it occurs at all, it is
expected to be modest.
On the face of it, therefore, it looks like the second half of the year is
going to be quiet. There are no obvious big opportunities; just early signs
of potential pitfalls. But, no doubt, contrarian investors would argue that
such widespread malaise is a sure indicator of dramatic market behaviour to
come.

FT  03 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses incline lower as
profit-taking takes hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the Bundesbank's interest rate action already discounted, and almost
pre-digested, bourses waited for the US June jobs data and were duly
depressed, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was an apparent exception, the 8.82 fall in the DAX to 1,697.81
over the official session leaving it a fraction higher on the week and only
a shade lower than it ended in the post-bourse on Thursday.
This was considered quite reasonable, given scope for profit-taking after
recent gains in equities, and the fall in the bond market where the
Bundesbank's average bond yield rose by 4 basis points to 6.53 per cent.
Turnover eased from DM6.6bn to DM6.2bn, but Mr Patrick Bettscheider, equity
dealing head at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that the bank  - which
has the DAX on a 1993 p/e of 16.8 - saw strong US demand for scrip, and that
foreign demand for German equities had been a feature of its business over
the past six weeks.
Cyclicals continued to lose ground with the automotive and industrial group,
Daimler-Benz, down DM8.80, or 1.4 per cent to DM606.50.
But Continental, the tyremaker, rose 50 pfg to DM212.50 after saying that it
had made a profit in the first five months of the current year, in spite of
a 10 per cent drop in sales.
PARIS had already discounted the 25 basis point cut in the intervention rate
and the CAC-40 index drifted lower on pre-weekend profit-taking. It closed
down 19.00 at 1,941.15, off 1 per cent on the week.
Peugeot managed a rise of FFr6 to FFr585, having announced a 5 per cent fall
in June sales.
The weaker oil price depressed Total, off FFr5.50 at FFr274.00 while Elf, ex
a FFr13 dividend, finished down a net FFr3.30 at FFr390.20.
Rhone-Poulenc, which is raising FFr4bn by issuing securities to reduce
short-term debt, put on FFr9 to FFr585.
MILAN remained extremely active in telecommunications stocks ahead of
privatisation, while Olivetti joined the list of positively performing
stocks, rising L110 to L1,595.
Strength in these sectors offset continued weakness in Fiat, following a bad
earnings forecast this week, down Ll20 at L6,140, a fall of 2.5 per cent
over the week. The group yesterday announced plans to raise L2,000bn from a
syndicated loan.
The Comit index finished up 3.28 at 538.06, up 0.7 per cent on the week. The
market's attention was also directed to progress in the wage talks, with the
government setting a deadline of today for agreement. Some analysts believe
that a further cut in domestic interest rates remains conditional on a deal
being achieved.
Among the telecoms stocks, Stet gained L30 to L3,650 and Sip L38 to L2,689.
AMSTERDAM moved modestly lower, with the CBS Tendency index down 0.2 at
112.5, a week's gain of 0.9 per cent. Polygram moved to a year's high, up Fl
1.10 at Fl 53.90, while Philips lost 20 cents to Fl 30.10.
BRUSSELS fell on profit-taking although the BFr20 drop to BFr1,264 in the
retailer, Delhaize, reflected disappointing half-year results from its US
unit, Food Lion.
The Bel-20 index ended 10.10 lower at 1,282.26, up 1.3 per cent on the week,
in turnover of BFr1.3bn.
VIENNA dropped 1.5 per cent after Thursday's smaller than expected,
quarter-point cut in Austrian interest rates, the ATX index ending 12.58
lower at 840.00.
ISTANBUL gained 5.8 per cent on expectations that the new cabinet would win
approval. Activity was concentrated in state-run companies which are
privatisation candidates. The index gained 649 to 11,794.7.

FT  03 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gloomy Asda hits retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEARISH remarks on the food retail market by the chief executive of Asda
sent the company's shares downward and cast further gloom on the medium-term
outlook for the sector. Food retailing analysts warned that a welter of
downgrades were likely to add more downward pressure to the sector in the
coming weeks, as the market takes the Asda chief's caution on board.
Mr Archie Norman said that the 'halcyon days' for the UK food retailing
industry were now over, with a decline in growth and the industry facing
increasing overcapacity.
During the next five years, margins would come under further pressure, as
the leading supermarket chains attempted to remain competitive with new
discount retailers.
'Archie has really stuck the knife in,' said one gloomy specialist. 'The
sector is totally friendless.' The remarks took the shine off good results
from Asda, which reported profits of Pounds 142.1m, following a loss last
year of Pounds 364.8m.
Despite this, Asda shares slumped nearly 10 per cent, dropping 6 to 65 1/2 p
in hefty turnover of 41m, with a further 8m equivalent being traded in the
options market.
Disappointment in the group's operating margins compared with its main
rivals was also being expressed in the market, raising doubts as to whether
the stock will retain its premium rating.
Among other retailers, J Sainsbury slid 12 to 467p, Tesco dipped 4 to 211p
and Argyll declined 8 to 317p.

FT  03 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures selling drives equities lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S equity market relinquished all and more of the hard-won gains
realised earlier in the week as bad news on both the political and economic
fronts combined to weaken all of the big international equity markets.
London was one of the worst performers among the big markets, with the FT-SE
100 index closing 31.1, or 1.1 per cent, down on the session at 2,857.7,
mirroring the retreat by Wall Street during early trading.
Lingering market hopes that Thursday's Europe-wide interest rate cuts, might
well be followed by a reduction in UK rates, came to nothing and helped to
demoralise a UK equity market already suffering from end-account selling.
Sentiment was further weakened when more bad economic news emerged from the
US, where non-farm payrolls increased by only 13,000, well below the
expected 175,000 and prompting increasing worries among market-watchers
about the faltering US economy.
The only real comfort for the market came from a gilts arena still
performing well despite the outcome of the mid-week gilts auction, at which
the Pounds 3.25bn-worth of stock was subscribed for only 1.1 times.
Long-dated gilts, helped by a good showing by sterling, were never under
pressure and closed about  1/8 higher, while index-linked were about  3/16
firmer, ahead of the Bank of England's announcement of another Pounds 300m
of index-linked stock.
The last trading session of the two-week account began with the market
opening more than 8 points lower, reflecting an early decline in the FT-SE
100 future. The latter was on the retreat throughout a busy session,
eventually closing at a hefty discount to the cash market, indicating that
next week will see the market off to a poor start.
Sentiment never recovered after the weak opening and the FT-SE 100 moved
progressively lower to close only fractionally above the day's lowest point,
2,857.0, or down 31.8, reached when Wall Street was showing a 25-point
decline.
The FT-SE Mid 250 delivered a more robust showing, closing 6.9 off at
3,234.8, having hit peak levels on the previous four days.
Turnover was 638.7m shares, down on Thursday's 650m, but above recent
average levels. Customer business on Thursday was worth Pounds 1.4bn.
Food retailing stocks were hit by Asda's claim of 'difficult trading', but
electricity stocks celebrated the run of big dividend increases.

FT  03 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures plunged to a discount to cash for the first time in
recent sessions with its 2,900 resistance level smashed, Christine Buckley
writes.
The September contract reeled from end-of-account trading, a poor Wall
Street opening and general gloom over Europe's economic picture. It closed
at 2859, down 21 on its opening, with 8,837 contracts traded. Its estimated
fair value premium to cash trailed 9.7 points.
The downward drift was relentless, as institutional investors who had been
bullish recently felt the cue to exit. A further body blow was dealt late in
the day when 1,000 contracts were sold by an independent trader.
An uncertain opening on Monday is feared.
Large volume in traded options was triggered by the FT-SE and Asda. The
FT-SE 100 option bounced by more than 9,000 lots to 14034, largely shaped by
August 2,900 calls on fears of market volatility. Total volume was 52,050
with 8,797 lots in Asda on the back of results.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Money Markets: France cuts rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was more rate-cut activity in the money markets yesterday after France
belatedly followed up Thursday's half-point cut in the German discount rate
with a  1/4 point cut in its own intervention rate, writes Rachel Johnson.
As it now stands at 6.75 per cent (compared with a German floor of 6.75 per
cent in its discount rate), traders expect there will be room for France to
ease further over the summer.
A cut in the German repurchase rate would be a useful cue for another French
easing, dealers noted. As the French franc weakened against the D-Mark
during the day, it is unlikely that another easing will come soon. The Bank
of Spain also cut its daily intervention rate by  1/4 point to 11 per cent.
Dealings in the London money market combined to suggest that the UK would,
for the moment, not participate in the latest round of European-wide
interest rate cuts. The Bank of England gave assistance at its established
rate of 5 29/32 (just a shade below the base rate), offering Pounds 325m to
relieve an estimated sizeable Pounds 1.2bn shortage in an early round. The
main factors determining the liquidity shortage were the take-up of Treasury
Bills and paper maturing in official hands which would drain Pounds 1.17bn
from the system.
After two further rounds of assistance of Pounds 331m and Pounds 95m, the
shortage had not yet been taken care of by the afternoon, and the Bank was
required to supply a further Pounds 420m (taking the day's assistance up to
Pounds 1.17bn) in a late round. Money rates remained virtually unchanged
during the day, with the three month interbank rate closing at 5 7/8 , after
a previous 5 5/16 , for technical rather than fundamental reasons.
But with the Government's funding programme going well, and the prospect of
tax increases raised by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, traders are still
assuming that some monetary loosening might be forthcoming.
German call money rates slipped after the Thursday rate cuts, to 7.65 per
cent after 7.82 per cent on Thursday.
Outside Europe, there was a report that Canada tried to help a further
easing of monetary conditions in April; and gloom about the US economy
gathered pace after the release of disappointing non-farm payroll data.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar weathers data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING yesterday was dominated by the release of the US non-farm payroll
data, which rose just 13,000 in June against analysts' expectation of a rise
ten times that size, writes Rachel Johnson.
The news hit the dollar briefly but the currency did not take long to revive
as traders continued to target the Yen and the D-Mark as the currencies to
shed ahead of next week's meeting of the G7 in Tokyo.
As the US figures were much worse than expected, the question of whether the
Federal Reserve's next monetary move should be to ease policy rather than
the reverse began to preoccupy market participants. 'All the data -
including the consumer sentiment survey from Michigan University - has been
low, pointing to a different complexion for Fed policy,' said Mr Mark
Hilliard, at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
With bearish sentiment aimed elsewhere, the dollar reversed its initial drop
 -to the confusion of those who assumed that the poor economic data would
drive down the currency for longer. Analysts reasoned that this was because
the G7 meeting would produce little to celebrate in terms of a GATT
breakthrough or concrete measures to boost world growth and employment.
Speculation that the Bank of Japan would be forced to cut rates under G7
pressure to revive the locomotive economies caused the sharpest currency
movement of the day. The Yen closed at Y108.75 to the dollar, after Y107.40
the previous day. But the fact that the Bundesbank had already done its bit
for world growth by cutting its rates on Thursday did nothing to improve the
sentiment surrounding the D-Mark, as the German economy remains in deep
recession. The D-Mark closed at DM1.6960 against the dollar, as against a
previous DM1.6990 on Thursday.
There was currency fall-out from the latest round of European interest rate
cuts. The Swiss franc suffered from sentiment that the Swiss Bank would like
to cut rates again; and the French cut coming as late as yesterday caused
confusion. Many had expected the Bank of France to ease on Monday, and were
again caught out by the fact that the French did not ease after the
Bundesbank's move on Thursday. Franc weakness was the result yesterday, with
the currency closing at FFr3.383 against the D-Mark, after a previous 3.377.
According to one economist, the Franc weakness was not so much the result of
the lowering of the intervention rate as a perception in the markets that
another quarter-point rate cut from the Bank of France was just a matter of
time.

FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fiat sets up loan to cushion
heavy spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, will sign a L2,000bn (Dollars 1.29bn)
stand-by loan next week to bolster its finances at a time of large-scale
spending.
The deal, to be led by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, will come in
two tranches of L1,000bn covering maturities of 18 months and five years.
Terms for the transaction and the names of the banks involved will be
revealed next week.
The new facility will provide an extra cushion to meet the needs of the
group's L46,000bn investment programme between 1992 and 1996.
About L28,000bn of the total is being spent on the cars side, where Fiat has
announced a new model programme. Investment spending on cars will use a
further L12,000bn between 1997 and 1999, while the company may also announce
further spending during that period for other industrial activities.
Fiat's investments have already had a big impact on finances. Its net
financial position, which surged to a deficit of L3,849bn at the end of
1992, could reach L10,000bn by end-December.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, has said Fiat would try to alleviate the
effect of continued heavy investments by selling non-strategic assets.

FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: MIM to buy UK zinc smelter for
ADollars 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIM, the Australian mining and metals group, is to buy the UK's only zinc
smelter, at Avonmouth, near Bristol, and associated downstream businesses in
the West Midlands, for ADollars 100m (USDollars 67m).
Pasminco, the financially-stretched rival Australian zinc producer, put the
smelter up for sale in February last year after reporting a net loss of
ADollars 118m.
The deal takes MIM into zinc smelting for the first time, although it has
copper and lead smelting facilities. The group produces about 20 per cent of
the world's mixed lead/zinc concentrate (an intermediate material) and this
will go up to almost 50 per cent when its planned MacArthur River zinc mine
in Australia comes into operation in the late 1990s.
Consequently, the Avonmouth smelter had a unique value to MIM, said Mr
Norman Fussell, MIM's managing director, yesterday.
'MIM's strategies include growth in zinc production as one of our core
products,' he said. 'We seek to build upon our Australian base into the
three major market areas of the world of which the UK/Europe is one.'
The Avonmouth plant, which has an annual capacity of 105,000 tonnes of zinc
and 45,000 tonnes of lead, is the largest in the world using the Imperial
Smelting Process, the most suitable technology available for processing the
mixed concentrates MacArthur River will produce, he added. A production
improvement programme is expected to lift capacity to 120,000 tonnes of zinc
and 55,000 tonnes of lead.
MIM is also buying the associated Bloxwich facility which makes a range of
products using zinc from Avonmouth and other European smelters and does some
recycling.
MIM has been operating in the UK for many years through ownership of the
Britannia Refined Metals silver-lead refinery at Northfleet, Kent.
It will pay USDollars 67m, subject to adjustment for actual working capital,
plus up to Pounds 3.9m (USDollars 5.85m) for a capital expenditure
adjustment.
Pasminco said the consideration would consist of USDollars 15m cash, with
the balance in negotiable promissory notes. Funds would be applied to
reducing Pasminco's debt and the deal would result in a book loss of about
ADollars 6m.
Pasminco, formed in 1988 when North Broken Hill Peko and CRA pooled their
zinc and lead interests, originally wanted to sell all its European
operations to reduce debt and concentrate on its Australian operations.
However, it decided to keep its 50 per cent share of the Budelco smelter in
the Netherlands, jointly owned with Billiton, the mining and metals arm of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Budelco's future is under a cloud because the
Dutch authorities are insisting it must treat its solid waste rather than
store it.

<TEXT>
STENA LINE, the Swedish ferry group, is to announce a radical change of
strategy next week which could involve ordering the world's first fleet of
high-speed ferries capable of carrying goods vehicles.
The company and its UK subsidiary, Stena Sealink Line, said they would make
an announcement on Tuesday that would have implications for the world's
ferry industry.
There was speculation this could mean ordering craft technically ahead of
high-speed ferries such as the catamarans operated by Sea Containers, the
Bermuda-based shipping group.

FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Continental 'satisfactory' if
market conditions hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL, the German tyre manufacturer, is on course for 'satisfactory'
results this year provided there is no deterioration in market conditions
later this year, the chief executive said yesterday.
Mr Hubertus von Grunberg told shareholders in Hanover that the group managed
to make a profit in the first five months of the year although sales fell by
10 per cent to DM3.7bn (Dollars 2.18bn).
Mr von Grunberg blamed the decline in turnover on low unit sales to the
recession-hit car industry, but cited a number of factors which were working
in the group's favour.
These include a continued recovery in earnings at General Tire, the group's
US subsidiary, as well as the swift implementation of rationalisation
measures which had enabled the group to avoid the full force of the
downturn.
These measures would be intensified during the rest of the year. Mr von
Grunberg said Continental was considering transferring production away from
high cost manufacturing sites in western Europe to other parts of the world.
Continental made net profits of DM133m last year after a loss of DM128.2m in
1991. The recovery disguises poor conditions in the second half of last year
when the group made virtually no profit. Mr von Grunberg earlier this year
described the first two months of 1993 as 'miserable'.

FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Further write-offs expected at
IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM is expected to announce another big write-off to cover further workforce
cuts when it reports its second-quarter results later this month.
The US computer company, still struggling to recover from its worst ever
sales slump, will also provide an updated estimate of the number of jobs it
expects to eliminate this year.
Financial analysts are predicting that IBM could double its original
projection of 25,000 job reductions for 1993. 'We expect a write-off of at
least Dollars 1.8bn to Dollars 2.4bn for an additional 15,000 to 20,000
personnel reductions above the 25,000 estimate given last December,' said Mr
John Jones of Salomon Brothers. Asset write-offs could increase the
write-off by another Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn, Mr Jones predicted.
IBM declined to comment on published estimates of job cuts, but reiterated
earlier statements that the final reduction figures for the year were
expected to be well above 25,000.
Mr Lou Gerstner, new IBM chairman and chief executive, who joined the
company on April 1, is expected to take a more aggressive approach than his
predecessor, Mr John Akers, toward reducing costs.
Last year, IBM reduced its workforce by over 40,000, to about 300,000, down
from a high of 405,000 at the end of 1985. Faced with large write-offs for
redundancies, IBM may again reduce its dividend, some analysts believe.

FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Montedison triggers new losses
inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONTEDISON, the Italian industrial group controlled by the troubled Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, has brought in a second set of
accountants to investigate mysterious losses at a little-known foreign
subsidiary.
The disclosure of the losses at Financing and Investments, a Curacao
subsidiary of Montedison's Swiss-based international holding company,
resulted in a last-minute revision of the group's accounts this week to show
an additional L435bn (Dollars 281m) consolidated loss on top of the L1,244bn
previously reported.
Separately, shares in Ferfin, which have plunged since the group shocked
shareholders at the end of May with much higher-than-expected losses for
1992, fell a further 6.52 per cent to L381.6 in Milan yesterday. The latest
drop takes the cumulative fall in Ferfin's ordinary share price to over 64
per cent since its original 1992 results were announced.
Montedison, which this week elected a new board largely comprising
appointees acceptable to Ferfin's five main creditor banks, said it had
called on the Deloitte &amp; Touche accounting group to examine where and how
the losses arose.
The accountants have also been requested to examine the complex structure of
Montedison International Holding and its subsidiaries and of the foreign
subsidiaries of Ferfin.
Earlier this week, Montedison said it had called on its main auditors, Price
Waterhouse, to look into the unexplained losses, ascribed to 'credits deemed
to be irrecoverable'.
The appointment of additional auditors suggests the group wants an
independent study and may imply the scale of the task is more complex than
expected.
Magistrates are now looking into two aspects of Ferfin's affairs. While one
team in Milan is monitoring the proposed rescue, two separate sets of
magistrates in Milan and Rome are investigating possible irregularities in
the constitution and eventual dismantling of the Enimont chemicals joint
venture between Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals
group.
The latter inquiry has triggered rumours that Montedison's newly-discovered
losses could be linked to covert payments to Italian politicians in return
for Enimont-linked favours, along the lines of kickbacks paid by Eni.
Alternatively, some observers believe the losses cover previously concealed
errors in commodities or foreign exchange trading, or may have stemmed from
covert share support schemes when Ferfin and Montedison were engaged in a
stream of takeovers.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil raises Securiguard bid terms and
snaps up 29.7% stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENTOKIL, the environmental and property services company, yesterday lifted
its bid for security and cleaning group Securiguard and then bought 29.7 per
cent of the company in the market at the revised offer price.
Securiguard's board, which rejected Rentokil's earlier approach, said it
wanted to meet with Rentokil and consider recommending the revised bid.
Rentokil raised its cash offer from 270p a share to 345p, which includes
Securiguard's 4.5p interim dividend payable next month. The offer, which was
declared final, values Securiguard at Pounds 70.9m compared to its market
capitalisation before the offer of about Pounds 40m.
Securiguard's shares gained 25p to 340p. Analysts said Rentokil was offering
a 'very full' price and would probably win control of the target.
Mr Clive Thompson, Rentokil's chief executive, said the revised offer gave
shareholders more than 18 times last year's earnings. 'The reason we've paid
a very substantial premium is in order to realise opportunities in the
security market,' he said.
Rentokil wants to use Securiguard's UK and US manned security operations to
break into the security market, which it sees as a good fit with its other
business services like property management. Securiguard's cleaning
activities, expanded in 1990 through the purchase of Madison, could fit with
Rentokil's office cleaning activities.
Rentokil was less interested in Securiguard's other divisions,
communications and personnel, according to Mr Thompson, who said he would
consider Securiguard's offer of talks over the weekend.
Rentokil bought its stake from 12 institutions. It stopped buying just short
of the 30 per cent trigger, when it would have been forced to launch an
unconditional offer.
Securiguard, which gained a full listing in 1987, has seen its shares
under-perform since 1990 because of fears about the quality of its
management and business. Although it holds some high profile contracts, such
as providing security for New York's Kennedy airport, its cleaning division
is thought to be skewed towards low margin, local authority business.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Proposal to take Nu-Swift private as
profits decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Murray, the chairman and majority shareholder in Nu-Swift, is
seeking take the fire protection, office cleaning and property group private
through a share buy-out bid.
The privatisation proposal was revealed yesterday as Nu-Swift reported
sharply lower pre-tax profits for last year mainly reflecting a decrease in
valuation of the group's investment property portfolio.
Mr Murray owns a 66 per cent stake in Nu-Swift through European Fire
Protection, while Mr Michael Ashcroft's ADT holds 22.8 per cent of the
USM-quoted West Yorkshire-based group.
The shares closed 25p lower at 333p valuing the group at Pounds 123.9m and
the stake Mr Murray does not own at Pounds 42.5m.
The board is appointing an independent financial adviser 'to advise on a
proposal whereby all shareholders other than EFP and ADT would be offered
cash and/or loan notes' for their shares. ADT would receive cash, loan notes
and property assets.
Because of the discussions Mr Murray said Nu-Swift would not be paying a
dividend in respect of 1992 since the associated advance corporation tax
would not be recoverable in the foreseeable future and consequently the net
asset value of the group would be reduced by more than the dividend amount -
20p was paid for 1991.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 fell from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 14.1m on turnover
which slipped to Pounds 318.6m (Pounds 326.5m).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 16.1m resulted from the sale of National
Cleaning.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Asda - Chief
executive warns of difficult future for grocery market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the UK's fourth-largest grocery chain, continued its recovery with
pre-tax profits for the year to May 1 of Pounds 187.4m, after a Pounds
364.8m loss last year, but warned that the grocery market faced an
increasingly difficult future.
Asda's shares fell 6p to 65 1/2 p, and share prices fell across the food
retail sector as Mr Archie Norman, chief executive, said food retail growth
was in decline, industry overcapacity was increasing, and competition was
growing from cut-price discount operators.
'We are planning on the basis that the halcyon days in the UK grocery
industry in terms of profitability are over,' he said.
'1991 will turn out to have been the annus mirabilis of UK grocery
retailing. The superstore industry will not be able to sustain the number of
new openings planned without having some effect on margins and sales
growth.'
He added that Asda's achievement this year had been to improve its
performance in difficult circumstances and that the chain's renewed emphasis
on keen pricing made it well-placed to withstand the pressures on the
grocery industry.
The pre-tax figure, prepared under FRS 3, included exceptional credits of
Pounds 65.2m. There were profits on asset sales of Pounds 97.8m offset by a
Pounds 6m provision for restructuring the Allied Maples furnishing business,
which made a Pounds 7.9m operating loss last year, and a Pounds 26.6m
provision for losses on discontinued businesses, including the closure costs
of Asda's food processing plant in Wakefield.
Last year there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 451.6m.
On a non-FRS 3 basis, profits before tax and exceptional items increased 62
per cent to Pounds 140.4m (Pounds 86.8m). That was at the top end of City
forecasts, and in excess of Asda's own forecast of Pounds 130m when it
launched a Pounds 347m rights issue in February.
Group turnover improved to Pounds 4.61bn (Pounds 4.53bn). Turnover for the
Asda stores improved 2 per cent to Pounds 4.4bn (Pounds 4.31bn for a 53-week
year). On a 52-week basis, store turnover was up 4 per cent.
Stripping out the effects of four new stores, four conversions to the new
Dales discount format, and food price inflation of about 1 per cent,
like-for-like sales growth was about 2 per cent, better than that achieved
by Sainsbury, Safeway or Tesco.
FRS 3 earnings per share were 6.4p (17.55p losses), and the proposed final
dividend is 1.1p, making a total of 1.6p (2.1p).

<TEXT>
Shares in Quadramatic, a coin-handling and optical group which is being
floated with a market value of Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m, will be priced on
Wednesday.
The group is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer
which will raise Pounds 20m in new money to pay off debt. No existing
shareholders are selling shares.
Quadramatic is backed by Mr Tony Gartland and Mr Jeff Whalley, two
dealmakers who during the eighties expanded FKI, the electrical engineering
group, by turning round lossmaking companies. They want to build Quadramatic
by acquiring high-margin engineering companies with international
opportunities.
Quadramatic is forecast to make Pounds 4.5m in the year to September.
Private investors can apply for shares through intermediaries.

MR JACQUES Murray, the chairman and majority shareholder in Nu-Swift, is
seeking take the fire protection, office cleaning and property group private
through a share buy-out bid.
The privatisation proposal was revealed yesterday as Nu-Swift reported
sharply lower pre-tax profits for last year mainly reflecting a decrease in

Mr Murray owns a 66 per cent stake in Nu-Swift through European Fire
Protection, while Mr Michael Ashcroft's ADT holds 22.8 per cent of the
Yorkshire-based group which is quoted on the USM.
The shares closed 25p lower at 333p valuing the group at Pounds 123.9m and
the stake Mr Murray does not own at Pounds 42.5m.
Mr Murray said that following discussions between EFP and ADT, the board had
decided to appoint an independent financial adviser 'to advise on a proposal
whereby all shareholders other than EFP and ADT would be offered cash and/or
loan notes in consideration for their shares.'
At the same time he said ADT would receive cash, loan notes and property
assets, up to an equivalent value, for its stake in Nu-Swift. He added that
'shareholders will be kept informed as these discussions proceed.'
Because of the discussions Mr Murray said Nu-Swift would not be paying a
dividend in respect of 1992 since the associated advance corporation tax
would not be recoverable in the foreseeable future and consequently the net

Pre-tax profits for 1992 fell from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 14.1m on turnover
which slipped to Pounds 318.6m (Pounds 326.5m).
Mr Murray noted that 1992 had been 'a year of consolidation for the group
with only minor investment activity.' The group's service business
activities, then comprising the European fire protection division and the
American office cleaning and maintenance division which was sold at the
start of June, continued to make 'substantial' profits despite the
recessions in both the UK and the US.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 16.1m resulted from the sale of National
Cleaning.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: SFO raids in Butte and Richmond inquiries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office raided a number of addresses in and around
Stoke-on-Trent earlier this week in its investigations into a group of
quoted natural resources companies and a separate alleged advance fee fraud
which may extend to the US.
The SFO yesterday confirmed that it had searched, among others, the premises
of J Paterson Brodie &amp; Son, the Stoke-on-Trent accountants. The search was
carried out on Wednesday morning in conjunction with City of London and
Staffordshire police.
The SFO has stressed that the raid on J Paterson Brodie was not part of an
investigation into the accountants, but part of a wider inquiry. Several
private residences were also searched.
Police are believed to have confiscated documents concerning companies
linked with natural resource groups, Butte Mining and Richmond Oil &amp; Gas,
and Mr Charles Deacon, a Staffordshire solicitor.
They are also understood to have taken all correspondence and files
concerning the financial affairs of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands
entrepreneur who has been linked to the flotation of several natural
resource companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. J Paterson Brodie were
auditors and financial advisers to Mr Smith for more than a decade.
Mr Smith was active in the affairs of Butte Mining and held a stake in
Richmond Oil &amp; Gas. Most recently, he has received attention for his role in
backing the 1992 purchase of Alpine Double Glazing, the windows company
which recently collapsed.
The raid is the latest in a series which began in April last year with a
swoop by Jersey fraud police on the offices of local accountants, Bryant &amp;
Co. Documents uncovered there sparked a wide-ranging SFO inquiry into share
dealings and transactions in UK-quoted Richmond Oil and Butte Mining.
Since then the SFO has also raided the offices of Mr Deacon, who has had
dealings with at least one of the resource companies, in connection with
alleged advance fee frauds.
Sources close to Mr Deacon said they doubted whether there was any
connection between the SFO investigation into Richmond and Butte, and the
advance fee inquiry.
Mr Deacon, who has not practised as a solicitor since December, was declared
bankrupt in April, claiming debts of more than Dollars 254m (Pounds 169m).

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: In search of happy bellringers - Neil
Buckley reports on the plans of a revitalised retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE exit of one of Asda's newly-revamped stores at Wolstanton, near
Stoke, is a customer satisfaction bell. Shoppers are invited to 'ring the
bell and keep us smiling if you've had good service'.
Shareholders might already be ringing the bell for Asda's new management
team, headed by Mr Archie Norman. The severe financial difficulties the
chain found itself in at the end of the 1980s have been largely solved.
Net debt has been reduced from more than Pounds 700m when Mr Norman took
over, to Pounds 76m, helped by the sale of Asda's stake in MFI, the
furniture retailer, Pounds 57m of site disposals, and a Pounds 347m rights
issue.
Mr Norman has set a clear strategy of keeping the Asda chain to 200 stores
and redesigning and rebuilding existing stores.
The company has abandoned its disastrous late-1980s strategy of trying to be
another Sainsbury or Safeway. It is returning to its roots, aiming to
'satisfy the weekly shopping needs of ordinary working people and their
families'. The 'Asda Price' slogan has been revived, with the aim of beating
prices at Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco by 3 or 4 per cent.
The chain is also experimenting in four stores with a new discount format
called Dales.
The key to success will now be whether Asda can attract shoppers back to its
stores. It has already had some success. Like-for-like sales growth of 2 per
cent last year was better than any of the big three.
It is putting its hopes in its store renewal programme. Four stores have
already been refitted and 40 more will undergo the treatment this year, at a
cost of about Pounds 95m.
The five-year-old Asda at Wolstanton was the first example. Asda spent
Pounds 2.3m last August turning it from a somewhat dark and cluttered place
into a light and airy flagship, installing new lighting, signing, and
fittings.
It also moved fresh foods to the store entrance, replacing the bottles of
detergent and car accessories which used to greet shoppers.
As important as the physical changes were the managerial ones. Several
layers of management were removed and staff divided into 25 teams covering
different product areas. Each team runs its area as a business, and is given
weekly and daily sales figures, as well as information on items such as wage
and wastage costs.
The teams are experimenting with adjusting the product mix, and in many
cases reducing the range.
Mr Norman said yesterday he believed Asda, whose superstores used to carry
more than 20,000 product lines, had become 'over-ranged'. The total might be
reduced by as much as 20 per cent.
Wolstanton's management believes it has taken sales from nearby Tesco and
Sainsbury superstores, and Asda's four 'renewal' stores have seen sales
increase by about 20 per cent since their refits.
Mr Norman said he expected to see similar results from all 40 renewal stores
this year.
Forty minutes down the M6 is an example of the other prong in Asda's
programme.
At Tipton, a 20-year-old superstore has been converted into a Dales discount
outlet. Asda spent Pounds 2m on ripping out the false ceiling to create more
of a 'shed' environment, and installing warehouse shelving.
Dales carries only 7,000 lines, the margin structure is 'significantly
lower' than Asda, and prices are about 12 per cent lower than the big three
superstore operators. That puts prices on a similar level to those at Kwik
Save, the UK's largest discount food chain, but Dales has twice the range.
Again, emphasis is placed on fresh food, which accounts for about a third of
the range, and which many discount stores cut to a minimum because of the
high costs and special skills involved.
'You could argue that what we are doing (at Dales) is going back to Asda's
roots,' said Mr Paul Dowling, corporate affairs director. 'But we are trying
to make it classless. We want to put across the idea of good value without
festooning the roof with Day-glo signs.'
Dales' sober white-washed walls and airy feel may not accord with the
public's traditional view of discounting. Yet the format is showing promise.
Tipton is thought to have taken sales both from a nearby Kwik Save, and from
Tesco.
Volumes in the Dales conversions have increased significantly, and Asda
plans to open two new Dales this year in south-east England, one on a new
site at Sittingbourne, Kent, and one in a converted DIY superstore in
Hertfordshire. Eventually, Mr Norman said, Dales might provide the avenue
for the group's physical expansion. With saturation in the food market
increasing, the Asda format itself is unlikely to grow.
Once the renewal programme is complete, Asda will rely for profits growth on
constantly improving its performance, along the lines of Marks and Spencer,
rather than through constant expansion, like Sainsbury or Tesco.
It is an ambitious vision. Mr Archie Norman has yet to prove if he can
deliver, and keep that satisfaction bell ringing.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Investigation into sale of Greencore
completed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH stock exchange said yesterday that it had completed its
investigation into the controversial sale in April of the Irish government's
remaining stake in Greencore, the sugar group, by Dublin's leading
stockbroking firm Davy. It had reported its findings to the London Stock
Exchange.
Mr Leonard Abrahamson, president of the ISE, said it was now up to its
Professional Standards Panel 'to determine whether there is a case to
answer. If they do then they will make a submission to the disciplinary
committee'.
Six weeks ago, Mr Abrahamson said that the main findings of the ISE's
investigation would be published. He said yesterday, though, 'until the
process is complete it would not be appropriate to make anything public.'
The investigation has already taken a month longer than originally
anticipated. It has focused on several aspects of the placing including
Davy's original share placement arrangements with SG Warburg, the London
merchant bank, with whom Davy has said there was a profit-and-loss sharing
agreement. The arrangement was then abandoned on the day of the placement.
Warburg was to have taken up to 10m of the 25.4m shares on offer on a
buyer-of-last-resort basis. At the last moment Davy changed the arrangement
and placed the Warburg's block with parties associated with the Davy firm.
In the week following the placement, trading in Greencore shares was
suspended in London and Dublin for two days, after the Irish government said
it had been informed by Davy that legal problems with the placement might
have arisen.
The ISE then took the unusual step of making a public statement saying that
Greencore shares had been trading on the basis of 'misleading information'
following the placing and that the conduct of Davy was to be investigated.
A number of institutions then pulled out of the deal, but it was rescued by
the Bank of Ireland which stepped in to buy 9.6m of the shares at a cost of
IPounds 26m. Davy is a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: RTZ offshoot acquires Alpine Double Glazing
from the receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSIDIARY of RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, has bought Alpine
Double Glazing, the UK windows company which went into receivership last
month.
Duraflex, part of RTZ's Pillar division and one of Alpine's main creditors
with unpaid debts of Pounds 235,000, is believed to have agreed to a cash
payment of at least Pounds 500,000, plus a deferred element, for Alpine's
brand name and certain plant and machinery.
The sale of the name and assets means that none of the 200 jobs which were
lost when Alpine went under will be saved.
Duraflex refused to confirm the purchase yesterday. However, it is believed
that the company beat Alpine's main rival, Everest, as well as a second
private buyer, in a close race late on Thursday night.
Duraflex was a main supplier to Alpine, manufacturing PVC, which forms part
of the frame for double glazing windows.
The company already has a small windows manufacturing facility which sells
to the double glazing trade. Duraflex is expected to license the Alpine name
to larger manufacturers and double glazing retailers.
The deal appears to have put paid to questions over the ownership of
Alpine's assets, which were transferred to a newly formed company called
Neonbeam just days before Alpine ceased trading.
Finchfleet, a Guernsey-based but Bahamas-registered company part-owned by
family interests of Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith, is the parent of
Alpine and is believed to have agreed to the sale.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VILLIERS Group, formerly Caspen Oil, announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds
1.15m after exceptionals for the six months to January 31 against profits of
Pounds 6,000.
Mr Robert Luetchford, chairman, said that as planned, the newly-acquired
Villiers business in Wolverhampton had been reorganised. It was now a
marketing unit which offered a range of small engines.
Although increased oil production was achieved by Caspen Operating Company
the oil price had weakened, Mr Luetchford said, and the business continued
to have difficulty in providing returns on assets employed.
Accordingly, and given the opportunities available in its engineering
activities, the company had decided to divest the oil business.
An exceptional debit of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 169,000 credit) comprised a
Pounds 930,000 reduction in the value of the oil assets and Pounds 168,000
acquisition and reorganisation expenses relating to the Villiers purchase
last August.
Losses per share were 2.4p (0.05p earnings). The group trades on the USM.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: RMC in Belgian joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RMC, the world's biggest concrete producer, is to merge part of its German
operations in a joint venture with Lhoist of Belgium, one of the world's
biggest lime producers.
The UK concrete company said that the 63 per cent owned
Rheinisch-WestfalischeKalkwerke (RWK), which produces lime and limestone for
the iron, steel, chemicals and building industries, accounted for less than
10 per cent of its German operations.
The business is being merged with French and Czech operations of Lhoist in a
new Belgian-based joint venture called Chaufourneries de Hergenrath, which
will be jointly owned by RMC and Lhoist.
Mr Derek Jenkins, RMC's finance director, said that the proportion of RWK's
lime sales to iron and steel producers had fallen from about 50 per cent to
40 per cent as the industry had retrenched.
He said that 'given the decline in the steel industry it was felt this
business would do better in joint venture with Lhoist'.
RWK, which is being transferred at its book value of Pounds 90m, generated
pre-tax profits of Pounds 12m for 1992. Lhoist is transferring assets and
earnings of a similar value, said Mr Jenkins. There would be a small cash
payment to Lhoist to cover the difference between the two group's
contributions. Mr Jenkins said it was expected that the merger would have
little impact on RMC's profit this year.
The joint venture will have the capacity to produce 3.3m tonnes of lime a
year.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: London Electric static at Pounds 145m -
Charge for withdrawing from appliance retailing holds back advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHARGE of Pounds 20m for withdrawing from the electricity appliance
retailing business left London Electricity, the capital's main electricity
distributor, with only a small profit increase in the year ending March 31.
The company, however, raised its total dividend for the year by 16 per cent
to 19.5p,compared with 16.8p, putting it among the leaders in the regional
electricity companies' dividend race.
Pre-tax profits for the group were Pounds 145.5m, up Pounds 3m on the year
before and were also after lower interest payable of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds
11.2m). Earnings per share were shown up from 47.5p to 49.5p.
The Pounds 20m exceptional charge related to the decision last March to sell
or close down the group's 96 retail units because of accumulated losses.
Mr John Wilson, the chairman, said it had been a year of 'considerable
change and progress'.
He cited the sharp improvement in the contracting business, which had
transformed a Pounds 17m loss into a small profit, and the Pounds 90m
acquisition of BAA's electricity distribution networks at Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted.
He said the company 'had cleared the decks' and it was time to signal
confidence through a strong increase in the dividend.
The rise in the pay-out, the second highest in the current electricity
results season, followed a lag in dividend growth relative to earnings
growth in the two years since privatisation, and 'you can't dissociate
yourself from what's happening around you', according to Mr Wilson.
Costs had also been reduced through higher productivity, manpower
reductions, lower bad debts and a pension surplus. Real cost savings
amounted to 6.6 per cent.
London Electricity is passing some of the benefit on to customers through a
2 per cent tariff reduction in April and a Pounds 7.50 rebate next autumn.
Mr Roger Urwin, the chief executive, said that London's future strategy
would be to diversify into areas close to the core business, utilising the
company's skills and its strong financial position.
COMMENT
Clearing the decks is the word for it. London has now sorted out its
non-core business, and though the price was high, that is more than can be
said for a lot of other RECs. Meanwhile, the BAA deal shows promise, and
lies close to London's skills and operating area. Another healthy sign was
the reduction in gearing despite the acquisition. The strong dividend growth
was basically a catch-up after two years of slow growth, though it leaves
the level of cover at the low end in the sector. The shares rose 10p to 476p
in a strong market. Warburg Securities has London on a prospective yield of
5.8 per cent, which is above the sector average, and probably generous given
that the clean-out has now been accomplished.

SWINGEING provisions against a Hammersmith office development have pushed
Bredero Properties, the development company that is 49 per cent owned by
Slough Estates, into a 1992 pre-tax loss of Pounds 106.4m.
The loss, which compares with a 1991 loss of Pounds 4.5m, means that the
company now has net liabilities of Pounds 24.6m, compared with net assets of
Pounds 82m at the end of 1991. Net liabilities per share were 94p (net
assets of 196p).
The figures have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The dividend is again passed and there is no payment on the preference
shares for the last six months of 1992.
The company is still negotiating a restructuring of its Pounds 110.6m of
debt with its banks, led by Barclays. It has reached an agreement in
principle for the refinancing of its Centre West project in Hammersmith,
which is financed by a syndicate of 12 banks.
'A successful conclusion to this refinancing would significantly improve the
underlying financial position of the Group and restore shareholders' funds
to a positive position,' the company said. Slough Estates has given a
guarantee to London Transport to complete the Centre West scheme if Bredero
is unable to do so.
Centre West, a 225,000 sq ft office and retail development of which 80,000
sq ft has been sold to Coca-Cola for Pounds 30m, accounted for Pounds 77.68m
of the Pounds 105.07m of exceptional charges. Part of this relates to an
agreement to take over responsibility for a 13-year lease on Coca-Cola's
former offices.
Exceptionals also included a Pounds 21.5m provision against the carrying
value of other assets, principally development sites, a Pounds 3.88m loss on
the disposal of the Bon Accord Centre and a Pounds 2m provision for
refinancing costs.
The announcement pushed Bredero's share price down from 12p to 7 1/2 p.
The company incurred a loss before exceptional items of Pounds 1.37m,
against a profit Pounds 2.02m. Turnover was Pounds 70.8m (Pounds 53.3m) and
losses per share worked through at 292.7p (13.1p).

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Clayform seeks Pounds 27m in order to
repair the balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAYFORM Properties, which recently appointed Mr Martin Landau, a property
entrepreneur, to its board, yesterday announced a Pounds 27.1m placing and
open offer to repair its balance sheet.
The company is changing its name to Development Securities to reflect 'a new
phase in the development of the group focused on expanding its investment
and development property portfolio'.
The placing is unusual in that the new shares, which are priced at 35p per
share, will be issued at a premium to its net asset value, which stands at
30p per share.
The share price rose yesterday from 35p to 40p, reflecting investors'
willingness to back Mr Landau who until 1990 was the deputy chairman of
Imry, a property company now owned by Barclays. The shares have risen from
11p per share since June 11 when Clayform announced the appointment of Mr
Landau.
Clayform is issuing 80.3m shares on a 2-for-1 basis. The new shares have
been conditionally placed by Flemings, subject to clawback by qualifying
holders under the open offer.
In addition to taking up his entitlement of 2m shares, Mr Landau has agreed
to purchase up to 3.13m additional shares, depending on the take-up under
the open offer. He currently holds a 3 per cent stake in the company.
About Pounds 6m of the money raised will repay existing banking facilities
and Pounds 21.1m will initially be put on deposit. The injection of new
capital has allowed directors to renegotiate the group's main banking
facilities.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lazard Invest launches high income trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Lazard Investors is launching a high income investment trust, which will
invest in convertible preference shares and convertible bonds.
The Lazard High Income Trust is a revamped version of Grahams Rintoul's High
Income trust, which was scheduled to be launched in March.
The proposed gross yield on the trust has fallen from 8.5 to 8 per cent
since March, mainly because of the Budget change which reduced the tax
credit on dividends. The trust has dropped earlier plans for gearing via the
issue of zero dividend preference shares.
The trust will pay quarterly dividends and will have a six year life, with
no further share issues intended. The minimum investment will be Pounds
1,000.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold price reaches 2
1/2-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market bulls were in full cry at the end of this week as an
accumulation of constructive signals prompted a surge in the London bullion
market price to a 2 1/2 -year high.
Only ten days ago speculators had been testing the bottom end of the recent
trading range at about Dollars 366 a troy ounce. But when support at that
level held they were quick to change tack. The resulting rally was
interrupted briefly on Monday by a modest bout of technically-inspired
selling. But the price fall was made up the next day in a prelude to an
accelerating rise that culminated in yesterday's Dollars 6.50 advance to
Dollars 390 an ounce, up Dollars 13.55 on the week.
Investors seemed to be interested only in bullish developments, such as
European interest rate cuts, signs of a quickening in US inflation and an
announcement by international financier Sir James Goldsmith that he planned
to swap gold mine shares for gold bullion. Professional traders took a more
sceptical view of Sir James' announcement, however, expressing disbelief
that a professional speculator would make such a revelation before the deal
was completed. 'He has either already bought the gold,' said one trader, 'or
he doesn't intend to buy any.'
The traders suggested that the gold market had borrowed some of the renewed
strength of the silver market, which was being buoyed up on a wave of buying
from New York commodity funds. Gold was being dragged up, they said, because
computer trading programmes frequently linked the two precious metals.
Silver's upsurge continued yesterday, when it gained another 18.5 cents to
close in London at 492.5 cents an ounce, up 44 cents on the week.
The platinum market joined in the fun, the London price gaining Dollars
11.75 on the week to Dollars 395 an ounce at yesterday's afternoon fixing.
But it was again outperformed by its sister metal, palladium, which rose
Dollars 16.75 to a four-year high of Dollars 146 an ounce. Traders
attributed palladium's impressive performance of late, which seems not to
have been affected by the ups and downs of the other precious metals, to
very strong physical demand from Japan, almost certainly from the electrical
goods sector, and from US electrical goods producers.
They also noted that the price rise had not elicited the usual increased
deliveries from Russia, which accounts for about half the world's palladium
supply. Mr Nikolai Menshikov, deputy director of the Platina unit of Russian
precious metals exporter Almazyuvelirexport, denied suggestions that Russia
was holding back on contracted supplies. He told Reuter his company was
meeting all contracts to deliver the metal and would continue to act
responsibly on world markets.
At the London Metal Exchange the copper contract, which, along with lead,
was switched on Thursday from sterling to US dollar denomination, at last
managed to break through the Dollars 1,900-a-tonne barrier for three months
metal. It closed yesterday at Dollars 1,923.50 a tonne, up Dollars 46.50 on
the week.
Traders said the rise partly reflected lost production at Chile's
Chuquicamata mine but added that the market's attention was in particular
focused on the US, where labour contracts at Kennecott and Phelps Dodge
expired this week. Strike talk was in the air, they said.
Another strong LME market was aluminium, aided by the long-awaited
announcement of a substantial production cut. The mystery about where the
expected retrenchment was to happen, which was still puzzling traders on
Monday, was solved that night when Aluminum Company of America, the world's
biggest producer, said it was to cut its primary aluminium production in the
US by 268,000 tonnes a year, or nearly 25 per cent.
As often happens when expected bullish news is announced, the market's
immediate gains were quickly erased and LME aluminium prices actually ended
lower on Tuesday. But they were quickly back into the plus column as traders
looked around for other big producers to follow Alcoa's lead. So far none
has appeared, but the expectations were given a boost yesterday by a strong
rumour that the Bonneville Power Authority would shortly announce new
electricity charges that could affect production policy decisions at several
north-western US smelters. Three months delivery aluminium closed yesterday
at Dollars 1,262.50 a tonne, up Dollars 33 on the week.
Cocoa futures prices rallied at the London Commodities Exchange yesterday as
concern about a possible supply squeeze forced up nearby positions. The
September delivery position ended at Pounds 746 a tonne, up Pounds 26 on the
day and Pounds 18 on the week.
Robusta coffee prices were also stronger, the September quotation rising
Dollars 12 on the day to finish Dollars 4 up on balance at Dollars 927 a
tonne. But dealers noted that trading was very quiet.
Oil prices, already depressed by continuing overproduction by members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting countries, came under further pressure
late this week after the US said it would allow Iraq to export some oil if
Baghdad agreed on conditions with the United Nations in talks next week. On
the European physical market North Sea Brent blend prices sank to six-month
lows, and at London's International Petroleum Exchange the September futures
price fell 61 cents on the week to an 18-month low of Dollars 17.08 a barrel
in late trading yesterday.

FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: London Pride boosts Fuller Smith to Pounds
8.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS OF Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the USM-quoted Chiswick-based brewer,
improved from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 8.26m pre-tax for the 53 weeks ended
April 3.
The 6 per cent advance was scored on the back of a 7 per cent rise in sales
to Pounds 81.88m.
Earnings per share dipped to 23.33p (25.18p) because of a one-off deferred
tax credit of Pounds 977,000 last year. Without that adjustment earnings
would have shown a 10 per cent increase.
A proposed final dividend of 5p makes a 7.4p (6.71p) total.
Managed house beer volumes were up 3 per cent but profits were marginally
down partly because of start-up costs of several new pubs. The tenanted pubs
'struggled' and barrelage was down 4 per cent over the year.
The hotels side was not expected to do well and profits from the division
were down by 26 per cent. However, the hotels were still profitable although
increasing competition in the Heathrow area continued to depress room rates.
The downside in these activities was more than matched by a 33 per cent
increase in free trade beer volumes and 23 per cent in the wholesaling side.
In particular, sales of the premium brand, draught London Pride, were ahead
by 26 per cent.
Exports now total 5.5 per cent of production. A 53 per cent rise in sales
mostly came from the US but recent months have seen contracts in the Gulf,
Hong Kong and Scandinavia.
The directors said the Chancellor had failed to 'harmonise excise duty
following the advent of the single market, with the result that 10 per cent
of all beer consumed at home is coming from France.'

AUDIOLINE, the privately-owned consumer electronics group run by Mr Harry
Moss, has acquired Southwestern Bell Telecom's UK telecommunications
business for an undisclosed sum.
Southwestern, one of the Bell regional telephone companies in the US, began
marketing its products in the UK in 1987 and has built up branded equipment
sales of about Pounds 15m a year.
Under licensing agreements Audioline will continue to use the BELL symbol
and the Southwestern Bell Telecom and Southwestern Bell Freedom Phone brand
names in marketing cordless and corded telephones, answering machines and
payphones.
'The acquisition is complementary to our current business,' said Mr Moss.
'It enables us to expand product lines as well as enter new areas such as
cordless phones and payphones where SBT had a strong market presence.'
Audioline, which has annual sales approaching Pounds 40m claims to be the
second largest telephone equipment supplier in the UK.
Southwestern will focus on its growing UK cable television and
telecommunications interests. It has 55,000 cable television customers.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Monster movies: The summer of '93 is shaping up as a big hit
for Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forgive the inhabitants of Beverly Hills this weekend if they indulge in
bouts of self-admiration even greater than normal.
This week has brought evidence that the summer of 1993 could be shaping up
as a good one for the US film industry, despite early flops which had some
critics writing it off as a 'summer of stinkers'.
The biggest hit seems certain to be Jurassic Park, directed by Steven
Spielberg, of Jaws and ET fame. It has been breaking industry records since
it opened.
As every human susceptible to the Hollywood publicity machine must now know,
it is a tale of dinosaurs brought back from extinction, which proceed to run
amok in a tropical theme park. The stars of the film are the extraordinarily
life-like reptiles, created by computer graphics, which provide viewers with
an entirely new dimension in cinematic terror.
But the past 10 days have also seen the release to big audiences (but mixed
reviews) of two more movies with substantial hit potential: Sleepless in
Seattle, a romantic comedy featuring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan; and The Firm
starring Tom Cruise, a thriller about a crooked law firm based on the
best-seller by John Grisham.
The summer season is one of the two the most important times of the year for
the US movie industry, which releases its most popular films now or at
Christmas, when people tend to have more leisure. The three and a half
months of summer generate about 40 per cent of annual US box office
revenues.
So far this summer US ticket sales are up 7 per cent on 1992, according to
Mr John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations, a film industry
consultancy, who reckons that a host of films only now being released will
provide a 'second wave' of momentum.
'It's going to be a big summer,' he says, 'probably a record breaker,
passing 1989.' That summer was the industry's best, with US box office
receipts soaring well over Dollars 2bn, thanks to such movies as Batman,
Lethal Weapon 2, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, and When Harry Met Sally.
If the predictions are right, there will be a much-needed psychological
boost to an industry which has seen the volume of US ticket sales edge down
in each of the past three calendar years, and is suffering from a decline in
the numbers of 13- to 25-year-old Americans - traditionally the most avid
movie-goers.
However, the upturn will not necessarily put the industry in better
financial health. For the number of films being released this summer is
unusually large - about 60, up by a third from last year, which far
outstrips any likely improvement in revenues.
One of the biggest winners among the top Hollywood studios appears to be
Universal, part of the MCA entertainment group, which is in turn owned by
the Japanese electronics company, Matsushita. Universal is behind Jurassic
Park, which smashed through Dollars 100m in box office receipts just nine
days after its release, beating the record of 10 days set by Batman in 1989.
Industry observers reckon the film could challenge Spielberg's own record
for the best-selling movie of all-time, set by ET, which grossed Dollars
399m in the US between 1983 and 1985. However, allowing for ticket price
inflation, Jurassic Park would need to top Dollars 650m genuinely to beat
ET, and that seems unlikely.
Jurassic Park certainly needs to be a monster hit, for Universal reputedly
invested well over Dollars 100m in making and then heavily marketing the
movie, with an estimated Dollars 25m spent on creating the dinosaurs alone.
Columbia, part of Japan's Sony group, is thought to have poured about
Dollars 100m into the early summer's other hugely promoted film, Last Action
Hero, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, the lantern-jawed muscle man who
habitually terminates villains with extreme violence in blockbuster action
movies. Schwarzenegger received an up-front free of Dollars 15m.
However, the film has not been a great hit. Observers reckon it may gross
only Dollars 50m to Dollars 60m in the US and will have to rely on overseas
sales to recoup its costs.
Unlike a traditional action movie, Last Action Hero aims for a degree of
sophistication, gets confused and falls between all sorts of stools. It
contains a complex film within the film and numerous gags about classic
movies, including a walk-on role for Sir Ian McKellen, playing the figure of
Death from Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal, let loose in present-day
Manhattan.
But Sony, Matsushita's long-time rival, has other potential winners in its
hand - and it needs them badly, since its US entertainment industry profits
are now playing a big role in offsetting the poor state of the Japanese
electronics market.
Its Tri-Star studio is responsible for Sleepless in Seattle, which was
directed by Nora Ephron, author of the 1989 hit When Sally Met Harry. And
later this month Columbia will release a new Clint Eastwood film, In the
Line of Fire, which deals with an attempt to assassinate the US president.
Perhaps more than any other big studio, Paramount needs a string of hits to
bolster the lacklustre profits record of its parent, Paramount
Communications. It had a strong performer earlier this year with Indecent
Proposal, featuring Robert Redford, but then stumbled at the start of the
summer with Sliver, starring Sharon Stone, Hollywood's latest sex symbol.
Critics panned the film.
Now, however, it may have a blockbuster on its hands with The Firm, which
grossed Dollars 7.2m on its first night.
Neither Walt Disney nor Warner Brothers, part of the Time Warner media
empire, seems to have anything as strong, though Disney's What's Love Got To
Do With It - a biography of rock star Tina Turner - is playing well,
compensating for the company's flop with the comedy Super Mario Brothers.
But while the summer is young, dinosaurs seem set to rule the film world.

FT  03 JUL 93 / The Insignificant Seven: Peter Norman on what to expect from
the G7 summit in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's July and the leaders of the most powerful industrial nations are
packing their bags for one of the fixtures of the summer calendar: the Group
of Seven economic summit which starts in Tokyo on Wednesday.
With the G7 countries suffering from slow growth or recession, unemployment
heading towards 36m in the industrialised world, and protectionist pressures
growing by the day, a visitor from another planet might suppose that next
week's three-day gathering of leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada would be of considerable significance.
Sadly, the reverse is likely to be true. The G7 leaders are a sorry bunch.
The host, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, is a lame duck who lost a no confidence vote
last month and faces a general election on July 18. All his fellow
summiteers are preoccupied with problems at home, and are unpopular.
The same is broadly true of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who
joins the seven after the G7 conference ends on Friday, except that he would
no doubt happily trade his domestic problems for all those faced by his G7
colleagues. Nor are spirits high in the European Community delegation which
will participate in the summit's economic discussions.
The Japanese government will spend an estimated Dollars 8m to Dollars 10m on
the summit and is taking it very seriously, since the G7 is the only
multinational grouping in which Japan's leader can shine. Yet its
determination to make a good showing raises the following uestions:
Who attends?
The G7 leaders, their foreign and finance ministers, and the European
Community, represented this year by two Commission vice-presidents and the
prime minister of Belgium, which holds the EC's rotating presidency. Mr
Yeltsin joins on a 'G7 plus one' basis to make clear that Russia is separate
from the main group.
This year, there is one notable absentee, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French
prime minister, who has probably realised that he has nothing to lose and
perhaps much to gain by steering clear of the event. Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, will be absent because of illness.
The summiteers will be supported by small armies of officials and the talks
will attract about 4,250 reporters out of a total cast of 11,400 media folk.
Why do they bother?
Largely habit. This year's summit will be the 19th since the former French
president, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, decided to invite the leaders of the
US, West Germany, Japan and Britain for a 'fireside chat' in the chateau of
Rambouillet in 1975 to discuss economic problems following the first oil
price shock.
Since then, the summits have ballooned to include political and foreign
issues which form the subject of a political declaration, issued on the
penultimate day of the talks. The economic discussions are the basis of a
communique issued at the meeting's end. Summits are also grandiose media
events, although leaders now realise that there are not many votes in
televised conspicuous consumption during recession.
There will be a strong 'get to know you' flavour about this meeting. It is
President Bill Clinton's first G7 summit, while the Italian and Canadian
prime ministers have assumed power since his inauguration. France's veteran
Socialist president, Francois Mitterrand, will head a delegation from the
centre-right government that took office in March.
What's on the agenda?
The main economic issues are world growth (or the lack of it) and
unemployment; trade, focusing on the stalled Uruguay Round of liberalisation
talks, and help for Russia.
The political discussions will focus on regional conflicts such as Bosnia
and Cambodia, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and strengthening the
role of the United Nations. The latter two issues concern Japan, which is
fearful of North Korea developing nuclear weapons and wants a permanent seat
on the UN Security Council. What can we expect?
Few concrete decisions. In time-honoured fashion, the summit has been
preceded by a downgrading of expectations. Following a US initiative, the G7
is trying to reach agreement in Tokyo on an extensive tariff-cutting package
to give new impetus to the Uruguay Round talks. But progress on 'market
access' has been slow in preparatory 'Quad' talks (involving the US, EC,
Japan and Canada) and hopes are dwindling of a breakthrough when Quad
negotiators meet in Tokyo on Tuesday.
The G7 leaders hope to build on the support package agreed by their foreign
and finance ministers with the Russians in April. The summit has been
preceded by some useful progress: this week the International Monetary Fund
approved a Dollars 1.5bn loan for Russia from a new 'systemic transformation
facility'. The G7 will probably back a fund to assist Russian privatisation,
which the US says could total Dollars 2bn. Mr Yeltsin can expect strong
political backing, reflecting a G7 wish to involve Russia more closely in
managing the problems of the post-cold war world.
But the US's trading partners have rejected as impractical a US plan to set
a common 3 per cent growth target for the G7 countries. Germany's interest
rate cuts this week will mitigate but not terminate criticism of the
Bundesbank's tight monetary policy. Japan will come under pressure, from the
US in particular, to expand its economy and open its markets to reduce its
huge trade surplus. But despite Mr Miyazawa's recent parliamentary defeat,
Japan's government has so far been resolute in resisting what it considers
pressure for 'managed trade' and in insisting that it can do no more to
boost its economy beyond the fiscal stimulus packages of last August and
April this year.
Have summits ever achieved anything useful?
Rarely. The law of diminishing returns has been been operating with a
vengeance as summit after summit has vainly tried to give the Uruguay Round
a 'push'. The 1988 Toronto summit agreed to ease the debt burden of the
poorest developing countries. The first and last big summit agreement was in
1978 in Bonn when a co-ordinated growth package was agreed. It failed soon
afterwards amid recriminations.
Does it matter if Tokyo fails?
It is doubtful whether the Uruguay Round could survive a total failure to
make progress in next week's talks. If the summit ends in recrimination,
some G7 leaders will call for a radical pruning or even an end to this
annual ritual.
Defenders of G7 summitry have always argued that the talks, though often
inconclusive, have kept protectionism at bay. If Tokyo lives up to the worst
expectations, they will not even be able to say that.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Letter: Contracting-out plan is asking too much
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From BARRY A REAMSBOTTOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The fact that the minister for market testing, William Waldegrave,
believes a letter from the prime minister will sort out the dire mess his
contracting-out programme is in demonstrates just how out of touch he is
with the situation in departments and agencies. ('Major intervenes over
market testing delays', June 28).
Next week, my union will be publishing a study based on the detailed
analysis of almost 200 current market tests. The report reveals that almost
half of them stand little realistic chance of being completed by Mr
Waldegrave's September 1993 completion date.
As the second round of tests is due to begin shortly afterwards, we expect
that this backlog will effectively mean departments having to undertake more
than 500 tests over the next 12 months. Since Pounds 10m has already been
spent to get less than a dozen contracts in total, the overall cost of this
exercise is likely to be immense.
Apart from not having the resources to carry out contracting out on the
scale set by Mr Waldegrave, departments are still in a state of near
paralysis over his repeated refusal to say whether the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations will apply to central
government work. This has resulted in contractors putting in two bids for
each contract on a Tupe and a non-Tupe basis. Our analysis reveals that for
every 10 contracts tendered, departments are having to evaluate an average
of 200 bids.
Instead of getting the prime minister to write him a wee note, William
Waldegrave should admit that he is asking for too much, too soon, and call
an immediate moratorium on further market tests. If he does not, the chaos
and confusion will only intensify, at great cost to the taxpayer, as well as
to the overall detriment of our public services.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Letter: Corporate mission statement is more than redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN SIMPSON

<TEXT>
Sir, The corporate world has been hoodwinked by the idea of the corporate
mission statement (Management: 'Men with a mission - more companies are
putting corporate values into words', May 10).
Everyone has one - the same one] It goes something like: 'To be the best
provider of (insert product/service) in the (insert business) industry.'
Such statements are meaningless: everybody wants to be the best.
Andrew Campbell (Letters, June 29) considers them redundant. I would go
further. At best, they are totally useless, at worst they are an insult to
everyone's intelligence.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Letter: Inquiry needed into pensions policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Second best pensions' (June 30), was accurate in
reporting that the National Association of Pension Funds is campaigning for
a fundamental national debate on meeting the income needs of the elderly,
but was completely wrong in suggesting that this association seeks simply to
protect the status quo by claiming that 'the answer lies in the current
approach to occupational pensions'. It is because the present system faces a
number of problems that the NAPF feels the need for the debate to go far
deeper.
Changing social trends, such as the increase in part-time employment and
greater job mobility, must also be reflected in the debate.
The problems with state pensions include the decline in the basic state
pension (relative to average earnings), pressure to reduce government
expenditure and the impact of demographic changes. The problems facing
occupational schemes include the growing burden of complex legislation,
particularly in such areas as tax approval and contracting-out, which
discourage employers from instituting new pension schemes and extending the
membership of existing schemes. The problems facing personal pensions
include the heavy initial charges and the all too high proportion of
contracts which are confined to the minimum needed to contract out of Serps
(state earnings-related pension scheme).
It is clear there is a need for some form of partnership between state and
private pensions and both occupational and personal pensions will have a
critical role in that partnership.
While the NAPF will itself be consulting a wide range of other interested
parties, we hope the debate will lead to an independent inquiry into
retirement income policy ultimately resulting in a political consensus. The
issues are too important to be determined by partisan interests and too long
term to be dominated by short-term political considerations.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, June 30 saw the last of the old 10p coin or florin as legal tender.
Large stocks of these now-surplus coins are to be recycled usefully at the
Royal Mint at Llantrisant.
It would greatly assist the traditional metal recycling industry,
regulators, law makers of the UK and EC and Greenpeace et al to identify the
precise point of the coins' metamorphic change.
Presumably July 1 saw an overnight transformation of one's pocket contents
to become: controlled waste under the Environmental Protection Act 1990; or
secondary raw material or product to be melted by the Royal Mint and others;
or hazardous waste whose movement is subject to trans-frontier waste
controls or total restriction recommended by Greenpeace; or heavy metal and
therefore toxic, on the basis of copper and nickel content.
Clear direction to confused industries and regulators is required to promote
investment and encouragement of basic recycling operations. The common sense
acquired to see that 'two bob' is 'two bob' must not be thrown away through
lack of knowledge of what made 'two bob' worth something to begin with.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Macho managers under fire: Lucy Kellaway examines the toll
taken by heavy workloads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Sullivan leaves his home in Dorking, Surrey, at 7am for his office in
the City of London, and returns every night just after 9pm. He is in his
early 40s and has three children aged eight, six and two. He fears that if
he does not work so hard he will lose his Pounds 75,000-a-year job. But if
he continues to put the hours in, he may lose his wife and his children.
Like other unhappy and unwilling workaholics, Sullivan is suddenly hot
political property. This week Alistair Burt, a junior minister at the
Department of Social Security, decried the 'outrageous time commitments'
that companies demand from their employees. He warned that heavy workloads
were helping to push one in two British marriages towards divorce, were
making workers unhappy and turning the offspring of wealthy parents into
deprived children.
Meanwhile, the tabloid press has taken up the cause of the neglected wives
of Britain's bosses. Lady Broackes, wife of the ex-boss of Trafalgar House,
and Lady Reid, wife of the chairman of British Rail, were among those who
recently unburdened themselves to the Daily Mail, and spoke up about the
loneliness of being a tycoon's wife.
Recent research by the Industrial Society shows that British managers work
an average of 55 hours a week, in blatant disregard of their contracts, most
of which specify between 35 and 40 hours. A Mori poll last year of 200
directors showed that nearly half started work before 8am, and a quarter
were still working after 6.30pm. About two-thirds worked at least one
weekend in four, and more than half found that they could not take their
full holidays.
These habits of macho management are becoming increasingly entrenched. One
reason is the recession: those who feel their jobs are at risk are spending
more time in the office. The second reason is the 'de-layering' of
organisations: the removal of many layers of managers has left those
remaining with more to do. A survey carried out last year for the Institute
of Management found that most middle managers had taken on new tasks, and
had little choice but to work longer and harder as a result. A manager at
IBM admitted this week that, as the company moved to rid itself of thousands
of people, remaining managers were working 12-hour days and more.
Professor Charles Handy, visiting professor at London Business School, says:
'We have half the number of managers as before, paid twice as much and
expected to be three times as productive. It leads to stress.'
According to Zelda West-Meades of Relate Marriage Guidance, overwork is a
common cause of marriage failure. 'There is a lot of arguing at the end of
the day when the man gets home. He feels very stressed and has little left
to give, and is often too tired to make love.'
The problem has been made worse by the fact that some two-thirds of British
managers now have a working wife. 'In the old model, the woman was at home
providing solace and support. Now women are telling men to share their
domestic responsibilities,' says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational
psychology at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology.
So how much work is too much? Cooper says that few people can sustain more
than a 40-something-hour week. 'It is lunacy consistently to work a 50-hour
week. These managers are just burning out.'
Some managers, rather than burn out, get out. Last month Brian McGowan
decided that he had had enough of being chief executive at Williams
Holdings, and now the 48-year-old is waiting for fish to bite on the river
Test. But not everyone is so lucky: McGowan retired, having amassed enough
money to contemplate a life of leisure; for most managers there seems little
alternative to the hard grind.
How can excessive working hours be changed? The question is seen as
increasingly important, not just in terms of saving the hearts, livers and
marriages of male managers. Long hours discriminate against women managers,
whose domestic duties may prevent them from working round the clock.
'Men tend to get promoted because they spend longer in the office,' says
Roger Young, director-general of the Institute of Management. 'What we all
want is more flexibility in terms of the working week, and when we get it we
will see more women in management.'
Prof Handy argues that one solution would be to put people in control of
their own time. 'Instead of buying people's time and ordering them how to
use it, companies should put people into groups and set goals for what they
should deliver,' he argues. Even this might not be the answer to long hours.
He admits that people may be their own worst employers, driving themselves
as hard as any corporation.
Another answer lies in better use of time. According to the Industrial
Society, British managers waste more than 20 per cent of their time in
meetings that need not be held, and shuffling paper. They also fly off on
business trips, without any clear idea about what they are trying to
achieve.
Above all, the problem of overwork will not be solved until company
attitudes change. Prof Handy maintains that corporate fashions are led by
elites, so that people at the top need to change their ways first. Until
recently most of the big corporate successes have been workaholics and proud
to admit it.
But there are glimmers of change. Sir John Collins, chief executive of Shell
UK, attacks the idea that working long hours necessarily means doing the job
well. 'The quality of the time is much more important than the quantity. I
would much rather see a manager who had visited one offshore platform and
had an impact there, than someone who had helicoptered round 10 in a day,'
he says.
Sir John ridicules the culture whereby people go home, leaving their jackets
on the chair to make it look as if they are still there. While others may
brag about how hard they work, his boast is that he never works weekends.
Government ministers such as Burt may attack the workaholic culture, yet
they themselves score higher than most as absentee parents and spouses. MPs
work long and unsociable hours with frequent midnight sittings of
parliament; ministers work harder still.
Lord Young describes his hectic day as chairman of Cable and Wireless as
leisurely compared with his time running the Department of Trade and
Industry. He, like a small number of successful, mostly male, managers,
seems to thrive on the long working days, the papers to read at night, the
business dinners and the permanent jet lag. But as Cooper points out, the
top people are self-selecting, and for each of them there are many hopefuls
who have fallen, wounded, by the wayside.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Men in the News: Bongs of Big Ben sound the alarm - The ITV
Bosses / Raymond Snoddy on Fiasco at Ten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The normally unflappable senior ITV executive, Mr Andrew Quinn, allowed
himself just one pointed comment as he walked through the central lobby at
Westminster on Thursday.
'I wonder if any of them have ever been in business?' he asked of the MPs on
the national heritage select committee who had just given him a grilling.
The session had been called to consider the ITV companies' view on the
future of the BBC. At the last moment it was transformed into a prolonged
and occasionally bad-tempered interrogation of ITV executives on how they
could dare consider moving a British institution - News at Ten - to an early
evening slot.
Emotion had already been heightened by the unprecedented intervention of
both Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr John Smith, Labour leader,
who made it clear they opposed such a move.
But the performance that unfolded in Committee Room 15 was still
extraordinary. The ITV executives wanted to talk about the business, market
and competition background to their proposal and how they were losing out to
other channels at 10 o'clock.
The MPs on the committee - a majority of them Conservative - wanted to talk
about public service broadcasting obligations. If News at Ten perished, the
public would no longer see live votes in the House of Commons, and would
have to wait until 11pm for late-breaking stories from the US or the evening
football results.
'Margaret Thatcher told us not to talk to her about public service
broadcasting. We were all told to become market people,' said Mr Greg Dyke,
chairman of the ITV Association, the umbrella organisation of the ITV
network. On Thursday he was still rubbing his eyes in disbelief at what he
saw as the lack of knowledge of some of the MPs, who seemed unaware that the
1990 Broadcasting Act reduced the public service commitments of ITV.
If parliament wanted News at Ten to stay put, why did it not say so, Mr Dyke
asked. The act simply stated that ITV should run high-quality news 'in prime
time', defined as between 6.30pm and 10.30pm. The ITV executives were
repeatedly questioned by the committee about why they should be trying to
make such an apparently radical change just six months into their new
10-year franchises.
'When you start losing market share, you do something about it. You don't
wait for five years,' said Mr Quinn.
ITV makes 70 per cent of its annual Pounds 1.6bn revenues in prime time, so
there was a commercial imperative to win every time slot in the ratings to
maximise revenues, he argued.
The ferocity of the debate over News at Ten has meant a busy and
uncomfortable week for some of the movers and shakers of ITV. Mr Michael
Green, chairman of Carlton Television, the London weekday company, and also
chairman of ITN, was giving private assurances that moving News at Ten had
not been his idea, although Carlton Television executives had clearly
supported the concept.
As ITN chairman, he issued a statesmanlike comment on Wednesday, saying: 'It
is clearly right for the television companies to take time to allow for a
measured consideration of the issues.'
Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Television, the second-largest ITV
company, said of the News at Ten debacle: 'We have handled the whole thing
very badly. This has obviously hurt ITV.' Mr Hill has consistently argued
that there should be fewer, larger ITV companies, and that the rules
preventing the nine largest taking each other over should be relaxed.
The fear is that, as Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary,
pointed out, hostility in parliament to the notion of moving News at Ten
could easily spill over into opposition to relaxing the takeover rules.
Another leading ITV boss, Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of London Weekend
Television, wrote rather plaintively to the Daily Telegraph, pointing out
that the British attachment to ancient regiments, schools clubs and
hospitals was legendary. 'But to a time?' he inquired. By the middle of the
week, Sir Christopher was giving up any hope that changing the time of the
evening news could be considered rationally - at least until the dust had
settled.
To Mr Gerry Robinson, the softly spoken chief executive of the Granada
Group, the episode shows just how difficult it is to reach sensible
commercial policy decisions when you are dealing with 15 companies. 'It was
much more muddle than conspiracy,' said Mr Robinson, who believes that a
rationalisation of the number of ITV companies is now needed.
The immediate row over News at Ten is likely to fade as ITV chiefs try to
distance themselves from the embarrassment. At Monday's meeting of the ITV
Council, which brings together the chief executives of the companies, there
will be calls for further research and a prolonged period of consideration.
What has been highlighted is the unresolved contradictions and conflicts in
the 1990 Broadcasting Act between commercialism and public service
broadcasting obligations. This is just the first skirmish. The issue is
unlikely to go away as the speed of technical change accelerates and
competition increases.
Although ITV is still riding high in the ratings, with an 8 to 10 per cent
lead over the BBC, the 15 regional companies face a series of potent threats
and uncertainties.
Channel 4, which since the beginning of this year has been selling its
airtime competitively against ITV, is estimated to have taken as much as
18.5 per cent of television advertising in some months. Mr Stuart
Butterfield, Channel 4 director of marketing and sales, says that some
advertisers are now buying national channels such as Channel 4, GMTV, the
breakfast station and satellite television first, before going on to
negotiate with the ITV companies.
Back in 1989 Mr Dick Emery, now marketing strategy director at ITV, forecast
in a speech that, if Channel 4 was allowed to sell its advertising
nationally, the impact 'would be dramatic'.
As a result of growing competition, ITV could lose 4 per cent of its
revenues this year, a serious matter in a largely fixed-cost business. Its
costs include: a Pounds 540m network programme budget for 1993; an annual
Pounds 53.6m inflation-linked news supply contract over five years with
Independent Television News. In addition, the companies will pay the
government Pounds 367m this year - the proceeds of competitive tenders for
new licences and a slice of advertising revenue. Under the old system, it
would have been about Pounds 150m.
The Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body, suggested this
week that many channels could be created by moving to digital rather than
the existing analogue broadcasts. Unless ITV gets its hands on some of those
channels, according to Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst at James Capel, the
stockbroker, 'it will be terminally bad news'.
In September, British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite venture, plans to
launch a subscription package of 14 channels for Pounds 5.99 a month - free
to existing subscribers. The consortium, in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, has a significant stake, hopes to increase the package to
as many as 20 channels. Mr Dyke concedes that by 2000 - certainly by 2005 -
cable and satellite could be in most UK homes.
Further uncertainty for ITV appeared this week when Granada paid Pounds 67m
for a 15 per cent stake in London Weekend Television. This helped to push up
the share price of other ITV companies which might be prime takeover targets
 -Central, Scottish and Anglia. Such companies are now valued on the
expectation that the law will be changed to allow takeovers. If it does not,
as James Capel says, 'their share price could come whizzing down'.
The ownership dilemma is compounded by the fact that, from January 1,
European Community companies will find it easier to take over an ITV company
whether or not the rules are relaxed for the ITV companies. Mr Robinson of
Granada believes it inevitable that someone will come into the UK market
from the continent.
If the barriers to ITV companies taking each other over come down, then Mr
Green of Carlton and Mr Robinson of Granada are well placed to become the
dominant players in the industry because they have the weight of large
corporations behind them.
Meanwhile, as the companies press ahead with cost-cutting and streamlining
to meet competition, they will do so with the bongs of Big Ben still
introducing News at Ten - whatever comedy Channel 4 chooses to schedule

FT  03 JUL 93 / Getting to know all about you: President Clinton outlines
his views on trade, world growth, unemployment and the US budget deficit to
Jurek Martin

<TEXT>
All the usual cliches could apply to Bill Clinton's raid on Tokyo next week
with the intent of breathing a little life into the 19th summit of the Group
of Seven industrialised nations.
But this president of the US is not world weary. Uncrossing his long legs
and leaning forward in his arm chair in the Oval Office yesterday morning,
he makes, as a less fortunate previous president used to, some things
perfectly clear.
'The tone, the atmosphere, the ideas that are discussed may be far more
important than what comes out of the communique,' he says. There can and
will be no question of a lack of US leadership. 'Our job is to lead,' he
announced with perfect conviction. 'I think it is difficult to do this when
you've got problems of your own, but there's a tidal wave of global change
going on.
'Look at the resources we have. We have innovative workforces; we have great
bases of technology; we have an understanding of how the world works
economically. I think we have within our power the means to move forward and
break out of this problem we're in. But only if you have the courage to keep
changing it.
'If nothing else, if we can agree to take an expansive view of our future
and to take account of our strengths', then the G7 process will continue to
serve a purpose.
He was responding to a series of questions from journalists from each of the
other G7 nations, of which the FT was the UK newspaper representative. Most
of them reflected the general prognostications that the auguries for Tokyo
and the US role are, at best, mixed.
It will be his first summit 'test of leadership', only his second foreign
foray, after the Vancouver session with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
early in April.
Cuts in German interest rates, a Japanese stimulus package and progress in
reducing the US budget deficit may be beneficial to world growth, but the
overall economic prospect, especially for unemployment, remains gloomy.
For the fourth consecutive annual conclave, political agreement on the
Uruguay Round of trade negotiations seems yet again elusive, with this
week's French steel-targeted Exocet making Balladur the new seriously dirty
word in the upper echelons of the US administration.
Grand American plans for Russian privatisation have been scaled back by
other G7 reservations before being presented to Mr Yeltsin on Friday. Bosnia
remains a source of deep division and heartache, while Japan, in effect
without a government pending elections, is currently less amenable to a new
approach to bilateral frictions. Another debacle like last year's summit in
Munich could, perhaps even should, mean the end of the G7 process as
currently practised.
Still, as the corny joke doing the rounds in Washington goes, 'at least Bill
Clinton is going to be the only head of government in Tokyo with a
popularity rating higher than the prime rate.' This may be unfair to Kim
Campbell, the new Canadian prime minister, and it disguises the fact that Mr
Clinton himself still has, last weekend's raid on Baghdad notwithstanding,
the lowest popular approval of any president at this stage of a first term.
But greater expectations still attach to him in Tokyo than to the tired or
weak veterans, Messrs Mitterrand, Kohl and Major. As Bob Hormats, the first
US 'sherpa' put it this week, summits are all about 'the US will to lead',
and never more than this one.
At 10.45 yesterday morning, in the Oval Office, Mr Clinton seemed unfazed by
all this. He was, naturally, running on Clinton Standard Time - an hour late
 -but he had warmed up earlier by giving a press conference on US military
base closures at home and overseas. Earlier in the week this notorious night
person had noted that though he rose each morning at 6.00 he could take no
responsibility for anything that came out of his mouth before 9.15. His face
was ruddy, his suit was grey, his shirt white and he was wearing a cheerful,
colourful tie from the Save the Children Fund. There were no aides around to
correct him or for reference.
This was Mr Clinton at his most eclectic and missionary, with more than a
touch of diplomacy. Yes, it was important that the G7 leaders give a
decisive push to completion of the Uruguay round of trade negotiations, but
he would not be drawn into speculation about the consequences of failure.
The G7, he said, was obviously pivotal on the trade front but there were
lots of other nations with a huge stake in the outcome. He implied that the
optimal result, from his vantage point, was that the summit should 'increase
the chances' that the Uruguay round be successfully completed by the end of
the year.
He was proud that the US was finally doing its bit to contribute to global
growth by cutting its own budget deficit, as, he noted, 'every other nation
has been demanding of us at every summit for years'. But the important
recognition was that 'we are a global economy'.
'The US deficit causes imbalance in the global economy. By bringing down the
deficit, and with interest rates coming down, I can get a little bit of
growth here by what we do. But in the end this will only work if Japan has
growth, if Europe recovers, and if what we do in the G7 is complementary.
This is why the G7 can make a difference.' The main problem, he said
dismissively, is that 'we're hung up on getting every little word right in
the communique'.
Policy 'wonk' that he is known to be, he expressed genuine enthusiasm for
getting stuck into the micro-economic and structural problems afflicting all
nations, especially over unemployment, citing both Japan's and France's
current but different difficulties in creating new jobs. He wanted all this
to be studied 'informally' in Tokyo and 'thoroughly' thereafter. 'There
should be enough time for serious discussion among the leaders without a lot
of bureaucratic rules and regulations.'
Though he was far too diplomatic to say so in the presence of a senior
Japanese journalist who had flown in from Tokyo for the occasion, other
members of his administration, remembering Munich, have said openly that
there should be a minimum of photo opportunities and a maximum of talk. Mr
Clinton did, however, express interest, his secret service permitting, in
sneaking off for a quiet meal in some modest Japanese restaurant.
That other capital of gastronomy, France, has profoundly irritated the US
this week on the trade front. Pressed on this, Mr Clinton drew some careful
and diplomatic distinctions. 'If the US was wrong in fact' on the
steel-dumping case this was a proper subject for discussion. But there was
no question that US law was 'clearly Gatt-consistent', contrary to the
allegations of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. Gatt rules, he
noted, 'say that every country - including France - can act in its own
interest if the international trading system breaks down'.
'If France wants to propose stronger multilateral (enforcement) mechanisms
than in the Gatt, I would be happy to consider them.'
Mr Clinton was also emollient towards Japan, at least in the general sense.
He viewed - and he hoped the Japanese people shared his view - that the
current turmoil in Japanese politics should be seen 'with excitement and
interest, not with tenuous concern. It is a positive thing for a great
democracy.' He ventured no speculation as to who would emerge next on top of
the Tokyo political heap, but was confident that it posed no threat to ties
with the US. 'In many, many ways, it is our most significant bilateral
relationship and the key to what happens between the US and Asia.'
Europe, equally, was to be reassured about the US commitment. Disagreements
over Bosnia, Mr Clinton said, had indeed been a headache. Germany agreed
with the US on the arming of the Bosnians, but Britain, France and Russia
did not. He remained convinced that his approach was right. But this
divergence constituted 'no reason for the US to give up on Nato or the
Atlantic alliance'.
The president even carefully avoided an opportunity to criticise the
Bundesbank for being too slow in cutting interest rates, though he did
praise the latest reduction. 'I recognise that all nations which have
independent central banks are very sensitive to internal political criticism
 -and even more so to external political criticism.' He merely said the US
needed an economically healthy Europe, not least as a market for US goods,
and that, as a result, 'the condition of the German economy is very critical
for all Americans'.
He also preferred to cast the cause of aiding Russia more as an example of
US leadership than as evidence of disagreement among the leading
industrialised powers. 'The major crisis of democracy in Russia,' he said,
'is the big issue we are facing and we have done it very well', through US
programmes and now new loans from the International Monetary Fund, approved
this week.
Similar confidence was applied to another grand project which, though not on
the G7 agenda, found itself in renewed trouble this week, the North American
Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. He described Wednesday's legal
ruling requiring the US to come up with an environmental impact statement
before presenting the agreement for congressional ratification as 'narrow'.
He believed 'we can win the appeal within the time limit' (mid-December) and
might even be able to address specific environmental concerns within the
next few months.
Without Nafta, 'it is not easy to articulate the jobs argument', making
attacks on it by the likes of Ross Perot 'superficially' appealing. But he
had no doubt that the economic benefits to both the US and Mexico would soon
become apparent and it would pass Congress, even though he conceded that in
the House, but not the Senate, 'the voters are not there today'. He added,
'we must tell Congress the consequences of not passing Nafta - it means more
illegal immigration, fewer jobs here, and a much poorer Mexican economy'.
As he warmed to his task throughout the interview, you could see why Mr
Clinton often runs late. Each question received careful attention and a
lengthy considered reply, a harbinger for what is going to take place in
Tokyo next week. Only once did he even half-acknowledge that the G7 might be
experiencing a leadership crisis and for that, too, he had an answer.
'I've only been president five months and there are new governments in
France, Canada and Italy. A lot of us folks, we don't all know each other.'

FT  03 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Still waiting at the G7 table
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BEING A WORLD leader may, at times, be a hazardous and taxing business but
it also has its compensations. One such perk, available only to the top
seven developed country premiers, is the right to attend the annual meeting
of leaders of the group of seven industrialised countries. For G7 summits,
while often un-productive in terms of tangible decisions reached, are never
short on pomp and circumstance. Next week's gathering in Tokyo is unlikely
to be an exception - on either score.
Yet G7 summits cannot be ignored. For the richest seven countries together
account for about half the world's income and purchase nearly half of
developing country exports. The policy decisions they may or may not make,
either individually or collectively, will have a profound influence on
economic prospects of the countries beyond their shores. So the rest of
world is right to pay attention.
G7 economic growth affects most things. It determines the volume of trade
these seven countries conduct with the rest of the developed and developing
world and it influences the commodity prices at which much of this trade
occurs. It also determines the extent to which populations will tolerate
trade flows, or whether they will embrace protectionism.
On growth, the outlook remains bleak, as the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development pointed put in its latest half-yearly report.
The OECD expects G7 output to grow by a meagre 1.3 per cent this year, down
from 1.6 per cent in 1992. G7 import growth is expected to slow to 3.3 per
cent from 5.1 per cent last year.
Downside risks
Next year should be better, at least according to the OECD's statistics. G7
growth is expected to accelerate to 2.8 per cent. But the authors of the
OECD report are sceptical, not surprisingly after three years of predicting
recoveries which have failed to materialise. 'A general pick-up of activity
across the OECD area is still some way off,' they write, pointing to four
downside risks to the forecast, all of which have some bearing on the
proceedings at next week's summit.
First, those G7 countries which have been able substantially to cut interest
rates - notably the US and Japan - remain dogged by heavy debts and
depressed confidence and may not deliver growth next year of 3 per cent or
more upon which the OECD forecast depends.
The Japanese economy, despite feeling the stimulus of a substantial easing
of fiscal policy, a royal wedding and now a G7 summit, shows no sign of
taking-off. Meanwhile, yesterday's news from the US that manufacturing
employment fell by 53,000 last month, and that total employment rose by only
13,000 against expectations of a rise of 139,000, confirms recent
indications that the US recovery is faltering again.
Pressure for further Japanese interest rate cuts will certainly be part of
the American lobbying for more growth-friendly G7 policies, but for the US
the evidence does not suggest that low interest rates are enough.
Interest rates
The second, and more serious, risk is that continental Europe will not even
have the chance to discover whether low interest rates will do the trick for
them. For, as the OECD points out, European interest rates remain much
higher than warranted by domestic economic conditions.
This week's half point cut in the German interest rate floor allowed Europe
a little room for manoeuvre, which the increasingly daring Banque de France
immediately gobbled up by again pushing its intervention rate below the
Bundesbank's discount rate. Yet central bank rivalry aside, neither can
claim to be defending anything other than an increasingly vulnerable
currency given the depressed states of their respective economies.
What the G7 and the world desperately need is either a decisive German rate
cut of at least two percentage points or a political deal to release
Europe's economies from Bundesbank control. There is no sign of either.
The third OECD concern is that the beneficial effects on long-term interest
rates of fiscal consolidation in the US, Germany, UK and Italy may be offset
by the short-term effects on demand. This seems esoteric given the generally
paltry scale of these fiscal measures. The more important risk is that the
cuts in structural budget deficits will come too slowly, if at all, leaving
long-term interest rates painfully high and thus cancelling out the
beneficial effects of aid from the G7 to the developing world over the next
few years.
But the OECD's final concern is probably the most serious: that US and
European fretting about Japan's trade surplus, combined with slow or no
growth, will finally abort the Uruguay round of trade talks and usher in an
era of protectionism from which everyone, but particularly the developing
world, will lose. If they take steps to avoid this prospect, the G7 leaders
can be indulged in their sake drinking and noodle slurping. If they do not,
then it will be at Tokyo that the G7 failed the world.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Botnar accuses jailed executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR OCTAV BOTNAR, chair-man of Nissan UK, yesterday issued a writ against Mr
Frank Shannon, the company's former financial director who was sent to
prison on Wednesday, for his part in a tax swindle.
Speaking from his Swiss chalet Mr Botnar, who is wanted for questioning by
the Inland Revenue, accused Mr Shannon of concealing the fraud. He also
criticised the way the prosecution case was presented, saying: 'There is no
doubt that I have been tried in my absence - contrary to natural justice.'
Mr Shannon was imprisoned for three years after admitting one charge of
cheating the Inland Revenue. Mr Michael Hunt, managing director of Nissan
UK, was jailed for eight years for his bigger role in the fraud.
Mr Botnar criticised the prosecution in the trial of the two men. 'I deny
absolutely that Nissan UK was involved in a fraud, and in particular the
allegation that I was its 'prime-mover',' he said.

FT  03 JUL 93 / MPs condemn ITV over News At Ten proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS national heritage committee yesterday rushed out a report
condemning ITV for its proposals to move News At Ten to an early evening
slot in the schedules.
The committee said it 'deplored both the proposal to reschedule News At Ten
and the evasive and wholly unconvincing manner in which representatives of
ITV sought to justify that proposal'.
The report came a day after senior ITV executives had been questioned by the
committee chaired by Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for Manchester Garton.
MPs said the hearing had confirmed their worst fears and no justification
for the move was advanced 'beyond arguments of financial benefit and
audience retention'.
The committee urged the ITV Council, due to discuss the issue of News At Ten
on Monday, to reject unequivocally the proposal to make any change to the
time at which News At Ten is shown.
The Independent Television Commission has told the companies that News At
Ten cannot be moved without its permission. Although the ITV companies have
a legal opinion that their obligation is to run a main news bulletin during
prime time - 6.30 to 10.30pm - they are unlikely to challenge the ITC in the
courts.
At Monday's meeting the ITV companies will kick the issue into touch by
calling for much more detailed research.
The committee said yesterday it would not comment on the legal issues but
believed that ITV's moral obligation was clear. The companies had
acknowledged that if there was indeed a legal requirement to keep News At
Ten they would adhere to it.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Swans wins frigate work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, will be allowed to
complete work on three Type 23 frigates, the Ministry of Defence and
receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday
The contract, which Swans won against bids from other naval shipyards, gives
the company work until November next year and enhances its prospects of
being sold as a going concern.
Announcing the deal, Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said
it was subject to the maintenance of 'satisfactory levels of productivity'.
Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield, who finalised the deal with the MoD,
said he was hopeful Swans would be sold within weeks. 'We are in active
discussions with several interested parties,' he said.
Mr Horsfield said those who had expressed serious interest in buying Swans
were companies with international activities, intending to continue
shipbuilding on the Tyne.
He said he was 'reasonably optimistic' that shipbuilding on the river would
be retained. The agreement with the MoD 'substantially increases the
confidence level in the yard', he said.
Swans went into receivership in mid May after failing to win a helicopter
carrier order from the government. Its survival chances have hinged on
completing the outfitting of the frigates, its only substantial current
workload.
News of the agreement, which also strengthens Swans' chances of winning a
Pounds 40m Omani order for two patrol boats, was released just before Labour
leader Mr John Smith visited the yard. He said the deal was welcome but
belated. Labour suggestions that the news was timed to overshadow Mr Smith's
visit were dismissed by the MoD as 'absolute rubbish'.
Mr Smith said the government should take positive action to assure the Oman
government that there was no difficulty in providing the bonds necessary to
secure the patrol boats order. The government must also push Swans' case for
intervention funding with the European Community he said.
'It's vital we save the shipbuilding potential here, not only for industrial
reasons but for national security reasons,' he said.
'It would be a tragedy if it were to close and at some time in the future we
had to order a large naval vessel from abroad. It's unthinkable that any
government could allow that to happen.'

FT  03 JUL 93 / Greater advocacy rights rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LORD Chancellor's advisory committee yesterday rejected the Law
Society's latest application for extended advocacy rights for solicitors. It
said additional safeguards were needed before solicitors employed in
commerce and industry, government and the Crown Prosecution Service could be
allowed in the higher courts.
The committee, chaired by Lord Griffiths, a law lord, has advised Lord
Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, that there are no objections to solicitors in
private practice being allowed to appear in the higher courts. But changes
are needed to the 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act before lawyers working
for the CPS and the Government Legal Service are given wider audience
rights.
The committee said there needed to be a limit on the amount of work CPS
lawyers were allowed to do in the Crown Court. The Law Society's application
would allow the CPS and the GLS to do all their higher court advocacy
in-house. The committee said that was unacceptable.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Safeway seeks block on discount project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFEWAY, the supermarket chain, is to ask the Court of Appeal to quash
planning permission granted to US company Costco to open a warehouse club,
or US-style discount warehouse, at Thurrock in Essex.
Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway had each asked the High Court for leave to seek
judicial review of Thurrock Borough Council's decision to grant planning
permission for the warehouse, which would be one of the first examples of
the format in the UK.
The High Court last week dismissed the application, but Safeway confirmed
yesterday that it had applied for leave to the Court of Appeal.
Safeway says the council wrongly assessed Costco as a wholesale operation
instead of a retail one. Thurrock granted general, or sui generis use,
approval for Costco's scheme, rather than put it in the retail use class.
Costco has insisted that its club will be open only to trade customers or
groups such as charities.
But the supermarket chains say that while Costco warehouse clubs in the US
are technically wholesalers, many of their members are private individuals.
They say that makes the clubs retail outlets.
Safeway said: 'Based on experience in America, we consider Costco should be
regarded as a retailer and their planning application should be measured
against retail criteria. To do otherwise would be unfair to other retailers
and could drive a coach and horses through the planning system.'
Analysts have predicted that warehouse clubs, which sell a range of goods at
bargain prices from out-of-town sheds, could 'turn the retail scene upside
down' with sales of up to Pounds 2bn a year.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Lang accused of gerrymandering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, was accused yesterday of gerrymandering
in his plans for reorganising local government in Scotland.
The accusations followed publication by The Scotsman of details of
Scotland's new council structure. The newspaper said the new system
comprised only 28 single-tier authorities compared with the present two-tier
system of nine regions, three island authorities and 53 districts.
The Scottish Office refused to comment on the The Scotsman's revelations,
but the 28-council structure is believed to be either the final proposal or
a late draft and is in line with recent hints from ministers. Mr Lang is
expected to announce the new structure next week.
As expected, the new local authority plans involve the disappearance of four
of the nine regions, including Strathclyde, which contains more than two
fifths of Scotland's 5m population. The Lothian, Tayside and Central regions
 -which like Strathclyde are all Labour controlled - will also disappear.
Scotland's four cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, will each
become unitary authorities. A total of 25 unitary authorities will be
created, including a new council called East Renfrewshire around Glasgow.
The three island councils will remain unchanged.
The Scottish Office has argued that local government needs to be reorganised
to make it simpler and more economical.
Yesterday Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party
accused Mr Lang of creating some authorities with anomalously small
populations in order to try to protect existing Conservative councils or to
construct new ones.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Westland is owed Pounds 385m over failed Arab deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG LEGAL tussle between the British helicopter group Westland and three
Arab governments moved a significant step forward yesterday when a
Geneva-based arbitration tribunal put the damages owed to Westland at Pounds
385m.
The dispute, which has been continuing since 1980 under the auspices of the
International Chamber of Commerce, is about the collapse of an
Egyptian-based helicopter manufacturing project.
The award figure is equivalent to more than 10 times Westland's annual
pre-tax profits. However, the company said last night: 'We must wait and see
where we go from here.'
Westland's action was against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation,
the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and the
Arab British Helicopter company.
It appeared likely that the three Gulf states would appeal against the
damages award.
Yesterday's ruling left a question mark over Pounds 90m of the damages
figure. According to the tribunal, Westland owed the joint helicopter
venture Pounds 30m at the time of its collapse, and accumulated interest on
the debt since then is put at Pounds 60m.
The tribunal already decided in Westland's favour two years ago, holding
that the AOI and the three states were liable for damages for breach of
contract.
The project, launched in 1978, involved the setting up of manufacturing
facilities in Egypt for Westland Lynx military helicopters. That was be done
through Arab British Helicopter, a joint venture with the AOI, whose
partners were Egypt and the three Gulf states.
However, the partnership broke up in the wake of the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian
peace treaty and the subsequent ostracism of Egypt by other Arab
governments. The project fell through, leaving Westland stranded after
investing in the new facility.
Under the original contract, the four partner countries were to have bought
the first 250 helicopters produced at the plant, with further production
destined for export.
Westland indicated yesterday that proceedings could continue.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Highlands join EC's poorest: James Buxton and Ian Hamilton
Fazey report on the granting of special aid to parts of Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I SUPPOSE you could say it's a bit ironic in public relations terms,' an
official at Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development body,
confessed yesterday.
'One minute we're telling people how well our economy is doing, the next
minute we're getting special EC aid as one of the poorest areas in Europe.'
The EC council of ministers was expected last night to pave the way for the
Highlands and Islands, along with Merseyside, to be granted Objective 1
status of eligibility for EC structural funds or aid - putting these areas
in the same category as Corsica, parts of Greece, Spain, Portugal, southern
Italy and Northern Ireland.
Visitors to the Highlands who sit in traffic jams in Inverness, one of the
fastest growing towns in Scotland, or see the trim, double-glazed croft
houses along the west coast, will wonder whether the Highlands merit this
category.
The population of the Highlands, in decline for more than 150 years, is
growing again, partly because people have moved in from England and other
parts of Scotland, attracted by the quality of life and the greatly improved
roads and telecommunications. Several parts of the Highlands - the Shetland
and Orkney islands, Caithness and the Inverness area, do not qualify for UK
regional assistance.
'The figures speak for themselves,' said HIE, explaining why the area should
receive Pounds 250m a year from Brussels over the next six years compared
with the annual Pounds 73m from the European regional development fund
between 1988 and 1991.
The figures, preparation of which involved 'some clever manipulation'
according to a consultant involved in the process, show that gross domestic
product per head in the Highlands was just over 75 per cent of the EC
average, the threshold for Objective 1 status.
Away from the more prosperous areas are places such as the Western Isles,
where the population is still falling and morale is low. The Moray Firth
area is suffering because of the rundown of two big oil platform
construction yards.
In Caithness the Dounreay nuclear plant is shedding jobs as it heads towards
shutdown.
The EC cash would be spent on further upgrading single track roads, building
harbours and ferry terminals, establishing new inter-island ferry services,
building advance factories and improving training.
As for Merseyside, which could gain Pounds 1bn over six years, its GDP per
head was 79 per cent of the EC average for 1988-90, but was falling at a
rate of 2 percentage points a year, and was already at 77 per cent at the
beginning of 1991. One in four men is jobless.
Projects are expected to include an extension of Wavertree Technology Park
and a spur from the M57 and M62 motorways to Speke, near Liverpool Airport -
an area with derelict sites suitable for manufacturing industries, if it can
be serviced and developed.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Lang accused of gerrymandering

MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, was accused yesterday of gerrymandering
in his plans for reorganising local government in Scotland.
The accusations followed publication by The Scotsman of details of
Scotland's new council structure. The newspaper said the new system
comprised only 28 single-tier authorities compared with the present two-tier
system of nine regions, three island authorities and 53 districts.
The Scottish Office refused to comment on the The Scotsman's revelations,

which, like Strathclyde, are all Labour controlled, will also disappear.
Scotland's four cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, will each
become unitary authorities. A total of 25 unitary authorities will be
created, while the three island councils will be unchanged.
The Scottish Office has argued that local government needs to be reorganised
to make it simpler and more economical. Unlike in England, where a
commission is taking evidence before making proposals, the Scottish Office
has drawn up its scheme following the publication of a consultation
document.
Yesterday Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party
accused Mr Lang of creating some authorities with anomalously small
populations in order to try to protect existing Conservative councils or to
construct new ones. The Tories control only five district councils in
Scotland and hold none of the regions.
Labour called the leaked proposals an 'act of revenge by a government which
consistently puts its own interests first'. The Liberal Democrats called the
plans 'grubby electoral self-interest'. The SNP said: 'The Tories cannot win
control of Scotland at the ballot box so they are resorting instead to
redrawing the map.'
The new map shows Central region being broken in two, with
Conservative-controlled Stirling district becoming a new single-tier council
and the two Labour-controlled districts of Clackmannan and Falkirk being
linked.
A new council called East Renfrewshire would be created around Glasgow by
extending the boundaries of Tory-controlled Eastwood district to include the
Conservative-voting area of Barrhead. Mr Allan Stewart, the Scottish local
government minister, is MP for Eastwood.
The Scottish Office's proposals include replacing Lothian region with a new
authority in Edinburgh, and merging Labour-run West Lothian and Midlothian
into a single council called the Lothians.

A PRIVATE member's bill designed to facilitate prosecutions against traders
in pornographic video recordings completed its passage through the Commons
yesterday.
The video recordings bill, already approved by the Lords, provides for the
strengthening of the certification system operated by the British board of
film classification.
The freedom and responsibility of the press bill, and the right to know
bill, were among more than 50 measures which failed to reach the statute
book on the final day allocated to private members' legislation.

FT  03 JUL 93 / NHS to employ outside expertise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATE sector is to be invited to help the National Health Service
develop the role of purchasing authorities under the government's health
reforms.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said yesterday that he wanted all
health authorities to have managers with substantial purchasing experience
on their staffs within two years.
Commercial organisations will be asked to share their experience of
purchasing at health service conferences and meetings. Health authorities
will be expected to recruit purchasing staff from the private sector.
Under the purchaser-provider split of the health service reforms the
management of hospitals has been separated from the purchasing functions of
district health authorities, family health service authorities and GP
fundholders.
Until now most attention has been given to developing the provider side of
the restructured NHS - by next April 95 per cent of hospitals will be
locally-managed trusts. The government will now concentrate on the
purchasers.
Dr Mawhinney will take a personal role in the recruitment of part-time
non-executive members of health authority boards when vacancies arise, to
ensure that candidates are chosen who can contribute to strengthening
purchasing arrangements.
It is the purchasing function that will eventually determine the extent to
which the contract-based reforms change the NHS. Until now most contracts
have been based on patterns that existed before the reforms came into
effect. But purchasing authorities are being encouraged to examine how they
spend their resources. This will lead to them shifting contracts to
hospitals offering better value, and reconsidering spending priorities.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Judge raps Patten over grammar school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPROVAL FOR the creation of England's first new grammar school for more
than 20 years was granted by the High Court yesterday.
Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Penrith, Cumbria, will be allowed to
apply academic criteria when selecting pupils from September.
However, the judge, Mr Justice Tucker, reprimanded the education secretary,
Mr John Patten, for claiming in a press release that the plan had 'the clear
backing of governors and local communities', and refused to award him legal
costs.
The judge said: 'I have no doubt if this statement had been made in public
meetings in Cumbria it would have been treated as derisory.'
The plan had been strongly opposed by local councillors, the head of the
other secondary school in Penrith, and by the heads of several local primary
schools. The Department for Education admitted that it had received 70
objections to the proposal and only one letter of support. The department
said it regretted publishing the misleading press release, which the judge
described as 'a most unfortunate document'.
Cumbria county council, controlled by Labour with Liberal Democrat support,
had challenged Mr Patten's decision on the grounds that he did not take
local objections into account.
The judge, however, decided Mr Patten's decision was lawful because he had
taken local opposition into account, and so his approval was 'procedurally
flawless'.
Queen Elizabeth's opted to start using academic criteria - which will not
involve '11-plus' exams - because it is expanding to take 11-year-olds.
Previously children started at 13.
In practice very few applicants, if any, are likely to be denied admission.
The legal decision provoked condemnation from opposition politicians and
teachers' unions. Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman,
said Mr Patten had deserved his 'come-uppance'.

attention in parliament and the press. FT reporters look at the latest
twists in an increasingly bizarre saga
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MEDIA furore that has surrounded the Asil Nadir affair took another
bizarre twist yesterday when it was revealed that the forged letter which
linked the former cabinet ministers Mr David Mellor and Mr Kenneth Baker to
Mr Nadir had been written by a self-styled novelist living in Torquay.
Mr Trevor Timbs, the author of the letter, now faces questioning by the
police.
Following a call from Mr John Major for a full-scale inquiry into the 'smear
tactics' used over the Nadir affair, Mr Timbs yesterday sent an apology to
Mr Mellor in which he said he 'deeply regretted' the incident.
The letter, offered for sale last week to the Sun and Daily Mail newspapers,
purported to be from Mr Mellor to Mr Nadir, thanking Mr Nadir for donations
made to the Conservative party.
Mr Timbs yesterday said that he had produced the letter on a computer as a
joke while he was writing his novel, taking the forged letterhead from a
letter that Mr Mellor had written to Mr Timbs a year before.
According to Mr Timbs the letter had been shown to Mr Nic Szeremeta, a
former journalist friend, who had faxed it to the newspapers in London. Mr
Szeremeta yesterday said that he had believed the letter to be genuine.
Mr John Darby, the solicitor acting for Mr Timbs, confirmed that Mr Timbs
met with the Daily Mail and Sun newspapers last Monday, and had been offered
money to reveal his sources. However, he had then told the Sun on Tuesday
that the letter had been a fake.
'This letter was never intended for publication. It was faxed on without his
knowledge,' Mr Darby said.
Mr Mellor said he was glad that the matter had been cleared up. 'I hope this
puts an end to this kind of silly dirty trick of which we see too much these
days,' he said.

THE INTERCEPTION of Mr Asil Nadir's mail revealed that he illegally failed
to disclose to his trustee in bankruptcy at least one Luxembourg bank
account and a Mercedes car that he owned, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy from accountants Robson
Rhodes, said last night that the court-ratified interception of Mr Nadir's
post had allowed him to recover several thousands of pounds which had not
been declared by the fugitive businessman.
Mr Cooper said Mr Michael Mates's description of the events surrounding his
work was in parts incorrect and not the complete story.
Mr Mates had claimed that Mr Nadir had no access to documents seized by the
trustee, and that his post had been intercepted and opened.
Mr Cooper said that Mr Nadir had been allowed access to documents and assets
seized from his home and office following a court order in April this year.
He said the court granted him power to redirect Mr Nadir's post, which had
resulted in the discovery of further assets. He said redirection powers were
not unusual and had been used for more than 100 years.
The action was taken because of Mr Nadir's consistent refusal to co-operate
fully with his trustee and other investigators.
In response to questions about the concerns raised over the treatment of Mr
Nadir, he said: 'People seem to have forgotten that there are so many
millions of pounds of creditors (to Mr Nadir and Polly Peck) that are none
too happy.'

</HEADLINE>

THE SERIOUS Fraud Squad's raids on the offices of Mr Asil Nadir's companies
in September 1990 were based on information which the Stock Exchange had
gathered over several years, not exclusively from information passed to it
by the Inland Revenue.
The Stock Exchange yesterday said it was not its policy to comment on
individual cases. However, the information is believed to have related to
market manipulation involving a group of Swiss nominee companies which had
been under suspicion for several years before they were linked to Mr Nadir.
The Stock Exchange's interest in Mr Nadir's affairs surfaced publicly on
August 17 1990. This was when the exchange's quotations panel announced that
it had requested advisers to Mr Nadir's Polly Peck International to explain
the circumstances surrounding an attempted management buy-out of the
company.
It is understood that by this time the exchange's surveillance unit - then
called the insider dealing group - had received corroborative information
from the Inland Revenue, whose own investigative unit had been looking at Mr
Nadir's tax affairs. Stock Exchange officers subsequently met with the SFO
and the first of the raids on Mr Nadir's premises was authorised.
The exchange said yesterday that it was long-standing practice for it to
pass on information to other agencies such as the SFO if it believed a
criminal offence had been committed. 'It is not just practice but a
statutory duty,' the exchange said.
Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, said yesterday that it had made
an informal approach to the Revenue one month after receiving a report from
the Stock Exchange, hoping that the 'gateways' allowed for the exchange of
information between authorities might apply in the Nadir case.
The Revenue had rejected the SFO approach, however. It had explained that in
this case the passing of information would have been against the rules.
The Revenue stressed yesterday that it could disclose information gathered
during its tax investigations to third parties only under 'very, very
restrictive circumstances'.
Although investigators were permitted to provide some details of their work
to other authorities it could be only when there is a direct exchange of
information on the taxpayer they are scrutinising.
The Revenue said that it would not even permit information on one case to be
transferred to another agency in exchange for information on another case.
It said any exchanges of information were 'left to the discretion of
investigators to decide what is proper', but that these officers were always
supervised and anyone overstepping the mark would be 'in real trouble'.
The restrictions on disclosing confidential taxpayer information are
detailed in the 1989 Finance Act and a series of tax management acts.
The only statutory guidelines on exchange of information are with Customs
and Excise and the Department of Social Security.

<TEXT>
MR ANTHONY Scrivener QC, the barrister who acted for Mr Asil Nadir,
yesterday called for an independent inquiry into allegations of attempts to
bribe the trial judge. He also called for Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, to publish all correspondence from himself and Mr Michael
Mates on the subject.
In his contacts with the attorney-general Mr Scrivener raised the conduct of
the Serious Fraud Office in the handling of the allegations.
However, Mr Scrivener distanced himself from Mr Mates and rejected
suggestions that he had acted as a personal adviser to the MP in his
campaign on behalf of the fugitive businessman.
The barrister refused to go into the detail of his correspondence with Sir
Nicholas, or enlarge on his comments about the SFO, insisting that court
orders prevented this.
Yet he insisted that an inquiry had to be held into the unprecedented
allegations. He said: 'It is not every day that it is alleged your client is
conspiring with the judge. I have not known this happen in the history of
the judicial system since the time of Henry II.'
Mr Scrivener dismissed suggestions that he had acted as the driving force
behind Mr Mates's campaign, saying the MP had only checked factual details
with him and Mr Scrivener had only agreed to do that with Mr Nadir's
approval.
Mr Scrivener said: 'I am not advising Mr Mates. That is ludicrous. Mr Mates
can look after himself.' MPs often made such requests and, provided clients
agreed, their questions were answered, he said.
Mr Scrivener also denied any knowledge of the claims made by Mr Mates about
the alleged involvement of intelligence services in an attempt to undermine
Mr Nadir.
The attorney-general said yesterday no evidence implicating Mr Scrivener in
the alleged plot to pervert the course of justice was ever discovered.
Writing in a response to a letter from the barrister requesting that his
name be cleared, Sir Nicholas said no credible evidence had been produced
implicating the judge. 'I understand from the DPP's office that the same is
true of you.'
Mr Scrivener said Mr Nadir could still get a fair trial in Britain. He no
longer acted for Mr Nadir and his fees stopped after the businessman's
flight.

FT  03 JUL 93 / House prices increase again, says Nationwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES rose by 1.6 per cent in June, the largest monthly increase for
two years and the fourth consecutive monthly rise this year, Nationwide,
Britain's second-biggest building society, said yesterday.
Mr Brian Davis, the society's operations director, said, however, that the
recovery was 'still fragile, with turnover still only slightly above last
year's depressed levels'.
He said: 'The trend in house prices is clearly upwards but increases for
1993 as a whole can still, prudently, only be expected to be modest.'
Prices have risen by 3.5 per cent in the first six months of this year
according to figures compiled from Nationwide's monthly mortgage sales. The
last time the society reported a monthly increase of more than 1.6 per cent
was in May 1991, when prices rose by 2 per cent.
House prices also rallied in the first half 1991 - rises were recorded by
Nationwide in January, March, May and June of that year - only to fall
sharply in the second half of the year as the recession deepened.
According to Nationwide the average price of a house in May 1991 was Pounds
58,908. That compares with an average price of Pounds 53,710 at the end of
last month - a fall of almost 10 per cent over two years.
The market is not expecting a 1991-style collapse in prices this year.
Nonetheless, there have been signs that some of the steam may have gone out
of the housing recovery since Easter. Nationwide estimated that UK house
sales had risen by about 5 per cent during the first five months of this
year but said that was against very depressed levels last year.
Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, reported that prices in May
fell by 1.2 per cent after allowing for seasonal variations. Nationwide,
which does not make seasonal adjustments to its figures, reported a 1 per
cent rise for that month.
Halifax is due to publish its June price index on Wednesday. It said that
figures from both societies, 'averaged out' over the previous eight months,
would indicate a very similar picture of flat house prices. In the second
half of this year prices will show a 'more consistent pattern of small
rather than large price rises as demand for homes increases', Halifax said.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Level of student debt rises rapidly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEVEL of student debt is rising rapidly, with four out of five students
ending this academic year in the red, says a survey by Barclays Bank.
The average undergraduate owes Pounds 1,672, up almost 22 per cent from the
equivalent figure in last year's survey. This year's new graduates expect to
owe Pounds 1,900, compared with Pounds 1,765 for last year's graduates.
Students appear to be over-optimistic about how quickly they will be able to
pay back their borrowings. In spite of the poor employment climate, more
than a third hope to pay off their debts by the next academic year by
finding a summer job.
Many students also under-estimate how deeply they are likely to be in debt
by the end of their courses, and 45 per cent believe they can discharge the
debt within two years of graduating.
Government student loans appear to be gaining acceptance, with 46 per cent
of students in the survey having taken out a government loan, up from 31 per
cent last year.

FT  03 JUL 93 / New curriculum is postponed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of a new national curriculum for technology in England and
Wales has been postponed for a year, after a report by the National
Curriculum Council said it needed more time to reduce the overload on pupils
and teachers.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, announced that the curriculum would
not be introduced until September 1995, for children up to the age of 14,
and September 1996 for 15 and 16-year-olds.
He also confirmed that there would be no statutory testing of technology for
14-year-olds next summer. The tests held this year were widely boycotted by
teachers' unions.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the NCC, said the changes would aim to 'reduce
overload, enhance clarity, make the subject even more manageable, and
re-examine the place of information technology'.
The NCC received nearly 3,000 responses to the consultation document. Four
out of five respondents said the proposals did not reduce the demands on
pupils.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Minister urges two pensions for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should be aiming to ensure that 'practically everyone' has a
second pension on top of the basic state retirement pension scheme, a
cabinet minister urged yesterday, David Owen writes.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said he expected most pensioners to be
enjoying good living standards in 30 to 40 years' time 'primarily because
they have saved for their retirement during their years of earning'.
By helping to bring this about, he suggested, the government would be able
to continue uprating the state pension in line with prices rather than
earnings.
The cost of financing the basic state retirement pension could be contained
further by equalising the retirement age for men and women upwards 'as
people are likely to live longer and have healthier lives'.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Probe involving Allcock continuing, says Yard: The tax
investigator - This week claim, counter-claim and hoax over the Asil Nadir
affair competed for attention in parliament and the press. FT reporters look
at the latest twists in an increasingly bizarre saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND YARD said yester-day that an inquiry involving Mr Michael Allcock,
the suspended Inland Revenue investigator linked to the Nadir affair, was
continuing.
Scotland Yard stressed that Mr Allcock had neither been arrested nor
charged, although it is understood that his suspension relates to
allegations that he had offered foreign subjects working in the UK non-tax
status in return for bribes.
Mr Allcock was suspended from his duties as head of the Inland Revenue's
Special Office 2 in September last year as a result of what his solicitor Mr
Michael Jones said earlier this week were allegations of bribery.
Neither Mr Allcock nor Mr Jones was available for comment yesterday. But in
an interview with the Financial Times before publication of the Michael
Mates correspondence Mr Jones referred to the 'unorthodox methods ' pursued
by Mr Allcock as part of his job.
Mr Jones explained that the sensitivity of much of the work that his client
carried out in the course of his duties meant that he would maintain
informal contacts with other agencies including the Serious Fraud Office.
According to Mr Jones the Revenue's Special Office 2 had the task of looking
into the tax affairs of 'rich and powerful people'.
It emerged yesterday that two senior fraud squad detectives in charge of Mr
Allcock's case are on annual leave. Mr Jones, however, is understood to be
preparing a statement in response to the Mates correspondence.
There is no suggestion that police inquiries into Mr Allcock's affairs are
in any way related to Mr Nadir, although Mr Allcock is named in the
correspondence exchanged between Mr Mates and Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general.
The correspondence includes an alleged minute of a meeting on September 21
1990 purportedly attended by Mr Allcock and a colleague from the Revenue in
the boardroom of Vizards, Mr Nadir's solicitors at the time. The alleged
meeting took place on the day after the SFO raid on South Audley Management.
According to the minute the two officers had described the SFO raid as a
'monumental disaster.'
Yesterday Mr Peter Knight, a solicitor with Vizards who was also alleged to
have been present at the meeting, was not available for comment.
The alleged minute referred to one of the Revenue officers present at the
meeting as saying that he was extremely concerned about the possibility that
Mr Nadir particularly would think that leaks 'had originated from the Inland
Revenue'.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Threat of post disruption grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of London-wide disruption to the postal service drew nearer
yesterday as members of the Union of Communication Workers, the main Post
Office union, voted to go on strike.
Talks between the union and management of Royal Mail, the letters arm of the
Post Office, are due on Monday in an attempt to avert the action.
The UCW is protesting over the planned closure of five sorting offices in
the capital and the loss of 6,000 jobs over the next three years.
Mr Alan Johnson, UCW general secretary designate, said a strike 'will have a
devastating effect in London because there will be no deliveries at all in
the capital'. It could also hit deliveries elsewhere, he said.
No dates have yet been set for the industrial action, which would not
involve parcel deliveries or the Post Office Counters network.
Mr Johnson said the union was not optimistic about progress at the talks on
Monday but remained 'willing to use any opportunity to negotiate a
satisfactory settlement without recourse to industrial action'.
The UCW accepts the closure of some of the offices, but wants guarantees
that there will be no compulsory redundancies or compulsory transfers to
other sorting offices.
Mr Brian Thomson, general manager of Royal Mail's London division, yesterday
called the vote to strike 'disappointing'. He added that the UCW leadership
did not have a mandate to take action.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Kiev raises stakes in nuclear arms row: Instability grows in
former Soviet Union as Ukraine, Georgia, Estonia and the Urals clash with
Moscow

THE Ukrainian parliament yesterday took a further step along the road to
becoming a fully fledged nuclear power by declaring that Ukraine owned the
176 strategic nuclear missiles stationed on its territory.
The weapons are 130 six-warhead SS19s, 46 10-warhead SS24s together with
hundreds of nuclear-armed cruise missiles carried on bombers.
The declaration was one in a series of incidents in the former Soviet
republics yesterday which underscored the precariousness of their political,
economic and territorial existence.
The Georgian government accused Russia of sending 2,000 troops in full
combat gear to Georgia, following an earlier claim that commandos from the
forces of the breakaway region of Abkhazia had landed from the sea in the
Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi and attacked the Georgian forces which still
control the city.
Georgia's President Edouard Shevardnadze asked the UN Security Council to
intervene.
Guards on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan claim to have
repulsed a force of 150 guerrillas of the Tajik opposition attempting to
infiltrate the country from bases in Afghanistan, according to an interview
on the Interfax News Agency with Colonel Valery Kochenov, a senior Russian
staff officer. The Tajik frontier is largely guarded by Russians.
A constitutional crisis deepened in Belarus, as Mr Stanislav Shushkevich,
the chairman of parliament and head of state, refused to step down in spite
of losing overwhelmingly a vote of confidence on Thursday in the Belarus
parliament - a vote which, however, was inquorate.
Mr Shushkevich, a liberal, was accused by largely conservative deputies of
failing to move Belarussian policy closer to Russia. Mr Shushkevich has
responded by demanding a constitutional assembly to adopt a new state
constitution.
Meanwhile in Estonia, the foreign minister, Mr Trivimi Velliste, yesterday
accused Russia of fomenting a crisis over a controversial aliens law to
regain control in the Baltic region.
He said some members of the Russian government were eager to set up
'traditional spheres of influence'.
The Russian parliament has urged economic sanctions and a halt to troop
withdrawals if Estonia does not amend the law which requires the large
Russian minority to pass a language test if they want Estonian citizenship.
The Ukrainian move is the latest in a chain of decisions and declarations
which point to the loss of any political will to give up the weapons and to
ratify the Start I and II treaties which have yet to be put before
parliament.
Though the nuclear missiles are still ultimately controlled fom Moscow,
unconfirmed reports point to an attempt by Ukrainian authorities to develop
their own control system.
The decision will further sour relations between Ukraine and Russia, as
Moscow has always claimed ultimate ownership of the missiles and has
demanded their return or destruction under the terms of the Start treaties.
The Russian parliament cannot ratify Start II while Start I remains
unratified by Ukraine.
The issue of the Black Sea fleet based in ports in the Ukrainian-held but
ethnic Russian-dominated region of Crimea between the two republics has over
the past few days revived animosity between the two countries.
Though Presidents Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia
have agreed to the split and continue to support it, Russian military
officers have rejected the decision.

Somali gunmen killed three Italian soldiers and wounded 21 when they forced
800 Italian UN peacekeepers and 400 Somali police to retreat after a search
for illegal weapons in Mogadishu yesterday, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
Lieutenant Colonel Giovanni Fiantini said the gunmen pinned down a convoy of
six Italian tanks and up to 20 armoured cars for three hours. 'The general
preferred to pull back and to return in the next days,' said an Italian
military spokesman.
Meanwhile the Italian cabinet agreed to send almost 2,500 servicemen to
Somalia at the request of the United Nations and the US and a further 1,200
troops to support UN humanitarian operations in Mozambique, writes Robert
Graham in Rome.
In Bonn, Germany's parliament approved deployment of 1,700 troops to
Somalia, limited to providing logistical support for other UN peacekeepers.
The vote cleared the final hurdle for Germany's biggest deployment of ground
forces abroad since the second world war.

Mr Karel Dyba, the Czech economy minister, yesterday criticised the European
Community for showing 'absolutely the wrong approach' over its reluctance to
accept eastern and central European countries as full members, writes David
Marsh in Vienna. At a conference on European integration in Vienna, Mr Dyba
said: 'We can join (the EC) tomorrow if they like. Our economy is probably
stronger than the Greek economy.'
The EC must turn into reality its decision last week to speed up trade
liberalisation with eastern Europe, he said. Last week's Copenhagen summit
resulted in 'interesting words' on opening up the EC. But 'volatility' in
Community countries was preventing firm action. 'They (the EC members) are
not sure themselves how to move ahead.'

Haiti's military leaders yesterday accepted a UN proposal to restore ousted
president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN
Correspondent, in New York.
Father Aristide did not respond immediately but last night appeared likely
to agree. The exiled president had refused to enter direct talks with
General Raoul Cedras, the junta leader, but was being pressed to meet him
face to face to conclude the pact.
Negotiations have been going on all week at a high security US military base
on an island in New York harbour, with Mr Dante Caputo, a former Argentine
foreign minister, mediating on behalf of the UN and the Organisation of
American States.
Under his plan the UN would retrain the Haitian police who have been accused
of murder, torture and other atrocities in a long reign of repression. An
earlier idea to send 500 UN troops to the country to oversee the return of
democracy was apparently abandoned.

PAKISTAN'S army, which has ruled the country for much of its 45-year
history, has told Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resolve his deadlock with
the country's president or call fresh elections, Reuter reports from
Islamabad.
One minister said army chief Gen Abdul Waheed had given Mr Sharif two weeks
in which to end the crisis or call elections.
Diplomats and political analysts said that if Mr Sharif did not comply, Gen
Waheed could ask the president to dissolve parliament. Gen Waheed has
shuttled between Mr Sharif and President Ishaq Khan five times in a week to
try to persuade the other two members of the powerful troika that rules
Pakistan to end their confrontation, which has paralysed the administration
for months. Gen Waheed's latest meeting with the prime minister followed a
conference of corps commanders at army headquarters in Rawalpindi.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Region claims extra rights: Instability grows in former
Soviet Union as Ukraine, Georgia, Estonia and the Urals clash with Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<TEXT>
ONE of the richest and most highly industrialised regions in Russia has
declared itself a republic.
The Sverdlovsk region voted on Thursday to rename itself the 'Urals
Republic' - thus claiming the enhanced rights which a draft constitution
being thrashed out by a constitutional assembly would give to republics over
mere regions.
The move is a sharp warning to Russian President Boris Yeltsin that his
efforts to introduce a constitution and federal treaty capable of holding
together the vast and diverse Russian land mass face increasing
difficulties.
Sverdlovsk council controls a relatively rich region the size of France,
with a population of only 5m. The main city, Ekaterinburg, formerly
Sverdlovsk and the fief of Mr Yeltsin when he was a regional Communist party
secretary, is the fourth largest city in Russia and one of the most go-ahead
in embracing the market.
Mr Anatoly Grebenkin, the regional council chairman, said yesterday: 'We
hope this step will give a new impulse to the process (of developing a
constitution) and will put pressure on the assembly to finally find a
solution.'
The move, accompanied by assurances that they were not claiming the primacy
of their law over federal legislation, will upset the fragile balance
between the 20 republics and the regions. Many of the latter are larger and
richer than republics, which are often sparsely populated and dependent on
central subsidies.
Under the draft constitution, republics have larger powers in the proposed
two-chamber parliament and greater rights of self-government. Since much of
the politicking now concerns the amount of its own resources each
administrative area can keep and how little it can pass on to Moscow, the
question of status becomes an urgent one.
The next meeting of the constitutional assembly, largely made up of regional
and republican leaders, is set for July 12 and is supposed to produce the
final draft of the constitution.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Ukraine says it owns nuclear arms
</HEADLINE>

THE Ukrainian parliament yesterday took a further step along the road to
becoming a fully fledged nuclear power by declaring that Ukraine owned the
176 strategic nuclear missiles on its territory.
The parliament passed a new defence doctrine declaring that the state 'owns
the nuclear weapons on its territory'. The weapons are 130 six-warhead
SS19s, 46 10-warhead SS24s together with hundreds of nuclear-armed cruise
missiles carried on heavy bombers.
The vote was one in a series of incidents within the former Soviet Union
yesterday which underscored the precariousness of their political, economic
and even territorial existence.
The Georgian government accused Russia of sending 2,000 troops in full
combat gear to Georgia, following an earlier claim that commandos from the
forces of the breakaway region of Abkhazia landed from the sea in the
Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi and attacked the Georgian forces which still
control the city.
Guards on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan claim to have
repulsed a force of 150 guerrillas of the Tajik opposition attempting to
infiltrate the country from bases in Afghanistan, according to an interview
on the Interfax News Agency with Colonel Valery Kochenov, a senior Russian
staff officer. The Tajik frontier is largely guarded by Russians.
A constitutional crisis deepened in Belarus, as Mr Stanislav Shushkevich,
the chairman of parliament and head of state, refused to step down in spite
of an overwhelming vote of confidence against him on Thursday in the Belarus
parliament - a vote which, however, was inquorate.
Mr Shushkevich, a liberal, was accused by largely conservative deputies of
failing to move Belarussian policy closer to Russia. Mr Shushkevich has
responded by demanding a constitutional assembly to adopt a new state
constitution.
The Ukrainian move is the latest in a lengthening chain of decisions and
declarations which point to the loss of any political will to give up the
weapons and to ratify the Start I and II treaties which have yet to be put
before parliament.
Though the nuclear missiles are still ultimately controlled fom Moscow,
unconfirmed reports point to an attempt by Ukrainian authorities to develop
their own control system.
The decision will further sour relations between Ukraine and Russia, as
Moscow has always claimed ultimate ownership of the missiles and has
demanded their return or destruction under the terms of the Start treaties.
The Russian parliament cannot ratify Start II while Start I remains
unratified by Ukraine.
The issue of the Black Sea fleet based in ports in the Ukrainian-held but
ethnic Russian-dominated region of Crimea between the two republics has over
the past few days revived animosity between the two countries.
Though Presidents Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia
have agreed to the split and continue to support it, Russian military
officers have rejected the decision.
Even the Russian defence minister General Pavel Grachev yesterday said that
'the ideal would be to keep the fleet united' and called for attention to be
paid to the strong objections of the largely Russian naval officers.
However, Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign
affairs commission said after the debate: 'Ukraine will move towards arms
reduction and Start will be ratified. Only our enemies can say that Ukraine
wants to become a nuclear state.'

FT  03 JUL 93 / US job figure dents hope of fast growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration's hopes of a strong US economic recovery were
dented yesterday by far weaker than expected employment figures for June.
The Labour Department said non-farm employment rose only 13,000 last month,
about a tenth of the increase predicted by Wall Street analysts. The figures
 -the latest in a string of recent weak statistics - prompted heavy selling
of shares.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 26.57 points at 3483.97.
President Bill Clinton said the economy was moving ahead but only in 'fits
and starts'. He said shaky job creation reflected the adverse domestic
impact of military base closures as well as lack of investment spending. The
international economic slowdown was also undermining job prospects in the
US.
Manufacturing employment fell 53,000 in June, the fourth consecutive monthly
decline. The manufacturing workforce has contracted by about 1 per cent
since February and by nearly 10 per cent since the last peak reached in
January 1989.
The decline in factory jobs last month, however, was more than offset by
higher employment in retailing and other service industries.
Officials said the June employment figures might have been misleadingly weak
because the survey of the workforce was conducted earlier in the month than
usual. On several previous occasions this has led to an erratically low
employment count.
Last month's figures should also be set against substantial gains in payroll
employment of 255,000 and 215,000 in April and May respectively. Figures for
both months were revised higher in the latest report.
For the second quarter as a whole, the average monthly increase in
employment was 162,000, against 161,000 in the first quarter and an average
of about 80,000 last year.
On Wall Street, analysts differed sharply in their analysis of the figures.
Mr Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, said the
June data were 'clearly an aberration'. Following a substantial increase in
both employment and hours worked in the second quarter 'the economy was
poised for solid gains.' There was no reason to revise the bank's forecast
of growth at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the second half.
Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York, said the
employment figures fitted a recent pattern of 'gravely disappointing'
economic news. Cuts in defence spending and planned tax increases threatened
to create a vicious circle of declining confidence, weak demand and falling
incomes.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Japanese current account growth easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE growth in Japan's current account surplus, which could be the focus of
sharp criticism from both the US and the EC at next week's Tokyo summit, is
running out of steam, according to official figures published yesterday.
However Japan's current account surplus with the EC rose sharply from
Dollars 25bn in 1991 to Dollars 37bn (Pounds 24.6bn) last year, according to
Finance Ministry figures for Japanese trade in 1992 published yesterday. The
48 per cent rise in the surplus with the EC compares with an 11.25 per cent
rise in the surplus with the US. Japan's current account surplus in May was
Dollars 9.5bn, up about 0.9 per cent from the same month last year, while
the trade surplus fell 1 per cent to Dollars 9.9bn. The latter fell because
imports rose by 16 per cent to Dollars 16.2bn while exports rose only 5.6
per cent to Dollars 26.2bn.
The Japanese government is likely to point to the slower growth of the
surplus as evidence that its pump-priming measures over the past year are
beginning to revive demand for imports.
The US and the EC have both called on Japan to halve the current account
surplus, which is expected to be worth about Dollars 150bn this year, about
3.5 per cent of Japan's gross national product.
The US is expected to renew its calls for Japan to stimulate its economy and
cut the surplus during next week's Tokyo summit of heads of state from the
Group of Seven leading industrialised nations.
The Bank of Japan's regional officials will meet in Tokyo early next week to
review the state of the economy. In the past such meetings have been
followed by interest rate changes. The case for a further cut in Japanese
interest rates has been strengthened by the yen's rebound against the dollar
in the past week in the face of political turmoil.
Japan's global current account surplus in 1992 was Dollars 117.5bn, a 61.2
per cent rise from the year before, according to Finance Ministry figures
published yesterday. The merchandise trade surplus was Dollars 132.3bn, up
from Dollars 103bn the year before.
Exports rose by 7.9 per cent at Dollars 330bn, an increase the Japanese
government attributes mainly to a shift in the terms of trade which has
increased the value of Japanese exports. Imports fell from Dollars 203bn to
Dollars 198bn and there was a Dollars 7bn fall to Dollars 10bn in Japanese
consumption of foriegn services.
Japan's current account surplus with the US was Dollars 44.5bn, up from
Dollars 40bn the year before, while its surplus with south east Asia rose
from Dollars 33.8bn to Dollars 41.6bn.

FT  03 JUL 93 / 'Old friends' contributed to election fund, says Hayashi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, Japan's finance minister, yesterday explained that
his 'old friends', the country's leading banks, had generously contributed
to his election fighting fund, voters were again reminded that, morally and
financially, Japanese politics is an expensive business.
Not long after, Mr Kishiro Nakamura, the construction minister, glumly
confessed that he had requested funds from his 'friends', the construction
industry, even though he has spent much of the week chastising four
contractors for allegedly bribing a regional mayor.
A Japanese television station rolled out a representative from an 'ethical
political donations' citizens' group who thought it unseemly that ministers
took money from the ministered, but the two politicians say they did no
wrong. Mr Hayashi poetically explained that banks had given him money 'for
many winters and summers'.
'I don't think they are making donations because I am the finance minister.
They give money because I am a politician and they support my party,' he
said.
Having been forced to call a snap election for July 18, the ruling Liberal
Democratic party has scrambled to raise funds from its traditional corporate
donors, some of whom are concerned that there could be guilt by association
with the scandal-prone party.
The campaign is being fought by most parties on the issue of 'political
reform' and ending the era of 'money politics', but running a campaign
against 'money politics' is expensive, and not only the LDP has had to
answer awkward questions over funding sources.
Shinseito, the Japan Renewal party, has spent much of the week denying that
its reformist leader, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the man who led the rebellion that
brought down the government, went with collection plate in hand to meet the
head of a Buddhist movement, Soka Gakkai.
The wealthy Soka Gakkai bankrolls its own political party, Komeito,
appropriately, the Clean Government party, but is also close to Mr Hata. A
JRP official said the party's candidates are raising funds 'by putting up
their homes as collateral', and tapping small and medium-sized companies: 'I
don't know where every yen is coming from, but none of it is illegal.'
As for Mr Hayashi, his office insisted that none of his support groups had
accepted more than the Y1.5m limit, and the grand total received from banks
is less than Y100m. Politicians get around the Y1.5m limit by setting up
dozens of support groups.
Some companies reluctant to make direct donations are buying advertisements
in Liberal Democratic party journals, where the rates are calculated not by
the centimetre, but by the depth of devotion to the party.
Japan may scrap its controversial system of 'designated bidding' for public
works projects, blamed for encouraging political corruption and condemned by
the US for restricting market access.

FT  03 JUL 93 / G7 meeting's success will hinge on tariff talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS and business leaders agreed yesterday that success or failure at
next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Tokyo will hinge on the
outcome next Tuesday of negotiations on tariff cuts in manufactures and
services.
A senior EC official said yesterday 'everything hinges' on quadrilateral
talks involving the US, EC, Japan and Canada on tariff cuts. Quad officials
have been negotiating all week in Toronto, and will report to a special
ministerial meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday. This was hastily arranged last week
after talks intended to hone a deal had floundered.
Initial hopes that the Tokyo meeting might secure a substantial market
access agreement to relaunch the long-stalled Uruguay Round of talks on
global trade liberalisation have dimmed as France has hardened its
opposition. The Japanese government, which faces elections in less than
three weeks, may also be too weak to make tariff concessions, diplomats in
Brussels say.
Also in Brussels, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, told colleagues
France would insist on an end to bilateral and quadrilateral negotiations.
He said the Uruguay Round talks had to be multilateralised. EC negotiators
should operate in Geneva only with a mandate from the Council of Ministers
of the Twelve.
France won sympathy because of the hard line the US is taking over
anti-dumping and countervailing duties on EC steel products, which the EC
describes as 'wholly unjustified'.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, tried to make light of the upcoming
Quad meeting, insisting that the current market access negotiations were
simply 'useful tools or pegs along the way' to a final agreement.
In London, senior British officials said Mr John Major, the prime minister,
would press hard for progress on the Uruguay Round.
The prime minister yesterday met Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director
general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Officials said the
meeting showed the UK was pushing 'very, very hard' for trade liberalisation
even though Britain realised that there were big obstacles to progress.
Leading business groups also pointed to the critical need for a Uruguay
Round breakthrough in Tokyo. The Paris-based International Chamber of
Commerce, which groups more than 100 leading companies across the world,
said a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round was 'crucial and urgent. . .
a litmus test of the political will and leadership of the G7.'
In London, Sir David Plastow, chairman of the British-North American
Research Association, which groups business, union, and academic leaders
from both sides of the Atlantic, sent an open letter to Mr Major expressing
deep concern over the lack of progress towards a Uruguay Round settlement:
'If the current negotiations fail, a unique opportunity to reform and
modernise the world trading system will have been lost.'
Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of the Union of Industrial and
Employers' Confederations (Unice), Europe's leading grouping of
industrialists, noted in an open letter: 'Businesses are running out of
time. Without effective and enforceable rules, protectionism will endanger
global co-operation and trade.'
Meanwhile, it was announced in Brussels that the EC delegation will not be
led by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, but by Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, which has just taken over the
rotating EC presidency.
A spokesman for Mr Delors said he had been advised by doctors to avoid a
gruelling 12-hour trip to Tokyo because of recurring sciatica. But EC
officials suggested that the Commission president 'might not be too unhappy'
to miss a summit whose prospects for success have receded.
The senior EC official offered a sober assessment of the prospects for a
breakthrough, predicting however that 'everybody will turn up the pressure
on Japan' to make concessions to reduce its trade surplus. This stood at
Dollars 132bn (Pounds 88bn) last year, and is expected to rise further this
year.
Whitehall officials agree that next Tuesday's Quad talks will be crucial.
The G7 summit itself, which begins on Wednesday, will not be the forum for
negotiations, although Mr Major will want the G7 leaders to keep up the
pressure for progress on trade.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Snags for Italian poll reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAST - MINUTE changes by both Italy's senate and chamber of deputies
threaten to disrupt carefully agreed proposals for electoral reform.
Both houses have worked with unusual speed to approve new electoral reform
laws and so enable legislation to be in place before the summer
parliamentary recess at the beginning of August.
But this week, first the chamber of deputies and then the senate endorsed
unusual proposals which risk being considered unconstitutional  - or being
rejected when the laws are sent from one house to another in parliament for
endorsement.
In both cases the unexpected proposals could cause a delay, as the senate
has to approve the chamber's laws and vice versa in a parliamentary process
where both houses possess equal powers.
The unexpected proposal from the senate was for a limit of three
legislatures, or 15 years, on the time that any one person could remain
either a deputy or a senator. If passed in both houses, this would
disqualify a high proportion of the best known figures in every party and
would remove 94 Christian Democrats alone.
More polemical has been the majority decision in the chamber of deputies to
allow Italians overseas to have parliamentary representation with 25 seats
in the lower house. Some saw this as an astute attempt to sabotage the
reform law introducing a first-past-the-post-system for 75 per cent of the
lower house.
Since agreement was reached on partial introduction of an British-style
voting system, a number of deputies have had second thoughts on the wisdom
of excluding a second round of voting where no candidate has achieved an
absolute majority. Encouraging the senate to pick holes or make changes in
the chamber of deputies' proposals would allow the debate to be reopened.
As it is, a sizeable portion of parliament is happy to see the electoral
reform process slowed in order to prevent elections in the autumn.
Constitutional lawyers are arguing in any event that the introduction of the
principle of overseas members of parliament is unconstitutional. The
neo-fascist MSI, which sponsored the idea, claimed this was a genuine
attempt to give a parliamentary voice to Italians abroad. At present
2,020,551 are registered as living abroad, 1.3m of them in Europe. But the
overall figure eligible could be double this.
It is unclear whether the 25 seats would be added to the existing 630 in the
chamber or found from the 473 allocated for the new first-past-the-post
system. The remaining 157 seats will be won on the basis of the old
proportional representation system.
The reform proposals being sent to the senate envisage voters with two slips
 -one for the majority vote and the other for the 25 per cent proportional
representation.
For the latter, the electorate will be allowed to vote for a party list and
state one preference candidate.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday said it was ready to open negotiations on
a trade and co-operation pact with Vietnam, boosting the Hanoi regime's
campaign to end its commercial isolation.
The announcement followed two days of talks in Brussels between the European
Commission and a Vietnamese delegation led by Mr Vo Van Kiet, prime minister
 -the first visit to Europe by a Vietnamese premier in 25 years.
Europe's push for closer trade ties with Vietnam comes amid signs that the
US is close to lifting US opposition to Vietnam's reinstatement in the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The latest moves suggest a balancing act between the Clinton administration
and the Commission on Vietnam.
'We are moving a little faster on trade because the Americans have the
special problem with the MIAs (soldiers missing in action), but not so fast
as to cause a cleavage,' said one EC official.
Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner responsible for development policy, is
expected to win a mandate for opening negotiations with Vietnam at the next
week's regular meeting of the full Commission.
The EC has trade and co-operation pacts with dozens of countries, including
Vietnam's east Asian neighbours, which include requirements for the respect
of human rights and democracy. EC officials say Hanoi's human rights record
remains imperfect, but it has made progress in the principal test of
reintegrating the Vietnamese boat people who fled in the 1980s. Some 39,000
have so far been satisfactorily accepted back into Vietnamese society,
according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
The EC normalised its relations with Vietnam in November 1989 and relations
have improved steadily since Hanoi signed the Cambodia peace accords in
Paris almost two years later.
During this week's talks, the Vietnamese delegation - which included the
foreign, finance and development ministers - also expressed interest in
joining Gatt, according to EC officials.

INDIA'S donor countries, led by the World Bank, yesterday pledged assistance
worth Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.93bn) for 1993-94, far exceeding the
expectations of the Indian government and the World Bank.
The pledge, which came at the conclusion of the two-day Aid India
consortium, the annual meeting held in Paris between India and its
international aid donors, was Dollars 200m more than last year's figure of
Dollars 7.2bn. The pledges from multilateral sources accounted for Dollars
4.2bn, with the World Bank accounting for more than Dollars 3bn and the
Asian Development Bank, Dollars 1.2bn.
Indian officials are relieved the fast-disbursing assistance component is
Dollars 2.2bn, which will help tide India over transitional difficulties in
its third year of economic reforms. Officials said there was marked support
from the UK, Germany and the US.
While acknowledging that the Indian economy had made considerable progress
last year despite the politically turbulent times, most of the donors agreed
with the view expressed by Mr Joseph Wood, the World Bank's vice-president
for South Asia, that 'the pace of future economic reform in India will
depend also on the government's ability to establish a viable external
financing plan that covers the difficult period that lies ahead.'
In Delhi yesterday the government announced its intention to further deepen
the reform process and reduce the fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP by
1996-97 from this year's 7 per cent.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Spain and France cut intervention rates
</HEADLINE>

FRANCE and Spain yesterday moved quickly to take advantage of Thursday's
German Bundesbank rate cuts, by cutting their key intervention rates by 0.25
percentage points.
The key Bank of France rate was cut from 7 to 6.75 per cent, the same level
as its German counterpart, while the Bank of Spain rate fell from 11.25 to
11 per cent.
The Bank of France also reduced its short-term lending facility, the 5 to 10
day rate, by 0.25 percentage points, from 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent.
French official short-term rates last month fell below their German
equivalent for the first time in 26 years.
The French government is gambling that the steady reductions in interest
rates will stimulate the recession-struck economy.
The Balladur administration is also aware that lower rates could be an
important catalyst for its ambitious privatisation plans by encouraging
savers to move their cash into shares.
But the Spanish cut is unlikely to provide immediate economic relief, as
evidence mounts that the country is in the grip of possibly its worst
recession in 25 years.
Figures published by the government earlier this week suggested that gross
domestic product shrank by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of the year.
Overall, investment fell 8.9 per cent, internal demand fell 2.1 per cent and
consumption stagnated.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Moslems struggle to fend off Serb-Croat offensive

MOSLEM fighters yesterday struggled to fend off a joint Serb and Croat
offensive on key strongholds in north central Bosnia.
In another bid to block the delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged Moslem
communities, Serb fighters demanded a tanker of fuel before allowing the
passage of an emergency convoy which on Wednesday was stopped near Sarajevo.
UN relief officials said Serb commanders had given guarantees that they
would suspend a Dollars 500 (Pounds 333) toll for aid lorries imposed
earlier this week.
Croatian radio said the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) had 'destroyed' the
Moslem attempts to defend Zepce, where more than 100 people were reported to
have ben killed in the fighting.
UN officials said up to 10,000 Moslems yesterday streamed out of the region,
under constant attack by Serb forces They were reportedly heading towards
Zenica, one of six UN 'safe areas' in Bosnia.
The fall of Zepce to Croat forces was another setback for the Moslems,
pinned between their powerful foes.
Serb forces are concentrated to the north apparently intent on carving out a
second land corridor through central Bosnia, connecting Serb-held
territories.
After seizing Zepce, Serb and Croat forces tightened their stranglehold on
nearby Maglaj and Zavidovici. They are now poised to deal another blow to
the enclaves of Zenica and Tuzla, further isolated by the latest advance.
Recent fighting has made impossible the delivery of humanitarian relief to
the two Moslem strongholds, supposedly under UN protection. Relief workers
fear that hundreds of thousands of Moslems stranded in the 'safe areas' will
be cut off aid.
Mr Veso Vegar, HVO spokesman, said 150 people had been killed when HVO units
seized control of Zepce. He denied reports that Croat and Serb forces had
entered into a powerful alliance against the outgunned Moslems.
Meanwhile Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and Montenegro, yesterday said
it would not extend the mandate for the mission of the Council for Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to monitor the rights of minorities in the
unrecognised Balkan federation. The move was in apparent retaliation for
Yugoslavia's suspension from the CSCE last year for supporting the carve-up
of Bosnia.

The number of European opinion leaders who think that Japan cannot be
trusted is increasing, according to a government poll published on Friday,
Reuter reports from Tokyo. A total of 3,690 politicians, government
officials, labour union leaders, scholars and journalists in Britain,
Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain replied to the
survey, carried out by Japan's foreign ministry. In Britain and France,
about 40 per cent said they could not trust Japan or were not inclined,
almost double that in the previous poll in 1990.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Schlesinger warns on monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE president of the Bundesbank yesterday warned against too hasty a move
towards European monetary union.
Giving evidence before the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe, which
this week held two days of hearings on the ratification of the Maastricht
Treaty, Mr Helmut Schlesinger said that moves towards monetary union should
be backed up with a 'clear structure for political union'.
Mr Schlesinger also cautioned that countries should not be granted too much
freedom of manoeuvre when it came to the 'convergence criteria' which set
the standards - including those for inflation and government borrowing -
with which countries will have to comply before being allowed to join Emu.
'It is better to have a step-by-step development (towards Emu) than a
cobbling together,' Mr Schlesinger said.
Although his comments repeat the Bundesbank's orthodox position vis-a-vis
the Maastricht treaty, these sceptical remarks before the court will add
weight to outright opponents of monetary and political union in Ger- many.
The court is unlikely to make a decision on whether Maastricht complies with
the German constitution before October this year.
If it rejects the treaty it is likely to mean the end of the process towards
monetary and political union in Europe.

view
</HEADLINE>

How did Britain's public finances get out of control? What should the
government do now?  How should Kenneth Clarke shape his November budget?
Bill Robinson (left), former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies
and special adviser to chancellor Norman Lamont from February 1991 until the
cabinet reshuffle in May, will offer some answers in an FT eight-part summer
series. In his first article, on Tuesday, Robinson asks: how do current
problems compare with the crisis of 1976? There are, he concludes, alarming
similarities.

FT  03 JUL 93 / Apprentices at BAe and R-R lose jobs pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPRENTICES with British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce are for the first time
not being given jobs with the companies on completion of their training. New
apprenticeships are also unlikely to be offered this autumn.
The companies, which have already been reducing their intake of new
apprentices, insist they are not turning their back on the apprenticeship
system, saying their action is due to the heavy redundancies caused by the
contraction of the aerospace and defence industries.
BAe has told all 46 of its final-year craft apprentices in its Airbus
division at Filton, north Bristol, that it does not expect to be able to
offer them jobs. The company recently announced that it was seeking another
450 redundancies at Filton by the end of the year. It said yesterday it did
not expect to take on any new apprentices this September at its UK plants.
The Airbus division, which employs 5,300 people at Filton, is offering the
redundant apprentices advice on job seeking and training credits to the
value of Pounds 1,500. It says it will pay for a one-month trial with other
companies where there is a realistic chance of a permanent post.
Rolls-Royce said yesterday it had told 33 craft and technical apprentices at
its Patchway plant in north Bristol that there would not be jobs for them on
completion of their training - which in most cases takes three years. But it
hoped to place 38 other final-year apprentices. The employment prospects of
its apprentices at Derby are under review.
The Patchway plant had 6,800 workers at the start of this year and is now
down to 6,100 with 300 more jobs to be shed by the end of this year.
Rolls-Royce said that because some of the redundancies were now compulsory,
itcould not offer jobs to all its apprentices. Those made redundant would be
given jobs advice.
For the first time in its history, Rolls-Royce does not expect to take on
any apprentices this autumn. But it said it was 'absolutely not' turning its
back on the apprenticeship system. 'Apprentices are important to our future,
but there is in the short term a need to reduce the size of the company to
become more competitive in a reduced world market,' it said.
