FT  01 JUL 93 / Arts: The Kirov's 'Romeo and Juliet' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could this be the Kirov Ballet? Was this really Leonid Lavrovsky's Romeo and
Juliet? The opening performance of the Kirov season on Tuesday evening was
one of those occasions when doubt replaces delight, and you seek excuses for
what is on view rather than superlatives.
We have loved, honoured the Kirov since its first London visit in 1961 - and
the souvenir programme for this present appearance reproduces a 1961 poster
which bears a roster of names so illustrious that the heart lifts even now.
Looking aghast at the stage on Tuesday, at the flimsy performances and the
risible production, it is hard to accept this farrago as worthy of a theatre
and a company which has ever been a beacon of classic style and the noblest
aspirations of Russian art.
We saw Lavrovsky's Romeo on the first night of the Bolshoi Ballet's first
visit to the West, at Covent Garden in 1956. The curtains parted, and there
was a triptych with Romeo, Friar Lawrence and Juliet - our first sight of
Ulanova, who was to seem that night a genius of the dance in her purity and
expressive truth. The staging was handsome; Pyotr Williams' designs were
opulent, so veristic that 'one could almost smell the Verona drains', and
filled with bustling life, with tremendous drama, with passionate and
passionately convincing dancing. We were subjugated by the breadth and
grandeur of Lavrovsky's production - the choreography a bit predictable,
perhaps, but done with devastating power - and by the generosity of the
performances.
This Romeo had, though, been first staged for the Kirov Ballet in 1940 with
Ulanova, and it is this version which the troupe has now brought to London.
It is wholly disappointing. The scenery is credited in the sketchy
cast-sheet to 'P. Vilyamo' (who is, I suppose, Pyotr Williams). It is
predictable, functional, and looks ill-realised and somewhat ricketty. The
choreography is not credited at all - a slip, or an admission? - and is
shorn of the triptych prologue, which is included in the printed libretto.
The company performance is, frankly, miserable. There are phalanxes of
people looking shifty and wearing ineffably quaint character costumes. (Most
of the nobility and gentry seem inspired by Tommy Cooper's celebrated
impersonation of Hamlet). Montague is an embarrassed bean-pole; Tybalt has
cornered most of the brightest-coloured stuffs, well set off by a gang of
chaps pretending to be guards in tin hats and sagging black St. Trinian's
knickers. A good deal of furnishing fabric swishes about as High Renaissance
fashion. The effect, were it not so sad a travesty of a fine ballet, would
be hysterical.
These problems are compounded by characterisations no less improbable and
unworthy. Shameless mugging or disinterest mark the drama, with a lamentably
weak dance style in the few moments which demand classic exactitude. (The
unidentified male soloist in the ball-room divertissement was very
disappointing; the scenery-chewing in Juliet's bedroom by her family and the
nurse was a ripe example of the art of coarse acting. The National Theatre
of Brent could not do better).
Embedded in all this were two valuable interpretations. The curious fact is
that they were given by Moscow guests, in the leading roles: Nina
Ananiashvili and Yury Posokhov. Ananiashvili shows us Lavrovsky's Juliet, a
child suddenly grown to womanhood as she and Romeo fall in love. We see it
happen in the exquisite 'private' front-cloth scene at the ball when the
lovers are alone, and like Ulanova, Ananiashvili makes it ecstatic, fateful.
The later progress of the drama comes inevitably and touchingly from this,
and Ananiashvili charges the dance with a powerful physical image. As with
Plisetskaya in this role, she justifies the dance by the clarity and power
of her style, and beautifully so in the balcony duet.
Posokhov, now with the Royal Danish Ballet, is a superb Romeo. His natural
elegance - everything light, true, harmonious - is allied to a quiet
dramatic sincerity. He penetrates to the heart of each dance or emotional
moment, and shows us its essence. Wonderful the tight focus of his anger in
the fight with Tybalt. The ardours of the young lover, the intensity of his
feelings - even something heedless in Romeo's temperament - are beautifully
stated.
Together, these two guests reminded us that Leonid Lavrovsky was one of the
masters of Soviet ballet, a fact which the Kirov Ballet's lustreless
presentation was at pains to minimise. The presence of the Mariinsky Theatre
orchestra was the other positive factor of the evening: 'authentic'
performance, such as these fine musicians gave under Boris Grouzin, is a
joy.
The Kirov is at the Coliseum with varying programmes until July 31

Can you imagine the high horses that would be mounted, the shrill outcry,
were BBC2 to promise a programme in which three men discussed what delighted
and disgusted them about women, femininity and female hygiene? But don't
worry, today's 10 x 10 is politically correct to its enamelled fingertips:
it promises three women discussing what delights and disgusts them about
men, masculinity, and male hygiene. So that's OK (10.20). Three Indian
hucksters are the subject of Under The Sun (9.30 BBC2). Shakeel sells kohl
and sings at Muslim festivals; Ansfar peddles home-made potions, he
admitting 'My balm doesn't work on me, I use Vick'; and Hashmat sells a
magic book and is an alcoholic. The subject of Ross McElwee's documentary
for True Stories (9.35 C4) is his own life and family. He says he is 'more
comfortable filming the family than starting one', though the programme
shows him announcing his engagement. If you have managed to avoid hearing
the score in the first day of the Third Test it will take some strength of
character to switch on (11.50 BBC1) and find out.

FT  01 JUL 93 / People: Carter for CU
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Brend can take some pride in the fact that he will leave Commercial
Union, the UK's biggest insurer, in a better state than when he took over
the job of chief executive in 1986. CU had suffered consecutive years of
losses when Brend was called in from the group's US subsidiary and it was
regarded as the fallen star of the industry.
Brend retires at the end of this year - just five months before his 60th
birthday - with CU widely recognised as the most successful of the UK
insurance companies.
John Carter, 55, (right) will take over the top job. Carter, a mathematician
and actuary, has been an integral part of Brend's senior management team
since 1987, along with Tony Wyand, finance director.
'We've been very pleased we have managed to make a change,' says Brend, who
says he will leave the 'ship in good order'. No change to CU's established
strategy, which focuses heavily on increasing the size of life insurance
business, is anticipated.
Brend says he is 'not ingrained with the City and its foibles', does not
maintain any business activities and will retire to the country, pursuing
interests in military history and archaeology.
He will also travel a good deal, visiting Australia as well as the 18
countries 'where he hasn't yet slept'. With Brend planning a trip to the
Baltic states in the summer, that number should soon be reduced to 15.

FT  01 JUL 93 / People: Audit watchdog appointments anger councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest two appointments to the Audit Commission have put noses out of
joint among local authorities.
The two appointees - Sir Peter Kemp, formerly second permanent secretary at
the Cabinet Office, and Kate Jenkins, who was head of the prime minister's
efficiency unit from 1986 to 1989 - have distinguished governmental careers
behind them but neither comes from local government.
The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities argued against
the appointments when it was consulted. A spokesman said: 'We are not happy
about this. People with experience of local government are
under-represented.'
The number of commissioners on the statutory local government watchdog has
recently been enlarged to 18. However, only five have local experience,
according to the AMA - the same number as in 1991, when there were 14
commissioners.
Both appointments are effective from today for a term of three years. They
were made jointly by the environment secretary, John Gummer, the Welsh
secretary, John Redwood, and the health secretary, Virginia Bottomley.
Accountancy professions, employers' organisations and trade unions were also
consulted.

FT  01 JUL 93 / People: SIB poaches solicitor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board has appointed Guy Sears, a solicitor
with City law firm Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens, to the newly-created
position of head of enforcement litigation.
Civil litigation is a growing part of SIB's enforcement activities. There
have been 46 cases in the last five years involving injunctions, restitution
orders and compulsory liquidations under the Financial Services Act.
The growing case load prompted SIB to develop the capacity to handle the
work in-house. Until now it has relied on law firms such as Denton Hall to
do the litigation work for it.
Sears has done several cases for SIB and has considerable experience in
insolvency litigation, making him a natural choice, a former colleague at
Denton Hall said.
Sears, who will join SIB's legal division today, said that over the next two
to three years he hoped to build up SIB's capacity to handle all but the
very largest cases in-house.
By moving to SIB he has given up the chance of high future earnings as a
partner in a lucrative City law firm, but, confessing to ambitions in the
regulatory field, he said he had never viewed law firm partnership 'as the
be-all and end-all'.
Just 32, he came late to the law having read natural sciences at Jesus
College, Cambridge, qualifying as a solicitor in 1987. Law, however, runs in
the family. His father is a judge in Hong Kong.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Technology: A market that could spiral - The commercial
opportunities for gene therapy are growing by the minute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolstered by government approval for a number of clinical trials in the US,
gene therapy - the process of re-encoding the DNA in cells - is on the verge
of commercialisation.
Once confined to scientists' laboratories, gene therapy is now a defined and
growing industry. New companies in the sector are springing up all over the
US and a number have obtained approval from the federal Food and Drug
Administration to conduct clinical trials on treatments for diseases ranging
from cystic fibrosis to brain cancer.
One of the first human trials approved for gene therapy, a treatment for ADA
(or 'bubble baby' disease), which causes children to be born without an
immune system, was launched three years ago, and has shown promising
results. If clinical trials on other diseases go as well, companies in the
sector say they may be marketing products as early as 1997.
'The concept of using genes as drugs is revolutionary and will greatly
expand possibilities for treating various diseases,' says Ronald Crystal, a
professor at Cornell University medical school and an authority on gene
therapy. 'The commercial opportunities are very exciting.'
Gene therapy is a spin-off from biotechnology. But whereas biotechnology
makes use of synthetic proteins as drugs, gene therapy aims to change the
DNA structure of cells so that they will produce therapeutic proteins in the
body. Originally seen as a way of addressing congenital gene deficiencies,
such as those that lead to cystic fibrosis and haemophilia, gene therapy is
now being considered for possible use in the fight against cancer, Aids and
cardiovascular diseases.
The expanded focus not only makes the approach more promising from a medical
standpoint; it also increases the commercial potential of gene therapy
products.
'The market size for gene therapy will be defined by the disease targets,'
says Marc Schneebaum, chief financial officer of Genetic Therapy, a leading
gene therapy group. 'There are only a 100 or so patients in the US with ADA
disease. But there are 30,000 with cystic fibrosis and millions of Americans
contract cancer every year.'
As the link between specific genes and diseases becomes more evident, the
possible applications for gene therapy broaden.
'More genes are being discovered to be the cause of certain diseases, which
means that gene therapy may be used to treat a wide range of illnesses,'
explains Alain Schreiber, president of the gene therapy group Vical. For
instance, non-small-cell lung cancer - the most common form of lung cancer -
has now been associated with the inactivity of a gene that normally
suppresses tumour growth.
To get the recombinant DNA sequences into the target cells, researchers rely
on carriers such as crippled retroviruses. These inactive viruses invade the
cells and alter their DNA structure. The use of these viruses, though, has
caused some concern about possible side effects. 'Retroviruses are known to
undergo a recombination if a helper virus is around,' says Schreiber. 'They
are always risky.'
As a result, some researchers have switched to adeno viruses - the class of
viruses that causes common diseases such as colds - as a safer bet. 'The
problem with these is that they are very promiscuous,' says Schreiber. 'They
are difficult to control.'
Vical has turned to liposomes - tiny globules of fat - as an even safer,
though less effective, means of gene transfer. In the UK, too, researchers
are tending to favour liposomes rather than viruses. 'The impact may not be
as long-lasting, but that may be desirable. If a therapy is temporary, it's
much easier to control in case something goes wrong,' says Schreiber.
Despite its promise, gene therapy faces a number of hurdles on the way to
the medical marketplace. The most pressing problem is how to get the
treatment into the patient.
Because of the risks involved, most gene therapy trials continue to rely on
an ex vivo approach, by which cells are removed from the patient's body,
treated, then reintroduced after a period of monitoring.
One company - Genetic Therapy - has moved to in vivo trials for its brain
cancer treatment, treating cells in the body of the patient. The company
asserts that the process is safe, since the carrier virus attacks only
rapidly proliferating tumour cells. However, a great deal of concern lingers
over in vivo treatments.
'In vivo gene therapy is much riskier than ex vivo,' says David Carter,
president of the group Somatix Therapy. 'Outside the body, you can monitor
the effects of the treatment. Inside you can't. What if the virus invades
the wrong cells? If it does, it could cause genetic modification.'
Some observers argue that because gene therapy is being used to treat a
number of fatal diseases, the risks are relative. 'When you're talking about
a brain cancer patient who has maybe nine months to live, the risks seem
less important,' says Schneebaum.
'Radiation and chemotherapy, the methods commonly used now, are known to
have serious side-effects. Our brain cancer treatment, although it may have
risks, has not yet been shown to have any side effects at all.'
Ex vivo therapy may be safer, but because it is far more difficult to
administer, its commercial potential is limited. 'Clearly, ex vivo treatment
is pretty cumbersome for any mass drug, since it can't be bought in a drug
store, or even obtained at a doctor's office,' says Alan Smith, head of the
genetic therapy programme at the biotechnology group Genzyme. 'Eventually,
the form of treatment for gene therapy will have to change if it is going to
be widely available.'
Another problem for the sector is obtaining intellectual property rights.
The FDA has sent mixed signals on the viability of patenting gene therapy
products. Although the industry has applied for a number of patents, few
have been issued. 'There are controversies about the patenting of gene
segments, and clearly this is a major concern for the sector,' says
Schneebaum.
Financing is another hurdle. When biotechnology got under way in the 1970s
and 1980s, Wall Street and venture capital groups were only too willing to
finance start-ups. Gene therapy also appeared attractive to investors about
18 months ago. The venture capital market has now almost dried up, though,
and the uncertainty surrounding the Clinton administration's health reform
programme is making it difficult for all pharmaceutical groups to raise
capital.
Like biotechnology groups in their early years, some gene therapy groups
have turned to licensing agreements with larger pharmaceutical groups to
obtain financing for research and development. Still, licensing may not be a
solution for everyone. 'We want to obtain financing, but we don't want to
give away the store,' says Stewart Parker, president of the gene therapy
group Targeted Genetics.
Many observers see a number of parallels between the position of gene
therapy today and the position of biotechnology groups 10 years ago. 'A lot
of gene therapy groups are where the Amgens and Genetechs were in 1983,'
says Fernando Quezada, executive director of the Biotechnology Centre of
Excellence in Boston.
Despite the scientific and business similarities between the two fields,
there is strangely little cross-over. Biotechnology groups Biogen and Chiron
say they are looking into gene therapy but the only group with any actual
commitment to the new field is Genzyme.
'It may be that most biotechnology groups, which are facing a number of
risks already, see gene therapy as an added uncertainty,' says Smith. 'We
see it as an exciting opportunity.'
As in the biotechnology industry, the road to commercialisation will
probably be riddled with potholes, but as the gene therapy industry matures,
more believers are betting that the new approach will not only offer
important medical advances but generate profits as well.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Tom Cowie, one of Britain's longest serving chairmen, is to call it a
day. After 45 years as chairman of T Cowie, the Sunderland-based motor
dealer, Sir Tom has announced that he plans to step down from the board at
the end of the year and take the title of life president.
Sir Tom, who will turn 71 in September, founded his business around a motor
cycle repair shop in Sunderland and the boardroom still stands on the spot
where Sir Tom once repaired motorcycles.
He brought his company to the stock market 30 years ago and it has grown
into one of Britain's top four motor distributors, employing over 3,500
people, with a turnover in excess of Pounds 800m.
Sir Tom only split his role in 1991, appointing Gordon Hodgson, 61, as chief
executive. It is unlikely that Hodgson will move up to be chairman and the
group is looking to appoint an independent non-executive chairman designate.
Lord Elliott of Morpeth, a former Conservative MP, is the company's only
non-executive director and the intention is to recruit two more.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Technology: Telecoms gets in on high-wire act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A radio-controlled robot, looping along the power cables between electricity
pylons, is helping the UK's power distribution company, National Grid, to
build a nationwide telephone network in record time.
Energis, the telecommunications arm of the National Grid, expects to offer a
long-distance phone service to 70 per cent of the population of England and
Wales by April next year, only 11 months after being awarded a
telecommunications licence.
Energis does not have to dig up the roads to lay the cable, nor get planning
permission for telephone poles or ducts. Instead, it is exploiting its
investment in the electricity pylons - or 'towers' as they are known in the
trade - which span the country.
Fibre-optic cables, which will form the backbone of the new network, are
being wound around the earth cable - also known as the ground wire  - which
is the cable looped from the top of the pylons. Heath Robinson-like machines
which lash the fibres around the cables move at the rate of one metre per
second, providing swiftest installation.
Focas, part of the Cookson Group, which is the major supplier of the
wrap-around fibre, is supplying similar systems to electricity generating
companies as far afield as Scotland and Hong Kong, the US and Scandinavia.
They are being used by the electricity companies either to carry their own
internal communications or for services to sell on to customers.
Focas managing director Ray Grimwood believes it is the regulatory
environment and the culture, not the technology, that is preventing other
electricity suppliers from following suit. As well as providing rapid
competition to monopoly phone companies, such systems could also provide
phone services to any rural area with a power supply. Eastern European
countries and China, for example, could be big beneficiaries.
Electricity suppliers have three technical options in choosing a phone
network to link in with their electricity supply. The first is to wrap the
fibre round the earth cable, which is a swift and relatively cheap option if
the earth wire is new and will remain in place for several years.
If the earth wire is old and due to be replaced, power companies often
prefer the second option: replacing the earth cable with one which
incorporates the power wire and the phone wire in the same plastic sheath.
Such systems are also useful if the electricity company is extending its
power network or in countries which lack both electricity and phone
services.
The third option is to drape the optical fibre cables between the pylons.
The simplicity of this scheme brings its own problems, despite years of work
on the technology by optical fibre companies. Energis, for example, rejected
the self-supporting draped cable because it believed that the cable would be
physically damaged if used in close conjunction with its high-capacity
transmission lines.
Developing the wound cable was not easy either. Looped round the earth wire,
the cable has to withstand ultra-violet radiation and snow. The earth wire
is also designed to take lightning strikes, when the temperature can rise in
a flash to 200'C or 300'C. So Focas had to develop a specially cured
cross-linked polyethylene jacket to ensure that the weather does not affect
services.
Today each fibre installed by Focas can carry 565Mbit/s of information -
enough to allow, say, 8,000 simultaneous voice conversations, 8,000 pages of
text a second and 10 colour video signals to be sent on a single pair of
cables.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Liberte, fraternite
and soon, equity - The selling of the Balladur bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cue stirring music, softly focused images of muscular construction workers
and a sonorous voiceover adjuring the French to 'show confidence in our
great country' and to rise to the 'challenge of proving that France can wake
up again'.
The casual viewer could be forgiven for thinking that this was a party
political broadcast left over from this spring's parliamentary elections, an
early bid by one of the candidates for the 1995 presidential poll, or even a
Foreign Legion recruitment film.
It is a television commercial for the Balladur bond, the new French
government's special bond issue, with which Edouard Balladur, the
conservative prime minister, hopes to raise FFr40bn (Pounds 4.8bn) to fund
his economic regeneration schemes.
The main aim of the commercial, the lynchpin of a FFr25m 'Invest In Our
Future' advertising campaign, is to sell the bonds. But it also has the
objective of persuading the French to transfer some of the cash now in
savings accounts and money market funds first into bonds and then into
shares once Balladur's FFr280bn-FFr360bn privatisation programme starts in
September.
'This is pragmatic advertising,' says Nicolas Monnier, chairman of Alice,
the agency behind the campaign. 'We want as many people as possible to buy
Balladur bonds, but we also want to encourage them to start thinking about
participating in the privatisation issues.'
The unalloyed patriotism of the Balladur bond advertising contrasts with the
frivolous tone of the current UK promotion of the third round of BT's
privatisation. Featuring the comedian Mel Smith, the TV and poster campaign
is part of a long British tradition of humorous advertising.
The private investor is an important target for the BT sale, but at least
the UK government knows that the issue will interest the country's large
pension funds.
The Balladur government has no such luxury. There are no pension funds in
France because of the state's stranglehold on the pension system. There are
also fewer individual investors than in the UK. The shareholding population
doubled to more than 5.5m in the last privatisation drive from 1986 to 1987,
but has since shrunk to 4.5m, partly because of the October 1987 stock
market crash.
When he launched the issue last week, Edmond Alphandery, economy minister,
was at pains to emphasise that, as a government issue, the bonds were
'absolutely secure'. His team has also devised a string of incentives,
including tax breaks and equity plans, to persuade investors to convert
their Balladur bonds into privatisation shares.
At present the government does not plan to launch a generic campaign to
promote the privatisations. The individual share sales will be publicised by
the companies concerned, such as Rhone-Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine. This means
that the bond advertising will play a critical part in shaping public
opinion in the approach to the privatisation drive and the Balladur
government decided to spend far more heavily on promoting the issue than its
predecessors did for the Giscard bond in 1973 and the Barre bond in 1977.
The Balladur bond advertising campaign is in two parts. The television
commercial is intended to set the scene by raising public awareness of the
government's plans for the bond and for privatisation. The radio and press
advertising offer more detailed information about the financial attributes
of the bonds and how they can be converted into shares.
So far the issue seems destined to be a roaring success. Economists expect
it to beat Balladur's FFr40bn target. It remains to be seen whether
privatisation candidates will follow the government's lead by trying to
persuade people to buy shares to help the economy, rather than just to make
money.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Get 'em young / A
look at the motives of big companies which sponsor educational course
material
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marketing managers looking for a wide audience need look no further than
school classrooms. In England and Wales, around 35,000 schools teach 7m
children.
This fact has not gone unnoticed. Glossy curriculum materials sent to
schools in recent months include a history of the tea trade, produced by a
consortium of tea companies, a fact-pack on the war in the Atlantic,
produced by the Royal Navy, and 'Chance and Change', a guide to mathematics
and how it can be applied to personal finances, prepared by Pearl Assurance.
Although companies have been providing teaching aids on a limited scale for
years, schools have not traditionally been regarded as a fertile ground for
promotional activities. But the introduction of the national curriculum over
the last few years is beginning to change that.
Martin Skelton, of the Ipswich-based educational sponsorship company
Fieldwork, gives two reasons for this.
First, the curriculum has prescribed what children across the country should
study in much more detail than ever before. This makes it easier for
companies to prepare material which they can be confident will fit in with
children's scheme of work.
Second, according to Skelton, the degree of prescription has made teachers
keener to embrace anything which varies the standard educational diet.
Done well, educational sponsorship works excellently for all concerned.
Hard-pressed schools are provided with useful material which helps children,
while companies demonstrate their caring credentials.
BP Oil UK, which spends around Pounds 500,000 annually on educational
material, says: 'The reason it's done is a mixture of concern for BP's
overall reputation as a responsible corporate citizen, and a genuine concern
for relevant educational development.'
The material can also educate tomorrow's customers in ways which might help
the companies' products in future (explaining maths, for example, just might
make complicated investment products easier to sell) and establish a brand
name at the same time.
Some companies use it as an aid to recruitment. For example, J Sainsbury,
the retailer, produces a series of worksheets about the 'days in the life'
of different workers in retailing.
The company's policy is: 'We are a major employer, so it's very important
for us to have people coming out of the schools system with the sort of
skills, abilities and interest in business that we need.'
Teachers are alive to the possibilities of corporate help. The Department
for Education's figures on school-business links show that 82 per cent of
schools accept help from businesses in curriculum development.
Responses to a questionnaire sent by Pearl Assurance to all schools which
requested its mathematics package found that 77 per cent of schools had
found some material from companies very or quite useful. Most of the
respondents said that companies did have a role to play.
However, Skelton makes it clear that the work has to be done well. 'Our main
premise is that any material has to be credible with teachers. Otherwise
they will probably throw it in the bin,' he says.
This fate is likely to befall teaching aids which include a sprinkling of
corporate brand-names. Companies cannot afford to be blatant. Rather, the
aim should be simply to be seen to have sponsored the work, according to
Skelton.
Jackie Miller, deputy general secretary of the Professional Association of
Teachers, believes that companies are sailing close to the wind. 'There have
always been one or two very poor primary schools which have been terribly
grateful for anything they can get. I am not sure they have perceived until
now the extent to which it's a barbed hook. Some of the larger schools see
precisely what the companies are offering and dislike it.'
Any material which arouses that kind of emotion will be counter-productive.
The National Consumer Council's guidelines now suggest that all material
should be tested in schools before it is distributed, and this is as good an
idea for the sponsors as for the educators.
Product placement has to be handled sensitively if the material is to be
used by teachers. Andrew Miller, research and development director of the
University of Warwick's School Curriculum Industry Partnership, points to at
least one blatant example which overstepped the mark - Weetabix.
Two years ago, Weetabix developed a series of school books, including a
history book, in conjunction with the Oxford University Press.
The sponsorship was rammed home to children in the illustrations, which
depicted all the historical figures it covered as bars of Weetabix, dressed
in the appropriate costumes. According to Miller: 'When something strongly
branded like Weetabix is used in a subliminal way that's not good practice.'
A subtler example comes from Pearl's series of worksheets. They include the
question: 'Find out what companies like Pearl do with the money that people
pay in so that they can pay out so much more than was invested in the first
place?' This is scarcely harmful, but mathematics teachers might be
unimpressed.
Oil companies are prolific producers of curriculum material, with both Esso
and BP providing formidable batteries of support-aids, particularly for
science and technology.
Both, however, take the opportunity to counter bad publicity about
pollution. For example, Esso publishes a pack detailing the clean-up of
Alaska following the Exxon Valdez spillage, which some might think dwells
disproportionately on how the area has now recovered. This kind of material
is valuable, but may fall prey to teachers who disagree with it.
Marketing experts say there is little point in designing material
'in-house'. Their advice is that textbooks and worksheets are best compiled
by people with educational experience, and tested in classrooms before
distribution. Material which passes the stringent tests of both teachers and
pupils then has every chance of forming part of an effective marketing
strategy.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (8): Likely to be a
long haul / Assessing expansion prospects for eastern Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL services, from banking to insurance, are now firmly established
throughout eastern Germany. But the expansion of these services depends on
two factors: the extent to which the economy of the five new states will
start growing, and the resolution of outstanding property rights.
Western Germany's big banks, and the private banking sector, moved quickly
into eastern Germany in late 1990.
The expectations at that time were high, but they were short-lived. Eastern
Germans rushed to spend west German marks exchanged for the largely
worthless ost mark. But the consumer boom ended over a year ago. The east
Germans are now beginning to save. However, what banks want to see is the
expansion of the market - and that is not yet happening.
There are two reasons why the market is not growing as fast as it should.
First, eastern Germany's exports were dependent on the former Soviet Union
and the countries of eastern Europe. Monetary union meant that these
countries could not afford to pay hard currency prices for eastern German
products.
In turn, eastern German products could not compete on western markets. In
short, any western German or foreign investor who decides to locate in
eastern Germany now does so with the expectation of a long haul.
No banker or investor expects to make quick returns - with the exception,
perhaps, of the construction industry.
This is a common view shared by the west German-owned mittelstand: the small
and medium sized companies which are now setting up subsidiary companies in
eastern Germany, and which formed the backbone of Germany's post-war
development. Each mittelstand manager in eastern Germany has his or her own
tale to tell. But all agree that these new companies have to find new
markets - markets which are concentrated on the local region. High labour
and transport costs, as well as low productivity, means that the mittelstand
in eastern Germany cannot expect any advantages with regard to competitive
labour costs.
'These small companies cannot cluster around large industry in eastern
Germany, simply because this heavy industry and manufacturing base no longer
exists,' explains Mr Georg Krupp, a member of Deutsche Bank's board and a
specialist on the mittelstand in eastern Germany. 'These companies have to
start from scratch. The memory and spirit of the entrepreneurial culture in
eastern Germany has to be recreated,' he adds.
This means that neither the banks nor the fledgling mittelstand in eastern
Germany can expect quick returns on investments. Financial services will
therefore be oriented towards the very long term, rather than the short
term.
The growth of financial services in the region will also be dependent on the
levels of unemployment. Real unemployment - including part-time work and job
creation schemes - now accounts for between 30 and 35 per cent of the labour
force.
This figure could increase with job guarantee contracts agreed between the
Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising eastern German industry, and
those who bought firms from the agency end. The Treuhand has managed to
secure 1.4m job places. An increasing reduction in consumer spending will
have an impact on financial services.
Another problem which dogs the eastern German economy: property rights.
The unification treaty stipulates that any property seized by the Nazis
between 1935 and 1945 can be reclaimed, or its original owners can seek
compensation. The same rights apply to those whose property was seized by
the communists after 1949, until 1990. But those whose land was expropriated
by the Russians occupying eastern Germany in 1945-1949 can only seek limited
compensation.
Although the government has now made it easier for investors to purchase
property - provided they are committed to creating jobs and investment -
sorting out who owns what, and what level of compensation the original
owners should be granted, has delayed both western German and foreign
investment in eastern Germany.
In eastern Germany there are over 1m claims involving more than 2m items of
property - from houses and small shops to factories and tracts of land. In
Berlin alone there are over 114,000 outstanding claims. In Leipzig, a
thriving city in the southern eastern state of Saxony, the authorities have
yet to process over 26,000 claims.
Claims take time. In some cases the relatives or heirs cannot be contacted.
Even if they can be found, and all the relevant documents are presented to
the property rights offices in each city, constant disputes over the levels
of compensation take place. There is also the emotional problem of
reclaiming property in which some families have lived for decades. Efforts
have been made to protect the rights of the latter, particularly if they
acquired the property in good faith. But nevertheless, justice ministry
officials in the eastern German states say that the whole question of
property rights has slowed down investment.
'It is too late now. But we should have decided on one or the other -
compensation or restitution. The law has pleased no one. But when it comes
to property, I wonder whether any other decision would have pleased
everybody,' a senior justice ministry official said recently.
Outstanding property rights are expected to be resolved in about 10 years.
But western German investors, bankers, and the business community agree that
it will take at least 10 years for eastern Germany to create an
infrastructure and an environment which will allow it to compete within the
whole of Germany and the European Community.
'No matter what sector of the economy you talk about, we have to look to the
long term. There is no such thing as a quick buck now in eastern Germany. It
will be a long hard slog,' says Deutsche Bank's Mr Krupp.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (9): Cross border deals
blossom / Review Franco-German financial relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the last working day of 1992, shareholders in Germany's second largest
insurance group approved the sale of Germany's sixth largest bank to Credit
Lyonnais, the large state-sector French bank.
The timing of the deal was charged with symbolism: shareholders in Aachener
und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), the second biggest insurance group in
Germany after the Allianz colossus, approved the sale of a majority stake in
BfG Bank to the French institution on the very eve of the formal opening of
the single European market.
This DM1.9bn transaction was linked with a second, related deal, bringing
AMB into a formal co-operation agreement with Assurances Generales de France
(AGF), a large French insurance company. This brought the management of AGF
on to the board of AMB, allowing it to exercise full control over a 25 per
cent stake in AMB - accumulated against the initial wishes of the German
company's management.
These two related deals were part of a series of cross-border alliances
forged between German and French financial institutions during the past
year. Companies from the two neighbouring countries have been taking steps
to make the single market a practical reality.
Three further examples of this are:
Dresdner Bank - Germany's second biggest bank - which has completed a
co-operation agreement with Banque Nationale de Paris.
The contract, which will be sealed with a 10-per cent cross-holding later
this year if BNP is privatised according to plan, provides for detailed
co-operation in a number of areas.
The two banks will make use of each others' home country branch networks.
They will pursue expansion into third countries jointly and they have
already formed joint banks in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Although contractual agreements of this sort are haunted by the memory of
the failure of a similar agreement between Credit Lyonnais and Commerzbank,
both parties are convinced that they have worked out the scope of the
co-operation to the smallest detail - and that the agreement is the best way
for both to expand beyond their home markets.
The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) - Germany's thriving electronic futures and
options exchange - is working with Matif, the French derivatives exchange,
on an ambitious plan to link their markets. Under the agreement, members of
the two exchanges will be able to trade each other's products. Matif will
also gain access to the DTB's screen-based dealing technology.
BHF-Bank, a Frankfurt-based institution which likes to call itself the
'German merchant bank', joined forces with Credit Commercial de France to
buy a 90 per cent stake in Charterhouse, a UK merchant bank. The Pounds 235m
deal represents a Franco-German initiative to build up a three-legged
cross-border merchant banking group.
The largest of the four transactions was the AGF/AMB and Credit Lyonnais/BfG
deal, completed only after months of horse-trading between some of France
and Germany's largest financial institutions. During this long-winded
process the chief executive of AMB lost his job, mainly because he opposed
the process of co-operation with the French.
For mergers and acquisitions followers it was a continental European treat:
the deals were done in back-rooms, far from the scrutiny of the financial
markets, with one supervisory board chief haggling with another.
In this battle of the giants the interests of minority shareholders were
hardly paramount.
UK merchant banking advisers played a role, but all too often a limited one:
SG Warburg advised Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, AMB's chief executive, on how to
stay independent of the French; the advice was to no avail - Baumgartl was
ousted by the pro-French chairman of his own supervisory board.
An added note of exoticism was provided by AMB's defence strategy, which was
to hide behind a special class of 'vinculated ' shares, which gave AMB the
right to decide who should have voting rights and who should not.
If the affair began last year on a distinctly unfriendly, non-European note,
relations between the insurance companies became more harmonious. The votes
on the vinculated shares were recognised after the French were able to
provide AMB with a solution to its BfG problem.
BfG-Bank - originally the Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft, a trades union bank -
came under AMB's control more than five years ago. The aim was for the bank
to sell the insurance company's products, but the venture into 'Allfinanz'
was ill-fated. The bank suffered from its exposure to the Co-Op retailer
(which nearly went bankrupt in 1989) and from high exposure to problem
country sovereign loans.
BfG-Bank cost its parent billions of D-Marks, and was a millstone around its
neck, especially at a time of change in the German insurance market.
But for Credit Lyonnais the opportunity to buy the bank, with 200 branches
in east and western Germany, represented a one-off chance to establish a
significant presence in the German banking market.
Thus all parties were happy when AMB introduced Credit Lyonnais - its fellow
state sector institution - as a buyer for BfG. In return, AGF won its
influence over the big German insurer.
The deal was opportunistic. But the net result was co-operation in keeping
with the spirit of the single market programme which took effect soon after
shareholders voted their approval at the end of last year.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (5): 'Lean-banking' is
the buzz word - Recession has not yet affected the prosperous banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ulrich Cartellieri, a board director at the Deutsche Bank, is fond of
arguing that the banking sector in Germany is potentially the steel industry
of the 1990s.
The thrust of his argument is that there are too many credit institutions in
Germany (4,453 at the end of 1991 - the latest figure provided by the
Bundesbank), and that this number must shrink over the course of the decade
amid a restructuring as drastic as that which has afflicted the European
steel industry.
As yet, however, there is very little evidence of his prediction coming
true. On the contrary, judging by the robust profits still being generated
by the larger, quoted German banks, the banking sector seems to be an island
of prosperity amid the deepening gloom of Germany's worst recession since
the war.
Germany's bigger banks all enjoyed a record year last year. The top five
quoted institutions posted annual increases in total operating profits
ranging from 7 per cent at Deutsche Bank (the biggest) to 21 per cent at
Commerzbank and 33 per cent at the Bayerische Vereinsbank.
Moreover, operating profits do not appear to have run out of momentum during
the current year. Deutsche Bank reported that total operating profits rose
by 'a good 20 per cent' in the first four months of 1993; Dresdner Bank (the
second biggest in Germany) has reported that profits increased by 15 per
cent over the same period and Commerzbank said that they climbed by more
than a quarter in the period from January to March.
The performance has been recognised by investors: the banking sector
(excluding Deutsche Bank) outperformed the German stock-market as a whole by
more than 17 per cent; Deutsche outperformed the market by 5 per cent
(reflecting the higher rating normally accorded to the bank by investors).
But how long can it continue?
Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist at the Commerzbank in Frankfurt, observes:
The increase in profits to record levels over the past two years reflects a
steep rise in the demand for credit - total bank lending to non-banks
excluding treasury bill credits grew by DM240bn last year - 8 per cent -
with a much higher rate of growth in medium and long-term credits.
Although demand for funds has reduced with the onset of tougher conditions
in the economy, it is still 'brisk,' says Pietsch, with DM10.6bn of new
credits granted in February.
This reflects a number of factors, including lower interest rates and the
continued availability of government subsidies to help finance investment in
eastern Germany. Another consideration is that increased public sector
borrowing is picking up the slack created by reduced demand for funds from
private companies.
Much of the increase in banks' total profits in the early months of this
year reflect buoyant equity and bund markets.
The DAX index of 30 leading shares climbed sharply in the early part of the
year and last year's bund rally through to the middle of April, with yields
on the 10-year Bund dropping to under 6.5 per cent from over 9 per cent in
the summer of last year. This benefited the banks on two counts: they
increased their fee income via providing securities-related services to
their clients, and they made profits for themselves via own-account
dealings.
These factors help explain the growth in operating profits in the past, and
provide some comfort for the outlook for the rest of the year. But to a
large extent, as Pietsch readily admits, the operating profits provide an
unrealistically positive picture of the German banking sector's prosperity -
because they are calculated before provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
It is understandable at a time of deepening recession, when the number of
bankruptcies has risen sharply, that the banks have been increasing their
provisions. By just how much is not clear: the banks do not disclose the
figure - although they will begin to do so later this summer, when they
release their full figures for the first six months of the year.
Analysts have already been able to make a guess at the scale of provisions,
following hints dropped by the banks' chief executives at recent press
conferences. Goldman Sachs, for example, calculates that provisions against
domestic credit risk doubled in 1992 to roughly 1 per cent of total lending.
This reflects an especially high increase in provisions to cover loans to
small and medium-sized businesses. Deutsche Bank disclosed that nearly three
quarters of its provisions were against loans for less than DM10m, mainly in
manufacturing.
Mr Ian McEwen, European bank analyst at Merrill Lynch, has studied the
numbers and come to the conclusion that net provisions as a proportion of
operating profits range from 43 per cent at Deutsche Bank to 64 per cent at
Dresdner Bank and a massive 95 per cent at Commerzbank.
McEwen says that in the light of the banks' poor disclosure policies these
calculations are 'subject to considerable uncertainty.' But he argues that
the truth about bank profitability is startling - only Deutsche, of the big
three banks, has a comfortable relationship between the net provisioning and
the level of profits.
'This means that the boom years for the German banks have already ended,'
says McEwen; but this has yet to feed through to the bottom line.
He predicts that strong lending and buoyant markets will enable the banks to
post further gains in operating profits this year. Next year, however, he
expects operating profits to fall by 10 to 15 per cent - although these
figures will not be disclosed until well into 1995. By then, the bad debts
situation will have deteriorated still further.
Pietsch, at Commerzbank, is adamant that by international standards the
German banking sector will continue to look relatively strong. 'We don't
have all the dramatic developments here in Germany that have afflicted the
banking sector in the US or Japan,' he says. 'Although there is a downturn
in the property sector, for example, there is no structural crisis.
'Of course industry is weak in Germany, but total industries are not
vanishing as they have in the US. Perhaps the only really dramatic
developments are in the machine tool sector - in the motor industry, by
contrast, we are experiencing a cyclical downturn rather than catastrophe.'
Moreover, Germany is not facing a savings and loans crisis of the kind
experienced in the US - nor do the banks have to deal with the aftermath of
imprudent lending to finance highly leveraged takeover transactions.
But, perhaps in recognition that more difficult times are head, the buzz
word in the German financial services sector at present is 'lean-banking':
after a period of years in which costs have risen sharply, banks are
beginning to take more care of cost management.
This can mean reducing staff levels: Commerzbank, for example, plans to
reduce its staff levels by 1,000 from 30,000 by the end of next year.
It has recently denied reports that it is planning to lay off twice as many
people as part of a slimming-down of its Frankfurt head office. That a
review of head office costs is underway is no secret: the McKinsey
consulting firm has prepared a report on the issue, and the Commerzbank
board will decide on rationalisation measures at the end of July.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (6): Tuned to the
single market / Profile of BHF's banking operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BHF-Bank is often described as a small, Frankfurt-based merchant bank - a
description which is in some ways misleading.
BHF is not that small: with assets of DM54bn at the end of last year it
ranks as Germany's eighth largest private sector bank.
And as Mr Wolfgang Strutz, its senior partner, concedes, it is not a
merchant bank in the English sense of the term.
It is highly active in mergers and acquisitions advice and other fee-earning
business, but the lion's share of its earnings comes from commercial
lending.
Furthermore, BHF may be based in Frankfurt, but with about 60 per cent of
lending going to international customers, it claims to have the most
international business profile of any German bank.
'In fact,' Mr Strutz says, 'we are one of a kind, very different from other
German financial institutions. This begins with our legal structure - six
general partners are personally liable for the bank's entire business - and
extends to the type of business we pursue.
'Like other large German institutions we are a universal bank, in that we
combine a large range of financial services under one roof; but we don't do
everything that a universal bank could do.
'We avoid small retail customers and steer clear of low-margin volume
business. Our target clients are businesses with turnover of DM100m or more
and high net worth individuals.'
The bank has had above average growth in profits over the last 10 years, is
represented in 12 German cities and had branches or subsidiaries in the
world's big financial and industrial centres.
Mr Strutz says that the bank's aim is to concentrate on four main business
areas: treasury activities, with currency trading operations in New York,
London, Tokyo and Frankfurt; commercial lending; asset management,
concentrating on the core markets of Germany, Switzerland and France; and
corporate finance.
BHF has taken two important strategic steps since the beginning of this
year, with the aim of bolstering its international corporate finance
activities and its domestic lending business.
First, together with its French associate Credit Commercial de France, BHF
will pay Pounds 235m to buy a 90 per cent stake in Charterhouse, a
London-based merchant bank.
Second, it forged a domestic co-operation agreement with IKB Deutsche
Industriekreditbank, a Dusseldorf-based bank which specialises in providing
long-term finance to small and medium-sized businesses.
The agreement is underpinned by a share exchange under which BHF took a 10
per cent stake in IKB, while IKB bought 3.5 per cent of BHF's shares.
Together the two institutions have total business volume of DM100bn
The acquisition of Charterhouse is the more ambitious of the two moves,
representing a determined attempt to build up a pan-European corporate
finance group.
'We are convinced that as the process of European union gathers pace,
cross-border mergers and acquisitions will become more important than ever
before,' Mr Strutz says, explaining the rationale behind the move.
'As medium-sized companies gear up to face the realities of a single market
they will face a growing need to seek external sources of capital and will
be increasingly obliged to seek third-party cross-border financial advice.
'We decided that the best way to tackle the market was not by setting up our
own subsidiary or taking a passive financial investment - but to make an
outright purchase.
'Either of us (BHF or CCF) could have done the deal on our own,' says Mr
Strutz, 'but this would have done no more than bring one institution's home
market into the equation. The way we have done it creates something unusual
 -a trilogy of corporate finance operations in London, Paris and Frankfurt.'
The aim is to make the services of this triple alliance available to BHF's
domestic client base - and also to the 8,000 medium-sized companies which
are clients of IKB.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (7): Need to respond
faster - Insurance is learning to live with EC directives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TREVOR PETCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE implementation of the EC third directives on life and non-life insurance
in July 1994 will represent a watershed for the German insurance industry.
Since the 19th century the authorities have regulated the market by detailed
supervision of policy terms and premium rates rather than the monitoring of
insurers' financial condition.
'As Brussels has opted for another market model, much closer to that of the
UK, we believe that we have to live with the consequences,' says Dr Bernd
Michaels, chairman of the German Insurers' Association (GDV). 'The task is
now to ensure that the directives are transformed into German law in such a
way that its insurers have a fair chance to compete,' he adds.
All leading German insurers share the view that big changes will ensue,
particularly in personal lines business. 'We are talking about a different
game,' says Dr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive of market leader
Allianz.
Companies will be forced to pay much more attention to policy development,
particularly in life insurance, and respond more rapidly to innovation as
both they and new market entrants are freed from the tight restriction of
the supervisory office in Berlin.
'For the first time in German insurance history underwriting of private
customer business will have to be creative,' says Mr Claas Kleyboldt,
chairman of Colonia Konzem, holding company of the Colonia and Nordstern
insurance groups.
At the same time, customers will be faced with more choice and more
difficult decisions. Both Dr Schulte-Noelle and Mr Kleyboldt see an
increased role for the insurance companies' agents, who dominate
distribution in Germany. The industry recognises that the agents' new role
is something more than simply a sales function and will require more
training, but it is determined to maintain control over this itself.
Germany currently has almost no control over the insurance sales process,
relying on close regulation of the insurers and on their own
image-consciousness. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been increasing
concern over dubious practices, particularly by some of the growing number
of independent sales companies and in the new states in eastern Germany.
An increase in price competition is also regarded as inevitable, with
equally far-reaching implications. Dr Knut Hohlfeld, president of the
Insurance Supervisory Office, acknowledged in an interview in February that
German insurers had been cross-subsidising low commercial insurance rates
with profits from private customer business, an allegation which the
industry itself consistently denies.
Nevertheless, with a view to the future after 1994, Mr Kleyboldt comments:
'I personally think that the best thing that could have happened was the
disaster in comprehensive motor insurance this year and last.' Increasing
car thefts - many for export to eastern Europe - together with losses from
eastern Germany, have led to heavy losses on motor insurance.
In response, insurers have set restrictions on the cover offered. They have
also pressed for rate increases, requesting between 10 per cent and 20 per
cent this year.
Companies are also seeking the right to increase premium rates during the
life of the policy - which is generally long by European standards. Mutual
insurers already have the ability to increase premiums at any time, by
membership vote.
Fewer changes are predicted in industrial lines. These are already open to
the single market, but with little effect on the traditional links between
German industry and German insurers. Part of the reason, according to Dr
Michaels, is that policies were already of international standard and prices
had become so low that few outsiders were interested in competing for
business.
Industrial, fire, and loss of profit lines have suffered heavy losses. Since
1991 German insurers have finally begun to demand premium increases, which
have risen by 30 per cent to 40 per cent. In the past, big industrial
conglomerates have been able to demand cheap cover and very small
deductibles, while using so-called in-house insurance brokers to earn a
profitable commission.
Insurers are now demanding increases at time when their clients are under
severe financial pressures of other kinds. As a result, in the longer term
there may be important changes in how German companies insure. Already some
are trading off increased deductibles against a smaller increase in premium
rates.
German industry has also been relatively insulated from the increasing use
of captive insurers and other self-funding mechanisms. In the UK, the US and
Sweden, half of all cover for big industry is carried out like this this The
Customs House Dock financial services centre in Dublin has been a particular
beneficiary of the increase in German-owned captives, and the trend can be
expected to continue.
Another effect of these changes is increased attention to reducing
administrative expenses, partly to counterbalance rising claims costs. Dr
Schulte-Noelle also draws an explicit connection with increasing price
competition for personal customer business, as well as the pressure exerted
on cost ratios by the development of new business and, especially,
supporting the new market in eastern Germany.
Attempts to win market share from Allianz's local subsidiary, Deutsche
Versicherungs, the successor to the former state monopoly insurer, has
generated heavy losses for some insurers which marketed policies at a heavy
discount.
Germany has successfully demanded from the EC special dispensations to
maintain its traditional insurance accounting procedures. The lowest value
principle (which enables German insurers and reinsurers to build up large
hidden capital reserves in addition to the compulsory but tax-efficient
special reserves against fluctuations in underwriting results) will be
maintained. So will the ban on discounting loss reserves.
Together these 'have led to the high safety margin we have had in Germany
for decades,' Dr Michaels says. The insurance accounting directive will
force German insurers to disclose the market value of their assets, but is
expected to delay implementation of this directive for as long as possible -
probably to the end of the decade. Such disclosure could lead to a kind of
rating or competition between insurers over the level of hidden reserves. Dr
Michaels thinks that this would be to the industry's disadvantage.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (4): Technology is the
weapon against London - Frankfurt's stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S spectacular failure to develop its Taurus settlement system has
brought cheer to the hearts of Frankfurt financiers eager to challenge
London's primacy as Europe's leading financial centre.
The reason is that London's failure to devise an electronic way of
'dematerialising' share settlement has highlighted what German financiers
believe to be the Frankfurt financial markets' superior technological edge
over London.
While the German securities markets have suffered under a number of
competitive disadvantages - such as a strict regulatory regime which has
discouraged financial innovation and a lack of investor-oriented supervision
 -technology has been a central weapon in the battle with London.
The aim of the campaign has been to win back market share in German
securities - in equities, bonds and derivatives - from London to Germany.
These efforts will be intensified further with the future development of the
Deutsche Borse AG, Germany's unified stock-exchange structure, which came
into being at the beginning of the year.
There are two important areas in which Germany's financial institutions have
invested heavily in technology:
The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), a fully-screen based trading system for
future and options.
This has existed for only three and a half years, but in that time has
mounted a vigorous challenge to Liffe, London's open-outcry derivatives
market, Europe's largest.
The total number of contracts handled by DTB climbed from 6.8m in 1990 to
34.8m last year (confounding critics who said that a screen-based system
would not function in hectic market conditions).
It has 79 member institutions - about 40 per cent of these are non-German -
and it is expanding beyond Germany with a recent agreement to link up with
Matif, its French equivalent.
A fully electronic system is more technologically advanced than one where
brokers shout and wave their arms about amid an avalanche of paper, as at
Liffe.
But having the technological edge has not necessarily given the DTB the
business advantage: in May this year 70 per cent of the business in the
crucial Bund future is still done in London rather than over the DTB.
This worries German financiers, because it is likely that much of the
business in 10-year German government securities is also done in London.
But the DTB struck back with a medium-term government bond future (the
Bobl). The DTB dominates this market, with a share of 80 per cent, although
Liffe introduced a competing product in January this year.
It has always been somewhat irksome to German financiers that London, a
centre for international equity trading as well as for UK equities, should
have captured much of the business in German shares via the Seaq
International price display system, which requires a telephone call to
execute an order.
One reason why fund managers may have been driven to execute their
transactions in blue-chip German stocks via London rather than Germany is
because of the lack of securities-market supervision in Germany. Another was
the fragmentation of liquidity and visibility between the eight exchanges
now merged into the new Deutsche Borse structure.
Technology alone could not overcome these obstacles - which are being dealt
with - but the introduction of the Ibis screen dealing system for Germany's
leading share and bond issues in April 1991 has succeeded in pulling back
business from London.
London's share of business in Germany's 30 leading shares has dropped from
14 per cent in 1989 to 10.25 per cent last year, says Mr Rudiger von Rosen,
chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, citing Bank of England statistics. He
attributes this success to the Ibis system, which within Germany now has a
44 per cent market share of turnover in the leading shares, more than twice
the level only a year ago.
Last summer, it appeared that Ibis would not be the last word in the
development of electronic trading systems for the German securities markets.
Details of a study commissioned by the Frankfurt stock exchange leaked out,
suggesting that during the 1990s Germany would move to a fully paperless
system for equity trading.
The report, conducted by the McKinsey consulting firm, proved too radical.
Floor-based trading systems are to remain, assisted by technological
innovations such as the recently introduced, so-called, Boss-Cube
order-routeing system, which has been designed to eliminate the paper flow
associated with a share order.
But the new Deutsche Borse is to be used to develop a 'one-stop' shop for
the purchase of equities, bonds and derivatives, together with settlement
services. It can only be brought about by further advances in technology.
This was made clear by Mr Rolf Breuer, chairman of the Deutsche Borse and
head of securities at Deutsche Bank, when he used his influence to appoint a
successor to Mr von Rosen as chief executive.
Von Rosen, a former head of public relations at the Bundesbank, is to be
replaced later this year by Mr Werner Seifert, a Swiss citizen who is now
head of Swiss Re's primary insurance business. Until 1987 Mr Siefert was a
partner at McKinsey. His background in technology and finance is thought to
be the decisive factor behind his appointment.
The organisation which he will head up from next August this year is a
holding structure which brings the Frankfurt stock exchange, Germany's
largest, under the same roof as the DTB and the Deutscher Kassenverein, the
German settlement system.
Whatever advances are yet to be made, the Germans are pleased that they do
not have to follow London's example and develop a dematerialised share
transfer system - they have this in the Kassenverein already.
It offers settlement within 48 hours - and if the order is put in early
enough, within the same trading day.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (3): Shareholders on
sidelines - David Waller studies Germany's corporate style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A couple of anecdotes give a flavour of the deep divide between the
Anglo-American style of capitalism and the Germanic approach.
First, a British magazine reports that the newly-anointed chief executive of
a big German bank spilt some Blutwurst sausage on his new shirt just before
an important engagement. The report, far from being laughed off, becomes the
subject of debate at the bank's next board meeting. How dare Anglo-Saxon
journalists write about such an important personage in this way? The bank
contemplates cutting back its - already minimal - contact with the
international press still further.
Next, the finance director of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest company,
casually tells this writer what the group's profit figures are going to be
this year and next.
The banker's sensitivity to the Blutwurst story, in the first example,
highlights more than mere lack of sense of humour. It reflects the tendency
of senior German management to be removed from criticism of any kind - not
just about their eating habits but also their financial performance.
In the second, the willingness to let slip highly sensitive information is
indicative of a cavalier approach to the mass of shareholders. It can be
taken for granted that Germany's big banks and insurance companies - which
own large stakes in numerous large German companies - know the figures long
before they slip out in the interviews and presentations. Other shareholders
are not so well served.
But there is no point in becoming morally indignant about the way corporate
Germany works. The stock market simply does not have the importance for the
German economy, and for German companies that it does for the economy and
companies in other countries - with profound consequences for the way
companies are managed.
While the German economy accounts for 25 per cent of the European
Community's GNP, and 24 per cent of its population, the market
capitalisation is only 16 per cent of the European total. There are only 665
companies on the German market; at the end of last year they were
capitalised at about Dollars 333bn, accounting for 18.6 per cent of
Germany's GNP. In the US, the market accounts for 66.4 per cent of GNP, in
Japan 62 per cent and in the UK nearly 99 per cent.
German entrepreneurs prefer not to come to the stock-market. They are averse
to becoming the slaves of short-term profits expectations - and they do not
like the personal publicity which comes from having a stock-market listing.
When a business reaches the point where an infusion of external equity
capital would help it grow, it often decides not to grow any further. Or it
sells itself to one of Germany's many family-controlled industrial holdings
groups.
Entrepreneurs who do seek a market listing make sure that control stays with
management rather than the market. A typical move would be to list only 25
per cent of the share capital.
Even much bigger companies try to make sure that control does not pass away
from a few friendly (usually German institutions) to the equity market as a
whole. There is an emphasis on 'shareholder stability' - that is, arranging
matters so that there is no possibility of management becoming unsettled via
unfriendly takeovers.
Pressure on management to perform is exerted by the banks and insurance
companies which dominate German supervisory boards. The yardstick by which
management performance is measured is not published profits: the supervisory
board will have access to internal measures of profit performance. There are
other criteria, too, by which the success of a company will be judged: for
example, capital expenditure; growth in turnover; contribution to the local
community; improvement in friendliness to the environment.
The debate over management performance takes place behind closed doors.
There is little need for management to justify its actions to a broader
cross-section of shareholders - except perhaps at ritualised events such as
the annual press conference or meeting of shareholders.
Communications policy at some of Germany's larger listed companies is
changing. 'Investor relations' and 'shareholder value' are terms
increasingly bandied about by by senior German managers. Partly this is
lip-service - but it does reflect a growing readiness to take the interests
of foreign institutional shareholders seriously.
These investors own between 40 and 50 per cent of the small free-float on
the German stock-market, and a high percentage of shares in some large,
individual companies. As yet they are not represented on the supervisory
boards of the companies that they partially own. This means that their
interests are perhaps not protected at the heart of the German system of
corporate governance; but then few, if any, Anglo-American investors would
be willing to make the long-term commitment to a company implicit in taking
a supervisory board role.
Despite this lack of formal representation, there are signs of a gradual
convergence between the Anglo-American way of doing things (where the
shareholder comes first) and the German way (where the interests of ordinary
shareholder have tended to come close to the bottom of the pile of
management priorities).
This is brought on by two linked factors: the German recession and the
likelihood that German companies will need to tap international equity
markets for capital.
The recession is making managers realise the importance of making money as
well as generating sales. Restructuring is generating a need for capital
which cannot be met from cash-flows as in the past. The capital is not so
readily available from the increasingly cautious banking community - and
public sector borrowing requirements are likely to keep up the cost of
borrowing over the rest of this decade.
The source of capital at the margin is the international fund manager;
companies will have to adapt themselves to meet his or her wishes if that
capital is to be forthcoming.
Talk about shareholder value is a symptom of this. More telling is
Daimler-Benz's decision to seek a listing on the New York stock exchange.
This will require the company to be more forthcoming with sensitive
financial information than in the past and will expose it more closely to
the criticisms of Anglo-American investors. In return Daimler will be able
to raise equity capital more cheaply and more widely than its competitors.
As yet, other German companies have yet to follow suit, but Gerhard Liener,
Daimler's finance director, predicts that other big German companies will be
obliged to make the step soon.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (2): Team strategy
unchanged - Christopher Parkes notes a friction-free transition at the
Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE substitutes are warming up and will be on the field soon. One thing is
certain: when they take over this autumn, team strategy will remain
unchanged. As for tactics - that depends on the pressure from the opponents.
The recent confirmation of Mr Hans Tietmeyer as the next president of the
Bundesbank and the nomination of Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum as his number two
ensures a friction-free transition at the top of Europe's most influential
central bank and a seamless continuation of the central bank's rigorous
policy.
Mr Tietmeyer, it is said, differs only from his predecessor Mr Helmut
Schlesinger in that he prefers to take the lift rather than walk up the 12
floors to his Frankfurt office. On the issues that matter - the stability of
the D-Mark and the credibility of the Bundesbank - he could be a Schlesinger
clone.
Mr Gaddum, his dry, low-profile vice-president, is more of an unknown. But
in his current job in the Bundesbank directorate, in charge of money and
credit, he has proved himself a skilled monetary manager - equally dedicated
to the issues that matter.
Mr Gaddum's department has been mainly responsible over past months for
engineering the application of the Bundesbank's interest rates policy,
comprising a series of sporadic small steps downwards (what Mr Otmar Issing,
Mr Gaddum,'s directorate colleague, recently called 'dribbling'). Mr Gaddum
was also the prime mover behind the bank's decision to reduce minimum
reserve requirements under which banks were obliged to deposit up to 12 per
cent of their customer deposits, interest-free, with the central bank. He
himself said the move would help German banks' competitiveness. Others
described the changes as a 'tremendous' boost.
Outsiders are somewhat more reserved about his management of interest rates.
In most of the moves this year so far, Mr Gaddum's team has first steered
down long-term money market rates, by meticulous fine-tuning of the rates at
which the Bundesbank supplies funds to commercial banks. This has opened up
scope for the bank to execute judicious reductions in the
internationally-important short-term discount and lombard rates. The process
has been vociferously supported by his colleagues, who continually point out
that 80 per cent of German borrowings are tied to the long-term rates.
Unconvinced foreign politicians and industrialists have pleaded in vain for
bigger, more frequent cuts on the basis that a German lead will allow
reductions elsewhere which in turn will help fuel recovery from recession.
Appeals from within Germany, where the Bundesbank is viewed as the country's
most trustworthy institution, have been relatively few.
Taken to task on its 'international obligations' the bank presented a
united, stubborn front. Lower interest rates were not the only or the most
effective way to help recovery, it said. For lasting growth and lasting
stability, each country had first to put its own house in order  - Germany
in particular.
In paraphrase: instead of concentrating on rising insolvencies and
unemployment and falling company profits, politicians should consider the
deeper symptoms of malaise. Most of all the bank denounces runaway public
sector deficits which 'crowd out' potential private sector investors from
capital markets.
The Bundesbank was particularly angered by the German government's first
attempt at producing a so-called solidarity pact. From a design draft for a
package of spending cuts which was intended to help Germany fund recovery in
the east, the Bonn government, in cahoots with the opposition, employers and
unions, concocted a range of new taxes and levies which will cost
individuals and companies the equivalent of 2 per cent of gross domestic
product a year.
The bank, acknowledging the political will which had gone into generating
the agreement, reacted with admirable restraint. Chancellor Helmut Kohl had
made important political gains, but he had ignored Frankfurt's persistent
warnings that spending cuts had to come before tax rises.
When it became clear, in late spring, that the holes in the federal budgets
were too big to be filled by the proposed tax increases (an estimated
DM100bn of savings was required until the end of 1996), the bank had had
enough. It stopped 'dribbling' with interest rates and resumed vigorous
campaigning for real cuts. Ostensibly addressing the world at large, but
clearly berating the Bonn government, Mr Schlesinger and his colleagues
pulled no punches. They proposed that unemployment pay should be reduced and
suggested that countries building up their social welfare systems should
slow the process and consider whether they were on the right track.
In response to calls for public spending programmes to promote growth, Mr
Issing suggested the proponents should stop trying to fool themselves into
believing that such projects created anything more than a flash in the pan.
All that was left after the flash, he said, was a residue of debt which had
to be serviced. It would be far better to stop subsidising 'dying'
industries: steel, shipbuilding and agriculture for a start.
The Bundesbank seldom uses such direct language, but its temper has been
tested by critics at home in Germany who seem to suggest that it should
abandon, temporarily at least, the policies which, for 30 years and more,
have helped keep German inflation and unemployment lower than almost
anywhere else in the industrialised world.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (1): Determined to give
a lead in Europe - Financial services have escaped recession so far / bank
profits are up, the Bundesbank is steadfast against inflation and the
private sector strengthens Germany as a financial centre

FRANKFURT is now the undisputed financial capital of Germany. Is it on the
verge of becoming the financial capital of Europe?
German financiers, industrialists and politicians hope that Frankfurt will
be formally anointed in this role sometime later this year, when European
Community countries finally make up their collective mind where to locate
the future European Central Bank.
But to a large extent, whether the new institution is to be located in the
city or not, Frankfurt already occupies the position of Europe's financial
capital - because of the authority of the Bundesbank.
Mit Beharrlichkeit - 'with ruthless determination and singlemindedness,' as
they say in Germany - the Bundesbank has fought a successful battle with
inflation for decades. Hence its unmatched credibility in the financial
world.
Since last autumn, when the Bundesbank's refusal to give way to widespread
calls for cheaper money led to turmoil on international currency markets and
to the partial break-up of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), that
credibility has weakened.
Germany is wrestling with a deep recession. It is belatedly counting the
cost of the 1990 reunification of the two halves of the country. Inflation
is running at an annual rate of about 4 per cent; more than twice the
central bank's target of 2 per cent, and higher than in many European
countries with less discipline in such matters.
In late June the D-Mark hit a 15 month low against the US dollar and the
French took the opportunity to cut their rates to below German levels (the
first time in 26 years that the French have been able to do so). French
government officials talk about the possibility of the franc displacing the
D-Mark as the anchor currency for the ERM. So far this has not happened. De
facto, European interest rates are still set by the members of the
Bundesbank council at their meetings on alternate Thursdays.
Calls from the French economics ministry late last month for 'co-ordinated
talks ' with Germany over easing monetary policy received short shrift from
the Germans. Theo Waigel, the finance minister, politely reminded the French
that the Bundesbank's independence was inviolable and cancelled a planned
meeting with his French opposite number in Paris.
Although interest rates have eased since last autumn (the discount rate is
down from a high of 8.75 per cent in July last year to 7.25 per cent now,
and is widely expected to be down to 5 or 6 per cent by the end of the year)
there has been no great reversal of the huge flow of international money
invested in the D-Mark in 1992-93. Economists calculate that foreign
investors invested DM190bn in the D-Mark in the 14 months to the end of
February this year, more than twice the level in 1991, the previous record
year.
This inflow helped to propel a big rally in the price of German Bunds, where
yields tumbled from over 9 per cent to a low point of 6.45 per cent in
mid-April. Since then prices have dropped and the yield is back up at about
6.75 - but in spite of pessimistic forecasts, yields of 7 per cent or higher
have not yet come to pass.
The influx also helped the profits of the Frankfurt-based financial
community. While the impetus to record profits last year at the large
commercial banks came from growth in lending business, trading gains and
commission income from securities business are the reason for double digit
increases in the banks' total operating profits over the early months of the
year.
This has allowed banks to predict 'satisfactory' earnings for the year as a
whole, meaning that these big financial conglomerates - along with
construction companies - count as one of the few sectors in the stricken
German economy to be generating healthy profits growth at this point in the
economic cycle.
The healthiness of banks' profits is exaggerated by the fact that they do
not disclose their full exposure to bad and doubtful debts. Provisions are
undoubtedly climbing - and will be revealed for the first time in some
detail when the banks report their interim figures later this summer.
But whatever the true picture of banks' earnings, they are not on the verge
of the structural crisis afflicting German manufacturing industry.
Notwithstanding predictions of a shake-out in Germany's banking community,
the only real consolidation is in the public sector, with the
Dusseldorf-based Westdeutsche Landesbank acting as catalyst to a series of
mergers and new strategic alliances among state-sector institutions.
The German financial services sector as a whole, which encompasses regional
financial centres in cities such as Munich, Dusseldorf and Hamburg, has
benefited from a series of recent measures designed to strengthen
Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre.
These include the creation of Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange  -
from the beginning of this year. This has been put together on the
initiative of the Frankfurt exchange, the biggest of the eight exchanges in
Germany, where about 70 per cent of total German securities turnover is
conducted.
The new body brings the Frankfurt Exchange and the DTB Deutsche Terminborse
(the German futures and options exchange) together under the same roof as
the Deutscher Kassenverein settlements organisation. Some 40 per cent of the
new organisation is owned by regional (non-Frankfurt) banks and the seven
regional stock exchanges (excluding Frankfurt).
According to Rolf Breuer, the first chairman of the German Exchange, this
gives Germany one of the most modern stock-exchange structures in the world
 -the only exchange which brings equities and futures trading under the same
roof as settlement services. The focus of future development will be on
technology, to bring out the benefits of this structure; benefits which,
Breuer admits, are latent rather than actual at present.
German financiers have laid heavy emphasis on technology. For example, they
have spent tens of millions of D-Marks on the development of the
screen-based DTB, founded only three and a half years ago, and on Ibis, a
computerised share-dealing service for leading equity and fixed interest
issues.
Since the service was introduced, in April 1991, this has become the second
biggest exchange in Germany, accounting for 30 per cent of trade in leading
German shares. According to Mr Rudiger von Rosen, the outgoing chief
executive of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Ibis has also succeeded in
pulling back a significant amount of business in German shares from London
to Germany.
But in the battle with other financial centres, German financiers recognise
that the regulatory environment must be improved.
On the one hand this means a tightening of regulation. Next year Germany
will finally get legislation which will make insider dealing a criminal
offence, and create the German equivalent of the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission, the body which regulates the US securities industry.
Calls for these measures have intensified since union chief Franz
Steinkuhler was forced to resign as head of IG Metall after he bought DM1m
shares in a Daimler holding company shortly before the shares enjoyed a
sharp increase in value.
He has denied insider dealing based on information gleaned from his former
position as member of the Daimler supervisory board. But the affair
highlighted the absence of law forbidding the practice.
On the other hand, Finanzplatz Deutschland is clamouring for deregulation
which will allow its institutions to compete more vigorously with their
rivals in London or Luxemburg. The chief complaint is against minimum
reserve requirements, which oblige banks to lodge funds with the Bundesbank
whenever they take a deposit, making it difficult for them to compete with
banks based where such reserves are not required.
The Bundesbank obligingly halved the requirement earlier in February this
year. It may do away with the requirements altogether after Mr Hans
Tietmeyer succeeds Mr Helmut Schlesinger as president of the central bank on
October 1.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: Elusive harmony / Assessing 20 years of
progress towards global standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMANUEL EMENYONU and SIDNEY GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the International Accounting Standards Committee celebrates its 20th
anniversary this week, it is an appropriate time to consider how much
progress has been made towards achieving the objective of promoting
international accounting harmonisation.
Shortly after its creation in 1973, the IASC predicted in a progress report:
'Provided that the initial enthusiasm and thrust with which the IASC was
started is continued, its impact in the years to come will be important. It
will take perhaps five to 10 years before its full effects are recognised,
but after that they will increase each year. Accounts issued in every
important nation of the world will comply with the standards promulgated by
the IASC or will disclose the extent to which there has been
non-compliance.' In retrospect, this may seem to have been an optimistic
prediction. In practice IASC standards have often been flexible. They have
also been difficult to enforce given its lack of influence in many countries
where professional accounting organisations are permitted only a relatively
minor role in standard setting.
Any progress in international accounting harmonisation, or lack of it, is of
course not just the responsibility of the IASC. Many other agencies are
involved, including the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, and the European Community. But the IASC is
perhaps the only organisation to claim prime responsibility for promoting
international accounting harmonisation around the world.
How much progress has the IASC made? What have been the successes and what
are the remaining problems? Some insights into these questions can be gained
from the results of our recently completed survey of five countries -
France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the USA - covering 26 accounting
measurement issues over the period 1971/72 to 1991/92. The aim was to assess
progress in the last 20 years.
The sample covered 293 large listed companies reporting in both 1971/72 and
1991/92. The breakdown was: 25 from France, 42 from Germany, 54 from Japan,
82 from the UK and 96 from the US. Given the size and significance of these
companies and the importance of the countries involved, which are among the
largest economies and stock markets around the world, it would seem
reasonable to expect that the impact of efforts to harmonise accounting
internationally would be clearly discernible. Indeed, this is the kindest
sample to choose, since a much tougher test of harmonisation would be to
look at all member states of the IASC and to include both large and small
companies, listed and unlisted.
We examined the annual reports in the sample published during 1971-72 and
1991-92 and highlighted a total of 26 accounting measurement issues. A
'harmony index' was constructed for each measure, to assess the extent of
international harmonisation. This index provides a range of values from zero
for extreme diversity to one for an absolute uniformity of accounting
methods.
Its calculation uses a variant of the Herfindahl index, a measure of
concentration which has previously been used to study harmonisation. It is
derived by multiplying the relative frequency of use of a particular
accounting method across the countries and adding the results for all
alternative methods. A summary of our findings in the table shows that
progress towards harmonisation over the last 20 years has been mixed. Taken
overall, it has been quite modest, with an increase in the average harmony
index score from a moderate level of 0.6230 to only 0.6903. This is an
average increase in international accounting harmonisation of only 10.8 per
cent from 1971-72 to 1991-92.
There were only 14 issues showing an increase in harmonisation. In 12 cases
there was in fact a reduction in harmonisation or a higher level of
accounting diversity. There are significant increases in treatment of
consolidation, exchange differences, the treatment of gains/losses on
long-term investments, and the treatment of research and development
expenditures.
It is also noteworthy that there is a relatively high level of harmonisation
in respect of investments in associates, the treatment of gains/losses on
the disposal of property, plant and equipment, the treatment of gains and
losses on the disposal of current investments, and accounting for
extraordinary and exceptional items.
Significant decreases include the treatment of goodwill, the costing of
inventories, the method of depreciation, the valuation of long-term
investments, the treatment of borrowing costs, the basis for providing for
deferred taxes and the method of determining the cost of pensions. There is
a relatively low level of harmonisation in respect of the costing of
inventories, accounting for depreciation, and the basis for providing for
deferred taxes.
Despite 20 years of effort, clearly there are substantial continuing
problems facing those promoting international accounting harmonisation.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Poorest Britons see income drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REAL income of the poorest 10 per cent of Britons fell after housing
costs by 14 per cent between 1979 and 1990-91, government figures showed
yesterday.
Publication of the figures in the Department of Social Security's Households
Below Average Income statistics provides further proof of a growing
disparity in incomes since the Tories came to power.
Incomes of the population as a whole rose by about 35 per cent in real terms
between 1979 and 1990-91. The share of total income of the poorer half of
the population dropped over the same period. In 1979 the poorer 50 per cent
accounted for 32 per cent of total income after housing costs. By 1990-91
this had declined to 25 per cent. The poorest 10 per cent saw their 1979
share of total income - 4 per cent after housing costs - almost halve to 2.1
per cent by the early 1990s.
There have been considerable changes since 1979 in the types of people who
make up the poorest 10 per cent. There are fewer pensioners but the
proportion of unemployed families has grown from about 15 per cent of the
bottom 10 per cent in 1979 to 28 per cent now. People living in
institutions, bed-and-breakfast accommodation or living rough are not
included in the group.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the figures showed that
there had been 'real and substantial' increases for every family type and
economic group. He added: 'The figures do not show the poor are getting
poorer.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, replied: 'It is a shaming
story compounded by the department's claim that the figures do not show the
poor are getting poorer.'

FT  01 JUL 93 / Rise in business travel expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST COMPANIES expect business travel to rise this year, but staff will
travel in less comfort than during the depths of the recession, a survey
carried out by Surrey University for Thomas Cook, the travel agents, has
found.
The survey of 140 companies found that 77.6 per cent expect to spend more on
business travel this year. But the proportion of staff permitted to fly club
class will be lower than in previous years.
Only 14.9 per cent of the companies surveyed now allow all staff to fly club
class throughout the world, compared with 25.4 per cent a year ago. Only
13.4 per cent expect to permit club class flying for all staff in 12 months
time.
The proportion insisting that all staff fly economy class is now 3 per cent,
the same as a year ago. In 12 months, however, 9 per cent of companies say
they will be requiring all staff to fly economy.
Only 14.9 per cent of companies allow business travellers freely to choose
their airline. The Association of British Travel Agents has decided against
proposals to reduce its role in spite of a vote in favour by its members.
Abta members voted 55 per cent in favour of becoming a purely regulatory
body, handling consumer complaints but not representing the industry in
negotiations with government. But Abta's national council said the change
would require a 75 per cent majority at an extraordinary general meeting.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Twisting the arm of the law: Proposals set out
uncompromising agenda for reforming the police
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS FOR the police that discuss the replacement of 'jobs for life'
with fixed-term contracts, the introduction of performance-related pay and
the abolition of three senior ranks head an uncompromising agenda for reform
published yesterday.
The government-appointed Sheehy inquiry into police rewards and
responsibilities calls for a severance scheme costing Pounds 200m-Pounds
300m over three years to shed 5,000 middle-ranking and senior officers by
voluntary or compulsory redundancy.
Under the existing police structure, concludes the committee, forces have
little encouragement to manage their resources. Detailed central systems of
financial, staffing and managerial controls prevent 'the sensible exercise
of local discretion and the introduction of change'.
The committee proposes a radical array of changes designed to produce a
results-driven police service that focuses on patrol constables and other
frontline officers who provide the core services.
A need to encourage more flexible management structures, allow for lateral
as well as vertical career development, reflect individual responsibilities
and 'reward good performance and penalise bad' are among the objectives
which, the Sheehy committee says, determined the inquiry's approach.
It says the police service has become managerially top-heavy particularly
because, compared with other jobs, a unique amount of day-to-day
decision-making is devolved down the line to the constable on the beat. As a
result, the committee recommends the abolition of the posts of chief
inspector, chief superintendent and deputy chief constable. The committee
says it is not suggesting all the jobs done by present occupants of these
posts are unnecessary. Police forces should decide which officers are best
suited to fill posts in the new structure.
Basic police pay levels should, the committee recommends, be based on the
median level of private-sector non-manual pay - the upper quartile was
'rejected partly on the grounds of affordability'. This would replace a link
with average industrial earnings under the existing police pay formula.
Chief officers would have flexibility to adjust national increases to local
requirements.
Police entry salaries, the committee concludes, are now 'well above the
market' - 148 per cent of the median. It proposes dropping the lowest entry
salary. This would cut the starting rate for an entrant by about Pounds
2,000 to Pounds 10,630 and - combined with another proposal to abolish
housing allowances for entrants - would leave a recruit substantially worse
off than now.
The committee says that while it does not underrate the difficulty of
performance measurement in the police service, 'we cannot see how there can
be a real prospect of any organisation meeting its performance targets
unless those working within it have a clear view of the part they are to
play'. Performance measures for individual officers play a crucial part in
achieving this.
Four variables should be taken into account when relating pay to
responsibilities - scope of the role; particular policing circumstances such
as the risk of assault in a specific job; requirements for special skills,
experience and training; and individual performance related to a proposed
appraisal system. Application of such factors could, for example, lead to
officers being paid more if they volunteered to work on housing estates with
problems of violence.
Weighting of these factors, says the committee, would provide the basis for
a new system of pay scales. One-off individual and team bonuses would be
available.
Performance should, says the committee, 'play a particularly key role in
pay' at superintendent level and above. Up to 30 per cent of the pay of
chief constables and assistant chief constables would be linked to
performance-related bonuses.
The committee recommends that new recruits should be employed on fixed-term
contracts - initially for 10 years, with subsequent five-yearly renewals.
Serving officers would have the opportunity to transfer to fixed-term
contracts voluntarily, and would in any case do so if they transferred on
promotion to a new force.
Police sick pay is now unlimited. This would be replaced by a limit of six
months on full pay followed by six months on half pay, subject to extension
or reduction in individual cases. Many allowances would cease, while much
overtime would disappear into the proposed new basis for relating pay to the
demands of particular jobs.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Police threaten 'open conflict': Sheehy urges radical
shake-up of existing structure - Officers warn of consequences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was warned by the Police Federation yesterday that it risked
'open conflict' with the police service if it adopted radical proposals for
changing pay and conditions of employment.
Recommendations from a government-appointed inquiry chaired by Sir Patrick
Sheehy, chairman of BAT industries, constitute one of the most radical
packages of change ever proposed in the public sector. It would lead to all
police officers eventually being employed on limited-term contracts, with
pay related to individual performance and the demands of particular jobs.
The Police Federation, which represents all officers up to the rank of chief
inspector, said that the Sheehy recommendations would turn police work from
a vocation into a 'job like any other job'. That would have serious
implications for the way the service operated.
The prospect of conflict was also recognised in a comment by Mr Eric Caines,
a member of the Sheehy inquiry team and former industrial relations director
of the National Health Service. He said the public sector was 'notorious' in
its attitude to change, and many hurdles would have to be overcome before
the recommendations were implemented.
The Police Superintendents' Association warned: 'If the recommendations are
implemented we will not be able to recruit, retain and motivate officers of
the best quality.' But a more positive initial reaction came from Mr John
Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of the Association of Chief
Police Officers. He welcomed the recommendations for a new pay formula and
more managerial freedom for chief constables.
The report - combined with Monday's Home Office white paper proposing the
restructuring of police authorities on more businesslike lines and other
changes - sets the scene for the biggest programme of police reform in
modern times.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will consider reactions to the report
until September before making final decisions on its 272 recommendations.
Many of the proposed changes would require legislation, and a bill is likely
in the autumn.
Introducing the report yesterday, Sir Patrick said that promotion was now
the only reward for efficiency in the police. He said that the system of pay
awards related to length of service was not conducive to efficiency.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Taiwan group plans Pounds 26m plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CMC Magnetics Corporation, one of Taiwan's largest electronics companies,
yesterday announced it is to set up a Pounds 26m floppy-disk production
plant in Cramlington, Northumberland, creating 550 jobs over three years.
The plant will receive Pounds 8.25m in Regional Selective Assistance and is
expected to have an annual output of 120m disks.
The project is the fifth manufacturing investment from Taiwan in the UK and
the third in Northumberland. Mr John Bridge, chief executive of Northern
Development Company, the economic regeneration body, said: 'We've got a
leading edge and we intend to keep it.'
The decision by CMC's subsidiary Europa Magnetic Corporation to site the
plant in north-east England would give a strong signal to other Taiwanese
companies, he said. The main rival for the project was the Irish Republic.
CMC holds 10 per cent of the world market for floppy disks and is also a
large producer of videotape. Cramlington will be its first big manufacturing
plant outside Taiwan. Mr Wilfred Sing, CMC's UK accountant, said the
rationale behind the plant was to replace Far East imports with
European-made goods.
CMC has not yet decided its policy on union representation at Cramlington.
Production starts in the autumn at the plant, an English Estates factory
built to attract inward investment. A hundred jobs will be created in the
first year.

FT  01 JUL 93 / One in 10 newly qualified teachers 'unsuited' for job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN 10 newly qualified teachers is 'unsuited to teaching', according to
the Office for Standards in Education.
In its first report on the standards of new teachers since Her Majesty's
Inspectorate became a part of Ofsted earlier this year, the watchdog said
the finding 'raises the crucial question of how these students were selected
for training, allowed to complete their course successfully, and gain
appointments'.
It added: 'Both the training institutions and the schools share the
responsibility.'
The inspectors found that those teachers unsuited to the profession were
predominantly unaware that they were unsuited, and that heads also failed to
realise their prob-lems.
Only 54 per cent of new primary teachers felt adequately prepared to teach
reading. The inspectors further called for more work using information
technology to support teaching.
The Department for Education, which is planning to make changes to teacher
training, said the survey highlighted the need for close scrutiny of initial
teacher train-ing.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, announced proposals to reform
initial teacher training last month which would include more school-based
training for teachers, and new qualifications.
He also advocated relaxing the requirement that teachers of infants should
be graduates. Teachers for children of all other ages would still need to be
graduates, according to the proposals.
Teachers' associations said the Ofsted findings showed that the present
teacher training system was working well.
They pointed to the finding that 71 per cent of lessons taught by new
secondary teachers and 73 per cent by new primary teachers were judged to be
satisfactory or better.
Mr Jeff Holman, assistant secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, pointed out that the proportion of 'satisfactory' new teachers
correlated very closely with the proportion of all teachers judged to be
satisfactory.
He said: 'I think it's a very encouraging report. It shows that teachers who
had just come out of college were well prepared by their higher education
training for teaching.'
The National Union of Teachers attributed the high proportion of unsuitable
candidates joining the profession to the high level of unemployment.
The union said: 'The difficulty in getting a job now would persuade many
people to stay in the profes-sion, even if they are not suitable.'
It also said that poor resourcing, particularly in primary schools, made it
difficult for headteachers to monitor new teachers as adequately as they
wished.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Shake-up urged for civil justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL shake-up in the civil justice system to cut costs, reduce delays
and provide more user-friendly justice was called for yesterday by the Bar
and the Law Society.
Ms Hilary Heilbron QC, who chaired a joint working party of barristers and
solicitors, said civil justice was available only to the very rich or the
very poor.
Even for those who could afford to litigate, costs had escalated, delays had
increased and trials had become more complex and took longer, she said.
The working party calls for a re-organisation of the High Court. The Queen's
Bench Division and Chancery Division should be merged into one Civil
Division presided over by the lord chief justice - the Family Division
remaining a separate entity.
A number of specialist courts or case lists should be created. These would
include the commercial court, a company and insolvency list, a jury list, a
judicial review list, a patent court and a revenue list.
Judges would be allocated to these specialised case lists according to their
expertise.
The report calls for courts to exercise greater control over litigation.
Once proceedings have been started the court should remind parties to
litigate quickly or risk having the action struck out. Judges are urged to
take a more interventionist approach in cases to ensure parties focus on the
relevant issues.
More emphasis should be placed on alternatives to litigation, particularly
mediation.
The report has been sent to the lord chancellor for consideration. Ms
Heilbron said most of the recommendations could be implemented without the
need for primary legislation.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Management exercise cuts the council sick list: Reduced
absenteeism in London boroughs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of days council workers in London take off sick has fallen by a
third in the past year, following an investigation by the Audit Commission,
the public-sector efficiency watchdog.
A critical study by the commission, published in 1990, found sickness
absence averaged more than two-and-a-half times the national norm in the 10
London councils studied in detail. The cost was calculated at Pounds 25 for
each ratepayer.
The commission's follow-up report, published today, finds that local
authorities have succeeded in cutting days off from an annual average of
16.7 days per employee in 1990 to 11.5 days in 1991-92. The study says the
saving is the equivalent of Pounds 1.5m for each council.
Hammersmith and Fulham, and Camden councils have both halved sickness levels
 -in Camden's case releasing Pounds 2.4m of additional resources - while
Brent has generated more than Pounds 3m, the commission found.
The public sector in general has a poorer record on absenteeism than the
private sector and these differences are accentuated in London, a
Confederation of British Industry survey showed earlier this year.
Across all sectors, workers take an average of eight days off a year,
although there are large differences between blue-collar and white-collar
workers. The CBI found non-manual workers take five to six days, while
manual employees take an average of 10 days.
In spite of councils' relatively poor record, the sharp reductions achieved
over the past year by the London boroughs studied by the Audit Commission
are relevant to all organisations which are attempting to cut absenteeism.
Evidence that the subject is one of growing interest across sectors came
earlier this week, with the findings of a survey of personnel managers in
500 organisations conducted by Personnel Today magazine.
While just 9 per cent of companies had so far made cuts in sick-pay schemes,
nearly 20 per cent were considering doing so in the next year or two.
Cutting sick pay is a very direct, if crude, method of attempting to control
absenteeism or, at least, minimise its financial effects.
The Audit Commission sets out how the improvements in the London boroughs
have been achieved, within a framework of five principles identified as
essential to the successful cutting of absenteeism:
Commitment by senior management: Half the councils had set quantifiable
targets for overall absence levels. Clear responsibilities: Most of the
councils had started to make line managers more directly responsible for
controlling absence. Appropriate information: Almost all the councils had
introduced monthly or quarterly reporting of absence levels. Computerised
information systems played an important part, the Audit Commission found.
Suitably-trained managers: Most councils had introduced training for
supervisors and line managers in controlling absence and two had produced
handbooks on procedures.
Attention to staff welfare: Improvements in occupational health services
were considered by some of the councils to have been one of the factors that
had the greatest impact on reducing absenteeism.

FT  01 JUL 93 / TGWU seeks to broaden its appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TGWU general union is hoping to broaden its appeal by offering a range
of welfare and counselling services to members, former members, and even
non-members, Mr Bill Morris, the general secretary, said yesterday.
Prior to next week's union conference - which is held every two years - Mr
Morris said that the union needed a 'twin-track' strategy of improving
collective bargaining services for those in unionised workplaces while also
providing services such as legal support and debt counselling.
He speculated that such services might be advertised in local newspapers and
offered free to all-comers to improve the union's standing in the community.
'We want to provide a one-stop shop of services to actual and potential
members at our offices,' he said.
The union, which today loses its 70-year-old title of Britain's biggest
union to the Unison public-sector union conglomerate, has recovered
financially since Mr Morris took over two years ago. Last year the union had
a small surplus after a loss of Pounds 12m in 1991.
It is now planning to improve efficiency by spending about Pounds 1.2m on
updating its information technology systems and 'Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m' on
training staff over the next few years.
The union is still losing members but Mr Morris described de-recognition as
only a 'growing irritant' apart from sectors such as oil where it has become
a large problem.
Mr Morris has made some headway in reducing the faction fighting within the
union although he is still constrained by the power of a hard-left group on
the executive.
In spite of his attempt to emphasise the union's industrial role, Labour
party politics will hang over the conference. The union is expected firmly
to reject Mr John Smith's plans for reforming the links between unions and
the party although Mr Morris has been noticeably more conciliatory towards
the Labour leader than Mr John Edmonds, his opposite number at the GMB
general union.
The union is also expected to approve support for a change in the electoral
system and for entering formal merger talks with the GMB. The full merger is
expected to be complete within two to four years. The TGWU is also expected
to enter negotiations with the Ucatt building workers' union over a merger.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Board named for business school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER University has persuaded Sir Terence Burns, permanent secretary
to the Treasury, and Mr James Ross, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, to
help re-establish Manchester Business School's reputation after last year's
row over its future.
Both will serve on the school's new board, announced yesterday, with Mr Ross
as chairman. The board's predecessor body - a council of 14 business leaders
and former Whitehall mandarins - resigned 13 months ago after Professor Tom
Cannon, the school's director, left amid recriminations about the structure
of the school. The university dissolved the council.
The new board's first job will be to address a deficit at the previously
profitable school. Financial health partly depends on reputation, which in
Manchester's case ranks with Harvard in the US, Insead in France, and London
and Cranfield in the UK because of the quality of its postgraduate
management education.
Documents leaked to the Financial Times show a deficit of Pounds 326,700 at
the end of March - Pounds 706,700 worse than a then-budgeted surplus of
Pounds 380,000.
Professor Martin Harris, Manchester University's vice-chancellor, said
yesterday not all this could be attributed to the row - there was a general
downturn in demand for places on postgraduate courses because of the
recession.
Professor Tony Cockerell, acting director of the school, said cost-cutting
should have improved finances by the end of this term. The school is hoping
to be near break-even on the academic year.
Prof Cannon left after a long row over proposals to federate the business
school with the School of Management at the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology and the university's department of
accounting. The federation has still not been formed.
Also on the new business school board will be Mr Joe Dwek, chairman of
Bodycote International; Mr Robert Hough, chairman of Manchester Ship Canal;
Ms Kzimiera Kanto, finance director of Central Independent Television; Mr
Andrew Gardner, chairman of Boyden World Corporation; Mr Martin Bell,
finance director of Turner and Newall; Mr Tain Macdonald, chairman of SHL
Systemhouse Europe; and Mr Peter Dell, chairman of Ernst &amp; Young Recruitment
Network Practices.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Iraqi supergun 'could have fired tonne of anthrax'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSINESSMAN yesterday described how he helped MI6 track down components
for an Iraqi supergun capable of firing a tonne of anthrax at Israel's
capital.
Mr David James, chairman of Eagle Trust, said he had held meetings with the
intelligence service during the weeks leading up to the seizure by Customs,
in April 1990, of eight 1,000mm diameter tubes destined for Iraq.
Mr James dismissed suggestions that MI6 might have known before 1990 that
British companies were manufacturing supergun components and engaged in a
cover-up. He told the Scott inquiry that such claims would not be consistent
with the 'behaviour pattern' or 'enthusiasm to pursue everything' of the
individuals he dealt with.
The inquiry heard that MI6 had been involved in a Europe-wide effort to hunt
down supergun parts.
Mr James said the initial contact with MI6 took place at his instigation in
March 1990 after his suspicions had been aroused by three tubes, destined
for Iraq, which he had examined the previous January at Walter Somers, the
Eagle Trust subsidiary. He explained how an MI6 contact, referred to as Mr
Z, at once showed a keen interest in the tubes but seemed disappointed when
told of their dimensions.
MI6 explained that the details he had given were incompatible with the
dimensions of the 'monster' gun they were looking for with other European
intelligence agencies, but that the tubes might be part of a prototype for
this model, Mr James said.
MI6 said the larger gun would be capable of firing a tonne of anthrax a
distance of about 1,400 miles, bringing Tel Aviv within range of Baghdad.
Mr James said Mr Z had later given 'whoops of joy' when inquiries with
banking contacts had put him on the trail of the 1,000mm tubes for the
larger gun manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters.
He also revealed MI6 had provided special equipment which enabled about
1,000 pages of Walter Somers documents to be photographed covertly and
supplied to the intelligence agency.
Pressed on why he had not told MPs of his dialogue with MI6 when he was
interviewed in December 1991 by the Commons trade and industry committee, Mr
James said it was partly to protect his source and out of concern for his
safety.
In a separate session the inquiry heard that Lady Thatcher tended - when
prime minister - to take the side of those arguing for arms sales to go
ahead during inter-departmental wrangling over particular export deals.
Mr Robin Fellgett, a Treasury official, said Lady Thatcher would not
necessarily accept Treasury concerns about extending credit to a particular
arms buyer.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Banks attacked for curbs on poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS ARE denying poorer people and those in debt access to current
accounts, and should be legally regulated to ensure open access to their
services, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux said
yesterday.
In a strong attack on the way in which banks and building societies have
interpreted their code of practice since it was introduced in March last
year, the association said they were failing to observe both 'the spirit and
the detail'.
The association, which represents 1,300 bureaux providing advice on 250,000
cases of bank debt each year, argued that banks are now closing current
accounts held by debtors and refusing to open new ones for those on low
incomes.
In its submission to the committee headed by Sir George Blunden which is
reviewing the code, the association said the banks' behaviour was such that
a statutory code was now required to ensure open access to their services.
The association's criticisms are among the fiercest yet submitted to Sir
George's committee, which is considering changes to the code to be
introduced from March next year. Yesterday was the formal deadline for
submissions.
The association said it was finding an increasing number of cases of people
on low incomes or in debt having their current accounts closed by banks or
being turned down without explanation when they applied to open an account.
Ms Ann Abraham, the association's chief executive, said it was urging the
review committee to act to ensure that people were not refused accounts
without explanation, and were not put under undue pressure by banks
reclaiming debts.
The association said if a statutory code was not introduced, banks and
building societies should improve the monitoring and enforcement mechanisms
for the voluntary one.
Banks cannot avoid responsibility for losses suffered by their credit-card
customers in cases of breach of contract and misrepresentation by retailers,
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. He
did not accept the argument by some banks that they did not bear equal
responsibility with the retailer if they had no contract with the retailer
to process the card transaction.
Some banks have argued that if they are only responsible for issuing the
purchaser's card they are not liable because they have no contract with the
retailer. 'I do not agree with them,' Sir Bryan told an Institute of Trading
Standards conference.
The Chartered Institute of Bankers and the Chartered Building Societies
Institute merge today. Mr Brian Pearse, CIB president, said the new group
was better placed to maintain ethical standards.

FT  01 JUL 93 / BR rift on profits for InterCity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMBARRASSING rift opened between British Rail and its InterCity
subsidiary yesterday as the two published widely differing versions of how
much profit InterCity made last year.
British Rail announced that InterCity's operating profits had dropped from
Pounds 90.6m the previous year to Pounds 65.1m because of the effects of
recession.
However, InterCity simultaneously announced that a combination of vigorous
cost-cutting and innovative marketing had enabled it to push operating
profits up from Pounds 2m to Pounds 10.9m.
The discrepancy arose as British Rail published its annual results for the
year to March using new accounting standards that boosted the group's
profit-and-loss account by more than Pounds 100m.
Under the old accounting system the recession-stricken railway would have
reported pre-tax losses going up from Pounds 144.7m the previous year to
Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m - the group's worst financial performance since
1985.
Under the new system, intended to make BR's results conform more closely
with normal commercial practice, group pre-tax losses appear as Pounds
163.9m, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 24.6m the previous year. BR
used the new accounting system to calculate InterCity's operating profit.
But InterCity separately announced its results under the old accounting
system.
BR's board disowned InterCity's version of the results. Sir Bob Reid, BR
chairman, said it was pointless wasting time trying to calculate what
InterCity's results might have been had the accounting system not changed.
Mr Chris Green, InterCity's managing director, was on holiday. Before
leaving, he said the old accounting system gave a more accurate picture of
the underlying trends at InterCity.
Network SouthEast made operating profits of Pounds 5m, compared with a
restated loss of Pounds 19m; Regional Railways made Pounds 700,000 (restated
loss of Pounds 3.4m); Trainload Freight made Pounds 103.1m (restated profit
of Pounds 102.8m); and Railfreight Distribution lost Pounds 90.1m (restated
loss of Pounds 107.5m).
In addition, BR suffered a further fall in property profits, the Pounds 120m
cost of making 8,000 workers redundant and a higher interest charge because
of increased borrowings.
The Labour party and unions accused BR and the government of using
'accountant's sleight of hand' to make the results look better as the
railways approach privatisation. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour transport
spokesman, said changing the accounting system was an attempt by the
government to 'convince the money men that rail privatisation is an
attractive proposition. I doubt if they are going to buy it.'

FT  01 JUL 93 / CBI urges plan to cut deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER SPENDING on education and cuts in key areas of social security
spending were urged yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry. The
suggestions are part of a plan to help industry while cutting the Pounds
50bn government deficit.
The employers' body called for phased reductions in public spending over the
next three years, bringing the total in 1996-97 to Pounds 10bn less than the
government's target.
Spending on training, export support and transport infrastructure should be
protected, while outlays in areas such as child benefit and unemployment pay
should be aimed more at the needy, it says.
The ideas are part of a CBI plan to reduce the gap between government
spending and income from an expected 8 per cent of gross domestic product
this financial year to 3 per cent by 1996-97.
It says the Treasury does not go far enough in its projections, which
envisage the deficit being cut only to 4.5 per cent of GDP in three years.
The CBI also wants the government to freeze its pay bill next year. This
could be helped by shifting control of civil-service wages away from the
Treasury and towards individual government departments.
In this way, pay for key groups of public officials could be set according
to local factors such as productivity.
The CBI wants ministers to set up an agency to bring in private finance to
big capital investment projects and so reduce overall state spending.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said the ideas on containing
spending were 'not pie in the sky' but realistic. They were based partly on
what had been achieved in cost-control in the private sector during the
recession.
Mr Davies said he was 'disappointed' that Mr Kenneth Clarke had not been
tougher in his comments about cutting public spending. The CBI did not rule
out the need for tax rises taking effect from next April to add to those
already announced, although 'tax increases on companies would threaten the
investment and export-led growth that the UK economy needs'.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Shake-up urged for civil justice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL shake-up in the civil justice system to cut costs, reduce delays
and provide more user-friendly justice was called for yesterday by the Bar
and the Law Society.
Ms Hilary Heilbron QC, who chaired a joint working party of barristers and
solicitors, said civil justice was available only to the very rich or the
very poor. Even for those who could afford to litigate, costs had escalated,
delays had increased and trials had become more complex and took longer, she
said.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Eight years' jail for Nissan UK chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HUNT, the managing director of Nissan UK, the former West
Sussex-based car importers, was yesterday jailed for eight years at
Southwark Crown Court for his part in Britain's largest-ever tax fraud.
This followed his conviction last Saturday for conspiring to defraud the
Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax by helping artificially to
inflate freight charges for Nissan cars imported to the UK from Japan. When
interest is added, the total loss to the public purse from the fraud is
estimated to be more than Pounds 87m.
His co-defendant, Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director with the
company, was sentenced to three years after admitting, before the trial
began, to one offence of cheating the revenue.
Sentencing Mr Hunt, the trial judge, Mr Justice Gatehouse, said the offence
was 'in a category of its own'.
'You realise that this is an offence which is so serious that only a
custodial sentence is appropriate. An immediate custodial sentence which is
bound to be a long one,' he told Mr Hunt.
Sentencing Mr Shannon, the judge said his offence - helping to defraud the
Revenue of Pounds 17m over a one-year period between November 1985 and
October 1986 - was a less serious crime. He also gave him credit for his
guilty plea and for his co-operation with the Inland Revenue.
During the two-month trial the prosecution said the fraud was by far the
largest ever perpetrated on the Revenue. The 'prime mover' behind the fraud,
it alleged, was Mr Octav Botnar, the company's chairman who is in
Switzerland, beyond the reach of UK justice.
The Inland Revenue will now start civil proceedings to recover some of the
Pounds 87m from Mr Hunt. Mr Shannon has already reached a settlement with
the Revenue, having agreed to repay Pounds 10m. Both men were also barred
from being company directors.

HIGHER spending on education and cuts in key areas of social security

50bn government deficit.

In this way, pay for key groups of public officials could be set according
to local factors such as productivity.
As a way to bring in private finance to big capital investment projects and
so reduce overall state spending, the CBI wants ministers to set up a
special Whitehall agency to handle this area.
By showing a flexible approach, the agency could 'create the necessary
momentum' to tempt more companies to put up funds for schemes such as road
and rail links.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said the ideas on containing
spending were 'not pie in the sky' but realistic. They were based partly on
what had been achieved in cost-control in the private sector during the
recession.
Mr Davies said he was 'disappointed' that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new

next April to add to those already announced, although 'tax increases on
companies would threaten the investment and export-led growth that the UK
economy needs'.
The CBI wants the public sector to spend its money more intelligently, so
that departments make room for spending increases by switching resources
between different areas, rather than calling for more cash from the
Treasury.
It says departments should also be allowed to retain any savings in budgets
to spend in following years.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Chemical sector raises environment spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S chemical industry spent more than Pounds 1bn on the environment
last year, according to figures released by the industry's trade body. That
represents about 3 per cent of the industry's Pounds 29.9bn turnover.
The Chemical Industries Association said the UK chemical sector was the
first British sector to publish its spending and environmental emissions
figures. It was also the first national chemical industry to publish such
statistics, the association said.
Mr John Cox, director-general, said the statistics would form a model for
other industries to follow.
The association reported that between 1990 and 1992, environmental spending
increased from Pounds 830m to Pounds 1.032bn.
Capital expenditure on the environment rose from Pounds 184m to Pounds 305m.
As a proportion of total capital spending it rose from 8 per cent to 14 per
cent.
Environmental operating costs rose from Pounds 646m to Pounds 727m.
Discharges of 'red list' substances - a list of 23 groups of chemicals
defined by the government as being unwelcome in aqueous waste - fell 40 per
cent from 403 tonnes in 1990 to 243 tonnes in 1992.
The level of special wastes - a list of 29 classes of chemicals which
require particular attention - disposed of outside chemical sites fell 9 per
cent from 253,900 tonnes in 1990 to 231,800 tonnes last year.
However, these emissions actually increased from 213,700 tonnes in 1991. The
association said this was because companies had been closing down sites and
disposing of waste such as asbestos.
The industry's energy consumption fell 19 per cent between 1967 and 1990,
although production increased 112 per cent. Energy consumption per unit of
output fell 61.6 per cent.
Environmental indices created for the 114 sites between 1990 and 1992,
showed that 84 had improved their performance, while 30 had deteriorated.
Mr Jim Whiston, head of health, safety and environment at Imperial Chemical
Industries, said this showed the indices were credible measures of
performance.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, called for the
industry to publish a complete record of all toxic emissions.
'The industry is generally improving, but it has a long way to go,' said Mr
Whiston.
The figures were collated from about 256 locations, representing about 75
per cent of the association members' sites, 88 per cent of the capital
investment and 62 per cent of the entire industry's capital base.
The association said it expected more sites to join soon.

FT  01 JUL 93 / LWT staff seek share of windfall profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 500 staff at London Weekend Television have signed a petition
calling for a share of the Pounds 65m-plus in 'windfall profits' that could
go to the ITV company's management later this year.
The petition is being completed as Granada's purchase of about 15 per cent
of LWT has further pushed up its share price.
Under a management share scheme more than 40 LWT managers will be able to
convert each management share they hold into four ordinary shares. Last
month, at a share price of 385p, the managers were set to receive shares
worth Pounds 55m, creating 15 LWT millionaires, with Pounds 7m for chairman
Sir Christopher Bland and Pounds 5.3m for chief executive Mr Greg Dyke.
The Granada deal had by yesterday pushed the share price up to 466p. Sir
Christopher's shares are now likely to be worth about Pounds 8.5m and Mr
Dyke's about Pounds 6.4m.
The staff petition calls for a 'significant proportion of the windfall
profits' to be distributed to staff in the form of shares, and seeks the
reinstatement of this year's cut for staff in profit-related pay.
A staff committee will decide on Tuesday what to do with the petition amid
some suggestions from management that it will be easier to do something to
meet staff concerns if the petition is not formally submitted.
LWT staff have been angry at the contrast between the millions going to the
company's managers and the fact that staff received no specific reward for
helping to retain the London weekend franchise.

THE AMOUNT of equity withdrawn from housing last year fell to its lowest
level since 1981, the Housing Finance Review published by the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation, says.
In 1988 consumer demand was boosted by Pounds 21.6bn by withdrawal of equity
from private homes, with more than half the money raised through mortgages
not spent on housing. Last year the figure fell to Pounds 3.5bn.
The review estimates that 1.3m households were living in homes worth less
than their mortgages at the end of last year. The average level of negative
equity was Pounds 2,800.

CONFIDENCE about growth prospects in manufacturing has edged up in the past
month, a survey published today by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and

The survey of industry purchasing managers spending more than Pounds 250bn a

The purchasing managers' index, which shows sentiment in industry about an
upturn, was calculated at 53.7 last month, up from 53.0 in May, signalling
better growth prospects.
The survey indicates continuing upward pressure on prices as domestic and
export demand rises. The institute says, however that the trend to rising
prices of imported goods has eased as pressures from last year's devaluation
weaken.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government avoids EC seat defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night warded off defeat on the bill redrawing
constituencies for next June's elections to the European Parliament.
It agreed to public inquiries on proposed new boundaries if this proved
feasible, a concession which helped to persuade Labour not to oppose the
measure, clearing the way for its second Commons reading by 290 votes to 51,
a government majority of 239.
A Labour amendment criticising the government's failure to use the Boundary
Commissions or to provide an extra seat for Scotland was defeated by 300
votes to 254 - a government majority of 46.
In the preceding debate, government ministers replied in emollient tones to
opposition MPs and Tory Euro-sceptics who criticised its plans authorising
the creation of six new Euro-constituencies to raise the number of MEPs
representing the UK from 81 to 87.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said he would have preferred to appoint
the Boundary Commission in the normal way and to have public inquiries - but
there was no time.
He explained that two special European parliamentary constituency committees
would fulfil the role normally played by the boundary commissions, and hoped
they would include some of the members of the commissions.
Mr Howard looked to the committees to complete their work on boundaries for
five new Euro-constituencies in England and one in Wales by the end of
November.
His theme was later developed by Mr Peter Lloyd, the home office minister,
who said it was the government's 'objective' to set up the Commissions in
all but name - 'so far as is possible in the time'. Opposition parties would
be consulted on the make-up of the committees, he added.
The Maastricht bill last night cleared its committee stage discussion in the
Lords. The government had a majority of 129 to 63 as peers rejected an
opposition amendment in favour of the UK's adoption of the social chapter.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Political Notebook: Champagne and tears on the terrace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER mind Mr Michael Mates's relationship with Mr Asil Nadir, the row over
Tory party funding or whether Mr Kenneth Clarke really will raise income tax
in his November budget. There is a move afoot to bar political journalists
from the Commons terrace.
For those unfamiliar with the by-ways of the Palace of Westminster, it
should be explained that from Whitsun until the long summer recess the
terrace is the favourite refuge of our weary politicians.
Running alongside the Thames from Westminster Bridge, it offers a perfect
escape for MPs and ministers from the fetid atmosphere of their Commons
cubbyholes.
It is exclusive. Cooled by the gentle breeze off the river, it is a place to
drink Pimm's and champagne away from the angry gaze of a disgruntled
electorate.
What better way to fill the evening hours before that crucial 10pm vote on
the Fisheries (Hake and Haddock quotas) amendment order.
The terrace is a place also for serious gossipping and, in these febrile
times, for serious plotting. It is here that the Tory irreconcilables gather
in small knots to denigrate Mr John Major and to daydream about their
leader's downfall.
Their Labour counterparts forgo the Pimm's for the sharper bite of
Federation Ale. But the mutterings of the Tory Euro-sceptics are echoed by
dark whispers on the Labour left about Mr John Smith's fight with their
paymasters or Mr Tony Blair's drive to dump the party's ideological baggage.
Now some among our legislators have decided that the privileged access of
Westminster's political journalists to this exclusive sanctuary should be
withdrawn.
On one level this represents no more than one of the periodical spats
between the third and fourth estates which occur whenever politics gets
rough.
The journalists are emboldened to break the intricate rules of behaviour
which regulate co-habitation at Westminster. This or that minister is named
for socialising with Mr Major's enemies, this or that MP for preferring
another glass to attendance at a dreary committee meeting upstairs.
The politicians become terrified that stories (usually exaggerated) of
emptied champagne bottles will fuel still further the ire of their
constituents. They want the world to go away. It won't. So the next best
thing is to banish the journalists who report it.
In other circumstances such a dispute might be dismissed as so much hothouse
trivia. The two sides eventually will kiss and make up. Politicians and
journalists need each other.
But instead it has become an unhappy metaphor for Mr Major's government.
After the horrors of the past year it too wants the world to go away.
Ask a minister about the government's prospects and their thinking shifts
invariably to the autumn, skipping the traps in the intervening months.
By late September, the argument runs, the voters will have forgotten about
politics. The economic recovery will be gathering pace. Maastricht will have
been consigned to the history books. Mr Michael Mates and Mr Asil Nadir will
be little more than hazy memories. Mr Major will start again with a clean
slate.
It is this sort of thinking that has persuaded the party managers to postone
the Christchurch by-election to the end of this month at the earliest. If
the government is to suffer another disaster it will ensure at least that it
happens when as few people as possible are around to witness it. By the end
of July, the political commentators who would otherwise seize on a defeat to
again write off Mr Major's premiership should be ensconced in their Tuscan
villas.
But like the MPs on the terrace, Mr Major will find it is not that easy to
escape reality. It is not what the newspapers say that matters. If the
government loses Christchurch the Tory party will panic. Mr Major will face
a bloody party conference in the autumn. Unless he succeeds by then in
re-establishing a sense of purpose for his government his leadership will be
threatened.
There is one other thing - the matter of the Maastricht treaty. So far the
Euro-sceptics have failed in their efforts to mount an effective assault on
the treaty in the Lords.
But it is possible - just possible - that the sceptics will be driven to a
much more dangerous game in their efforts to overturn the treaty: that
enough Tory MPs will vote with the opposition to defeat Mr Major over the
social chapter in the Commons at the end of this month. What price then
champagne on the terrace?

</HEADLINE>

THE IRISH government yesterday halted progress towards the reform of
controversial procedures for the extradition of terrorist suspects to the
UK.
Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, stressed the hold-up was due to problems
uncovered during the final drafting of a bill aimed at closing loopholes in
the extradition legislation. He said the bill would now be tabled in the
autumn.

LIBERAL Democrat spokesman on the Citizen's Charter, Mr Matthew Taylor,
yesterday wrote to the chancellor demanding an explanation for the
'astonishing rise in unpaid tax' after his party claimed official figures
showed Pounds 1.7bn was written off by the Treasury last year.
Between 1991 and 1992 alone unpaid tax more than doubled - 'an increase of
Pounds 640m', Mr Taylor said.

LABOUR'S National Executive Committee yesterday agreed unanimously to repay
Pounds 11,000 donated by a Greek Cypriot businessman at the centre of a
fraud investigation.
The cash, donated by Mr Charilaos Costa, a clothing manufacturer, will be
immediately withdrawn from Labour's account and put aside while receivers
for Mr Costa's business are contacted.
The NEC also yesterday approved plans for all-women shortlists for the
selection of candidates in half the constituencies where the sitting Labour
MP is retiring or where there is a good chance of defeating another party.

MR Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, yesterday rejected suggestions that
his position was being compromised by large donations to the Tories from
wealthy Chinese citizens in the colony.
'Anybody who looks at the history of the last few months and believes that

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S INFLUENCE in the world will suffer unless it provides more forces
to match the increase in UN peacekeeping operations, the Commons defence
committee said yesterday, David White writes.
The committee, which has already attacked government plans for cutting army
staff levels, said it would expect the Ministry of Defence to show it had
sufficient forces to meet peacekeeping commitments.
It said the UK had lost an opportunity to make a valuable contribution in
Somalia by its unwillingness to send ground troops.
The committee recognised that the UK could not join every peacekeeping
operation but should participate only where its skills were needed.
The MPs warned that British forces could not continue indefinitely
supporting humanitarian aid in Bosnia while coming under direct attack.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, last night warned that the former Soviet
Union still poses a 'conceivable threat'. Defending Nato, he said it would
be 'foolish' to do away with collective defence.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: N-plant costings attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Public Accounts Committee yesterday accused the government of
complacency in estimating the cost of scrapping nuclear facilities.
Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour chairman of the House of Commons watchdog on
public spending, expressed fears that a heavy burden could fall on the
taxpayer if present government estimates of the costs proved to be wrong. He
said: 'I see a lot of assumptions made, not taking into account the very
serious consequences if you get it wrong.'
The committee is examining this month's National Audit Office report on
nuclear decommissioning, which put the total cost of scrapping nuclear power
stations and fuel plants, as well as some military facilities, at Pounds
17.9bn. Uncertainty over future nuclear liabilities disrupted the
electricity privatisation three years ago and nuclear facilities were left
in government hands.
Sir Peter Gregson, permanent secretary at the department of trade and
industry, said that the government currently believed that the costs of
decommissioning the facilities of the generators Nuclear Electric and
Scottish Nuclear would be covered by the companies' provisions. The
government has undertaken to pay for the eventual scrapping of the Atomic
Energy Authority's facilities, and some of those of British Nuclear Fuels.
However Mr Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, said that
the government's record of estimating decommissioning costs had been
'abysmal'.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mates's allegations on Polly case
rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, ANDREW JACK and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE emerged yesterday to contradict many of the allegations in Mr
Michael Mates's resignation speech concerning the conduct of the
investigations into Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
Mr Mates said in his speech: 'The SFO launched a highly publicised raid on
October 30 1990 on the headquarters of PPI . . after the company was in
administration . . beginning a process of trial by media.'
Journalists were present at the time of the raid on the company, as they
were during other SFO raids such as when Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell
were arrested. PPI was in administration at the time.
Since the time of Mr Nadir's arrest in December 1990 - and until he skipped
bail in May with little likelihood of returning - newspapers were in fact
constrained by potential contempt of court in what they said, for fear of
prejudicing his trial. 'The SFO did not go to northern Cyprus as requested
by Mr Nadir's defence lawyers, even though they visited the island to make
other criminal inquiries in the past.'
Foreign Office officials say the northern Cyprus authorities have adopted a
two-track policy for access of British police. There is full co-operation in
waiving the need for official paper on issues such as drugs and the return
of deported northern Cypriots to the island.
Whenever the Nadir case is raised, northern Cyprus insists that cooperation
must be conducted formally government-to-government which the Foreign Office
cannot allow because the UK does not recognise the state diplomatically.
The Metropolitan Police says that two officers mentioned by Mr Mates were on
the island for deportation duties unrelated to Mr Nadir. One senior police
officer yesterday conceded it may have been possible that one or two of the
officers may have asked about Mr Nadir in conversations with local people,
but they were doing so in personal capacity and did not form part of
official investigations.
'There is evidence of improper collusion between a senior officer of the
Inland Revenue and the SFO.'
Mr Michael Allcock, head of the Inland Revenue's special office 2, which
deals with high-profile and international tax investigations, was suspended
in September last year and is under police investigation. Mr Michael Jones,
his solicitor, yesterday stood by his earlier statement that his client was
'instrumental in the detection of Mr Nadir's affairs and the subsequent
referral thereof to the Serious Fraud Office.'
It is understood that Mr Allcock passed to the Stock Exchange some of the
information he came across during an investigation into Mr Nadir's tax
affairs. The Exchange and the Inland Revenue swap information on an informal
basis, according to officials. But the Inland Revenue said it is by law not
permitted to release details of taxpayers' affairs to third parties except
when ordered to by the courts.
Mr Jones does not deny that as part of his job Mr Allcock may have had some
contact with the SFO. He strongly rejects the suggestion that this could
amount to anything improper. He said nothing he had been told by the police
indicates that Mr Allcock's suspension had anything to do with the Nadir
case, although Mr Nadir's camp has accused Mr Allcock of being part of a
conspiracy against him. Mr Jones understands that his client was suspended
pending an investigation into allegations of corruption and bribery. He said
no criminal charges have yet been brought and Mr Allcock has not so far been
interviewed by police.
'Papers from documents taken by the SFO in the October 1990 raid were passed
to the administrators.'
Administrators to PPI at accountants Touche Ross confirmed that they did
receive some papers from the SFO after the raid at the time of
administration, but said they related to the company and they were therefore
entitled to receive them.
Court-ordered raids on Mr Nadir's property coordinated by Mr Neil Cooper,
his trustee in bankruptcy, took place earlier this year. These removed a
number of Mr Nadir's personal effects including his diaries. Mr Cooper says
he only took this action as a final resort because Mr Nadir refused to
cooperate.
'Improper influence has been exercised by the SFO when it claimed police
were investigating an alleged attempt to bribe the trial judge, Mr Justice
Tucker. The police had never declared their intention to do so.'
When the allegations were first made in the court, they were taken seriously
by both the SFO and the Metropolitan police investigating them. They were
later dismissed as an attempt to destabilise the trial.
'The SFO suggested a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by Mr
Nadir, Mr Anthony Scrivener, his defence counsel, Mr Wyn Jones, Metropolitan
Police assistant commissioner, and Mr Justice Tucker. This was unfounded.'
Since the hearing was in camera, it is unclear whether the allegations were
made by counsel to the SFO or the Department of Public Prosecutions. But the
suggestions were never taken seriously by anyone who was in the hearings.
'Whose agenda was being served by publication (of Mr Mates' letter to the
attorney-general)?'
Mr Mates says only Mr Nadir, the attorney-general and the SFO had copies.
The SFO claims its investigators did not have copies. Others suggest it may
be in Mr Nadir's interest to leak information which makes his chance of
obtaining a fair trial in the UK impossible.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Steady hands deliver a bucket of
cold water / Sizing up the attorney-general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE excitable scenes surrounding Tuesday's Commons attack on the
Serious Fraud Office by Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland
minister, it fell yesterday to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to
throw a bucket of cold water over the smouldering affair. He did not
disappoint.
Sir Nicholas, as attorney-general the government's senior legal adviser and
the man charged with policing the processes of prosecution outside Scotland,
is not one of Westminster's more charismatic characters.
Aged 54, he is the epitome of the cool top-drawer barrister who, it could
easily be forgotten, is also a politician. He has a dual role which has
increasingly prompted some lawyers to question whether it is any longer
appropriate to have someone elected on a party label who is also on hand to
provide key legal advice.
Regarded as a paid-up member of the 'safe pair of hands' club, he restored
an air of considered calm to yesterday's Commons proceedings, praising the
SFO for its record and pledging a system of prosecution conducted without
'fear or favour, affection or ill-will'.
Only once, in response to a jibe from Mr Dennis Skinner, did he raise his
voice, admonishing the Labour MP for Bolsover for asking 'idiotic
questions'.
Before entering parliament for super-safe Hemel Hempstead - now
Mid-Bedfordshire - in 1979, Sir Nicholas specialised in commercial and
industrial law and gained a reputation as a tenacious if somewhat
unglamourous advocate.
He became attorney-general after last year's general election. His previous
jobs were social security minister and solicitor-general.
Sir Nicholas has attracted his fair share of controversy. He came under
attack for his advice to ministers in the Matrix Churchill case that they
had no alternative but to ask the courts to prevent publication of official
documents where publication was against the public interest.
He was also criticised for his advice over the social opt-out clause of the
Maastricht bill and for his handling of the row over whether the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations apply to the
contracting-out of public services.
Sir Nicholas's standing among barristers remains high. Since entering
parliament he has been given credit by the Bar for having appeared in court
far more often than his predecessors.
One QC said: 'His main disadvantage is that he didn't gain much experience
at the Bar in the administrative and regulatory issues that he is now having
to deal with.'
Not everything has gone smoothly for Sir Nicholas away from Westminster. He
is one of a number of senior Conservative politicians who face huge losses
as a result of their membership of Lloyd's. Sir Nicholas became a Name in
1973 and last year was a member of 23 syndicates - including two which have
made big losses.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Every allegation was 'carefully
examined'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, yesterday agreed to publish
correspondence between him and Mr Michael Mates, former Northern Ireland
secretary, over the Asil Nadir case. But in a Commons statement he rejected
Mr Mates's call for an independent inquiry. He said a trial for Mr Nadir was
still fixed for October 4.
Sir Nicholas told MPs that it was 'perfectly proper' for an MP to make
representations to him 'about any anxieties they may have concerning the
conduct of a prosecution'.
Between September 1991 and May 10, 1993, Mr Mates made representations 'on a
number of occasions both in writing and orally on which occasions the
meetings were carefully noted by an official'. Each allegation and concern
raised by Mr Mates 'I caused to be carefully examined with the appropriate
authority or body and following which I wrote back to him in some detail.'
He told the Commons he was 'intensely conscious' of the need to keep
separate the roles of parliament and the political process, and that of the
judiciary, and it was only because of 'the exceptional circumstances' that
he had asked for the discretion of the speaker to enable him to deal with Mr
Mates's points.
He summarised the issues raised by Mr Mates, saying: 'He has accused the
Serious Fraud Office of improperly seeking to harass and prejudice the
defendant by allegedly tipping off the media as to the times and places of
arrests and other aspects of the investigation; of refusing to give proper
consideration to a report prepared by the accountants Binder Hamlyn for the
defence and failing to make proper inquiries in northern Cyprus; of
improperly opening privileged documents; of the allegedly improper seizure
by the trustee in bankruptcy of Asil Nadir's papers and certain personal
effects; and of improper pressures allegedly brought by the SFO on the
judge.'
Sir Nicholas said claims of improper press briefing had all been 'carefully
investigated' adding: 'None was accompanied by any tangible or verifiable
evidence' from Mr Mates. 'On the initial occasion involving the fall of the
Polly Peck share price the press were not even present until after that fall
and until the raid had been in progress for some considerable time.'
It was 'correct that two bags containing some privileged documents were
opened in error by police officers'. But they were not copied and were
returned after the issue of privilege had been determined by an independent
silk.
'The papers and effects seized by the trustee in bankruptcy were also seized
pursuant to an order of the court.'
Sir Nicholas went on: 'The report of Binder Hamlyn is part of the defence
case. The SFO has had no opportunity to scrutinise the supporting documents.
Assertions that their removal to this country would contravene local Cypriot
law have been refuted by independent Cypriot legal advice.
'The SFO has been unable to obtain permission for its officers to
investigate the case in northern Cyprus since each informal application had
been met by the response that approaches must be through diplomatic channels
which the House will appreciate do not exist in the absence of formal
recognition of Turkish republic of northern Cyprus.'
'The alleged conspiracy to bribe the judge is the subject of a separate
police investigation under the supervision not of the SFO but of the
director of public prosecutions. I do not propose to say more about it since
it has been dealt with in court either in camera or subject to reporting
restrictions.'
Apart from publicity surrounding the arrests, he said, all these matters
related essentially to the court proceedings.
'I am of the clear view that it is mistaken and wholly inimical to our
system of justice to set up a so-called independent inquiry into the
handling of such matters in parallel to a trial,' he said.
On the letters, Sir Nicholas said he had previously resisted publication.
'Inevitably they deal with a number of issues which have or may be raised in
the preparatory hearings or the trial which could therefore run the risk of
confusing the issues or from certain view points reflecting adversely on the
defendant.'

<TEXT>
content to let the attorney-general step into the spotlight to rebut the
allegations of impropriety made by Mr Michael Mates over the office's
handling of Mr Asil Nadir's case.
The brief denial of the allegations issued by Mr George Staple, the SFO
director, a few hours after Mr Mates's speech, remains its only official
comment on the furore.
The office said: 'All the criticisms have been answered - we don't want to
perpetuate this.'
However, the allegations have forced the office on to the defensive. A few
days prior to Mr Mates's statement, senior police investigators were ordered
by the office to shut out all contacts with the press - whether overt or
covert.
Both the police involved and the office have become nervous at the way the
whole controversy has developed. 'This is a political issue that we just
don't want to get drawn into,' said one investigator.
Senior investigators insist there is no conspiracy other than Mr Nadir's own
efforts to undermine their attempts to bring him to justice.
A view widely held among those at the office and others probing the affairs
of Polly Peck is that the campaigning by Mr Nadir and others such as Mr
Mates is serving to diminish any prospect that the fugitive tycoon could
have a fair trial in Britain, should he ever be brought back before the
courts here.
One senior investigator said yesterday: 'Mr Mates had been misled . . . What
his allegations are succeeding in doing is putting a smokescreen around Mr
Nadir.'
The allegations have come at a sensitive time for the SFO, with the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice due to report next week.

LABOUR yesterday approved plans for all-women shortlists for the selection
of candidates in half the constituencies where the sitting Labour MP is
retiring or where there is a good chance of defeating another party.
The decision by the National Executive Committee is part of Labour's
attempts to increase the number of women in parliament.
However Labour MPs last week threw out a proposal that they should vote for
at least four women in shadow cabinet elections, compared to the current
three.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Irish reform of extradition halted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government yesterday halted progress towards the reform of
controversial procedures for the extradition of terrorist suspects to the
UK.
Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, stressed the move was temporary. He said
the hold-up was due to problems that had been uncovered by officials in the
Irish attorney-general's department during the final drafting of a bill
aimed at closing loop-holes in the extradition legislation.
It was emphasised by government sources that the difficulties were legal
rather than political, and would lead only to a delay in ratifying the
changes, which centre mainly on the classification of terrorist firearms
crimes considered to be extraditable. Mr Reynolds said the reform bill would
now be tabled in the autumn.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard seeks to calm EC seat row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard, home secretary, last night sought to head off a revolt by
Tory MPs against the bill authorising the creation of six new
Euro-constituencies and increasing the number of MEPs representing the UK
from 81 to 87.
He replied in emollient tones to a series of interruptions from
Euro-sceptics on the Conservative backbenches who, after embarrasing the
government through delaying the passage of the Maastricht bill, turned their
fire on the European parliament.
Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend East), one of the most outspoken critics of the
European Community, stressed that if the bill were to be defeated all the
member states would be prevented from increasing their representation in the
European parliament.
Mr Howard acknowledged that the tactics employed by the Euro-sceptics
against the Maastricht bill meant that there would be insufficient time for
the proposed boundaries for the new Euro-constituencies to be subjected to
public inquiries.
He explained that two special European parliamentary constituency committees
would fulfil the role normally played by the parliamentary boundary
commissions, and that he hoped they would include some of the members of the
commissions.
Mr Howard looked to the committees to complete their work on boundaries for
five new Euro-constituencies in England and one in Wales by the end of
November.
With the next elections for the European parliament due to take place in
June 1994 there would not be time to hold public inquiries, but written
representations would be considered before MPs were asked to approve the
boundaries of the six new constituencies, he said.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, challenged the decision not to
allocate a new constituency to Scotland.
He also maintained that it would be possible, in spite of time constraints,
for the proposed boundaries for the new constituencies to be subject to
public inquiries.

<TEXT>
THE US today will spin off its uranium enrichment activities from the
Department of Energy to an independent corporation, which the administration
hopes to prepare for privatisation in two years.
The US Enrichment Corporation will run two uranium plants - at Paducah,
Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio - and will have annual sales of about Dollars
1.5bn.
Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, said the new company's mandate would be
to regain for the US what used to be a dominant share of the world
enrichment market, by changing from a bureaucracy to a business.
The US, which now charges 30-40 per cent more than competitors such as
Europe's Eurodif and Urenco consortia, has seen its world monopoly of
enrichment services slip to 46 per cent,
One of USEC's tasks will be the reprocessing of weapons-grade, highly
enriched uranium from the former Soviet Union into low-enriched uranium for
use in commercial power generation.

FT  01 JUL 93 / TV networks to warn on violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE four US television networks, under congressional pressure to shield
children from shows displaying violence, yesterday agreed to air warnings to
parents just before the start of such programmes.
The agreement - unveiled by senior officials of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -
comes amid growing concern in Congress about the possible harmful effects of
television violence on viewers, particularly children.
Congress members had warned the networks that they might seek legislation to
impose a rating system on programmes, similar to that applied to cinema
films.
In an attempt to head off such a system, the networks say that they will
decide which programmes merit a parental warning, based on the degree and
the context of violence shown.
This independent initiative will come into effect in the autumn, the warning
being shown before the start of shows and being available for publication in
programme guides.
However, the system does not yet cover the cable television networks, which
account for a large and growing slice of Americans' viewing, nor does it
extend to cartoons.
Mr Howard Stringer, president of CBS, acknowledged that the networks were
likely to lose some advertising business from shows carrying violence
warnings. Mr Reed Hundt, a Washington lawyer known mainly for work in
anti-trust litigation, has been nominated by the Clinton administration to
head the Federal Communications Commission, the government body which
oversees telecommunications and media.
Mr Hundt, 45, would succeed Mr Alfred Sikes, a Republican who resigned in
January when Mr Clinton took office.
The new nominee is a close associate of Vice-President Al Gore, who is
playing a leading role in communications policy.

FT  01 JUL 93 / US likely to extend N-test moratorium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is expected to extend the US moratorium on nuclear
testing, bowing to intense opposition from Congress to any further such
tests.
The extension would also halt any British tests at the US testing site in
Nevada and please the Russian government, which wants neither to incur the
cost of further tests of its own nor to encourage any nuclear ambitions
among its neighbours, especially Ukraine.
Mr Clinton said yesterday that he had made a decision but was still working
on details. He would make a statement in the next few days.
Congress last year passed a nine-month moratorium on nuclear testing that
expires today, but it allows up to 15 tests over the next three years.
After an intense debate within the administration, a proposal was submitted
to the president 10 days ago for six US and three British tests over the
1993-96 period.
Consultations with members of Congress showed, however, that there was no
likelihood that the House of Representatives would accept a resumption of
testing, and little support for further tests even in the Senate.
Particularly damaging to the case for renewed testing was the Defence
Department's refusal to commit itself to fitting its nuclear missiles with
any safety features developed because of the tests.
Nuclear weapons laboratories have argued that more tests are needed to
improve nuclear weapons' safety and reliability.
Mr Clinton is expected to announce a 12-month extension to the moratorium,
leaving the possibility of resuming tests in 1995, before the 1996 target
date which Congress and the president have set for negotiating a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
Unless other nuclear powers conduct their own tests before then, a
resumption appears unlikely, especially as new US tests in 1995 could
undercut efforts to win support from other nations for the renewal of the
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which is due to expire that year.
The British government, which had hoped for more tests to help it develop a
new warhead for the Trident missile, has little choice but to go along with
a US moratorium.
The country most embarrassed by an extension of the test ban is likely to be
France, which started the moratorium by announcing that it was suspending
its own controversial tests at Mururoa in the South Pacific, but which is
keen to conduct more tests to help it modernise its nuclear arsenal.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Mexico acts on wrong arm of the law: Anti-corruption drive
in law enforcement agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and LUCY CONGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOADED by the murder in May of a Roman Catholic cardinal, the Mexican
government has recently launched a high-profile clampdown on corruption in
the police force and the attorney-general's office.
In two months, Mr Jorge Carpizo, the respected attorney-general, has
arrested or dismissed scores of high-ranking police officers, set up an
elite anti-drug police unit, and thrown in jail leaders of the notorious
Sinaloa drug cartel.
This came after President Carlos Salinas had vowed the killers of Cardinal
Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo would be caught and punished.
The government's moves against corruption are at least partly aimed at
satisfying outraged domestic and international opinion. The murder of the
cardinal, by presumed drug traffickers, sparked a fury unmatched by any
other act of violence in Mexico's recent history, and threatened to damage
the president's domestic standing.
In the US, Mexico's attempts to project itself as a modernising, progressive
country took a battering. Stories of shoot-outs in the country's second
largest airport, and tunnels dug for drug traffickers between the US and
Mexico, dominated coverage of the country, and fuelled concerns over the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
But, while the anti-corruption measures have helped the government regain
the initiative after Cardinal Posadas was murdered, their effectiveness has
been widely questioned. Corruption is so much a part of Mexico's police
force - from everyday bribes by motorists to protection money from drug
gangs - that until now all reforms aimed at weeding it out have failed.
The previous attorney-general, Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga, now ambassador in
Paris, was once hailed as a moderniser, and he too replaced corrupt
officials with what was meant to be a new breed of clean lawyers. Now many
of these officials, such as Mr Rodrigo Esparza, former chief of federal
police in the west coast state of Sinaloa, have been fired after suspected
involvement with drugs.
The centrepiece of the latest initiatives against drug trafficking is the
creation of the National Institute to Combat Drugs as an autonomous agency.
Modelled on the US Drug Enforcement Agency, the institute will lead
investigations of the drug trade, arms trafficking and money laundering,
create an intelligence system and run operations to intercept drug
traffickers and shipments.
The Salinas initiative requires an overhaul of the federal anti-narcotics
squad, notorious for corruption. The institute's charter calls for splitting
the anti-narcotics police from the attorney general's federal judicial
police.
The administration has also arrested 35 people in connection with the
shooting of Cardinal Posadas and six others. Mr Joaqun Guzman Loera,
apparently the intended target of the attack and head of the powerful
Sinaloa drug cartel, was seized in Guatemala on June 9, and brought to
Mexico.
Later, the Mexico City police chief was arrested for his role several years
ago in freeing Mr Guzman Loera after the capital's police had captured him.
The attorney-general's office (PGR) also announced the dismissal of 67
federal judicial policemen on suspicion of drug-related corruption, while at
least three judges in Sonora state are under investigation for allowing the
release of suspected drug traffickers
Despite these dramatic steps, many are sceptical that they will be
sufficient to thwart drug traffickers and their ability to corrupt those who
stand in their way.
Mr Robert Bonner, head of the DEA in the US, warmly applauds Mexico's tough
measures, but says a thorough clean-up would require 'taking on officials
who aid and abet drug trafficking'.
'The question is,' Mr Bonner says, 'how do you professionalise the PGR, how
do you develop a justice system that does not let people pay their way out,
and others who are arrested go free? . . . You cannot just remove the (drug)
leaders. We know there are relatives and others who will replace them - you
have to got to remove totally the infrastructure of the organisation.'
Mr Bonner suggests some institutional changes that might cut the incentive
to take bribes. One reform would eliminate the practice of senior police
jobs being auctioned off to the highest bidder, and another an end to the
custom of a madrina, a freelance agent who works alongside policemen, being
paid a commission of goods confiscated in police operations.
Such reforms may be in the making, and would be popular with most Mexicans,
fed up with bribing police and being victimised by gangs who enjoy police
protection. But they would also end a lucrative source of income for
government and police officials, whose basic salary is low and expectations
of wealth high.

SOUTH AFRICA'S multi-party democracy negotiators last night overcame another
hurdle on the path to a new constitution, after they agreed that an elected
constituent assembly should write the final post-apartheid constitution.
The agreement came after the Inkatha Freedom Party had dropped its
insistence that the 26-party forum of appointed representatives, which has
been sitting since April, write a final constitution.
Instead, the 26-party forum will write an interim constitution - which could
remain in force for several years - and set out binding principles by which
a final constitution will be written by the elected body.
These principles, with the force of law, will include substantial devolution
of power to regions, a key demand of Inkatha and other parties from black
homelands.
Inkatha had feared that an elected constituent assembly, in which it is
likely to have a limited role, would ignore its demand for strong regional
government. But its fears were assuaged when the multi-party forum promised
to agree regional powers ahead of the assembly.
However, although Inkatha and its allies agreed to the process by which a
constitution should be written, they reserved the right to reject the
interim constitution to be eventually written.
Regions would have their own constitutions and legislatures, like US states.
An official of the African National Congress yesterday called for the
imposition of a heavy 'reconstruction levy', on individuals and corporations
in South Africa, to finance the building of a 'new and more equal'
post-apartheid society.
Writing in the Johannesburg Star newspaper, Mr Tito Mboweni, deputy head of
the ANC economics department and a chief economic policy-maker, urged that
the levy be on the lines of Germany's post-war levy, whereby individuals and
corporations paid half their assets to the state to help finance
reconstruction.

INDONESIA'S western donors yesterday increased their aid for the coming year
to Dollars 5.1bn (Pounds 3.4bn), from Dollars 4.9bn, in recognition of its
'excellent' economic performance and development needs.
But several members of the 18-nation consultative group, chaired by the
World Bank since Indonesia's row with the Netherlands over human rights,
raised the issue of 'good governance', which they said was vital to sustain
the country's development. Canada and Belgium were among those said to have
taken this line.
Mr Gautam Kaji, the World Bank's vice-president for East Asia and the
Pacific who chaired the three-day meeting in Paris, acknowledged some donors
brought up the issue of human rights, but said they were pursuing this
bilaterally.
Dr Saleh Afiff, Indonesia's economy minister, had declined to comment on the
concerns in a multilateral forum as, he said, they were being discussed
bilaterally.
In a statement, the donors' group congratulated Jakarta 'on the continuity
of its sound macroeconomic management and the country's excellent economic
performance'. In 1992-93 this had resulted in the non-oil sector expanding
7.5 per cent, with a 30 per cent growth in exports.
The current account deficit fell to 2.4 per cent of GDP. The Dollars 1.4bn
improvement reflected a growth in non-oil exports and a larger than expected
decline in imports.
Indonesia was again congratulated for cutting poverty from 60 per cent of
the population in 1970 to 15 per cent.

FT  01 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Russia urges 'trade not aid' treatment -
Moscow's call to be regarded as normal - with help from friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin and his government are demanding an end to trade
'discrimination' against Russia as it struggles to switch to a market
economy and Mr Yeltsin intends to make the point when he meets leaders of
the Group of Seven industrial countries at their Tokyo summit next week.
'We want Russia really to become an equal member of the world financial and
trading community,' says Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister
responsible for Russia's foreign economic relations.
In the past few weeks, Russia has demanded rapid admission to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and refused to sign a partnership agreement
with the European Community on the grounds that it provides insufficient
access for Russian goods and services to EC markets.
Last week, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, called off a
visit to the US in protest against sanctions imposed by Washington because
of a Dollars 350m Russian contract to supply rocket engines to India.
According to Washington, the deal violates international agreements to limit
the proliferation of missile technology which India says it needs for a
peaceful space programme. Russia says the US simply wanted its companies to
get the deal.
Closer to home, Russia is demanding that western loans be given to other
newly-independent former Soviet republics to pay for Russian energy
supplies. The beauty of this scheme, which the west does not even want to
discuss until the Tokyo summit is out of the way, is that Russia would get
new western funds while the other republics would get new debt.
'The fact that Russia is negotiating aggressively on trade shows that it's
becoming a normal country,' said one western diplomat. 'The controversy
arises from the fact that it expects better than average treatment as part
of western support for reforms.'
Some of the Russian complaints about discrimination are a negotiating tactic
since even Russian officials acknowledge that they do not want to expose the
country to foreign trading competition all in one go - which is what speedy
admission to Gatt, for instance, would imply.
But public posturing notwithstanding, Russia's demand for 'trade not aid'
threatens vital western interests in a way which earlier forms of assistance
have not.
The conflict is particularly acute for the EC, Russia's close neighbour and
biggest trading partner, which needs to reconcile the desire to help Russia
with pressure to protect EC jobs and companies from competition from the
east.
Access to western markets happens to be one of the most effective forms of
support the west can give Russian market reforms. It enables Russian
enterprises to help themselves rather than demand subsidies from the
government. It avoids the risk of Russia's inefficient state bureaucracy
squandering direct grants from western governments. It also makes western
demands for faster market reforms in Russia more credible.
'Jeffrey Sachs (the Harvard professor turned Russian economic adviser) is
telling the Russians to restructure or close down their factories. I say we
should close ours,' said one western diplomat.
However, controlled domestic energy prices, the fact that many Russian
enterprises have only a poor idea of what their costs are and the desire of
many to make precious hard currency by pricing their exports cheaply, are
all presented by western competitors as arguments for maintaining
restrictions on imports from Russia.
Exports of natural gas and oil needed by western Europe account for the fact
that Russia has a trade surplus with the EC. But while there is no demand
for most Russian industrial goods, the few which are in demand face
restricted access on the grounds that Russia is not yet a market economy.
The EC operates quantitative restrictions on steel and textiles, and in
effect limits imports of enriched uranium by requiring a licence for each
deal. It is soon to decide whether to slap anti-dumping duties on Russian
aluminium imports, which last year sharply drove down western aluminium
prices and hurt western producers.
But with much of the EC steel industry already in the throes of painful
restructuring, and no similar changes yet in evidence in Russia, even free
traders within the European Commission, who are sympathetic to Russia's
case, say it must make more progress with market reforms to obtain better
access. In that spirit, Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner responsible for
foreign economic relations, says a review clause contained in the
co-operation and partnership deal could transform it into a free trade
agreement in three years.
Trade could certainly be useful as an incentive for Russia to speed up
domestic reforms. In a move which should help strengthen Russian
manufacturers' case in the face of accusations that they benefit from unfair
energy subsidies, the government plans to free coal prices from today and
domestic oil and gas prices by the end of the year.
Russia is also putting the finishing touches to a market-sharing compromise
with the US and the EC which could show the way in other sectors and will
give it the right to conduct 12 commercial satellite launches between 1995
and 2000. This is despite fears at western Europe's Arianespace that it
could be wiped out by Russia's ability to conduct launches at half its cost.

FT  01 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Nafta delay latest blow to Clinton trade
policy - The entire US effort to bring free trade to the Americas has been
thrown into question
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ORDER by a US federal court judge yesterday to delay the North American
Free Trade Agreement for an environmental impact assessment was the latest
blow to a carefully constructed Clinton trade policy, which now seems in
danger of crumbling.
The US scenario for the economic summit next week in Tokyo had President
Bill Clinton appearing with a budget reduction package in hand, along with
Senate and House approval for a renewed fast-track negotiating authority,
giving the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations a last lease of life
until December 15.
The president and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, had also
agreed to produce by next week a negotiating framework to set up the
perimeters of the US-Japanese bilateral trade relationship.
The Japanese political crisis dealt the first setback. Then, last week in
Tokyo, a ministerial meeting - to prepare for a tariff reduction deal by the
US, EC, Canada and Japan - stalled. Talks on a bilateral framework got
nowhere.
Into the increasingly gloomy picture, on Tuesday, came statements by Mr
Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, who provocatively tied a global
trade deal to the US lifting anti-dumping duties on steel. These brought an
outraged reaction from Mr Peter Watson, chairman of the US International
Trade Commission, who demanded an apology.
'The US administrative and quasi-judicial regime affords a significantly
higher degree of due process to foreign respondents than provided by France
through the related EC process,' he said.
The delay of Nafta for an environmental impact statement throws into
question the US administration's entire effort to bring free trade to the
Americas. And according to one prominent Washington trade lawyer, the court
ruling may also apply to a Uruguay Round agreement: 'You can't possibly do
an environmental impact assessment on the whole world economy.'
Even an expedited appeal would take at least two months. The administration
could ignore the judge's order and risk being sued for contempt, but it is
still trying to prove its green credentials.
Mr Clinton's choice of a novice in trade - Mr Mickey Kantor - as his trade
representative has caused concern among US trading partners (particularly
when Mr Kantor trips on EC sensibilities as he did by doing a separate
telecoms deal with Germany).
Still hoping for progress in Tokyo, Mr Kantor yesterday delayed sanctions
against Japan for its closed procurement market in construction. Next week
he will have to prove his mettle, not just against other more experienced
negotiators, but also against the whims of leaders who for six years have
not demonstrated the political courage to agree on trade liberalisation.

FT  01 JUL 93 / S Africa reconstruction levy sought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN OFFICIAL of the African National Congress yesterday called for the
imposition of a heavy 'reconstruction levy' on individuals and corporations
in South Africa to finance the building of a 'new and more equal'
post-apartheid society.
Writing in the Johannesburg Star newspaper, Mr Tito Mboweni, deputy head of
the ANC economics department and one of its chief economic policy-makers,
argued for a charge to be levied along the lines of Germany's post-war levy,
under which individuals and corporations paid half of their assets to the
state to help finance reconstruction.
Such a levy is not official ANC policy, but Mr Mboweni's advocacy suggests
that the organisation is seriously considering adopting it officially. Mr
Mboweni made clear the levy would be compulsory: 'All South Africans who
have the ability to contribute financially to the process of reconstruction
should do so by law.' He added that normal budgetary resources were
insufficient to finance post-apartheid development expenditure without
creating unsustainable budget deficits.
Mr Mboweni sought to reassure South Africans that 'there is no need for
anybody to be scared' at the idea of a levy. However, his comments could
well give cause for concern to the potential investors now being courted in
the US by Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader. He is touring the US to raise
election campaign funds for the ANC, and woo US investors.

FT  01 JUL 93 / China moves to cool economic expansion

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is poised to clamp down on its overheating economy amid reports that
its central bank governor has been sacked for failing to impose order on a
chaotic financial sector.
Wen Wei Po, a Beijing-affiliated newspaper in Hong Kong, reported yesterday
that Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier, would have his responsibilities
extended to include supervision of the People's Bank. His main task would be
to enforce tougher credit curbs.
Officials in Beijing have declined to confirm the sacking of Mr Li Guixian,
the central bank governor, but there seems little doubt he is being made a
scapegoat for an explosion of credit that has fuelled unrestrained economic
growth.
China's ruling politburo is reported to have convened recently in emergency
session to formulate stronger steps to deal with the economic crisis, marked
by spiralling inflation and concern over disorder in the financial system.
Cost of living increases are reported to have reached 20 per cent on an
annualised basis in the first five months of the year in the larger cities.
Among criticisms of Mr Li are that he failed to control non-bank financial
institutions, such as trust companies, that have lent huge sums for
investment in property and industrial development zones. This has helped
fuel a capital spending binge that is one of the main causes of China's
economic overheating.
The State Planning Commission reported last week that the economy would grow
at 13-14 per cent in the first six months. This far exceeds the 8-9 per cent
growth targets for the year, announced in March at the National People's
Congress, or parliament.
Measures to cool the economy, including credit curbs, appear to have been
ineffective. A panicky leadership has clearly decided that more severe
medicine is required.
The reported decision to invest Mr Zhu, 65, with greater responsibility for
disciplining the economy is a sign of the situation's seriousness. It is
also confirmation of Mr Zhu's growing importance; although he can hardly
afford to fail in this tough assignment.
Reports of an imminent reshuffle of China's economic team coincides with a
meeting in Beijing of the standing committee of the country's parliament, at
which harsh criticism has been voiced of the leadership's financial
management.
Mr Cai Cheng, a prominent member of the standing committee, was quoted by
Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, as saying poor financial management and
weak controls on banks were two of the main reasons for the country's
present financial problems.
Mr Cai singled out what he described as a failure to reform China's
financial system as a principal cause of the present malaise. 'The financial
system has not been reformed to suit the market economy,' he said.
Vice-premier Zhu Rongji, described as China's economic czar, is regarded as
a reformist but has been advocating more decisive steps to regain control of
the economy.
However, divisions in the leadership, the poor health of premier Li Peng,
who is suffering from a heart condition, and fears of the reform process
being derailed have delayed decisions.
A senior Chinese official has attempted to scotch the latest round of
speculation that Beijing may soon scrap its special foreign exchange
certificates (FEC) in a one-off bid to unify exchange rates, Reuter adds
from Shanghai.
Mr Yang Xianlin, head of the policy department at the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange Control, said he had 'received no notification that
exchange into FEC will cease', an official newspaper reported yesterday.
'The rumours that the FEC will be abolished are without foundation,' he was
quoted as saying.
Mr Yang's statement reflects sharpening concern over the future of the FEC,
which China introduced in the early 1980s as a special currency for
foreigners parallel to its own renminbi yuan.
Repeated rumours that the FEC is about to go have swept the country's
markets.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Japan rebels admit to higher earnings
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE rebels who brought down Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party are
either more honest or better investors than than their political peers. They
admitted yesterday to earning almost 50 per cent more than the party average
last year when Japanese MPs disclosed their incomes for the first time.
The 44 pro-reform rebels, who formed the Japan Renewal Party, are apparently
better cushioned for the tough limits on political donations that would be
part of their reform package.
The JRP members admitted to earning an average Y50.4m (Dollars 471,000) last
year, well above the all party average of Y30.9m and the Y34.8m of their
former LDP colleagues. Japanese politicians receive an annual allowance of
Y20.6m, and the extra money comes from interest, dividends, corporate
retainers or asset sales.
But the figures announced yesterday do not include funds that publicity-shy
politicians have channelled through private companies, relatives or even
their young children.
There are at least 81 Japanese politicians who have confessed to being poor
managers of their funds - they claim that the only income received last year
was the Y20.6m in parliamentary pay, and not a yen more in dividends,
interest received or appearance fees.
The figures prompted JRP members to explain that the difference in their
earnings was a measure of their honesty, but the large gap was an
embarrassment. Japan Communist party members were at the bottom of the pile,
claiming that their average income was Y21.4m, while the socialist party
members were better heeled at Y24.1m
Members of most parties were still nervous yesterday that Japanese
prosecutors would strike again before a general election on July 18, and
were also concerned that the construction industry has been frightened away
from political donations. The prosecutors arrested a well-known regional
mayor on Tuesday for allegedly taking bribes from construction companies.
Prosecutors said executives from four leading construction companies
admitted to giving Y100m to the mayor, Mr Toru Ishii, but denied that the
money was a bribe. Among the officials in custody is a vice-president from
Shimizu, the largest general contractor, whose president, Mr Harusuke
Imamura, resigned yesterday from a post at the Keidanren, the federation of
economic organisations.
Mr Imamura had been chairman of a committee on decentralisation, and
apparently tendered his resignation as a mark of shame at his company's
implication in the scandal. The Keidanren, the country's most important
business organisation, immediately accepted the resignation.
The construction ministry said the four companies, Hazama, Nishimatsu
Construction, Mitsui Construction, and Shimizu, will be forbidden from
tendering for ministry-controlled contracts for between two and four months,
while 20 local governments have also imposed bans on the companies.
Prosecutors say the four companies provided funds to Mayor Ishii in an
attempt to break into the public works market in northern Japan.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Western donors to increase aid for Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S western donors yesterday increased their aid for the coming year
to Dollars 5.1bn, (Pounds 3.4bn) from Dollars 4.9bn, in recognition of its
'excellent' economic performance and development needs.
But several members of the 18-nation consultative group, chaired by the
World Bank since Indonesia's row with the Netherlands over human rights,
raised the issue of 'good governance', which they said was vital to sustain
the country's development. Canada and Belgium were among those said to have
taken this line.
Mr Gautam Kaji, the World Bank's vice-president for East Asia and the
Pacific who chaired the three-day meeting in Paris, acknowledged some donors
brought up the issue of human rights, but said they were pursuing this
bilaterally.
Dr Saleh Afiff, Indonesia's economy minister, had declined to comment on the
concerns in a multilateral forum as, he said, they were being discussed
bilaterally.
In a statement, the donors' group congratulated Jakarta 'on the continuity
of its sound macroeconomic management and the country's excellent economic
performance'. In 1992-93 this had resulted in the non-oil sector expanding
7.5 per cent, with a 30 per cent growth in exports.
At the same time the current account deficit fell to 2.4 per cent of gross
domestic product. The Dollars 1.4bn improvement reflected a growth in
non-oil exports and a larger than expected decline in imports.
Indonesia was again congratulated for reducing poverty from 60 per cent of
the population in 1970 to 15 per cent.
But it was warned it faced growing competition, particularly from
newly-liberalised economies among its Asian neighbours, in expanding and
diversifying exports and attracting foreign investment.
The donors' group took note of the government's recent de-regulation in
cutting tariffs and non-tariffs, and agreed Indonesia needed to reduce
further its bureaucratic obstacles.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Saddam resists sanctions and missiles: The hardships faced
by ordinary Iraqis under a resilient regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Iraqis wait outside the Rasheed shopping centre in Baghdad to
collect their monthly survival packs of government rations. They talk in the
lines of the recent US air attacks on the country, the latest news from
friends and family who have moved abroad, and the success so far of Iraq's
football team in the qualifying rounds of the World Cup.
Many of them like to consider themselves part of Baghdad's well-to-do middle
class. But the 200-300 dinar monthly salaries of many of them, the
equivalent of between Dollars 66 and Dollars 100 before the Gulf war of
1991, now barely reach double figures in dollar terms.
The US missile attack on Baghdad at the weekend came as a blow to these
people who had hoped that the election of President Bill Clinton in the US
might lead to a less belligerent relationship and some easing of UN
sanctions. Instead, the economic pressure seems certain to continue with US
policy aimed at pushing Iraqis to overthrow President Saddam Hussein.
The rationing system has become a means of survival for most of Iraq's 18m
people. Its food basket consists of wheat, rice, sugar, oil and tea but it
provides only 68 per cent of the minimum daily energy requirement. Many
families have to seek other sources of income.
Aid agencies in Baghdad claim that malnutrition is becoming a real problem
among the poor and vulnerable, especially in the north and south of the
country.
With little means of earning hard currency, and a limited and inefficient
agriculture sector, the government is forced to play a precarious balancing
act of supply and demand with its strategic reserves and the goodwill of a
few remaining countries. The success of the system so far is fundamental to
the regime's stability.
Diplomats and aid agency officials in Baghdad say some countries are
providing large quantities of food on a credit basis. Countries in
South-East Asia provide rice, Sudan exports meat, and Malaysia supplies palm
oil on credit.
Vietnam is repaying old debts in food subsidies, and Jordan has a tacitly
UN-approved agreement whereby it supplies goods in exchange for oil. The
kingdom imports about 8,500 tonnes of Iraqi crude oil and 2,000 tons of
light oil and fuel per each day. Less legitimate barter deals are reported
to be carried out with Iran and Turkey.
Where food is actually paid for, the government has been forced to use some
of its gold reserves to preserve its limited hard currency. Hard currency
earned from private Iraqi investment abroad is also believed to be
channelled into government funds in times of severe food shortages.
The fact that the regime, with extensive help from the UN and aid agencies,
has survived is a cause for frustration to those who predicted sudden
economic collapse when sanctions were imposed.
What is more, should a total breakdown in the system appear likely, the
Iraqi government is permitted under UN Resolutions 706 and 712 to sell
Dollars 1.6bn of oil to finance emergency humanitarian relief.
Attempts to control the free market economy, such as the ban last year on
luxury goods and the withdrawal of the prized old 25 dinar bank note in May,
have failed to curb inflation or stabilise the dinar. But the rationing
system has kept a large number of Iraqis from starving.
It is difficult to gauge the true level of popular support for Mr Saddam,
but despite the hardships he remains firmly in power. At least one western
ambassador in Baghdad argues that the idea that the US air attack on the
capital last week should serve as a catalyst for Mr Saddam's overthrow, as
US defence secretary Les Aspin has implied, is a misreading.
Military confrontation with the west has been shown to consolidate anti-west
feeling in Iraq and, therefore, support for the regime and it makes the
possibility of a political solution to the problem all the more difficult.
While there continues to be no settlement and sanctions remain, it is the
poor and vulnerable who suffer.

<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is expected to lift US opposition to Vietnam's
reinstatement in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
allowing the country to clear its arrears and resume borrowing from the
international development institutions.
A plan for France, the UK, Germany and Japan to provide bridging finance to
allow Vietnam to clear its Dollars 140m (Pounds 93.3m) arrears with the IMF
has been ready for some time now, but Vietnam's backers have been reluctant
to move ahead without at least an orange light from the US.
Vietnam experts say the country actually has enough currency reserves to pay
off the arrears on its own, however the bridging finance would avoid
jeopardising Vietnam's economic ratios while opening the door to financing
from the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
President Clinton is caught between US commercial interests, which have
watched angrily as other countries have entered the promising Vietnamese
market ahead of them, and between the emotionally powerful lobby of families
of US soldiers listed as missing in action during the Vietnam war.
Former President George Bush had outlined a 'road map' towards normal
relations with Vietnam.
This paired progress on the missing in action issue with a step by step
approach to the relaxation of US commercial sanctions.

THE MAN whose private army forced the elected president of Azerbaijan to
flee his post was yesterday named prime minister and 'supreme commander' of
the largely Moslem Caucasian republic.
Mr Surat Husseinov, aged 35, was nominated by Mr Gaidar Alyev, the former
Azeri Communist party leader who is now the powerful chairman of parliament.
He promised in a speech to the deputies that the creation of a national army
to prosecute the war against Armenia in Nagorno Karabakh would be 'among his
first steps'. He also promised to end the country's economic crisis and
ensure an adequate supply of food and other products to the population.
As part of an agreement thrashed out in the past three days between Mr Alyev
and Mr Husseinov the new prime minister will control the defence, interior
and security ministries, centralising all armed forces under his command.
He told parliament that 'the conditions already exist for ending the war
which has been thrust on Azerbaijan in the immediate future. If diplomatic
steps are not successful, then it will be done through war - and Azerbaijan
will win.'
Mr Alyev, who assumes the function of head of state relinquished by the
deposed President Abulfaz Elchibey, called for the people to unite to end
the 'civil' war in the country. He blamed Mr Elchibey, president for only a
year, for the collapse of the Azeri forces and the capture of Mardakaert,
the last Azeri-held town in the Armenian-dominated enclave of Karabakh.
Mr Husseinov sought to calm the fears of oil companies which had been
expecting to sign a Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.6m) deal with the Azeri
government this month to develop the rich reserves in the Caspian Sea,
saying 'the present government approach to this will be more sensible and
civilised'.

THE UN Security Council last night unanimously approved a three-month
extension, until September 30, of peacekeeping operations in the former
Yugoslav republics, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
Croatia, where 25 UN soldiers have been killed and 246 others wounded, had
wanted only a one-month extension while a broader enforcement mandate to
deal with Serb attacks might be negotiated. But Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, advised the council that this was not practicable. He
also rejected 'for the moment' the option of withdrawing UN peacekeepers
entirely from Croatia.
Earlier yesterday the council rejected a resolution to lift the arms embargo
against the Bosnian Moslems. The US backed the measure, parting company with
Britain, France and Russia, who abstained in the vote. As a result the
motion fell three votes short of the minimum necessary.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Bosnian Croat army issues general call-up: Moslem gains
prompt mobilisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Croat commanders yesterday ordered a general mobilisation as Moslem
forces tightened their grip in the battle for Mostar in south-western
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Moslem troops overran a Coat military base in Mostar after fierce fighting
and secured the northern approaches to the city, according to Sarajevo
radio.
The Moslem gains yesterday prompted Mr Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the
self-styled Croat state of Herceg-Bosnia, to order Bosnian Croat men between
the ages of 18 and 60 to report for military duty within 24 hours.
Moslems outnumber Croats, who comprised 17 per cent of Bosnia's pre-war
population of 4.3m. But Croat forces are better armed and have been
bolstered by reinforcements from Croatia.
The fighting at Mostar has reduced to rubble the regional capital of
south-western Bosnia-Hercegovina, which was heavily damaged last year by
Yugoslav army shelling.
Sarajevo radio reported that some 30,000 Moslems were trapped in the city,
with no food, medicine or electricity. It said Serbs and Croats yesterday
pressed on with their joint attack against the Moslem-led Bosnian army
around Maglaj and Zavidovici, Moslem-held towns in north-central Bosnia.
Reports said refugees streamed out of Novi Seher, a suburb of Maglaj, which
was set ablaze.
Corpses floated down the River Bosna which flows through both towns,
according to one report which could not be independently confirmed. UN
officials yesterday said Serb commanders had despatched tanks to fight
beside Croat forces around Maglaj.
Recent reports say Serb fighters have rented tanks to their one-time enemies
for DM500 (Pounds 200) a day. Tanjug, the Serbian news agency, denied that
Serbs and Croats had engaged in a joint assault against the Moslems.
The tenuous alliance between Croats and Moslems collapsed in April when
Croat forces moved to take control of key towns in central and southern
Bosnia.
In Sarajevo the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the surge in fighting
and a shortfall in contributions from donor nations meant food aid for more
than 1m people in central Bosnia would be halved over the next two months.
Reuter adds: Serbian authorities yesterday charged opposition leader Mr Vuk
Draskovic and his wife with assaulting a policeman and inciting a riot and
demanded they be held in custody pending trial, according to Tanjug.
The couple were arrested - and severely beaten - on June 2 after
anti-government riots in Belgrade in which a policeman was killed and many
protesters injured.

<TEXT>
Countries bordering the Black Sea countries yesterday agreed on a three-year
programme to protect the sea, which scientists say is doomed unless
pollution is tackled, Reuter reports. Officials said a meeting at the
Bulgarian port of Varna agreed to establish centres for protecting the sea -
rimmed by Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Romania and Turkey - and set
up a donor fund of some Dollars 32m. The money will be used for projects
approved by a donor commission.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Russian reform secures Dollars 1.5bn loan from IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund yesterday approved a new Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1bn) loan to Russia after extracting further market reforms from the
Russian authorities.
The money was approved by the IMF board yesterday evening after Mr Michel
Camdessus, the managing director, complained earlier this month that the
government and central bank were not doing enough to implement a statement
of intent promising further reform. Since then Moscow has produced a series
of measures to promote reform which IMF loans, such as this first half of a
so-called systemic transformation facility, are intended to support.
An IMF statement said the second half of the facility, which sets weaker
conditions than the Fund's traditional standby agreements, would be made
available to Russia provided progress continued to be made in implementing
anti-inflationary economic policies. Russia has aimed to conclude a standby
agreement, releasing a further Dollars 3bn, by October 1.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical finance minister who sees outside pressure as
a tool to help him overcome domestic resistance to painful reforms,
yesterday presented to parliament a revised budget adjusted to inflation,
and introducing new taxes to increase revenues. The revised budget proposes
a budget deficit of 10.4 per cent of gross domestic product as opposed to
12.2 per cent in the initial budget.
The new taxes include a 7 per cent levy on enterprise revenues to raise
subsidy money for coal and agriculture, an increase in oil excises from 18
to 30 per cent, and unspecified excise on gas.
On Tuesday the central bank increased the rate at which it lends money to
commercial banks from 120 to 140 per cent.
This brings it, as one western official put it, within striking distance of
achieving a promise that by mid-July this rate will not be more than 7
percentage points lower than an ill-defined market rate. When the statement
of intent was signed, the latter was just 150 per cent, despite annual
inflation of more than 1,000 per cent.
Mr Fyodorov has apparently stuck to limits he set for credit expansion in
the second quarter of this year. From today he has liberalised coal prices,
as part of promises to the Fund to remove existing price controls by the end
of this year.
Although parliament is expected today to give the government permission to
proceed with spending in the third quarter, it is expected to refuse to
approve the overall budget.
Having rejected the earlier budget, it is now demanding details on how the
government plans to spend money to support the country's ailing enterprises.
But the government has so far failed to produce a long-promised industrial
policy, partly because of internal divisions on what this should consist of.

command

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN whose private army forced the elected president of Azerbaijan to
flee his post was yesterday named prime minister and 'supreme commander' of
the largely Moslem Caucasian republic.
Mr Surat Husseinov, aged 35, was nominated by Mr Gaidar Alyev, the former
Azeri Communist party leader who is now the powerful chairman of parliament.
He promised in a speech to the deputies that the creation of a national army
to prosecute the war against Armenia in Nagorno Karabakh would be 'among his
first steps'. He also promised to end the country's economic crisis and
ensure an adequate supply of food and other products to the population.
As part of an agreement thrashed out in the past three days between Mr Alyev
and Mr Husseinov the new prime minister will control the defence, interior
and security ministries, centralising all armed forces under his command.
He told parliament that 'the conditions already exist for ending the war
which has been thrust on Azerbaijan in the immediate future. If diplomatic
steps are not successful, then it will be done through war - and Azerbaijan
will win.'
Mr Alyev, who assumes the function of head of state relinquished by the
deposed President Abulfaz Elchibey, called for the people to unite to end
the 'civil' war in the country. He blamed Mr Elchibey, president for only a
year, for the collapse of the Azeri forces and the capture of Mardakaert,
the last Azeri-held town in the Armenian-dominated enclave of Karabakh.
Mr Husseinov sought to calm the fears of oil companies which had been
expecting to sign a Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.6m) deal with the Azeri
government this month to develop the rich reserves in the Caspian Sea,
saying 'the present government approach to this will be more sensible and
civilised'.
However, he spoke after Mr Sabit Bagirov, head of the state oil company, had
given notice of his resignation, saying: 'I have received indications from
our new rulers that I am not wanted.' Mr Bagirov had negotiated the
contracts with companies including Amoco, British Petroleum and Pennzoil.
Mr Alyev and Mr Husseinov now face the immense task of restoring morale to
forces shattered by constant reversals while dealing with the refugee crisis
of many thousands.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most expensive hotel rooms in Europe last year were in Paris, followed
by Geneva, Madrid and London, according to a survey by leisure consultants
Pannell Kerr Forster.
The cheapest rooms were in Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Helsinki.
The average price paid for a quality hotel in Paris, as opposed to the
official rate charged, was FFr1,284 (Pounds 150). In London, the price was
Pounds 102.76. In Manchester, the cheapest of all 25 cities surveyed, the
average rate charged was Pounds 49.37 a night.
Edinburgh offered the biggest discounts on its official rates, with average
reductions of 44.8 per cent on offer to the traveller prepared to haggle.
Oslo was the second biggest discounter at 44.7 per cent, followed by
Manchester at 42.8 per cent and Athens with 40.1 per cent. Zurich was the
city with the smallest discount, 12.5 per cent, followed by Prague (14.5 per
cent) and Berlin (15.5 per cent).
Hotels in Prague had the highest occupancy of any large European city last
year, followed by Munich and Athens.
Prague hotel occupancy was 71.1 per cent in 1992, compared with 71.5 per
cent the previous year. Occupancy in Munich was 70.4 per cent, compared with
66.6 per cent in 1991. Athens, which had suffered badly during the Gulf war,
saw occupancy rise from 59.1 per cent in 1991 to 70.1 per cent last year.
Of Europe's main financial centres, London occupancy increased to 67.7 per
cent from 64.2 per cent in 1991 and Parisrose to 67.4 per cent from 62.8 per
cent. Occupancy in Frankfurt fell slightly from 70.5 per cent in 1991 to
69.2 per cent last year.
Helsinki was the city with the lowest occupancy, with only 51 per cent of
rooms full last year, compared with 55.1 per cent in 1991. Milan had the
second emptiest hotels with occupancy of 51.7 per cent, followed by
Birmingham (52.5 per cent) and Geneva (54.5 per cent).
Budapest and Prague had the largest number of foreign guests staying in
their quality hotels, with 98 per cent coming from abroad. In Brussels and
Warsaw, about 94 per cent of guests in quality hotels were foreign.
Birmingham had the fewest foreign hotel guests at 10 per cent.

<TEXT>
INFORMATION provided by the European Commission will from now on consist of
'the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth', pledged Mr Joao de
Deus Pinheiro, commissioner for internal political relations, announcing
Brussels' long-awaited new strategy of openness.
He hailed the new policy as 'a milestone' and 'a democratic approach', after
which the Commission would present information to the public and the media
on demand, speedily and without 'techno-babble'. The measure is intended to
clean up the image of the EC in general, and of the Commission in
particular.
All Commission documents would eventually be made available, he said, once a
system had been put in place to 'distinguish between those which are and
aren't' official policy. Draft documents, which reveal the preliminary
policy thinking of the EC's quasi-executive, should also be open to
scrutiny. Mindful of the controversy within the Commission over opening up
its workings to public view, Mr Pinheiro warned that 'the new policy will
only work if it is identified with by everybody'.
The commissioners themselves, some of whom are rarely if ever seen in
public, would come forward much more regularly to give an account of their
work, Mr Pinheiro said.
'People want more information, better explanations and a faster service,'
says the document approved by Brussels yesterday. 'What they do not want are
propaganda and platitudes.'

<TEXT>
MR Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, has been forced to
cancel a meeting in Edinburgh next week for 14 right-wing Euro-MPs, after
hotels there refused to host it.
Mr Le Pen is instead to try to hold the meeting in Dublin. It is one of a
controversial series of alleged work meetings of the European Right group in
the European Parliament, being financed by EC taxpayers.
Parliament officials in Brussels said the Edinburgh Sheraton cancelled the
Le Pen group's reservations, and that parliamentary staff had refused to
help in finding an alternative. Edinburgh's city council had also denied the
group access to its premises.
Mr Le Pen was seeking reservations at the Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel in
Dublin, they said.
The European Right group issued a statement yesterday protesting that the
hoteliers of Edinburgh were forced by threats to refuse any meeting in
Scotland.
Mr Glyn Ford, a leader of the UK Labour party in the European Parliament,
said he was 'delighted the people of Scotland have shunned this odious man',
and was sure Dubliners would also be outraged.
The Edinburgh cancellation follows mounting controversy over the cost and
purpose of the Le Pen group's meetings.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Signal to Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bonn coalition's DM25bn (Pounds 9.8bn) savings package was widely hailed
yesterday as a signal for the Bundesbank to resume cutting key interest
rates - but there was no agreement on when the first move would come.
Today's meeting of the central bank's policy-making council in Leipzig was
considered too early by Mr Rudiger Pohl, a member of the government's
council of economic advisers.
He believed the bank might delay action until the political fate of the
contentious package, based on cuts in social spending, was clearer.
Financial market traders were also sceptical, even though the bank early
yesterday gave a further downward nudge to the securities repurchase rate,
at which it supplies markets with wholesale funds.
A cut from 7.59 to 7.58 per cent - the smallest possible - had been expected
and gave no grounds for immediate optimism, one trader said. However, as
several observers pointed out, after today's meeting only two more council
sessions are scheduled before the long summer break.
Strains in the economy alone pointed to the need for some encouragement from
the central bank sometime this month.
Despite the Bundesbank's repeated attempts to talk up the state of the
economy, calls are increasing from industry for further rates relief. Mr
Tyll Necker, president of the BDI federal industry confederation, said
earlier this week that the end of the slump had not been reached and all
indicators were still pointing downwards. Private sector economists have
this week downgraded their forecasts and now expect the west German economy
to shrink by up to 3 per cent in 1993.
The government, too, wants some help to divert further criticism of German
fiscal laxity and monetary rigidity expected at this month's summit of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Tokyo. Chancellor Helmut Kohl
would draw attention to the deficit-reduction package at the talks, Mr
Dieter Vogel, the official government spokesman, said.
The planned cuts would help put an end to uncertainty about the stability of
the D-Mark, he added, and create conditions for further rate cuts.
Reductions in social supports would make them a less attractive alternative
to working.

FT  01 JUL 93 / 'Ja' we have cheap bananas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is one true symbol of German unification it should be the beloved
banana, they say in the Berlin backstreets.
When east Germany left the grim, fruit-free world of Communist rule and
joined the bulging materialism of its western sister state, the most
extraordinary change came in the consumption of bananas.
East Germans proceeded to celebrate their new-found freedom by devouring no
less than 26kg per head per year, way over the EC average of 11kg per head.
With imports running at 2.4m tonnes a year, Germany is now by far the
largest banana-eating nation in the industrialised world. Which is precisely
why the new European Community regime to curb cheap imports of so-called
'dollar bananas' from Latin America, and favour the dearer and humbler
products of the Caribbean and Africa, is a subject of national outrage.
Stickers abound in car windscreens and shop windows, urging fellow citizens
in Gothic script to be patriotic and 'eat German bananas'. The decision on
Tuesday by the European court of justice to reject Bonn's plea for an
injunction to stop the new banana import regime is therefore a new blow to
Germany's traditional loyalty to the EC.
It comes on the eve of the oral hearing, in Germany's own constitutional
court in Karlsruhe, on whether the Maastricht treaty on European union is
compatible with the German constitution. Some would see it as an ominous
reminder that, when a real German issue is at stake, devotion to the cause
of European integration evaporates.
They point to the famous battle over the German Reinheitsgebot, which
demands that all beer brewed in Germany be free of all artificial additives,
as it was in Bavaria in the 16th century.
And at the heart of the opposition to Maastricht is the ordinary German's
devotion to the D-Mark. The Karlsruhe court is unlikely to decide on
Maastricht before September. Few Germans will understand the legal niceties.
But they all understand the threat to their money, their beer, and their
bananas.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S main parliamentary groups have given the go-ahead to the plan
which will pave the way for the eventual privatisation of Deutsche Telekom,
the telecommunication monopoly.
However, the plan was criticised by the German chamber of commerce and
industry, which yesterday said that creating a state-controlled holding
company would hinder the international competitiveness of Deutsche Telekom.
The German industry federation was critical, too. Mr Tyll Necker, its
president, said 'the ability of Deutsche Telekom to go to the stock market
will not be secured under the present privatisation plan'.
In an internal vote, the parliamentary groups of both the governing parties
and the opposition Social Democrats voted for a government plan which will
allow Deutsche Telekom to start selling shares on the stock exchange as
early as the middle of 1996.
The plan foresees the creation of three separate joint-stock companies for
Deutsche Telekom, the postal service and the postal bank. These would
operate under a state holding company.
The holding company would retain a 50 per cent stake in Deutsche Telekom as
long as the latter has a monopoly in basic telephone services and lines. The
majority stake would be relinquished once the European telecoms market is
opened up in 1998, as recently agreed by the EC.
The plan also provides for the holding company to oversee the maintainance
of the telecom infrastructure.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Pension fund move shelved: Twelve have second thoughts on
liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long-awaited European Community directive liberalising pension fund
investment has effectively been scrapped because some member states believed
it went too far towards encouraging investment outside their home markets.
At a June 14 meeting of the internal market council members voted to refer
the matter back to a working party where it hoped a compromise might be
reached. The wording of the draft document, hammered out after two years of
talks, must now be renegotiated.
'There is a general agreement building up at the Commission that this text
is an unhappy one,' said Mr Koen de Ryck, permanent representative of the
European Federation of Retired Persons, a trade association for Europe's
pension funds industry.
The directive's key elements were rules barring countries from requiring
pension funds to hold a minimum of their investments in certain asset
categories and allowing up to 40 per cent of assets to be invested in
non-domestic currencies.
The directive was also opposed by the UK fund management industry, which
believed that the currency diversification rules did not go far enough.
Britain had urged that the directive contain no restrictions on currencies
but should instead require 'prudent' investment by pension funds. One
stumbling block is understood to have came from the Dutch, who sought to
exclude its ABP civil service pension scheme from the directive. The fund,
the Netherlands' largest, is only allowed to invest up to 5 per cent of its
assets abroad and the Dutch government feared disinvestment in local
markets.
The French objected to rules allowing fund managers to select a custodian
for assets outside the country. Arguments put forward by Paris and backed by
the Italians, Spanish and others, were that pension schemes wanted their
assets reassuringly and safely nearby.
They also wanted the directive to spell out more clearly the requirement of
regulators to co-operate closely in their supervisory duties.

INTEREST RATES
Worried about the effect of high German rates on the French economy, Paris
wants the Bundesbank council to cut rates at its meeting today. France has
reduced short-term rates eight times since early April, putting its
short-term rates below those of Germany's. As a result, further French cuts
are becoming more dependent on Bundesbank action.
BOSNIA
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plea at last week's European Community
summit meeting for the possible lifting of the arms embargo against
Bosnia-Hercegovina's Moslems took France, as well as other EC countries, by
surprise.
ERM
As investors worry about the German economy and France brings down
short-term interest rates below German levels, the French franc has
attracted solid support on the foreign exchanges, threatening the German
mark's anchor function in the ERM.
BANANAS
Germany, whose people eat more bananas per head by far than anywhere else in
the world, is outraged by the European Community regime to restrict cheap
imports. Germany blames above all the French government, which it sees as
seeking to defend the interests of its foreign territories and former
colonies at the expense of free trade.
GATT
France, which views the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a vehicle
for US trade hegemonism, finds itself at odds with Germany. On the sensitive
issue of Gatt-proposed farm trade reform, France is adamant that it cannot
accept the deal negotiated by the EC with strong German support.
TELECOMS
Germany says that its 1954 trade treaty with the US prevents it from
implementing EC trade sanctions against US companies. France, supported by
some other EC countries, is incensed and strongly supports the the European
Commission's view that Germany is breaching community law.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Pique in Paris as Germans refuse to cross the Rhine
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'BEYOND the turbulences of the moment, which are inevitable, the
French-German relationship will keep the depth and the permanence which are
necessary for both Europe and France.' This was the rather portentous way in
which Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, sought yesterday in the
National Assembly to soothe anxious questioners about the currently shaky
state of the Paris-Bonn axis.
Independent French experts on relations across the Rhine concur in the basic
solidity of the alliance. Ms Anne-Marie Le Gloannec of the Centre d'Etudes
et Recherches Internationales pointed out yesterday that France and Germany
have successfully weathered previous hiccups in their relationship, notably
the initial hostile reaction of many French politicians in 1989-90 to the
prospect of German unification. But there is clear concern in France at the
proliferating pinpricks between Paris and Bonn. 'They should not be
dramatised, but neither should they be underestimated,' said Mr Juppe
yesterday. 'None of the disagreements are about anything as spectacular as
German unification, but the fact that they are so numerous, ranging from
monetary policy and Gatt to bananas and waste recycling, makes them harder
to manage,' commented Ms Le Gloannec.
They are compounded by the fact that the new Balladur government is proving
more assertive of French interests than its socialist predecessor. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, carried this too far last week by
appearing to summon his German opposite numbers to Paris for talks on
'concerted' interest rate cuts, while at the same time claiming that an
increasing number of countries seemed to be looking to the Bank of France
rather than the Bundesbank for the lead in lowering the cost of money in
Europe.
Not surprisingly, the Germans refused to cross the Rhine last week. But the
view in Mr Alphandery's own ministry is that their minister's gaffe does not
change 'the fundamentals' which remain in France's favour. These are that
France has lower inflation, and less depressing prospects for growth and for
budget deficits, than Germany's. Therefore, France, like the Netherlands,
will be able to keep its short- and medium-term interest rates below those
of Germany, and may be able to cut rates a little bit more, independently of
whatever the Bundesbank does.
Virtually every minister in the Balladur government believes, or hopes, this
will eventually bring recovery in France. The one exception is Mr Alain
Madelin, the minister in charge of small business, who in an interview
yesterday complained that 'the franc's link to the D-Mark imposes a floor on
French short-term rates, which can no longer drop significantly below German
rates, as France's situation demands'. But the maverick Mr Madelin did not
go as far as urging publicly any change in the franc/D-Mark parity.
Mr Balladur has not yet struck any close relationship with Chancellor Kohl,
whose relationship with President Mitterrand remains closer. It has
therefore become essential for the French prime minister that his
'cohabitation' with Mr Mitterrand stay as smooth as possible. He is banking
strongly on Mr Mitterrand using his influence with Mr Kohl, both at the
Tokyo summit next week and later.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Shocking words upset the EC's oldest family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARELY 10 days ago, on the eve of the EC summit in Copenhagen, shocking
words were spoken in a remote committee room of the German Bundestag.
'Maastricht is dead,' was one of the more dramatic expressions. 'Social
cohesion,' alias trade protectionism, was trumpeted as the answer to
Europe's economic misery. The negotiations for liberalisation of the Gatt
were denounced as dangerous, irrelevant and unnecessary.
The perpetrators of these heresies, for that is how they sounded in the
German parliament, were not German parliamentarians, but a dozen leading
French deputies. The vehemence of their attack took their German hosts by
surprise.
The mood in Paris is certainly causing some concern in Bonn, just as the
contrary is no doubt true, that Germany is obsessed with its internal
problems of unification. There is tension on the age-old issue of free trade
versus protectionism; there is tension over monetary policy, and the
determination of the Bundesbank to cut its high interest rates at a
tortoise-like pace; there are clear disagreements over policy towards the
former Yugoslavia, with Bonn's frustration at its powerlessness
self-evident.
And yet, in spite of it all, the Franco-German relationship remains,
apparently unperturbed, if just a little anxious. 'There are problems like
this in every family,' says an official of the German Bundesbank.
The official in question was referring to the latest spat between Paris and
Bonn sparked by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister. Whether
under the influence of post-electoral euphoria, prompted by bare-faced
cheek, or demonstrating a remarkable ignorance of German sensitivities, he
announced in a radio broadcast on Thursday that he had summoned Mr Theo
Waigel, his German counterpart, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of
the Bundesbank, to a meeting in Paris the following day. His purpose was to
give the pair a good dressing-down on Germany's high interest rates, and set
the guidelines for proper co-ordination of Franco-German monetary policy, he
suggested.
When Mr Waigel promptly cancelled the meeting - a routine session of the
Franco-German economic and finance council - there was scarcely any surprise
in Bonn. For Mr Alphandery had dared to intrude on the sacred independence
of the Bundesbank, and suggest that it could be subjected to political
pressure. Mr Waigel dared not be seen as a co-conspirator.
At the highest levels in Bonn, there is understanding for Mr Alphandery's
dilemma. 'The French government has to survive an extraordinarily difficult
first six months,' according to one well-placed official.
'The popular pressures for protectionism, and abandonment of the franc fort,
are very real. But if Mr Balladur can get through the first six months, I
think relations will be back on an even keel.'
There is also nervousness. 'Each of these problems individually is
manageable,' according to a parliamentary foreign affairs specialist. 'If
they all come up together, then it will be difficult.'
Yet there may be less sympathy in the country at large than there is in the
corridors of power in Bonn, where relations with Paris are bound by 'cords
of steel' in the words of a senior diplomat.
One sensitive popular issue is former Yugoslavia, where German sympathies
lie overwhelmingly with Croatia, and the Bosnian Moslems, and against the
perceived aggression of Serbia.
Perhaps even more explosive is the issue of bananas. France is seen as the
prime mover behind another example of EC protectionism, which threatens to
force up the price of Germany's cheap banana imports from Latin America by
almost 100 per cent, in order to favour expensive fruit from French
territories.
'It is to the French we owe these expensive bananas,' according to Ms
Angelika Volle at the German foreign policy institute.
'That is one issue making public opinion in Germany less positive than that
of the political leadership.
'The relationship has become less active, and more reactive.
'We still have to go along with them, but because there is no alternative,'
Ms Volle said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE cohabitation alliance between France's veteran Socialist president, Mr
Francois Mitterrand, and the new conservative prime minister, Mr Edouard
Balladur, is gaining popularity according to the latest opinion poll.
Mr Mitterrand, whose popularity fell sharply during the final months of the
old Socialist government, saw his approval rating rise by 5 percentage
points to 46 per cent in May, according to a BVA-Paris Match survey. Mr
Balladur's rating rose by 2 points to 59 per cent. The president and prime
minister appear to have won the electorate's approval because of their
conciliatory approach to cohabitation. The last cohabitation administration,
from 1986 to 1988, was scarred by frequent rows between the president and Mr
Jacques Chirac, the centre-right prime minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INFORMATION provided by the European Commission will from now on consist of
'the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth', pledged Mr Joao de
Deus Pinheiro, commissioner for internal political relations, announcing
Brussels' long-awaited new strategy of openness.
He hailed the new policy as 'a milestone' and 'a democratic approach', after
which the Commission would present information to the public and the media
on demand, speedily and without 'techno-babble'. The measure is intended to
clean up the image of the EC in general, and of the Commission in
particular.
All Commission documents would eventually be made available, he said, once a
system had been put in place to 'distinguish between those which are and
aren't' official policy. Draft documents, which reveal the preliminary
policy thinking of the EC's quasi-executive, should also be open to
scrutiny. Mindful of the controversy within the Commission over opening up
its workings to public view, Mr Pinheiro warned that 'the new policy will
only work if it is identified with by everybody'.
The commissioners themselves, some of whom are rarely if ever seen in
public, would come forward much more regularly to give an account of their
work, Mr Pinheiro said. 'It's important that there should be full disclosure
of the Commission's views.'
'People want more information, better explanations and a faster service,'
says the document approved by Brussels yesterday. 'What they do not want are
propaganda and platitudes.'
Throughout the Commission departments there will now be an official
designated to provide information requested by the public and the press. A
small strategy group will monitor the overall political coherence of
Commission information, while a steering committee based on its information
directorate will examine whether information is meeting the specific needs
of those seeking it.
In addition, feedback should come from an external users' advisory council,
made up of business, trade unions, the professions, civic groups and the
press.
Although the Commission has now made its move, the Community's council of
ministers has still to make up its mind on the possibility of freedom of
information rules, allowing the public access to all EC documents on the US
or Scandinavian model.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Telekom plan approved: German vote puts company on road to
market

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S main parliamentary groups have given the go-ahead to the plan
which will pave the way for the eventual privatisation of Deutsche Telekom,
the state-owned telecommunication monopoly.
However, the plan was criticised by the German chamber of commerce and
industry, which yesterday said that creating a state-controlled holding
company would hinder the international competitiveness of Deutsche Telekom.
The German industry federation was critical, too. Mr Tyll Necker, its
president, said 'the ability of Deutsche Telekom to go to the stock market
will not be secured under the present privatisation plan'.
In an internal vote, the parliamentary groups of both the governing parties
and the opposition Social Democrats voted for a government plan which will
allow Deutsche Telekom to start selling shares on the stock exchange as
early as the middle of 1996.
The plan foresees the creation of three separate joint-stock companies for
Deutsche Telekom, the postal service and the postal bank. These would
operate under a state holding company.
The holding company would retain a 50 per cent stake in Deutsche Telekom as
long as the latter has a monopoly in basic telephone services and lines. The
majority stake would be relinquished once the European telecoms market is
opened up in 1998, as recently agreed by the EC.
The plan further provides for the holding company to oversee the
maintainance of the telecommunications infrastructure, and to settle wage
agreements which would apply jointly to all three joint-stock companies.
These clauses could significantly restrict Deutsche Telekom's independence.
Several key issues remain are unresolved. The government and the Social
Democrats still have to work out exactly how the tasks of the holding
company will be carried out. They also have to discuss the controversial
issue of how much financial control the holding company will have over
Deutsche Telekom. These will have to be negotiated over the summer.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Bundesbank given rates signal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bonn coalition's DM25bn (Pounds 9.8bn) savings package was widely hailed
yesterday as a signal for the Bundesbank to resume cutting key interest
rates - but there was no agreement on when the first move would come.
Today's meeting of the central bank's policy-making council in Leipzig was
considered too early by Mr Rudiger Pohl, a member of the government's
council of economic advisers.
He believed the bank might delay action until the political fate of the
contentious package, based on cuts in social spending, was clearer.
Financial market traders were also sceptical, even though the bank early
yesterday gave a further downward nudge to the securities repurchase rate,
at which it supplies markets with wholesale funds.
A cut from 7.59 to 7.58 per cent - the smallest possible - had been expected
and gave no grounds for immediate optimism, one trader said. However, as
several observers pointed out, after today's meeting only two more council
sessions are scheduled before the long summer break.
Strains in the economy alone pointed to the need for some encouragement from
the central bank sometime this month.
Despite the Bundesbank's repeated attempts to talk up the state of the
economy, calls are increasing from industry for further rates relief. Mr
Tyll Necker, president of the BDI federal industry confederation, said
earlier this week that the end of the slump had not been reached and all
indicators were still pointing downwards.
Private sector economists have this week downgraded their forecasts and now
expect the west German economy to shrink by up to 3 per cent in 1993. The
government, too, wants some help to divert further criticism of German
fiscal laxity and monetary rigidity expected at next month's summit of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Tokyo. Chancellor Helmut Kohl
would draw attention to the deficit-reduction package at the talks, Mr
Dieter Vogel, the official government spokesman, said.
The planned cuts would help put an end to uncertainty about the stability of
the D-Mark, he added, and create conditions for further rate cuts.
Reductions in social supports would make them a less attractive alternative
to working. Deutsche Bank, with especially close links to industry, was
among the more bullish proponents of immediate cuts. Mr Axel Siedenberg, an
economist in the bank's research division, said he expected at least a
quarter-point reduction today in the 7.25 per cent discount and the 8.50 per
cent Lombard rates.
He pointed to the expected return of monetary growth to the Bundesbank's
target range, a further easing of inflation, and continuing falls in import
prices.
Although import prices in May fell 0.3 per cent to stand 3.6 per cent lower
than a year earlier, other economists pointed out that the recent rise of
the dollar against the D-Mark would quickly push them up again.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IS a flesh-pumping Flemish Christian Democrat with a passion for
football; the other is a high-brow Flemish Socialist who conducts orchestras
in his spare time. Meet Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, and
Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, two newcomers on the European
scene who will be running the European Community for the next six months.
Today Belgium takes over the rotating EC presidency from Denmark. Mr Dehaene
and Mr Claes can barely disguise their satisfaction. After the niggling
nationalism of the previous British and Danish presidencies,
federalist-minded Belgium is pressing for a return to Community orthodoxy.
'We need more Europe, not less Europe,' says Mr Dehaene.
Beyond the slogan lie two goals: to restore the authority of the European
Commission as policy-motor and arbiter between the 12 member states; and to
apply the provisions of the Maastricht treaty, assuming, of course, that it
survives the final stage of ratification in the UK and a legal challenge in
Germany.
Neither task will be easy. The mood in the Community remains sour, best
captured by tensions between France and Germany over trade and interest
rates. Unemployment in the EC will pass the 18m mark by the end of the year.
The EC remains becalmed.
Yet the pressure is on the Belgians as a founder member of the EC to end the
drift which began, just over a year ago, when Danish voters narrowly voted
to reject Maastricht. The stakes are high: the next three EC presidencies -
Greece, Germany and France - all face election campaigns in the next 18
months in which support for Maastricht could be a liability.
Viscount Etienne Davignon, chairman of the conglomerate Societe Generale de
Belgique, argues that credible progress toward monetary union must be made
during the Belgian presidency. The challenge is to formulate a deal on the
site of the new European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European
central bank, which will supervise operation of the putative single European
currency. Belgium is a great enthusiast for the single currency, but its
credibility as a member of the 'hard core' currency bloc built around the
D-Mark took a knock recently.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, finance minister, suggested that the Maastricht
criteria for reducing budget deficits might have to be relaxed if the
recession continued well into 1994. Mr Maystadt subsequently said he had
been misquoted, but the impression of wavering lingered.
Belgium also wants to make Maastricht's provisions for a common EC foreign
and security policy work. This may seem remote after the disarray over
former Yugoslavia; but Belgium is looking for less controversial areas where
the 12 can agree to 'joint actions'.
An important behind-the-scenes figure over the next six months will be
Philippe de Schoutheete de Tervarent, Belgian's veteran ambassador to the EC
and an expert in the foreign policy provisions of the treaty. He is a
believer in process as much as concrete action.
'The Belgians are playing a long game,' says one EC diplomat. 'They want to
encourage the correct habits.'
By contrast, the British and Danish presidencies are seen as having
introduced bad habits. Their enthusiasm for speedy enlargement of the EC to
include Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden by 1995 is not shared in
Brussels; nor is the Danish push for more televised ministerial meetings.
Five-minute sound-bites on camera are not the best way to restore EC
credibility, says Mr Claes.
On the positive side, Denmark succeeded in liberalising the EC road haulage
market, as well as presiding over the acceleration of the economic and
political integration of central and eastern Europe into the EC, which
included more generous market access agreements.
But too often its ambitions were overshadowed by the imperative of securing
a Yes in the second referendum at the end of May and a quaint nationalism.
No doubt, EC diplomats will be relieved that the question of whether to fly
the Danish flag outside the White House will not dominate planning for an
EC-US summit; on the other hand, they may miss the way in which the Queen of
Denmark could throw EC protocol to the wind by issuing an invitation to Mr
Boris Yeltsin in the middle of planning for an EC-Russia summit.
At the very least, they must hope that Belgium's fragile coalition
government will last longer than the Danish coalition last January. Two
weeks into the presidency it fell victim to a scandal over the treatment of
Tamil refugees.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Tax official 'gave Nadir details to Stock Exchange':
Solicitor confirms link in Revenue inquiries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, JIMMY BURNS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Inland Revenue official passed information about Mr Asil Nadir's
affairs to the London Stock Exchange in the months before Mr Nadir's arrest,
according to a solicitor acting for the official.
Mr Michael Jones, a solicitor acting for Mr Michael Allcock, the suspended
head of the Inland Revenue's special section 2, which deals with high
profile tax investigations, confirmed yesterday that his client had been
'instrumental in the detection of Mr Nadir's affairs and the subsequent
referral thereof to the Serious Fraud Office'.
He said that Mr Allcock passed some of the information he had gathered from
his investigation to the Stock Exchange. It is understood that the Exchange
and the Inland Revenue have in the past swapped information on an informal
basis.
The Inland Revenue said yesterday that it was prevented by law from
disclosing information on taxpayers' affairs to third parties, including the
police, other than in highly exceptional circumstances.
In his resignation speech on Tuesday, Mr Michael Mates, former Northern
Ireland Minister, said there had been improper collusion between a senior
officer of the Inland Revenue and the SFO.
It appears that Mr Allcock did not deal directly with the SFO, but passed
some information to the Insider Trading Unit of the Stock Exchange. The
Exchange yesterday refused to comment.
The political storm over the activities of the SFO also took a new twist
yesterday as a senior Liberal Democrat MP made fresh allegations over the
SFO's handling of a separate investigation.
The accusations came straight after Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, had promised to publish letters between himself and Mr
Mates, as he responded in detail to the sensational claims about the SFO's
handling of the case against Mr Nadir.
Cross-party concern among MPs was intensified by the revelation that an SFO
official had last year forged a letter purporting to come from Sir David
Steel, the senior Liberal Democrat MP, in a separate case, related to the
collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Sir Nicholas said he had apologised for the forgery, which he admitted was
'a very serious error of judgment, a stupid thing to do'. He described it as
'an April Fool's joke' and said the matter had been dealt with internally.
Sir David said that from October 1991 he had raised with the then
attorney-general the handling by the SFO of the investigation of Control
Securities Ltd, whose chairman and chief executive, Mr Nazmu Virani, he knew
slightly. In March 1992, Mr Virani was charged with an offence of conspiracy
to defraud, and just before the first court hearing, at which the SFO
opposed bail, an SFO official showed his solicitor a letter purporting to be
from Sir David, saying that he would be attending the hearing.
Meanwhile, Sir Nicholas's insistence that there was no basis for an
independent inquiry into the charges made by Mr Mates was broadly accepted
at Westminster. But the opposition is still determined that the names of the
other MPs who made representations on behalf of Mr Nadir should be
disclosed.
An edited version of the letters about the accusations in Mr Mates's
extraordinary resignation speech will be published shortly, probably today,
but Sir Nicholas dealt with the main claims yesterday.
On the most serious claim that the SFO had tried to put 'im-proper pressure'
on the trial judge, he said the alleged conspiracy to bribe the judge was
being separately investigated by the police under the supervision of the
director of public prosecutions. This had revealed no 'credible evidence'
implicating the judge personally.
He admitted that two bags containing some privileged legal documents had
been opened in error by some police officers, but said other papers and
effects taken on behalf of the trustee in bankruptcy had been taken in
accordance with a court order.
Mr John Fraser, Labour's legal affairs spokesman, expressed scepticism at Mr
Mates's claims, but shared the unease at the idea that the SFO sought to
generate publicity for arrests and gave the media advance information.
Sir Nicholas said he deplored this, and had repeatedly raised the issue with
Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, but that the number of people who
needed advance warning of arrests meant there was plenty of scope for the
media to be tipped off or to draw their own inferences.
Sir Nicholas emphasised throughout that, apart from the publicity attaching
to the arrests, the matters raised related to the court proceedings, and
thus were essentially for the trial judge.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Security ring around the City to combat terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECURITY CORDON of 24-hour police checkpoints is to be thrown around the
City of London as part of an anti-terrorist campaign after recent bomb
attacks.
The measures, backed by the Home Office, will be put into operation this
weekend.
Police at the six main routes into the City will monitor and stop suspicious
vehicles. Other entry roads will be blocked.
The measures, due to stay in place for a year, are the first stage in a
broader plan to be announced at the end of the week. Non-essential traffic
would be restricted, and police and video camera surveillance increased. The
moves will probably need parliamentary approval.
Mr Owen Kelly, the commissioner of the City of London Police, met Mr Michael
Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of London's policy committee, yesterday
to finalise details.
Mr Cassidy said the area covered by the security ring would be 'considerably
smaller' than the square mile, focusing on the Bank of England headquarters.
The checkpoints would not act as road blocks and 'most people will probably
notice no difference'.
'This is not a 'ring of steel' around the City,' he added.
Against a background of concern that the measures might be seen as an IRA
propaganda coup, the Corporation of London was at pains to play down the
move. It pointed out that vehicle surveillance was already carried out in
the City, after the Bishopsgate bombing two months ago.
City businesses and banks gave the proposals a cautious welcome, although
they emphasised that until the fuller set of proposals was in force, it
would be impossible to predict the impact on the City's reputation.
'As long as emergency vehicle access was maintained, and the City was able
to function as a financial institution, we would welcome the tightening of
security,' the Stock Exchange said.

FT  01 JUL 93 / New Bank head sees potential for lasting recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN HAS the potential for an economic recovery that could continue
through the rest of this decade, according to Mr Eddie George, the new
governor of the Bank of England.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr George said the UK had a
'realistic chance of seeing rather well sustained expansion', although he
admitted that the start of the recovery would be gradual because of the
large overhang of debt in the private sector.
While making clear his doubts about the European Community's plans for
economic and monetary union, Mr George, who became governor today, said he
believed Britain would be able to meet the convergence criteria laid out in
the Maastricht Treaty 'over the Maastricht time scale'.
His remarks suggested that the UK's ratio of annual budget deficit to gross
domestic product would fall to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by the
end of the decade from about 8 per cent projected by the Treasury for this
financial year, and that Britain would, as now, have an inflation rate in
line with the best performing EC member states at the end of the 1990s.
However, Mr George admitted that 'we could always throw it away, either
through policy errors or in the economy at large through bad behaviour'. But
he said he believed that Mr Kenneth Clarke, in describing himself as a
'political chancellor', would pursue 'prudent policies which offer the best
chance of achieving sustainable recovery and sustainable expansion'.
Mr George told the FT that he was content with the current level of UK
interest rates and sterling's exchange rate.
But yesterday afternoon, when giving testimony to the House of Commons
Treasury and Civil Service Committee, he said 'some weight' could be taken
off UK interest rates if the government succeeded in cutting its public
sector borrowing requirement from the current level of Pounds 50bn a year.
He added that another factor that would 'tend to ease pressure' on British
interest rates would be a fall in German rates. Mr George told the FT and
admitted to MPs that there were cases in the past when the tactics
surrounding UK interest rate changes had been determined by political rather
than monetary policy considerations.
The results had been damaging for the UK economy 'for a little while,' he
said.
He indicated that the differences had not been so serious as to cause the
Bank to 'make a song and dance' about the matter.
In his comments to the Commons committee, Mr George promised that the Bank
would be more open to outside scrutiny under his governorship and went
further than in his FT interview in outlining the greater autonomy that he
would like for the Bank of England.
He said he would favour the Bank being given a 'mandate' from parliament
which would set price stability as its objective and give it the tools to
achieve this through the setting of short-term interest rates.
But the Bank would have to be made accountable to parliament and he was
reluctant to define how this should be done. However, greater accountability
would make it easier to identify those responsible for economic policy
errors in the UK, he said.
The hearing in the Commons also threw more light on the role that Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea would play as deputy governor of the Bank. He would 'run the
Bank', Mr George said.
The new governor said he regarded Mr Pennant-Rea, who until recently was the
editor of the Economist magazine, as 'a co-governor' rather than his deputy.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Hanson in Dollars 3.2bn deal for Quantum Chemical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday launched an agreed
Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.13bn) bid for Quantum Chemical Corporation of the
US. The price includes Dollars 720m for Quantum's share capital plus the
assumption of Quantum's Dollars 2.5bn of debt.
Quantum, formed in 1987 from National Distillers &amp; Chemical after it sold
its wine and liquor business, and refinanced with heavy borrowings in 1988,
is the leading US manufacturer of polyethylene, a plastic used in packaging,
and products such as toys and automotive components. It is the second
largest retail supplier of propane gas.
The bid marks Hanson's return to the acquisition trail after its failed
Pounds 780m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK food company, launched in
October. Hanson was beaten when rival UK conglomerate Tomkins topped its
offer. It also follows Hanson's purchase of a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial
Chemical Industries in 1991 which, despite fierce speculation, never led to
a bid.
The Quantum bid illustrates the changing style of Hanson's acquisitions.
Lord Hanson, chairman, said: 'Hanson's objective for the 1990s is to build
up its major businesses, while being prepared to make major acquisitions
when the opportunity presents itself. Quantum fits this perfectly.' Mr Derek
Bonham, Hanson's chief executive, said he expected the acquisition would
make 'a positive contribution to Hanson earnings in 1993-94'.
Quantum's profits have slumped in recent years as overcapacity has hit
polyethylene prices. Lord Hanson said the deal had been struck 'near the
bottom of this industry's cycle'.
Mr David Clarke, chief executive officer of Hanson Industries, the
conglomerate's US arm, said a small increase in prices would have a large
impact on profits.
In 1988, the peak of the last cycle, Quantum's operating income was Dollars
759.8m, but in 1992 this fell to Dollars 61.4m. Quantum has also been
burdened with heavy debt. Interest charges have pushed it into losses in
1991 and 1992 and it has a balance sheet deficit of Dollars 471.1m. Hanson
is offering 1.176 of its American Depository Receipts, which each represent
five ordinary shares, for each Quantum share. That values the target's
equity at Dollars 20 a share or at Dollars 720m in all. The share offer
would add 4 per cent to Hanson's share capital.
Quantum is paying interest rates of more than 10 per cent on its debt while
Hanson pays about 5 per cent on its US borrowings. Hanson also plans to
continue cost cutting programmes.
It hopes to complete the deal by September 30, its financial year end. The
company's shares responded with a 4p rise to a London close of 226 1/2 p.
Quantum's shares closed in New York up Dollars 6 1/2 at Dollars 19.

FT  01 JUL 93 / Nissan UK chief jailed for 8 years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Hunt, the managing director of Nissan UK, the former West
Sussex-based car importers, was yesterday jailed for eight years for his
part in Britain's largest-ever tax fraud.
Mr Hunt, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court with his wife, Shirley,
was convicted on Saturday of conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of
Pounds 55m in corporation tax by helping artificially to inflate freight
charges for Nissan cars imported to the UK from Japan.  Sentencing him, the
judge said the offence was 'in a category of its own'.
