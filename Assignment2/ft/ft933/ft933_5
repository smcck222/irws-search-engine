under way - World banking / John Gapper suggests the long-term prognosis may
not be good

BRIAN PEARSE, chief executive of the UK's Midland Bank, likens banks to the
victims of a car accident. 'As you come out of it, you not only have to
recover your poise, but learn some new tricks as well,' he says. The
convalescence from the accident of asset quality problems in the 1980s is
well under way.
But while the health of the patient is better than at any time in the past
five years, the long-term prognosis may not be good. The recovery of the
banking systems in the US and Europe has not gainsaid questions whether
banks have a permanent role as lending institutions for corporate customers.
The accident that befell banks in the 1980s followed the deregulation of
financial systems in the US and Europe, and asset price inflation in the
late 1980s. Banks competed for growth by cutting margins - notably in big
corporate lending - only to be hit by recession across OECD economies.
US banks were first to recover strongly, helped by a strong positive yield
curve that allowed banks to rebuild capital by holding treasury assets. Tier
one ratios of core capital to risk-weighted assets are now commonly one or
two percentage points above the 6 per cent 'well-capitalised' level.
However, this has been followed by a series of resurgences in European
banking systems as bad debt provisions and write-offs have fallen. The
virtual break-up of the European exchange rate mechanism has both helped
ease asset quality problems, and boosted banks' trading profits.
British banks, whose problems were epitomised by the loss of Pounds 242m in
1992 recorded by the biggest bank Barclays, have started rebuilding capital
by retaining earnings in spite of continued weak demand for loans. They are
expected to keep increasing profits up to 1996 on a cyclical upswing.
German and Swiss banks have also reported sharply improved results. The most
remarkable recovery story has emerged in the past few months in Scandinavia.
Nordic banks such as SE-Banken have declared that they do not require
government support, and can instead raise fresh capital from rights issues.
Japanese banks are later in the cycle than European, and are still dealing
with asset problems from the aftermath of the 'bubble economy'. This has led
to a substantial retreat from international syndicated lending in which big
Japanese banks participated aggressively during the 1980s.
The strongest profits from traditional banking in the year have come from
Asia. A boom in Pacific Rim economies, together with the absence of strong
debt markets as an alternative to borrowing from banks, has created large
profits for banking groups such as HSBC Holdings.
But while the environment may be safer, it does not offer the strong lending
growth that has followed past recessions. This is partly because of risk
management controls to ensure they do not repeat mistakes, and partly
because demand is weak.
Improved risk management has become a fundamental concern for banks as they
try to allocate capital to the activities that not only appear to be
profitable, but make sufficient returns to offset credit losses during
downturns. This has led to re-examination of some lending activities.
Among the 'new tricks' to which Mr Pearse - whose bank was acquired by HSBC
Holdings last year - refers is the attempt to build earnings from
non-lending activities. For corporate banks, this means trading and advisory
work, and for retail banks it means selling insurance and savings.
Caution about lending is partly because banks do not want to lend again at
margins that do not reflect true risks. But it also stems from the desire to
conserve capital. Regulators and equity markets are both placing increasing
emphasis on banks having strong enough capital to absorb risk.
Mr Roberto Mendoza, a vice-chairman of JP Morgan, argues that banks
increasingly depend on strong capital to increase returns because it helps
attract business. 'Counter-intuitive though it may be, return on equity in
financial companies tends to rise the more capital you have,' he says. The
increased emphasis on returns on capital achieved from various businesses
has already led to banks retreating from ineffective overseas operations. It
is now placing strains on European 'universal' banks that have diverse
businesses. They may gradually be forced to concentrate on niche areas.
The need to maintain capital is particularly acute for corporate banks
because those without strong capital can in effect be barred from trading
instruments such as financial derivatives. Yet such trading is required to
raise profits because lending margins are too narrow alone.
'The low return from corporate lending is a big problem for commercial banks
with investment banking pretensions,' says Mr David Band, chief executive of
Barclays' securities arm BZW. But although there has been some revival in
syndicated loans, many companies have looked elsewhere for finance.
The surge in bond markets because of falling interest rates has stimulated
the trend towards the 'disintermediation' of corporate financial services.
Companies with better credit ratings than banks and fewer overheads can
raise money on capital markets more cheaply.
That trend is long-established, but banks' retail business is also being
undercut by consumer finance companies. US banks have competed successfully
in the buoyant mutual fund market this year, but consumers' increasing
access to credit and investments from other companies may squeeze banks.
These developments have led Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve,
to express concern about banks' future in the US financial system. The
boundary between banks and other companies offering financial services is
being weakened by banks' diversifications away from lending.
Yet the paradox is that such worries are being expressed at a time when
banks are as healthy as they have been for half a decade and shares have
been rallying. Decisions made in the next five years on how to use their
newfound capital will determine the patient's long-term health.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (8): An
unprecedented bull run - Bonds / The US and Japanese markets have proved
they can defy gravity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic slowdown which has cast a pall over OECD countries has had at
least one beneficiary: for the past three years, the world's bond markets
have enjoyed an unprecedented bull run, which has already outlasted most
analysts' expectations.
Bad economic news spells good news for bond markets because it encourages
governments to lower short-term interest rates, in turn forcing down bond
yields, in an effort to revive economic growth. At the same time, economic
recession drags down inflation, which means that real yields become more
attractive to investors and underpin the long end of the market.
The main reason for the continuing optimism over bond market performance is
that the outlook for inflation has changed dramatically. Traditionally, bond
markets have performed well during economic recession, and then weakened as
economic conditions improved.
That cycle may now have been broken. 'US bond yields are still falling, 10
quarters into a recovery, and conditions here (in Europe) are going to be
rougher if anything,' said Mr Phillip Saunders, fixed interest investment
director at Guinness Flight.
The UK has also officially emerged from recession, yet there are
expectations that not only long-term bond yields but also short-term
interest rates have somewhat further to fall.
'There has been a marked change in investment psychology,' said Mr George
Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg. 'There is always a cyclical
decline in inflation, which is usually short-lived. This time round, low
rates of inflation will persist.' He cites a number of factors, such as lack
of employment opportunities and competition from rapidly growing Asian
economies which will contribute to low inflation growth among developed
countries.
This has increased the scope for bond yields to fall, since low inflation
has enhanced real yields (yields with inflation stripped out).
Nevertheless, investors may not be keen to buy bonds at such historically
low yields. 'You can't draw forecasts with a ruler,' warned one fund
manager. 'We are in uncharted territory, and that makes everyone very
nervous.'
Investors are struggling to come to terms with the implications of lower
yields. Some investors, such as yield-hungry US insurance companies, take on
greater credit risk to enhance yields, for example by buying bonds issued by
Latin American borrowers, or by poorly-rated companies. More commonly,
investors have tended to extend the maturity of their bond investments, to
benefit from the steep yield curves created by cuts in short-term rates.
Initially, the US yield curve, for example, steepened dramatically because
of the speed with which the authorities cut rates.
More recently, however, there has been a flattening of the yield curve. In
part, this is because very low money market rates make it cheap to fund
positions at the longer end of the market.
For traders, a long position in German bonds has to outperform substantially
a long position in US bonds because the cost of funding the German bond
position is substantially higher. As a result, the longer end of the US
market has rallied, causing a flattening of the yield curve.
The same pattern has already been seen, albeit less dramatically in the UK
and is expected to follow in Europe.
Some analysts believe that investors will simply have to adjust their
expectations, since returns on stock as well as bond markets are likely to
fall short of the levels seen in the 1980s, as economic growth in OECD
countries is likely to remain low.
However, they point out that, in a historical context, real yields are not
particularly low.
In the US, for example, with inflation at 2.8 per cent, a 6 per cent long
bond yield offers a real yield of 3.2 per cent, which appears paltry
compared with the average real yield of 6.2 per cent in the 1980s, but looks
more favourable against a 2.6 per cent average in the 1960s and a 1.3 per
cent average in the 1970s.
Nevertheless, there is a growing sense that the US bond market rally cannot
have much further to go, and the conviction that at present levels the
market does not offer 'good value' relative to other markets.
The only problem is that analysts have been predicting the end of the US
Treasury market rally since at least the start of the year.
In Japan, although the lack of any sign of inflationary pressure will
continue to buoy the market, there is a sense any further rate cuts are well
discounted and the market will get little further lift from arriving at its
goal. Indeed, with 10-year yields at around 4 per cent, it is hard to argue
for further substantial yield declines.
Both markets have already proved they can defy gravity, and may well do so
again. Nevertheless most fund managers believe that European bond markets,
which are heading for some substantial cuts in rates, still offer the best
value, and are tending to adopt overweight positions in these markets.
Italian and Spanish bonds have benefited most dramatically from the
break-down of the ERM: Italian 10-year bond yields have already fallen from
12 1/4 per cent in June to 9 1/2 per cent in September.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (7): Hands-on
angels pick out the plums - Buzzwords explained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENTURE capital industry, like most others, has its jargon and its
technical terms which can confuse the outsider. In recent years, however,
the venturer's vocabulary has become more staid as the industry itself has
matured and now it increasingly reflects the world of corporate finance.
Some of the more colourful expressions which crossed the Atlantic along with
the techniques themselves in the 1970s have fallen out of use but a flavour
of venture capital's pioneering days remains.
Burn rate: the rate at which a business uses up the funds provided.
Business angel: private investor who not only finances small companies but
also gives them the benefit of his or her own expertise. Most angels are
retired executives or entrepreneurs who have sold their own business.
Business Expansion Scheme: a scheme to encourage investors to engage in risk
investment by offering them tax relief at their top marginal rate, for up to
Pounds 40,000 invested a year. There is now a Pounds 750,000 annual
investment limit for each investee company to channel investment to smaller
businesses. But recent cuts in tax rates have reduced the attractions of the
BES for investors, while special encouragement for investments in
residential property have diverted funds away from non-property ventures.
The Treasury's long-running dislike of the scheme finally carried the day in
the March 1992 budget and the BES will come to an end in December 1993.
Business plan: the document put together by managers to justify their
application to financiers for backing. This should contain summaries of past
and projected profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and cash flows. Also
details of products and services, markets, future strategy and profiles of
the managers. Don't get too carried away though. Most financiers will not go
beyond the two-page executive summary.
Captive funds: venture capital organisations which form part of larger
financial services groups. Usually they do not raise their own discrete
funds but draw on the resources of their parent groups.
Carried Interest: shares or an option on shares taken by the venture
capitalist in the investee company as part of the financing agreement.
Usually the stake taken is 20 per cent. See also Hurdles. Corporate
venturing: the practice of a large company taking a small equity stake or
establishing a joint venture with a smaller business to benefit from the
smaller firm's specialist expertise. The large firm can provide finance,
management back-up and distribution outlets which would not be available to
the smaller partner.
The small company brings its innovative skills and allows the big company a
ringside view of the new products and technologies it is developing.
Corporate venturing links can lead to the bigger partner acquiring the
smaller. Many US and some Continental companies have practised this
technique though it has failed to appeal to large British companies.
Deal Flow: the number of investment propositions which come to the venture
capitalist.
Development Capital: later stage venture capital invested after two or three
years when the business has become established and needs extra funds for
expansion. Most venture capitalists are in fact providing development
capital. The rewards are lower but the risks are correspondingly less than
for early stage investments.
Exit: the point at which the venture capitalist realises all or part of his
investment by either arranging a flotation of the company or, more commonly,
selling it to another company or trade buyer. A growing range of exits is
becoming available and the list also includes a refinancing of the company
by another group of venture capitalists or the purchase of all the shares by
the company's own management.
Hands on/hands off: some venture capitalists take a very close interest in
their investee companies and will provide management expertise to help them
get started and in times of difficulty. It is rare to find a venture
capitalists who does not claim to be hands on but many, in moments of
honesty, will admit to being hands off or passive investors.
Hurdle rates: institutional investors have grown restive at the fees venture
capitalists earn and have started to insist that funds achieve a basic
return before managers can claim their carried interest. They often set
hurdles based on a return on gilts or one of the leading stock market
indexes.
Independent funds: these do not form part of larger financial groups. They
raise their money from institutional and other investors.
Internal rate of return (IRR): different people calculate this in different
ways but it basically means the compound annual rate of return to the
investor. It includes dividend distributions and profits from disposals or
the profits shown on a fair valuation of an investee company. Inevitably
venture capitalists differ over when investments should be written down, up
or off so the figures are rarely strictly comparable.
Lemons and plums: bad investments invariably go wrong before the good ones
produce profits. The lemons usually ripen before the plums.
Living dead: a portfolio company which is just about trading profitably but
which shows little sign of ever meeting the venture capitalist's early high
expectations.
Management buy-in: the purchase of a business by an outside manager or team
of managers with the help of a group of financial backers.
Management buy-out: the purchase of a business by its existing management
with the help of a group of financial backers. Buy-outs are funded largely
by loans secured on the assets of the company itself. Most of the equity
comes from the venture capitalist or other financial backer. The management
puts up a small amount of finance for a disproportionately large percentage
of the equity.
Management fee: this is an annual charge normally amounting to 2 1/2 per
cent of the sum invested. Some investors have insisted that the larger funds
making later stage investments should charge less because their portfolio
companies are less time-consuming. Others argue the management fee should
decline as a fund matures and fewer new investments are being made.
Recovery or turnaround financing: supplied to companies in difficulties
where the venture capitalist sees an opportunity to beef up or change the
management and return the company to profits. Some venture capitalists have
employed insolvency specialists to identify and manage such investments.
Refinancing: can be a sign of either failure or success. If a company
performs poorly it may need an extra injection of funds. Equally, if it does
very well, the management may decide to refinance the business on terms more
favourable to themselves with their original venture capital backers or
sometimes a new team of financiers.
Replacement capital: funds provided to allow an existing shareholder to sell
some or all of his shares.
Second-round financing: venture capitalists rarely expect the first
injection of funds to meet a business's needs. A second or even a third
round of funding will almost certainly be needed later as the business grows
or unforeseen problems arise. At this stage the original venture capital
investor may reduce his holding and bring in others to spread the risk.
Seed Capital: usually quite small amounts of capital provided to turn a good
idea into a marketable product or service. The riskiest form of venture
capital since the concept, the technology, the entrepreneur and the market
are all unproven. For this reason seed capital has been in very short
supply. Some venture capitalists argue seed capital should not really be
necessary since most people should be able to raise say Pounds 25,000 from
savings or bank borrowings secured on their home.
Spin-out: a new company set up by a larger established group to exploit new
developments or fresh market opportunities and in which the management team
and a venture capital backer also take equity stakes.
Star: a company which is so successful that it pays for all the failures and
humdrum performers in the venture capitalist's portfolio.
Sweet equity: the extra percentage of a company's equity which is allocated
to the managers over and above the shareholding which their own relatively
modest financial investment would qualify them for. The extra shares are
seen as an additional motivation and reflect the fact that it is the
managers' hard work which will ultimately make the venture succeed.
Sometimes also referred to as sweat equity to reflect the hard work the
managers put in.
Trade sale: the sale of a company to a corporate buyer. This is the most
common exit route (qv) for venture capital backed companies.
Venture capital: equity finance provided usually to young, unquoted
businesses to enable them to get started or to expand. Equity funds provide
a basis for the company to raise further bank finance and provide a cheap
source of funds in the early stages of the business because dividends can be
delayed until the company starts making profits. Venture capitalists say
they bring not only money but also management and industrial expertise to
their investee companies. See 'Hands On' definition, on facing page.
Vulture capital: the derogatory term applied to an offer of funds or a deal
which gives the venture capitalist an unfairly large equity stake in a
company.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (6): More power to
capital markets - Investment institutions / The amount of money sloshing
around the world's financial system is so vast governments seem almost
powerless to resist it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABILITY of international capital markets to embarrass governments was
demonstrated in September 1992 and August 1993, when speculative attacks
twice caused turmoil in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The amount of money sloshing around the world's financial system is so vast
that governments seem almost powerless to resist it - they might as well
attempt to repeal the laws of gravity.
To give a few examples:
Net daily foreign exchange turnover last year was about Dollars 1,000bn,
compared with central bank reserves which were estimated at Dollars 555.6bn
in April 1992.
Turnover in the Eurobond market reached more than Dollars 7,000bn in 1992,
according to the International Securities Market Association.
The World Bank has estimated that global institutional investment funds are
worth Dollars 14,000bn.
In a report on capital flows, the International Monetary Fund stated that
cross-border equity holdings in the US, Europe and Japan increased from
Dollars 800bn in 1986 to Dollars 1,300bn in 1991.
Cross-border investment may have a lot more scope for growth. Restrictions
on foreign investment by domestic institutions - pension funds, insurance
companies, unit trusts or mutual funds and the like - are being eased round
the world. The relaxation of rules covering occupational pension plans in
Switzerland means that funds can now invest up to 25 per cent in foreign
stocks and up to 30 per cent in all investments denominated in foreign
currencies.
The US institutions are still well behind Europe in the extent of their
portfolio diversification. It is estimated that European institutions now
invest about 20 per cent of their assets overseas; in the US, the proportion
is only around 7 per cent.
A survey by Greenwich Associates found that Dollars 31bn was invested in
international stock markets by US pension funds in 1992. But corporate and
public pension funds planned to invest a further Dollars 100bn in foreign
stocks over the next five years.
Pension funds are, of course, only part of the US institutional investment
community. According to UBS Global Research, a record Dollars 26.6bn was
invested in foreign bonds and equities by US institutions in the first
quarter of 1993, compared with Dollars 17.4bn in the last quarter of 1992.
These funds are controlled by professional managers who are well aware of
the need to produce good performance to retain their management contracts.
They will thus be quick to exploit any profitable opportunities - such as an
expected currency devaluation - or to desert a stock market if they feel
government policy has moved in an uncongenial direction. Conversely,
domestic markets can surge if international fund managers decide to increase
their country allocation by a couple of percentage points or so.
A classic example of a country's economic policy being set with financial
markets in mind is that of France in the early 1990s, where interest rates
have been kept high to support the franc, in the face of the belief of many
economic commentators that substantial interest rate cuts were needed to
prevent a drastic recession.
Not only is cross-border investment likely to grow, but the funds available
for investment are also expected to increase. As the population of the
developed world ages, it will need to save more and more to provide for its
pensioners. By 2010, for example, around 18 per cent of the Japanese
population is expected to be 65 or older, compared with 11 per cent in 1990.
Pension fund assets are expected to grow from Y150,000bn in 1990 to
Y250,000bn by the year 2000, according to the Japanese Pension Fund
Association.
A further development is the readiness of many more economies to welcome the
influx of foreign capital. Financial liberalisation measures in Latin
America and south-east Asia have helped make 'emerging markets' investment
the flavour of the moment in the fund management industry.
The argument in favour of emerging markets is relatively simple. Their
economies are growing that much faster than those in the developed world,
and as they embrace capitalism, the prospects for growth in corporate
profits are that much greater.
Emerging markets still form only a tiny part of institutional portfolios,
but that in itself can be cited as a bullish argument. World Bank figures
suggest there are around 135 emerging markets - the countries concerned have
80 per cent of the world's population but just 12 per cent of its GDP and 6
per cent of its stock market capitalisation. As institutions increase
investments in the area, so the theory goes, the 'weight of money' will
boost share prices. Japan was once an emerging market, after all.
Certainly, money has started to flow into the emerging markets. In Latin
America, equity portfolio inflows increased from Pounds 435m in 1989 to
Dollars 5.6bn in 1992. A Micropal survey of emerging market investment
managers found that Mexico was the market of main choice, followed by
Malaysia, Brazil, Thailand and Hong Kong.
Individually, these markets may be volatile but collectively, fund managers
believe a diversified portfolio can offer enhanced rewards, since stock
market returns do not appear to be correlated - there would seem to be no
reason why the Malaysian market should move in the same direction as the
Brazilian.
Once such countries have become dependent on foreign capital, they may find
their economic policies constrained by the need to keep international
investors sweet. The power of international investment institutions will
have increased once more.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (5): Era of the
multinationals - Foreign direct investment / The development of
communications and a change in political climate is altering the face of
global manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECT investment by multinational corporations is becoming a hugely
important force in the world economy. A recent study from the United Nations
estimated that multinationals now control a third of the world's private
productive assets. Their stock of foreign investments is now worth Dollars
2,000bn. The turnover generated by these assets in 1992 was bigger than
total world exports. In other words, direct investment abroad is now a
bigger economic force than world trade.
Although investment worldwide has dropped sharply from its peak in 1990, it
seems likely that the upward trend will resume. As the UN report points out,
growth in foreign direct investment in the past couple of decades has
averaged 13 per cent a year. In the period 1986-90 the rate was 28 per cent.
That brief and unsustainable spurt was due partly to the economic boom of
the late 1980s, partly to one-off changes such as the introduction of the
European single market.
The underlying arguments for growth in foreign direct investment remain
unchanged. In essence, a combination of factors, such as the development of
global communications and a change in the political climate towards
multinationals, is bringing in an era of true global manufacturing.
A company such as Siemens, the German electronics giant, may now start
making a product in Germany, where precision and automation are required,
then ship it to Malaysia for the labour-intensive final stages of
manufacture. At the same time, much of its software research is undertaken
in India, which has an abundant supply of cheap computing talent.
Foreign direct investment is also proving an important force in the
integration of national economies. Ford is developing its 'world car', known
as the Mondeo in Europe and to be sold in North America next year as Ford
Contour and Mercury Mystique. Components such as engines and transmissions
for the car will be made at single locations and shipped worldwide.
In semiconductors, Siemens, IBM and Toshiba have formed an alliance to
develop the next generation of memory chip. The chip will be supplied to the
world market from a single factory, in a country yet to be determined.
As the UN report argues, such integration is also important at the regional
level. The strategy by Japanese companies of locating production in cheaper
Far Eastern countries such as Thailand and Malaysia has done much to
integrate the economies of the region. US companies were setting up
production in Mexico, for similar reasons, before negotiations on the North
American Free Trade Agreement had even started.
There is an important distinction to be made between the kind of integration
based on trade, which is relatively simple, and the far more complex links
involved in global manufacturing. The report says that 'as integration moves
from shallow trade-based linkages to deep international production-based
linkages under the common governance (of multinationals), the traditional
division between integration at the corporate and country levels begins to
break down'.
As a result, the multinationals 'encroach on areas over which sovereignty
and responsibilities have traditionally been reserved for national
governments. This raises new issues of direct concern to the formation of
national laws and regulations'.
Foreign direct investment tends to transfer assets from the developed world
to the developing world. But the pattern is not entirely simple. Last year,
of a total of Dollars 126bn in foreign direct investment worldwide, Dollars
40bn - 32 per cent - went to developing countries. This represents an
advance on the 26 per cent going to developing countries in the period
1981-85, but the change is not dramatic.
In part, this is accounted for by the fact that big shifts have occurred in
the composition of foreign direct investment by sector. Increasingly,
investment is going into services and high-tech manufacture, rather than
basic manufacture and natural resources. As might be expected, foreign
direct investment in the developed world is mostly in the former category,
whereas in the developing world the emphasis is on the latter. Increasingly,
it seems, countries have to reach a basic level of sophistication before
they can get in on the act.
This is borne out by the fact that last year, the Dollars 40bn of foreign
direct investment going to developing countries was spent almost wholly in
two regions: east, south and south-east Asia got Dollars 21bn, while Latin
America and the Caribbean got Dollars 16bn. The whole of Africa got a
pitiful Dollars 2bn, while the sum invested in the least developed countries
was too small to measure.
Changing this pattern may prove a long job. Simple cash incentives to set up
production in a country have little effect, other than on the margin. As any
international businessman will tell you, if that is the best reason for
going to a country you had better not go at all. In addition, the increasing
sophistication of global production means that cheap labour is often not a
deciding factor either.
What companies often look for is threefold: a skilled local workforce, good
infrastructure (especially telecommunications) and a welcoming attitude by
government. Acquiring the first two is a long haul. But at least, something
can be done about the third.
The dangers of antagonising international investors can be illustrated by
the case of an economy as sophisticated as that of South Korea which has a
real need for inward investment primarily as a means of getting hold of
technology. But a streak of xenophobia in the Korean character shades into
downright antagonism when it comes to their former colonial masters, the
Japanese. Korea traditionally has made things awkward for foreigners in
terms of its financial system, its real estate laws and so forth.
Last year, Korea saw a net outflow of foreign direct investment, a fact
which seems to have brought the government to its senses. A concerted
attempt is now being made to be nicer to foreigners.
Whether it will reverse the damage remains to be seen. Across the world, the
days when it paid to revile the multinationals are long gone. Like it or
not, too much depends on them.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (4): Start-up
prospects remain uncertain - The switch to later-stage investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST UK venture capitalists have lost money helping businesses to get
started and backing them in the early stages. Neither the 'portfolio'
approach, scattering money across a broad spread of new businesses in the
hope that some will succeed, nor more selective investments have paid off.
The result has been that in both the UK and continental Europe the venture
capital industry has progressively withdrawn from backing start-ups and
switched to later-stage investments. Backing new businesses is no less
time-consuming than backing established ones but the risks are much greater
and the time taken to generate profits much longer.
Nor has it proved possible to finance the odd start-up deal among an
otherwise later-stage portfolio. Dealing with start-ups is so different from
providing large amounts of development capital or funding management
buy-outs that many venture capital groups have abandoned early-stage deals
altogether.
In the UK, early-stage investments accounted for 17 per cent of deals by
number and seven per cent by value in 1992. In Europe as a whole, the
picture was similar: early-stage investments were 15 per cent of deals by
number and six per cent by value.
In Britain, companies such as JMI and Oxford Seedcorn Ventures, specialists
at the early stage end of investing, pulled out while even 3i, the largest
supporter of early-stage investments, has also sharply reduced its activity.
In the late 1980s, 3i was regularly backing more than 250 start-ups a year,
peaking at just over 300 in 1990. These numbers have since been reduced
sharply and in 1992 it backed only 58 'management start-ups.' They accounted
for just Pounds 15m out of total new investments of Pounds 310m although
start-up investments are almost invariably smaller than later stage deals.
'It is often a problem to find other people willing to back a start-up,'
says John Platt, a 3i director. 'It took us 18 months to put one deal
together.'
The nature of start-ups which win venture backing has also changed over the
years. Enthusiastic inventors with a good idea have fallen out of favour and
start-ups tend to be led by experienced managers.
'We don't back 'black box' start-ups,' says Mr James Nelson, managing
director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures. 'Generally we wouldn't back someone
with a product which was not selling. We would support managers with a good
idea and some acquisitions already identified.'
There have been several deals in the hotels and pubs sector where
experienced managers have obtained venture backing for the purchase of
properties from the large hotel chains or brewers. Such transactions have
more of the flavour of acquisition finance than start-ups as envisaged in
the early days of venture capital.
Start-up has also come to mean the extension of a formula, successful in one
country, into another country.
In one recent deal Apax Partners backed a 'start-up,' Xpedite Systems, a
York-based company providing sophisticated fax systems, with Pounds 3m. But
while Xpedite was a new company in the UK the British deal followed an
Dollars 8m dollar investment in Xpedite's US 'sister' company by Apax's US
office.
The picture for the more traditional start-up is not unrelievedly gloomy
however. In the technology field start-ups continue to be financed by
specialist funds. 'We back start-ups in the environmental area and will do
early-stage deals in the health care sector,' says Mr John Walker, senior
partner of Trinity Capital Partners. 'But you have to have a portfolio mix
which keeps your investors happy.'
A notable exception to the venture sector's inexorable move upscale has been
the cluster of seed capital funds managed by Lucius Cary, publisher of
Venture Capital Report, a monthly newsletter which attempts to match
investors with entrepreneurs seeking finance.
Mr Cary, a dogged supporter of the start-up sector, is raising his fifth
fund, Seed Investments IV, with a target size of Pounds 2m. This would be
his largest fund yet - the largest previously was Pounds 650,000. Two
pension funds have already promised to provide Pounds 1m towards the total.
The previous three Seed Investments funds were backed by Apax Partners. But
Mr Cary said they would not be contributing to the latest fund because of
the problem of incorporating very small investments into their larger scale
activities in mainstream venture capital.
The fifth fund will be large enough to allow follow up investments of up to
Pounds 200,000 if the initial Pounds 50,000 investment shows the business
has a future. Mr Cary says his previous funds have been successful because
he has concentrated on a specific type of investment.
He backs innovative entrepreneurs who have an idea or product involving
technology. Typically the first stage of investment will finance the
development of a prototype. The business must be based within easy reach of
Seed Investments' offices in Henley on Thames.
In the view of many venture capitalists, early-stage financings require a
degree of government support to become worthwhile. Attempts to persuade the
British government to put money directly into meeting the overheads of
early-stage funds have proved unsuccessful however.
The European Commission has shown itself more willing to put public money
into backing this sector. Over the past four years the commission has
sponsored the creation of 23 seed capital funds in Europe. These funds, with
18 established funds which have also joined the project, make up the
European Seed Capital Fund Network.
At the beginning of 1993 the network calculated that it had helped to create
126 businesses and more than 1,200 jobs. The 41 funds involved had a total
of Ecu265m under management.
The commission estimates that even if 30 per cent of the funds advanced have
to be written off, the costs in terms of creating businesses and jobs will
have been worthwhile.
More recently, a review of the network carried out for the commission found
that unless more money was provided the seed funds would run out of cash
before their investments started to produce a return. Many of the funds were
too small to be viable in the longer term, the report concluded.
Prospects for the start-up sector remain uncertain. Early, exaggerated
expectations of the venture capital industry's ability to finance them have
been abandoned. Bank loans and the entrepreneur's own savings seems set to
remain the main sources of finance.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (6): On the side
of the angels - Private investors can plug a persistent equity gap in small
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A GIANT game of hide and seek, with everyone blindfold
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that is how one expert describes the fitful courtship by small businesses of
business angels, the private investors sometimes prepared to invest equity
capital in small businesses.
This is a problem, because the wealthy private investors ('angels' is a
generic name borrowed from the Broadway slang for individuals interested in
backing promising show business in the US) could otherwise usefully plug a
persistent equity gap - the one that affects small businesses struggling to
attract smaller sums of capital.
This gap was first identified more than 60 years ago. It exists partly
because venture capitalists are generally not interested in investing less
than Pounds 250,000. They know it is cheaper to invest Pounds 1m as a lump
sum, rather than splitting the money into four different investment
decisions and quadrupling research costs.
Mr Colin Mason, senior lecturer in economic geography at Southampton
University and student of the activities of business angels in the UK, says:
'It is a problem for businesses which have exhausted their sources of
finance but are in too small a league to go to venture capitalists.'
Small wonder that people running small businesses are prone to visions of
wealthy private individuals appearing with wads of cash and common sense, to
perform miracles with their companies. The grander vision is that of hosts
(syndicates) of angels with bigger wads, led by an archangel.
A RECENT study by Mr Mason and his colleague at the Ulster Business School,
Professor Richard Harrison, found that the kind of people who become angels
range from big company managers who have retired with golden handshakes, to
small businessmen who have sold out but are looking around for a second
business to help build up.
Most are well-off but not millionaires. The average income of the 86 angels
surveyed was just under Pounds 50,000. Almost 45 per cent earned between
Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 49,000; 16 per cent earned Pounds 100,000 or more.
Small businesses know that angels are out there. They account for a sizeable
amount of small business investment in the US and their presence is
increasingly felt in the UK.
The trouble is they do not like to advertise. As Mr Mason says: 'They want
anonymity. No one with a spare million quid is going to advertise the fact.
They'd be inundated.'
For most business angels, investing in a small business is a spare time
activity. Researching those investments is time consuming, so most potential
angels rely on friends or informal contacts to find opportunities.
What is needed, says Mr Mason, is 'a lonely hearts dating agency which will
bring small businesses and business angels together.'
In the private sector, this has been tried. It has failed to make money for
the operators. The economics simply do not stack up; the costs of marketing,
research and guidance always outweigh the income from introductions. Mr
Mason says: 'There is a need for somebody to underwrite the costs.'
Awareness of the problem is now widespread. Solutions are being piloted in
both the public and private sector, forming part of various plans to help
small businesses.
The UK department of employment made its move in October 1991, as part of 'a
seven-point plan to help small firms and enterprise.'
Mr Michael Howard, the then employment secretary, announced a programme to
support 'business introductions.'
At the time he described it as 'a measure to tackle the difficulties which
some small firms find in arranging investment capital.' It involved 'a
programme under which local Training and Enterprise Councils and a network
of other organisations will work as 'marriage brokers' bringing together
investors with money and small firms with potential.'
Following a competition, projects were established in Bedfordshire,
Calderdale and Kirklees, Devon and Cornwall, East Lancashire and south and
east Cheshire. Mr Howard added: 'This will encourage the growth in this
country of informal investment, which is widespread and highly successful in
the United States.'
IN the US, angels are eager to fund fast-growing companies. Local lawyers
and accountants act as introduction agents - some estimates suggest that
angels are now the biggest single source of investment capital in the
country. Many belong to private clubs, of which some have offshoot angel
chapters in cities across the US. As in the UK, club members tend to be
former or current executives looking for money-spinning opportunities.
In the UK, Mr Howard's move is consistent with the thrust of current small
business policy, which is to encourage partnerships between large and small
businesses, between business support networks (TECS, Enterprise Agencies,
Chambers of Commerce) and small firms, as well as between academic
institutions and firms.
This follows the trend away from grant funding for small business
development; for example, the government's Loan Guarantee Scheme is under
government review and looks likely to be phased out.
Moreover, following an announcement in the March 1992 Budget, the Business
Expansion Scheme (which provides tax incentives to investors in small
businesses) will be terminated at the end of 1993. This is sure to please Mr
Howard Davies, director-general of Britain's Confederation of British
Industry (CBI), the employers' organisation.
Earlier this year he criticised the BES for acting as a 'middle-class tax
shelter'. As part of a six-point plan for small business finance he called
for a replacement to the BES which would apply only to investment in a new
type of local investment company, through which small business angels could
take stakes in targeted ventures.
This summer National Westminster bank (NatWest) launched a feasibility study
to see if a national database of angels could be set up. The bank is
carrying out a pilot study in the north-west of England and the Thames
valley, examining how much time and money investors would be prepared to
commit to small firms.
A recent survey by staff at the Ulster Business School, who also have their
own six-point plan for spotting angels, found that business angels are
'hands-on investors'.
Angels want to protect their investment, but they are also looking for a
'buzz factor'. This means that a small business can benefit from the
experience and skills of its backer, but it may also have to tolerate a
certain amount of bossing about.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (5): Stock market
rediscovers venture-backed companies - Listings have returned to favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENTURE capitalists can hardly believe their good fortune. After a long
period of famine, stock market investors have rediscovered an interest in
venture-backed companies. Most of the companies that obtained a listing on
the London stock exchange in the first six months of 1993 had been funded by
the venture capital industry.
Paradoxically, this upsurge of activity occurred when the stock exchange
appeared to be signalling less interest in the smaller company. The stock
exchange is thinking of closing the unlisted securities market, intended to
cater for the younger company.
European Community legislation had led to the main market becoming more
accessible to smaller companies and the USM had fallen out of favour with
market makers and companies alike. But its closure, many felt, might force
some would-be entrants to delay a listing. Venture capitalists and other
City interests are still trying to devise an alternative mechanism for
helping smaller companies to market.
The maturing of the venture capital industry which has also meant that many
10-year funds are approaching the end of their natural lives. There is now
pressure on many venture capitalists to realise their investments and
dispose of the rumps of their portfolios.
Listings have returned to favour after a long period when trade sales
dominated the 'exit' scene. Larger companies seeking to expand into a new
market niche or add on a complementary product line could usually offer more
than a company could raise by flotation.
This situation has been reversed in recent months. At the end of a
recession, trade buyers are thinner on the ground and the stock market has
offered attractive prices. 'Smaller stock market companies are expected to
show above-average growth over the next few years,' says Mr Ron Hollidge,
managing director of Lloyds Development Capital. 'The picture for exits has
dramatically improved. There has been a strong reversal of the exit pattern
in favour of floats.'
CINVen, which invests on behalf of the pension funds of British Coal,
British Rail and Barclays Bank, completed six sizeable flotations in the
first six months of the year compared with only two trade sales.
Field Group, a packaging company, was capitalised at Pounds 148m when it
floated in June, with CINVen's original Pounds 20m investment tripling in
just two years. RPC Group, another packaging concern, delivered a five-fold
increase in CINVen's original Pounds 8m investment, also in just two years.
NatWest Ventures, for its part, managed to float five of its portfolio
companies in the first half of 1993, including Holliday Chemical Holdings, a
dyestuffs manufacturer valued at Pounds 161m, and Carpetright, a retail
chain headed by Sir Phil Harris, valued at Pounds 113m.
A feature of these flotations was the size of the companies involved.
Investors are now prepared to wait before taking a company to market after a
bad experience with some of the smaller flotations of the late 1980s. The
listing boom also reflects the coming of age of buy-outs staged in the late
1980s/early 1990s. All but one of CINVen's listings were originally
buy-outs, as was the case with NatWest Ventures.
AN important attraction of a float is that these companies have been able to
achieve very high price/earnings ratios, typically around 17 or 18.
Expectations that smaller companies will outperform large ones have meant
that investors have been keen to get such companies on to their books. The
attraction to the managements of the companies themselves is that they can
retain their independence, often lost in a trade sale, and share in the
continued growth of their businesses.
Despite its plans to close the USM, the stock exchange has at the same time
made it easier for very small science-based companies to come to market.
These companies must already have an outside investor and must use the
listing to raise additional finance. They must also have a reasonable
prospect of making money for investors.
This has led to a raft of small bio-technology companies obtaining a
listing. Founding shareholders are not allowed to sell their shares for the
first two years but they do have the benefit of an independent valuation of
their business.
Welcome though this development is to both entrepreneurs and their venture
capital backers, some observers have concerns about the experiment. 'The
stock exchange made a good move by letting in these small companies but
there is a lack of good quality technical commentary and analysis,' says Mr
John Walker, senior partner of Trinity Capital Partners, which makes
technology investments for Charterhouse, Alex Brown &amp; Sons and 3i.
Mr Walker points to the problem of putting a valuation on some of the
smaller technology companies where their main asset is the value of their
research.
Efforts to make the London stock exchange more accessible to the sort of
company backed by venture capital cannot disguise the difficulties young
companies encounter on a public stock market.
Not only USM companies but many of the smaller companies on the main board
in London experienced investor neglect once they were listed. Few analysts
have been prepared to follow the smaller stocks and there has been little
liquidity in their shares. The clutch of new arrivals who have gone to
market in recent months will be hoping that they do not suffer the same
fate.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (2): Weaker
players at risk - Charles Batchelor fears the shake-out may claim more
victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The steady contraction of the UK venture capital industry appears to have
slowed over the past 12 months. But the present pause, far from marking the
end of the shake-out of weaker players, may be merely the lull before the
storm.
There are no signs that UK institutions are more willing to increase their
investments in the short term and overseas investors have been almost as
reluctant to provide funds. At one stage this year no fewer than 40 UK
venture firms were looking to raise new finance.
Some venture capitalists are attempting to attract private individuals as
investors in their funds but this can be time consuming and can lead to
complicated fund structures.
'The big crunch will come in the next 12 to 24 months when people have been
unable to raise more money,' says Mr James Nelson, managing director of
Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures.
'Will investors be willing to commit their funds to the smaller teams of
venture capitalists for the next few years?'
Mr Nelson does not believe there will be a large contraction in the amount
of money available for the industry to invest - though the pool of finance
available has already shrunk markedly from the position in the late 1980s.
But he does think it will be spread among a smaller number of venture funds.
This gloomy view of prospects for the industry's less successful players is
shared by Mr Jonny Maxwell, in charge of unquoted investments for Standard
Life Assurance Company.
'There will be a great contraction in the industry with only five or six
managers capable of closing a serious fund,' he says.
Opinions differ in the venture industry as to who will feature in the big
league but among the most frequently mentioned names are CINVen,
Charterhouse, Phildrew Ventures, Candover Investments, Morgan Grenfell
Development Capital and Schroder Ventures. These all specialise in the
larger development capital deals and management buy-outs/buy-ins.
The general industry assumption that the 'captive' funds owned by the large
banks had a guaranteed future has been somewhat shaken by the decision of
one or two of the big banks to withdraw.
TSB Group's decision to sell Hill Samuel Development Capital - its portfolio
is being wound down by F&amp;C Ventures - showed venture/development capital was
not central to all the banks' activities.
But Mr Ron Hollidge, managing director of Lloyds Development Capital and
chairman of the British Venture Capital Association, believes the banks will
generally want to continue their development capital activities.
'I don't see the UK clearing banks pulling out,' he says.
'They recognise the need for expertise in structuring deals involving equity
to help companies recover from the recession.' Support for this view comes
from the decision of the Royal Bank of Scotland to recruit a former senior
3i executive to head a department aimed at using equity in just this way.
But while the banks may want to continue their involvement in development
capital they may not all want to do it in quite the same way as in the past.
Two foreign banks with UK-based venture operations have recently established
looser links with their development capital operations.
In July, Citicorp spun off its European venture capital activities into an
independent company, CVC Venture Partners, which is fully-owned by the US
bank's existing European venture management team. Citicorp will continue to
provide funds to CVC Venture Partners but the venture activities will be
free of the restrictions of US banking laws.
One advantage of creating independent venture capital operations is that
remuneration packages no longer have to fit within the usual banking
procedures.
There may be only a handful of very large players left in the venture
capital market by the end of the decade but there will also be a place for
the niche players. Several long-established venture teams have reputations
for backing companies with a technology bias in fields such as healthcare,
bio-technology and information technology.
Advent has specialised in medical instruments, diagnostics and software and
is raising a life sciences fund.
'We don't back start-ups but we do invest in companies which have a product
and which need to break into more than one country at once,' says Sir David
Cooksey, chairman.
These specialist players are sometimes introduced to deals by the larger
venture groups which lack expertise in that particular area. But sometimes
the larger players establish more permanent relationships to make these
specialised investments.
Trinity Capital is one, making investments in the healthcare, environmental
and information technology fields for its three backers, 3i, Charterhouse
and Alex. Brown, a US investment bank.
For much of the 1980s the venture capital industry was based largely in
London and the south-east but in recent years it has achieved a better
spread across other regions. This shift towards making more investments in
the regions is expected to continue over the next few years, according to a
recent review by accountants Arthur Andersen.
Midland Bank has contributed to this greater regional diversity with the
launch of a series of regional funds. Midland planned to launch 11 funds
with a total of Pounds 55m to invest, most of it raised from local
investors.
After a slow start, because of the problem of finding backers in the depths
of the recession, this regional network is now coming together.
These developments have challenged the once dominant position of 3i,
Britain's largest venture capital company, in the regions though 3i still
has a more extensive network of offices than any of its rivals.
The past year has not been happy for 3i. It went through a painful slimming
process to counter the recession and to prepare for a stock market flotation
but the listing plans were postponed indefinitely in April. As a result 3i's
chairman left.
Despite these setbacks 3i says it has sufficient resources to finance a
revival of UK business at the end of the recession. At the same time it is
looking to raise outside funds, for the first time, to finance an expansion
of its continental European activities.
For all the pressures of the past three years, the UK venture capital
industry still retains a remarkable diversity. The casualties of any further
retrenchment will be those funds which have either failed to establish a
good performance record or a strong profile.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (3): Pressures
rise for a rethink as returns fail to satisfy - Investors' viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in venture capital have put increasing pressure on fund managers
over the past few years to deliver better value for money. The pension
funds, insurance companies and 'gatekeepers' have sought performance
'hurdles' before the managers take their profit and a lowering of management
fees.
In many instances the venture capitalists have responded to these requests
while the industry has also begun working on a system of valuation and
performance measures. But, if the venture capitalists thought that this
would be enough to satisfy their critics they may be sadly disappointed.
There is every sign that investors are still not happy with the returns on
their money. They are pushing for an even more fundamental rethink of the
way the industry is structured. It will take more than the ending of the UK
recession to persuade the institutions to devote more funds to venture
capital.
'What has changed is the way we look at venture capital funds,' says Mrs
Carol Ames, director of Eagle Star Investment Managers.
'The high fees of the US venture capital industry were transferred to the UK
without taking account of the fact that the US has a larger economy, a
bigger venture capital market and more of a focus on start-ups.'
The generous management fees - typically 2 to 2 1/2 per cent of funds
invested - meant there was less of an incentive for UK venture managers to
maximise the value of their investments and earn their 20 per cent share of
profits or 'carry' by selling or floating their portfolio companies,
comments Mrs Ames.
At the same time, as funds grew larger, the management fees came to
represent substantial sums of money. Investors have put on pressure for
management fees to taper off as the funds get larger. Above Pounds 200m
managers might only earn 1-1 1/4 to 1-1 1/2 per cent in fees. 'There is less
ignorance now about economies of scale,' says Mr Jonny Maxwell, in charge of
unquoted investments at Standard Life Assurance.
Institutions were sometimes so naive in the early days of venture capital
that they are now reluctant to re-examine the terms of those early deals
because of the embarrassment it would cause.
'Deals were done on a hand shake,' recalls Mr Maxwell. 'It amounted to
saying: 'We will send you vast amounts of money for a big fee and you will
do your best to get a venture capital return.''
Investors have now become more sophisticated in structuring deals, as is
evidenced by the innovative arrangements being proposed by certain funds.
Baronsmead will allow investors to withdraw their funds at short notice and
have a say in the companies in which it invests, while Legal &amp; General
Ventures has announced plans for a series of rolling funds which return
uninvested amounts to the institutions at the end of the year.
MANY investors are unhappy with the traditional 10-year partnerships which
have become the norm in the UK. They tie up the investors' money for a long
period and give the institution little opportunity to influence investment
policy or withdraw if things go wrong. The investor has no guarantee that
the managers he backs in year one will still be there 10 or even five years
later.
'Institutions want to be able to change their asset allocation more easily
so they can time their own cash flows,' says Mrs Ames. 'They want a
structure which allows them to commit their funds for less than 10 years and
would like a choice of investments too.'
But opinion is divided over the question of 10-year funds. There are some
signs of a shift away from the partnership structure towards venture capital
companies which would have an unlimited life. This might have the virtue of
freeing the venture capitalists from the unnatural constraints of a 10-year
deadline but, in the view of some investors, would remove any pressure on
the fund managers to realise their investments.
'The 10-year deadline does impose a discipline otherwise managers would just
sit on their investments drawing their fees,' comments Mr Rhoddy Swire,
managing director of Pantheon Holdings, which invests in venture funds for
its institutional clients.
The institutions are not only determined that future investments should be
made on a more equitable basis. They are keen for existing investments to be
more accurately valued. To this end the British Venture Capital Association
(BVCA) introduced a set of valuation guidelines at the beginning of 1991.
Welcome though the guidelines were they have not dispelled the unease of
investors and have recently been revised to make them more effective.
'A rule is only as good as its implementation,' says Mr Swire, who is
concerned that venture capitalists might be distracted from their main
business by the need to devote time to the issue of valuations.
'I would rather people stuck precisely to what they say is the basis of
their valuations,' he says. He does not accept at face a value claims that a
fund conforms to the BVCA guidelines.
Mrs Ames shares this scepticism. 'People sometimes claim they meet the
guidelines when they don't and they always have good reasons for not meeting
the rules,' she says. 'The guidelines need to be more precise and there
needs to be some enforcement. I think the venture industry is becoming aware
of this and it will slowly get better.'
At the moment though, when fund-raising is so difficult and venture
capitalists are under extreme pressure to make their investment returns look
good, absolute honesty can penalise a fund when others are less scrupulous.
A frequent complaint which the venture capital industry makes against the
institutions is that they seek to impose short-term performance measures on
an industry which is long-term in its investments. 'Your returns drop after
you have made heavy investments,' says Mr Robin Hall, managing director of
CINVen, which manages funds for the pension funds of British Coal, British
Rail and Barclays Bank. 'It is either feast or famine.'
Enlightened investors are ready to acknowledge the constraints under which
venture fund managers have to work. But it looks as though it will be some
time before the industry has regained investors' confidence sufficiently to
justify them committing substantial new funds to the sector.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (2): Investors flex
their muscles - Financial markets / Hard-pressed governments, lured by the
attractions of global money, may find that the political price is
embarrassingly high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WITHIN THE past few weeks a number of governments of member states of the
European Community have experienced the power of today's free-wheeling
global capital markets. The European Monetary System has effectively
collapsed and several governments have had to abandon pledges on exchange
rates.
Global money is attractive but dangerous. On the one hand, the international
capital market has offered hard-pressed governments an attractive
opportunity to raise capital. It might, for instance, have been much harder
for countries such as France, the UK and Spain to sustain large budget
deficits without the ability to sell bonds in large volumes to international
investors.
On the other hand, the global investors impose a price. If a country's
economic policies are not attractive to them they will attack first the
short-term financial markets, with pressure on the currency, and second they
will withdraw support from government bonds.
For developed countries these constraints can be politically embarrassing
but by no means fatal. But in the third world the choices are often harsher.
Many governments of developing countries have in fact regarded the global
capital market as no more than an unacceptable arm of economic imperialism.
But in cutting themselves off to secure political independence they have
often condemned themselves to the economic backwaters.
Now, many developing countries are at last embracing the dangerous
opportunities offered by international capital. In terms of equities, large
volumes of money are flowing into so-called 'emerging markets' and even
certain third world debt securities, for instance in South America, are
finding international takers.
There may be a very long-term cycle to all this. Global capital flowed
freely across borders in the 19th century, when the City of London was
financing railroads in North America, mines in Africa and ranches in
Argentina. The risks turned out to be fairly high. Investors in South
American bonds, for instance, were usually the victims of default - a lesson
which banks relearned in the 1970s.
By the time of the first world war the barriers were going up, and episodes
of hyperinflation and depression in the inter-war period had a negative
effect. When the second world war followed, cross-border flows were almost
completely snuffed out, and most international assets of European countries
had to be sold to meet war debts, or were forfeited.
For a long time afterwards a capital-starved Europe hoarded its resources
behind a system of controls on capital movements. But these were steadily
dismantled, especially in the 1980s, as more liberal philosophies became
dominant.
Moreover, the opportunities for investment in Europe have diminished as the
economic growth rate has slowed. As in the 19th century, the best
opportunities for high returns are seen to be in the developing world,
probably in the east rather than in the west.
How big is the international capital market? There are various ways of
measuring it, but a recent research paper from the London securities house
NatWest Markets starts from the proposition that the total resources of the
international financial institutions are of the order of Dollars 14,000bn.
Of these institutions the most important are those in the US, Japan and the
UK. The degree of international diversification varies substantially, from
25 per cent for UK pension funds to about 5 per cent for their US
counterparts.
UK funds are not changing their allocations much at present, and the US
funds are at the centre of the stage. They are rapidly increasing their
overseas investments, which on some expectations will eventually rise to the
10-12 per cent range. According to the US consultants InterSec Research the
value of US tax-exempt assets with international mandates rose from Dollars
154bn to nearly Dollars 200bn in the first half of 1993.
Certainly, big flows are now being seen. The latest available figures, for
the first quarter of 1993, show that American investors poured Dollars 22bn
into overseas bonds and some Dollars 6bn into foreign equities, with an
emphasis on Europe. On the other hand, Japanese institutions have been
fairly quiet recently, whereas in the late 1980s they became huge buyers of
international bonds, especially US Treasury securities.
There are three strands to this cross-border activity. The dominant
motivation is a search for geographical diversification in developed
countries, with global portfolio managers seeking a balanced exposure to the
US, Europe and Japan.
Second, there is the desire for investors in mature economies to seek higher
returns, albeit with more risk, in faster-growing areas. The movements of
funds are comparatively small as a proportion of global cross-border flows,
but in absolute terms, in the context of individual third world markets, the
sums can loom large.
In the first quarter of this year US bond investors put almost Dollars 800m
net into Mexico, for instance. As for equities, US funds allocated some
Dollars 900m to the Hong Kong stock market in the three-month period, and
were also net investors in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea to the extent
of Dollars 200m or Dollars 300m in each case. Hong Kong now has a market
capitalisation of about 1.6 per cent of the FT-Actuaries World Index.
Retail investors are also being drawn into so-called emerging markets funds
which are being launched by more and more institutions - with a new one in
the UK from Mercury Asset Management last month, for instance.
Such funds tend to emphasise the high growth rates of parts of the
developing world. The MAM launch publicity quoted IMF forecasts that
economic growth in the emerging markets will reach 6 per cent over the
coming five years compared with a mere 2 1/2 per cent in the developed
world.
The third motivation for cross-border flows relates to tax or politics. For
instance, a few years ago Japanese life assurance companies were being urged
to buy vast quantities of US bonds to offset US-Japanese trade imbalances. A
current example is the big flow of German retail savings into Luxembourg to
escape withholding tax. Such flows can be substantial for a time, but
usually prove temporary.
For the time being, the tide remains strongly in favour of
internationalisation of the capital markets.
The message that capital can be better employed elsewhere is not one
governments like to hear. Similarly, the ability of the free-wheeling
markets to impose their judgments on the politicians can be resented. But
the politicians are on the defensive and global investors have gained the
upper hand.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (4): Down, but
possibly not out - Inflation / Inflationary pressures are subdued across the
developed world, but do not be fooled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF

<TEXT>
IS INFLATION a problem of the past? 'Yes' is the answer given by the new
conventional wisdom. It may be true for the moment. It may even be true for
the next few years. It is too early to be confident it will be true for
good.
Ever since the collapse of the gold standard, money has been subject to the
discretionary management of the state, which has discharged this trust with
remarkable incompetence or, worse, dishonesty. Consumer price indices show,
for example, that the purchasing power of a 1933 pound had fallen to 3p by
1993, while that of the dollar had fallen to 9 cents.
This great inflation began in the second world war and reached its peak in
the 1970s. In 1974 and again in 1980 the annual rate of inflation in OECD
countries peaked at between 13 and 14 per cent. The most recent cyclical
peak in OECD inflation, however, which occurred in 1990, was only 5.8 per
cent. This does not mean inflation is over, but it does show it has at least
become considerably less rapid than it had earlier been. This decline in
inflation has been general in OECD countries, one reason being that the
1980s did not see a repetition of the oil price shocks that coincided with
the peak inflation rates in the 1970s.
Yet, given last year's rate of about 4 per cent, it is impossible to argue
that inflation in the industrial countries is definitively dead. Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has argued that 'price stability
means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and
gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household
decisions'. Given the difficulty of measuring quality improvements, this
level is often taken to be 0-2 per cent. Some leading OECD countries have
already achieved that, if in the depths of recession. But others - not only
the US, Italy and the UK, but even Germany - have not, or at least not yet.
Even if inflation is not conquered, it is at least lower than for decades.
One question is why this has happened. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon.
There is no better explanation for it than that of 'too much money chasing
too few goods'. The proximate cause of current relatively low rates of
inflation, by the standards of the 1950s and 1960s, has been relatively
disciplined monetary policy and, in an era of high real interest rates,
greater willingness of investors to hold money in idle balances, rather than
spend it.
These monetary roots of current low inflation also give cause for optimism
about inflation in the medium term. In a modern economy money is created
less by governments than by banks. So weakened and frightened have banks
become by their mistakes in the 1980s that they are not prepared to expand
their balance sheets. This is now evident in countries as varied as the US,
Japan, the UK and Australia as well as those of Scandinavia. At present, in
fact, the only leading country worried by how rapidly broad money is growing
is, amazingly, Germany.
Another reason for optimism, it is argued, is the emergence of new low cost
competition, particularly in east Asia. This development is similar in its
effects to an increase in the rate of domestic productivity growth and
should reduce inflation if other things remain equal. But inflation can
still accelerate if the rate of increase in domestic nominal costs,
particularly wages, accelerates. Domestic monetary conditions are what
determine that.
Given current monetary conditions, the medium term chances of continued
modest inflation look good in almost all leading industrial countries. But
what about the longer term? In the end, after all, economies will recover,
banks will restore their capital base and borrowers will regain their
courage. The monetary policies that cause inflation reflect political
forces. Whether or not inflation will remain low depends ultimately on
whether it has ceased to be convenient for governments.
People go to jail for using fraudulent weights and measures. Governments try
to buy elections by doing the same thing - undermining the value of the
currency by printing more. The reason they do so is that while some voters
lose, many benefit from the extra tax revenue that the fraud produces:
unanticipated inflation is a way of achieving covertly what governments
could not have legislated overtly. But this 'inflation tax' works only when
inflation is unanticipated, and a given rate of inflation is unlikely to
remain unanticipated forever. So the 'tax' works if the government continues
to push inflation higher than people were expecting.
In the 1950s and 1960s, unanticipated inflation was a part of the mechanism
that delivered on the political commitment to 'full employment'. But the
commodity price increases of the 1970s brought this process - and the
commitment to full employment - to an end, since no politically acceptable
level of inflation could secure the required reduction in real wages.
A cogent argument for optimism about the long-term rate of inflation is that
the benefits of inflation to policymakers are now much smaller than in the
1960s and 1970s, its victims are better able to protect themselves and its
beneficiaries are also politically weaker. Meanwhile, potential victims
either lend short or demand high long-term nominal interest rates in
relation to current inflation. Policymakers know they are permanently on
trial and, lacking exchange controls, face immediate penalties if they are
condemned.
Nevertheless, there are also four good reasons for fearing that high
inflation might be politically attractive one day. First, managed money has
never delivered stable prices, or even stable low inflation, over any long
period. Second, each year of relatively modest inflation lulls the public
further, thereby increasing the redistributive effects of another burst of
inflation. Given the UK's current rate of issuance of long-term gilts with
coupons of 7 per cent, for example, higher inflation might well become
attractive once more, as the year 2000 approaches.
Third, there are plenty of debtors who would adore higher prices. Finally,
among those debtors are almost all leading governments, whose accounts are
bleeding red ink. The abolition of exchange controls may make it costly for
a country to choose inflation on its own. But there is always the
alternative of global inflation, euphemistically labelled 'concerted
reflation'. Buyers of long-dated conventional bonds should remember and
beware.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (3): In retreat
almost everywhere - Public sector / State-owned companies worth more than
Dollars 300bn have been sold by some 50 countries since 1985. Barry Riley
reviews the trend towards privatisation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT SEEMS very strange now in this triumphant era of privatisation, but some
50 years ago governments were eagerly nationalising important industries to
ensure that the failures of capitalism in the 1930s would not be repeated.
As recently as the early 1980s the French socialists were still
nationalising substantial concerns. Public ownership would safeguard the
public interest, they claimed.
Meanwhile, third world governments for much of the postwar era have seen the
expropriation of the assets of multinational companies as a natural
expression of their desire to assert economic as well as political
independence. Such policies were especially rife during the 1960s and the
early 1970s.
For a long while the Soviet Union and its many satellites provided a model
for the nationalisers to follow: the model was flawed, of course, but at
least it appeared to provide a viable alternative to western capitalism.
Today, however, the public sector is in retreat almost everywhere. The
Economist recently calculated that state-owned companies worth more than
Dollars 300bn have been sold off by some 50 countries since 1985. At least
as much further privatisation is likely to take place by 2000.
It is happening all around the globe. Although the UK, which pioneered the
process, has more or less reached the end of its 'sell' list, other western
European countries such as France and Italy have huge offerings on the
stocks.
France, for instance, with a new conservative government in charge, has
lined up the leading bank BNP as its first candidate, to be sold within a
few weeks, and the French Treasury hopes to receive upwards of Dollars 5bn
for the government's 73 per cent stake. In fact, France has effectively
raised Dollars 19bn in advance by selling 'Balladur bonds' which can be
converted into future privatisation stocks.
In eastern Europe the sums involved are comparatively tiny but the
implications are much more profound. Remarkable strides are being made in
privatising great chunks of the economies through a variety of methods
including voucher schemes, mutual funds, management takeovers and sales to
foreigners.
Latin America has become another highly active centre of privatisation. A
bandwagon set in motion by Chile has been jumped on by Argentina, Peru,
Colombia, Venezuela and others. The aim is to attract not only the US
portfolio money which has been pouring into South America but also the local
funk money which is being tempted back from overseas havens by more
financially liberal regimes.
The privatised assets tend to fall into a limited number of categories. For
instance, according to the investment bank Morgan Stanley 15 national
telephone companies have been privatised since 1981 and another 30 are
likely to be floated within the next three years. Oddly, though, France
Telecom is not yet officially on the list.
Three clearly distinct motives are present in the global wave of
privatisations. There is a simple desire to raise revenues, at a time when
government coffers are often bare. The OECD expects that government fiscal
deficits in Europe will top 6 per cent of GDP on average in 1993, because of
the recession.
Issues running at some Dollars 70bn a year will significantly offset these
revenue and spending imbalances. But there is a more direct economic motive,
to lift the deadening influence of public control and allow the dynamism of
private ownership to boost economic growth rates.
This search for a capitalist solution is evident in some of the developing
countries where there is now a much greater openness to investment by
multinationals, which are seen to be capable of bringing in capital and
technology.
Sometimes these two motives are directly in conflict, as when state-owned
monopolies are privatised. They would be worth more to a buyer if the
monopoly were retained, but selling off a licence to print money would
scarcely serve the objective of creating a competitive economy. Either the
monopoly must be split to create several competitors or a regulatory body
must be created to control the monopoly in the public interest.
Tricky labour market issues can also be highlighted by the process of
privatisation. Often, in the past, an overt purpose of nationalisation and
state ownership has been to safeguard jobs. Therefore it is common to find
that new capitalist managers can find enormous scope for job-shedding.
This has been strongly evident in the UK, for instance, where British
Telecom and the electricity generators have sharply reduced their workforces
(although in BT's case changing technology may have played an important
part).
Probably the worst political furore in the UK came in the wake of the
privatisation of the electricity industry, for rather indirect reasons: the
decision of the electricity bosses, newly freed from political constraints,
to cut back on coal burning has had devasting knock-on implications for the
coal mining industry.
The third important motive is to remove important industries from the
constraints of state funding. Where attractive investment opportunities
exist it can be damaging to the national economy if capital is withheld for
budgetary reasons. Released into the private sector, companies can raise
capital subject only to their ability to persuade investors that the terms
are attractive.
But does privatisation work? There is plenty of evidence of success for the
big western privatisations, but the battle is not entirely won in the
developing countries.
China is, of course, a puzzle all of its own, with a communist government
struggling to keep control of a burgeoning private sector. The Chinese
economy is paradoxically performing much better than that of Russia, where
the attempt to expand the private sector is apparently much more
enthusiastic and coherent, but where some important ingredients, such as a
flair for business, are presumably in short supply.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (1): A rethink on
performance measures - Poor returns are prompting radical reforms in the
venture capital industry, reports Charles Batchelor. The accepted practices
by which the industry has lived for the past decade are now being challenged
by its increasingly critical investors

SMALLER companies that receive backing from venture and development
capitalists seem to be emerging from the recession more rapidly than their
larger counterparts. Stock market interest in venture backed companies is
stronger now than for many years and in recent months a succession of
venture funded firms has obtained a listing.
Significant deal flow - attractive propositions worth backing - is yet to
appear in this initial stage of recovery, but all the indicators point to an
upturn in worthwhile investments. Behind the scenes, however, the venture
and development capital industry is undergoing an intensive overhaul.
The practices and assumptions by which the industry has lived for the past
10 years are being challenged by its increasingly critical investors.
The changes currently under way include:
A search for a more rigorous set of valuation guidelines to meet investor
concern at the leeway venture funds have to fudge performance.
Work on performance measures which will allow investors to compare the
results of the funds in which they are invested and to monitor the
performance of their own in-house managers.
A radical rethink of the methods by which venture managers raise money from
investors. Institutions are increasingly unwilling to tie their money to the
traditional 10-year venture partnerships. A desperate search for funds by
venture capitalists is prompting some innovative new financing structures.
Hectic activity in a fast developing secondary market for venture
portfolios. This is driven by disillusioned investors seeking to rid
themselves of unwanted portfolios and by the need for venture capitalists to
increase the sums under management and hence their management fees. If
managers are unable to raise new money for their funds they will settle for
recycling existing portfolios. Some of these issues have already been faced
in the more developed US venture capital market, but they have yet to impact
strongly on the venture market in continental Europe. For the moment it is
the UK which is leading the way for venture capital throughout the
continent.
The British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) drew its first set of
valuation guidelines in 1991 to help investors assess the worth of their
portfolios.
The guidelines were a valuable first step for assessing portfolio worth, but
they still left too much room for subjectivity, says Mr Iain Tulloch, a
director of Murray Johnstone and head of the BVCA's valuation committee. A
revised set of guidelines is expected to be published in October.
The new guide imposes stricter rules for writing down investments and
requires more information for investors. Previously venture capitalists made
a provision for 'permanent' diminution of value, allowing the unscrupulous
to argue that a single poor set of results was not necessarily permanent.
Provisions must now be made whether or not the fall in value is permanent.
The next step for the venture capital industry is to use these more uniform
guidelines to draw a set of performance measures enabling investors to
compare different venture funds.
Reference to the thousands of investments made since 1980 is required to
devise any meaningful performance measures. The BVCA hopes to publish
initial performance data next year.
Performance indicators, when made readily available, will also enable the
venture capitalist to attract investors to sound funds. However, in making
fund performance more transparent the less successful funds will likely not
succeed.
Dissatisfaction with the fund performance has contributed to the sharp drop
in new money for the industry.
Independent UK venture funds, which account for about 45 per cent of all
activity but act as a bellwether for the industry, raised just Pounds 300m
in 1992, the third year of decline, according to BVCA figures. The
investment picture was more positive with UK funds investing Pounds 1.4bn, a
15 per cent rise on the year before. The BVCA remains concerned, however,
that the industry may have used up its funds 'pool' by the end of the 1990s.
For Europe as a whole, the stronger performance of some continental
economies in 1992 led to small increases in funds raised and amounts
invested. New fundraising increased by 0.6 per cent to Ecu4.2bn (Pounds
3.21bn) while investments rose 1.5 per cent to Ecu4.7bn, according to the
European Venture Capital Association.
The UK and European industry remained focused on later stage investments -
development capital, buy-outs and buy-ins - while start-ups and early stage
details continued in the minority.
Poor fund performance, leading to a more critical investor less inclined to
invest new money has forced the industry to become more inventive in its
fundraising activity and move away from the typical 10-year limited
partnership.
Baronsmead, a medium-sized independent fund has attempted to lure investors
with a promise to return committed funds at any time if requested and to
give investors a say in the choice of companies backed. Legal &amp; General
Ventures, part of Legal &amp; General life assurance group, has unveiled plans
for a series of rolling one-year funds which would return uninvested cash at
the year end.
Mrs Carol Ames, in charge of unquoted investments for Eagle Star Investment
Managers, says: 'Arrangements between investors and venture capitalists will
be made on more of an individual basis in future.'
Venture capitalists have become aware that in introducing new measures to
boost funds, the investor's approach to investments is becoming more short
term - leading to demands for impossibly early returns. Mr Jonny Maxwell,
manager of unquoted investments at Standard Life Assurance, says the growing
second hand portfolio and partnership market is changing the shape of the
industry.
'Cannibalism is well under way. Almost all the serious players are asking if
any portfolios are available. They are looking to poach contracts from other
managers,' he says.
Venture capitalists are even willing to accept lower management fees or a
smaller share in the capital gain to win a portfolio.
One venture firm, Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures, specialises in acquiring
unwanted portfolios and selling off investments. It is currently winding
down two portfolios.
'We don't have to apologise for the mistakes that have been made,' says Mr
James Nelson, managing director.
'If the original manager has paid Pounds 10m for an investment now worth
only Pounds 3m he will be reluctant to sell. We do not have that problem.'
Winding down portfolios early is encouraged by the reduction in profits over
time.
Change in the venture capital industry has been driven by investors'
dissatisfaction with fund performance and a growing awareness that they
deserve a better deal. The fundamental reforms now taking place should lead
to a more responsive and cost-effective industry by the late 1990s.
But change will not take place without casualties. Fund managers who can
adapt quickly might survive - for some it may already be too late.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (1): Worst may be
over - Powerful and predominantly positive forces at work in the global
economy suggest the present time is a period of dynamic change rather than a
weary recovery from recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor

<TEXT>
IT LOOKS as if the worst may be over. The big industrialised nations are
either out, or beginning to see their way out, of recession. Elsewhere,
activity is expanding rapidly in regions as far-flung as south-east Asia,
China, the Indian subcontinent and Latin America.
Although prone to jitters, financial markets think they have already scented
a better future. While businesses have been agonising about Japan's
unprecedentedly severe post-war economic slowdown and the painful recession
in continental Europe, bond and equity markets in the world's leading
economies enjoyed a bull run this summer.
The animal spirits of the global investing community have been stirred by
hopes of sustained expansion with low inflation: the holy grail of economic
policy that has so often eluded politicians and central bankers over the
past 40 years.
Investment conditions have certainly improved compared with a year ago.
Short-term borrowing costs, already low in the US and Japan, have since
fallen sharply in Britain and elsewhere. Although short rates are still
comparatively high in Germany and most continental European nations,
long-term rates in many countries have fallen to levels last seen at the end
of the 1960s while in the US they recently touched a record low.
But while clouds may be lifting, it is equally certain that disappointments
will lie ahead. It is difficult to enthuse about short-term prospects in
most big industrial countries. Germany's recession may have bottomed out,
but recovery will be difficult. Japan's downturn could have further to go in
spite of government stimulation measures. Britain appears an exception with
steady growth and a surprise drop in unemployment so far this year.
But the sluggish and patchy nature of the US economic recovery will probably
set a pattern of slow recovery for much of the developed world.
Unemployment in the industrial world will continue to rise for the
foreseeable future. More than 22m people are out of work in Europe,
according to the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, while the jobless total in the 24 industrialised nations of the
OECD is forecast to rise to 36m next year.
In spite of growing global interdependence, the industrial countries as a
group will continue to make heavy weather of international co-operation. The
Group of Seven, which some years ago looked as if it might develop into a
directorate to steer the global economy, has degenerated into a high level
talking shop of marginal utility.
A more serious issue for future global prosperity is the uncertainty over
whether the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks will reach a
successful conclusion this year.
The former Communist countries that made up the Soviet Union and its empire
in eastern Europe have still to master a difficult transition to
market-based from command economies. While some nations such as Poland and
the Czech republic are making progress, others, notably the former
Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are racked by war.
At the same time, poverty will continue to dominate news reports out of
Africa as civil war and bad governance stifle economic activity.
But the world has always been a mixture of good and bad, and such contrasts
between hope and despair are especially typical for a period of transition.
There are powerful and predominantly positive forces at work in the global
economy that suggest the present time is a period of dynamic change rather
than a weary recovery from recession and the inflationary excesses of the
1980s.
The collapse of communism has been accompanied by the spread of free market
ideas that are opening up huge areas of the world, from India in the south
to Siberia in the north, to more rapid development.
The end of the cold war has spawned a rash of geopolitical changes that will
bring economic opportunity in their wake. Racial harmony in South Africa and
peace in the Middle East will be difficult to achieve but are no longer
unthinkable.
A technological revolution - or, more accurately, several revolutions are
under way. Information and communications technologies, advanced automation
and robotics, and new materials such as polymers, composites and ceramics
are revolutionising production processes and products.
Although economists have so far found it difficult to measure the impact of
new technologies on productivity, global investment in manufacturing has
been remarkably strong in the face of recent economic slowdowns and
recession. It is likely that new technologies are also beginning to have a
positive impact on productivity in the service sector after several years of
often misguided investment. The short-term effect of such developments may
be large-scale job losses in formerly safe white-collar jobs, but the
changes should ultimately benefit mankind.
This revolution in technology and production is fuelling and being fuelled
by globalisation. It is an ugly word. But it means national boundaries and
habits are becoming less relevant to business decisions as investment flows
and production facilities move in quest of the highest possible returns or
market share. Globalisation is breaking down the old distinction between
industrialised and developing nations.
Such changes can leave policy makers wrongfooted. Governments, working to
older agendas, have found themselves opposing or challenged by market
forces. The past chaotic year in the European exchange rate mechanism was
one symptom of such stress. Another is the industrial world's inability to
reduce farm subsidies and fully support freer trade, unlike many of the
newly industrialising nations of Asia and Latin America.
Wise governments realise that the only intelligent response to the challenge
of globalisation is to make their economies more adaptable. In this spirit,
many countries are trying to address structural problems left over from the
past decade: soaring health expenditures threaten the US economy; Britain
worries about its rising social security budget; and Germany must reduce the
huge transfer of funds flowing to its new eastern Lander.
Likewise, officials and the public in Britain and the US are concerned about
standards of educational achievement and some fast-growing developing
nations are becoming increasingly aware of the hazards of pollution and
rapid urban expansion.
The 1980s have left a legacy of sharply increased public and private debt.
According to the OECD, gross public debt has nearly doubled to just under 70
per cent of the annual output of its member countries, from around 35 per
cent in the mid-1970s.
Lax monetary policies in Japan, the US, Britain and Scandinavia engendered
sharp asset price inflation and bubble economies in the late 1980s. The
correction has been difficult: the consequent process of debt deflation has
entailed a long period of balance sheet restructuring, curtailing growth and
hurting banks, companies and families in all these nations.
Some problems are especially intractable. The generous protection given to
agriculture in Japan and the European Community imposes a huge indirect
burden on family budgets and, particularly in the case of France and its
trading partners, exacerbates international tensions. But the political
clout of farm lobbies has so far outweighed economic arguments against
protection.
Communism's collapse and the disintegration of the Soviet Union have also
had far-reaching economic effects that must still be digested.
The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a triumph for western values, but
the badly thought-through unification of Germany has turned into a nightmare
for policy- makers. The inflationary pressures unleashed by German monetary
union prompted the Bundesbank to tighten credit conditions with little
regard for the economic welfare of its ERM partners.
The resulting strains saw the forced exit of Britain and Italy from the
system last September, followed by a series of devaluations affecting the
Iberian currencies and Ireland. They culminated with the speculative attack
on the French franc in July that finally forced EC finance ministers and
central bank governors to widen ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent from
2.25 per cent and 6 per cent previously.
The scale of speculation against the ERM was a graphic example of the impact
of deregulation and globalisation on long-standing policy arrangements. The
removal of exchange controls in preparation for the European Community's
single market at the end of last year made the ERM's system of fixed but
adjustable parities more vulnerable to speculative attack than at any time
in its 14-year history.
The past 10 years have seen a huge increase in the volume of funds that
investors can shift across frontiers. The Basle-based Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) estimated the aggregate daily turnover in the foreign
exchange markets at nearly Dollars 900bn in April 1992, equal to 13 times
the GDP of the OECD group of countries on an annualised basis.
Cheap telecommunications and computer equipment and a wide range of
derivative products have encouraged new and more aggressive companies to
embark on speculative transactions. New York hedge funds, such as the
Quantum Fund managed by Mr George Soros, delivered the coup de grace to
sterling last September. Normally conservative insurance companies and
pension fund managers were reported to have led the flight from the French
franc into the D-Mark in July.
Markets can change their views with astonishing speed. France's failure to
keep its currency in a 2.25 per cent band against the D-mark came only weeks
after it appeared that the franc might supplant the D-mark as the anchor
currency of the European Monetary System. As Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the
BIS general manager, observed recently: 'No country is isolated from the
policy behaviour, or misbehaviour, of others'.
Financial markets have shown that they can mount a direct challenge to the
monetary sovereignty of nations. So far, governments have no clear strategy
for dealing with this phenomenon. If the EC is any guide, it is likely that
they will reject turning back the clock and re-introducing capital controls.
Governments are more likely to take care that policies and economic
conditions in their countries show greater compatibility.
For capital movements are not just a short-term phenomenon. Foreign direct
investment flows have overtaken foreign trade as an engine of world growth.
Through foreign direct investment, multinational companies are having an
ever greater influence over the future of countries and their citizens.
Statistics published by the OECD earlier this month estimated the stock of
foreign direct investment by its 24 member states at Dollars 1,720bn in
1990, up from Dollars 440bn 10 years before.
Much of this spending has flowed among the industrialised nations. The drive
for a single European market encouraged Japanese car and electronics
manufacturers to set up plants in the UK. But rising costs and soaring
exchange rates in the developed world have also spurred much investment in
newly industrialising countries. A recent Thai government paper traced the
large increase in Japanese investment in Thailand to the Plaza agreement of
1985 which helped push the dollar lower and produced a surge in the value of
the yen.
But, as with most developments in the world economy, there are pluses and
minuses. In a recent report, Ms Gail Fosler, chief economist of the
Conference Board in the US, noted that business spending was growing in
countries with relatively low capacity utilisation rates, such as the US,
Canada and Mexico. This, she said, suggested that 'business spending is no
longer driven by business cycle considerations but by global competition'.
Mrs Sylvia Ostry, head of the Centre for International Studies at the
University of Toronto and a former chief economist at the OECD, goes
further. New technologies and foreign direct investment are creating 'global
overcapacity in industry after industry after industry', she says.
Mrs Ostry has predicted new types of friction between nations or trading
blocks as they adjust to these changed conditions. An early example was the
so-called social dumping case in which the Hoover company shifted vacuum
cleaner production from Dijon in France to its plant near Glasgow in
Scotland to take advantage of less regulated labour markets and lower social
costs.
The pressure of competition among the industrialised countries and from the
dynamic economies of east Asia and Latin America has become so remorseless
as to make some people think the unthinkable. During the summer, Mr
Jean-Claude Paye, the secretary-general of that free trade bastion the OECD,
said he would 'not rule out protectionism as a last resort' if it preserved
the industrialised world from social unrest caused by mass unemployment.
It is a moot point whether politicians and electorates in the industrial
world have adjusted their expectations sufficiently to the prospect of
cut-throat international competition and slower growth over the rest of the
1990s.
Low opinion poll ratings suggest that politicians have coped poorly in the
face of changing world economic conditions. It is a paradox that in an
increasingly interdependent global economy, politicians are having to deal
first and foremost with domestic issues to ensure their re-election.
The heady days of the 1980s, when Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French
President Francois Mitterrand and EC Commission President Jacques Delors
pushed ahead with plans for European economic and monetary union appear long
gone.
Slow growth - with the OECD forecasting growth of about 1 per cent for its
24 member countries this year after 1.5 per cent in 1992 - is no friend of
grand designs.
And yet, if the equity and bond markets are to be believed, a global
recovery is emerging.
The investment community is encouraged by the idea that the industrial world
might have seen the back of the inflationary binges of the past 40 years and
is returning to an era of price stability - such as existed in the 19th
century.
At the same time, the spread of market economics in the developing world
holds out the hope of continuing strong growth that will sustain global
demand.
The emerging recovery in the industrial world is getting off to a good
start. 'Unlike the economic recoveries starting in 1976 and 1983, this one
starts with low price-wage inflation to encourage long-term investment,'
says Mr Paul Horne, international economist of US brokerage house, Smith
Barney Shearson, in Paris.
But the path ahead is strewn with uncertainty. The impasse over the global
trade negotiations is an obvious risk.
The achievement of steady growth with stable prices also depends crucially
on whether the inflation of expectations, which has also been such a feature
of the post second world war period, can be scaled back in line with
monetary inflation.
If so, the world may be able to look back at the 1990s as an important
period of transition in which the difficult structural and employment
effects of a technological revolution were gradually overcome in the
industrial world, and rising productivity spread improved living standards
to all mankind.
If, on the other hand, governments, employees and businesses scramble for
ever bigger shares of a slow growing cake, what little growth there is will
give way again to inflation, stagnation or worse.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Britain's Olympic hopes end as Sydney tops vote
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTE CARLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SYDNEY is to host the Olympics in the year 2000, the International Olympic
Committee decided last night.
The vote dashed the hopes of Beijing to gain much-sought international
recognition and of Manchester to bring the Games to Britain for the first
time since 1948.
Beijing had been favourite to win. The Chinese government had made the
Olympics an intense foreign policy objective since 1990. Manchester was
eliminated in the third round of voting but was always far behind Beijing
and Sydney even though it led Berlin and Istanbul, the other two candidates.
China's candidature was favoured by the IOC's higher echelons as a symbol of
the Olympic movement's power to effect benevolent change in the world.
Voting members, however, were troubled by China's human rights record.
In the ballot among 88 IOC members in Monte Carlo, the Australian city beat
Beijing by two votes, 45-43, after four rounds of voting. It followed a day
of presentations by the five cities and three years of campaigning.
Beijing led through every round of voting until the last. Istanbul was the
first of the five cities to be eliminated, followed by Berlin. With
Manchester still in a three-way hunt, Beijing was within five votes of
outright victory. But when the British contender was eliminated, the bulk of
its support shifted to Australia; eight votes to Sydney and only three to
China.
Exuberant Australian representatives attending the announcement danced
around the conference hall, drowning out the rest of the speech by Mr Juan
Antonio Samaranch, IOC president. Some of the Manchester delegation broke
down in tears and hugged each other in consolation.
Sydney's victory may boost the drive for ending constitutional ties with
Britain being led by Mr Paul Keating, prime minister.
In an emotional television interview, Mr Keating alluded to this last night
when he said the Games 'will coincide with the centenary of our federation
and will show the world Australia as a nation in its own right'.
'Things can be so much better for Australia than many Australians believe.
Some very hard-nosed internationalists have just given the affirmative on
that.'
In Sydney, the result was celebrated by tens of thousands at Circular Quay,
which cradles the Opera House. Shares opened buoyantly with the market 26
points up in early trading.
A throng estimated at 15,000 in Manchester city centre did not allow the
loss to dampen their spirits, breaking into a mass rendition of 'Always look
on the bright side of life.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES traders appeared satisfied yesterday with a session which saw
stock index futures moving erratically before closing with the December
contract on the FT-SE 100 Index near to the fair value premium, writes Terry
Byland.
Trading volume eased as, in the early part of the session at least, tensions
over the political drama in Russia relaxed somewhat.
The session was punctuated by rumours, sometimes reported on the
international newswires, of developments or impending developments in
Moscow. Early trading saw the December contract move up to 3,041 before
reversing to 3,015.
Switching into UK gilts from other European markets inspired a closing rally
in equities and December closed at 3,025, a premium of 22 against cash,
compared with 24 on the fair value premium which allows for dividend flows
and the cost of carrying the underlying stocks until December. Volume
dropped from 15,230 to 10,303 lots.
Business in traded options fell sharply, from 42,110 on Wednesday to 28,690
yesterday, with the FT-SE 100 option recording 8,600 contracts against
14,753. The Euro FT-SE option traded 5,477 contracts, while pressures from
the equity market brought 1,475 deals in Guinness. J. Sainsbury saw 1,220
lots transacted as food retailer shares fell sharply, and Tarmac (1,062) was
also active.

FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities resilient to new
uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW uncertainties in Russia, together with discouraging corporate
developments at home, made for an erratic trading session in a London market
which barely managed to hold on to the Footsie 3,000 mark yesterday.
Firmness in the US dollar continued to help international stocks, where the
pharmaceuticals sector held steady following the announcement of the Clinton
administration's health care proposals. But among domestic stocks, both food
retailers and brewery issues fell back sharply.
It was a day of rumour and counter-rumour of developments in Russia. Share
prices opened in good form on overnight reports that President Yeltsin
appeared to be consolidating his position, but early gains were reversed as
unconfirmed rumours of clashes in Moscow reached London, usually to be as
swiftly rejected.
At best, soon after the opening, the FT-SE 100 Index was nearly 11 points
ahead at 3,018.4. However, the shine was quickly taken off the market by
disappointing results from the domestic consumer sector, which realerted the
stock market's concern over the uncertain recovery in trading per-formance
by leading British companies.
The 3,000 level was briefly lost again, and it was left to firmness in UK
bonds to help the equity market to a steadier tone at the close. Falling
yields in the domestic bond markets have provided a base for the latest
advance in share prices. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,001.3
for a net loss of 6.2.
The damage to the consumer sector came largely from disappointing interim
profits news from Guinness, which added to the market's unhappiness with
discomforting comments at its meeting with City analysts. Food retailers
suffered similar misfortunes after Wm Morrison Supermarkets confirmed
pressures on the sector's profit margins. Share prices were rapidly marked
down across the board, although traders said selling of the brewery issues
was not heavy.
The market's confidence in the recovery in the domestic economy was
challenged from other business sources in the UK. Halifax, a leading
building society, described the housing market rally as 'very delicately
poised', and United Newspapers said economic recovery remained 'patchy'.
However, UK market analysts remained confident that the London stock market
was showing great resilience, and succeeding in holding on to the Footsie
3,000 mark. Selling pressure was moderate, according to several leading
securities traders, and bargain hunters always appeared ready to enter the
market at its daily low points.
Lending support to such confidence was an upturn in equity dealing in the
final hour of trading, when share prices rallied from earlier losses.
Seaq volume finally totalled 713.3m shares, a satisfactory level from the
point of view of market profitability. On Wednesday, 670.7m shares were
traded through the Seaq network, for a highly satisfactory retail worth of
Pounds 1.56bn.
The London stock market is now about 3.7 per cent below its trading peak and
has this week resisted further losses which would take it to important
testing levels. Good levels of retail, or customer, business have indicated
that the investment institutions appear to be rebalancing portfolios rather
than selling equities.

FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Morrison tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing figures from food retailer Wm Morrison Supermarkets, seen as
the glamour stock in its field, sent the company's shares tumbling and
prompted a sharp retreat in the sector, subsequently the worst performing
area of the FT-SE 350 Index.
Interim profits at Pounds 38.2m were well below market forecasts. Analysts
were particularly disappointed by the decline in margins from a company
generally seen to improve margins even in difficult times. A cautious
trading statement that seemed to signal further difficulties in the second
half also played a part in damaging sentiment. The shares dropped 23 to
106p, as analysts downgraded full year figures. Robert Fleming reduced its
forecast by Pounds 11m to Pounds 89m and warned: 'Those who need performance
over the next 18 months will not find it in this sector.'
Mr Tony MacNeary at Natwest Securities cut his current year estimate by
Pounds 8m to Pounds 92 and said: 'Today's slump in the share price reflects
the reality of the resurgence of stiff competition in the food market.'
Figures from Morrison came two days after Tesco, one of the big three
retailers, also produced disappointing numbers and revealed a decline in
margins. Yesterday a wave of gloom swept over the sector as dealers
reflected on both sets of figures. Tesco lost 11 to 198p, J. Sainsbury fell
20 to 420p, Kwik Save tumbled 20 to 686p and Asda shed 2 1/2 to 59 1/2 p.
HSBC Holdings, a significant constituent of the Hong Kong stock market, rose
9 1/2 to 693 1/2 p on follow-through buying after optimism that the
International Olympic Committee would choose Beijing to host the 2000 games
pushed the Hang Seng index higher the previous night.
Analysts said acceptance of a Beijing bid would be a sign that the West was
prepared to forgive China on human rights issues.
The Beijing argument spilled over to Cable and Wireless, which has a
majority stake in Hong Kong Telecom. The shares also benefited from a big
buy order in late trading and a bounce as the reaction to Vodafone's
competitive attack on Mercury's one-2-one telephone service was considered
overdone. Cable shares improved 8 to 861p while Vodafone eased 2 1/2 to 491
1/2 p.
Sentiment from Guinness hit the rest of the brewing sector. Allied-Lyons
fell 12 to 571p, while Grand Metropolitan, recommended yesterday by Lehman
Brothers following a company visit, shed 6 1/2 to 407 1/2 p.
The poor sentiment in Northern Foods that followed an analysts visit to the
company earlier this week continued to drive the stock lower, losing 8 at
249p. Unigate retreated 12 to 385p in sympathy.
Reports of problems at Thorn EMI's Rent-A-Center stores in the US sent the
shares into retreat as many dealers in the stock turned cautious. Thorn
weakened 33 to 944p on 4.5m shares dealt, with traders reporting the
availability of large lines of stock.
Sentiment was further damaged by a profits downgrade from BZW. The
securities house trimmed its full year estimate for the year to March 1994
by Pounds 4m to Pounds 350m.
Builders merchants were boosted by encouraging results from Travis Perkins,
which announced interim profits of Pounds 9.3m, against Pounds 5.2m
previously, and net operating margins of 5.4 per cent, up from 3.2 per cent.
Travis jumped 30 to 275p, while Wolseley rose 15 to 645p and Wickes 10 to
112p.
However, Pilkington fell 2 1/2 to 151p, with UBS turning seller, arguing
that the company had a stretched balance sheet and offered limited yield and
income growth.
A profits downgrade from Smith New Court weakened Cookson Group, leaving the
shares trailing 8 1/2 to 193 1/2 p. Smith reduced its full-year figure by
Pounds 5m to Pounds 92m saying it was cautious on the company's European
markets.
Mirror Group Newspapers firmed a penny to 178p as shareholder approval of
settlement of claims between the publishing group and private companies
belonging to the late Robert Maxwell which paved the way for sale of the
54.8 per cent Maxwell stake in the company. After the market closed the
administrator announced that the bidding for the stake sale via a
book-building process would begin on Monday and all bids would be in by
October 1.
United Newspapers gained 7 to 556p as the company announced improved
half-year profits and the proposed sale of its Extel financial service.
Television group Anglia saw its shares rise 13 to 375p in spite of a sharp
fall in first half profits to Pounds 2.12m from Pounds 5.17m.
In the stores sector, a profits warning from Laura Ashley hit the shares,
and they closed 22 lower at 87p.
A firm US dollar helped a number of internationally traded stocks. RTZ, the
world's biggest mining group, added 7 at 690p. However, Panmure Gordon
believes the shares are expensive at that level and a short term sell.
Shell Transport firmed 6 1/2 to 644 1/2 p ahead of the OPEC meeting at the
weekend.
Leather goods and clothing company Pittard slumped 12 to 47p. the biggest
percentage fall in London stocks yesterday, in reaction to disappointing
half year results.
The first day of trading in Shield Diagnostics, the biotechnology company,
saw the new shares open at a premium of 6 but ease 2 to close at 116p. Some
5.5m shares were placed with institutions at 112p a fortnight ago.

FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The much heralded presentation by President Clinton on the proposed health
care reforms proved something of a diluted cocktail, and the relevant UK
stocks traded sideways after an initial marketmaker-inspired lift at the
start of trading.
Most analysts had seen the full text of the proposals at least a week ago
and most investors with an interest in the area had read leaked US press
reports. Both the text and the reports contained more detail than the
President provided.
Specialists said companies would have to provide 15 per cent discounts to
Medicare, the state programme for the elderly which accounts for a third of
US sales, but this would in part be compensated by increased turnover. Mr
Nigel Barnes of Hoare Govett said Glaxo could be expected to lose 4 per cent
of US turnover but he had already factored in a 2 per cent fall.
Glaxo was steady at 642p but Wellcome was hit, its shares slipping 9 to 709p
ahead of a conference on Sunday at which SmithKline Beecham may produce
comparative data on a rival herpes drug to Wellcome's Zovirax.
SmithKline is due to announce details of the first head-to-head trial of its
herpes treatment at a meeting in Copenhagen. SmithKline 'A' shares eased to
end the day 4 lower at 421p.
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries rebounded 10 to 472p after
President Clinton made no reference to a tax on alcohol and cigarettes in
his health care speech. However, Rothmans International, which is also
overshadowed by worries that it might lose its Footsie status, shed 4 to
645p.

FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in spirits and brewing group Guinness fell sharply, losing 7 per cent
of their value after analysts lowered full year profits expectations after
the group reported interim figures at the bottom end of market forecasts.
Profits fell 9 per cent to Pounds 320m, from Pounds 353m at the same stage a
year earlier, and were accompanied by a warning of weak trading conditions
in the second half. However, it was the news that the group was to make a
Pounds 30m charge in its year-end results due to a contribution to its
pension fund that stunned researchers. Guinness shares plunged 32 to 427p in
hectic selling that saw volume jump to a hefty 17m as analysts cut their
forecasts.
Lehman Brothers, a long term bull of the stock, was one of the day's big
sellers after it downgraded its recommendation from a buy to a hold for the
first time in four years. It reduced its full year profits estimate sharply,
going from Pounds 953m to Pounds 890m. Explaining the day's performance of
the stock, an analyst at the US investment house said: 'We are looking to
1995 before we will see any improvement in earnings. The market does not
have that kind of patience.

FT  24 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Outlook for economy depresses
the cyclicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
IN SPITE of rising bond prices and a cooling off in the Russian political
crisis, bad economic news depressed cyclical stocks yesterday, although
secondary issues fared much better, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.27 at 3,539.75, but
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.54 at 457.74, while
the American SE composite finished 2.42 ahead at 452.71 and the Nasdaq
composite up 6.70 at a record high of 752.24. New York SE volume was 275m
shares.
The pattern broken on Wednesday by the Dow's near 10-point gain reasserted
itself yesterday: cyclical stocks suffered, while much of the rest of the
market held steady or prospered. Cyclical shares have been in the doldrums
because investors are increasingly worried about the outlook for the still
struggling US economy. Those concerns were fuelled yesterday by bad news
from the labour markets. The number of people claiming state unemployment
insurance rose 11,000 during the week ended September 18, a much bigger
increase than analysts had been expecting.
The fact that the bad jobs data sparked a big rally in bond prices - the
benchmark 30-year bond rose half a point, and the yield dropped close to 6
per cent - did not help the equity markets, however.
Paramount Communications, which has risen sharply since Viacom, and then
QVC, unveiled multi-billion dollar takeover bids for the company, receded
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 76 7/8 in busy trading on reports that Viacom is
unwilling to increase the value of its offer to match QVC's counter-bid.
Viacom, listed on the American Stock Exchange, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
60 1/4 on the reports, while the Nasdaq-listed QVC rallied from an early
loss to finish Dollars 1 3/4 up on balance at Dollars 61 3/4 .
Sears Roebuck shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 in volume of 1.8m shares
after the big retailing group warned that its fourth-quarter results may not
be as buoyant as in the same quarter a year ago.
Among cyclicals hit again by economic worries were Caterpillar, down Dollars
 5/8 at Dollars 77 1/8 , International Paper, off Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 59
3/8 , Aluminum Company of America, Dollars  7/8 lower at Dollars 67 3/8 ,
and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Dollars  5/8 easier at Dollars 103 3/4
.
Wednesday's news that Travelers will merge with Primerica continued to
support the former, up another Dollars 1 at Dollars 37 5/8 , while Primerica
moved Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars 48 3/8 .
Storage Technology dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 25 1/2 after warning
that it will make a big loss in the third quarter.
Selected drug issues were in demand the day after President Clinton unveiled
his health care reform plan. Schering-Plough rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 65
1/4 and Pfizer put on Dollars 2 at Dollars 62 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO rose in moderately active trading. The TSE 300 index ended 15.9 up
at 3,970.9 and advances led declines by 378 to 350 after volume of 57.2m
shares valued at CDollars 563.8m. Golds put on 1.33 per cent.

FT  24 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Indian investors form a queue for new
issues - Renewed interest in equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian companies are planning an unprecedented wave of corporate
fund-raising, which will test the capacity of the country's capital markets
to the limit over the next few months.
First in a queue of big issues is Reliance, the textiles and chemicals
combine, which yesterday launched a Rs8.6bn (Dollars 277m) slice of a
Rs21.7bn convertible debenture issue by a new company - Reliance Petroleum,
which is building a Rs51.4bn oil refinery.
It is the biggest public offering made in India, raising funds for the
largest-ever industrial investment.
Reliance will be followed by about 15 other companies, each planning to
raise Rs1bn or more in equity and bonds before the end of the year.
Brokers estimate that, altogether, some 800 companies are planning issues
totalling Rs110bn by the end of December. This compares with an estimated
total of Rs92.5bn expected to be raised in the six months to the end of
September, the first half of the 1993-94 financial year, and Rs185bn raised
in the whole of 1992-93.
The rush to raise money reflects a belief that the financial scandal which
hit the securities markets last year has almost run its course.
The market's strong surge this summer tends to support this argument, though
the scandal is still able to deliver unexpected shocks.
Only this month shares on the Bombay stock exchange suffered a nasty tumble
when it emerged that income tax inspectors had frozen dealings in blocks of
shares linked to Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of the
scandal. Hasty intervention by the Finance Ministry, which gave an assurance
that innocent investors would not suffer, restored confidence in the market.
The BSE index, which was closed yesterday, ended at 2,751 earlier in the
week.
However, according to data supplied by the IFC, the private sector arm of
the World Bank, India remains among the worst performing emerging markets in
dollar terms over the year to date.
With bank lending rates high - standing at an official minimum of 15 per
cent - companies are prepared to risk the perils of the capital markets.
Corporate bonds yield about 14.5 per cent, whereas the yield on equities is
under 1.5 per cent.
Few individual Indian investors look at the yield of a new issue. They are
after the quick speculative profits to be made from 'stagging' - buying the
stock in a public offer and then selling as soon as possible on the open
market.
Although share manipulation is forbidden, it is easily done since 75 to 85
per cent of all trades consist of deals in an informal forward market called
badla. So investors who expect brokers to help launch a new issue by pushing
up the share price are rarely disappointed. They just have to remember to
sell in time.
The success of an issue depends critically on the broker's marketing skills.
The streets of Bombay and other cities are hung with banners promoting
offers, although they have become more conservative since the Securities and
Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, banned the portrayal of
scantily clad models.
Brokers do not expect investors to disappoint Reliance. The group's last
large offering, a combined issue of Rs7bn by Reliance Polypropylene and
Reliance Polyethylene, attracted applications from 10m individuals.
For Reliance Petroleum, the group has devised a complex mix of sweeteners,
which reflect the increased technical sophistication of Bombay's financiers.
Investors will be permitted to pay for their paper in four instalments over
three years. Their securities will consist of convertible debentures with
detachable equity warrants. Investors will have no less than three ways of
converting their bonds into combinations of warrants, equities and cash. The
offer document runs to 101 pages.
As well as the Rs8.6bn public offering, Reliance is offering paper worth
Rs8.6bn to Indian institutions and mutual funds, Rs2.2bn to foreign
institutions, and Rs2.2bn for shareholders of Reliance Industries, the
group's flagship company. Reliance Industries itself is putting up Rs5.77bn.

FT  24 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Russia stories darken bourse
afternoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to hold key interest rates unchanged was expected,
reported relatively early in mid-morning, and did nothing to disturb the
bourse recovery which was taking place at that stage, writes Our Markets
Staff.
However, share prices fell back in the afternoon, on rumours of unusual
troop movements in Russia, and a Moscow news agency story that opponents of
President Yeltsin were planning an attack on the main building of the
Russian defence ministry.
FRANKFURT moved from 1,916.31 at the official close, with the DAX index up
23.51, to just 1,902.38 in the post-bourse, only a fraction above its final
mark on Wednesday afternoon.
Over recent days both German and British strategists and analysts, working
for B Metzler in Frankfurt and Kleinwort Benson in London, have said that
there was relatively little to go for in German equities. But, during the
session, the pattern of stock and sector rotation seemed to continue
regardless.
In carmakers, Daimler lost DM2 to DM750 against the market trend, reflecting
job cuts scheduled at the cost of a DM1.5bn charge on earnings in the second
half of 1993. Volkswagen rose DM11.50 to DM367 on its big European sales
ambitions for a variant of its Golf model, for a low addition to its
production costs.
Turnover fell from DM8.4bn to DM6.4bn. Within that, Veba shot up the active
stocks list to end second in turnover of DM726m. Mr Peter Bohnke of Bank
Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that there was a buying order for the shares,
and rumours that it might be the next German stock to list on Wall Street.
PARIS fell back 1 per cent under pressure from a further round of
disappointing interim results. The CAC-40 index ended off 22.43 at 2,057.53.
LVMH came out early in the session with first figures which were slightly
worse than some brokers' forecasts. However, the fall in the share price,
down FFr168 or 4 per cent at FFr3,924, was exacerbated by the group's
statement that full year earnings were unlikely to match those in 1992.
Mr John Wakely of Lehman Brothers in London commented that the group was
likely to remain under pressure until there was an upturn in trading
conditions in the Far East; but that by contrast to Guinness of the UK, in
which it holds a minority stake, 1994 could turn out to be a reasonably good
year.
Skis Rossignol went against the trend with a gain of FFr183 to FFr1,553
after noting that 1993/94 profits should be more than twice the 1992/93
level.
AMSTERDAM added to Wednesday's gains with a rise in the CBS Tendency index
of 0.5 to 124.1.
PolyGram was actively traded after announcing that it had set the price of
its 9.5m new shares to be issued to help fund the acquisition of Motown
records at Fl 62.20 outside the US and Dollars 34.00 in the US. The shares
rose 90 cents to Fl 63.10, and those of its parent group, Philips, by 50
cents to Fl 35.80.
Heineken continued its recent downtrend, losing another Fl 2.10 to Fl
179.50, while Royal Dutch picked up Fl 3.30 to Fl 181.60 and Unilever Fl
1.30 to Fl 201.30.
ZURICH opened firmly in response to a market rumour that a Swiss discount
rate cut was imminent, but gave up half the gain in response to a disclaimer
from the National Bank president. The SMI index finished 11.2 higher at
2,425.8.
Schindler bearers added another SFr250 to SFr6,050 in the wake of
presentations to analysts in London and Zurich, and a buy recommendation
from Lehman Brothers.
Roche reflected analysts' recommendations and positive press comment, the
bearers adding SFr50 to SFr8,790.
MILAN was disappointed by July's industrial production figures, and nervous
about forthcoming first half company results. The Comit index edged 2.86
higher to 592.80.
Olivetti gave up some of Wednesday's gains to finish L21 lower at L1,953 in
heavy volume ahead of results today.
Fiat finished L43 lower at L5,896 after a day's high of L6,065, as attention
focused on results due next Tuesday.
Banks turned in a firm performance with Credito Italiano L60 higher at
L2,593 after its announcement late on Wednesday of a 55 per cent rise in
first half profit to L632bn.
Benetton, also due to report shortly, shed L167 to L23,617: Merrill Lynch
upgraded its earnings estimates for 1993 and 1994, commenting: 'We continue
to like the stock, despite its performance.'
BRUSSELS fielded a 5.4 per cent plunge in the Belgian flagship holding
company, Societe Generale de Belgique, after it announced a dip in
first-half 1993 group net profit and the sale of its cement-making unit,
CBR.
However, the Bel-20 index still managed to close 0.08 higher at 1,278.61 in
turnover of BFr1.25bn, with SGB BFr100 lower at BFr2,490. Ms Rachael Rowe of
Kleinwort Benson said of SGB that the share price reflected both the fall in
profits, and disappointment with the selling price for the CBR stake.
ISTANBUL rose 2.6 per cent to a new high, the composite index closing 384.2
higher at 14,886.6, boosted by a cut in the rate of a one-year government
bond.
TEL AVIV rose after parliament approved an Israel-PLO agreement on self-rule
in the occupied territories, the Mishtanim index rising by 4.12, or 1.8 per
cent to 231.73.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Uncertainty underpins dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR gradually moved higher against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday as dealers remained uncertain how the political crisis in Russia
was playing itself out, writes James Blitz.
When London trading opened, dealers remained calm about the situation and
the dollar hovered around the DM1.6275 level. But there were reports at
about lunchtime in London that telephones in the Russian Defence Ministry
were not being answered. This caused a general air of panic in the market,
and the dollar moved up to DM1.6375, benefiting, as usual, from its
traditional status of a safe haven in times of trouble.
In the afternoon, the dollar moved higher in two phases. First, the latest
weekly US unemployment figures were issued, showing a rise of 11,000. These
underlined fears about the state of the US economy.
The final push up to the day's peak of DM1.6475 was not triggered by
specific news. Instead, one dealer said hedge fund managers in New York had
been surprised by the lack of news in Moscow towards the end of the day and,
with uncertainties still remaining, they decided to play safe and go long of
the US currency.
The dollar failed to move any higher, partly because DM1.6475 is an
important chart point and also established the high for the dollar in the
immediate aftermath of news that President Yeltsin had imposed direct rule.
It later eased back to close at DM1.6450, after a previous DM1.6285, and in
New York it ended at DM1.6435.
In the immediate future the dollar could remain well underpinned. Some
dealers are expecting strong durable goods orders figures for August in the
US today, with the consensus forecast looking for a monthly rise of 1 1/2
per cent.
The absence of any resolution to the crisis in Moscow could underpin the
dollar further out as well. Mr Yeltsin plans parliamentary elections later
this year and presi-dential elections in June 1994. In the interim, the
market is bound to be panicked by the ebb and flow of events.
The D-Mark was weaker across the board, on a day which also saw a fall in
German government bond prices. Again, the market's perception was that
Germany was the country with most at risk in the Russian crisis, because of
Bonn's close ties with the region.
Against the French franc, the D-Mark closed at FFr3.481 from a previous
FFr3.483. Sterling performed well against the D-Mark for most of the day,
but lost some of its gain before the close. The pound finished at DM2.4775,
up from a previous DM2.4750.
Once again, the yen was sidelined by the Russian crisis, not least because
the Japanese market was on holiday on Thursday. There was buying of yen for
D-Marks in Europe and this helped the Japanese unit to appreciate against
the dollar, closing at Y106.00 from a previous Y106.45.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Money Markets: German futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING nervousness about the situation in Russia led to a new flight of
safe haven funds into the dollar yesterday and this helped to push down the
value of most German money market instruments, writes James Blitz.
There was no specific news from Moscow to trigger concern in the markets.
But it was still unclear yesterday whether President Boris Yeltsin had won a
resounding victory in the political struggle being waged there.
Dealers have sold German instruments at times of tension in eastern Europe,
out of fears that there is substantial German investment in the region.
The December short sterling contract fell 3 basis points to close at 93.88,
and the March 1994 contract declined 1 basis point, finishing at 94.42.
There was no suggestion that the fall in these prices had been due to the
Bundesbank's decision to leave its Lombard and discount rates unchanged.
Most of the market had been of the view that the central bank would not
change monetary policy at Mr Helmut Schlesinger's last meeting as Bundesbank
president. The central bank would not have wanted there to be any
misinterpretation of decisions made during the presidential handover.
In the German cash market, call money edged down slightly, benefiting from
Wednesday's net injection of DM5.2bn into the market. Dealers said that
recent pressure from German tax requirements had also faded.
Overnight funds traded at 6.85 per cent, a little lower than Wednesday's
6.93 per cent. However, dealers said that the call money rate was unlikely
to ease much more in the near term.
French franc interest rate futures were little changed on a day which again
brought no cut in the Bank of France's official interest rates. But the
recent weakness of the D-Mark as a result of the crisis in Russia will
almost certainly have helped the French authorities to buy D-Marks and build
up reserves.
Sterling interest rate futures were a little more buoyant because of the
pound's stronger performance against the D-Mark. The December short sterling
contract moved up one basis point to close at 94.33. Three-month sterling
interest rates again ended at 5 7/8 per cent. Most of a Pounds 1.25bn
shortage was removed by lunchtime.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemeni oil industry enters a
new era - A development that has increased the country's output by two
thirds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Occidental Petroleum yesterday boosted Yemen's oil production by 60
per cent with the opening of its new fields in Masila.
Brought on stream after an accelerated programme of development, Canadian
Oxy's 120,000 barrels a day will increase Yemen's total output to just over
300,000 b/d. But more importantly, the new fields may open the way to
further discoveries in coming months.
Yemen's oil was first discovered in 1984 by the Dallas-based Hunt Oil
Company, with further finds in 1986 by the former Soviet company,
Technoexport.
Taken together, the two sets of finds suggested the presence of a
north-south oil trend and prompted Canadian Occidental to bid for a
concession of its own in 1987.
Concentrating its exploration efforts in the north-west corner of its 37,200
sq km concession area, Canadian Oxy began drilling in September 1990 and
struck oil with its first well in January 1991.
By December 1991, the company had drilled 14 wells and declared
commerciality with an estimated 235m barrels of recoverable oil. Since then
it company has drilled another 37 wells and increased its estimate of
recoverable reserves to 460m barrels.
Following its declaration of commerciality, the company began an accelerated
construction programme to develop its production and export facility. In
addition to the 51 wells and 55km of oil-gathering pipelines, Canadian Oxy
has now constructed a central processing facility to purify and blend the
oil, a 138km pipeline to the Gulf of Aden and an export terminal at
Ash-Shihr with a loading rate of 60,000 barrels an hour.
According to the production sharing agreement, the Yemen government will
take 70 per cent of the liftings and Canadian Oxy 30 per cent. That shareout
will sharply increase the country's export earnings. Prior to the new
production levels, the government was understood to receive about 90,000 b/d
from the Hunt field, of which 65,000 were used for domestic consumption.
Added to the remaining 25,000 b/d per day, the new production figures from
the Canadian Oxy field should give the government roughly 109,000 b/d day
for export.
The increased production will be a boon to Yemen's sagging economy and
political structure. Since the Gulf War unemployment has stood at 36 per
cent and annual inflation at 100 per cent. In October 1991 and again in
December 1992, there were protest riots which left over 100 dead and many
more injured.
To maintain optimism, the government has long played up news of the
country's oil potential and Canadian Oxy production will provide some
justification for the its claims.
Apart from the immediate rise in production figures, however, the Canadian
Oxy discoveries have created a sense of optimism about further oil potential
in the country. So far the company has fully explored only about 20 per cent
of its own concession area and has now stepped up the pace of exploration to
the east and south of Wadi Masila. Mr Ray Irani, chairman of the boards of
US and Canadian Occidental, has expressed optimism that more oil will be
found in the concession area and in the country as a whole.
'With oil production now at 300,000 b/d and increasing in the future, the
prospects for Yemen's hydrocarbons industry are bright,' Mr Irani said.
That view is shared by other companies operating in the region, particularly
Total, Clyde Petroleum, and Lasmo Oil (Aden), which hold concession areas
adjacent to Canadian Oxy's. Indeed, Total's recent discovery of 12,000 b/d
in block 10, just east of Wadi Masila, now suggests that there may be
another trend running to the north-east through the Canadian Oxy concession
into those of Clyde and Lasmo.
Mr Rod Makin, Lasmo's general manager, confirms the possibility of such a
trend and is cautiously optimistic about his company's prospects regarding
it. 'We are very hopeful about our chances in the Hood block, which is on
one of the oil pathways of Yemen. We think we are on a trend and it just
depends how far the trend extends,' he says.
Lasmo began drilling its first well on September 1 and preliminary results
could be available within a few weeks. Mr Makin underlines the significance
of the results with care. 'This well and our next could be the turning point
by proving the extension of the trend into the north-east,' he says.
Mr Peter Bradley, general manager of Clyde, could not agree more. 'Yes', he
says, 'the big question now is how far the trend extends. In that regard the
Lasmo wells are important and could be most encouraging for us. They would
automatically tell us that similar structures are in our fields. We have our
fingers crossed.'
According to Mr Bradley, Clyde will begin its exploratory drilling on
November 1 this year.
'Clyde is reasonably optimistic, but we don't want to overplay it,' he says.
'This still is the exploration business and the next six to nine months will
be a very intersting time for us.'
Exploring for oil in Yemen is indeed risky. Most production sharing
agreements now call for the collection of seismic data from at least 1,000km
of survey lines and the drilling of three exploratory wells, all within 30
months. Elsewhere, according to Mr Bradley, the time frame for exploration
is normally three or four times as long. Thus, in Yemen, companies are under
considerable pressure to produce quickly.
That pressure is increased by the size of concession areas and the nature of
their terrain. With concession areas ranging from 1,200 sq km to 37,200 sq
km, the odds are very clearly against exploration teams finding anything at
all. As Mr Bradley put it, 'no company can possibly cover its entire
concession area'. Thus, companies have to select carefully even before
undertaking their seismic surveys.
Because of the difficulties of the terrain, such surveys themselves can be
costly and the results hard to interpret.
Clyde, Lasmo, and Canadian Occidental are all operating on a plateau deeply
incised by meandering Wadis. That means seismic data must frequently be
collected by specialised vehicles - often helicopters - which can send costs
as high as USDollars 13,000 a kilometre. The variable nature of the terrain,
moreover, can affect the direction of seismic vibrations and produce
misleading data. And, with drilling rigs estimated to cost between USDollars
2m and USDollars 6m each, such mistakes can be very costly.
The odds against discovering oil in Yemen are therefore high and, not
surprisingly, the list of dry wells is growing. But the achievement of
Canadian Oxy is undeniable and has turned the eyes of oil men in new
directions. 'One thing is for sure', says Mr Bradley. 'From block 10
eastwards is now really wildcat country. It is so wide open.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's Gullfaks South field
declared commercial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, yesterday declared the Gullfaks
South oil and gas field commercial and said it would lodge a development
plan for the field late next year.
Gullfaks South has estimated gas reserves of 60bn cubic metres and oil
reserves of 125m barrels. It will cost an estimated NKr14bn (Pounds 1.3bn)
to develop, according to Statoil.
Production is likely to be from a wellhead platform, along with a new
process platform for gas, linked to the existing Gullfaks A platform. The
field will use oil processing capacity on Gullfaks A, which will become
available towards the end of the decade. In this case, it will come on
stream in 1998 with annual gas output of 5bn cu m.
Statoil said an alternative plan under consideration called for a record
length horizontal well to be drilled from the Gullfaks A platform, which is
situated 10km away from Gullfaks South. This would enable oil from the field
to come on stream earlier than gas output and would accordingly boost
profitability while providing an early return on investment. If this plan is
chosen, oil production could theoretically and technically come on stream
during 1995.
However, the field has a highly fractured, complex reservoir so a 10 km long
horizontal well would be a major challenge. Statoil's longest existing well,
on the Statfjord field, is 7km.
Statoil said gas from Gullfaks South was being considered as a source of
supply for a gas-fired power generation plant to be built by Britain's
National Power. The supply contract calls for annual deliveries of 2.2bn c m
a year from the second half of the 1990s.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agreement in sight on PNG gold
mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, THE world's largest mining group, and the Papua New Guinea government
have patched up their differences over how the USDollars 609m Lihir Island
gold project in PNG should be financed.
It is now suggested that all the present partners - including Nuigini
Mining, the Battle Mountain Gold subsidiary,as well as RTZ and the
government - pool their shareholdings in a new company, tentatively called
Lihir Gold, which would be floated on the Australian stock exchange.
Venezuelan Goldfields, a small Canadian explorer, would be involved and the
state-owned Malaysian Mining Corporation would be invited to take 20 per
cent of the floated vehicle.
Mr Maskett Iangalio, PNG minister of mining and petroleum, told his
parliament yesterday that by injecting USDollars 250m to Dollars 400m in
equity, project borrowings would be reduced to a manageable level and early
dividends could be paid.
Lihir has one of the biggest gold deposits outside South Africa, 40m ounces.
Mr Iangalio said, in order to preserve PNG's interest in the venture at 30
per cent, local investors would be given preferential treatment in the
proposed floatation.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grain forecast raised again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has increased its estimate for this year's
world grain harvest by 7m tonnes to 1.39bn tonnes from its August forecast
of 1.383bn, which was itself up 10m tonnes from a month earlier. Most of the
latest increase was attributed to coarse grains such as maize and barley.
In its latest monthly report the IWC forecasts wheat production at 575m
tonnes, up from 562m tonnes the previous year and an increase of 2m tonnes
from its forecast last month. The expected decline in the wheat harvest in
the European Community, central Europe and the US is expected to be more
than offset by bigger crops in Argentina, Canada, China and Russia.
World production of coarse grains is estimated to be 5m tonnes higher than
last month's prediction at 815m tonnes - but this marks a drop from 861m
tonnes in 1991-1992.
The decline in the coarse grains harvest is largely the result of disastrous
floods in the US corn belt. But India, Russia and Ukraine are now forecast
to produce more maize than had been expected.
The IWC pointed to some quality problems with this year's wheat because of
wet harvest conditions in France, Germany and the UK as well as early frost
in Canada. Rain also delayed US planting.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Poll virus' threatens
Pakistan's cotton
</HEADLINE>

ELECTION VIRUS could be one of the bugs to hit Pakistan's cotton crop this
year.
According to the latest assessments by the country's top cotton experts, the
crop is likely to exceed 11.5m bales, coming close to the government's 12m
bale target. However, farmers in the cotton belt around the city of Multan
in Southern Punjab as well as in other districts of the province, have spent
large amounts of money to support their candidates in the October 6 general
election, leaving them with tight budgets for pesticides.
Mr Zahoor Ahmed, head of Pakistan's leading cotton research station in
Multan, says pesticide dealers have reported a 10 to 20 per cent drop in
sales. 'The question is, how much will 'election virus' affect your
production. People are short of money for pesticides due to the elections,'
he says. Nevertheless Mr Ahmed is urging farmers to intensify vigilance
during the next month or so, to protect their crops against possible attacks
by the 'boll worm' virus.
Crops have generally been good this year, after 1992's devastation, caused
by heavy rainfall, floods and an attack by the leaf curl virus. In that year
just over 9m bales were produced, 3m short of target.
The US cotton crop is likely to be 17.65m bales, below the 17.9m bales
projected this month by US Department of Agriculture, according an executive
with National Cotton Council of America, reports Reuter from Scottsdale,
Arizona.
'That's good news because it means our carryover will be smaller,' said Mr
Mark Lange, director of economic services, told a NCC board meeting.
The USDA put 1993-94 starting stocks at 4.7m bales, up from 3.7m at the
beginning of the 1992-93 season. It forecast the carryover at the end of
this season at 6m bales.
Total US mill use for 1992-93 of 10.25m bales was up 640,000 bales from the
previous year. At best, Mr Lange said, 1993-94 mill consumption would to
reach 10.3m bales (in line with the USDA estimate) or remain even with last
year.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Curragh's troubles bode ill for
Yukon mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES FOR the revival in the near future of lead and zinc mining in Canada's
Yukon territory have faded with the collapse of Curragh, the Toronto-based
base metals producer.
An Ontario court this week appointed Deloitte Touche as interim receivers
for Curragh's Faro and Sa Dena Hes mines in the Yukon, after the beleaguered
company failed to find an outside investor willing to inject fresh equity.
Curragh is continuing its search for a backer. Its chairman, Mr Clifford
Frame, has recently been in Europe meeting prospective partners. Rumours in
Toronto suggest that he has had discussions with, among others, the Kuwaiti
government. Talks earlier fell through with two Korean companies that had
bid for a a 50 per cent stake.
Low zinc prices and Curragh's financial problems forced the closure of the
Faro mine last April. Faro's output totalled 66.7m lb of zinc and 51.2m lb
of lead in the first three months of this year. Sa Dena Hes, which is close
to the Yukon-British Columbia border, has been shut since last December.
Curragh's problems have also stalled development of the new Grum pit at
Faro. The company had been seeking CDollars 29m (Pounds 14.5m) from the
Yukon government to complete the pit.
A Yukon government official said, however, that the authorities 'are not
going to pump more money into the mine just to reopen it'.
The two mines are the cornerstone of the Yukon economy, employing over 1,300
people at their peak, and supporting many of the territory's small
businesses.
A spokesman for Curragh's unsecured creditors said that the long-term
outlook for the mines was 'fairly reasonable', depending on zinc prices  -
Faro needs a zinc price of about 50 cents a lb to break even, 25 per cent
above the prevailing market level.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: OPEC ministers to meet in
Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries gather in
Geneva tomorrow with the oil price languishing just above Dollars 16 a
barrel despite this week's upheavals in Russia, writes David Lascelles,
Resources Editor.
Analysts say that the ministers will have to hammer out an agreement to hold
production at around 24.5m barrels of oil a day - slightly less than the
third quarter peak but 920,000 barrels above the official ceiling - if they
are to provide the market with a firm underpinning.
However, this meeting has been preceded by less kite-flying than usual, and
analysts say the outcome is hard to call. Although the final quarter always
produces a rise in demand, with the onset of winter in the northern
hemisphere, there has been little indication that Opec is getting to grips
with its over-production problems.
The meeting will also have to address the question of how to re-integrate
Kuwaiti output into the production ceiling, and consider the return of Iraq
to the Opec fold.

<TEXT>
After briefly testing resistance at Dollars 360 a troy ounce the London GOLD
prices closed at Dollars 357.25, up Dollars 3 on the day. Traders attributed
the rally to concern about the situation in Russia, but one analyst
commented: 'The market is basically bearish ...The Russian rallies (on
Wednesday and yesterday) have just added to the disappointment because they
have been so short and have had no follow-through'. At the London Metal
Exchange COPPER prices slipped further as the cash/three months discount
widened from Dollars 11.50 to Dollars 18.50 a tonne in response to freer
availability of metal for immediate delivery. NICKEL prices rallied smartly
in the afternoon on news that Inco of Canada was to discuss production cuts
and cost cutting measures with unions. The three months price peaked at
Dollars 4,370 a tonne before easing on profit-taking to end at Dollars
4,340, still up Dollars 40. At the London Commodity Exchange both COCOA and
COFFEE futures reversed early falls, the former ending little changed and
the latter with modest gains in nearby positions.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of Assam, India's largest tea growing state, suffering a setback in
production in June and July, the country's tea output during the first seven
months of this year rose by 29.45m kg to 355m kg.
Excessive rains and a sudden spell of cold weather affected plucking of tea
leaves in Assam, industry officials said.
At 51.44m kg Assam's July tea production was down by 2.13m kg from the
corresponding month of 1992. The shortfall in production in the previous
month amounted to 1.07m kg. However, total Assam production of 173.17m kg up
to July was 2.85m kg more than in the same period last year.
The quality of Assam tea this season is generally satisfactory. Despite
floods, West Bengal recorded a production improvement of more than 12m kg at
78.39m kg over the first seven months of 1993. Darjeeling's increase of
nearly 1m kg to 6.04m kg was regarded as particularly remarkable. South
India's contribution to the production increase in the period was 14.44m kg,
Tamil Nadu's 62.74m kg, Kerala's 36.55m kg and Karnataka's 2.44m kg.
Industry officials said the trend of plucking up to the end of October would
decide whether India returned to the 1991 production level of 742m kg. Last
year the country's tea production suffered a major setback to 704m kg,
largely because of severe drought in South India.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Russian power struggle dominates European
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond trading was choppy yesterday with the market again
dominated by the power struggle in Russia. Dealers reported heavy trading
activity by the big investment and hedge funds, which boosted futures
turnover and left most cash markets trailing behind.
GERMAN bonds had another rollercoaster ride, with the Bund future edging
higher in the morning but falling sharply in early afternoon on confused
rumours of troop movements in Moscow. The contract slid as low as 98.25,
which one trader described as 'a glaring buying opportunity'. Indeed, the
price recovered slightly towards the close, ending at 98.42.
Trade is expected to remain erratic as long as uncertainty in Russia
persists. 'I wouldn't be surprised if some investors decide to leave the
German market and go elsewhere, given that we've had a very strong run
here,' said a Frankfurt trader.
Bunds today are likely to continue being driven by currency movements and
Russian rumours, as well as typical Friday position-squaring as traders seek
to reduce their exposure ahead of the weekend.
Dealers are also looking to the release of the regional September CPI,
expected today. The market has discounted a year-on-year rate of around 4.1
per cent, though forecasts range between 3.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent.
DUTCH bonds were dragged lower by weakness in the German market. The yield
spread was unchanged from Wednesday, with Dutch bonds yielding 20 basis
points below bunds.
UK GILTS were among the main beneficiaries of the continental markets'
weakness and ended nearly  1/2 point higher on the day. The 10-year yield
spread over Germany narrowed sharply on large switches from bunds into
gilts, with the yield gap between the 8 per cent gilts due 2003 and the 6
1/2 per cent Bunds due 2003 narrowing to around 86 basis points from 106
basis points two days ago.
The bulk of trading activity took place in the futures pits, where London
traders reported a massive switch by a US hedge fund into gilts out of
bunds. Retail activity was thin but the market has remained well supported
in recent days.
'With next week's gilt auction and the Russian troubles, there have been
enough reasons to sell - but no one did, which augurs well for our market,'
said a gilts trader.
FRENCH government bonds again tracked bunds, though France outperformed
Germany on the day. After yielding seven basis points over bunds early on
Wednesday, French 10-year bonds yielded two basis points below bunds at
yesterday's close.
As expected, the Bank of France did not cut interest rates at its latest
open-market operation, but this had limited market impact.
ITALIAN government bonds rose in the afternoon on a largely technical
rebound from recent weakness. The December BTP contract on Liffe rose half a
point to close at 112.86.
US Treasury prices posted solid gains at the long end following a weaker
than expected weekly jobless claims report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 102
17/32 , yielding 6.061 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 , yielding 3.908 per cent.
After more than a week of declines, Treasuries continued the rally started
on Wednesday. The spark that set off the latest round of buying was the
release of jobless claims data, which showed the number claiming state
unemployment insurance rose 11,000 in the week ended September 18, a much
bigger rise than forecast.
Prices, however, could not sustain all of their early momentum, and by late
afternoon the long bond had dropped back 1/4 point from its session high.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S bond market is heading for a record year, driven by a sharp fall in
interest rates, said Mr Erik Jarve, president of the Oslo bourse.
Mr Jarve forecast 1993 turnover in bonds of NKr660bn (Dollars 93bn), up from
NKr502bn last year and NKr425bn in 1991. He said the yield to maturity of
Oslo's Brix bond index had fallen to 6.94 per cent by August from 11.40 per
cent at the start of the year.
'Although the government has been an infrequent borrower in recent years,
this situation is likely to change,' he predicted. The central bank
estimates that NKr150bn is likely to be raised through domestic government
bond issues in the next five years.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Argentina's DM1bn offer heavily
oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Argentina's first D-Mark Eurobond issue since 1979 was given
an enthusiastic reception by investors hungry for high-yielding paper.
The DM1bn issue of five-year Eurobonds was so heavily oversubscribed that
trading in the bonds opened at 99.75, well above the recommended re-offer
price of 99.15.
Joint lead managers CSFB and Deutsche Bank decided to launch Argentina's
issue at a recommended rather than a fixed re-offer price because of the
high interest from retail investors.
The bonds rose as high as 100.20 for a short time but eased to around 99.40
in the late afternoon, in line with a fall in the German government bond
market.
At launch, the bonds were priced to yield 250 basis points over the Bobl
series 107 of medium-term German government bonds, at the bottom end of the
indicated range of 250 to 260 basis points. The spread on the bonds
tightened to around 235 basis points by the end of trading.
The spread on Argentina's bonds is expected to shrink further because of the
persistent demand for high-yielding paper. This trend is already under way
on the Republic of Venezuela's DM300m seven-year Eurobond offering, which
was launched last week.
Traders said the spread on Venezuela's bonds had fallen to around 270 basis
points over underlying German government bonds from 290 basis points at the
launch.
Meanwhile, the World Bank is getting closer to launching its first D-Mark
global bond issue. It is hosting a presentation for investors in Frankfurt
on October 6 and plans to hold similar meetings in other financial centres.
The offering is likely to be launched shortly after the completion of these
meetings. The World Bank has not yet disclosed any details about the terms
but the market expects the offering to raise between DM3bn to DM5bn and have
a maturity of 10 years.
There is also a belief that the World Bank could achieve a yield spread of
less than 10 basis points over underlying German government bonds.
Yesterday's other Eurobond offerings from Latin America were overshadowed by
Argentina's issue. Corporacion Andina De Fomento (CAF), the supranational
agency which finances economic development in the Andean region, priced its
Dollars 100m issue of five-year Eurobonds at the tightest yield spread
achieved by a Latin American borrower for debt with this maturity.
CAF's bonds were priced to yield 185 basis points over underlying US
Treasuries. Lead manager CSFB said the pricing reflected the fact that CAF
is the only financial institution in Latin America to have received an
investment grade credit rating. CAF is rated Baa3 by Moody's and BBB by
Standard &amp; Poor's.
Cia Suzano de Papel e Celulose, a Brazilian producer of eucalyptus pulp and
paper, made its first appearance in the Eurobond market with a Dollars 80m
issue of eight-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which were priced to yield 522
basis points over the interpolated eight-year US Treasury, has puts at the
option of the investor at the end of the third and fifth years of the bonds'
life.

ROCHE Holdings, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, yesterday completed the

The deal was structured as a private placement in the US market, under the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144a, which allows non-registered
companies to place paper with approved institutional investors.
The nominal amount of the offering is Dollars 1.42bn, which will raise
proceeds of Dollars 702m for Roche. The funds will be used to refinance debt
from Roche's acquisition of Genentech, the US biotechnology group.
The deal was arranged by Merrill Lynch, which developed the market in Lyons
 -which are zero-coupon convertible bonds - in the US.
The notes have a maturity of 15 years, with put options after five and 10
years at a yield to put of 4.75 per cent. The notes are convertible into
American depositary shares at an initial premium of 33 per cent, but this
premium increases during the life of the issue, since accrued interest is
forfeited upon conversion.
Dealers said the offering was viewed by investors as a fixed-interest
investment with an equity kicker. Roche's share price has performed well at
a difficult time for pharmaceutical stocks, and is well liked by analysts
because of its broad range of products and low operating margins.
However, the 33 per cent initial conversion premium was considered
aggressive by some traders.
Roche has made pioneering use of equity-linked instruments. In 1991, the
company launched an innovative Dollars 1bn 'bull spread' bond issue, while
earlier this year the company issued Dollars 1bn of seven-year Eurobonds
with 'knock-out' warrants.
The Lyons deal is designed to increase the company's investor base in the
US, and follows a a Dollars 275m issue of American depositary receipts
arranged by Merrill last year.

WILRIG, the Norwegian oil and gas drilling company, is to issue 4m American
depositary shares and make a Dollars 100m offering of senior secured notes.
The proceeds will be used to help finance the acquisition of new drilling
rigs, repay debt and boost working capital.
A Nasdaq listing will be sought for the 4.8m new shares, of which 2.8m would
be offered in the US and 1.2m elsewhere outside Norway. The company expects
to complete both the ADS and note offerings in November.
Wilrig's planned sale of 2.45m new ordinary shares to the Paris-based
Forasol-Foramer Group as part payment for the Dollars 41.5m acquisition of
two drilling rigs is not included in the ADS offering.
The company also has an option to buy a Drillmar I semi-submersible rig for
Dollars 34m from Spanish interests.

SIEMENS is to pay USDollars 38.5m for two Polish telecommunications and
electronic equipment producers in an agreement that gives it access, along
with Alcatel of Spain and AT&amp;T of the US, to the rapidly expanding Polish
telecoms market.
The deal signed yesterday also signals confidence by a major western
investor that Poland's market reforms will continue following the weekend
elections. 'We are moving ahead with full speed,' said Mr Lothar Plehwe, a
senior director at Siemens said in Warsaw. 'We hear that all the elected
parties want to continue with the process of privatisation.'
Siemens has promised to invest Dollars 57m over six years in the two plants,
ZWUT in Warsaw, which is primarily a telecommunications equipment producer,
and Elwro in Wroclaw, an electronics plant. Both companies have heavy
borrowings and Dollars 30.2m of the purchase price will go to covering debt.
Last year AT&amp;T paid Dollars 28m for the Telfa in Bydgoszcz and promised to
invest Dollars 45m in the plant. Alcatel has paid Dollars 37.3m for the PZT
works in Warsaw and Teletra in Poznan, and agreed to invest Dollars 60m in
both factories.
Ericsson of Sweden has been chosen as a prospective supplier of mobile radio
equipment for the armed forces in a contract worth around Dollars 100m. It
would also involve joint production with the Unimor television plant in
Gdansk.
TP SA, the Polish state-owned telephone monopoly which made a profit of
5,400bn zlotys (USDollars 277m) last year on sales of 19,000bn zlotys, plans
to invest some 10,000bn zlotys this year.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Viacom sues to block QVC bid for
Paramount
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIACOM, the US cable television company bidding for entertainment group
Paramount Communications, yesterday launched a legal broadside aimed at
blocking a higher bid from television shopping group QVC Network.
In a suit filed in the Federal District Court in New York, it alleges the
QVC bid is the latest in a series of monopolistic actions by Mr John Malone,
president of Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the largest cable television
service in the US, aimed at controlling the cable industry.
Mr Malone also heads Liberty Media, a cable programmer spun off from TCI,
which in turn has a large stake in QVC, which is headed by Mr Barry Diller,
a leading film industry executive.
The suit seeks damages for the harm done to Viacom by these alleged
monopolist practices and an injunction to stop the practices, including the
QVC bid. In a statement, TCI said it had 'anticipated the possibility of
frivolous lawsuits', even though it had no involvement in any Paramount
takeover activity.
Viacom's action came four days after QVC launched a hostile Dollars 9.5bn
bid for Paramount in response to an agreed bid from Viacom, which was worth
around Dollars 7.4bn on the basis of yesterday's stock market share prices.
However, Viacom maintained its suit had been planned long before QVC
launched its offer.
The action seemed to rule out for the time being a higher offer by Viacom
for Paramount.
Viacom is best known for its cable programming, such as the pop music
network MTV, but it is also a substantial cable service business.
The suit says that TCI, which covers about 20 per cent of the US cable
market, reaches a critical mass of viewers that are essential for the
success of any cable programmer and that Mr Malone uses that power to '
extract unfair and anti-competitive terms and conditions from cable
programmers, including Viacom.'
To support its case, it cites several examples of negotiations between the
two companies over programming in which TCI is alleged to have acted in a
threatening manner.
'Malone's monopoly power has intimidated the entire cable industry, but we
could no longer sit idly by as he and his controlled companies excluded
competing programmers from his cable systems and undermined our services and
those of other programmers,' Viacom added.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Pirelli still in red at halftime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, remained firmly in the red in
the first six months of this year, in spite of continuing efforts to lower
its break-even point by cutting costs.
Net losses amounted to L62.7bn (Dollars 40m) against net earnings of L77bn
last year. However, comparisons are clouded by extraordinary factors.
Although Pirelli said it had only remained in profit for the first six
months of 1992 because of extraordinary items and asset sales, this year's
result was also boosted by a L72bn extraordinary gain.
The gain represents part of the proceeds from the sale of Pirelli's shares
and options in Continental, the bigger German rival it tried to take over in
1990-91.
At the operating level, Pirelli claimed that this year's first-half net
losses of L23bn were in line with last year's figure.
Sales rose by 9 per cent to L4,640bn, largely because of the lower value of
the lira, which inflated foreign earnings in lira terms.
Group indebtedness remained little changed, while interest charges fell
slightly and should continue to decline in the second half, the company
said.
Pirelli warned that the outlook for the rest of the year remains gloomy,
meaning that trading in the second half is unlikely to show any improvement
on the trend reported in the January-June period.
Net results would continue to be affected by extraordinary factors, the
company said, in particular, continuing heavy restructuring costs and
write-downs.

<TEXT>
ADSTEAM, the Australian investment holding company which takes in the David
Jones department stores group, yesterday posted a ADollars 440.5m (USDollars
293.7m) loss before tax and extraordinary items for the year ended June.
This compared with a ADollars 722.3m deficit in the previous 12 months.
Adsteam said that at an operating level its businesses made profits of
ADollars 388.9m, up from ADollars 336.4m. However, total finance charges,
including lease finance charges, consumed ADollars 516.8m, slightly less
than last time's ADollars 638m. Abnormal losses sucked up a further ADollars
312.6m, against ADollars 420.6m.
The abnormals reflected a ADollars 290.9m writedown of property assets, a
reduction in investments, closure costs, and costs relating to the recent
Woolworths flotation.
The flotation came after the year-end, and profits on the share sale - which
have helped to slash Adsteam's debt - are not included in the 1992-93
figures.

<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Travelers, one of the biggest US composite insurance companies,
agreed yesterday to an offer from financial services group Primerica for the
73 per cent of the company it does not already own.
The Dollars 4.1bn deal had already been by approved by the board of
Primerica, but must still win the support of shareholders of both companies
and insurance regulators in a number of states.
The Travelers takeover would mark the culmination of a drive by Mr Sanford
Weill, chairman and chief executive of Primerica, to turn his consumer
finance, stockbroking and insurance group into one of the biggest
diversified financial services groups in the US.
Based on yesterday's market valuations of the two companies, the takeover
would create a group with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 17bn -
identical to American Express, the financial services group which Mr Weill
left in the mid-1980s to begin building his own operation.
Mr Weill said the deal would give Primerica 'an even more diversified
earnings stream, a large portion of which is recurring and predictable'.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Italian banks prepare for
privatisation - A financial transformation starting to take place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN a matter of months, three of Italy's biggest banks should either be
fully privatised or have a significant share of their capital floating on
the stock market.
The deals, involving Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, two
big banks owned by the IRI state holding company, and Istituto Mobiliare
Italiano, a state-controlled financial services group, are visible signs of
the transformation now taking place within Italian finance.
To be successful, the three deals will have to create popular demand at a
time when bank shares are suffering from sharply higher bad debt provisions.
Potential investors will also have to be persuaded they will not end up as
unprotected minorities in companies where decision-making is dominated by a
hard core of institutional and industrial interests.
To some extent this is a less likely scenario at IMI than at the two
IRI-controlled banks. Based in Rome, IMI's main activity is long-term
industrial lending, from which it has expanded into securities trading, fund
management, insurance and retail banking.
The group last week reported a net profit of L284bn for the first half of
1993: this is more than some bigger banks make in a full year. Though
earnings have been overshadowed by a long-running court case involving a
L900bn claim by the heirs of a former client, the bank is in sound financial
shape.
The government's decision to float an opening tranche of about 20 per cent
in IMI was based more on expediency than ideology after painfully-long
negotiations on a sale to a group of big savings banks led by Milan's
Cariplo failed earlier this year.
A flotation also represented a last option for IRI's controlling stake in
Credito Italiano since alternative informal soundings by Merrill Lynch, the
US investment bank, failed to identify a trade buyer or suitable pool of
foreign and domestic institutions willing to buy the bank.
Slightly bigger than Credito Italiano, its near neighbour in the heart of
Milan's financial district, BCI's strength lies in commercial lending. By
contrast, both banks have been relatively late converts to wide-scale retail
banking, once left to regional savings institutions, and have spent heavily
in the past three years extending their branch networks.
Investment in new branches affected earnings at both banks last year.
Profits were also hit by heavy write-downs on securities and higher loan
loss provisions. This year's outlook is for continuing pressure on earnings,
though buoyant income on securities trading should compensate partly for
what are expected to be much bigger loan provisions.
Given the weakness of the sector, analysts doubt there will be a stampede to
buy shares in any of the three banks about to be offered, although BCI is
expected to generate most interest.
However, one crucial factor may change matters. Italy's prime minister, Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, shares the determination of his predecessor, Mr
Giuliano Amato, to sell off state assets. The difference is that Mr Ciampi
seems much more disposed to use the stock market to do so.
Mr Ciampi has put public share offerings at the top of his government's
agenda. The fact that the Milan bourse has been Europe's best performer this
year has provided an additional head of steam.
However, there is at least one wild card in the pack. Many analysts believe
Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, is determined to gain control of BCI.
According to Milan banking legend, Mediobanca has for years nursed the hope
of creating a northern Italian financial powerhouse combining the talents of
BCI and Mediobanca.
Mediobanca's strength in financial services would be reinforced by having
powerful institutions such as the big Generali insurance group and the
Fiat-controlled Gemina investment concern as core shareholders, along with
some of northern Italy's leading private-sector industrialists.
There is also an element of self-interest behind such ambitions. The
privatisation of IRI's stakes in Credito Italiano and BCI could put
Mediobanca's own future into doubt.
Mediobanca' independence has until recently been assured by a complex
shareholding arrangement in which control is held by Credito Italiano and
BCI, along with Banca di Roma. The rest of its shares are either floating or
owned by a core of friendly private-sector institutions.
While Banca di Roma has indicated that it does not intend to change its
relationship with Mediobanca, the privatisation of Credito Italiano and BCI
could conceivably mark any number of new turning points.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Siemens pays Dollars 38m for
Polish telecoms producers

<TEXT>
SIEMENS is to pay USDollars 38.5m for two Polish telecommunications and
electronic equipment producers in an agreement that gives it access, along
with Alcatel of Spain and AT&amp;T of the US, to the rapidly expanding Polish
telecoms market.
The deal signed yesterday also signals confidence by a major western
investor that Poland's market reforms will continue following the weekend
elections. 'We are moving ahead with full speed,' said Mr Lothar Plehwe, a
senior director at Siemens said in Warsaw. 'We hear that all the elected
parties want to continue with the process of privatisation.'
Siemens has promised to invest Dollars 57m over six years in the two plants,
ZWUT in Warsaw, which is primarily a telecommunications equipment producer,
and Elwro in Wroclaw, an electronics plant. Both companies have heavy
borrowings and Dollars 30.2m of the purchase price will go to covering debt.
Last year AT&amp;T paid Dollars 28m for the Telfa in Bydgoszcz and promised to
invest Dollars 45m in the plant. Alcatel has paid Dollars 37.3m for the PZT
works in Warsaw and Teletra in Poznan, and agreed to invest Dollars 60m in
both factories.
Ericsson of Sweden has been chosen as a prospective supplier of mobile radio
equipment for the armed forces in a contract worth around Dollars 100m. It
would also involve joint production with the Unimor television plant in
Gdansk.
TP SA, the Polish state-owned telephone monopoly which made a profit of
5,400bn zlotys (USDollars 277m) last year on sales of 19,000bn zlotys, plans
to invest some 10,000bn zlotys this year.
Between 1990 and 1992, Poland installed some 800,000 lines. A further
540,000 will be put in this year and another 8m lines should be in place by
the end of the decade at a cost of up to Dollars 1.5bn a year. This will
increase the number of telephones per 100 inhabitants to 20, according to
Privatisation Ministry estimates.
Yesterday Mr Plehwe warned that Siemens' investment in Poland would only
prove successful if the government sticks to its development plans. However,
the German group has the right to cut its investment commitment in ZWUT and
Elwro if the telephone authorities fail to provide the contracts on the
scale at present envisaged.
Foreign suppliers of telecommunications equipment to Poland have been told
they must produce locally half of the product to be supplied. They must also
purchase state sector companies if they are to have a share of the domestic
market.
Financing for TPSA's investment programme has come from a Dollars 200m World
Bank loan as well as the European Investment Bank and commercial credits
raised by suppliers.

bid for Paramount

BERTELSMANN, the German media group, has denied any intention to bid for
Paramount, the Hollywood-based film group, after reporting a 16 per cent
increase in net profit for the year ended June.
But the company said it was continuing discussions with Paramount and with
other US media groups with a view to smaller acquisitions in individual
divisions.
The privately-owned German group had been rumoured as a potential buyer for
Paramount because of its healthy financial position and its desire to expand
in the electronic media field.
The group has repaid all its debt and has accumulated liquid funds totalling
DM425m.
Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said Paramount was 'too expensive' and
that such a 'grandiose investment was beyond imagination'. He stressed that
it would be incompatible with Bertelsmann's conservative investment
approach.
Group operating profits for the year grew by 20 per cent to DM1.43bn on
sales 6.5 per cent higher at DM17bn. Net income was DM660m.
Bertelsmann achieved its highest growth in its music division which includes
the Arista Records company of the US. Sales for the division, which accounts
for a third of total, turnover rose 13 per cent to DM4.42bn.
Gruner + Jahr, the second-largest division which comprises newspapers and
magazines, recorded a 4 per cent rise in sales to DM3.75bn. Book clubs, with
23m subscribers worldwide, continued to show good results.
Sales of the printing and manufacturing division were down 3 per cent to
DM2.99bn, mainly due to a fall in the price of paper.
In electronic media, gratifying results came from RTL, the largest private
channel in Germany.
But Vox, the private television venture featuring a mix of news and general
programmes and launched at the beginning of the year was disappointing. A
new design for Vox is planned for November.
Premiere, the only pay-TV channel in Germany, was due to break even this
autumn, the company said.
Bertelsmann stressed it had achieved particularly good results in the US
with Bantam Doubleday Dell, the publishing group reporting profits for the
year.
Mr Wossner said the current business year would be more difficult because of
the general recession, but results similar to those recorded in 1992-93
could be expected.

FFr342m (Dollars 60m).
The company said the downturn reflected the weakness of the European
construction and property sectors but forecast that full-year net profits
would be higher than the FFr379m achieved in 1992.
The first-half result was achieved on sales of FFr45.1bn, about the same
level as in the corresponding period last year. Exceptional gains fell from
FFr629m to FFr300m between the two periods.
The group's property division continued to suffer, reporting a net loss of
FFr330m compared with a loss of FFr273m in the first half of 1992.
Construction losses increased more sharply, rising from FFr4m in the first
six months of last year to FFr139m this year. The holding and services
division raised net profits from FFr566m to FFr768m.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T will not oppose BT's MCI
share deal

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph said that it would not oppose British
Telecom's plan to take a 20 per cent stake in MCI Communications, AT&amp;T's
main rival in the US long distance telephone market.
However, it simultaneously urged the Federal Communications Commission,
which governs the industry, to bring in new rules to ensure that before a
foreign carrier was allowed to operate in the US market, US carriers must
have comparable access to the foreign carrier's market within a reasonable
period - two years as a rule of thumb.
The move came in response to an MCI filing with the FCC seeking confirmation
that the BT deal conforms to commission regulations. BT agreed in June to
take a one-fifth stake in MCI for Dollars 4.3bn.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is considering an application
from AT&amp;T for a licence to gain direct access to the UK public
telecommunications network.
Mr Alex Mandl, chief executive of AT&amp;T's communications services group, said
that 'in the absence of any comprehensive rules, the FCC is allowing
foreign-based carriers to enter the wide-open US market while American
carriers are often kept out of the home market of these foreign companies'.
In a separate filing with the FCC, AT&amp;T also urged the commission to end the
company's designation as the 'dominant' carrier in the US and treat it like
other long-distance companies.
AT&amp;T, which at one time had a virtual monopoly of the long-distance segment,
now accounts for around 60 per cent of the US market. which was thrown open
to full competition in 1984.
Because of its dominant carrier status, the company's actions face greater
scrutiny by the FCC than its smaller rivals, for example requiring it to
notify the commission in advance of new services.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg to dispose of Munksjo
stake

<TEXT>
TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday said it intended
to sell a 70 to 75 per cent stake in its Munksjo paper and packaging unit
via a stock market listing.
The disposal is in line with the group's strategy to cut its debts by SKr3bn
(Dollars 369m) over 12 months and to focus activities on its mining, metals
and rubber operations. Analysts have valued Munksjo, which has annual sales
of SKr3bn and is profitable, at between SKr1.5bn and SKr2bn.
The sale is part of a broader drive to strengthen the group's financial
position, which has been squeezed by falling metals prices. It has announced
a SKr1.1bn rights issue and plans to sell its remaining shares in Svedela,
the mineral processing and transport unit. In the first half the group
incurred a SKr796m loss after financial items.
Munksjo has six main divisions, comprising hygiene products, packaging,
speciality papers, envelopes, valves, and pulp. Trelleborg has effectively
been seeking a buyer for the unit since the end of 1991, when it was first
consolidated into the company's accounts, but the slump in the worldwide
pulp and paper market has made it a difficult task.
Trelleborg has net debts of about SKr10bn and has already sold assets worth
SKr1.4bn this year.
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday agreed to buy a
group of companies within the Teli industrial unit of Telia, the Swedish
state-owned telecommunications operator. Ericsson will supply an AXE
switching system worth more than SKr1bn to Telia as part of the accord.
Ericsson said the acquisition would give it additional technical expertise,
new products, increased volumes and a greater production capacity in Sweden.

industry

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Communications Commission yesterday set in motion the creation
of a new multi-billion dollar US wireless communications industry when it
laid down rules for the auction of licences to operate personal
communications services (PCS) networks.
PCS is a form of wireless communications similar to the cellular telephone
industry which has flourished in western nations in the past decade and
involves calls being passed between radio relay stations, or 'cell sites',
scattered across a city. PCS, with advanced digital technology and greater
density of cell sites, should allow users to get clearer calls on more
lightweight, lower-powered receiving sets. Many analysts believe the
technology will usher in an age of genuinely mobile telephony, with
individuals able to carry a tiny receiver at all times.
For the first time in its history, the FCC is to grant radio licences for
the new service by auction rather than through lotteries or hearings on the
merits of applicants. The Clinton administration estimates this could raise
Dollars 10bn.
A controversial issue in the months leading up to yesterday's ruling was the
extent to which the commission would favour large, existing telephone
companies or encourage new entrants to the industry.
Mr James Quello, FCC chairman, said he believed the plan struck a balance
which would allow existing cellular carriers and mostly smaller new
businesses to succeed in PCS.
By a two-to-one vote, the Commission said it would set aside 160MHz of space
in the radio spectrum for PCS - four times as much as for cellular - with
120MHz going to licenced carriers and 40MHz for unlicenced use.
It would allow up to seven licences in each PCS market, with two for larger
carriers and five for smaller ones. Firms would be able to bid for four
10MHz bands, one 20MHz band and two 30MHz ones.
Existing cellular carriers would be able to bid on 10 MHz of the spectrum in
their current markets and for any amount outside areas where they had
cellular operations.
Mr Craig McCaw, chairman of McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest
cellular service company in the US, applauded the ruling, saying that the
decision to issue licences of varying size to both experienced providers and
new entrants would ensure a wide variety of services at competitive prices.

SHARES in Anheuser-Busch, the US brewery and food group, slid in New York
yesterday morning after the company announced that it would post a loss in
the third quarter as a result of a one-time pre-tax charge of Dollars 565m.
The company said the provision, which works through at about Dollars 1.26 a
share, would cover the cost of implementing a package of 'significant
organisational and operational changes'. In the third quarter of 1992,
Anheuser-Busch posted net income of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 1.12.
The announcement, which had come after the close of the New York Stock
Exchange on Wednesday, triggered a sharp reaction when the market opened
yesterday, with the share price falling Dollars 2 to Dollars 43 5/8 in early
trading.
In the most prominent feature of the plan, the company will reduce salaried
staff by 10 per cent, or about 1,200 workers, by the end of next year.
It said it hoped to achieve the cuts primarily through attrition and an
early retirement package to be offered to employees aged 53 or older.

European parts maker

<TEXT>
MAGNA International, the Toronto-based automotive parts supplier, plans to
expand its European operations by investing about CDollars 100m (USDollars
76m) in an unidentified parts manufacturer.
Magna said yesterday that it was in talks which may result in it buying a
majority interest in an operating unit of the European group, and a minority
stake in a public company within the same group. It is also investigating
several other potential investments in Europe.
Magna officials declined yesterday to identify their target, beyond saying
that it is a large company. But Magna has a history of close co-operation
with German car and parts makers. It already has a 50 per cent stake in a
joint venture with Voest-Alpine of Austria which owns four parts factories
in Germany and Austria. Magna owns another factory of its own in Germany.
To finance the proposed acquisition, Magna also announced plans yesterday to
issue 3m common shares in the US and Canada at a price of CDollars 50.50 a
share. The issue will be underwritten in Canada by a group led by Richardson
Greenshields. Bids have been invited from US brokers.
Mr Paul Robinson, senior vice-president for finance, said the thrust into
Europe was prompted partly by potential benefits in the European market, but
also to cement 'stronger relationships with European customers as they move
into North America'. Magna already has contracts to supply BMW's new factory
in South Carolina.
Mr Robinson said the investment will also encourage a 'cross-fertilisation'
of technologies between European and North American auto-parts plants. A
substantial number of Magna's engineers and other senior managers are
Europeans.
Magna has recovered strongly from financial difficulties which pushed it
close to the brink in the late-1980s. It posted record profits of CDollars
140m on sales of CDollars 2.6bn in the year to July 31.
The share price dropped CDollars 1.25 in early trading yesterday on the
Toronto stock exchange to CDollars 52.25.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hermes bucks trend with doubled
earnings
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HERMES, the French luxury goods group, bucked the downward trend in the
troubled luxury industry by almost doubling net profits to FFr54.6m (Dollars
7.1m) in the first half of this year from FFr28.6m in the corresponding
period of last year.
The group, which is still run by the founding Hermes family but this summer
ended more than a century of independence by issuing part of its equity on
the Paris second market, said it had benefited in the first half from strong
sales of leather and silk products, as well as from a reduction in financial
costs.
The news of the sharp increase in Hermes' profits comes at a time when other
luxury companies are under pressure. Gucci, the Italian leather goods group,
is in deep financial difficulty and LVMH, the conglomerate of French
businesses, yesterday reported a fall in interim profits.
Hermes, by contrast, saw sales rise by 8.2 per cent from FFr1.14bn in the
first six months of 1992 to FFr1.23bn at the interim stage this year.
Operating profits increased by 44.7 per cent from FFr102.8m to FFr148.8m
over the same period.
Although the market for Hermes' leather and silk products was buoyant, it
did experience difficulties in its perfume and tableware businesses. Hermes'
finances have been strengthened by an injection of FFr141m following the
flotation.
The group yesterday said that it anticipated 'a slight improvement' in sales
and profits for the rest of the year. However, it cautioned that the outcome
was still uncertain given the volatility of the economic environment and its
dependence on the pre-Christmas sales season.

UNITED Airlines, one of the three biggest US carriers, has reached a
marketing alliance with Emirates, the fast-growing Dubai airline, in a
further move to expand its international network.
United is also close to finalising a wide-ranging commercial agreement with
Lufthansa of Germany, which hinges on the outcome of negotiations in Bonn
this week on a new bilateral aviation agreement between Germany and the US.
The marketing partnership with Emirates will include code-sharing services
from the US to Dubai via London's Heathrow airport.
Code-sharing allows the airlines to use each other's flight identification
code to book passengers in computer reservation systems.
This will enable United to link its flights to Emirates' extensive network
to and from the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent and Asia, with
United's trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific services and its domestic US route
system.
Emirates is launching a second daily service from Heathrow to Dubai next
month, timed to connect with United's trans-Atlantic services.
The proposed partnership between United and Lufthansa would also involve a
code-sharing agreement, giving Lufthansa greater access into the US market
and boosting United's reach into the European market.
Lufthansa has been seeking a strong US partner to strengthen its competitive
position on the North Atlantic. British Airways has already forged a
partnership with USAir, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines with Northwest, and Air
France reached a commercial agreement with Continental Airlines this summer.
The deal, however, has been blocked by the failure so far of the US and
German governments to agree a new aviation deal.
Negotiations have been blocked by German demands for a three-year capacity
freeze on North Atlantic services to and from Germany, and US demands to
allow Northwest the right to extend its North Atlantic services to Amsterdam
on to Germany.

ARGENTINA'S Senate has approved the introduction of a private pension fund
system in an important victory for the economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo,
in his battle to modernise the economy.
The new system, partially modeled on Chile's private pension scheme, offers
contributors a choice between opening individual retirement savings accounts
managed by private companies or remaining in the state-run system. It is
expected to be an important step in the development of Argentina's financial
markets which should allow companies access to long-term domestic capital.
Under the system, employees will pay 11 per cent of wages either to a
privately-managed fund or to a government-run fund. Barings Securities, the
London-based brokers, estimates that the private system will hold assets of
Dollars 30bn by the end of the century.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Ciga, the troubled luxury hotels group controlled by the Aga Khan,
virtually doubled to L110.1bn (Dollars 69m) in the first half of this year
from L58.9bn.
Interest charges soared to L85.1bn from L46.2bn, partly reflecting the
impact of last year's lira devaluation on borrowings, some of which are in
foreign currencies. Total group debts rose to L1,011bn at the end of June
from L971bn last December.
The deeper losses cast further doubts over the future of the group, which is
still waiting for the release of a rescue plan by Mediobanca, the Milanese
merchant bank. Ciga has stopped paying interest on most of its loans, while
the Aga Khan earlier this year said he was unlikely to devote more of his
personal resources.
Group turnover fell 10 per cent to L209.2bn, in spite of a 10 per cent rise
in occupancy levels at Ciga's Italian hotels, which form the bulk of its
chain. The company attributed much of the decline to last year's sale of a
Sardinian supermarkets chain and lower occupancy levels at its non-Italian
hotels.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais chairman
confirms talk of resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEAN-YVES Haberer, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank,
yesterday confirmed speculation that he was considering leaving the bank for
a new post in the financial sector.
He warned that the loss-making group would not be ready for privatisation
for two years.
The chairman's comments, made shortly after he announced an interim net loss
of FFr1.05bn (Dollars 185.2m) against a net profit of FFr119m in the first
half of 1992, follows weeks of speculation about his position at Credit
Lyonnais.
Mr Haberer, who has pursued a controversial expansion strategy in his five
years as chairman, said he had been 'sounded out about another post'.
However, he was not sure whether he was the only candidate. 'I'm thinking
about it,' he said.
The French press recently tipped Mr Haberer as a likely successor to Mr Yves
Lyon-Caen as chairman of the Credit National banking group. Mr Jean
Peyrelevade, chairman of the Union des Assurances de Paris insurance group,
has been mooted as the next chairman of Credit Lyonnais.
France's new centre-right government has already appointed Mr Michel
Pebereau as chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the other leading
state-controlled French bank, to orchestrate its share sale this autumn.
Credit Lyonnais is scheduled for sale later in the privatisation programme.
However, Mr Haberer yesterday said Credit Lyonnais needed 'to improve its
financial position' before it would be suitable for sale to the private
sector.
The group, which last year fell into the red with a net loss of FFr1.8bn,
has been badly affected by the French recession. It has made heavy
writedowns on the bad loans left by Mr Haberer's aggressive lending policy.
Despite the sluggish state of the banking market, Credit Lyonnais raised net
banking income to FFr27.71bn at the interim stage this year from FFr24.45bn.
Operating costs and depreciation, however, rose to FFr20.74bn from
FFr17.76bn, and the group was forced to increase net provisions to FFr7.33bn
from FFr6.26bn.
Mr Francois Gilles, managing director, said Credit Lyonnais expected to
maintain high provisions on its corporate loans during the second half of
the year.
However, he was confident of an improvement in the second half due to lower
operating expenses and anticipated cuts in short-term interest rates,
particularly in France.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Back in the hunt for
acquisitions - Etienne Davignon, La Generale chairman, speaks to Andrew Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After four years of retrenchment and cost-cutting, Societe Generale de
Belgique may be back in the market for acquisitions.
Yesterday, the group agreed to sell its 43 per cent stake in CBR, the
Belgian cement company, to Heidelberger Zement of Germany for BFr22.5bn.
This is not money which will be frittered away on small investments, or used
as a cushion against economic bad times.
Instead, Viscount Etienne Davignon, the group's ebullient pipe-smoking
chairman, says he can now back up his well-known eloquence with hard cash,
by giving subsidiaries - or the group itself - the ability to make large
acquisitions.
According to Mr Davignon, La Generale can fulfil what he always said was its
ideal role: that of a professional investor, actively participating in the
strategy of its portfolio companies.
Much has changed since the early 1980s, when La Generale's lordly demands on
its subsidiaries led to frequent grumbles from Brussels about autocratic or
bureaucratic management by the 'Vielle Dame', ensconced in her Brussels
headquarters.
La Generale now claims it operates with a lighter touch - only 45 staff at
the holding company are directly concerned with the surveillance of the
subsidiaries. However, it is still a complex operation for outsiders to
understand.
La Generale, itself 61 per cent-owned by Compagnie Suez of France, has been
weathering deep recession at the head of a portfolio of highly-cyclical
stocks, including Union-Miniere, Arbed, and CBR. Between 1989 and 1992 net
profits dropped from BFr20.1bn to BFr6.22bn, after extraordinary items.
Suez, which rescued La Generale from the aggressive advances of Mr Carlo De
Benedetti in 1988, was said to be disappointed, and keen for La Generale to
dump some of its smokestack stocks. Many Belgian observers claimed the jewel
in the country's economy had been sold to Paris.
This suggestion that La Generale is not in charge of its own destiny
particularly riles Mr Davignon, a former EC commissioner and one of
Belgium's most prominent businessmen.
Suez's relationship with La Generale, he says, is much less active than that
of La Generale with its holdings.
And he adds that the Belgian group would have started to reduce the impact
of cyclical industrial stocks on its results, with or without the influence
of Suez.
Yesterday's sale of CBR was only the latest in a series of moves to cut La
Generale's exposure to the cycles of heavy industry.
This year alone, the group has reduced its stake in Union Miniere, the
metals company, from 80 per cent to 75 per cent, and is looking to sell down
to 50 per cent. The impact of the company's 25 per cent stake in Arbed, the
Luxembourg steelmaker, has been completely eliminated from the results
through a typically complex deal with the Luxembourg government.
On the positive side, the group has increased its stake in Generale de
Banque, Belgium's largest bank, and is eyeing the possibility of bringing
Accor, the French hotels and tourism group, into the consolidated accounts.
Services companies seemed to have a stronger influence on yesterday's
interim results.
As Mr Gerard Mestrallet, chief executive, pointed out, for the first time in
many years the group's operating results are edging in the opposite
direction from those of Union Miniere - that is, upwards.
At the same time, a services company - albeit an industrial one, electricity
and gas utility Tractebel - has overtaken the metals group as La Generale's
weightiest holding.
However, many analysts believe the group has not yet answered the
fundamental question: what is a holding company for in a turbulent
international economy?
Several brokers suggest investors seeking recovery stocks would be better
advised to buy shares in the industrial companies themselves, rather than
the lumbering giant which oversees them.
La Generale's management is unapologetic. If nothing else, Mr Davignon says,
the holding company provides the stability for those industries to grow.
As Mr Mestrallet pointed out: 'We are not a unit trust, with a spread of
minority participations. We're a diversified group with interests in
services and industry.'
Mr Davignon adds that La Generale provides the stability for those
industries to grow. 'We have moved away from the parochialism of the past,
when Generale's horizon was Belgium,' he said.
'But what we have kept is this idea that it's not stupid, not disgraceful to
be more than a financial holding company which swaps its investments every
time an opportunity comes up.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Swissair reveals loss in report
on merger

<TEXT>
SWISSAIR, which is in the middle of intense negotiations on co-operation
with three other European airlines, has published consolidated interim
accounts for the first time. They reveal a loss of SFr65m (Dollars 46.1m).
The airline prepared the figures to present to financial analysts. However,
the sensitivity of the negotiations with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines forced the cancellation
of the presentation.
The four airlines were due to sign a memorandum of understanding on the
so-called Alcazar project by the middle of this month. The negotiations,
however, have run into difficulty on three issues: the location of a head
office; the selection of a US partner airline; and the valuations of each
airline.
Also, Austrian is still considering whether or not to ally itself with
Germany's Lufthansa instead of with Alcazar.
Fresh opposition to Alcazar has arisen in the Swiss financial community this
week on the grounds that the proposed shareholdings undervalue Swissair's
financial strength.
Swissair has replied that analysts must take into account two prospective
competitive disadvantages it faces: being outside the EC, and facing
increasingly severe aircraft movement restrictions at its home airport in
Zurich.
Swissair revealed that its flight operations in the first half lost SFr43m,
its hotel business lost SFr22m, and its catering and other activities were
at break-even. Last month, it reported a first-half parent company loss of
SFr125m. This suggests it made about SFr60m on aircraft sales.
The consolidated balance sheet at June 30 showed total assets of SFr9.19bn,
financed by SFr2.8bn of shareholders' funds and SFr5.6bn of debt.
Swissair said it continued to hope to break even in the full year.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Falling champagne sales hit
earnings at LVMH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LVMH, the French luxury goods group and a leader in the troubled champagne
industry, yesterday cautioned of a fall in net profits for 1993.
The warning followed the announcement of a 28 per cent fall in interim
profits, from FFr1.29bn (Dollars 228m) in the first half of 1992 to FFr935m
in the same period this year.
The group, which owns some of France's most prestigious brand names -
including Hennessy cognac, Louis Vuitton luggage, and a 24 per cent stake in
the Guinness drinks group - saw its shares fall 4.1 per cent to FFr3,924
following the announcement.
Mr Bernard Arnault, who became chairman of LVMH in one of the fiercest
takeover fights of the 1980s, this summer warned of a slightly smaller fall,
of 25 per cent, in interim profits. He had also hoped the group would be
able to maintain profits for the full financial year.
The situation in the champagne sector has since deteriorated. LVMH yesterday
confirmed it had lost FFr100m on its champagne business during the first
half, and that its contribution from the Guinness stake had fallen 26 per
cent due to sterling's weakness against the French franc.
As a result, it said, it was 'unlikely' to achieve the same level of profits
in 1993 as last year.
Ms Joanna Clapp, an analyst at Hoare Govett, forecast a fall in LVMH's net
profits, from FFr3bn in 1992 to FFr2.73bn this year.
'There should be a pick-up in earnings next year,' she said. 'But the
improvement will be for technical reasons, such as lower restructuring and
financial costs and the impact of stronger sterling on the conversion of the
Guinness contribution. Trading will still be difficult.'
The group saw total sales rise from FFr9.68bn in the first half of 1992 to
FFr10.03bn at the interim stage this year. However, the tough trading
climate and adverse exchange rates took a toll on operating profits, which
slipped from FFr2.35bn to FFr2.03bn.
The main area of difficulty for LVMH was wine and spirits, where pressure on
the profitability of its cognac sales in Japan added to problems in the
champagne sector. The drinks division's operating profits fell from
FFr1.26bn to FFr867m between the two first halves, on sales down from
FFr4.44bn to FFr4.36bn.
The luggage business mustered an increase in operating profits, from FFr890m
to FFr968m, on sales of FFr2.33bn against FFr2.43bn. Perfumes and cosmetics
were affected by heavy promotional expenditure. This was in spite of the
momentum of recent launches, notably Christian Dior's Dune and Givenchy's
Amarige.
Operating profits slipped from FFr330m to FFr326m on sales up from FFr2.54bn
to FFr2.86bn.

<TEXT>
NET consolidated profits at Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest
holding company, slipped to BFr4.37bn (Dollars 125m) in the first half of
1993 from BFr4.47bn last time.
The company claimed, however, it was already reaping the benefits of its new
strategy aimed at reducing exposure to cyclical industrial stocks.
Before exceptional gains, it pushed up profits slightly, to BFr3.67bn from
BFr3.65bn, on turnover of BFr91.9bn against BFr104bn.
As part of the strategy, La Generale yesterday announced the sale of its 43
per cent stake in CBR, the Belgian cement company, to Heidelberger Zement of
Germany. The BFr22.5bn proceeds will be held in readiness for acquisitions
by subsidiaries, or by the group itself.
The main contributors to the holding company's profit in the first half were
Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, with a profit of BFr1.23bn
against BFr1.31bn last time, and Groupe AG - the Belgian part of Fortis, the
Dutch-Belgian financial services group - with BFr579m against BFr525m.
La Generale was also helped by a return to profit at Recticel, the Belgian
chemicals group. Recticel announced yesterday a consolidated net profit of
BFr40m in the first half of 1993, compared with a BFr279m loss in the
equivalent period.
The holding company, which owns 74 per cent of Recticel, benefited from
BFr94m of Recticel's operating profits in the first half, against a loss of
BFr43m in the first half of 1992.
La Generale warned yesterday the economic climate was unlikely to improve in
the second half of 1993, and that the group's industrial companies would
continue to suffer from the uncertain market situation.
However, its service companies would make 'a positive contribution' to
full-year results.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Parkdean Leisure lifts holiday weeks sold
by 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARKDEAN Leisure, the holiday park operator which is coming to the stock
market next month, increased the number of holiday weeks sold in its parks
in the 1993 summer season by 7 per cent, with caravan and retail sales
rising by a smaller percentage.
The figure was revealed in the group's pathfinder prospectus which was
issued yesterday to institutional investors at the start of its marketing
campaign for its share placing to such investors.
The placing is expected to raise about Pounds 8m and value the company at
between Pounds 13m and Pounds 15m.
The prospectus shows that Parkdean's operating profits have risen from
Pounds 789,000 in the year to November 1990 to Pounds 1.3m in 1992. A profit
forecast for the current year will be contained in the final prospectus.
Parkdean incurred an operating loss of Pounds 439,000 in the six months to
June 2, but said the seasonality of the holiday business meant a loss in the
first half was normal.
The prospectus also reveals that Parkdean has appointed Mr Ralph Iley as
non-executive chairman. Mr Iley, formerly a managing director of Cookson
Group is still a non-executive director of Cookson.
The placing is intended to enable Parkdean to repay debt, which amounted to
nearly Pounds 6m in the 1992 balance sheet, and give it a capital base from
which it can expand.
The company says it believes it can increase the number of parks under
ownership and management from the current seven, without a significant
increase in central overheads. No acquisitions are under consideration at
present.
Parkdean also believes it can increase profits from acquisitions. The
document says that operating profits from its Grannie's Heilan' Hame holiday
park, bought in 1989, rose 70 per cent between 1990 and 1992.
Of the group's turnover of Pounds 8.51m in 1992, 41 per cent came from
hiring caravans, chalets and apartments and from touring charges for
caravans and tents; 14 per cent came from sales of caravans and chalets and
45 per cent from retail activities such as bars, amusement arcades and
shops.
The prospectus says the group's fortunes depend on high occupancy rates
which lead to high retail income; in the 1992 season this was 77 per cent.
Pricing is expected on October 6. The sponsor is Charterhouse Tilney.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Britannia improves to Pounds 28.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH it had to make heavier provisions in the first half of 1993,
Britannia Building Society, the ninth largest in the UK, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds 16.8m to Pounds 28.5m.
Gross lending was 13 per cent up on the same period last year and ahead of
expectations in volume and market share, said Mr John Heaps, managing
director.
Provisions for losses on loans and advances were up Pounds 7.7m to Pounds
21.8m, but were offset by an increase in net income from Pounds 83.3m to
Pounds 100.2m, and a reduction of Pounds 2.5m in management expenses.
Net income comprised Pounds 76.1m (Pounds 62.5m) net interest receivable and
Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 20.8m) other income, including insurance sales and
estate agency.
Provisions for non-performing loans amounted to Pounds 34.1m, equivalent to
47.4 per cent of the total mortgage loss provision of Pounds 71.9m for 1992.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Halifax turns in 29% advance to Pounds 411m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX, the UK's biggest building society, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up 29 per cent to Pounds 411m in the six months to July 31 this
year.
It said the increase reflected its decision to concentrate on quality
lending, prudent provisioning and control of costs.
Mr Michael Blackburn, chief executive, said: 'This is a further good set of
results. They are what they are: very strong.'
Gross lending fell to Pounds 3.9bn compared with Pounds 4.6bn in the first
half of last year, and net lending declined to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 2.2bn).
Net interest received rose to Pounds 739m (Pounds 611m) and other income and
charges increased slightly to Pounds 186m (Pounds 180m). Management expenses
rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 358m (Pounds 338m).
Provisions increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 156m (Pounds 135m), but
additional suspended interest - or interest payments written off - almost
halved to Pounds 18m (Pounds 37m).
The number of mortgages at least one year in arrears fell to 21,100
(23,600), or to Pounds 235m (Pounds 320m) by value. That represented a
reduction in arrears as a proportion of total mortgages to 0.44 per cent
(0.63 per cent).
Mr Blackburn warned that the housing market was 'anaemic' but said: 'The
worst is past. We are optimistic that there may be a few red corpuscles
coming through.'
He said applications for new mortgages were at about the same level as last
year, which had been distorted by the government's temporary suspension of
stamp duty.
The Halifax's market share of mortgage lending fell back to 15 per cent from
an unusually high 19 per cent in the first half last year, but its share of
liquid savings almost doubled from 9 per cent to 16 per cent.
The balance sheet was strengthened, with the gross capital ratio rising to
6.69 per cent (6.02 per cent). 'We are in a very strong position to take
advantage of the recovery when it comes,' Mr Blackburn said.
The net interest margin rose to an annualised 2.32 per cent for the half
year from 2.04 per cent, which he said partly reflected a move from the
previous Halifax emphasis of 'favouring the saver at the expense of the
bor-rower'.
In line with the practice of a number of other companies in recent months,
the Halifax had its figures examined by KPMG Peat Marwick, its auditors,
although such an inspection is not required. 'We want to be at the forefront
of best practice,' said Mr Blackburn.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Anglia TV up 13p on 'very good' results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM pre-tax profits at Anglia Television tumbled 59 per cent, from a
restated Pounds 5.18m to Pounds 2.12m, in the first period of operation
under its new franchise.
However, Sir Peter Gibbings, chairman, said the accounts this time were not
strictly comparable with last year as they included payment to the Treasury
of Pounds 12.2m. This represented part of the Pounds 17.8m franchise bid and
7 per cent of the qualifying advertising revenue for the period. The
comparable levy last year was Pounds 732,000.
'The results in the light of that are really very good,' he claimed. The
shares moved up 13p to 375p.
Total revenues for the first half of 1993 were Pounds 61m (Pounds 67.6m). Of
this, programme sales were down from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 9.79m, and
advertising and other revenues amounted to Pounds 51.2m, against Pounds
54.7m.
It was stressed, however, that these were not comparable as, under the new
franchise, the company no longer sold airtime for Channel 4 but was in
direct competition with it.
Sir Peter said the company expected to take about 53 per cent of its annual
advertising revenue in the second half. While this was difficult to
forecast, the third quarter was developing in line with the first half, when
Channel 3 revenue grew by 7 per cent.
He estimated that Anglia's share had risen by 0.3 per cent, giving it well
over 7 per cent of the total.
Operating profits were Pounds 635,000 (Pounds 4.2m). The latest pre-tax
figure includes Pounds 809,000 of goodwill arising from a joint venture with
Home Box Office, a division of Time-Warner, and Pounds 676,000 (Pounds
970,000) from investment income and interest.
Earnings per share fell from 7.76p to 3.38p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 2.86p but the company said it would be considering an increase
in the final.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Automotive boost for Ricardo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICARDO GROUP, the engineering consultancy where top management changed last
year after a boardroom upheaval, reported pre-tax profits up 31 per cent,
from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 2.67m, for the year to end-June.
Sir Philip Foreman, chairman, said the new team had carried out the
commitment made a year ago to do better for shareholders, in spite of
continuing economic difficulties in its business sectors.
The group now operates three divisions - automotive, aerospace, and a mainly
nuclear-based high technology consultancy.
Mr Christopher Ross, chief executive, said the automotive division had been
the group's main strength.
The division carries out work for Japanese, US and EC carmakers on exhaust
emissions, noise, fuel economy and performance, and now numbers four of the
six German carmakers among its customers.
The group had transferred its thinking in the automotive sector to its other
divisions over the past year, he said, moving into more high margin, added
value work.
Customers included Rolls-Royce and Airbus, and the group had won a big
contract from Shorts of Belfast for work on a new executive Lear jet.
Operating profits were ahead 69 per cent at Pounds 4.14m (Pounds 2.44m) on
turnover up 15 per cent at Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 51.9m).
Total group turnover of Pounds 65.6m (Pounds 57.6m) included Pounds 5.59m
from discontinued operations. This reflected the contribution from Ricardo
Technical Communications, the group's publishing division, sold in June.
Exceptional items amounted to Pounds 967,000, including a Pounds 300,000
write-off of goodwill on the disposal and a Pounds 650,000 property
write-down.
The group said it had maintained a strong balance sheet in spite of Pounds
5.4m of capital expenditure, Pounds 2.6m of depreciation and Pounds 1.6m of
research and development costs.
Net borrowings at the end of the year were Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.6m) and
gearing was 15 per cent (12 per cent).
Earnings per share were 4.2p (3.6p).
The proposed final dividend is 3.8p for an unchanged total of 5.7p.

DONELON TYSON, the Cheshire-based building and civil engineering company,
reported pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30 sharply reduced at
Pounds 439,000, against Pounds 1.02m.
The company said that apart from private housing the 'much talked about
recovery has not evidenced itself across the construction sector'. The
company continued to operate in very competitive markets.
Turnover rose Pounds 1.63m to Pounds 34.5m. Net interest payments fell from
Pounds 663,000 to Pounds 125,000. Earnings per share came out at 0.66p
(1.55p).
The directors said that for the rest of the year while the company continued
to benefit from the spread of its activities the core construction
businesses would have to continue to contend with difficult markets in the
year ahead.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: QSP shares fall on 37% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based accounting
software company slipped sharply below budget in its first six months after
going public in March this year. The shares fell 36p to 528p.
Profits before tax for the six months to end-June were Pounds 143,000
compared with Pounds 227,000, a decline of 37 per cent. Turnover rose 10 per
cent to Pounds 6.61m (Pounds 6m).
Earnings per share were 2.1p basic and 2p fully diluted, against 3.9p and
3.2p respectively. No interim dividend is proposed but a final is planned.
Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, explained that the costs of developing QSP's new
Universal Olas accounting package had proved higher than expected, while a
number of customers had held back from further investment in the traditional
Olas system in anticipation of the new product, depressing budgeted results
by about Pounds 1.5m. There were also budgeted costs of about Pounds 850,000
in preparation for the market exploitation of Universal Olas.
The core general ledger module was released earlier in the year and sales
and purchase ledger modules are expected in November. The extra expenditure
was incurred in modifying Universal Olas to run on a broad range of computer
designs. Mr Mordain said it is now the most open accounting system
available.
Analysts expect profits before tax of about Pounds 0.5m for the year. The
share price continues to be supported by expectations that the company will
return pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.8m in 1994 as orders for Universal
Olas pick up.
Mr Mordain said he expected the some 50 customers for the system by the end
of next year, compared with four at present.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Norman Hay losses increase to Pounds
677,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reflecting the continuing impact of moving the Heathrow operations to
Coventry and of recession, which reduced volumes and margins, Norman Hay,
the engineering group, suffered higher pre-tax losses of Pounds 677,000 for
the first half of 1993, against Pounds 393,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 3.9m for the six months to June 30
while operating losses came to Pounds 525,000 (Pounds 454,000). The pre-tax
figure was after interest payable of Pounds 152,000 against receivable of
Pounds 61,000.
Losses per share amounted to 4.5p (1.8p) and again there is no interim
dividend - last year the final was omitted also.
The directors stated that the decision to cease unprofitable processes - Hay
is involved in processing, coating and finishing metals and plastics - would
have a severe impact on results for 1993, but future benefits were to
stabilise group trading position.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors ahead 16% to Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE extremely tough market conditions in all sectors of the business,
Dagenham Motors Group increased pre-tax profit by 16 per cent, from Pounds
1.13m to Pounds 1.3m, in the first half of 1993.
This London and south-east Ford main dealer saw new car sales volume rise 9
per cent, used car sales 7 per cent and commercial vehicles 69 per cent.
Backed up by after-sales activities ahead 15 per cent, total turnover
advanced 12 per cent to Pounds 84.9m (Pounds 75.6m).
Mr David Philip, chairman, said heavy price reductions, lower interest
rates, and an improvement in the market place contributed to the increase in
new car sales.
The loss-making dealerships in 1992 at Enfield and Stevenage made a positive
contribution and continued to show encouraging signs of improved
profitability, the company said.
The security division again increased its contribution but that was partly
offset by lower profits at Brownings as a result of more pressure on
margins.
On the outlook, Mr Philip said the group had the opportunity to achieve
substantially better results than in the same period last year, provided
there was no repeat of the difficult trading conditions experienced in the
latter part of 1992.
Earnings per share came to 5p (4.4p) and the interim dividend is again
1.75p.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Murray Ventures lags benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MURRAY VENTURES, an investment trust that aims to produce capital and income
growth through investment primarily in medium-sized management buy-outs and
capital financings, announced a total return on net assets of 26.7 per cent
over the 12 months to July 31.
The outcome compared with a total return for the FT-A All-Share Index of
32.3 per cent.
Net asset value of this Murray Johnston-managed trust was 346.6p per share,
a rise of 21 per cent over the year, again underperforming the FT-A
All-Share index, which rose 26.7 per cent.
Directors described the performance as 'creditable' given the delayed impact
of recovery on smaller companies' trading.
Unlisted investments realised during the year amounted to Pounds 12.8m,
including the flotations of Yorkshire Food and Stagecoach. Investments
totalled Pounds 2.9m and included Telephone Media and Poole Pottery.
Available revenue amounted to Pounds 3.07m (Pounds 3.02m) for earnings of
12.4p (12.2p) per share.
The proposed final dividend goes up to 7.5p bringing the total for the year
to 10.9p (10.3p).

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wembley doubles to Pounds 2.89m - Profit
from disposal of investments behind advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEMBLEY, owner of the north London stadium complex and greyhound tracks,
more than doubled first-half profits to Pounds 2.89m, but only after the
sale of investments.
Profits from continuing operations fell from Pounds 8.02m to Pounds 6.11m
with the main stadium and the smaller Arena both hosting fewer events and US
greyhound operating profits falling 63 per cent.
Group pre-tax profits, including the Pounds 5.6m surplus from the sale of
shares in the Ticketing Group and Autotote, rose from Pounds 1.07m to Pounds
2.89m after an interest bill of Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 7.9m). Sales were
marginally higher at Pounds 78m.
Earnings per share were 0.58p compared with losses of 0.43p, but the interim
dividend is passed.
The group made disposals of Pounds 15m in the first half and Sir Brian
Wolfson, chairman, said he expected at least the same in the second half.
But net debt fell by only Pounds 5m to Pounds 139m, leaving gearing at 78
per cent. Wembley reiterated that in line with an agreement with its banks
last year it will cut Pounds 40m from its borrowings by March 31 1994 and
Pounds 50m by the end of that year.
The Wembley complex made an operating profit of Pounds 4.4m, down from
Pounds 4.49m in the same period last year. Sir Brian said the performance
was commendable given that there were no main stadium pop concerts in the
first half, compared with seven in the same period last year, and that the
number of events in the Arena fell by 13 to 53.
Profits from UK greyhound operations, which are for sale, fell 11 per cent
to Pounds 1.24m, hit by evening opening of betting shops.
In the US, the greyhound operating profit fell from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds
580,000 because the Lincoln, Rhode Island, track met stiff competition from
a casino based in Connecticut.
Sir Brian said Lincoln was fighting back and that the Colorado operations
had not been affected.
COMMENT
The boardroom coup against Sir Brian Wolfson may not have materialised. But
the chronically optimistic Wembley chairman is not off the rocks. Asset
sales have trimmed only Pounds 5m from the debt mountain; operating profits
remain uncomfortably dependent on world music stars choosing to tour,
something the recession has persuaded many not to do; and profits at the US
greyhound operation have collapsed just as it was being groomed for sale.
Shareholders can therefore expect more rough water before their shares find
any buoyancy. Nor can they rely on someone providing the finance to back a
hostile bid by disaffected former directors. Though Sir Brian plotted the
course and was at the helm when the group went aground, he can probably
count on support of shareholders representing 25 per cent of the company.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins pleases market with 79% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Travis Perkins gained 30p to close at 275p yesterday after the
timber and building materials merchant reported better than expected
first-half profits, boosted by increased housebuilding.
Pre-tax profits advanced 79 per cent, from a restated FRS 3 adjusted Pounds
5.18m to Pounds 9.31m, in the six months to June 30.
Earnings per share increased from 3.5p to 5.9p and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 2.5p.
The group operates 164 building materials depots and 11 garden centres. Its
profit gain was achieved on turnover 10 per cent higher at Pounds 166.8m
(Pounds 151.6m) and was led by trade sales to housebuilders.
In contrast the secondary market - based on the household repairs,
maintenance and improvement (RMI) business - which usually accounted for 70
per cent of turnover, currently represented only about 65 per cent as home
owners continued to delay projects, said Mr Tony Travis, chairman.
On a like-for-like basis sales volumes grew by 4 per cent in the first half,
inflation added another 2 percentage points and acquisitions accounted for
the remainder of the increase.
A lower cost base and a further improvement in productivity helped boost
trading profits to Pounds 9.09m (Pounds 4.85m). While gross margins remained
under pressure in the 'very competitive trading environment', the level of
the bad debt charge declined further to 0.75 per cent of sales, having
peaked at 1.5 per cent.
Net interest receipts of Pounds 27,000 compared with net interest payments
of Pounds 305,000 in 1992, and mainly reflected substantial cash inflow.
The group ended June with net cash of more than Pounds 9m.
Profits were also helped by a Pounds 195,000 (Pounds 643,000) gain on the
sale of surplus properties; the group has a further 20 properties earmarked
for disposal.
On the outlook Mr Travis said the improvement that began in the second
quarter had continued, but he cautioned that 'consumer confidence in the
housing market is still fragile', and added 'although a recovery is under
way it is not yet firmly established'.
COMMENT
Travis Perkins' performance was substantially better than the market had
been expecting and highlights the management's success in taking out costs
during the recession. As a result even a slight pick-up in volume can have a
dramatic effect on the bottom line. As the recovery in housebuilding begins
to boost confidence the RMI business should also improve. Look for pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 19.5m this year, equivalent to earnings per share of
12p. This is a quality stock but yesterday's price gain means it is trading
on a lofty prospective p/e of almost 23 - it looks much cheaper against a
1995 profits forecast of Pounds 33m, equivalent to 22p per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SLIDE from pre-tax profits of Pounds 202,000 to losses of Pounds 198,000
was announced by Hampden Group for the 24 weeks to June 19.
The USM-quoted group operates Texas Homecare home improvement stores in
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland under a fran-chise agreement
with Home Charm.
It also has a joint venture with Kwik-Fit to operate motor repair centres in
Northern Ireland.
Turnover was marginally down at Pounds 13.9m, against Pounds 14.1m, and the
pre-tax result was after an exceptional Pounds 125,000 relating to the
termination of employment of a former executive director.
Losses per share amounted to 0.89p (earnings 0.91p) and there is no
dividend. Last time there was a payment of 0.2p.
The shares dipped 2p to 29p.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Caverdale to raise Pounds 3.2m through
placing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAVERDALE Group, the motor retailing and industrial consumables concern,
yesterday announced plans to raise a net Pounds 3.17m through a placing and
open offer.
Directors of the Luton-based group said the proceeds would be used to
replenish the cash cost of recent acquisitions and to meet increased working
capital requirements of the enlarged group. Further acquisitions would be
sought, they added.
The placing is of 27.22m new shares at 12 1/2 p, conditionally placed with
institutional and other shareholders by Carr Kitcat and Aitken. Shareholders
are offered a full clawback on a 1-for-6 basis.
Directors said there had been 'no significant change' in the group's
financial or trading position since the interim results were published in
July showing a turnround from losses of Pounds 272,000 to pre-tax profits of
Pounds 663,000.
They also said an early return to the dividend list was 'realistic'.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Antofagasta at Pounds 20.8m after bank
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTOFAGASTA Holdings, which has mining, banking, rail and water interests in
Chile, realised an Pounds 8.25m profit from the merger in June of its Banco
O'Higgins associate with the Spanish-owned CentroHispano Banco and this
boosted pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 from Pounds 8.9m to
Pounds 20.8m.
The group said falling copper prices since February had adversely affected
results but operating profit rose by 39 per cent, from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds
11.6m, thanks to substantial increases in income from associated
manufacturing and banking operations. Antofagasta warned that there was no
indication yet of higher metal prices and that would affect results for the
full year.
Pre-tax profit from mining operations fell from Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 2.1m
on turnover up from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 33.2m.
Total turnover rose to Pounds 40.7m (Pounds 31.9m). Earnings, excluding
exceptionals, rose from 22.1p to 34.4p and an unchanged interim dividend of
6p is declared.
The bank merger reduced Antofagasta's holding in the combined entity from
47.65 per cent to 24.12 per cent.
In March the group also sold a 13.65 per cent interest in the Lince mining
company for Dollars 12.3m (Pounds 7.9m). This reduced Antofagasta's
effective interest from 91.4 per cent to 77.75 per cent and produced a
profit on disposal of Pounds 889,000.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Refocused Harmony Leisure cuts losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HARMONY Leisure, the USM-quoted operator of restaurants, pubs and hotels,
reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 2.13m for the year to
March 28. Turnover fell from Pounds 6.45m to Pounds 5.69m.
The result was after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 2.66m) of
which Pounds 961,000 related to property write-downs. Losses per share were
cut to 8.01p (13.83p).
In his first report to shareholders, Mr John Main, chairman and chief
executive, said that substantial progress had been made in restructuring the
company and refocusing its principal activities. A property investment
division had been formed and the group had now agreed to buy a portfolio of
mixed properties from British Land, Mr Main said, further details of which
would be announced shortly.
In addition, the group had entered negotiations, which, he believed, would
cumulate in the sale of most of its existing pub estate.
The directors are proposing to offer one warrant for shareholders to
subscribe for one ordinary share at 15p each in the years 1994-99 for every
five held.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Margins squeezed as Morrison rises 5.5% -
Food retailing shares dip on second half warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN the food retailing sector took another downward lurch yesterday
after Wm Morrison Supermarkets became the latest company to complain of
falling margins.
The shares closed 23p down at 106p after the Bradford-based retailer said it
seemed unlikely that operating profit would rise in line with sales over the
next year.
The company increased pre-tax profits by 5.5 per cent from Pounds 36.2m to
Pounds 38.2m in the six months to July 31 - below market expectations.
Sales expanded 20 per cent to Pounds 746.5m (Pounds 623.5m), but the group
said this had been achieved only at the expense of a reduction in gross
margins.
J Sainsbury shares yesterday fell 20p to 420p and Tesco's fell from 208 1/2
p to 197 1/2 p.
Earlier this week Tesco said it would break ranks with other food retailers
and fight the growing challenge of discount food retailers by cutting the
price of basic products.
Mr Ken Morrison, chairman, said: 'The current trading scene is one of
ever-increasing price competition and therefore pressure on margins. Cost
controls through good systems and firm management are the order of the day.'
The group said increased labour costs had been incurred to improve service.
Operating margins dropped from 5.8 to 5.2 per cent, leaving operating profit
8 per cent higher at Pounds 39.1m.
Since the end of the half-year, sales had exceeded last year by 18 per cent,
but due to competitive openings like-for-like growth had slipped to about 2
per cent.
Mr Morrison said: 'A very significant factor at work here, of course is the
preference which customers are showing for more economically-priced goods at
the expense of many more expensive branded products.'
He was confident, however, that real growth would come from new stores built
on realistically-priced sites.
During the half year, the group opened five new superstores and has since
opened one at Harrogate, with another due at Bolton in November.
Next year the group plans to open nine new superstores, and will continue to
refurbish existing stores.
To supplement the existing group warehouse at Wakefield, the group said it
planned to invest Pounds 20m in a new distribution centre in Cheshire, which
should be functioning for trading for Christmas 1994.
Earnings per share rose to 3.38p (3.17p) and the interim dividend is
increased to 0.2 (0.16p).

BARINGS, the privately controlled UK merchant banking group, trebled pre-tax
profit from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 35.5m in the first half of 1993.
Last year the group took action to stem heavy losses at Baring Securities,
its trading subsidiary, cutting 108 jobs.
Mr Peter Baring, chairman, said yesterday that the subsidiary had made a
significant recovery following the reduction in both personnel and expenses.
The group's reputation for the quality of its research had been retained.
It had held its leading position in its most important markets of Japan,
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, and continued to grow in other south-east
Asian markets as well as Latin America. Half the group's employees work
outside the UK, with a quarter in the Asian region.
Investment banking had enjoyed generally favourable market conditions in the
period, and Barings had been well-placed to benefit, he said.
Baring Asset Management 'substantially increased' its contribution. Baring
Brothers had 'maintained a high level of activity' although the corporate
finance market had remained relatively quiet.
Mr Baring also said that Dillon Read, the Wall Street investment bank in
which it has a 40 per cent interest, had performed well during the six
months.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pittards shares fall 25%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Pittards fell 15p to 44p yesterday as the leather company reported
a pre-tax loss of Pounds 310,000 for the six months to June 30 and warned of
provisions which could hit the full year result.
Losses compared with profits of Pounds 1.27m last time and followed the
warning at the end of June that profits for the first half would fall short
of expectations.
At that time the directors informed shareholders that a strategic review of
the poorly performing clothing and chamois division was being conducted.
A number of options, both internally and externally, were being considered.
Whatever was decided, it was likely that provisions would need to be made
which could materially affect the outcome for the year.
Turnover for the six months was Pounds 58.5m (Pounds 50.4m). Losses per
share worked through at 2.2p (earnings 3.6p). There is no dividend (0.5p).

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Guinness may be forced to resume pension
payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS, the brewing conglomerate, said it had been advised by actuaries to
its pension scheme that recent tax changes and slower than expected dividend
growth will force it to resume contributions a year or two ahead of
schedule.
As a result, the company will take a charge of roughly Pounds 30m against
second half profits to take account of contributions for the 1994 year.
Guinness thus joins a number of UK companies which have had to resume
pension fund contributions following controversial changes to advance
corporation tax announced last March.
Earlier this year, British Telecom announced it would have to add some
Pounds 800m to its pension fund to compensate for a shortfall caused chiefly
by the tax change and by low dividend increases.
The tax change means ACT paid on dividends which pension funds can reclaim
from the Inland Revenue is reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. The
change has in effect cut the income in UK equity investments for pension
schemes by 6.25 per cent. Over 60 per cent of Guinness' pension scheme
assets are invested in UK equities.
In the year to March 1993, dividends shrank in nominal terms by 1.5 per cent
while the scheme had projected that in real terms, they would grow by nil to
0.5 per cent. Guinness, like most UK pension funds, uses a method of valuing
scheme assets based on the amount of income they are expected to produce
over a long period of time.
Guinness has been enjoying a contributions holiday since 1986. Its scheme
was amalgamated with that of Distillers which it acquired in 1988 and the
actuarial surplus in the combined schemes had been expected, as of the last
valuation in March 1992, to enable the contributions holiday to continue
through 1994 or 1995.
Scheme members will continue paying their current rate, which ranges from
nil to 5.5 per cent of net pay after deductions for National Insurance
contributions, a rate roughly equal to 3 per cent of gross pay.
Although the next valuation is not scheduled to be conducted until March
1995, the actuaries, after consultation with the company, have decided it
would be prudent to resume contributions next year.

FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: How GPA will restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA was much better at managing its aircraft than managing its liabilities.
That sentence sums up not only how GPA got into its current mess, but also
the hope it has to regain some of its shareholders' lost value.
As part of the restructuring plan detailed yesterday, GPA will pass the
management of its assets to a new GE Capital subsidiary. This is an
ingenious method to prevent GE Capital becoming responsible for GPA's
liabilities.
In fact, the same people will operate the business, the new company, GE
Capital Aviation Services, being staffed by GPA employees. And it will be
based at Shannon, in the Irish Republic, as is GPA.
About 160 of GPA's staff will move to GECAS, the remaining 25 will stay with
GPA.
GPA will continue to own the assets, paying GECAS a management fee of 0.43
per cent of the value of the aircraft, and will remain responsible for its
liabilities.
But the 15-year management contract between GPA and GECAS should give
creditors confidence. Even if GPA were to go into liquidation, the
management contract would hold.
If GPA were to raise further cash by securitising aircraft - through
Aircraft Lease Portfolio Securitisation or Alps - investors will have the
comfort of the GECAS management contract.
The deal, if completed, should also make it easier for GPA to make outright
aircraft sales. While GPA's future hung in the balance potential purchasers
held back in the hope of lower prices.
GPA has also cut its order book from Dollars 11.3bn (Pounds 7.3bn) for 242
aircraft to Dollars 3.6bn for 57 aircraft, requiring a Dollars 462m
provision. It has sold one aircraft to GE Capital and agreed to sell a
further 44, which will provide Dollars 465m of cash to GPA.
Even so, as the prospectus for the Dollars 150m issue of convertible and
non-convertible notes says in bold capital letters 'an investment in GPA's
securities is speculative and high risk'. The convertible notes would
represent between 23 per cent and 25 per cent of GPA's capital, and are
being offered to existing shareholders. Subscribers have already been found
for Dollars 129m of the notes, which is understood to be sufficient for the
company's needs.
The company still faces a tough time if it is to cut its debt to a
manageable level. The Dollars 750m of debt deferred now will largely fall
due in September 1996. In the year to March 1997 GPA must repay or refinance
debt of Dollars 2.36bn.
Risk factors outlined in the document include the need to sell aircraft to
meet these debt obligations, its ability to refinance its debts in 1996, and
litigation against the group.
If GPA overcomes these difficulties, GE Capital may decide to exercise its
options. It can buy a near-two thirds stake by March 1988 at a price
determined by the value of GPA's shareholders funds, but will fall between
Dollars 110m and Dollars 165m.
It can then buy any shares created in the restructuring over the next three
years, at a fair market price, and would then make an offer for the rest.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Jamaican purchase to boost stout sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS is to acquire a majority stake in Desnoes &amp; Geddes, the Jamaican
brewer of Red Stripe lager, in a move designed to expand sales of the UK
group's stout throughout the Caribbean.
The group is paying between Pounds 41m and Pounds 45m for a 51-55 per cent
shareholding in the Jamaican brewer, which has brewed and distributed its
stout since 1987.
The Desnoes and Geddes families, and Heineken, the Dutch brewer, will retain
holdings in the company.
Guinness has been exported to the Caribbean since 1818 but sales in Jamaica
 -which accounts for 35 per cent of the English-speaking Caribbean market -
have more than doubled in volume since 1990 to 1.5m cases. The stout now has
a 15 per cent share of total Jamaican beer sales.
The UK group also has a wholly owned subsidiary in Trinidad and the stout is
brewed by associate companies in St Vincent and Grenada.
Mr Brenda O'Neill, managing director of Guinness Brewing Worldwide, said:
'Given D&amp;G's strategic significance in the Caribbean beer market and its
leadership in Jamaica, the Guinness offer represents a logical step in the
regional development of the brand.'
In the year to September 1992, D&amp;G made pre-tax profits of JDollars 347m
(Pounds 10.5m) on sales of JDollars 2.26bn.
Its Red Stripe and Dragon beers, together with Guinness, Heineken lager and
McEwan's ale, which it brews under licence, form a strong brands portfolio.
The company also produces and markets a range of soft drinks and franchises
Pepsi-Cola and Schweppes.
The Guinness deal will not affect D&amp;G's contracts in the UK where Red Stripe
lager is brewed under licence by Charles Wells and distributed by HP Bulmer.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Low banana prices behind fall at Geest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in the price of bananas in Europe was the main factor behind a
largely anticipated pre-tax decline at Geest, the fresh produce and prepared
food group, in the 26 weeks to July 3.
The fall, from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 3.56m came from turnover down from
Pounds 359m to Pounds 333m. The interim dividend is held at 3.7p, uncovered
at this stage by earnings per share down at 3.6p (15.3p).
Mr David Sugden, chief executive, said this reflected the board's confidence
that the downturn was temporary and happened in a period of transition.
Full-year earnings would easily cover the total dividend, he said.
Explaining the pre-tax fall, Mr Sugden said that the expected new European
banana regime, which had been due to be introduced on January 1, was delayed
until July 1, and that even then there had been some slowness in the
granting of licences.
The new regime was now achieving its aim of stabilising prices and enabling
European companies to viably compete with multinationals like Chiquita, Dole
and Del Monte, Mr Sugden said. He estimated that Geest's total EC market
share would rise from 7 per cent to between 12 and 14 per cent.
Group banana sales by volume grew by 40 per cent. In sterling terms banana
sales rose only 7 per cent, though turnover in the whole fresh produce
division fell to Pounds 276.5m (Pounds 285.2m). Operating profits were
Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 11.2m).
On the prepared food side sales on continuing activities grew to Pounds
54.4m (Pounds 38.5m) while operating profits edged ahead to Pounds 3.28m
(Pounds 3.21m).
Group operating profits were Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 14m). Interest receivable
fell to Pounds 255,000 (Pounds 1.29m). Debt at July 3 was Pounds 32.4m.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: AB buy helps TT to Pounds 9.42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the mini conglomerate with most of its interests in electronics,
impressed the City yesterday by lifting pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.47m to
Pounds 9.42m in the six months to June 26, helped by the January acquisition
of AB Electronics.
The interim dividend goes up to 2.6p (2.4p), payable from earnings per share
of 8.2p (7.7p). The company conceded the Pounds 13m acquisition of then
lossmaking AB with Pounds 26m debt, covered interests costs but diluted
earnings.
Mr John Newman, joint chief executive, said AB would give further benefits
next year: 'We are extremely pleased with the way AB has turned out. When we
bought it, it was making losses of about Pounds 10m a year and now it is
trading profitably.'
AB had an operating profit margin of about 1.6 per cent in the first half,
contributing Pounds 1.37m to operating profits of Pounds 11.8m (Pounds
8.8m). TT put in costing systems, stepped back from chasing volume on
unprofitable products and shed about 550 from the 4,000-strong workforce. It
is aiming for a margin of 5 per cent by the end of next year.
Mr Newman said the market was 'very strong in electronics' accounting for
about 80 per cent of group sales, mainly in telecommunications, mobile
phones and computer components. Packaging operations were flat at the
operating level while building services were still 'suffering'.
Interim turnover was Pounds 179.1m (Pounds 78.6m) bolstered by Pounds 78.7m
from AB.
UK customers accounted for 56 per cent of sales. First half exports were
Pounds 29m compared with a full year's Pounds 32m in 1992.
At the half-year end, TT's gearing was 54 per cent (under 20 per cent a year
earlier). Interest charges were Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 1.33m), but the group
received proceeds this month from its Pounds 51.4m rights issue and now has
net cash of Pounds 7.5m.
COMMENT
TT's joint-chief executives, Mr Nicholas Shipp and his Hanson-trained
partner Mr Newman, are its main attraction. They buy sound businesses,
fallen on hard times, turning them around within a year. After consolidation
they then buy another business. AB is the latest in this successful series,
with shareholders readily chipping in new equity to fund it. With AB coming
good quicker than expected, pre-tax profit forecasts have been revised
upwards to Pounds 24m for the full year. This gives a multiple of 15.5 which
looks modest compared with a rating in the low 20s for Wassall, with similar
interests and another Hanson-trained boss.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Birkdale launches second rights issue to
fund buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRKDALE Group, involved in advertising, public relations and marketing, is
making a second rights issue in four months to help pay for an acquisition,
writes Nigel Clark.
It also announced the disposal of Lewis Broadbent, an advertising agency,
and losses for the year to March 31 of Pounds 1.94m (profits Pounds
202,000).
It is issuing 39.6m shares on a 1-for-1 basis at 8p to raise a net Pounds
2.78m. Of that Pounds 1.45m will form the cash element of the initial
payment for M&amp;K Design-In-Store with the balance providing additional
working capital and repay borrowings.
M&amp;K, which provides marketing and design services, is being bought for an
initial Pounds 2.7m and further results-related payments to a maximum Pounds
800,000. The balance of the initial payment will be satisfied in shares.
Birkdale shares fell 2p to 12p.
M&amp;K reported operating profits of Pounds 357,000 (Pounds 460,000) for the
year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 2.23m).
Lewis Broadbent is being sold to Martin Butler Associates for Pounds
127,000, including the repayment of intercompany debt. In the year to March
31 Lewis incurred a loss of Pounds 830,000 on Pounds 1.86m turnover.
Turnover fell from Pounds 21.2m to Pounds 19.7m. Losses per share were 9.7p
(1.5p earnings). The final dividend is passed (0.2p), there being
insufficient distributable reserves.
When the company raised Pounds 1.95m through a placing and open offer in
June it said that the cash element of the M&amp;K purchase would be met from
existing resources. However, the delay in two expected subsidiary sales and
the continuing poor trading conditions resulted in the need for further
strengthening of the balance sheet.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Appleyard calls for Pounds 16.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLEYARD GROUP, the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer, announced a
3-for-10 rights issue yesterday to raise Pounds 16.4m for acquisitions.
The cash call at 120p a share came as the group reported a jump in interim
pre-tax profits and agreed to acquire WSM Motors, a Bristol-based
Mercedes-Benz van and truck dealership for Pounds 1m from Union Traffic. WSM
made operating profits of Pounds 123,000 in the six months to June 30.
Appleyard's shares closed down 2p at 148p yesterday.
Mr John Atkin, business development manager, said that while the proceeds of
the rights issue would initially be used to reduce gearing, the longer-term
aim was to make 'selective and complementary acquisitions.'
The group now has 57 franchises on 39 sites in the north of England and
Scotland but wants to improve the balance of its portfolio and add BMW,
Citroen, Fiat, Honda, Mazda and Toyota marques.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from a restated Pounds
263,000 to Pounds 2.61m on turnover of Pounds 177m (Pounds 158m).
Earnings were 3.9p (0.9p) and the dividend is held at 2.6p.
COMMENT
Appleyard is beginning to benefit from the effects of operational gearing.
After cutting costs a relatively modest 12 per cent increase in turnover
resulted in a 65 per cent improvement in operating profit to Pounds 3.29m.
Overall, the group's return on resources employed has improved from 6.8 per
cent for the 1992 first half to 17.2 per cent in the latest period and the
group now has its sights on a 20 per cent plus return. Appleyard has managed
to squeeze more out of 12 of its existing sites through multi-franchising.
Now the group is planning to expand through acquisitions. Pre-tax profits
this year should reach Pounds 5.2m producing earnings per share of 7.4p and
a prospective p/e of 20.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo ex-chief to receive Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Ernest Mario, former chief executive of Glaxo, the drugs group, will
receive a Pounds 2.7m pay-off over the next three years following his
ousting in March.
The sum, revealed in the annual report published yesterday, is the
largest-ever severence settlement in the UK. The payment generated little
comment among institutional investors.
Dr Mario, who had a three-year rolling contract, will receive his salary of
Pounds 900,000 until June 1996. In addition, he will be paid long-term
performance related bonuses for the next four years. These are based on the
company's earnings per share growth compared with competitors such as Merck
of the US and Wellcome of the UK.
Dr Mario also retains his 526,186 share options which lapse on dates up to
August 22 1996. At yesterday's share price of 642p, they were worth Pounds
3.3m. Dr Mario purchased Pounds 28,842 worth of furniture from Glaxo when he
left.
His remuneration for the year was Pounds 1.32m, which included a bonus of
about Pounds 420,000. Sir Paul Girolami, chairman, received Pounds 1.44m
compared with Pounds 1.19m the previous year.
Dr Mario was ousted by Sir Paul after a boardroom bust-up over Glaxo's
future direction. Dr Mario said he resigned because of differences of
opinion over the running of the business.
Although his Pounds 2.7m payment may appear a great deal for one man, it
will have little impact on the company. The sum is equivalent to 11 hours
worth of sales of Glaxo's best-selling drug, the ulcer treatment Zantac.
During Dr Mario's tenure between May 11 1989 and May 12 1993, Glaxo's share
price rose from 337p to 668p and its market capitalisation increased from
Pounds 10bn to Pounds 20.1bn. It outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index by 50
per cent, and the health and household sector by 12 per cent.
In August, Dr Mario became vice-chairman and chief executive of Alza
Corporation of California.
The company makes drug-delivery systems. If Dr Mario works for a direct
competitor of Glaxo, he loses the right to the Pounds 2.7m payment.

SHARES IN Laura Ashley fell 22p to 87p after the niche clothing and home
furnishings group warned its full year profits would be more than Pounds 7m
below market expectations.
The group reported interim pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.68m to Pounds
1.31m, on sales up 23 per cent at Pounds 144m (Pounds 116.8m). Currencies
accounted for some of this and allowing for that the rise was 13 per cent.
Trading in North America had been slower than the group anticipated in April
resulting in price markdowns in the second half being more than expected.
Taken with one-off costs of Pounds 3m, North America would be responsible
for full year pre-tax profits being lower than the Pounds 10m expected by
the market. Second half pre-tax profits were unlikely to be 'significantly
ahead of the first half.'
The group will be spending a further Pounds 3m for marketing support and
provisions against autumn and winter 1992 stock.
Mr Jim Maxmin, chief executive, said the group's problems were not
structural. 'The strategy in place is working,' he said. He had been
over-optimistic about the timing of the recovery in the US.
UK sales in the first half grew by 19 per cent and in continental Europe by
13 per cent. The 4 per cent rise in the US followed a 30 per cent plunge in
sales in February and early March after bad weather and a decision not to
repeat a large home furnishings promotion.
Earnings per share were 0.22p (0.4p), and the interim dividend is passed.
Gearing rose from 19 per cent to 28 per cent but Mr Maxmin expected a cash
inflow by the year-end.
COMMENT
Much of what Laura Ashley has done, and says it will do, sounds most
convincing. Sales figures are encouraging. The strong brand appears to have
consumer appeal again and the group has put in place control systems which
were woefully lacking last summer and led to the dismal US performance. But
the market was not expecting to hear convincing arguments again, it was
expecting the first signs of results. Yesterday's sharp share price markdown
was a reaction to the postponement of recovery for another year and the
market's waning confidence in management's ability to get to grips with the
US business. The key remains the degree to which Laura Ashley has to mark
down its US prices. At the moment a staggeringly high 70 per cent are being
reduced. Sort this out and the p/e multiple, now more than 100 on a profits
forecast at Pounds 2.7m and earnings of 0.6p, could come crashing down. But
if the mark-down problem is not addressed, Laura Ashley will remain
expensive.

FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: United News to sell Extel Financial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD STEVENS, chairman of United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily and
Sunday Express and the Daily Star, yesterday formally announced for the
first time that he planned to sell Extel Financial, the electronic
information subsidiary.
The asking price for the company, which provides a range of data, news,
company information and investment accounting services, is likely to be in
the Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m range.
The announcement of the long-rumoured sale came as United announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 51.3m for the first six months of 1993, a 10.4 per cent
rise on last time's Pounds 46.5m.
Lord Stevens said that the decision to sell Extel Financial had been taken
because of the increasing investment needs of the financial information
industry. As a result, he added, 'the interests of its customers and staff
could probably best be developed within a larger financial information
business'. The sale will be handled by Veronic Suhler &amp; Associates of New
York.
Last year the business made an estimated profit of Pounds 4.9m on revenues
of Pounds 33m. Extel Financial was part of the Extel Group bought by United
in 1987 for Pounds 250m. Parts of the business such as the Extel Racing
Service were closed soon after and others sold. The segment now being sold
accounted for about 14 per cent of the original purchase.
The Pounds 51.3m pre-tax profit figure for United was in line with City
expectations but Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at stockbrokers
Kleinwort Benson last night described the results as good, particularly the
improved margins on the company's national newspaper titles.
Mr Terrington is looking for Pounds 115m pre-tax for the full year, not
including exceptional items.
Earnings per share rose to 16.9p against 14.2p, an increase of 19 per cent,
while the interim dividend is maintained at 7.5p.
The Pounds 190m proceeds from the July rights issue have been used to reduce
net debt which now stands at Pounds 80m.
Strong advertising revenue and tight control of costs contributed to a 16
per cent profit rise from the national newspapers.

FT  24 SEP 93 / La Generale may use cash from cement sale for acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEIDELBERGER Zement, Germany's largest producer of building materials, has
bought a 43 per cent stake in CBR, the Belgian cement company, triggering a
BFr53bn (Pounds 1bn) offer for the whole company.
If the deal is approved by competition authorities, the merged group will be
the fourth largest building materials company in Europe, with annual
turnover of DM5.23bn (Pounds 2bn).
Heidelberger agreed to buy the stake from Societe Generale de Belgique,
Belgium's largest holding company, which has been trying to reduce its
exposure to cyclical industrial stocks.
Viscount Etienne Davignon, chairman of La Generale, said the cash raised by
the sale of the CBR stake would be held in reserve for possible
acquisitions. 'It's clearly not a cushion (against recession) and we don't
intend to put it into bits and pieces,' he said. Mr Davignon added that
without the additional money, La Generale had been unable to fulfil its
ambition to be an active 'professional investor' in its businesses.
The German group said that it was seeking a majority stake in CBR, but it
wanted to maintain its stock market listing, and allow it to develop as 'an
independently managed Belgian-Dutch company with a large independent
shareholder base'.
The German company is paying BFr22.5bn for La Generale's shares, at
BFr11,750 each. That compares with the price of BFr11,475 at which CBR's
shares were suspended on the Brussels bourse two days ago. The shares
remained frozen yesterday. La Generale's shares fell BFr100 to close at
BFr2,490 and in Frankfurt Heidelberger was suspended at DM1,090. Under
Brussels stock exchange rules, Heidelberger must offer at least BFr11,750 to
other shareholders.
Mr Peter Schuhmacher, Heidelberger chairman, said both companies were
efficient and modern and recent investments would bear fruit immediately.
Heidelberger produces a wider range of building materials than CBR, which
concentrates on cement, aggregates and concrete.
La Generale sees the financial and services sectors as its main source of
profit. The CBR stake accounted for about 9.6 per cent of the value of the
Belgian group's portfolio at end-June.

FT  24 SEP 93 / GPA Group finalises its last chance of survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the Irish aircraft leasing company which has been struggling with
debt of Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.76bn), yesterday finalised plans for a
Dollars 150m capital raising, the granting of options to GE Capital to take
control of the company, and the deferral of Dollars 750m of debt repayments
for three years plus the injection of Dollars 150m of new money.
The deal was largely agreed in May, but the complexity of the documentation
has delayed finalisation until now. It is designed to put the company on a
stable footing, giving it time to reduce debt through aircraft sales within
three years.
Mr Maurice Foley, deputy chairman, who will retire when the deal is
completed but is likely to remain a non-executive director, said 'the deal
is not sufficient on its own but is essential to the survival of GPA.
Without this there certainly isn't a future. There is no other plan behind
this'.
GE Capital is getting an option to buy up to 67 per cent of the company by
March 1998 paying between Dollars 110m and Dollars 165m. For three years
after that it can buy further shares and could take 100 per cent control of
GPA.
GPA will pass the management of its assets to a new GE Capital subsidiary,
GE Capital Aviation Services under a 15-year contract.
Mr Tony Ryan, founder, chairman and chief executive of GPA, and two other
GPA executive directors will be employed by GECAS, leaving GPA. Mr Ryan and
GPA will appoint an arbitrator to fix any compensation he is due for loss of
office at GPA. The other two directors, Mr Colm Barrington and Mr James
King, will not receive compensation but be given equivalent jobs at GECAS.
GPA also revealed that exceptional costs of Dollars 737m relating to the
group's restructuring contributed to an attributable loss of Dollars 993m in
the year to March 1993, cutting the group's net worth from Dollars 1.23bn to
Dollars 234m. Operating profits were Dollars 48m, down from Dollars 262m in
the previous year.
Of the exceptional costs Dollars 130m related to fees for the restructuring,
of which Dollars 44m went to lenders and Dollars 86m to professional
advisers including 22 firms of lawyers. A further Dollars 20m related to the
costs of a flotation aborted in June 1992.
The proposals will be put to shareholders at a special meeting on October
18. Existing shareholders who do not subscribe to the issue of convertible
and non-convertible securities will see their holdings diluted to 10 per
cent.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Battle to defend premium brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are difficult times for producers of deluxe brands of Scotch whisky
and champagne.
The problems of recession in their largest markets worldwide have been
compounded by over-production. Prices have come under pressure from
value-hunting consumers and from cut-price products.
Some investors have begun to question whether consumers will ever again pay
premium prices for a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky or Moet et
Chandon champagne.
'I have absolutely no doubt that as economic conditions improve, consumers
will move back to strong premium brands,' Mr Anthony Greener, Guinness
chairman, said yesterday.
In the US, sales of Johnnie Walker Black Label and Dewar's whiskies were
already beginning to pick up as the recession receded.
With a maturation period of five or six years, it has always been difficult
to balance Scotch production with demand. The industry is now exercising
more control than it did a decade ago. Guinness has moth-balled four malt
distilleries this year and production is down to two thirds of capacity.
But the imbalance cannot be corrected quickly. Some suppliers have been able
to buy whisky cheaply on the open market, blend it, bottle it and sell it at
knock-down prices to large retailers.
These tertiary brands, priced as low as Pounds 7.99p a bottle in the UK,
have sold well. They, together with low inflation, have restrained the price
of premium brands - Guinness's price increases this year have averaged 2 per
cent.
The market has polarised. For some consumers value-for-money means buying
the cheapest; for others it means perhaps drinking less, but buying high
quality, premium brands.
'We have not even thought of cutting prices,' Mr Greener said. 'We have a
range of brands that we can position at different price points. To move
existing brands downwards would put us on a slippery slope from which we
would never recover.'
The champagne industry, too, has been beset by the parallel problems of
over-production and economic recession. This year the grand old champagne
houses of Reims and Epernay in eastern France have experienced the toughest
trading conditions in the industry's history.
Earlier this year the difficulties were aggravated by the strength of the
French franc, which had risen by up to 20 per cent against key European
currencies - notably the lire, peseta and sterling.
The strong franc made it more difficult for the champagne houses to maintain
momentum in their export markets. It also raised the risk of 'parallel
imports' being brought into France and Germany from weaker currency
countries.
The total market, which had fallen from a peak of 249m bottles in 1989 to
214m by 1992, was virtually flat in the first half of this year, according
to the Comite Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne. However, this disguises
an increase in sales of low quality petits champagnes, dumped on the market
for as little as FFr35 (Pounds 4) a bottle, squeezing the profitability of
established brands.
Many producers have been forced to cut prices. LVMH, the market leader, this
spring tabled plans for the first ever redundancies in the industry. The
champagne unions won a legal battle to block LVMH's proposed cuts.
Price cuts and the recent fall in the franc's value seem to have some
effect: the CIVC reports that sales of champagne have risen this autumn,
'but only very slightly'.

FT  24 SEP 93 / MGN shares to be sold in offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY stake in Mirror Group Newspapers, the newspaper group once owned
by Mr Robert Maxwell, is to be disposed of by an international offering that
could raise more than Pounds 350m.
Mr John Talbot, the joint administrator of Robert Maxwell Holdings, the
private Maxwell company said yesterday a formal bookbuilding process would
begin on Monday, covering all the 219.7m shares, or 54.8 per cent of the
total.
Virtually all the shares were security for Maxwell loans and are effectively
owned by banks such as National Westminster, Goldman Sachs, Midland and
Lloyds.
Under the bookbuilding operation bidders have a week to submit bids either
at specific prices or at the price which becomes the offer price.
Mr Talbot, who will determine the offer price and the allocations between
individual investors by next Friday, decided an international offering was
the best way to maximise the sum raised.
The Arthur Andersen administrator refused to be drawn yesterday on the price
he hoped to get or whether there was a price below which he would not sell.
The sale could raise Pounds 50m-Pounds 70m for unsecured creditors including
a contribution to the missing millions from Maxwell pension funds.
The way was cleared for the offering by last week's interim results which
showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 69.9m and yesterday's extraordinary general
meeting which approved a settlement between MGN and other Maxwell companies.
NM Rothschild and Cazenove are joint lead managers to the offering; NatWest
Securities, SG Warburg Securities and James Capel are co-lead managers;
Hoare Govett, Nomura International, Paribas Capital Markets and Swiss Bank
are co-managers.
At yesterday's egm, representatives of more than 10,000 pensioners, largely
commercial printing staff, warned they were considering legal action because
they had been excluded from the pension scheme.
Sir Robert Clark, MGN chairman said only those who had actually worked on
the production and distribution of Mirror newspapers could be covered by the
MGN pension scheme.

<TEXT>
SHARES in LVMH, the French luxury goods group, fell by 4.1 per cent
yesterday after a steeper-than-expected fall in first-half profits and a
warning on the full-year result.
The group blamed a further deterioration in the champagne market and a 26
per cent drop in the contribution from Guinness, the UK drinks group in
which it owns a 24 per cent stake, due to sterling's weakness against the
French franc. Page 22

GUINNESS, the UK brewing and spirits group, reported a 9 per cent decline in
first-half profits yesterday, and forecast flat full-year profits and only
modest growth in 1994.
Mr Anthony Greener, chairman and chief executive, said world conditions this
year were 'proving to be less favourable than anticipated. We are still
seeing signs of further deterioration in some major markets.'
He insisted that the group was performing resiliently with key brands
maintaining, or gaining, share in most important regions.
But Guinness shares fell 32p to close at 427p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 320m were at the
lower end of market expectations. The group announced that the full-year
results would be hit by a renewed contribution of Pounds 30m to its pension
fund.
Operating profits fell 7 per cent to Pounds 384m on turnover 13 per cent
ahead at Pounds 1.98bn. Profits from United Distillers, the spirits
division, dipped 8 per cent to Pounds 280m on turnover of Pounds 1.11bn
(Pounds 981m).
Though Scotch whisky volumes rose 2 per cent, sales of deluxe brands were
lower. The change in the sales mix, competitive pricing and increased
marketing costs cut operating margins from 31 to 25 per cent.
Most European markets were depressed. Volume sales were well down in Germany
and Spain, but increased substantially in Greece. In the UK there were signs
of a slowdown in the rate of decline, but prices remained under pressure.
Conditions in Japan and Thailand were difficult. Sales improved in the US,
but volumes declined in Brazil and Mexico.
Brewing contributed Pounds 104m profits, down 4 per cent, on turnover 12 per
cent ahead at Pounds 867m. Cruzcampo, the Spanish operation, contributed
only Pounds 9m compared with Pounds 22m last time.
In Britain, stout volumes were only slightly lower but a continuing decline
in the market, 2 per cent down in the first half, and price competition was
'likely to make profit growth difficult to achieve', Mr Greener said.
He added that there was considerable untapped potential in the Guinness
stout brand - and the group was focusing on expansion in the Caribbean
market with an offer of between Pounds 41m and Pounds 45m for a 51-55 per
cent stake in Desnoes &amp; Geddes, the Jamaican brewer of Red Stripe lager.
Diluted earnings per share were 8 per cent lower at 11.6p. The interim
dividend goes up from 3.35p to 3.62p.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Airbus to lose Dollars 2.5bn orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBUS, the world's second biggest commercial jet aircraft manufacturer,
faces losing Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.62bn) of orders in the wake of the GPA
restructuring proposals yesterday.
GPA has orders for 51 Airbuses which could be cancelled. It singles out the
40 scheduled to be delivered after 1994 and warns that unless cancellation
deadlines are postponed 'it is likely that it would be necessary to cancel
most of the . . . orders'. Those deadlines are the earlier of December 31,
1993 and 30 months before delivery.
Airbus said yesterday it had not discussed this yet with GPA.
The remaining eight could also be cancelled if a charge were paid. GPA said
that the charge could come from 'pre-delivery payments and with no
significant further likely cash outlay'.
Some 45 Airbuses have been delivered so far to GPA. The restructuring
proposals could cut the backlog to a handful.
The aircraft affected are A320 and A321 narrow body jets and A330 widebodied
jets. GPA had already cancelled orders for 30 aircraft. Last December, GPA
was Airbus' biggest customer with 123 aircraft on order.
Airbus still has orders for more than 1,700 aircraft. All four partners in
the Airbus consortium - Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British
Aerospace and Casa of Spain - have had to scale down output to match the
slowdown in expected deliveries of new aircraft.
The consortium's production is now expected to grow from about 150 aircraft
this year to about 170 in 1995, compared with an original target of 225 in
1995.
Boeing comes out of the GPA proposals rather better off. The cancellations
and postponements detailed in the GPA proposals were reached last year.
Boeing had been scheduled to deliver 66 aircraft up to 1997. This has been
reduced to 26 up to 1999.
Cancellation deadlines are being extended for four Boeing 757s. Boeing says
every second order due for delivery in 1997-98 may be postponed for two
years without penalty, and it has given GPA a Dollars 345m financing
facility.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Major rules out Emu in vision of wider EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR today sets out a vision of a wider, free trading European
Community in which power is shifted back to national capitals and monetary
union is put into abeyance.
In an article published in The Economist magazine, the prime minister rules
out a British return to the exchange rate mechanism in the strongest terms
yet, and warns EC member states that the struggle to ratify the Maastricht
treaty has fundamentally changed the EC.
Officials confirmed that the UK government was drawing up plans for a more
flexible alternative to the ERM. The proposal is expected to concentrate on
inflation targets and might be open to countries outside the EC.
Mr Major's comments represent a British attempt to pre-empt further
discussion of economic and monetary union at the special EC summit planned
for next month. His remarks are also intended to reassure Conservative
Euro-sceptics that the government shares their desire to reduce the
influence of the EC over national parliaments.
The prime minister's advisers hope that the tone of the article will help to
marginalise the handful of hard-right backbench MPs who have threatened to
force a divisive leadership election in the autumn.
Officials said Mr Major's main aim was to encourage the summit to
concentrate on achieving a workable Gatt agreement, rather than seeking to
reopen the debate on monetary union.
Mr Major says there can be 'no question of Britain going back into the ERM
in the foreseeable future'. He says 'economic and monetary union is not
realisable in present circumstances, and therefore not relevant to our
economic difficulties'.
He adds: 'I am not prepared to sit down in Brussels in a few weeks' time and
pretend that Humpty Dumpty is whole and well. I care too much about the
European Community to pursue Sellotape policies - patching together the
unmendable - or to play the politics of illusion - pretending it was never
broken.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / IMF study warns of derivatives risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG warning has been issued in an International Monetary Fund study
about risks in the Dollars 8,000bn (Pounds 5,200bn) markets in derivatives
such as futures contracts and currency and interest rate swaps.
It says many transactions are not fully understood by the senior managers of
banks and securities houses.
The IMF study is among the more cautious recent analyses of the Dollars
4,500bn market in over-the-counter derivatives which are designed and sold
by relatively few banks and securities firms with strong capital.
It follows a more sanguine study by the Washington-based Group of 30 large
banks and financial institutions last month, which recommended management
reforms to reduce risks such as default by counterparties, but argued that
the risk of systemic failure was low.
The risks to financial markets posed by derivatives will be one of the chief
topics discussed by bankers at the World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington.
Central bank supervisors are to address the issue at a meeting organised by
the G30 next Monday.
The IMF analysis, in a study of international capital markets, says the
growth in derivatives trading, as companies have sought to hedge the risk of
interest rate and currency movements, could have created unknown risks for
banks.
'Participation in derivatives markets can cause firms to become connected
through complicated transactions in ways that are not easily understood,'
says the study.
Derivatives are financial contracts, the values of which are determined by
the level of an underlying instrument such as exchange rates or currency
values.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Design Council break-up decided by government: 'Business
Links' network to take on consultancy role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Design Council, which provides design advice to British industry and
promotes design education, is to be largely dismantled, the government
announced yesterday.
The council will be reduced to a small advisory body. Many of its functions
will be taken over by the government's planned national network of
integrated service centres for smaller businesses - to be known as Business
Links.
Both the Confederation of British Industry and the Chartered Society of
Designers welcomed the reorganisation but there was strong criticism of the
move from some business leaders.
The Design Council, which receives a Pounds 7.5m annual government grant,
employs more than 200 staff. By the end of next year, when the
reorganisation is likely to be complete, it could have fewer than 50 and a
grant of under Pounds 3m.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade and industry minister, told the council that more
had to be done 'to move design as a subject into the mainstream'. The
government had decided that a 'major redirection and refocusing of the
council's work' was called for.
The council has been criticised in recent years for becoming too preoccupied
with engineering aspects of design and not concerned enough with public
campaigning and aspects of industrial design such as styling.
Mr Bill Moggridge, co-founder of Ideo, a leading international design
consultancy, said the council had played a 'tremendously powerful part' in
British design, but had not had 'a very evident role' in recent years.
Sir William Barlow, former chairman of BICC, the cables and construction
group, who is president of the Royal Academy of Engineering and a former
Design Council chairman, said he had not seen details of the reorganisation
but 'it would be very disappointing if they were doing away with it. It
would be throwing away a national asset'.
Mr John Sacks, chairman of the Office Furniture and Filing Manufacturers'
Association, said the move was a 'very considerable disappointment'. The
council had helped in 'bringing together different influences that affect
our industry'.
The planned national network of about 200 'one-stop shops' for small and
medium-sized businesses will take over design advice and consultancy. The
business-led Training and Enterprise Councils are co-ordinating the setting
up of the centres.

A STRONG WARNING has been issued in an International Monetary Fund study
about risks in the Dollars 8,000bn (Pounds 5,195bn) markets in derivatives
such as futures contracts and currency and interest rate swaps.
It says many transactions are not fully understood by the senior managers of
banks and securities houses.
The IMF study is among the more cautious recent analyses of the Dollars
4,500bn market in over-the-counter derivatives which are designed and sold
by relatively few banks and securities firms with strong capital.
It follows a more sanguine study by the Washington-based Group of 30 large

reforms to reduce risks such as default by counterparties, but argued that
the risk of systemic failure was low.
The risks to financial markets posed by derivatives will be one of the chief
topics discussed by bankers at the World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington.
Central bank supervisors are to address the issue at a meeting organised by
the G30 next Monday.
The IMF analysis in a study of international capital markets emphasises
concerns that the growth in derivatives trading, as companies have sought to
hedge the risk of interest rate and currency movements, could have created
unknown risks for banks.
'Participation in derivatives markets can cause firms to become connected
through complicated transactions in ways that are not easily understood,'
says the study. This makes it 'extremely difficult' to assess the risk of
default.
Derivatives are financial contracts the values of which are determined by
the level of an underlying instrument such as exchange rates or currency
values. They allow companies to hedge risks, for example by swapping a
variable rate obligation for a fixed rate one.
The study says that it is 'not entirely reassuring' that banks have escaped
problems until now. Similar rapid growth of a single activity by banks in
the past has been accompanied by 'both a weakening of internal controls and
an under-assessment of credit risk'. The credit risk taken by banks in their
derivatives exposures is equivalent to the cost of replacing a contract if
the counterparty defaults. This is a fraction of the contract's notional
value.

FT  24 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The run up in Mirror Group's shares over the past year is good news for the
administrators, but raises the question of how much value is left for those
who are lining up for the book-building exercise. There will be no dividend
until 1994, and even then any payout is likely to be modest. At the same
time, the current share price of 178p offers buyers only a small discount to
the market's rating. Given the risks, a lower rating may be required to
shift such a large stake.
Most worrying is the thought that the genial bonhomie of the chancellor
masks a preparedness to slap VAT on newspapers. He has, after all, taken on
lobbies such as doctors, teachers and the police in the past. That would
give another twist to the screw currently being applied by News
International's cover price cut. So far, the Mirror's circulation has not
been damaged, though given its heavy dependence on circulation revenue it
can neither afford to match the effort nor allow a long term gap to open.
Perhaps potential investors should ponder the fact that no buyer has been
prepared to pay for control of this singular media product at anything like
the current share price.

FT  24 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Wm Morrison
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chill winds from the north blew through the food retailing sector yesterday
and knocked another 5 per cent from Tesco and Sainsbury's share prices.
William Morrison's interim figures showed just how pressure on margins is
increasing with turnover up by almost 20 per cent and profits up by barely
5. Equally alarming was the company's acknowledgement that consumers are
trading down, and that Morrison will respond with lower margins. The message
for those superstore operators who have paid up to twice what Morrison has
forked out on a typical site is clear. Returns on capital employed - which
the grocers have long argued are not excessive - seem about to turn
distinctly sour. Aggressive pricing of branded products may also intensify
as manufacturers respond to weak sales with price cuts, exacerbating the
deflation of superstores' turnover and profits.
As share prices fall, however, the search for value starts. Morrison is
particularly badly placed since its miserly 1 per cent yield offers little
defence. Even with most of the profits retained in the business, there will
be a cash outflow over the next year to pay for the 'unabated' store opening
programme and new distribution facilities. On that basis, Tesco's 20 per
cent yield premium to the market ought to offer some comfort. Yet its higher
cost base and the suspicion that the fall in gross margins has only just
begun will weight heavy. Even mighty Sainsbury's sub-market yield looks
under threat. Sainsbury has always looked immune to the sector's troubles.
But until yesterday, that was true of Morrison, too.

The muted response of the stock market to President Clinton's healthcare
proposals reflects the absence of either hard detail or nasty shocks. Drug
companies should gain volume sales as the healthcare net is widened. The
trade-off is lower prices as the discounts demanded by the government's
Medicare programme for the elderly increase, and power concentrates in the
hands of big private sector buyers. The overall impact is likely to be
negative, but investors were anticipating as much. The extent of the damage
will not be clear until the process of political horse-trading has come to
an end.
True, drugs companies have escaped direct price controls. But prices paid by
big buyers of healthcare are already falling as market forces take hold. By
proposing to extend the role of such buying groups, President Clinton is
simply accelerating the trend. Capping the rate of growth in health
insurance premiums may anyway have much the same effect as direct controls,
since insurers will have more of an incentive to restrict the cost of
claims. Making all employers bear at least 80 per cent of healthcare costs
will equally increase the number of parties with an interest in keeping
drugs prices down.
The range of responses by drugs companies to such change, in the US and
elsewhere, suggests a degree of confusion. Glaxo believes that innovative
research and good marketing will suffice. Wellcome is developing its
position in over-the-counter medicines, while others are moving into
low-cost generic drugs. Merck's acquisition of Medco, the postal drugs
distributor, is a bold attempt at vertical integration. Not all the options
will turn out to be correct.

FT  24 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: No cheer at Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since whisky drinkers tend to be older people, it starts to look as though
they will all be dead before they get round to trading up again. Yesterday's
interim figures from Guinness were another case of hope deferred, this time
till 1995. First half spirits profits fell 10 per cent at constant exchange
rates, and, while whisky sales rose 2 per cent by volume, luxury brands
showed a fall of 5 per cent. The longer Guinness continues to produce such
disappointing results, the more insistent is the question of whether a
strategy based on pushing customers towards ever more expensive brands is
fundamentally flawed. It is not much consolation that all the volume fall in
luxury brands was due to specific problems in Thailand, Mexico and Brazil.
These are just the sort of emerging markets tailor-made for trading up.
Having set so much store by brand enhancement, though, Guinness cannot
afford to admit to doubt. It may be right that economic recovery will
eventually revive demand for high-priced spirits, but the faint flicker of a
revival in the US is hardly yet conclusive evidence. One problem is that
high stocks will keep the base price for standard whiskies depressed. That
will limit Guinness' ability to raise prices on its premium products.
At best, it will be years before the Guinness promise feeds through to
profits growth. At worst, the company faces the tricky task of shifting from
high margin exclusive brands to a more volume-driven approach. Guinness
already seems to be hedging its bets by stepping up its marketing effort on
neglected cheaper brands. Its strong cash flow and dividend cover provide
some reassurance, but, even at last night's close of 427p, a yield of 3.5
per cent is hardly attractive.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While Bank of England governor Eddie George has international director
Andrew Crockett to thank for much of the substance of his thoughtful speech
earlier this week on how Europe should face up to the post-ERM age, Crockett
himself may well already be looking forward to a much larger stage from
which to air his own views on world economic affairs.
For Alexandre Lamfalussy, the sensible but somewhat crusty general manager
of the secretive Bank for International Settlements, steps down next summer
and Crockett has emerged as the front runner to replace him at the
Basle-based central bankers' bank.
His appointment would be cheering news for Britain, which in the BIS's
63-year history has never managed to secure a UK national at the top of the
organisation. It would also dovetail neatly with UK aspirations to muscle
into the mainstream of European economic thinking now that the continent is
staring a broken exchange rate mechanism in the face.
An outgoing 50-year-old, who has been marked down for higher things ever
since he took over his Threadneedle Street job in 1989 after a 17-year stint
at the International Monetary Fund, Crockett is one of the more talkative
and free-thinking among UK economic policy-makers. So he would be expected
to inject a new sense of drive; the BIS certainly could do with speaking up
rather more than in the past when it comes to big discussions on whither the
world economy.

</HEADLINE>

Now that Wendy Pritchard is working roughly one day a month to develop the
Treasury's fusty management habits, expect a rash of orders from nervous
mandarins for her book, Changing the Essence.
Written last year with long-time collaborator Richard Beckhard, the volume
is brimming with tips to big organisations on how to change their cultures,
garnered from her experience advising the likes of Shell and Lloyds Bank. If
the Treasury takes this advice, it can look forward to turning itself into a
'learning organisation, with policies and practices that support this
stance'.
Meanwhile, permanent and deputy secretaries have the prospect of becoming
'deeply committed to personal leadership of change programs consciously
designed to create the organisation's best future'.
The advice to create 'a superior ability to sense signals in the
environment' presumably betrays a deep understanding of the importance of
improving the Treasury's forecasting record.

Tuesday's announcement that Sir John Banham will become chairman of Tarmac
early in the new year has set tongues wagging in the local government world.
Banham is chairman of the Local Government Commission which is busy
reorganising English local authorities. It is unlikely to have completed its
task much before the end of next year.
Although Banham has told the commission that he plans to see the review
through to the end, this looks like an excellent early exit route for him.
He hinted in the summer that he would resign if the government rejected the
commission's recommendations and ministers are promising to do just that if,
as expected, the commission decides to leave some counties unchanged.

Under-capitalised small businessmen would doubtless have little sympathy
with the plight of 26-year-old Richard Li, who cannot quite decide how best
to deploy the tidy Dollars 400m that has just landed in his bank account.
Half the cash has come his way following the sale of a stake in Hong
Kong-based satellite broadcaster Star TV to Rupert Murdoch, while his
father, Li Ka-shing, one of the colony's leading businessmen, was so proud
of his offspring's handling of the deal that he made it up to a round
Dollars 400m from the family coffers.
But Li is engagingly vague as to how he intends to spend his largesse. 'I'm
in the position of having a completely blank sheet of paper,' he confesses,
adding that he rather fancies bringing 'existing state-of-the-art technology
to virgin markets in Asia.' Not that that rules out investment in
'conservative businesses' such as property and infrastructure, he goes on.
But how about his recent elevation to the position of deputy chairman of
Hutchison Whampoa, the colony's oldest company? Might there not be, even in
broad-minded Hong Kong, well, a slight conflict of interest?
Describing the Hutchison job as a 'family obligation', which at this stage
does not absorb all his energies, he insists that, should any minority
shareholder express such concerns, he would naturally consider stepping
aside.
Li reckons his new venture will take six to eight months to establish and he
even fights shy of divulging a name. But at least there are no immediate
staffing problems; 70 of his former Star colleagues are apparently poised to
follow the pied piper.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Harsh medicine's tastegood factor: The Clintons' healthcare
reform plan is controversial but crafted to have a broad appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has crossed the Rubicon on healthcare. After his
impassioned speech to Congress on Wednesday night, it is hard to doubt that
the US will enact a comprehensive reform within the next year. Many of the
details of Mr Clinton's plan will be changed in what is likely to be the
most heavily lobbied legislation in US history. But America is now firmly on
the path to fundamental reform.
This is no small achievement. Since the early 1970s, when Richard Nixon
unveiled abortive reform proposals, successive presidents have shied away
from this most intractable of American social problems. Unlike his
predecessors, Mr Clinton has always wanted to embrace the complexities of
healthcare reform. He had to go through the grind of a deficit-cutting
budget earlier this year. But healthcare is what he really cares about: it
is the heart and soul of his presidency and he will be judged by the
perceived success of his reforms.
When Mr Clinton waved a credit-card sized prototype Health Security Card in
front of Congress and pledged to provide care for all Americans 'that can
never be taken away', it was clear that he regarded himself as the heir of a
long tradition of Democratic social reformers. He referred obliquely to
Franklin Roosevelt, who laid the foundations for the US welfare state in the
1930s with the introduction of social security (old age pensions) and
unemployment benefits.
Today, said Mr Clinton Americans could not conceive of a world without
public-sector pensions; in 50 years (thanks to his reforms) they would be
unable to imagine lacking access to healthcare.
He stuck to six broad principles. Reform, he said, should offer 'security,
simplicity, savings, choice, quality and responsibility'. The political
advantage of not getting bogged down in complexities is that, even if
congressional committees greatly alter the details of his plan, Mr Clinton
can still claim credit for the final reform - or at least share it with his
wife Hillary, who led the healthcare task force. Conscious that fundamental
change cannot be wrought without Republican support, Mr Clinton also made a
strong appeal for bipartisan backing.
The plan is crafted to appeal to different constituencies. Mr Clinton wants
to introduce a form of 'managed competition' - a concept invented by
conservative-leaning economists such as Mr Alain Enthoven of Stanford
University. The basic idea is that most people would be enrolled in large,
regional purchasing co-operatives known as 'health alliances'. The theory is
that alliances would use their market clout to obtain high-quality care at
the lowest possible prices from competing groups of doctors and hospitals in
the private sector. Companies with more than 5,000 employees would be able
to set up their own 'corporate alliances'.
Alliances would publish information about the price and range of benefits
offered by the competing health plans in their areas, each of which would
have to offer a federally certified package of standard benefits.
Individuals would choose from among the plans. Employers would have to pay
at least 80 per cent of the cost of the average premium of locally available
plans. Government subsidies would ensure that health costs would not absorb
more than 8 per cent of total payroll spending; for small companies with
low-paid employees, the cap would be set at 3.5 per cent of payroll. The
unemployed, the self-employed and other people on low incomes would receive
direct subsidies to enable them to purchase care via an alliance.
Since the employer contribution and/or the government subsidy would be based
on the average cost of insurance premiums, individuals would have an
incentive to select the cheaper plans. This tendency would be strongly
reinforced by proposed rules on direct patient contributions. Individuals
who enter pre-paid Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs), which deploy
'gate- keepers' akin to British GPs and allow patients to consult only a
limited number of specialists under contract with the plan, would pay a flat
Dollars 10 a visit. But those who select unrestricted 'fee-for-service'
plans, under which physicians charge separately for each item of service,
would have to pay 20 per cent of each bill - in addition to their 20 per
cent share of the insurance premium itself. The likely result would be to
push all but the affluent into HMOs.
This version of managed competition, however, is to be buttressed by a
series of reforms calculated to appeal to left-leaning Democrats. The
Clinton administration would set up a seven-member National Health Board
with general powers to regulate the entire healthcare industry - one-seventh
of the economy. It would oversee the creation and operation of the health
alliances, which would be quasi-public bodies. It would have powers not only
to limit spending on public schemes, such as Medicare (for the elderly), but
also to limit the rate of growth of the premiums charged by private-sector
health plans. Although the White House has rejected direct controls on the
prices of drugs and other forms of healthcare, by setting caps on premiums
it would thus impose budgetary controls on the private sector for the first
time.
Mr Clinton would also strive to improve the fairness of the healthcare
system and redirect spending from high-tech medicine to primary and
preventive care. Financial incentives, for example, would encourage medical
students to become general practitioners, a comparative rarity in the US,
and to practise in under-served inner cities and poor rural areas. Planned
new benefits would include long-term domiciliary care for the elderly and
chronically ill and an increased range of services for the mentally ill - a
group dis-criminated against in the present system.
Mr Clinton is wooing support from the nation's governors by offering
individual states considerable flexibility. States that dislike the concept
of managed competition can opt for a Canadian-style 'single payer' system
under which the state government would purchase all care for citizens from
competing groups of private-sector providers. He will also let states
introduce the reforms as and when they are ready with a final deadline for
creating alliances of January 1997.
The president presented his plan as an evolutionary advance from the present
system. In many ways this is an understatement: it involves big and
controversial changes. Much attention is being focused on the fairness or
otherwise of imposing a legal requirement on employers to pay at least 80
per cent of the average cost of health premiums. To the objection that this
is unjustified coercion, Mr Clinton's reply is that many companies will be
better off: under the present voluntary system, large companies often pay
100 per cent of health costs. Small businesses that already provide
insurance will gain the most, because their costs will be capped well below
current rates. It is only 'free riders' that will face a financial penalty.
What the debate about the 'employer mandate' tends to mask is that the
planned creation of huge regional purchasing co-operatives involves a much
reduced role for employers. Under the present rules, they pay for employees'
insurance but they also make the important decisions - for example, whether
to put employees into an HMO. Under the Clintons' scheme, individual
employees will choose from among the competing plans offered by the local
health alliance. Employers enter the picture only as providers of resources:
their 80 per cent contribution is effectively a payroll tax.
Mr Clinton's decision to put individuals at the heart of his system should
please conservatives. But if employers are to be used only as a source of
revenue, the question arises: why pick on them? Payroll taxes are already
high and the system of subsidies proposed for small business looks complex.
In economic terms it would make more sense to finance healthcare through a
consumption tax, for example a national value-added tax, which would not
tend to reduce demand for labour. Mr Clinton's reply would be that such an
upheaval is not politically feasible; he has to build on present
arrangements which happen to put most of the financing burden on employers.
In the longer run, however, finance could be sought from other sources.
The proposed new limits on the permitted rate of growth of premiums for
private health plans also represent a radical departure. It is one thing to
put curbs on the permitted growth of tax-financed healthcare - every country
does this. But Mr Clinton is trying to place controls on private-sector
spending. Many conservatives will argue that this is wholly unacceptable:
even Britain, with a nationalised health system, does not try to limit the
growth of private-sector health premiums.
The most damaging critique of the White House plan is perhaps that the
numbers do not add up. Mr Clinton is proposing to extend insurance cover to
37m people (15 per cent of the population) and offer all families benefits
as good as if not better than those provided by Fortune 500 companies. He is
also proposing extensive subsidies for small business and low-income
families. Yet he claims this can be financed without a substantial increase
in income or consumption taxes (the only new levies planned are minor 'sin
taxes' on cigarettes). Additional spending of Dollars 350bn (Pounds 230bn)
between 1994 and 2000 is to be financed by halving the planned growth of
existing federal schemes such as Medicare and Medicaid (the scheme for the
poor). Indeed, the White House claims the scheme will actually produce net
savings of Dollars 91bn which could be used to reduce the budget deficit.
Scepticism is understandable: the costs of most previous social reforms has
been grossly underestimated. Yet it is important to be clear about what Mr
Clinton is actually proposing. On his own numbers he is planning to increase
healthcare spending from 14 per cent of GDP today to nearly 17.5 per cent by
end of the century. That ought to provide sufficient room to expand
insurance coverage and improve benefits: the US would be spending roughly
three times as much of GDP on healthcare as Britain. The talk of 'savings'
is illusory (as usual) because they are measured relative to baseline
projections that, on unchanged policies, show healthcare absorbing an
exorbitant 19 per cent of GDP by the end of the century, rather than
levelling off at 17.5 per cent.
The big question is how much of the plan Mr Clinton can get through
Congress. The omens are encouraging. The healthcare cost explosion has been
accompanied by growing public anxiety about access to care. Those affected
include not only the uninsured but millions of middle-income families who
fear loss of insurance cover should a breadwinner lose a job or contract a
serious illness. Many families have also been adversely affected by
employers' decisions either to wind up company schemes or sharply cut
benefits.
The upshot is that opinion polls indicate a surprising degree of public
support for radical reform. According to a New York Times/CBS poll, 90 per
cent of the population (including 85 per cent of Republicans) say the
healthcare system needs either complete rebuilding or fundamental change -
though 70 per cent were happy with their own care. More than 50 per cent
appear willing to accept reforms that would limit their access to doctors, a
proposal once regarded as political suicide. This may reflect the revolution
already under way in the private sector: as companies have sought to contain
runaway costs, the proportion of people enrolled in HMOs and other forms of
'managed care' has already risen from 9m in 1980 to 41m today.
As was evident on Wednesday night, the attitude toward reform on Capitol
Hill is positive. After the frustrations of the Reagan/Bush years, when
rivalry between a Republican White House and Democratic Congress caused
legislative 'gridlock', senior politicians in both parties are keen to make
progress. The risk, however, is that, as lobbyists step up their pressure on
Congress, controversial elements of the Clinton plan - such as mandates on
employers - will be dropped or watered down. There is little doubt that the
US will enact the appealing elements of the plan, such as guaranteed health
cover for all; the difficulty will be ensuring that the unpleasant medicine
is also swallowed.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Next steps for Mr Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BORIS YELTSIN seems to be winning his gamble. By cutting the constitutional
knot ravelling Russia, he has given himself room for manoeuvre. But to
succeed, he must now exploit it.
When a country's constitution prevents it from being governed,
extra-constitutional action is inescapable. In such situations, power
resides with those who command the loyalty of the apparatus of coercion.
President Yeltsin has this far proved to be that person. So long as his
opponents remain ineffective, even ridiculous, Mr Yeltsin should
scrupulously avoid doing anything to turn them into martyrs. But if they
were to appear capable of thwarting the elections he proposes, let alone of
starting an armed insurrection, he would have to prevent them. Even the
possibility of such action would make many in the west uncomfortable. But
the west's interests are inescapably aligned with those of Mr Yeltsin on the
need for civil order and reform.
If this sombre possibility is to be avoided, the Russian president must make
his authority unquestionable. Often the appearance of authority creates the
reality. Mr Yeltsin must use his present advantage, therefore, if he is to
retain it.
The first requirement is implementation of the elections for the new lower
house both expeditiously and efficiently. According to Mr Vladimir Shumeiko,
brought back into his former position as first deputy prime minister, the
new lower house - to be known as the State Duma - will have 270 of its 400
deputies elected from single member constituencies and a further 130 elected
by party lists. This last measure will give fledgling parties a role, and
offer then a lever for exerting party discipline. Meanwhile, the upper
house, or Council of the Federation, will not initially be elected. It is
currently composed of the leaders of the regional and republican
administrations and soviets, and will be transformed into the senior
legislative chamber. In current Russian circumstances, these proposals seem
rather sensible.
The second requirement is early promulgation of a new constitution. At the
moment there are two versions on offer, the parliament's, which
unsurprisingly gives power to parliament, and the president's, which gives
power to the president. The latter is at present the only basis for stable
democratic rule in Russia. In the absence of parties or even a broad
umbrella reform movement, a parliamentary system cannot produce stable,
responsible government. Moreover, those who stand for the power of
parliament are hostile to democracy, while the president's party contains
most of those who believe in it. But a presidential constitution would need
checks and balances, including a clear division of powers, entrenched
individual rights and a new supreme court.
The third requirement is rapid implementation of economic stabilisation and
reform. The chief justification for Mr Yeltsin's action is that parliament
was destroying all hope of rescuing the Russian economy. If the government
fails to act decisively now, it will destroy the case for the president's
actions. Mr Yeltsin must support Mr Yegor Gaidar, back as first deputy prime
minister, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, in their attempts to
control the budget deficit, restructure prices, reform trade and liberalise
the economy. As and when such action is forthcoming, the west must promptly
put its long promised financial support in place.
Russia's long-awaited economic and political reform must start right now.
The next year could then see election of parliament and president,
introduction of a workable constitution and a start on economic
reconstruction. This is the task Mr Yeltsin has set himself. For the sake
both of his country and the world, he must succeed. The west, for its part,
must do what it can to help.

<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN is right to ignore those who would have him declare that
the Liberal Democrats will support a future Labour government but not a
Conservative one. The role of his party is still what that of British centre
parties has been for most of the century: to prevent the parties of the left
and the right from moving towards the extreme. To do that it is necessary to
keep them guessing, at least between elections.
There would also be no political advantage in promising a post-election pact
with Labour now. The effect might be to deprive the Lib Dems of their most
precious current asset, the anti-Conservative protest vote. It would anyway
reduce Mr Ashdown's party to that of an appendage.
That said, the Liberal Democrats profess views that are virtually
indistinguishable from those of the 'modernisers' in the Labour party. At
the Lib Dem conference in Torquay this week nothing was proposed by anybody,
including Mr Ashdown himself, that Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, could
easily quarrel with. The Liberal Democrats stressed individualism, within a
community framework, overseen by an active government; at its conference
next week Labour is expected to favour an active government, community
values, and room for individual expression.
Mr Ashdown's party favours a Scottish assembly, regional parliaments, reform
of the House of Lords and proportional representation; Mr Smith's a
referendum on the latter and a version of all of the other proposed
constitutional changes. Both parties are pro-European, Mr Ashdown's the more
strongly of the two, but in the Liberal Democrats' case there has been some
retreat, as in their leader's speech yesterday, from the notion that
Brussels knows best. The two opposition parties would both propound full
employment and greater government expenditure, Labour while limiting tax
increases, the Liberal Democrats while attempting to explain them.
More to the point the growth in support for Mr Ashdown's party is largely
explicable by the unpopularity of the government. The Lib Dems have
established a base as the principal challenger to the Conservatives in the
west of England; they are no such threat to Labour in the north. This is in
line with the historic experience of the Liberals since 1945: when the
Conservatives are in power but out of favour, the non-socialist alternative
party does well.
At this stage there is little point in picking holes in this or that Liberal
Democrat policy document. They are far from power, and their best chance
might be, willy-nilly, to vote with a Labour government, assuming one is
elected. It may be, however, that the present increase in support for the
Lib Dems is no mere blip - that, as Mr Ashdown intimated yesterday, further
hard work by the party will bring further advances in public support.
This is possible, but it is not entirely for Mr Ashdown to determine. If
Labour is seen at its conference next week to be on the way to true
modernisation, it may begin to attract voters in natural Liberal Democratic
territory. If not, the reverse could be the case. Again, if the
Conservatives trip themselves up for another year or more, Mr Ashdown will
reap a rich harvest; if the Tories recover their sense of purpose, they may
begin to recover their electorate.
It is the fate of British centre parties thus to be at the mercy of Labour
and the Conservatives. Much was said in Torquay about the feel of things
being different this time. Mr Ashdown has projected himself as an
anti-politician, a British Ross Perot. It has taken him, and his party, a
long way. He is more popular than either Mr Smith or the prime minister. He
can do little other than carry on as an independent force, waiting to see
what turns up.

BRITISH time is out of joint with the rest of Europe. That the UK spends
most of the year lagging an hour behind the rest of Europe is an unnecessary
disruption to the life of British business and commerce. That summer-time
ends a month later in Britain than on the continent, where the clocks fall
back this weekend, only adds to the confusion.
It's time for a change, as Mr Michael Howard has acknowledged. The home
secretary wants Britain to move to what his ministry calls 'single double
summer-time', code for continental European time. Winter-time would then
arrive one hour ahead of Greenwich mean time, and summer-time two hours
ahead.
Conservative defenders of GMT are up in arms. But it is northern Scots who
deserve sympathy. Daylight in the Scottish isles would then arrive well
after nine o'clock in winter, although their short evenings would be longer.
Euro-sceptics are likely to cause more serious problems for the government.
It will rely on evidence that lighter evenings mean fewer traffic accidents.
But subsidiarity allows governments to choose common European standards if
they wish. A pan-European time-zone is in Britain's interests. Mr Howard
should say so.

You have to shake your head to believe it. It is less than a year and a half
since the last general election and some of us are already in a fuss about
the next one. Technically speaking - and the Grim Reaper permitting - the
government elected in April 1992 can sit there until 1997. Even if it
follows recent precedent, it need not face the electorate before October
1996. That is three years away. Meanwhile there should be nothing to get
excited about. The principal parties are currently led by two grey Johns and
a puffed-up Paddy. Political discourse ought to be at a low ebb for, say, at
least another 24 months.
That it is not is partly the fault of our national appetite for the
savouring of politicians' discomfiture. The British seem to take a
particular, and perverse, pleasure in watching holders of high office
self-destruct, even to the extent of helping the destruction along a little.
Now the hunt is on for a new victim. The pack that brought down Mr David
Mellor and Mr Norman Lamont, to name but two, is baring its teeth at the
prime minister.
After a blooding, the urge to kill is hard to repress. I have to confess
that I rode out with the Lamont hunt once or thrice and found the experience
exhilarating. The public seems to enjoy the sport as much as the mounted
participants. This is one reason, although not the only one, why the
Conservative conference in Blackpool the week after next will be about a
single subject: can Mr John Major survive?
Patience. Before that we will know the answer to the other great
single-question conference of the season. When Labour meets in Brighton this
weekend, the matter that will dominate the proceedings will be whether Mr
John Smith wins a procedural vote next Wednesday morning. If he fails, local
trade unions will continue to exert undue influence over the choice of
candidates for parliamentary elections, at least until the issue is
obliterated by Labour's national executive committee. The message would be
that Mr Smith's leadership of the Labour party has been undermined by
powerful trade union leaders. From that it is but a short step to 'can John
Smith survive?' If he prevails, the selection of Labour candidates will be
determined by a vote of registered members of the party. 'Smith', the
headlines will inform us, 'triumphs'.
That is the main plot-line. There is likely to be little else to grab the
nation's attention in next week's instalment of Britain's soap-opera
politics. Yet this ungripping yarn has already determined the shape of the
conference. In preparing for it Mr Smith's managers have been faced with an
awkward choice. If the candidacy vote had been scheduled for Monday, as was
originally the case, rules and precedent would have prevented Mr Smith from
speaking before the event. It is alleged that the vote is on a knife-edge,
that it could go either way. If he lost on Monday, 'Smith humiliated' would
have been the message for the rest of the week.
The vote therefore moves to Wednesday morning. This gives the Labour leader
his chance to make his big speech on Tuesday. In it he will devote all his
Scottish moral passion to an onslaught on the Conservatives. Much good may
it do him. He will also seek, without necessarily saying so, to cast himself
as a moderniser when it comes to constitutional reform and a Labour radical
on the economy. Echoing his speech to the Trades Union Congress a few weeks
ago, he will argue for full employment (at least if part-time work is
included), the minimum wage, and trade union recognition.
His hope will be that some of his phrases get through, or at least enough of
them to give the impression that his factionalised parliamentary party is
united and that he is a leader with a sense of direction. We can be sure
that it will be a stout effort. Mr Smith can then return to the platform on
Wednesday morning to state the case for one-member-one-vote in candidacy
elections. With luck, and last-minute scurries, he may even win.
This plot-line has a fatal flaw. It lacks real drama. There is no
possibility of blood on the carpet. There has been some debate among the
Labour leader's advisers over whether he should say - on Tuesday or
Wednesday, it makes no difference - something like 'I could not remain as
leader of the party if candidate selection is not democratised' or, in
headline form, 'back me or sack me, says Smith'. The argument against such a
grandstand play, an argument that as I write still prevails, is that it
would echo Mr Major's similar intimations over the Maastricht vote, and thus
reveal Mr Smith to be as weak as some perceive the prime minister to be.
It is a poor argument. What Labour needs is something that will blast away
the image, held in southern voters' minds, of a collectivist party that
represses individual aspirations, the representative of life in the co-op
and on the council estate.
As Mr Tony Blair says in the latest Fabian Review, the need is to stamp
Labour as the party of 'new economic opportunity, not engaged in a battle
for territory between private and public sector; as helping people out of
welfare, not keeping them on it; of high-quality public services, not the
defence of vested interests; of ensuring social action assists individual
responsibility and is not substituted for it in areas like crime . . .'
The way to get all that across (and there is more on Mr Blair's agenda) is
to offer up Mr Smith as a potential sacrifice. We all know the danger of
threatening to resign. You may have to. This would be sad for Mr Smith, but
Labour without reform of its internal constitution is hardly worth leading.
Mr Blair reminds us that the party faces the same task as left parties
every-where, which is to adjust to a changing society, 'a question of
dealing not simply with the flotsam and jetsam of individual policies or
per-sonalities but with a tide of ideas'.
Yes and no. When you face a TV-addicted electorate, personal melodrama is
likely to be the most effective means of communicating a change in the tide
of ideas. 'Smith lays his job on the line' followed by 'triumphs' would not
in itself suffice, but it would start to shake voters' perceptions of the
party. As Mr Blair says, looking two or three years ahead, Labour 'must fear
nothing, except losing again'.

<TEXT>
Sir, Before we get too carried away by reports about the governor of the
Bank of England's discussions with the high-street banks over their lending
policies towards the smaller business, we should remember the dangers of
over-expansion as we come out of recession ('Bank governor calls in
clearers', September 21).
Of course we should encourage industry to grow and invest, but having
survived the recession the companies that have learnt to play defensively
must not go down because they are now encouraged to over-trade. The
disciplines that the banks' lending policies impose should protect many
survivors from this danger.
Receivers are often accused of being the undertakers to British industry,
yet a large proportion of our work is in helping industry and lenders
redirect businesses that might have failed to survive.
Experience has taught us that more companies fail coming out of a recession
than during one. If we are to learn from the mistakes of the past,
industry/lenders/advisers have all got to work together to make certain that
the light at the end of the tunnel is not the proverbial train.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK GERARD NICHOLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As an American expatriate living in Paris, I am often asked: 'Are the
United States as dangerous as they seem?' Unfortunately there is no denying
the statistics. The recent attention given by the media to violent crime
against tourists ('Florida struggles to limit damage to tourist industry',
September 16) only highlights events that have been dramatically increasing
for years.
The measures being implemented by the state of Florida will only temporarily
stem the flow; it must be realised that until we elect an administration
willing to confront the powers of the National Rifle Association and
restrict the rise of handguns, nothing will change in the short term.
Loss estimates for Florida's tourist industry are running close to Dollars
1bn. Perhaps this will hit the legislators most effectively - in their
pockets.

FT  24 SEP 93 / A rapid loss of height: Asian airlines face growing pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seemed an unbeatable combination. For more than a decade, south-east
Asia's airlines developed a worldwide image of exotic service to exotic
locations, while simultaneously profiting from lucrative but restricted
routes in their own region's high-growth economies.
But they are suffering the consequences of their push into other aviation
markets. They are having to confront more aggressive competition, and a
realisation that it may take more than advertisements showing smiling
Singapore hostesses to bring in the passengers.
Cathay Pacific, of Hong Kong, recently announced a 46 per cent drop in
profits for the first half of 1993. Singapore Airlines (SIA) saw profits
fall 8.4 per cent in the year to March, and Thai Airlines announced earnings
of 594m baht for the nine months to June - 67 per cent lower than the
previous year.
A primary cause of the fall in earnings has been the success of Asia's
aviation market: recession-hit western airlines have transferred aircraft to
routes into the region to curb losses in their home territories. South-east
Asian airlines have also been the victim of the success of their domestic
economies, where rising labour and land prices have increased operating
costs.
Mr Rod Eddington, Cathay Pacific's managing director, says: 'Asian airlines
will never be able to rely on the combination of circumstances which they
have had in the past, to guarantee them high profitability. They had low
labour costs, rapidly growing markets and a substantial degree of lack of
interest from North American and other airlines.'
According to the International Air Transport Association, the Asia-Pacific
region - which stretches from the Indian subcontinent to Australasia -
accounted for 25 per cent of the world's passenger traffic in 1985. By 2000,
it is projected to represent close to 40 per cent, in an area where average
fares are higher per kilometre than in either Europe or North America.
The market's fast growth means that, despite the recent downturn, south-east
Asia's airlines remain more profitable than their main competitors, many of
which are making losses. SIA and Cathay are likely to be the first and third
most profitable airlines in the world this year - even though a cabin crew
strike in January is estimated to have cost Cathay HKDollars 240m (Pounds
20.2m).
But a combination of factors is clouding the sky ahead. The most pressing
has been Japan's shift towards recession. Japanese travellers represent the
largest single market for most of Asia's airlines.
Figures from the Japan Travel Bureau, the tourism office, are expected to
show a slight fall in the total number of Japanese overseas travellers
during July and August 1993 - the first drop in six years - while Japanese
travellers to Asian destinations are expected to fall by 10 per cent over
the same period.
The impact has already been felt: Cathay's passenger yields (a measure of
revenue per passenger kilometre) fell by 6.1 per cent in the first half of
1993, while SIA's yields fell 6.7 per cent during 1992.
When Japan's economic cycle swings upwards, airline earnings across Asia
would be expected to follow, since the aviation industry is sensitive to
consumer spending patterns. But each south-east Asian airline faces further
individual problems:
Cathay's profits are being squeezed by Hong Kong's annual inflation rate of
9 per cent. Its efforts to curb costs led to the 15-day cabin crew strike.
The profits of Malaysian Airline System (MAS) have suffered from
misjudgments made in the late 1980s. Over-optimistic estimates of demand
growth have left it with too many new aircraft. At the same time, the
Malaysian government has fixed prices on domestic routes, which MAS is
obliged to operate, at below cost.
SIA is exposed more than other south-east Asian airlines to the recession
affecting European and North American routes, where it has expanded rapidly
over the past decade.
Thai Air has a record of poor management. Past inefficiencies in placing
orders for aircraft, for instance, have left the airline with a fleet
comprising nine aircraft types, made by five aircraft manufacturers, with
three makes of engine. The company plans to simplify its fleet.
Two common challenges face south-east Asia's airlines. The first is the
downward pressure on prices caused by competition. The Asian fleet grew
rapidly during the 1980s, but demand for tickets always outstripped supply.
In the past two years, estimates Jardine Fleming Securities, the Hong
Kong-based brokerage, Asian airlines increased capacity by between 10 and 12
per cent a year while demand rose by only about 7 per cent a year.
With orders for aircraft made at least two years in advance, the airlines
clearly misread the effects of global recession on the Asian market - a
predicament worsened by the arrival of overseas competitors.
Mr Eddington of Cathay Pacific claims the influx of overseas airlines will
be short-lived: 'Airlines had too much capacity and they have dumped a lot
of that capacity on Asia,' he says. 'They haven't made any money flying
those aircraft to Asia, but they have lost less than they would from flying
them to North America or Europe.'
The new competitors, primarily US airlines led by United, disagree and have
been clamouring for more 'open skies' - that is, access to the highly
profitable restricted routes operated by Asian airlines, such as Hong Kong
to Taipei, which is dominated by Cathay Pacific and Taiwan's flag carrier,
China Airlines.
Mr Roddy Wilson, Far East general manager for British Airways, says western
airlines see a long-term future in south-east Asia. 'The increase in
capacity underlines the fact that the ability to grow is there. It is likely
to reduce yields, but I would have thought that is normal in every industry;
those who ordered too much capacity will just have to shake that out.'
The second challenge facing south-east Asian airlines is the pressure on
costs caused by the strong performances of the region's economies. In an
effort to control salary bills, airlines based in the more developed
economies have taken on cabin crew from cheaper Asian labour pools, such as
the Philippines or India. Cathay has moved some labour intensive operations
into China.
But costs will remain hard to control in Singapore, Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan and Hong Kong, as these countries complete the evolution from
low-cost manufacturing centres to higher value-added service economies.
Shrinking profit margins may eventually be offset by the emergence of new
high-growth markets, such as China, Vietnam and Indonesia. But it will prove
difficult for south-east Asia's airlines to relive the golden years of the
late 1980s.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Priority for public transport the
cure for road congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Gummer, the UK environment secretary, is right to propose road
pricing as a means to internalise external costs and thus reduce congestion
in London. He would be wrong, however, to follow Mr John MacGregor, the UK
transport secretary, by earmarking the corresponding revenues to fund new
road building schemes ('Minister hints at road-pricing to beat London jams',
September 21, and 'MacGregor gets show on the road', September 22,
respectively).
As the American economist Anthony Downs found out some 30 years ago, 'on
urban commuter expressways, peak-hour traffic congestion rises to meet
maximum capacity'. In other words, congestion, at least in the medium run,
is rather independent of the number of roads (or lanes) available.
Instead, the government should be satisfied with having found an
efficiency-increasing form of taxation or, better still, use the money to
pay for public transport improvements which have been overdue for a long
time anyway. These would both reduce overcrowding on trains and, thus, by
making public transport more attractive, ease road congestion even further.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Industry must play part in technology
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I welcome Paul Ruskin's letter about the 'technology foresight
programme' (September 20). We all agree that the UK - including both private
and public sector funders of research and development - should benefit from
a clear vision of priorities.
I agree with much of Mr Ruskin's general argument. Decisions need to be
taken by industry on where the UK ought to try to be a world leader, where
it might do better to collaborate, and where it would do better to buy in
technology.
The government's white paper on science, engineering and technology,
Realising our Potential, sets out how a new working partnership should be
developed between scientists and industrialists to assess the significance
of emerging technological trends and market opportunities.
Key factors in considering priorities will no doubt need to be whether there
are strong market signals that a technology can improve our competitiveness;
whether UK companies can, realistically, hope to capture markets which
depend on the particular technology; and whether our science, engineering
and technology base is judged capable of achieving world leadership, or
parity, in the technology.
I have initiated a series of consultative seminars on the best way to
organise a 'technology foresight programme'. It is essential that industry
and other users of research are fully involved and in the driving seat in
this exciting new exercise, particularly to ensure that it is sufficiently
responsive to market pull and not just technology push. We will then need to
weigh up the objective evidence in the light of the consultation process,
assess expert views as widely as possible, and come to robust conclusions.
I look forward to those conclusions and expect that they will provide the UK
with a clearer grasp of strategic priorities than we currently have.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Revival of Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PICKARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your balanced leader on the Tower Hamlets British National party vote
is welcome ('A shiver in east London', September 20). It is vital that the
concern generated by this event does not shield the positive changes shaping
and improving Docklands and east London.
When the docks finally closed in 1980, the local community here faced no
investment opportunities and high unemployment but their strong sense of
identity remained. If that position had continued, the community would have
had just cause for feeling there was little hope as there were poor
communications, little suitable job training, and only modest educational
opportunities.
Now, with very substantial commercial investment, and much better job
opportunities, especially as the recession ends, there is indeed good reason
to be optimistic. Better communications and the new airport, better public
transport, housing improvement and more opportunities for home ownership,
are all helping to secure the long-term future for residents. There were
27,000 jobs in Docklands in 1981 and the number was falling. We have secured
55,000 now, and the number is rising. There were about 1,000 businesses and
there are nearly 2,500 now. Canary Wharf, for example, has made particular
efforts to target job opportunities on local residents with almost 800 local
people so far finding work at Canary Wharf during the course of the project.
Unfortunately, there are no data linking jobs to residents for the total
55,000 jobs.
Change inevitably brings some tension as we have to adjust to new
technologies, different job opportunities and new life styles, and
sensitively deal with the housing and educational priorities demanded by
demographic and ethnic change. All of us who are committed to improving this
area, including ourselves, Tower Hamlets Council, and many other
organisations, work closely together to try to deal positively with change
and growth. We are confident that we shall succeed both in making this area
an economic success and in promoting a harmonious community, but this
requires continuous effort, particularly to improve educational achievement.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Arts: Back to Beijing for bohemian principles - Lynn
MacRitchie admires Chinese avant-garde art, finding it full of
contradictions put to artistic use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visiting young artists in China sometimes seems like going back in time, to
Paris in the early years of this century, perhaps, when the creators of what
was to become modern art were starving in hovels as they made their history
changing experiments.
In Beijing today there is an 'Artists Village' on the very western edge of
the city, where a large group of painters, sculptors, writers and poets live
the sort of bohemian life no longer much practised in the survival conscious
west, where economic strategies are as much a part of artists' conversation
as developments in their work.
In 1993, however, even in China, such a community could not remain unknown
for long. Some of the residents, although unrecognised by the artistic
authorities who do not allow their work to be exhibited in the city, are
already regular exhibitors in the west, the US and Australia, their
untaxable income - since the authorities do not recognise them, neither can
they profit from them - from sales at western prices making them part of
Beijing's new rich.
'China Avant-Garde', the second part of the exhibition of Chinese
contemporary art at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, gives an opportunity
to see the work of artists who for the most part are still living in their
homeland. Some are employed as art teachers or designers, some are proud to
be 'living as independent artists.' This position, like so many in the
rapidly changing China of today is one filled with contradictions, something
the artists themselves are well aware of and which in some cases provides a
powerful theme in their work.
All kinds of art work are practised and represented in the show. A form of
realistic painting holds an important place, however. Fang Lijun and Liu
Wei, both painters and two of the participants from China in the Venice
Biennale this year, told me they had been disappointed by some of the work
they saw there, complaining that it was too difficult to understand and
seemed too far removed from everyday life.
Both Fang Lijun and Liu Wei work from life, as captured in informal
photographs of family and friends. Fang Lijun uses his own image worked
large and repeated to create a world of anonymous figures against neutral
backgrounds such as the sky, water or the sea, elements which he describes
as being both very familiar and completely unknowable. The compositions
suggest oppression and dread, the smiling figures both appealing and
threatening, a potential brutality lurking beneath the placid and
beautifully drawn surface.
Liu Wei uses his immediate family as his subjects. By depicting them with
brutal clarity in compositions which include the bits and pieces of everyday
life - dad in his army uniform in front of a TV set showing Beijing opera,
for example, or the elder brother grinning as he shows off his baby next to
a grotesque toy deer, Liu Wei captures the absurdities of life in a society
which has destroyed the meaning of the achievements of the past but faces
the future with confusion: if you want to know what life in Beijing really
feels like, look at these pictures.
Another important school of painting is political pop, whose most famous
representative is Wang Guangyi. He too is influenced by what he sees in the
streets. We are used to our streets being full of images, he told me, but
the billboards once painted with political slogans and exhortations are now
covered with the famous names he uses in his pictures, combining the heroic
workers, peasants and soldiers of 'Maoist realism' with Benetton, Kodak,
Coca Cola and Marlboro. He points out that he does not celebrate the
consumer objects as the American pop artists did, but wishes to make his
audience think about the culture clash which has thrown his world into
turmoil, producing a strain of nostalgic idealism which has made Chairman
Mao into a genuine people's hero for the first time, patron saint of the
hustling taxi drivers who clog the capital's streets.
Other artists, such as Ni Haifeng, who lives on an island 12 hours sailing
time from Shanghai covering rocks and stones in the landscape with writing
and numbers, combine their knowledge of Western conceptual or performance
work with study of ancient Chinese traditions. At a time when all is flux,
the need to grasp on to something which retains integrity is strong.
It is sobering to reflect that the get rich quick jungle which is China
today emerged directly from the devastation of the Cultural Revolution,
economic liberalisation the party's next tactic to retain power at any
price.
While most of China's citizens, with survival their uppermost concern, obey
the new commands just as they obeyed the old, some of her artists are
exploring what it really feels like to be Chinese today, telling the truth
about their experience in a way that has simply never happened before.
Throughout the history of Chinese culture, the individual has had little
significance and less power. As China faces the future, this will have to
change. Her avant-garde artists, wary, cynical, talented and tough, are at
the forefront of this transition.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Arts: The Destiny of Me - Theatre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Italian clothes manufacturer and retailer Benetton is to take its
non-product advertising into Aids awareness. Three new images, a male
buttock, a female torso and an upper arm are tattooed 'HIV POSITIVE'.
Prevention like this works, but the problem for those now dying of Aids is
the slowness of the cure. Larry Kramer's play The Destiny of Me at the
Leicester Haymarket Theatre presents a man with Aids who asks 'What do you
do when you are dying of a disease you need not be dying from?' Kramer has
based the action on his remarkable life.
At over 3 1/2 hours, The Destiny of Me makes a boring, frustrating play,
albeit on two compelling subjects: Aids and Kramer's homosexuality. This is
so nearly fine drama, but the issues need to be focussed; they are too
important to speak for themselves. At present the play is a combination of
Neil Simon's jewish lore (Brighton Beach Memoirs), James Purdy's angry 1980s
gay novels and Marvin's Room (now at the Comedy Theatre, Panton St), a play
about leukemia by Scott McPherson (who died of Aids at 33 last year).
In 1981 Kramer founded Gay Men's Health Crisis, and in 1987 the Aids
Coalition To Unleash Power. His writing, especially Faggots, a novel about
New York gay life and The Normal Heart, his 1988 Aids play (Public Theatre
and The Royal Court), has brought gay health issues into the public domain.
Here, Kramer's autobiographical action centres on Ned, an Aids activist now
ill in a New York hospital. Outside, demonstrators rail against inadequate
government research provision, while inside, Dr Della Vida (nice pun) tries
the latest blood transfusions. Ned travels back in time. His family past
appears in the clinic, and we see scenes from Ned's childhood. Here are the
roots of Ned's homosexuality. His disappointed father, his indulgent mother,
his vigorously heterosexual brother make up a dysfunctional family which
bore the added burden of anti-semitism in the 1950s. Past and present are
intercut. Ned has blood transfusions while his past self picnics with the
family; his mother recounts a miscarriage and his father rants 'You were a
mistake, I didn't want you, I never wanted you.'
Gradually the play takes shape, making more sense of the repetitive familial
anguish and disclosure. But Kramer then tries to link complacency in
Washington with the advance of a virus in the bloodstream. Dr Della Vida
says: 'The President cares. He has a heart. He really wants this disease to
go away.' There was laughter in the theatre. Kramer presents gay men like
Ned as politically empowered but pathologically passive.
Simon Callow (who also directs) finds range and passion in the lead role.
James Kennedy as his younger self and Jason Durr as his brother carry off
the play's best scene, where Ned 'comes out', and Ned's mother (Ann
Mitchell) asks the best question of the evening: 'Is sex what controls your
life?' In hospital, Patti Boulaye is underemployed as a nurse, all Upper
East side chic and Lower East side mouth; her husband the Doctor (Peter
Woodward) personifies the embattled health services.
Aids has taxed belief in progress and rationality. Kramer conveys the
madness of the alternatives: 'Why do I never stop believing a cure will be
found for this plague?' Larry Kramer is HIV positive.

Are gardens created by women so very different or more distinctive to those
created by men that BBC2 is justified in making a series called An
Englishwoman's Garden? We can find out at 8.30 when the series begins with a
look at four gardens - or can we? Sybil Spencer's garden was originally
created by her son and husband and Frieda Brown's garden in Leeds is also
the responsibility of Joe Brown. This is an intriguing start for the series.
ITV begins another of those series which seek big ratings and a socially
useful purpose - 'Crimewatch' is an obvious example. Missing (9.00) kicks
off with the somewhat startling fact that 250,000 people in Britain
disappear each year. In trying to track down missing persons the programme
will, like 'Crimewatch', use 'dramatic reconstruction'.
It is difficult to guess whether fans of opera or of animation will want to
watch BBC2's new series Animated Arias. The series will provide 12
five-minute films, shown in pairs. Today, two familiar lollipops: 'Vesti la
giubba' from 'Pagliacci' and 'La donna e mobile' from Rigoletto (9.50).

FT  24 SEP 93 / Arts: Leipzig cramps the Nash - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visibly, the Nash Ensemble's loyal audience grows ever more ancient; and in
the first concert of their Wigmore Hall season on Wednesday, the Ensemble
sounded fairly crumbly too. Perhaps they were disheartened by the prospect
before them. Until January, they are committed to a 'Leipzig Gewandhaus
250th Anniversary Series' - and it is a nonsense.
The introductory programme note promised re-creations of chamber
music-making in the Gewandhaus hall, from Mendelssohn's time as conductor of
its great orchestra to the late 19th century. In fact the next three
concerts will consist exclusively of hyper-familiar standards by Mozart,
Brahms, and Mendelssohn, with a trio by the latter's colleague Niels Gade
(1817-90) as prelude to the Mozart clarinet quintet on a January morning.
Far from extending the Nash's range (or ours), this series cramps it
cruelly: no room for any new works, nor the serious rediscoveries - usually
French - for which we love them.
This first concert was slightly more adventurous, but to no great purpose.
To hear a piano sextet by the Englishman William Sterndale Bennett
(1816-75), a protege of the leading German composers of his day, we had to
arrive by 6. The main concert at 7.30, in which Mozart and Mendelssohn
evergreens were cushioned by a Spohr romance, a Weber song, and seven
soprano solos and duets by Rossini (no doubt Rossini was heard in Leipzig:
but so what?), ran on long past 10 o'clock. By then a sizeable fraction of
the audience had gone.
The Sterndale Bennett sextet, with a graceful introduction from his
great-great-grandson Barry, seemed a well-schooled piece of real talent. How
much talent was hard to judge - for it is almost a mini-piano-concerto, and
Ian Brown sounded imperfectly familiar with the piano part (most
uncharacteristic of him, but all too plain). One could only guess at what a
more assured performance might find in the music. In Mendelssohn's second
book of Songs without Words later, Brown proved beyond doubt that their
essential vein of dewily lyrical, knowing innocence is not his vein.
Not with his plonking touch] - and certainly not on the Wigmore's big,
booming Bosendorfer, the like of which was never heard until long after
Mendelssohn died. Transcriptions of the 'Songs' for the Albert Hall organ
would have been no more implausible. Brown is happier with notes that come
thicker and faster; he was far more at home with his dashing role in the D
minor Trio, but for the mild violin and cello his Bosendorfer loomed like a
hungry whale over minnows. Earlier, Mozart's great G minor string quintet
got a decently musical performance, though the long accompanying passages
for strings throbbing in unison were chronically untidy.
The songs were all right. If Lillian Watson's coloratura is more casual
about pitch than it used to be, and the new-found depth of Lynn Dawson's
soprano was unsuited to her airy Spohr, they still collaborated fetchingly
in Rossini. Nevertheless, the whole protracted farrago lacked any point: it
was a re-creation of nothing, it shed no new light on anything, and by the
honourable Nash standards it was not distinguished playing. Hand on heart, I
should say that only the cellist Christopher van Kampen's bass line gave me
consistent musical pleasure.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Arts: Blood and thunder electrify Docklands - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There must be better places than Dockland's Cabot Hall to hold a jazz music
festival. Sarajevo is probably more accessible. Heathrow's Eurolounge
possesses a more convivial ambience. Even the political atmosphere is
repellant to jazz, the far right having recently taken the local authority
seat. Those of us who did make it to the mausoleum were rewarded, however,
by the sight and sound of decadent music at its electrifying best.
The last time I saw guitarist James Blood Ulmer it was against a background
of rolling thunder and rain like stair rods in the dark, outdoors at Brecon.
It is possible that he carries this sort of weather with him because so it
was again on the Isle of Dogs, where his stage backdrop was a neon and rain
soaked cityscape overlit with sheet lightning.
This time the one man electrical storm had brought fellow harmolodocian and
reedsman Sam Rivers with him and a rhythm section of drums (Doug Hammond)
and plucked cello (Mooni Abdul Farah). The sound sculptures created by the
quartet are not immediately gratifying: Ulmer, working a semi-acoustic sends
shards of notes flying from the thumb, constricted chords creating a tension
relieved by River's more open, but still abstract blowing. Hammon's drums
and Frah's cello (improbably mounted on a three foot spike to allow him to
stand) churn menacingly behind.
But surrender yourself to the leader's dissonance and strangulated pitch,
and the funk and raw blues emotion is hypnotic. Like his mentor, altoist
Ornette Coleman, the guitarist suspends his claustrophobic sound from an
innate sense of time. Rivers, looking like a leather-clad pipe cleaner man,
cut through the fog with plaintive soprano scribbling and shrill flight with
the flute. The use of bowed and plucked cello in place of bass adds to the
tragic majesty of the work. Hendrix would have loved it.
Sponsor: Texaco. Docklands Jazz Festival continues with Jools Holland Big
Band (Fri); Bill Bruford's Earthworks and Julian Joseph Qt (Sat); Jazz
Warriors and Jazz Jamaica (Sun 3pm, free)

FT  24 SEP 93 / Technology: A quicker pace - NCR's automated teller division
led the competition of today, but feared for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Adamson, who runs the worldwide automated teller machine business of US
multinational NCR, now part of AT&amp;T, says that when in 1990 it compared its
performance with that of rival ATM manufacturers, he found the conclusions
frightening. 'Our bench-marking showed that by most yardsticks we were far
ahead of our competitors. And I didn't like it.'
What frightened him, he says, was the knowledge that despite success, the
operation which he runs from NCR's plant in Dundee was still taking as much
as five years to bring products from conception to the market.
Although that was sufficient to beat its current competitors, 'there is a
danger in business that you only look at your present competitors,' Adamson
says. 'What would happen if companies from other industries with better
product innovation - such as Japanese car makers - moved into our industry?'
Adamson's concern led NCR in 1991 to hire the consultants Pittiglio Rabin
Todd &amp; McGrath (PRTM), who advise on operations management in both the US
and Europe, to help speed up its product innovation. NCR now claims that
after a painful culture change, its innovation lead times have been
shortened by up to 40 per cent.
NCR's ATMs were already beginning to achieve dominant market positions and
by the end of 1992 some 65 per cent of the ATMs installed in Europe and 39
per cent worldwide had been made in Dundee. Last year, the plant shipped 53
per cent of all ATMs sold worldwide. This year, NCR's ATM business, worth
about Dollars 1.29bn (Pounds 830m), is growing by 20 to 25 per cent, as it
outpaces its biggest competitor, InterBold of the US. It has increased its
Dundee workforce by 300 to 1,600.
Yet the third and fourth generation NCR ATMs on which this performance is
based took several years to reach the market, after a process which Adamson
says was inefficient and long-winded. Product ideas originated with the
marketing department, went to engineering to be designed, then on to
manufacturing to be produced, before coming back to marketing.
It was when the first models had been built that the customers' verdict was
sought. This led to design changes which had to go through the manufacturing
process. 'We didn't feel we had to get it right first time,' says Adamson.
Whereas the old system proceeded serially, 'with lots of dotting back and
forth between the stages,' Adamson says, under the new system, which the
consultants call Pace (product and cycle-time excellence), the processes run
in parallel.
A core team of six or seven people is set up to handle the development of a
new product, the idea for which may come from marketing, engineering, other
departments or from the customer. The team includes representatives not just
of engineering but of manufacturing, quality control, servicing and
marketing.
'The involvement of all these disciplines means that you get individual
engineers thinking through the business case from a customer's point of
view,' says Adamson. 'That view comes via the marketing representative,
based on regular contact with customers.
'Pace means that ideas that may seem good to engineers but don't appeal to
customers are weeded out at an early stage. The involvement of the
manufacturing department could mean that a feature that may be difficult to
build or make the product awkward to ship emerges at an early stage,'
Adamson says.
The core team is monitored by the product approval committee, a permanent
body which includes senior executives such as the directors of engineering,
finance, quality, human resources, marketing and technology. It has to
authorise funding for each phase, from the initial evaluation of the concept
by the core team, through the hammering out of a design requirement, to the
development phase.
Adamson says that under Pace most of the hard work put into the development
process by senior executives comes in the early stages. 'There's an awful
lot of arguing to get through but all the different stages that used to take
place along the way are compressed into a short time. That means that much
less senior executive time is needed as the product comes closer to reaching
the market.'
Pace can mean that projects get killed at an earlier stage. Of the two pilot
projects to which NCR applied Pace, one was Adamson's pet scheme for a
low-cost cash dispenser. The core team evaluating it judged it not to meet
customer requirements and recommended not going ahead in its original form.
The decision saved Dollars 5m of development funding.
'That would never have happened in the past,' says Alison Armstrong,
vice-president for self-service software systems. 'It would have been seen
as cancelling a project. Now it's seen as applying R&amp;D effectively.'
Adamson says: 'Pace means more freedom of speech and more freedom of action.
Under the old system it was very difficult to cancel projects because we
would already have spent a lot of money on them and the people involved
fought for them because they were afraid they would lose their jobs. Now the
core team feels that if a project is cancelled it can get on with something
more worthwhile.'
The other pilot project was a software package for monitoring and
controlling a network of ATMs, which was reckoned to be three times as
complex as the previous one from which it was derived. But whereas the
earlier version took 108 weeks to bring from concept to market, the new
package was developed in 65 weeks, a 40 per cent saving.
However, the introduction of Pace, in which PRTM staff acted as
facilitators, was traumatic, Adamson admits. 'It was a cultural change,' he
says. 'We had to break down barriers between different disciplines. You had
engineers saying: how we do our job is nothing to do with quality control or
with production engineers.'
Armstrong says that some of the most painful changes affected Adamson
himself, who is quick-thinking, decisive and charismatic. 'Jim had to stop
himself from taking too many decisions and leave them to the core teams.'
Now Adamson only gets involved in critical business decisions, as a member
of the product approval committee, rather then matters of product detail.
Adamson says: 'When we were a smaller organisation, I was making all the
decisions. Now I am coach and counsellor to aid decision-making.' The Pace
process of product development, which PRTM had introduced to offshoots of
other US multinationals before it came to NCR's self-service division at
Dundee, is now being adopted byfive other divisions of NCR, and in two
divisions of NCR's parent AT&amp;T.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Technology: Fighting those phobias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TECHNO-PHOBIA,' says Dan Gookin, 'is a sign of our times.' Anyone who has
fumbled with the controls on a video recorder, become confused by the
digital display on a camera, or cursed at a computer will know what he
means.
Encouragingly for a country still struggling out of a harsh recession,
people in Britain are somewhat more comfortable with today's technology than
those in France, Germany or the US. While 55 per cent of French, 50 per cent
of German, and 55 per cent of US adults and teenagers are techno-phobic, the
figure for Britain is 46 per cent.
The findings come from research by Dell Computer of the US. Gookin, a US
author who has written books such as PCs for Dummies for those who shy away
from anything mechanical or electronic, reckons technology has passed many
people by.
Commenting on the research, he says: 'One of the main reasons many people
are paranoid about technology is that no one in the industry has bothered to
help them understand how simple it is to use and what it specifically can do
for them. Most manuals are as difficult to understand as a graduate-level
course in quantum physics.'
Not surprisingly, Dell's research shows younger people are less afraid of
technology than their elders. The fact that it carried out the research at
all is a sign that computer companies are increasingly nervous that business
and individual users may be left behind by the bewildering pace of
development in the jargon-ridden world of information technology.
Increasingly, therefore, computer and software companies try to highlight
the benefits and applications of their products rather than the
technological content. But managers steeped in the fast-evolving world of
electronics often find it hard to keep their message clear.

Vehicle theft is a growth industry. But while most people's attention is
focused on car security, truck and trailer users are increasingly concerned
about protecting heavier vehicles.
To combat theft of truck loads, trucks and trailers, David Bramley
Engineering has developed a range of precision products which fit on to the
vehicle. Among them is the Bramley Trucklock, which fits into the parking
brake circuit and locks the braking system with a 10-pin high-security lock
offering 1m different key cuts.
Other products protect the trailer's king-pin and brake line coupling to
prevent thieves towing the unit away. David Bramley Engineering: UK, 0602

FT  24 SEP 93 / People: Miller Knight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Cleary and Jim Magee are to join the board of Miller Knight, the
chartered loss adjusters, following the shake-up of the Merrett Group in the
past few weeks.
Cleary becomes executive chairman and Magee chief executive with effect from
October 11. Barry Whyte continues as managing director.
The appointments come after pressure for changes within the group of
insurance companies headed by Stephen Merrett, who recently resigned as
deputy chairman of Lloyd's, the insurance market. Merrett agreed to a number
of changes over the summer including appointing new directors and resigning
as chairman of Merrett Underwriting Agency Management, another part of
Merrett Holdings.
Miller Knight has been involved in part of the restructuring, which has
included the introduction of computer systems and improving the overall
management of the company.
Both Cleary and Magee were group managing directors of Thomas Howell, where
Cleary was deputy chairman. When they left the company two years ago they
signed an agreement to remain out of the industry. That agreement has now
expired.
Cleary is a past president of the Chartered Insurance Institute and of the
Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters.

FT  24 SEP 93 / People: Davies to chair Health Commission
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Davies who, as president of the Glass Manufacturers' Federation,
doubled the amount of glass to be re-cycled in four years, has been
appointed the new chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, one of the
few remaining tripartite bodies involving the government, unions and
employers.
He succeeds Sir John Cullen, who retires next week after 10 years in the
post.
According to Michael Forsyth, minister for employment, who made the
appointment, 'Frank Davies has a distinguished record of achievement in
industry and a long standing interest in health and safety matters.'
Davies has been chief executive of the Rockware group since 1983. After the
sale of the company to BTR Nylex, he also became chairman of BTR Nylex's
European division and a member of the board of British Nylex Australia. He
was founder chairman of the Nuffield Orthopaedic Trust, president of St John
Ambulance Oxfordshire North for 20 years and was a member of the Oxfordshire
district health authority from 1981 to 1990.
The Health and Safety Executive, which advises the commission, yesterday
said that it had re-appointed John Rimington as its director-general.
Rimington has been director general of the executive since January 1984. He
is on loan to the HSE from the civil service where he holds the personal
rank of second permanent secretary in the department of employment.

FT  24 SEP 93 / People: Arriving before the milk float
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dairy Crest, the food-processing arm of the Milk Marketing Board, has
appointed a new finance director to steer the company through its flotation
next February and its new role in a free milk market. David Harding joins
the company's board on October 11 from his current position as deputy
finance director of the TI engineering group.
A former civil servant at the Treasury, the 46-year-old Harding has worked
for TI Group for the past 13 years; he has held a number of positions
including head of corporate development and managing director of the
company's smaller business division.
He joins the cut-throat dairy industry at a time of rapid change which has
seen the abolition of the government's compulsory purchasing scheme for milk
and the introduction of a free market next April - in which Dairy Crest will
have to compete for milk supplies. It is implementing widespread changes in
corporate culture before flotation.
The company's careful selection of Harding reflects the fact that he has
experienced a similar change in corporate culture at TI - the group has
undergone a huge re-organisation in the past 10 years. Indeed, Harding wrote
an analysis of the process of corporate change which has since become a
discussion paper at Harvard Business School in the US.
Harding is an economics graduate and also worked for IMI before joining TI
in 1980. He replaces David Lewis at Dairy Crest who will retire in a few
months.

After being without a chairman for nine months, Britain's DESIGN COUNCIL
will have a new one in January: John Sorrell, a 48-year-old designer and
businessman who, with his wife Frances Newell, runs Newell and Sorrell, a
successful 45-person corporate identity consultancy best known for British
Rail's InterCity identity and the Royal Mail's ParcelForce.
His first task, as deputy chairman for the rest of this year, will be the
painful one of planning the orderly transfer of most of the Council's
activities to other arms of government. But he was brimming with enthusiasm
yesterday at that challenge, and the more positive prospect of creating the
high-powered research and campaigning body which the rump of the Council
will become.
'I want to contribute because I care enormously about the way design can
help the performance of UK plc - especially manufacturing industry, but also
education and society as a whole,' he says.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Management: Big Blue soothes its big investors - IBM's board
of directors has established a corporate governance sub-committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boardroom changes at IBM and Eastman Kodak, two of the US's largest
companies, have underscored the growing muscle of both non-executive
directors and activist shareholders in US corporate life.
IBM, under its chairman, Lou Gerstner, has become the first large US company
to set up a sub-committee of the board devoted to matters of 'corporate
governance' - that is to say, the framework within which the business makes
decisions and the role of shareholders in influencing policy.
At Kodak, non-executive directors last month ousted Kay Whitmore, the
chairman and chief executive, for not moving with sufficient aggression to
improve the company's lacklustre performance.
The directors' coup at Kodak was the latest in a series which has toppled
chief executives at an extraordinary number of poorly performing blue chip
US companies, including IBM, General Motors, American Express and
Westinghouse Electric.
The non-executives at these companies were responding, at least in part, to
growing pressure from institutional shareholders to produce a sharply
improved financial performance. In the past, the outside directors at many
US companies tended to be fairly passive followers of the lead set by
management.
Now, however, big investors are insisting directors fulfil the function they
were elected to carry out: acting as fiduciaries on behalf of shareholders,
making sure management runs the company efficiently and on their behalf.
The leaders of this 'corporate governance movement' want boards to give more
power to non-executives. For example, a common demand is that new directors
are nominated by a committee composed of outsiders. And the institutions are
insisting that their views on both governance issues and strategy are given
more weight, particularly at companies producing poor financial results.
The IBM initiative represents a novel way of tackling this challenge, and
seems to be Gerstner's response to strong shareholder criticism of the
board's passivity under John Akers, who was forced to resign as chairman
last spring because of the group's poor performance.
Gerstner, keen to improve relations with investors, encouraged the board to
create a new 'directors and corporate governance committee' composed of
non-executive directors. It will be presided over by James Burke, former
chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson and the man who led the search for a new chief
executive when Akers was ousted.
The committee will review the size, composition and functions of the board
and board committees, as well as retirement policies towards non-executive
directors and their pay.
It will also review and respond to significant proposals from shareholders
and oversee the company's position on issues of public responsibility, such
as equal employment opportunities and protection of the environment.
Finally, it will nominate new board directors, and as part of the process
will evaluate any recommendations from shareholders.
Cari Christian, executive director of the United Shareholders Association,
an activist umbrella organisation, said: 'We are very supportive of what
they (IBM) are doing. The company needed to be more aware of shareholders
and communicate with them . . . I think you're going to see more and more
companies moving in this direction.'
There is a danger that corporate governance committees could be used by
strong managements as a public relations exercise, to suggest a willingness
to involve shareholders where none really exists.
James Heard, president of Washington-based Institutional Shareholder
Services (ISS), which advises large investors on corporate governance
issues, says: 'I could see such a committee as little more than window
dressing, or as quite formidable if it were the point of contact with
shareholders pressing for change.'
But while governance committees could reduce shareholders' dealings with
executive directors, this does not seem to worry the activists.
DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer at the California Public Employees
Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in the US, says: 'We feel
the principal contact should be between shareholders and directors.
Directors represent shareholder interests . . . Where we have achieved most
success in dealing with a company has been through working through
directors.'
However, shareholder groups seem unlikely to issue blanket demands that
other companies follow the IBM model. Bowman notes that most situations are
company-specific.
Heard says the fact that a company recognises the need for better relations
with shareholders, and is doing something about this, is more important than
the specific structure it adopts. He points to Kodak as an example of a
company taking a somewhat different approach to IBM.
Kodak's non-executive directors were so concerned with the company's
performance and mounting investor ire that they formed a special board
committee at the start of this year to take a more active role in group
strategy or, as they called it, 'corporate directions'.
Last month, frustrated by Whitmore's slow pace in restructuring the business
and giving it a clear sense of direction, they told him he had to go.
The coup differed from those at other blue chip companies in one interesting
respect. In their public statements, the directors made no secret of the
fact that Whitmore had been forced out and the reasons for this. They also
let it be known that he had been under pressure from the board to perform
better for the past two years.
This may not have left Whitmore with a great deal of dignity, but it sent a
significant message from directors to shareholders: we acknowledge your
concern and we want to communicate more openly.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Management: The Design Council on a crash diet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTEMS have a nasty habit of being toppled. Three months ago, in the latest
chapter of extensive deliberations in Washington on how the Clinton
Administration can help improve the quality of design in US industry,
Britain's 49-year-old Design Council was held up as a possible model. Along
with his counterparts from much more richly-funded Taiwan and Japan, the
Council's director-general was one of the main foreign speakers at a
three-day talk-in of adminstration officials and other interested parties.
But yesterday, the British government served notice on large parts of the
Council's activities, on the grounds that some no longer fit the public
sector, and that others should be integrated into its own multi-purpose
network of 'Business Link' advice centres around the UK.
In particular, the Council's direct delivery of various consultancy services
to industry will be transferred or sold off during the course of the next
year or so. Instead, the Council's work will be refocused on the provision
of high-quality analysis and advice on every aspect of design: to all arms
of government, to industry, to intermediate bodies, to education, and to the
design community. The industry minister expects it to be 'the nation's
design conscience'.
The exact size, shape and role of the Council's activities will be
determined over the next few months by a review team under John Sorrell, the
chairman-designate, himself a designer and successful businessman. But it is
clear that the new Council will be ultra-slimline, shrunk to a fraction of
its current staff of 220 to somewhere between 20 and 50. Government funding
will also be much lower than the current annual Pounds 7.5m, possibly Pounds
2m-Pounds 3m.
In the cold light of dawn, how should the decision be interpreted? Should
Britain's design community and the Council's 22 members - myself among them
 -feel betrayed or relieved?
Far more important, what impact will the move have on the readiness and
ability of British industry to make better use of design, which is an
increasingly important competitive weapon, now that technology, quality,
service and other 'non-price factors' are becoming little more than tickets
for entering the international marketplace, rather than weapons for winning
in it?
As Ford has found with its Taurus car in America, Rover with its latest
model range, and Apple with its PowerBook laptop computer, the character and
'feel' of a product or service, as well as its performance - what Japanese
academics call its 'integrity' and 'ability to delight' - can make all the
difference.
There will be two types of reaction to what pessimists will dub the
'dismemberment' of the Council, and the optimists its 'refocusing'. The
first group will cry 'disaster', and point to the hundreds of millions of
dollars which the governments of Taiwan, Korea, Japan and a few other
countries are pouring into design. In spite of yesterday's strong official
protestations to the contrary, they will fear that the Council will
ultimately disappear.
The second group, in which I include myself, will argue that a body like the
Council must be just as ready to undergo radical change as the
constituencies which it serves. Countless private- and public-sector
organisations in Britain are being torn up by the roots and their
justification for existence examined.
There is every reason to think that a slim, high-powered research,
evangelising and lobbying organisation can win friends and influence
decision-makers in business, government, management education and elsewhere.
On a smallish scale, just such a role has been played in the US to great
effect for several years by the Boston-based Design Management Institute, a
private-sector body. The research, publications, conferences and exhibitions
organised by its entrepreneurial, close-knit team, on a budget of less than
Dollars 1m a year, have given it - and its message - a high profile across
corporate America, and in Washington. With more federal funds, which may
soon be provided, it would perform better still.
In retrospect, the Design Council might have been treated more kindly by
Whitehall if it had managed to restore the high-profile campaigning image
for which it was noted in the 1970s, and which the government now wants
revived and redirected at the business world. Those of us who, behind its
closed doors, expressed discomfort at its drift away from its roots in
industrial design towards an excessive concern with engineering, should have
been much noisier.
On the other hand, there was little wrong with the Council's regionalisation
of most of its industrial services, in order to reach the grass roots, nor
with its materials for schoolchildren - which win high praise from teachers
and students alike. But it paid too little attention to the parallel need to
convince opinion-formers that design is an exciting, glamorous activity
which can transform corporate fortunes.
What matters now are five things: that the review team completes its task
rapidly; that the government then funds the slimline Council adequately;
that Whitehall ensures that activities transferred from the Council do not
sink without trace in their new homes - quite a problem, since the first
Business Links are only just being piloted; that good staff move with their
jobs; and that the government makes it clear that it is prepared to
strengthen the design component of its various support schemes for
innovation.
Such steps are needed, along with a much greater design effort on the part
of industry itself, if - like Rover - British business is to be able to
compete with its increasingly design-intensive competitors from Europe,
North America and East Asia.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Property: SPOTs that fail to leave a mark - Turning debt
into securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Securitisation . . . has its appeal. It removes financial assets from the
balance sheets of institutions, reduces property exposure, and potentially
frees up capital for new lending . . . At the retail end, we could soon see
the fuller development of those vehicles that had begun to emerge in the
late 1980s, such as SAPCOs, APUTs AND PINCS . . . the debate on SPOTs
continues'
Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England
This endorsement of securitisation - the transformation of property debt
into a tradeable security - has struck a chord. It is a subject receiving
close attention from property financiers attracted by the prospect of
offloading some of the Pounds 36bn of debt outstanding to the industry; of
injecting more sophistication into the market; and, not least, of its
potential for generating fees.
There have been several securitisations in the UK; Rosehaugh Stanhope
Development, raised Dollars 180m in 1991 in the US commercial property
market to refinance one of its Broadgate developments, while the BHH Group
issued the first bonds backed by UK commercial property mortgages to be sold
in the Euromarkets in 1990.
The scale of UK commercial property securitisations is small compared with
the US, where the savings and loans debacle in the 1980s, generated the
securitisation of Dollars 20bn of commercial mortgages.
One difference between securitisation in the UK and the US may be attitude
of banks; US banks, faced with tougher regulators, have been more willing to
crystallise their losses.
Another obstacle in the UK is the higher costs involved in structuring the
deal. 'There seems to be an idea that the costs are prohibitive,' says Mr
Mark Burton of United Bank of Kuwait, who heads a working party on
securitisation for the Association of Property Bankers. He remains
optimistic that the problems can be overcome.
The related debate on unitisation - the process of splitting the equity in a
building into marketable parcels - has also provoked enthusiasm, tempered by
some scepticism.
For the enthusiasts, the upturn in the market and the buoyancy of equities
provide fresh opportunities for unitisation. They believe there is untapped
demand for property from investors who do not want the management problems
of direct ownership and who believe property shares are an inadequate
alternative to owning property outright.
But the sceptics doubt the possibility of breathing new life into vehicles
such as Single Asset Property Companies (SAPCOs), Single Property Ownership
Trusts (SPOTs), Authorised Property Unit Trusts (APUTs) and Property Income
Certificates (PINCs), which were devised in the 1980s to improve the
liquidity of property.
The sceptics believe these vehicles are too complex and their credibility
damaged by their failure in the 1980s.
The only innovative instrument from the 1980s still trading is the APUT, but
even their progress has been feeble. Since September 1991 two APUTs have
been launched: Barclays Unicorn Property Trust and Norwich Union Property
Trust. Commercial property's recession-stained image has deterred potential
investors, although the recent upturn in the market has increased
enthusiasm. In August, the Norwich Union Property Trust received Pounds
300,000 from private investors, a 10-fold increase on its monthly average.
Other unitisation vehicles of the 1980s have been even less successful. A
SAPCO was launched in 1988 by Billingsgate City Securities but it provoked
only indifference and was taken off the stock market in 1989.
PINCs have been equally disappointing. One of their problems was their
complexity. 'We were designing the BMW when people were going around in
horse and cart,' says Mr Stephen Barter of Richard Ellis, property advisers.
But PINCs' main problem was one of bad timing. In the two years that PINCs
took to win approval from the Department of Trade and Industry, market
conditions deteriorated, making any launch of a property vehicle
unattractive.
SPOTs, another 1980s' unitisation instrument, also failed to make their
mark, largely because they were not tax efficient. Mr Colin Vaughan of DTZ
Debenham Thorpe, property advisers, still believes in SPOTs. 'Were the
government to take the bit between its teeth and make minor tax changes and
were someone to market it, the conditions would exist in which it could be
successful.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / Property: Commercial property investment returns fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETURNS on commercial property investments fell marginally in August,
according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group, writes
Vanessa Houlder.
The IPD all-property return fell to 1.1 per cent, the result of a reduction
in the rate of capital growth by 0.1 percentage points to 0.4 per cent in
August. Yields were shaved off all sectors in August, although the aggregate
equivalent yield was unchanged at 9.7 per cent.
With the rate of decline in rental values slowing for the fourth consecutive
month, to -0.5 per cent, IPD said there were now indications that the low
point in values was not far off.
Total returns were up to 5.2 per cent, while the rate of decline in capital
and rental values slowed to -3.9 per cent and -10.4 per cent, respectively.
Office and industrial property showed a total return of 1.2 percentage
points in August. Returns on the industrial sector increased by 0.2
percentage points, while office total returns increased by 0.1 percentage
points. Retails fell back into third place, recording a return of 1
percentage point.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Ashdown warns of need to face
challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE Liberal Democrats can rise to the challenge of recent successes,
there need be no limit to its potential support, Mr Paddy Ashdown told the
conference yesterday.
But the leader said the party had to be prepared for fierce scrutiny of its
plans now that it was on the verge of the political 'big time'.
In his 43-minute keynote speech, he also launched a fierce attack on the
Conservatives, saying: 'It is as if we now have an empty room in No 10
Downing Street, as though we have a phantom prime minister.'
Mr Ashdown's central message was that the party had a chance to build on the
hope which it alone inspired in a society in which there was a dangerous
gulf between politicians and people.
But he tempered his optimism with a warning that the whole party could be
damaged by mistakes in local campaigns and local authorities.
His comments were seen as referring to the tactics of local activists in the
London borough of Tower Hamlets. The party is investigating leaflets issued
by Liberal Democrats in the recent council by-election, won by the far right
British National Party.
'Hope is a fragile thing,' Mr Ashdown said. 'It will be as easy for us to
lose as it was hard for us to win.
'If we fail to live up to this opportunity, then this year's success will be
no more than just another third-party surge which rises and dies again . . .
but if we can rise to the challenge, if we can seize our opportunity, then I
promise you there is no 'glass ceiling' for the Liberal Democrats.'
Mr Ashdown portrayed the party's economic stance as a response to the
widespread lack of trust in government.
New ways were needed to involve taxpayers in deciding how much tax should be
raised and how it should be spent. 'No taxation without explanation,' Mr
Ashdown said.
But his most bitter attack on the government came over its conduct of
foreign policy, and in particular Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia, where he
accused it of appeasement.
Later, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, branded Mr Ashdown a
'political tourist' who 'trots round the tragedy in Bosnia, comes back and
makes a speech and grabs a headline'.
Though Mr Ashdown insists that the Liberal Democrats are 'equidistant'
between the other two parties, his sustained attack on the Conservatives
contrasted with the tone of his remarks about Labour.
Mr Ashdown said that Labour had wasted a year in making moves towards
internal democracy and warned the party that the move towards reform would
not wait for it indefinitely.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Delegates lectured on the
facts of political life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE serious and sober mood of the conference this week has been summed up by
the background to the platform: black and grey far outweigh the small
splashes of traditional Liberal Democrat yellow.
A sense of discipline has been imposed from the top. Instead of basking in
the by-election successes of Newbury and Christchurch, and good results in
the county council elections, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, lectured
representatives yesterday about not missing their opportunity.
The appeal to make the most of the chance to turn 'hope into trust . . .
support into confidence . . . protest into power' seems to have two targets.
The first, and most obvious, is the kind of local campaigning tactics which
bring the national party into disrepute. While the accusations of racist
tactics in Tower Hamlets did not derail the conference, the consequent
insistence by speakers throughout the week that racism would not be
tolerated served as a continuing reminder of the level of embarrassment over
the issue.
The second target is national policy-making. While in some ways the
conference has seen a clear shift to the left compared with previous years -
for example over a commitment to full employment, increased caution about
market mechanisms and a hardening of opposition to rail privatisation - the
party has also recognised a need to produce less hostages to fortune.
But the most vivid example was yesterday's vote on pensions. By voting down
a move to uprate pensions in line with earnings, the party passed what the
leadership saw as a political maturity test.
Mr Ashdown went out of his way to congratulate delegates, albeit in the
somewhat double-edged terms of having made a 'courageous' decision.
But there is something eerie in seeing a party whose best prospect at the
next general election is to win up to 40 seats of the 650 at Westminster,
behaving as though its entire spending programme was about to be costed by
Tory Central Office for a campaign starting next week, and to be put into
practice the day after that.
It may be a reflection of Mr Ashdown's view that the present parliament will
not last until the end of its natural life in 1996 or 1997.
There are snares ahead even in the coming months. If the party does not do
well in the London local elections in May, if it suffers from its
pro-Europeanism in the Euro elections next June, or if the next
parliamentary by-elections happen to be in seats where Labour would be the
obvious beneficiary of an anti-government protest vote, then the bright
lights of the political big time may recede and the pleasures of
responsibility fade.
In the language of growing up that has been a key theme this week: the
Liberal Democrats are old enough to drive, but you might still want to wait
a while before lending them your car.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Investment body set for tough rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANGE of chairman at the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed
self-regulatory body for retail financial services, reflects the
determination of the City's chief regulator, Mr Andrew Large, to prod the
industry into accepting tough new rules, industry officials said.
On Wednesday, Sir Gordon Downey, PIA chairman for the past nine months,
announced his resignation. Mr Large, chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, announced that Mr
Downey would be replaced by Mr Joe Palmer, a SIB board member and a former
stalwart of the life insurance industry.
'The PIA chairman's role is to sell the organisation,' said the chief
executive of one life company. 'And it is difficult to see how Sir Gordon
could do that. From the point of view of banks and building societies, which
the SIB wants to join the PIA, progress has been too slow.'
Mr Large, in a wide-ranging review of City regulation in April, said that
the PIA is central to his vision of how a two-tiered supervisory system can
genuinely offer better investor protection. Last December, Mr Large set out
a tough agenda for the PIA, telling Sir Gordon that he will not allow the
new body to come into existence unless it meets much higher standards than
those currently prevailing at the two existing self-regulatory organisations
for the industry.
But Sir Gordon - who, according to board members, has sought to rule by
consensus - has moved far too slowly to put Mr Large's agenda into place.
'We have made progress on detail but not on principle,' said one board
member. 'Most of the issues on principle remain outstanding.'
Yesterday, PIA board members said that Mr Palmer had been going to great
lengths to reassure them that in spite of his former role as chairman of
Legal and General, the life insurer, and as an ex-chairman of the
Association of British Insurers, he represented no industry in particular.
In a series of phone calls to board members, Mr Palmer said he was
relinquishing all his non-executive directorships connected with the
financial services industry, including board membership at the SIB. One
board member said Mr Palmer had told him he was not giving these up 'not to
be my own man'.
Several board members also said that they had had telephone conversations
with Mr Large reassuring them that Mr Palmer was independent of life
insurance interests. They added that the fact that Mr Large had reached into
his own board to find a replacement for Sir Gordon was a sign that he
expected him to put the SIB agenda into practice.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Delegates approve emergency
resolution condeming BR cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DELEGATES overwhelmingly approved an emergency resolution condemning the
recent cuts in services announced by British Rail, attributing them to
pressure exerted by the government as it prepared for rail privatisation.
The party leadership accepted the need for a properly funded rail network as
an essential part of the infrastructure of the regions, and for the
protection of the environment and the stimulation of the national economy.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Party rejects call to link
pensions with earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE LEADERSHIP'S policy on pensions was carried yesterday
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
with delegates responding to appeals for realism by rejecting a call for the
restoration of the link between earnings and the level of pensions.
An amendment by Mr Archy Kirkwood, the party's chief whip and spokesman on
social security, advocated the restoration of the link removed by the
Thatcher government.
Mr Kirkwood contended that in the present stage of the political cycle it
would be premature for the party to abandon its commitment to improving the
living standard of all pensioners. 'I do not want to release the earnings
linkage until I am absolutely convinced it is unaffordable,' he said. He
estimated that the initial net cost of the move would be Pounds 250m a year.
Mr Mike Bell, a member of the party's federal policy committee, insisted:
'We sniff the scent of real power and realise that these policies may have
to be implemented.'
He suggested that the real cost of restoring the link between pensions and
earnings would be Pounds 3bn a year. Mr Bell said it would 'rip the heart
out' of the recently published consultative document in which the party
outlined costed proposals for providing dignity in old age for all
pensioners.
Sir William Goodhart, chairman of the tax and benefits working group, agreed
that a forthcoming policy paper should include a commitment to establish a
separate 'pensioners index' which more accurately reflected their living
costs than the retail price index.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, seized on the fact that the
debate had shown Mr Kirkwood to be at odds with Earl Russell, Liberal
Democrat spokesman on social security in the House of Lords. The minister
said this had demonstrated the 'anarchic confusion' in Liberal Democrat
ranks.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Car output up but may fall again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR production last month jumped by 25.4 per cent to 66,653 compared with
August last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders announced
yesterday.
But the society warned that cuts announced recently would seriously depress
output in the final months of the year.
Car production in the first eight months of this year rose 8.1 per cent to
927,723 from 858,417 in the corresponding period a year ago. The rise is in
stark contrast to steep falls in the rest of western Europe.
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, president of the society, warned that car producers were
now being hit by the effects of 'the huge fall' in car registrations in
continental Europe. 'It now appears likely that, following a number of
production cutbacks, the British-based industry will this year produce no
more than it did in 1992,' he said.
The benefit of higher car sales was being countered by the fall in exports
to continental Europe, he said. At the same time, the continuing steep
decline in the production of commercial vehicles was 'a source of great
concern'.
Output of commercial vehicles in August at 5,428 was 56 per cent lower than
in the same month a year before, while production in the first eight months
of the year has fallen by 29.7 per cent year-on-year to 123,403.
The forecast of unchanged output for 1993 was a setback for the industry,
which had expected 'a considerable build-up of production' this year, said
Mr Whalen.
Car output in the first eight months of the year has been boosted by the
start-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their new plants in Burnaston,
near Derby and in Swindon, and by the rapid build-up of output by Nissan at
its Sunderland plant.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has given its support to the
Motorfair Show at Earl's Court in London, which has been organised every two
years since the SMMT's 'official' show moved to Birmingham's National
Exhibition Centre in 1978. There will now be an annual show alternating
between London and Birmingham.
This year's Motorfair, which has already been renamed the London Motor Show,
will take place at Earls Court between October 21 and 31.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Milk price auctions attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY industry executives yesterday attacked proposals put forward by Milk
Marque - successor to the Milk Marketing Board - for an auction to set
prices and allocate supplies when the industry enters a free market next
April.
They also questioned the legitimacy of the proposals because the government
has not yet approved the arrangements under which Milk Marque will operate.
'I'm not sure it's really an auction: it's not even-handed and it's not
transparent,' said Mr Jim McMichael Phillips, president of the Dairy Trade
Federation.
Industry executives object to the complexity of the scheme, which has five
stages for determining prices with plans to consult widely before final
prices are set.
'The fact that all these consultations are built into it leaves it open for
wheeling and dealing behind closed doors, and that is not the way a free
market should work,' said Mr Neil Davidson, group executive at Northern
Foods.
Northern Foods plans to buy all its milk directly from farmers when the
government's compulsory purchasing system is abolished next year.
MD Foods, a British offshoot of a large Danish farm group, has approached
farmers about buying supplies directly, but also plans to purchase some milk
through Milk Marque.
'I'm unhappy with the way milk will be allocated,' said Mr Roger Clarke, MD
Foods' commercial director. 'If there is too much demand for supply and
companies need to be scaled back, what basis will they use for that?'
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, said his proposals had
received tacit approval from the Office of Fair Trading. But Mr McMichael
Phillips said this was premature because the government had not yet approved
arrangements for Milk Marque to set itself up to replace the Milk Marketing
Board.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Incompetent trainees 'being let loose in the workplace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICAL contractors have warned that trainees are being 'let loose' in
the workplace although they are not competent to be employed as
electricians.
Mr Martin Pollard, chief executive of JIB, a joint council between employers
and unions in the electrical contracting industry, has written to Training
and Enterprise Councils warning them that not all are instructing to the
high levels of safety and skill required by the industry.
Mr Pollard said that some Tecs were funding two-year courses and releasing
trainees to find jobs as electricians although they had not reached the
required standards. He added: 'In fact the only position in which they could
be employed is that of a labourer - surely a waste of two years' training.'
Employer-led Tecs administer publicly funded training programmes, including
Youth Training, which is a main avenue for young people gaining vocational
qualifications.
According to the training arm of the industry, most responsible employers
would insist that their electrical employees were trained to an equivalent
of the new level three National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). A two-year
course, like the majority of those funded by Tecs, would generally only
offer a level two NVQ.
The UK is one of the few countries in the EC where there is no legislation
to ensure individuals are trained to a specific level before they can claim
to be an electrician.
A new training package for qualified electricians working in potentially
explosive situations, such as oil platforms, is currently being marketed. It
is likely that employers in sectors like the oil industry will increasingly
demand the qualification.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Seaside spiders sweat it out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POISONOUS purple spiders with 'an unpleasant bite' have spread along the
south and east coasts of England during recent abnormally warm weather,
according to a report from the Department of the Environment published
yesterday.
The inch-long spiders, which probably arrived in Britain concealed in fruit
boats, are now common in Portsmouth and Worthing and have been spotted in
Essex. Mr Rowley Snazell, zoologist at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology,
a government research agency, says their bite, which causes sweating, is
'fairly potent by British standards'.
Slugs, aphids, rats and pigeons also thrived in the mild winters and hot
summers between 1988 and 1990, causing considerable damage to crops, the
report finds.
In central England, the winter of 1988-89 was the warmest since 1659. The
study explores the effects on animals and plants that Britain could expect
if global warming occurs, although it says there is no evidence that the
warm weather was due to the emission of 'greenhouse gases'.
A vision of Britain with a Mediterranean climate emerges from the report's
150 pages of dense statistics. The grape and sunflower harvests in the south
of England flourished during the abnormally warm weather, and gardens
bloomed weeks early.
But agrochemical companies were the real winners. Sales of insecticides for
agriculture and horticulture rose by more than a third in 1989 to Pounds
39.4m, according to a British Agrochemicals Association survey.
To fight off the invasion of pests, farmers sprayed cereal crops an average
1.3 times, nearly double the rate in the previous year, according to Produce
Studies, the Newbury-based consultancy.
The period also saw severe storms, with two damaging gales early in 1990.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Export orders in manufacturing drop back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about the strength of the UK recovery have increased after a survey
by the Confederation of British Industry showed that export orders for
manufactured goods have slipped this month to their lowest level since
April.
The survey, published today, showed a contraction in overall order books
between August and September, although companies' optimism about their
ability to increase output rose for the ninth month in succession.
The CBI's soundings underline concerns that weak domestic demand and the
poor economic climate in key export markets may inhibit the gradual UK
upturn apparent in the past six months.
Inflationary pressures remain weak, according to the survey, with only 10
per cent of companies expecting to increase prices in the next few months.
The poll was conducted between August 27 and September 15. It covered 1,468
companies, accounting for about half of total manufacturing employment.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economics committee, said export order
books were 'substantially' below the levels of the early summer and the
recession in the rest of Europe was 'a major cause for concern'.
The fears about future levels of exports are particularly relevant to
recovery prospects because in the past year strong export growth has been
among the main influences pushing up overall UK output.
Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI economics director, said a cut in interest rates,
now 6 per cent, might be needed over the next few months to help boost UK
demand. In a speech in Manchester he said that the poor climate for exports
meant growth would remain 'hesitant' until next year's expected recovery in
demand in continental Europe.
Sixteen per cent of companies in the survey said export order books were
above normal, with 37 per cent saying they were below normal.
This gave a negative balance of 21 percentage points for this question,
compared with one of 15 points. In September last year the negative balance
was 33 points.
As for overall levels of orders, these were thought to be above normal by 17
per cent of companies with 38 per cent thinking they were below normal. The
negative balance for this question of 21 points was slightly below the
August level of 18 points, but a marked improvement on the negative balance
of 53 points 12 months ago.
Thirty per cent of companies said they thought they would increase output
over the next four months, and 13 per cent predicted this would go down. The
resulting positive balance of 17 points is the strongest since May and
compares with a negative balance for this question of 14 points last
September.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Defeated city counts its blessings: Government pledges
support if Manchester bids for Olympics Games in 2004
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL Manchester try again by bidding for the 2004 games?
'If the British Olympic Committee decide to opt for Manchester next time, I
will certainly be with them,' Mr Robert Key, the environment minister, said
last night.
'What the committee decides is up to them. All I can do is pledge the
British government's support in the future.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said last night that he would 'most
certainly' like to see a British bid for 2004.
Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on his return from speaking to the
International Olympic Committee in Monte Carlo, he said that it was for
Manchester to decide whether to make a third attempt. 'I can only say I
don't think they could have presented the bid better,' he added. 'They may
well wish to try again.'
Mr Craig Reedie, British Olympic Association chairman, said it was too soon
to decide whether or not to bid for the games in 2004.
'We have until March 1996 before any decision is taken and that gives us a
little time to think about it,' he said. If our national Olympic committee
is very keen to go again, we'll have to look at all applications.'
Meanwhile Mr Key joined in the general, sometimes tearful, disappointment at
Manchester Town Hall, where about 600 of north-west England's political,
business and community leaders had gathered to watch the events in Monte
Carlo.
In spite of the result, people were generally counting their blessings: a
new velodrome - Britain's first national cycling stadium - and an
international-class arena which is already sparking redevelopment around it
that should extend and enhance Manchester's city centre. The world cycling
championships will be held in the city in 1996.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, has put the benefit of the new
facilities, plus environmental improvements to go with them and the act of
bidding itself, at Pounds 200m of investment and 480 jobs. The government
has put up about Pounds 75m of the money.
Mr Key said the bid had developed a new means and spirit of co-operation
between central government and the private sector which was proving an
important spur to urban regeneration.
'We could not have done anything more to win,' Mr Key added, echoing a
widespread feeling among the bidding team that Manchester's bid was the best
Britain could do.
Their team yesterday included Mr Major, the Princess Royal, political and
business leaders and sporting stars.
Manchester was making its second bid for the Olympics, having knocked
Birmingham out of bidding for the 1996 Games and beaten London to carry the
flag in yesterday's race. It had a series of good selling points:
wholehearted government support; a guarantee by Mr Major that costs would be
met; an athlete's village within walking distance of most of the events;
Britain's position as a stable democracy; the country's best regional
transportation infrastructure of roads, railways and airport, and good
telecommunications.
Mr Scott's team persuaded 79 of the IOC's 91 members to visit Manchester -
more than went to any other bidding city.
After Atlanta won the race for 1996, Mr Sebastian Coe, a double Olympic gold
medallist runner and now a Tory MP, said only London had enough status and
prestige to win for Britain.
Last night Amec, the construction company leading the consortium to build
Manchester's Olympic stadium, said there was a groundswell of support for a
world-class stadium in the city.
'Although there is no commitment to fund a stadium now Manchester has lost
the bid, Amec will work hard . . . to bring forward construction proposals,
albeit a smaller version of the current design,' the company said.

FT  24 SEP 93 / South 'will lead recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHERN England, the west Midlands and Wales will enjoy the fastest growth
in Britain as the country emerges from the recession, according to a
regional economic forecast published today by the Northern Ireland Economic
Research Centre.
It says recovery in these areas will be fuelled by export growth and
increased investment rather than an upturn in consumer spending.
The centre predicts that the most dynamic regions will be East Anglia and
the south-west - areas which the centre regards as part of the south.
GDP in East Anglia is expected to have grown by 3.2 per cent between 1992
and 1994, and by 2.8 per cent in the south-west against a national average
of 2.3 per cent. Growth in Wales and the west Midlands is put at 2.4 per
cent.
GDP growth in London is put at just 1.5 per cent, although the financial
services sector is set to expand for the first time since the recession.
The south is forecast to see more employment, although most other areas are
likely to see an increase in joblessness.
Growth and job prospects in the east Midlands, the Yorkshire area and
Humberside will be handicapped by pit closures, the report adds. In the
north of England, growth has been been undermined by the decision of Nissan,
the Japanese car manufacturer, to cut output and by the redundancies at Swan
Hunter on Tyneside.
Scotland and Northern Ireland, meanwhile, are said to be vulnerable because
of their reliance on state employment which is likely to decline as part of
the squeeze on public spending. Looking to 2002, the report says the outlook
is more optimistic. National GDP is set to grow by 2.5 per cent, while job
creation is likely to increase by 0.5 per cent.
The authors say that the devaluation of sterling and lower interest rates
should provide the long-term stimulus to finally end the recession.

FT  24 SEP 93 / MTV set for three extra channels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTV EUROPE, the London-based pop music satellite television channel, is
planning a move to digital technology by the beginning of next year.
This means that MTV, which already reaches more than 55m homes and as many
as 120m viewers, will be able to broadcast four channels in place of the
present one.
Mr Bill Roedy, chief executive of MTV Europe, has not yet decided how the
extra capacity will be used. The main possibilities include an additional
MTV channel tailored to the European market or a music channel aimed at an
older audience than that of MTV.
MTV is already on four satellites across Europe. The digital service is
initially expected to be aimed at European cable television networks via the
Eutelsat satellite.
Digital technology converts the television signal to digital form and
compresses it by storing the constant factors of a picture frame, only
transmitting elements that change from one frame to the next.
As many as 10 channels can be squeezed in the space of one.
MTV is also planning to join the British Sky Broadcasting subscription
package of channels next year. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake in BSkyB.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Leading vineyard for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the UK's largest vineyards, responsible for a tenth of the country's
wine production, has been put up for sale at a price of about Pounds 1.5m.
Lamberhurst Vineyards, near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, is being sold by Mr
Kenneth McAlpine, a director of the Sir Robert McAlpine construction
company.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the estate agents, said that it was extremely rare
for one of the dozen large UK vineyards to come on the market. The UK has
about 450 vineyards, mainly in the south-east of England, of which about 200
are cultivated on a commercial basis.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley said it expected the vineyard to attract interest from
drinks companies, private individuals and overseas wine producers seeking
access to its distribution outlets. The sale has been advertised in New
Zealand, South Africa, Australia and the US.
Turnover is expected to rise from last year's Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 1.25m
this year, as the amount of English wine sold through supermarkets
increases.
The vineyard's best selling line is a blend of white wine that is sold at
just under Pounds 3 a bottle. The vineyard pioneered the production of
English brandy and fruit liqueurs and recently brought into production one
of the UK's few red wine varieties. It has won 42 wine awards.
The Lamberhurst vineyard is on 75 acres, with 42 acres cultivated with
vines. It produces 210,000 litres of wine a year. The winery has a tank
capacity of 630,000 litres and bonded storage for 500,000 bottles. Half the
vineyard's production capacity is taken up with grapes from other producers
which do not have their own processing and bottling facilities.
The vineyard was established in 1972 and came into full production in 1982.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Treasury signals further sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS 'significantly more scope' for privatisation or contracting out of
central government functions than had previously been envisaged, a Treasury
minister said yesterday.
In remarks which will raise expectations that there may be more government
sell-offs, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the
privatisation programme had been 'one of the clear successes of the last 14
years'.
Mr Dorrell, who was speaking to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy, said that departments must ask whether the in-house
provision of a service 'enhances or detracts from' core functions.
'When once government asked 'what shall we sell?' We now ask 'what must we
keep?'' he said.
Reporting on discussions he had held on future plans with departmental
ministers, Mr Dorrell said five questions had been asked about departmental
activities: can it be abolished?; can it be privatised?; can it be
contracted out?; can it be market-tested?; and can it be given agency
status?

FT  24 SEP 93 / National Power application to build new Didcot plant
approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday approved National Power's
application to build a 1,500MW gas-fired power station beside its existing
coal-fired plant (above) at Didcot in Oxfordshire, David Lascelles writes.
The approval brings to 25 the number of new gas-fired power stations
authorised by the Department of Trade and Industry. Their total capacity is
17,900MW, equivalent to about 25 per cent of total capacity in England and
Wales.
National Power welcomed the Didcot decision, and said it would now decide
whether to proceed with construction at that site or at Staythorpe in
Nottinghamshire, where it received permission to build a similar power
station last May. More than two years have passed since National Power first
placed its application.
Consent at Didcot is subject to 58 conditions covering issues raised at a
public inquiry early last year. National Power is also required to monitor
emissions and set up a local liaison committee and complaints procedure.
The rapid growth of gas has been blamed for causing the shrinkage of the
coal industry with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.
However the government has been keen to encourage the switch to gas because
of the fuel's cleaner environmental record.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Minister on defensive in Iraq probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTER with cabinet responsibility for open government yesterday
justified withholding information from parliament on defence policy towards
Iraq because it served the 'overriding public interest'.
However, Mr William Waldegrave also admitted to the Scott arms-for-Iraq
inquiry that information was held back from the media because it was
embarrassing and difficult to deal with.
The minister said that if it had been publicly announced that the government
had agreed to relax the strict export guidelines to Iraq it would have been
interpreted by Iran as 'a huge shift'. This would have endangered the lives
of British hostages.
While accepting that the 'correct impression had not been given to
parliament' about government decisions, he insisted on justifying the
official attitude taken while he served as Foreign Office minister between
July 1988 and November 1990.
'This was the cost one had to set against the other dangers I have talked
about . . . the overriding public interest was that you might be putting
British lives at risk,' Mr Waldegrave said.
Mr Waldegrave's dogged defence of the government's record came under
challenge from Lord Justice Scott and Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, the
inquiry's counsel, for the second consecutive day.
'Isn't it a healthy factor of a democratic society that this kind of subject
should be debated?' Lord Justice Scott asked.
Miss Baxendale put it to the minister that he was involved in a 'post-hoc
rationalisation' of policy that was not fully supported by the evidence.
Mr Waldegrave conceded that one of the reasons for withholding the changed
wording of the original guidelines was fear among ministers and officials of
generating domestic opposition to its policies.
The minister said he had approved a briefing note for officials talking to
the BBC which excluded any mention of the relaxed guidelines. The note was
issued prior to a Panorama programme on Britain's arms trade with Iraq which
was broadcast in September 1990, after the Iraq invasion of Kuwait.
'Was it because it was difficult, inconvenient, and embarrassing to deal
with (the revision to the guidelines)?' Miss Baxendale asked.
'Yes,' answered Mr Waldegrave. He added that to expand on government policy
on Iraq during the inquiry now was proving just 'as embarrassing' given what
he said was the negative attitude of the media.
He insisted that greater flexibility in exports to Iraq had arisen from a
change of wording, not a change of policy.
Mr Waldegrave said the government expected Mr John Goulden, the British
ambassador in Turkey, who had told the Commons trade and industry committee
that the guidelines had been changed, to 'correct' his evidence.
The minister was due to be questioned about his involvement in approving the
export of machine tools to Iraq by Matrix-Churchill but his evidence was
adjourned until mid-October because he is flying to Japan today on
government business.
The inquiry resumes its public hearings on October 4.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Tories accused of links to quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday accused the government of setting up a new corporate state
by transferring control over billions of pounds of public money to quangos
staffed by central government 'placepeople'.
Launching an analysis of appointees to 41 of these non-governmental public
bodies, the party highlighted the number who had links to companies that
donate money to the Conservative party.
The situation gave 'serious cause for concern', the party said. 'It amounts
to a new hegemony . . . in which the interests of the governing elite and
big-business inter-ests are seen to merge.'
Among the bodies singled out by yesterday's report was the Bank of England's
18-strong court of directors, six of whom were said to be associated with
corporate donors to the Tories.
Mr Gerry Malone, Conservative party deputy chairman, rebuffed the attack.
To suggest a link between public appointments and Tory donations was 'an
outrageous attack on people who offer their services to the public, often
for little reward', he said.

LEADERS of 900,000 council manual workers last night agreed a 1.5 per cent
pay deal in line with the government's ceiling this year on wage rises for
the public sector.
Union negotiators claimed a breakthrough with an agreement to pay give
part-time workers bank holiday pay from next July.
Most white-collar town hall workers - who have still to agree this year's
claim - are expected not to vote for industrial action against the pay
ceiling. The ballot of 500,000 local staff belonging to Unison, the public
services union, will close today. The results will be be made public on
Monday.
Meanwhile Fire Brigade Union leaders will meet local authority employers
today in what they describe as a 'last chance' to secure a wage rise in
November based on the 15-year-old pay formula.
Earnings drift in the public services contributed to a rise of 7.5 per cent
in the public-sector pay bill to Pounds 92bn in 1992, according to the
Public Finance Foundation.

FT  24 SEP 93 / LUI brokers diverted millions to Liechtenstein accounts: 'Mr
Fixit' refused to co-operate with DTI inspectors - Founder and director
acted with 'gross misconduct'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS of pounds in insurance premiums were wrongfully diverted to
Liechtenstein accounts by brokers at the former London United Investments,
according to a report by government inspectors published yesterday.
The report into the activities of LUI and CR Driver and Co, a connected but
privately owned underwriter, was by inspectors from the Department of Trade
and Industry. They concluded that at least three underwriters at the company
were intended to benefit from the transfers, which had no insurance function
whatsoever. Both companies are now in liquidation.
The underwriters concerned are Mr Charles Driver, founder and controlling
shareholder of CR Driver and chairman of LUI from 1982, Mr Henry Weavers,
the chief underwriter at HS Weavers, an underwriting firm that became a
subsidiary of LUI, and Mr Peter Wilson, a director of Driver and of LUI.
Between 1970 and 1989 about Pounds 40m, allowing for exchange rate
fluctuations, was diverted from Driver and Weavers to Liechtenstein and
German companies. Many of these were controlled by Mr Graham Smith, the
Liechtenstein-based underwriter at the heart of the DTI investigation.
The report says that Mr Driver, Mr Stanley Mayhew, a director of Driver, Mr
Weavers and Mr Wilson all dealt directly with Mr Smith.
Mr Smith used a series of Liechtenstein and German companies to transfer Mr
Weavers' reinsurance premiums through the bank account of a Liechtenstein
anstaldt, or type of trust, in Vaduz called PAA. Reinsurance is the way that
underwriters reduce exposure to potential losses by spreading the risk
throughout the markets.
Mr Smith, described in the report as a 'Mr Fixit', still lives in
Liechtenstein. He refused to co-operate with the DTI inspectors.
None of the Smith companies, said the report, carried out the essential
functions normally associated with the role of an insurance broker. 'It is
our view that the Smith companies were not genuine insurance or reinsurance
brokers,' the inspectors said.
They added: 'We can see no necessity or commercial reason for the use by
Driver and the LUI group of the Smith companies. We believe that all such
functions as the Smith companies performed could easily have been performed
either by Driver or the LUI Group.'
One of the first Liechtenstein companies used to receive money transfers -
variously described as commissions, brokerage, shared commissions and
administration fees - was Sarita. According to one witness, Sarita - set up
by Mr Smith and Mr Driver - was used in a project to sell US cancer
insurance policies in the UK and Argentina. This money has not been traced.
The inspectors discovered a private account held by Mr Driver in Bermuda,
which was also used by Mr Mayhew.
The inspectors said that Mr Mayhew and Mr Driver acted with 'gross
misconduct' in their use of the account.
Mr Smith must have known, concluded the inspectors, that he was performing
'no genuine commercial function for Driver and the LUI group'. Both he and
his wife, Isolde, they decided, were 'knowingly parties to the wrongful
diversion of funds' from Driver, LUI and the Weavers stamp companies.
'The overwhelming probability is that they derived some financial benefit
from those funds but we are unable to determine the extent,' said the
inspectors.
Mr Driver, a former underwriter at Alexander Howden, had 75 per cent of
Driver's shares. He formed Weavers with Mr Weavers, an underwriter, in 1963
and became a director of LUI when it took over Weavers in 1971. In 1982 he
became LUI's chairman. The inspectors said he was suffering poor health and
had difficulties in recollection. 'Nevertheless,' they said, 'we are driven
to the conclusion that on a number of essential issues he has not told us
the truth.'
The inspectors said that Mr Driver, a keen polo player, was clearly 'the
boss' of the LUI Group and inspired awe and trepidation in employees. 'In
our view it is inconceivable that the events chronicled in this report could
in general terms have occurred behind his back and without his knowledge or
approval,' the inspectors said.
Mr Weavers, who went to live in Bermuda, was too ill to be interviewed at
length by the inspectors and died this year.
Mr Peter Wilson, who eventually became managing director of Weavers, helped
conceal commission payments paid to Smith companies and Sarita, the report
said.
The board of LUI as a whole, excluding Mr Driver and Mr Wilson, are
exonerated from criticism by the report, which said the problem arose when
the business was facing a difficult future.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Complex case sparks conflicts of interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTIGATION by DTI inspec-tors is just one of many inquiries spurred
by one of the most complex corporate collapses to affect the world of
insolvency, Andrew Jack writes.
Accountants, lawyers and police have been working for up to three years on
transactions linking London United Investments, its insurance subsidiaries
and other connected businesses.
Potential liabilities from the five LUI insurance subsidiaries alone could
ultimately exceed Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn), and are already estimated at
about Dollars 5bn.
LUI entered administration in 1990 owing creditors Pounds 40m. HS Weavers,
an underwriting subsidiary of LUI, has since been wound up and CR Driver,
another underwriter founded by a director of LUI, is in liquidation.
Five LUI subsidiaries, Kingscroft, Walbrook, El Paso, Lime Street and Mutual
Reinsurance, known collectively as Kwelm, are now in provisional liquidation
under the control of accountants at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. A proposed scheme of
arrangement with creditors was announced earlier this month.
Pay-outs to creditors will largely depend on the final size of claims
against insurance policies issued by the companies before they collapsed.
Claims are likely to be received for many years to come.
Some money may be generated by litigation. Proceedings have begun against
the Graham Smith network of companies in Germany and Liechtenstein alleged
to have received money from Driver and Weavers, as well as against the
auditors and directors of LUI, and the auditors of Weavers.
Related freezing orders for up to SFr111m (Pounds 50.6m) have been brought
in connection with the money removed, and these are currently on appeal in
the Liechtenstein courts.
There are enormous potential conflicts of interest in the LUI insolvency,
because all the larger accountancy firms to which the insolvency
practitioners belong are also creditors as a result of claims on
professional indemnity policies they bought in the past from companies in
the group.
In its conclusions, the DTI report called for the inclusion in reinsurance
treaties of clauses dealing with commissions and detailing brokerage fees.
The report is not the first to consider the affairs of the group. Mr John
Dingell, a US congressman, published a report in 1990 which covered aspects
of the LUI affair as part of an investigation into the collapse of several
failed insurance companies in the US.

FT  24 SEP 93 / University chiefs split on funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMITTEE of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents 102
universities, yesterday failed to agree on a new funding system for higher
education which would make graduates pay towards the cost of their tuition.
Instead, the university leaders tried to increase pressure on the government
by saying that higher education must continue to expand and that a decision
on raising extra funds was 'inescapably a political one'.
The announcement followed the Labour party's postponement earlier this week
of a document on extra university funding and the refusal by Mr John Patten,
education secretary, to commit himself to a new source of funding. The
vice-chancellors suggested that nobody was prepared to take political
responsibility for making students pay.
Mr Patten yesterday claimed that Labour's 'entire credibility' over
education is at stake following its decision to delay publication of the
discussion document. The paper, which was already in the hands of university
vice-chancellors, was distributed to journalists by Mr Patten.
He said Labour was in 'chaos' over education and called on Mrs Ann Taylor,
shadow education secretary, to resign.
Speaking after the committee's annual meeting at Leicester University, Dr
Kenneth Edwards, the committee chairman, said: 'If the government is unable
to provide sufficient funds for further expansion of higher education, some
schemes involving a contribution by students once their earnings have
reached an adequate level seems inevitable.'
A report by the consultancy London Economics identified four options: a
graduate income tax, loans to cover flat-rate tuition fees, loans for living
costs, or 'top-up' fees varying between universities.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Loophole allows water companies to avoid tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TAX loophole has enabled the privatised water companies to make Pounds 7bn
in profits while paying hardly any mainstream corporation tax, Mr Gordon
Brown, shadow chancellor, will claim today.
This is one of a number of loopholes Mr Brown is expected to highlight at a
press conference this morning, which is billed as the government's 'double
whammy' on taxation, in a reference to the Tory advertising slogan attacking
Labour in the last general election campaign.
Mr Brown is expected to urge the Treasury to end the water companies'
concession on capital allowances, which he says is costing the taxpayer as
much as Pounds 1bn.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Ports 'boosted' by policy on labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S ports have grown more productive and competitive since the
government's abolition of the registered dock labour scheme four years ago,
says a report published yesterday by the Department of Employment.
But it adds that the adverse economic climate since 1989 had 'prevented
former scheme ports from realising all the benefits of abolition'.
It argues: 'Many predicted wider benefits of abolition have yet to be
fulfilled.
'But abolition has created the conditions for viable port-related
investment, and will enable other developments to take place as the economic
recovery continues'.
However, an increase in the number of reported accidents per employee is
reported in the ex-scheme ports, along with a decline in training.
Improved productivity has not led to a reduction in the prices to port users
but has increased the profit margins of port employers. While there has been
some port-related investment since abolition of the registered ports, this
has 'been limited by over-capacity in the industry' as well as the
recession.
The report adds that abolition has 'not yet had a significant impact upon
the level of non-port-related investment activity within the estates of the
ex-scheme ports'.
Lord Caithness, shipping minister, welcomed the study. 'Abolition has
brought the substantially improved productivity and quality of service we
predicted,' he said. The study was carried out by two independent
consultancies - Peida and MDS Transmodel.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Tories accused of links to quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday accused the government of setting up a new corporate state
by transferring control over billions of pounds of public money to quangos
staffed by central government 'placepeople'.
Launching an analysis of appointees to 41 of these non-governmental public
bodies, the party highlighted the number who had links to companies which
donate money to the Conservative party.
The situation gave 'serious cause for concern', the party said.
'It amounts to a new hegemony . . . in which the interests of the governing
elite and big business interests are seen to merge.'
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, said the analysis directed 'a penetrating
shaft of light into the murky world of Tory government today'.
He said: 'Having aggregated unprecedented central power in Whitehall, they
now impose their will through the new magistracy of ministerially appointed
quangos. The only qualification for membership is to be 'one of us'.'
Among the bodies singled out by yesterday's report was the Bank of England's
18-strong court of directors, six of whom were said to be associated with
corporate donors to the Tories.
Four directors of British Coal were said to have links to companies which
gave money to the Conservatives and the Centre for Policy Studies, the
right-of-centre think-tank.
Three members of the board of British Rail were said to have similar
connections to Tory party donors.
Mr George Howarth, the Labour MP who prepared the report, said it reflected
'the rot and decay in the British political system whereby this mentality of
'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' has permeated the very sinews
of government'.
Mr Gerry Malone, Conservative deputy chairman, rebuffed the attack. To
suggest a link between public appointments and Tory donations was 'an
outrageous attack on people who offer their services to the public, often
for little reward,' he said.

THE SCOTTISH National party yesterday backed away from launching a campaign

writes.
It followed a heated debate at its annual conference in Dunoon in which
several speakers argued that a campaign would be ineffective.
Mr Peter Macleod proposed a campaign based on the slogan 'pay the bill, not
the tax'. Scots would be urged to delete the VAT from their fuel bills when
the tax comes into force next year.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Power prices are 'low on EC scale'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK DOMESTIC electricity prices are at the lower end of the price range in
European Community countries, and industrial prices are in the middle, says
the Electricity Association, the power industry trade group.
The association's annual survey of international electricity costs put UK
domestic prices at 9.29p per kilowatt hour.
This compares with Belgium at the top of the range with 13p and Greece at
the bottom with 7.68p. Other countries with cheaper rates than the UK were
Ireland with 8.91p and the Netherlands with 8.28p.
UK industrial electricity prices were put in sixth place at 5.29p per kWh,
compared with Germany at 7.62p at the high end and Denmark with 4.21p at the
low end.
On a world scale, the UK was ranked 11th for domestic prices and eighth for
industrial. The most expensive country on the domestic scale was Belgium,
and on the industrial, Japan.
The prices are certain to be challenged by UK industry, which has argued
that British prices are much higher than in the large industrial economies
on the Continent.

FT  24 SEP 93 / KIO, BP and the Dollars 5bn shell game: How a ruse by Kuwait
may have cost the Inland Revenue over Pounds 600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERY few people in the City of London have ever heard of the late Trevor
Ball. Even fewer know that for a decade this east Londoner who left school
at 16 was one of the most powerful money managers in the world.
Officially Ball was the chief investment manager of Kuwait's international
investment arm. In reality looking after the Kuwait Investment Office's
mainstream investments - on behalf of the state fund, the Reserve for Future
Generations - was only a part of his responsibilities.
Until his sudden, premature death in 1991, he controlled Dollars 5bn on
behalf of a secret client, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, the emirate's
national oil company.
The KIO's investment activities are enormously discreet. But secrecy was
particularly important in the case of Ball's activities. He worked from a
cramped office on the fourth floor of St Vedast House, an anonymous City
block. From here he played a central role in an elaborate stock market ploy
during late 1987 and early 1988, in which the KPC, hiding behind the KIO,
bought a 21.7 per cent stake in British Petroleum, then the world's third
largest oil company. It was a ruse that may have cost the British taxpayer
at least Pounds 600m.
Failure to disclose the true ownership of a stake in a UK company is also an
offence under the Companies Act. So disclosure of KPC's role in purchasing
the BP stake is likely to embarrass both Britain and the oil-rich Gulf state
for whose freedom from Iraqi occupation British troops fought in 1991.
At the time of the Dollars 1.7bn BP share raid, Kuwaiti officials and
ministers insisted this was just the biggest of a series of substantial KIO
investments in blue-chip companies around the world. Kuwait also said the
KPC was not involved at all. Even so the move stirred up great political
controversy.
BP was concerned that a substantial shareholding was being acquired by the
investment arm of one of the world's biggest oil producing countries. The
raid was particularly embarrassing for the UK government, since it had only
been made possible by the flop of the stock market sale in October 1987 of
the government's 31.5 per cent shareholding in BP.
However, the fact that KPC was the real purchaser of the near 22 per cent
stake means that the position for the British oil company BP was even more
perilous than it believed.
A former high ranking Kuwaiti official has confirmed to the Financial Times
that the KPC was indeed the real purchaser. He has asked not to be named
because he is concerned about reprisals from the Kuwaiti government.
The former official says that Kuwait deceived the UK government, the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which investigated the investment, and BP
itself. His account has been corroborated by a past Kuwaiti minister and two
former KIO employees. This version of events is also supported by copies of
Swiss bank statements which show that the KIO manages KPC's funds, a fact
confirmed for the first time by Mr Rashaid Al-Badr, current president of the
KIO.
In what seems to be more than a coincidence, the KPC's annual report for the
year to June 30 1988 shows an increase in its holdings of marketable
securities of Dollars 1.7bn, which is precisely what the BP investment cost.
Another possible tell-tale sign of the true ownership of the shares is given
by a computer print out (made by Mr Ball in early 1990) of all the
securities owned throughout the world by the KIO. If BP was a normal
portfolio investment by the KIO it should appear on this list. It does not.
KPC ownership of the BP shares is disputed by one former Kuwaiti minister.
He admits KPC funds were used to make the purchases, but says that the KPC
gave the money to the KIO in return for a portfolio of 'money market
securities'. He insists that the KIO then made the BP investment, as
originally claimed, on behalf of the Reserve for Future Generations.
If this were the case, it is odd that income earned on the BP shares has
been deposited in the KPC account and even odder that, at the time of the
raid, BP shares already owned by the Reserve for Future Generations were
transferred to the KPC account.
Even the former minister cannot dispute that at the very least the KPC
facilitated the BP investment by providing funding for it, which contradicts
what British ministers and the MMC were told at the time.
This latest controversy over KIO activities comes on top of a bitter battle
between the KIO's new management and its predecessors. Legal actions have
been brought in Spain and the UK against Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al-Sabah -
the former KIO chairman and a distant cousin of the ruling Emir - and
against Mr Fouad Jaffar, its urbane former general manager. They are accused
of being part of a conspiracy to defraud the KIO through its lossmaking
Spanish operations.
The former KIO managers say, however, that the new Kuwaiti government is
deliberately choosing to ignore evidence that the missing funds were paid to
an assortment of governments all over the world during the Gulf crisis in
late 1990, to ensure their support for the war against Iraq.
Before the Spanish embarrassment, the KIO had an impressive record as
manager of the international investments of the Reserve for Future
Generations, set up to generate income for when Kuwait's vast oil reserves
are depleted.
Between 1981 and 1991, the KIO received Dollars 9.1bn of funds from the
reserve and remitted Dollars 45.2bn back to Kuwait - generated by a
combination of investment income and asset sales. War expenditure reduced
KIO assets to around Dollars 25bn at the end of 1991 and less today. At its
peak, in the late 1980s, it was more than Dollars 40bn.
The KIO has never paid taxes anywhere in the world. Because it manages the
Reserve for Future Generations it has benefited from the international
convention that sovereigns do not pay tax. In 1989, a particularly good
year, the KIO earned around Dollars 6bn in income and capital gains from its
main funds, on which it paid no tax.
Other well known beneficiaries of this sovereign immunity from tax are the
oil producing states of Brunei and Abu Dhabi, which have built up
substantial portfolios of securities and property in industrialised
countries. The justification for a country like the UK providing this tax
immunity is that vast amounts of capital are attracted to its markets, which
might otherwise go elsewhere. The price in terms of lost tax revenue -
running to billions of pounds in some years, according to tax experts - is
thought to be worth paying.
The KPC, however, is not a sovereign entity as far as the Inland Revenue is
concerned, even though it is ultimately controlled by the state of Kuwait.
It is a company - set up like any other by issuing shares - and is therefore
a separate legal entity.
The KPC's assets and investments belong to the KPC and revenue earned from
those assets should be liable for tax. But a former Kuwaiti official says
that KPC has improperly received tax immunity by hiding behind the KIO. As a
result, it may have made tax savings of around Dollars 150m a year,
excluding a Pounds 458m special BP tax credit but including the credit on
normal BP dividends.
The Inland Revenue, which is considering the new evidence on the ownership
of the BP shares, is in a very uncomfortable position. Before giving tax
immunity to the KIO on the BP investment, it received a written assurance
from the Kuwait government affirming that the shares were directly held by
the state through the KIO - and therefore not by the KPC.
'It is not easy to challenge a statement made by a sovereign,' commented a
UK official, 'especially one of our main allies in the Gulf.'
At the centre of this web of complicated stock market deals was Sheikh Ali
Al-Khalifa Al-Sabah. The KPC's investment in BP was his initiative,
according to a former Kuwait official. Sheikh Ali Khalifa, a man whose
impatience and sharp tongue has made many enemies, is a clever and mercurial
member of Kuwait's ruling Al-Sabah family. He spent most of the 1980s as oil
minister and chairman of the KPC. He refused to comment on the record for
this article.
The KPC generates huge amounts of cash. At the end of June 30 1991, it held
marketable securities worth Dollars 3.5bn and cash and bank deposits of
Dollars 5bn.
According to a former official, the KIO received a mandate to manage KPC's
cash and investments in the early 1980s. The KPC's funds were held at Swiss
private banks, including Lombard Odier, a highly reputed and discreet bank
in Geneva. A special KPC account, called the 'Number Two Account', was set
up.
Only a tiny number of individuals knew that the KPC was the beneficiary of
the Number Two Account, though there is a tell-tale clue on the statements
sent by Lombard Odier to the KIO.
A statement copy headed 'Number Two,' breaks down the investments in the
account into different categories according to currency. Each category is
designated by a code and each code contains the initials 'KP' for 'Kuwait
Petroleum'. The total balance shown in the statement, which is not dated, is
Dollars 1.27bn.
The Number Two Account was managed by Ball, who had spent most of his
working life with the KIO, making his way up from clerk to become the second
most powerful non-Kuwaiti at the organisation after Mr Bruce Dawson, the
deputy general manager, since retired.
Lombard Odier's statements were sent directly to Ball who was assisted by a
couple of clerks and a junior Kuwaiti fund manager. Ball's instructions came
from the KPC in Kuwait. For a short period, he set up a series of other
Swiss accounts to manage the funds of KPC subsidiaries. But this made the
job too onerous for him and his small clerical staff, so eventually all KPC
investments were combined into the Number Two Account.
Almost from the moment the KPC was founded in 1980, Sheikh Ali Khalifa
wanted to build it up to rival the western oil multinationals, such as Shell
and Exxon and BP. The opportunity to buy a significant BP shareholding was
presented in October 1987 by the flop of the stock market sale of the
British government's stake in BP and a simultaneous rights issue.
Around 2bn BP shares were left in the hands of underwriters facing losses of
several hundred million pounds - and many of them were desperate to sell.
The price of the shares on the stock market was hovering around 70p,
compared with the underwriting price of 120p. Said one former KIO employee:
'We thought it was crazy that something which only days before was thought
to be worth 120p could now be bought for 70p.'
The KIO had already acquired 13.2m BP shares as one of the underwriters of
the issue. Sheikh Ali Khalifa was in London at the time and was enthusiastic
about buying more BP shares. He told the KIO to acquire at least 10 per cent
of the company. 'He said: 'Use my funds.',' recalled a former Kuwaiti
official. What Sheikh Ali Khalifa meant, according to the official, is that
cash in the Number Two Account should be used for the operation. The KPC
eventually bought even the KIO's original holding.
When the KIO on behalf of the KPC went into the stock market as a buyer of
BP shares, it attracted a stampede of sellers. The most astonishing buying
spree took place on just four trading days between November 13 and November
18 when 441m shares were bought for around Pounds 350m.
According to a Kuwaiti official, the BP shares were divided between the
Number Two Account and a then dormant account originally used for a KPC
subsidiary, called the Number Four Account. However, to prevent any leak of
the ownership of the shares, statements for the Number Four Account, a copy
of which has been obtained by the FT, do not include the 'KP' initials on
the classifications.
There were widespread rumours that the KIO was buying, but only a handful of
individuals at the KIO and in Kuwait knew what was really going on. Not even
the Kuwait Investment Authority, to which the KIO reports, was aware of the
buying until long after it had started. A former Kuwaiti minister said: 'The
council of ministers (Kuwaiti cabinet) was not informed until it became a
political problem.'
On November 18, BP disclosed that the KIO had acquired just over 10 per cent
of its shares. BP was appalled. Its chairman, Sir Peter Walters, was
concerned that the Kuwaitis would use the shareholding to put pressure on BP
to do deals which would benefit KPC and Kuwait's oil interests, but would
not necessarily be in BP's interests.
The attitude of the British government was initially more ambivalent.
Following the share flop, it made a general offer to investors to buy back
shares in their partly paid form at a price of 70p. The Kuwaiti purchases
saved it from the embarrassment of buying back more than a few shares.
As the Kuwaiti stake moved towards 15 per cent, however, the then Mr Nigel
Lawson, chancellor of the exchequer, became increasingly uncomfortable about
the potential for Kuwait to influence BP. However, neither he nor Sir Peter
ever thought that the owner of the shares might be the KPC.
All through the winter and early spring, the KIO on behalf of the KPC,
continued to add to its shareholding. But Sheikh Ali Khalifa was becoming
increasingly isolated from his colleagues by his decision to continue buying
aggressively. Sir Dennis Walters, the former Conservative MP who is an
adviser to KIO, Mr Jaffar and Mr Jasem Al-Kherafi, the then finance
minister, all became increasingly unhappy as the size of the stake increased
towards 20 per cent.
Then from the end of December to the end of March, the British government
tried to secure undertakings from Sheikh Ali Khalifa that Kuwait would limit
the BP holding to less than 20 per cent and would not interfere in the
management of the company. But a voluntary agreement could not be reached -
and as if to rub salt into the wounds of the British government, Kuwait
continued to buy, till the shareholding reached 21.7 per cent for a cost of
Dollars 1.7bn.
The British government refused to let the matter drop. On May 3, the MMC was
asked to investigate whether the investment was in the public interest.
Its report, published in October 1988, says that the Kuwaitis told the MMC
that 'although BP operated in an industry in which Kuwait had substantial
interests, principally through KPC, the BP shareholding was not bought for
that reason'.
The Kuwaitis also told the MMC that the BP shareholding was 'purchased and
held by the KIO without any prompting or instruction of the government of
Kuwait'.
Though the MMC was misled about the real ownership, it might in fact have
come up with the same recommendations even if it had known the buyer was the
KPC. Its report concluded that the stake could be used to exert pressure on
BP to do deals beneficial to Kuwait's oil interests. The KIO was ordered to
reduce its holding to 9.9 per cent within a year.
The Kuwaitis were horrified. There followed an intense period of political
lobbying and Mr Jaffar went to the US to hawk the stake to any oil company
which might be interested in it. He persuaded Pennzoil, the US company, to
buy it - but inserted a clause into the agreement which said the contract
was void if within a fortnight the Kuwaitis found a purchaser prepared to
pay more.
There was indeed such a buyer in the wings - BP itself. For two months, BP
had been talking to the KIO about buying enough shares to reduce the KIO
holding to 9.9 per cent. In mid-December, Sheikh Ali Khalifa rang Sir Peter.
'My price is 305p,' he said. That was the price allowing for the payment of
the two further instalments due to the UK government on the shares it had
sold. At that price, the Kuwaitis would have made a small profit.
BP's tax department had, however, come up with a way of reducing the cost to
the company. It pointed out that when a company buys back its own shares,
the Inland Revenue usually treats the payment as though it was a dividend.
Dividends are paid after deduction of basic rate tax, which at the time was
25 per cent. But a non-tax payer such as the KIO can claim back the 25 per
cent.
BP tried to put pressure on the Treasury to ensure that this tax structure
for the deal would be agreed, because it meant that part of the cost for
buying back the shares would be carried by the government. But the Treasury
refused to put pressure on the Inland Revenue.
In the event, the Inland Revenue received a statement from the KIO that the
BP shares were held directly by the Kuwait state, a sovereign, and so it
confirmed that it would pay Kuwait a tax credit of 58p per share. In the
spring of 1989 the KIO, on behalf of the KPC, sold 790m BP shares, receiving
Pounds 1.95bn from BP and a further Pounds 458m from the Inland Revenue.
Without the sovereign immunity from tax, the deal would have been far less
attractive to Kuwait. Indeed, Kuwait continued to benefit from the sovereign
immunity in respect of the dividends it has received from BP on the
remaining stake of near 10 per cent. Tax credits on these dividends have
been worth an estimated Pounds 156m.
If the Inland Revenue were to conclude that the investment in BP was in fact
held by the KPC and did not deserve sovereign immunity, Kuwait would owe the
UK government more than Pounds 600m in tax on the BP investment alone.
But a UK public official says that the Inland Revenue cannot on its own
decide to re-examine whether tax should be paid by Kuwait in respect of its
BP adventure. 'We would be questioning the good faith of a very rich ally,'
he said.
In the end, the British government will have to judge whether it is worth
offending a very old friend for the prospect of perhaps reclaiming several
hundred million pounds.

IRAQ agreed yesterday to activate UN surveillance cameras at two missiles
sites, thereby clearing the way for a resumption of talks that could lead to
the lifting of an oil embargo, agencies report from the United Nations.
Iraq's ambassador, Mr Nizar Hamdoon, said Iraq had told the UN Special
Commission, in charge of dismantling Baghdad's dangerous weapons, that the
cameras could be activated at any time. He said his government had 'agreed
to activate the cameras as a sign of good will' and they could be turned on
any time the special commission wanted.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, commission chairman, had linked the activation of the cameras
to continuing arms talks with Iraq.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Keating to face budget that refuses to budge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL KEATING will probably return home from Monte Carlo in a blaze of
glory after securing the Olympics for Sydney. But even this is unlikely to
deflect the spotlight for long from a far more fundamental domestic issue -
the Australian budget.
Five weeks after it was unveiled, the Australian government's first
post-election finance bill still lacks sufficient support to pass the
Senate. The resulting economic uncertainty has contributed to a plunge in
the nation's currency.
The Australian dollar stands close to 65 US cents compared with more than 68
cents when the budget was announced on August 17, although an increasingly
bleak outlook for commodity prices also bears some responsibility.
The exchange rate might be lower still but for remarks on Tuesday by Mr
Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor. These suggested that the
authorities might have to consider an increase in interest rates to protect
the currency from large falls. 'To date, we have achieved our objectives
with intervention,' said Mr Fraser, 'but if necessary, we would also use
interest rates.'
The roots of the budget problem lie in the 1993 election campaign, which the
Labor party of Mr Keating, the prime minister, was not expected to win.
After the surprise victory, the government found itself committed to some
expensive promises on the expenditure side, but lacked much leeway over how
it could finance them. As a Price Waterhouse analysis noted: 'The real focus
of the 1993-4 budget is about the funding the promised tax cuts - cuts that
are to apply to businesses and certain lower-income earners.'
The solution chosen depended heavily on indirect taxation. Much of the
'pain' required to pay for the measures was to come from an immediate
increase of one percentage point in all wholesale sales tax rates; increased
taxes on wine, cider, tobacco, petrol - especially unleaded petrol - and
from a broadening of the fringe benefits tax net. This strategy, it was
admitted, would push up inflation; the 1993-4 rate was forecast at 3.5 per
cent (although the figure has since been the subject of some controversy),
compared with an average 1 per cent in 1992-3. The budget deficit,
meanwhile, was predicted to rise from ADollars 14.6bn to ADollars 16bn
(Pounds 6.2bn to Pounds 6.8bn).
In many respects, the budget measures were unsurprising. But they left the
government open to attack. Within days, the opposition - despite being two
votes short of a blocking position in the Senate - had decided to make a
fight of the issue. That left the balance of power with two minority
parties: the Australian Democrats, who have seven senators, and the Green
party, which has two. They duly joined the rout.
Embarrassingly, the government's own bedrock support, the Australian Council
of Trade Unions and the Federal Labor party caucus, decided that the
regressive nature of some proposed tax changes was unacceptable.
After some heated exchanges, the government yielded. To pacify the
Democrats, it increased a tax rebate for low-income earners, reversed a
decision to exclude eye tests from Medicare rebates and lowered the proposed
differential between leaded and unleaded petrol. To buy off the Labor
caucus, it modified a previous budget plan to include unrealised capital
gains in pension assets tests. To offset the effect of these concessions,
the government said it would delay the introduction of its tax cuts by two
weeks.
This largely placated the Democrats, although the increased wine tax
continues to be contentious. However, the two Green senators, both from
Western Australia, remained far more obdurate. Mr John Dawkins, the
treasurer, met the senators two weeks ago, but was left holding a long
shopping list of proposed budget changes - from a freeze on defence spending
to an increase in unemployment payments. He declined to budge, and a
stalemate ensued.
There, during the current parliamentary recess, matters stand. In theory, a
failure to pass the bill once parliament sits again next week could lead to
'double dissolution' - that is, the dissolving of both houses of parliament
and the calling of a new election. That has happened before, in 1974,
although Labor was re-elected.
In this case, none of the budget's opponents has seemed anxious to pursue
such a drastic course. Meanwhile, a good deal of political point-scoring has
also been under way. Opposition from the Labor caucus has been interpreted
as an attempt by members of the party to trim Mr Keating's sails. The prime
minister, after all, is often viewed as a rather remote figure, disinclined
to consult with the rank and file.
The budget's form as well as its content has been attacked. Unusually, the
government had packaged the finance proposals into one bill, in an attempt
to prevent its opponents from picking off specific measures. However, legal
opinion has suggested that this may be unconstitutional.
So, on Tuesday, Mr Dawkins ate more humble pie, and said that the package
would be redrafted into eight bills. This, he maintained, would 'preserve
the integrity of the budget and allow the government to achieve its
medium-term fiscal strategy'.
In an effort to ensure that the bills do not pass or fail selectively, Mr
Dawkins added that the government would not implement the tax cuts unless
the revenue bills were also approved. However, the opposition has made clear
its continued objection to certain revenue measures, the Greens still want
modifications, and the Democrats remain unhappy about the wine tax.
The strain on government members - especially Mr Dawkins - is clearly
telling. 'Whenever it becomes necessary for me to leave Fremantle (his home
town), get on a plane and come to Canberra, the prospect of political
retirement does well in my mind,' the treasurer confessed this week.
This incautious remark was duly whipped up into a resignation threat by the
Canberra press, although Mr Dawkins' office denied that the embattled
treasurer had meant anything of the kind.

THE OLYMPIC 2000 bid decision may have arrived at an uncomfortable 4.30am in
Sydney. But Australia's biggest city was never going to miss its chance to
party.
At Circular Quay on the city's central harbour, tens of thousands of people
gathered to watch the event relayed live from Monte Carlo on giant
television screens. For the most part, the crowd was young, beer-swilling,
and intent on a good time. 'Syd-ney, Syd-ney', it yelled obligingly, as
presenters urged chanting. The atmosphere lay somewhere between that of a
pop concert and a football game.
But when Sydney's victory was announced, the decibel count rose to deafening
levels, and the normally decorous city centre was transformed into a
swaying, horn-blaring fiesta. Celebrating Sydney-siders hugged each other at
random. Sky and harbour twinkled with the lights from helicopters and the
flotilla of boats. Fireworks erupted over the famous harbour-side Opera
House, its 'sails' decked out in the Olympic bid colours.
In many of the city's big hotels, where residents and celebrities were
enjoying special 'all-night' packages, the partying was only marginally more
restrained. Most hotel managers had laid on continuous bar facilities, and
some had staged special events. The prize for innovation could have gone to
the Inter-continental. The upmarket hotel devised a five-course dinner, with
each segment tuned to one of contending cities - Turkish delight, Beijing
duck, a German fish-based starter accompanied by schnapps, and a
Sydney-style dessert concoction decked out in Olympic colours.
Manchester proved more of a challenge. In a leap of gastronomic imagination,
the chefs finally settled on barley soup and lamb sausage . . . served under
an umbrella.
The celebrations will now continue throughout today and well into the
weekend. This morning, the action switches from Circular Quay to
neighbouring Darling Harbour, where there will be more fireworks, bands,
concerts, and a variety of street theatre events. Pubs across the city are
expected open round the clock.
Ahead of the decision, many organisers had admitted that the task of
balancing their desire to cash in on a win, with the threat of small
turnouts if Sydney lost, was little short of a nightmare. The celebration
was called merely 'Thank You, Sydney' and one West Sydney pub hedged its
bets: its Friday programme was called 'Cheers and Tears'. In the event, they
need not have worried.
Meanwhile, Sydney's win was expected to give share prices a lift when
trading opened this morning. A cost-benefit study, undertaken by KPMG Peat
Marwick for the city's bid presenters has suggested that the nation could
enjoy a ADollars 7.3bn boost to gross domestic product over the next 11
years as a result of hosting the Games. Additional tax revenues, resulting
from extra tourists and expenditure, could amount to almost ADollars 2bn.
Local property and construction companies have been tipped to do
particularly well as a flood of building work gets under way.
For small traders, hawking Sydney souvenirs, the Games decision has been
every bit as nerve-racking. 'If Sydney loses, I'm going home to cry and get
some sleep,' said one T-shirt seller on Circular Quay yesterday afternoon.
Beside her was a pile of unsold sweatshirts. In the event, she may lack
sleep, but the dollars will certainly roll in.
The celebratory atmosphere, however, does mask some mixed views among the
city's residents about the desirability of hosting the Olympics. Most have
been enthusiastic - 'It could be as good as the America's Cup', said one
resident, ahead of last night's decision - and a recent poll suggested that
82 per cent of people in New South Wales favoured hosting the games.
But a minority of Sydney-siders have worried that estimates of a small
operating profit from the Games may prove over-optimistic, pointing to
financial problems which have developed in other Olympic cities. 'No thanx'
read the graffiti scrawled over one 'Thank You, Sydney' poster in the city
centre. The wails of the Cassandras, however, were inaudible amid the
'Syd-ney, Syd-ney' chants last night.

ISRAEL'S historic peace agreement with Palestinians was solidly endorsed by
the Knesset (parliament) yesterday, allowing the process to continue without
a referendum or early elections on the accord.
The vote of 61 to 50, with eight abstentions and one absent, was a good
result for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, and will take momentum away
from the right-wing campaign to scuttle the peace process.
Among the eight abstentions were three members of the right-wing Likud
party, exposing divisions within the opposition over the Israeli-Palestinian
peace deal.
Mr Meir Sheetrit, one of the three Likud abstainers, said after the vote
that a further seven parliamentarians from his party would also have
abstained if Likud had not imposed party discipline but allowed a free vote.
'A gap of 11 members of the Knesset between the supporters and the opponents
gives the government the freedom of action to implement (the agreement),' Mr
Rabin said.
Under yesterday's vote the Knesset formally approved three separate
agreements: recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the peace
accord with Palestinians providing for self-government and Israeli military
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, and an agenda for peace negotiations with
Jordan.
The ultra-orthodox Shas party, one of Mr Rabin's coalition partners which
broadly supports the peace process, also abstained after failing to win
support for a referendum.
Mr Arye Deri, leader of Shas and a former interior minister, said in the
debate that although there were many 'worrying points' about the agreement
regarding the security of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, the
accord remained the key to peace with Arabs. 'It is impossible to vote
against a chance. . . to reduce the possibility of war, the threat of war
against Israel,' he said.
Winding up the debate, Mr Shimon Peres, facing regular outbursts of heckling
from right-wing opponents, said: 'We can buy a ticket. . . to the dark and
gloomy 19th century, to the middle ages of fundamentalism, or to the 21st
century. The 20th century is over. Either backward or forward.'
The right-wing opposition, led by Likud and backed by tens of thousands of
demonstrators outside the Knesset, vowed to continue the campaign against
the peace agreement.
Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud leader, said the opposition would continue to
press the government to call elections before deciding more sensitive issues
such as the status of Jerusalem, a Palestinian state, and the right of
return of Palestinian refugees.

SOUTH AFRICA yesterday took a further historic step to end exclusive white
rule when parliament passed a bill to establish a multiracial Transitional
Executive Council, a move which will trigger the lifting of all remaining
non-military sanctions.
Passage of the bill marks the symbolic end of white hegemony and economic
isolation. The transitional executive, which will bring blacks a share of
power for the first time, will boost black morale, while the removal of 30
years of economic sanctions will help the morale of most whites.
However, right-wing whites have vowed to fight the transitional executive.
Members of the ultra-right Conservative party walked out of the chamber
yesterday after President F W de Klerk's ruling National party passed the
bill by 211 votes to 36 in a parliament which excludes blacks.
Parliament's assent followed an accord two weeks ago at the multi-party
constitutional negotiating forum. The African National Congress had,
however, said the passage of the bill through parliament was a condition for
the lifting of non-military sanctions.
Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president, is expected to call for the removal of
remaining sanctions - apart from the international arms em-bargo - when he
addresses the UN today in New York.
Passage of the transitional executive bill should permit Pretoria to
re-establish normal relations with the International Monetary Fund, which is
likely to provide some Dollars 800m (Pounds 526m) from its compensatory and
contingency financing facility to compensate South Africa for losses
incurred as a result of drought in 1992. Good relations with the IMF will
improve South Africa's ability to borrow commercially overseas.
The council, which will include one member from each of the 20-odd parties
negotiating a new constitution, will take office only after agreement has
been reached on a new constitution - a process which could take months.

DISTRESS was evident in the face of the Beijing studio audience watching the
nationally televised broadcast when the news came that Beijing had lost the
Games.
One member of the audience, when asked about the Americans, said simply: 'I
hate them.'
'It will not help relations with the US,' a western diplomat said. 'There
could be a surge of negativity.' The decision of the International Olympic
Committee is a big setback to the Communist party, which has acted for
months as if winning the Olympics was a foregone conclusion and has been
angered by calls in the US Congress for Beijing to be denied the 2000 Games
on human rights grounds.
Security was stepped up outside the British and American embassies, and
employees at the British embassy were told not to drive their cars to work
today for fear of vandalism.
Immediately after the decision, the state television announcer read a
prepared People's Daily editorial and a statement from Mr Li Tieying, the
head of the commission on restructuring economy. Both thanked the Chinese
for their efforts and stressed the importance of carrying on with China's
programme of reform and modernisation despite the defeat.
Meanwhile, stunned silence, a sad collective groan and the tears of several
of north-west England's lady mayoresses at a VIP recpetion greeted Sydney's
victory as the result came over a giant television screen in Manchester town
hall. But the red, white and blue balloons slung in nets high in the ceiling
of the great hall were not spilled out in celebration on to the throng
below.
Then, himself fighting back tears, Councillor William Risby, the lord mayor,
said: 'The task I have to do on behalf of Manchester, and its people, to a
man and a woman, is to wish all the best to Sydney for a successful games.'
Mr Robert Key, the environment minister who has provided the government's
chief liaison with the bid, said: 'Of course we are disappointed, but at
least we have kept it in the family. The British taught the world how to be
good sportsmen and sportswomen, so we mean it when we wish Sydney well.'
Anti-Olympic campaigners in Berlin did not crack open the champagne, nor did
they burst out in song last night. Instead, like the many thousands who had
gathered under the Brandenburg Gate, formerly the symbol of a divided
Europe, they joined in the stunned silence when the announcement was
broadcast on the giant screen.
Then the crying started, especially among the Berliners. Mr Herbert Werner,
a 40-year-old restaurant manager, was weeping with disappointment. 'It's so
sad,' he said. 'This would have been a great chance uniting not only the two
Germanys but Europe as well. We could have used the games as a symbol of
peace.'
Opposition to the campaign among some Berliners under the banner 'NOlympics'
helped influence the decision. The campaign distanced itself from anarchists
who staged arson attacks on department stores which had sponsored the Games
bid.
Jutta, from Kreuzberg, home of bedraggled leftovers of the 1960s radical
movement, said: 'I'm glad Berlin didn't get it. This unification is costing
a packet. We have too many problems with the economy and unification. The
taxpayer would have had to pay more.'
Such was Istanbul's assessment of its own chances that Young and Rubicam,
the marketing agency handling its bid to host the Games, even had a
'let-down' campaign in place before the disappointment of last night's vote.
But on a balmy Sep-tember evening, most young Istanbullus were more taken up
by the presence of Michael Jackson, the US pop star, rocking an enthusiastic
crowd of 20,000 at the Inonu Stadium overlooking the Bosporus when the IOC
announced the winner.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Reform 'failing' in African states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC reform is failing in sub-Saharan Africa and its crisis will deepen
unless finance ministers at the IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington help
resolve the region's 'crushing' external debt burden, officials of Oxfam,
the international aid agency, warned yesterday.
'After a decade of structural adjustment programmes implemented under the
tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF, Africa remains trapped in a downward
spiral of economic and social decline and poverty is increasing,' the agency
said in London.
'There is now overwhelming evidence that existing adjustment policies have
failed in two ways,' it said. 'They have not created a platform for
sustainable recovery and have not addressed the central challenge, correctly
identified by the World Bank, of alleviating poverty.'
However, the Bank's policies 'suffer from inappropriate design, inadequate
funding and poor implementation', the statement continues. Some of the
sharpest criticism is reserved for the IMF, whose role in Africa should be
reviewed by an international committee reporting to the United Nations,
Oxfam said.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, strongly defended its role in
Africa against Oxfam's charges, while admitting that the situation in Africa
was 'a matter of immense concern'.
But he said there were countries in Africa that were growing - ones that had
followed IMF economic reform programmes that had allowed increased output
and exports. Countries such as Mozambique, Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia were
all benefiting from IMF-inspired policies.
More could be done, he added. There was scope for greater regional
integration in Africa. Those countries which had not embarked on structural
adjustment programmes must put their macro-economic policies in order.
Mr Camdessus said there was much that industrialised countries could do to
improve the situation. Africa would benefit most from early conclusion of
the Uruguay Round.
Oxfam says the speed at which IMF programmes require governments to reduce
budget deficits is 'totally unrealistic and destructive'. The statement
calls for longer time frames and 'more selective introduction of trade
liberalisation measures.'
Debt servicing takes up a quarter of the region's exports, although only
half of scheduled payments are being met. Arrears currently exceed Dollars
11bn and are building up at an alarming rate.
Oxfam called on the IMF to create a special fund to write off part of
Africa's debt through the sale of gold stocks.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Sudan's civil war dispirits aid agencies: 'The outside world
is feeding this war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS SUDAN'S bitter civil war enters its tenth year, the United Nations and
western relief agencies are spending Dollars 200m (Pounds 132m) to feed and
shelter hundreds of thousands of families displaced by the conflict.
The international effort to ward off starvation in southern Sudan is both
larger and more costly than the media-lit operation in Somalia last year.
Operation Lifeline Sudan, the UN group co-ordinating relief efforts,
estimates 1m people cannot feed themselves. The war has robbed them of their
homes, their land and their cattle. There is no trade because the cash
economy has collapsed.
The UN's attempts to secure 'corridors of tranquility' for the passage of
food convoys have been shortlived. So UN cargo aircraft drop as much as
1,500 tonnes of food a week over an area three times the size of Britain. In
some areas, relief workers are flown in and out on a daily basis because
their safety cannot be assured overnight.
This kind of relief operation does not come cheap. Conservative estimates
put the cost at Dollars 4m a week. And although non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) report that the immediate threat of starvation has been
averted, many relief workers have begun to question the expense of a
humanitarian gesture which can only alleviate the symptoms of the Sudanese
malaise. The cure can only come with the end of the war.
Mr Marcus Oxley, of the Irish charity Concern, says NGOs are now faced with
the impossibility of planning any long-term development work because of the
conflict. 'Dealing with the famine emergency was the easy bit. But what can
we do now? NGOs do not have the power to solve Sudan's political and
military conflicts.'
Some relief workers, frustrated by the endless displacement of southern
communities and the swelling refugee camps in Uganda and Kenya, believe the
humanitarian effort has been misguided.
'The outside world is feeding this war,' says Mr Philip Winter of Save the
Children Fund. 'It is impossible to prevent combatants getting hold of food
relief. Government troops eat it. The southern rebels eat it. And nobody
wants to make a fuss about it.'
Dispirited UN officials say they have no option but to work through
whichever military faction controls areas targeted for relief.
They cannot quantify how much food is syphoned off to feed the fighters. And
they see no hope of an immediate ceasefire.
The Khartoum government, led by General Omar al-Bashir, has recaptured
several towns in southern Sudan since the Southern People's Liberation Army
split into two rival factions in 1991.
But for most of this year the Moslem Arab north has done little more than
watch its black and predominantly Christian southern countrymen massacre
each other in the struggle for hegemony over the rebel movement.
'Most of the hunger and displacement this year has been caused by fighting
among the rebel SPLA factions,' says Ms Sally Burnheim of Operation Lifeline
Sudan.
Unlike the faltering UN operation in Somalia, the UN humanitarian mission in
Sudan has no mandate to broker a peace accord. One ceasefire mediated by the
US this year collapsed almost as soon as it was signed. Four attempts to
bring the rival SPLA factions together have failed.
It is unlikely Washington will be able to play a further peacemaking role,
after accusing Khartoum of harbouring terrorist groups.
But if US concern with Islamic fundamentalism grows, southern Sudan could
become a flashpoint in the struggle to contain its spread.
Already, President Yoweri Museveni's government in Uganda is believed
tacitly to be supporting Mr Garang's SPLA faction.
Mr Garang's guerrillas form a convenient buffer between Islamic
fundamentalist militias sitting in the Khartoum-controlled garrison towns of
southern Sudan and Uganda's northern provinces.
Mr Garang accuses his rival, Mr Machar, of accepting military supplies from
the government in Khartoum.
Mr Machar denies he is supping with the devil. Washington suspects Khartoum
is being supplied by Iran and China, which is denied by the parties
involved.
'The international community appears to have run out of ideas to solve
Sudan's intractable conflict,' says Mr Winter. He believes western donors
would make better use of their money if they employed it to find an end to
the war.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EACH MORNING young unemployed Palestinians gather outside the
Jordanian-based Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) headquarters in Amman hoping
to join the ranks of policemen who will be charged with keeping the peace in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.
High up on the desert hills outside Amman their successful compatriots are
already being trained in riot control, anti-terrorist measures, forensic
science and crime investigation at Jordan's Police Academy. Twenty of them
yesterday carried out a mock crowd control exercise armed with shields,
helmets and batons. Dressed in dark blue uniforms, with the PLA insignia of
an eagle wrapped in the Palestinian flag stitched to their berets, they
stripped down their M-16 rifles and explained what their role in a
Palestinian entity might be.
'We will be there to follow the duties of any policeman - to protect our
people from everyone and everything,' says Captain Faisal Mahmoud Mustapha
who hails from Nablus on the West Bank. 'We want to protect both Jews and
Palestinians,' he adds.
Captain Mustapha along with another 400 policemen began their training this
month and expect to be deployed in Jericho by October.
A superior from the PLA, Brigadier Mohammad Qudsyeh, brushes off suggestions
that the police force may be pitted against extremist Palestinian groups
trying to wreck Mr Yassir Arafat's peace accord. 'I'm astonished that you
think we will start killing. We will quell our opponents through dialogue,'
he argues.
Soldiers from the estimated 12,000 strong PLA which is scattered throughout
the Arab world are due to be moved to training camps in Jordan and Egypt by
the end of the year before deployment to Gaza and Jericho. Until recently,
they were taught to use rifles against the 'Zionist entity' but most will
now be retrained as peacekeeping policemen.
Meanwhile a recruitment drive has begun in the occupied territories with
newspaper advertisements inviting both male and female applicants aged
between 18 and 35 to apply for the Palestinian force. Mr Faisal Husseini,
who heads the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks, says
the police force will eventually number 30,000.

FT  24 SEP 93 / SA approves transitional executive
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA yesterday took a further historic step to end exclusive white
rule when parliament passed a bill to establish a multiracial Transitional
Executive Council, a move which will trigger the lifting of all remaining
non-military sanctions.
Passage of the bill marks the symbolic end of white hegemony and economic
isolation. The transitional executive, which will bring blacks a share of
power for the first time, will boost black morale, while the removal of 30
years of economic sanctions will help the morale of most whites.
However, right-wing whites have vowed to fight the transitional executive.
Members of the ultra-right Conservative party walked out of the chamber
yesterday after President F W de Klerk's ruling National party passed the
bill by 211 votes to 36 in a parliament which excludes blacks.
Parliament's assent followed an accord two weeks ago at the multi-party
constitutional negotiating forum. The African National Congress had,
however, said the passage of the bill through parliament was a condition for
the lifting of non-military sanctions.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, is expected to call for the removal of
remaining sanctions - apart from the international arms embargo - when he
addresses the UN today in New York.
Lifting remaining sanctions is likely to have little practical impact, as
foreign investment is severely constrained by political violence which has
left 10,000 people dead since political reform began in 1990.
However, passage of the transitional executive bill should permit Pretoria
to re-establish normal relations with the International Monetary Fund, which
is likely to provide some Dollars 800m (Pounds 526m) from its compensatory
and contingency financing facility to compensate South Africa for losses
incurred as a result of severe drought in 1992. Good relations with the IMF
will also improve South Africa's ability to borrow commercially overseas.
The council, which will include one member from each of the 20-odd parties
negotiating a new constitution, will take office only after agreement has
been reached on a new constitution - a process which could still take some
months.
Although Mr Roelf Meyer, constitutional development minister, said the TEC
executive could be in place by next month, installation in November or even
December seems more likely.
The TEC could provoke a further upsurge in violence, with the Conservative
party and the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi vowing to
oppose it.
The council will have legally binding powers to act, but only in areas
directly affecting the coming multiracial elections planned for April 27
next year.

FT  24 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan warned on trade sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TRADE negotiators this week warned Japan that 'radical action' must be
taken to improve the current bilateral trade imbalance. If not, the economic
relationship between the two will be 'irrevocably harmed.'
The US trade deficit with Japan stands at some Dollars 60bn so far this
year, compared with Dollars 50bn for all of last year.
Senior US administration officials are in Hawaii, where the two sides have
begun to map out the details of the 'framework agreement' reached at the
Tokyo economic summit in July.
However, the only substantive news from the meetings this week was the
release of the figures for market share held by foreign semiconductors in
Japan, which fell in the second quarter from 19.6 to 19.2 per cent - the
second one-quarter drop in a row.
The US-Japan semiconductor agreement calls for a slow, steady increase in
market share, which hit 20.2 per cent in the last quarter of 1992, and US
trade officials insist that the average share this year be no less than 20
per cent.
A senior US official characterised the Japanese response to US proposals as
'moderately receptive' but said that could change. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
Japanese prime minister, is to meet President Bill Clinton at the UN in New
York next week.
'It is conceivable that instruction has gone out to not make waves,' the
official said. 'But we made it clear that our resolve stems from the White
House, (from) public reaction to the economic imbalance in this relationship
and the view that Japan's trade policies are a drag on global growth.'
Under the framework agreement, the Clinton administration embarked on the
latest US attempt to avoid retaliatory trade clashes with Japan, while
insisting that sanctions would follow unless there were immediate progress.

FT  24 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Tracking profits to the south - Canadian
railways branching into new markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION Canadian Pacific, and Canadians and foreigners alike are apt to
conjure up an image of a coast-to-coast railway snaking through the Rocky
Mountains and striking out across the prairies.
That image is rapidly being overtaken by a less romantic reality. Canada's
two railway companies, Canadian Pacific and the government-owned Canadian
National, are paying less attention to the thinly populated Rockies and
prairies, in favour of more profitable business to the south in the US and
Mexico.
'With globalisation and free trade, we're seeing the business opportunities
being much more north-south traffic flows within the continent, as opposed
to east-west,' says Mr John Guppy, CN's senior vice-president for marketing.
CN recognised the trend last year by combining its Canadian and US
operations under a single corporate umbrella, known as CN North America.
The Canadian railways' growing north-south focus is a response to the
emergence of an integrated North American market as customs duties are
eliminated and other trade barriers fall under the 1989 US-Canada free trade
pact. Rail traffic between Canada and Mexico, though still small, is also
growing rapidly as business seeks to capitalise on the North American free
trade agreement, due to take effect on January 1.
The southbound expansion by the Canadian railways is also explained by
rising competition from US railways and road transport. US west coast ports
and transport companies have already garnered more than two-thirds of the
container traffic from the Far East to Toronto and Montreal.
Mr Gil Mackie, CP's executive vice-president, says the Canadians suffer from
a lack of traffic density, which is where US railways have an important
advantage through their cost structures. He adds: 'If we're going to get the
level of efficiency we need, we need to expand our businesses.'
The top priority for both CP and CN has been to secure their access from
eastern and western Canada to Chicago, the hub of surface transport in North
America. CN cemented a western link last year by allying with Burlington
Northern, the aggressive US railway company which runs a line from CN's
railhead at Duluth, on the western tip of Lake Superior, to Chicago. Under
the agreement, CN can run its own trains on BN's track, with only a crew
change at Duluth.
In the east, CN's trump card is a proposed CDollars 200m (Pounds 99m)
cross-border tunnel between the US and Canada, under the St Clair River
north of Detroit. The tunnel, due to be opened late next year, is to
accommodate the double-stack container trains which have become one of the
railways' most potent weapons in their drive to bring down costs. The tunnel
is expected to lop 12 hours off the train-and-barge journey from Toronto to
Chicago.
CP has taken a slightly different approach. Besides numerous alliances with
US carriers, it has bought two US railways: the Soo Line in the mid-west and
the Delaware and Hudson in the north-east.
These acquisitions have helped to propel CP into the domestic US market. Mr
Mackie says that aspect was an afterthought, but 'the more experience we
get, the more we understand it and recognise the potential. I think we'll
see more and more of our operations within the US.'
The opportunities in a wider North American market are matched, however, by
the threat from powerful, low-cost US railroads and road transporters within
Canada.
Under the 1987 National Transportation Act, Canadian shippers can ask a
government agency to impose a freight rate for a carrier competing with CP
or CN. The Canadian railway is left to haul the goods to the nearest
connecting point with the US carrier - just the type of short-haul business
which CP and CN are trying to leave.
The Canadian carriers are working on three fronts to overcome their
handicaps.
First, they are lobbying governments in Canada and the US to drop rules
which put them at a disadvantage against their cross-border rivals. Canada's
high taxes on locomotive fuel and property are one sore point.
CN and CP estimate that their tax bill is the equivalent of about Dollars
200m a year higher than it would be if they were based in the US.
Furthermore, US railways can write off their investments almost twice as
quickly.
Second, the Canadian companies are pulling out the stops to bring down
costs. Their efforts range from the closure of loss-making lines in Canada
to greater emphasis on double-stack container trains. One short line has
already been bought by a US company, Railtex, which specialises in restoring
this type of operation to profitability.
Third, CN and CP are building their North American business on the old adage
that, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Beside their alliances with US
railways - such as Burlington Northern, Conrail and CSX - the Canadian
companies are forging links with road rivals on both sides of the border.
These alliances reflect the explosive growth in the past three years of
'inter-modal' shipments, involving the use of both road and rail. The goal
is for railways to focus on profitable, long-distance routes while trucks
act as short-haul feeders.
CN and CP are banking heavily on their 'piggy-back' trains, which carry
trailers equipped with both truck tyres and train wheels. According to Mr
Mackie, CP's piggy-back traffic has reached a new record every month this
year.

FT  24 SEP 93 / World Trade News: France tones down strident farm threats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government is temporarily toning down the stridency of its
campaign against the Blair House agreement in the interest of enabling the
European Commission's chief negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, to conduct his
'discreet' bid to revise farm trade terms with the US.
'We are now trying to cool things down,' said a senior government official
yesterday. Referring to recent French veto threats over agriculture and
broadcasting, he said: 'You won't hear any more declarations of this kind',
at least not until Sir Leon makes a progress report to European Community
ministers on October 4.
A sign of this calmer tone came yesterday in reaction to the complaint by Mr
Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, that France was pursuing an
'egotistical' trade policy. Mr Jean Puech, France's agriculture minister,
replied that such 'trumpeting would not advance the Gatt negotiations'.
Having himself deliberately raised the temperature of the Gatt farm
negotiations - in order to push his EC partners into their September 20
decision to reopen farm trade discussions with Washington - Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur has now decreed a return in Paris to calmer diplomacy. This
is partly tactical, in deference to Sir Leon Brittan's prediction, stated in
yesterday's Les Echos, that only 'very discreet' pressure on the
transatlantic farm trade issue will work with a US administration which is
pre-occupied with getting the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) deal
through Congress.
But Mr Balladur is also, at last, trying to prepare his farmers for
concessions. 'If others make concessions to us, we will make concessions
ourselves. One cannot win 100 per cent, but I have no intention of losing
100 per cent,' he said. Even that anodyne statement brought complaints from
worried MPs of his Gaullist party.
'We are trying to calm down the farm organisations, who only a few weeks or
months ago would erupt at the mention of Gatt,' an official said yesterday.
'Now with a reasonable position (on re-discussing the Blair House deal on
farm trade), and with EC solidarity, we are now able to discuss with them
what could go into a good agreement on Gatt.'
FNSEA, the biggest farm union, said yesterday it had no intention of
relaxing pressure. It called for another commissioner to go to to Washington
with Sir Leon, who it said was 'not trustworthy'.

MOBIL, the US oil company, yesterday said it was interested in exploration
and downstream business in Vietnam, and would bid for the hotly contested
contract to work the Blue Dragon off-shore field, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
A dozen large companies are expected to submit bids by the October 11
deadline for the structure, which some regard as Vietnam's most promising
unworked off-shore field.
Mr Robert J. Aberbach, Singapore-based vice-president of Mobil Eastern
Exploration and Development, said there was no basis for speculation that
the deal was being reserved for Mobil as a lever on Washington to lift its
economic embargo against Hanoi.
Other companies expected to bid for the business include Amoco and Phillips
Petroleum of the US, Shell (UK-Dutch) and British Petroleum.

US pharmaceutical companies expressed dismay yesterday at the health reform
plan. They warned that it could force them to cut spending on the
development of new drugs.
Drug stocks staged a small recovery, however, after their steep falls in
recent months on early indications of the shape of the Clinton plan.
Senior drug company executives generally expressed support for President
Bill Clinton's aims in reforming the healthcare system, but objected to the
price controls and forced rebates in the plan.
The proposal to monitor prices on new drugs, the requirement for drugs
companies to offer larger rebates to Medicare, and the overall cap on
healthcare spending, prompted the most dismay among leading drugs company
executives.
'New Medicare rebates would increase the corporate tax burden by billions of
dollars a year, taking money from new drug research budgets,' said Mr Ray
Egan, senior vice-president of Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'Research and
development would be less likely because it would be more difficult to
recover the costs associated with bringing a new drug to market.'
Schering-Plough warned: 'Rebates, rationing and global budgets - all a form
of mandatory price controls - pose a major threat to the continued viability
of the pharmaceutical industry. Such controls will inevitably curtail R&amp;D
risk-taking.'
The US drugs companies claimed that market pressure for lower healthcare
costs had already led to a sharp fall in drug price inflation, and that this
process should be allowed to continue unhindered by regulation.
All the leading US drug stocks rose yesterday, with the biggest gains seen
by Pfizer, up Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 1/2 , and Schering Plough, up Dollars
2 to Dollars 65 1/4 . But the rises come after declines which have wiped
about 40 per cent off the value of the biggest drug companies this year.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Coverage and a card for all: The main promises in the
package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CENTRAL promise of the Clinton health plan is coverage for everyone from
the cradle to the grave. All US citizens and legal residents would receive a
health security card, the size of a credit card, guaranteeing a defined
package of benefits as extensive as most plans offered by big US companies
today.
Guaranteed coverage:
Nobody could be refused coverage because of an existing health condition or
the illness of a dependent. Insurance companies would have to apply
'community rating' so that everybody would pay the same premium regardless
of age or state of health.
Benefits would include preventive care, doctor visits, hospital care,
prescription drugs, emergency services, mental health care, treatment for
drug and alcohol abuse, expanded home care for long-term patients, eyesight
and hearing treatment, and dental care for children.
Coverage would start in some states in 1995 and be fully phased in by the
end of 1997.
Health alliances:
Each state would create one or more regional health alliances, which would
function as purchasing co-operatives, bargaining with insurers to obtain the
best rates on health plans.
Most people would be enrolled in these alliances through their employers, as
would self-employed individuals, part-time workers and the unemployed.
Companies with more than 5,000 employees would be free to opt out, but would
be taxed for this.
Alliances would offer members a menu of different health plans, including at
least one plan with traditional fees for service coverage.
Health plans:
Alliances would conduct an 'open season' once a year (just as the US
government does today for federal employees), in which members could choose
to switch health plans.
A typical menu of plans would include a high-cost option like many current
insurance plans. That is, customers could choose their doctor but would pay
any cost above what is called a deductible - for individuals Dollars 200
(Pounds 132) a year, for families Dollars 400 - plus a separately calculated
20 per cent, called a co-payment, of virtually all charges.
The lowest-cost option would probably involve enrolment in a health
maintenance organisation (HMO), with no annual deductible and just a Dollars
100 fee for each visit to the doctor. However, the customer would have to
pay 40 per cent of the cost of any visit to a doctor outside the HMO.
A middle-cost option might have higher monthly premiums but lower
co-payments if the customer were to choose a doctor outside the HMO.
Who pays?:
Employers would be compelled to pay at least 80 per cent of the average
premium charged by the health alliance, so the amount paid by each
individual would depend on whether they chose a cheaper or more expensive
plan.
The amount any employer would have to pay would be capped at 7.9 per cent of
the payroll, with additional discounts on a sliding scale for businesses
with fewer than 50 employees so as to reduce their contribution to a level
between 3.5 and 7.9 per cent.
If employers offer more than the standard package, this will progressively
become a taxable benefit.
The jobless would continue to pay the 20 per cent employee share, but
employed and unemployed would receive a discount if their incomes were less
than 150 per cent of the poverty level.
Self-employed people would be able to deduct 100 per cent of their premiums
from their taxable income.
Cost controls:
The health alliances are expected to bring market forces to bear on the
health insurance market, and administrative savings are expected from
simplified paperwork.
However, the plan also includes an enforceable cap in the rate of growth of
health insurance premiums. These are expected, by the end of the decade, to
be held to the rate of inflation.
Financing:
The plan needs to finance both the expansion of coverage to the estimated
37m people with no health insurance and the increased benefits such as
prescription drugs and home care - in all, new spending projected at Dollars
45bn in 1996 and rising to Dollars 83bn in 2000.
Most projected savings come from controlling the growth of the Medicare and
Medicaid programmes, two existing federal health plans covering the elderly
and the poor. The plan forecasts savings rising from Dollars 14bn in 1996 to
Dollars 86bn in 2000.
An extra 75 cents to Dollars 1 tax on a packet of cigarettes, and a tax on
big companies that opt out of regional health alliances, would together
raise Dollars 15bn to Dollars 16bn a year.
The programme is forecast to cost the federal government a net Dollars 14bn
in 1996-1997, but to save it Dollars 86bn in the next three years.

FT  24 SEP 93 / IMF chief warns of Gatt danger

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary
Fund, yesterday warned that the world could forget about the prospects of
stronger growth if negotiators failed to bring the Uruguay Round of trade
talks to a successful conclusion.
He said the trade talks were the number one item on the world's economic
agenda and leadership was needed on all sides to complete them.
A full agenda faced the ministers and central bank governors from the IMF's
178 member countries in the days ahead, he said. The world economy was
facing several problems which could have a 'devastating' effect if trends
were not reversed.
He singled out high and rising unemployment, anaemic growth, the weak fiscal
situation in many countries and protectionist pressures as negative factors
weighing on the global economy.
Mr Camdessus said the world should build on its success in lowering
inflation and the 'outstanding' performance of many fast growing developing
nations to achieve greater growth.
He said countries should press ahead with structural adjustment programmes
to modernise their economies, open their domestic markets to imports and
press ahead with fiscal consolidation as soon as recovery was established.
He called on European nations to make their labour markets more flexible and
urged those countries with room to manoeuvre to cut their interest rates.
The IMF managing director also urged a strengthening of the international
monetary system through greater co-operation in the G7, more economic
convergence among members of the Europeam Monetary System and greater
acceptance of surveillance of economic policies by the IMF.
He said he hoped that the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank would
move towards agreeing finance for a successor to the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment facility.
Mr Camdessus said he would be satisfied if some progress were made towards a
new allocation of Special Drawing Rights, the IMF's own reserve asset, to
Fund members.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the United Nations, yesterday
called for an overhaul of the way in which the UN takes decisions on
peacekeeping, and said the US would use force unilaterally where its vital
interests were at stake.
Ms Albright said UN decision-making must be 'overhauled' so that no foreign
troops were sent 'in harm's way without a clear mission, competent
commanders, sensible rules of engagement and the means required to get the
job done'.
However, the US would not abandon its right to act alone. 'President Clinton
will not hesititate to act as a commander in chief to protect America and
Americans,' she said, citing such examples as the US intervention in Panama,
pursuit of terrorists, and President Ronald Reagan's decision to apprehend
the hijackers of the Achille Lauro cruise ship.
This was the third Clinton administration foreign policy address this week,
setting the stage for his appearance at the UN General Assembly next Monday.
The speech echoed a Senate foreign 1relations committee report in August. It
said troops going into arenas of war must be given clear mandates from the
beginning of operations and a realistic time frame of action so operations
may be properly planned and implemented.
Congress has grown concerned about US involvement in Somalia and plans in
Bosnia. A House appropriations committee this week approved Dollars 383m for
future peacekeeping operations, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.
It attached a requirement the president inform the committee 15 days before
sending troops to an international humanitarian effort. He would have to
state the estimated cost of the operation, how it will be funded, its
projected duration, scope and goals.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARTISAN battle lines were being drawn in the US yesterday after President
Bill Clinton's address to Congress on Wednesday night in which he outlined
his ambitious plans for health care reform.
After weeks in which Republican leaders had been expressing their admiration
for the work put in by Mr Clinton and his wife on the reforms, it took just
minutes for the pretence of bipartisan compromise to evaporate.
While some Republican right wingers such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia have been critical all along of Mr
Clinton's plan, most of the Republican leadership has seen much in common
with their own approaches to reform.
Congresswoman Nancy Johnson of Connecticut patronisingly and inaccurately
called Mr Clinton a latecomer to the debate over health care, and said his
plan would create a 'one size fits all' state run monopoly.
Senator Connie Mack of Florida attacked the government's role in Mr
Clinton's health care proposals. 'It's loaded with more spending and more
bureaucracy. It will devastate jobs and our economy. It will lead us to a
system of government controlled health care at a cost of Dollars 700bn,' he
said.
The White House yesterday issued a statement deploring the Republican
response.
'This health care system of ours is badly broken and it is time to fix it,'
Mr Clinton said in his speech.
The Republican criticism focussed on some of the questions likely to be at
the heart of debate in the next few months: would Mr Clinton's reform reduce
the ability to choose your own doctor? Would it produce a new and cumbersome
federal bureaucracy? Should employers have to pay for most of their workers'
health care costs? Is there enough money to be saved to pay for expanded
coverage?
Opinion polls have for some time suggested the Republicans would have a hard
time making their case.
Instant polling after Mr Clinton's speech on Wednesday night by both USA
Today/Gallup and the Washington Post/ABC showed that 55-56 per cent now
favoured his reform plan ' a substantial leap in approval. Most expected no
reduction in their own medical choices.

The US health insurance industry, which would bear the brunt of price
controls under the healthcare plan, took a conciliatory approach yesterday,
applauding the aim of reducing costs and extending coverage, Richard Waters
writes from New York.
However, leading companies continued to oppose the ceiling on insurance
premiums proposed in earlier drafts.
Met Life, one of the big five insurers, said his plan 'contains extensive
price controls, payroll-based financing and regulatory health alliances
which would make managed competition unworkable.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / Big US companies give welcome but fear extra cost
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIG US companies gave a subdued welcome to the Clinton plan yesterday,
expressing support for an overhaul of the health care system but concern
about the extra bureaucracy and cost that it might bring.
Xerox, which was singled out by President Bill Clinton in his speech to
Congress on Wednesday night for bringing down the cost of health coverage
for its employees, was among those to express caution about the reforms.
'We think there could be extra costs for a company like us, just in keeping
the government informed of what we are doing,' Xerox said. Under the Clinton
plan, companies which operate their own managed care arrangements, and which
have more than 5,000 employees, will be able to offer health care as now.
However, they will have to show they meet certain standards and report
regularly to state regulators.
Like other big companies, Xerox said it was too early to assess the impact
of the president's proposed payroll tax on companies which continued to
offer their own health plans, outside the 'health alliances'. However, the
proposed tax, yet to be quantified, was one of the main reasons for the
muted reaction from big business yesterday.
Companies in industries likely to benefit from the changes, meanwhile, were
more forthcoming with their praise for the plan. The big three US car
companies, among those expected to benefit most, all issued statements
supporting the plan. 'Credit should be given to President Clinton for
finally forcing the issue - his six-principle plan is the most comprehensive
and far-reaching ever offered,' said Mr Harold Poling, chairman and chief
executive of Ford.
Chrysler added that, by controlling overall health care spending and
spreading the costs among businesses more evenly, the plan would 'stimulate
the economy and promote job growth.'
The big car companies would benefit from the proposal to shift some of the
health care costs of early retirees to the state, and from the planned
ceiling on health care costs for employees, put at 7.9 per cent of total
payroll costs.
Small business representatives continued to oppose the requirement that all
employers meet at least 80 per cent of their employees' health care costs.
Mr Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent
Businesses, said small businesses were 'appreciative' of the president's
efforts in tackling one of their biggest and most troubling costs. However,
he added: 'Forcing employers to pay for health insurance is nothing more
than a hidden, regressive tax on jobs. It falls most heavily on those who
can least afford it - smaller, marginal businesses and their lower-wage
employees.'
Mr Faris also warned that the new arrangements could turn out to be more
costly than projected in the Clinton plan. 'Small business owners will have
few options to contain costs if the system fails or is slow to get started,'
Mr Faris said.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Croatia wants UN to disarm Serb rebels

<TEXT>
CROATIA said yesterday it would demand more muscle for United Nations
peacekeepers to disarm Serb rebels. Otherwise it would refuse to renew the
international body's mandate at the end of this month.
The Croatian cabinet called for the 14,000-strong peacekeeping force to
disarm Serb rebels who have set up their own state within Croatia or
withdraw within two months. Impatient with Serbian intransigence, Zagreb has
previously demanded Nato muscle to assert control over Serb rebels.
Croat officials have criticised the UN's failure to fulfil the Vance plan,
agreed in January 1992, which called for the disbanding of Serb militias in
Croatia's four UN zones and the return of refugees.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, this week accused Zagreb of
'willfully misreading' the role of the peacekeepers. He recommended the
extension of the mandate by six months but emphasised that negotiations were
the only way to solve the conflict.
The deployment of the peacekeepers in 1992 froze the six-month war. But the
peace plan was sidelined when war erupted in Bosnia.
In a stark reminder of the continuing violence, UN officials said the bodies
of 66 Serbs, many burned and mutilated, had been recovered after Croat
forces seized three Serb-held villages.
'The corpses were in terrible condition - burned, charred, hacked and so
forth,' Mr Cedric Thornberry, UN civil affairs director, said in Zagreb. UN
officials said the condition of the corpses made it impossible to confirm
Serb claims that at least 30 people were civilians.
Meanwhile in Sarajevo, Bosnia's wartime parliament will meet on Tuesday to
vote on the plan for partition of the republic.
Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic yesterday held talks with Mr Douglas
Hurd, UK foreign secretary, to thank Britain for helping to secure his
release from detention this summer.
The Foreign Office said Mr Draskovic, who is in London with his wife as a
guest of the government, would hold further talks about the situation in
Serbia.
The Foreign Office decision to receive Mr Draskovic seems to mark an another
attempt by Britain to step up pressure on the Serb government to counter
accusations that Britain has not acted with sufficient resolve in the former
Yugoslavia.

BANKRUPTCIES in western Germany increased by 26.9 per cent in the first half
of the year, with more than 6,000 companies becoming insolvent, the Federal
Statistics Office reported yesterday,
Small and medium-sized enterprises unable to weather the domestic recession
formed the bulk of bankruptcies. Only 108 bankruptcies led to creditors
having claims of more than DM10m (Pounds 4m), and 1,179 bankruptcies led to
claims of above DM1m.
But the average bankruptcy size increased from the first half of 1992 as
creditors' financial claims doubled to DM8.4bn for the first six months of
this year.
Bankruptcies in eastern Germany increased by 129 per cent for the period,
with creditors' claims reaching DM2.2bn in the region.
In western Germany, 40 per cent of bankruptcies were in manufacturing.
The number of bankruptcies this year is likely to reach the high levels
recorded in the mid-1980s, the Cologne-based Institute for the German
Economy said. Bankruptcies in Germany peaked in 1985.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Bosnia given a different path to peace: New negotiating
tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD OWEN and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators shuttling
between Balkan capitals, insist that a peace agreement on Bosnia 'is closer
than ever before'.
The phrase is familiar and as the Bosnian parliament prepares to discuss the
latest peace plan on Tuesday, objections by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the
Bosnian president, could still puncture their hopes. But the negotiating
tactics are different this time.
Lord Owen's sudden optimism is not entirely disingenuous. In recent weeks,
there have been some significant shifts in the mediators' approach which
could yet push the sides into signing a deal.
On the one hand, knowing that western governments are anxious for a swift
peace, regardless of what kind of rump Bosnian state remains for the
Moslems, the mediators have stepped up political and psychological pressure
on the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government to accept the 30 per cent now on
offer.
Deprived by the international community of any muscle to reverse Serb and
Croat military gains in Bosnia, the mediators have been using secret
meetings as their main weapon - a tactic that has left them shuttling among
the Balkan capitals.
They could be sipping wine with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in
Belgrade one evening, leaving at dawn to investigate Adriatic ports, before
meeting Croatian President Franjo Tudjman the next day.
The second shift has been in the mediators' ambitions. Instead of aiming for
a final land deal, they have been pushing the sides to sign an overall peace
agreement first, leaving some thorny territorial details, such as Sarajevo,
or the boundaries of the Moslem enclaves in the east, to be disentangled
later through joint working groups.
The approach seems to owe much to the Middle East negotiations -
negotiations which Mr Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian foreign minister,
initially participated in.
'There has been a shift,' admits one diplomat closely involved in the
negotiation, who says that, as in the Middle East, some territorial issues
are easier sorted out when the fighting has stopped.
'It is easier to leave the details to a time when people have stopped
fighting each other,' he says.
It is a tactic that seems, on the surface, not without risks. As Mr John
Mills, spokesman for the negotiators, admitted several weeks ago, the devil
in the discussions so far has been in the detail. And after 18 months of
bloodshed, in which bitter battles have been fought for tiny chunks of land,
leaving territorial issues open will leave some local commanders hoping to
settle the uncertainties with force later.
But as the envoys themselves repeatedly stress, winter is approaching. In
spite of the recent flare up in fighting, all three sides seem militarily
exhausted.
And, more significantly, both the Serbs and Croats now have considerable
motives to sue for peace.
Since the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia, they have
improved their position considerably, and Mr Milosevic is anxious to reach a
deal to lift the sanctions on Serbia.
In spite of ceding partial sea access to the Moslems last week, control over
the Croat-dominated regions of western Hercegovina will also leave the Croat
leadership achieving most of their territorial aims in Bosnia.
'Milosevic and Tudjman are hurrying to make their conquests official. We are
not hurrying to make a general agreement,' says Mr Muhamed Filipovic, a
Moslem opposition politician.
Although Mr Izetbegovic has responded to mediators' optimistic outbursts by
demanding more concessions - demands which gained him an extra 0.5 per cent
of territory earlier this week - he has little reason to believe that he
will succeed in negotiating a favourable settlement later.
It seems unlikely that Mr Izetbegovic can postpone his endorsement of the
partition plan for much longer.
But for a broad peace deal to stick - and the territorial 'details' to be
resolved - the mediators will need to ensure a rapid deployment of
peacekeeping troops.
Although it seems that Nato is preparing for deployment, with US President
Bill Clinton's commitment still unclear and many in the alliance uncertain
about who will pay for the force, ensuring whether the troops will be able
to get there fast enough remains yet another great uncertainty.

dining out in five-star hotels in Berlin, and the inefficient use of energy,
the Federal Court of Auditors said yesterday.
In a measured, but critical 220-page annual report about how unification has
been used to run up unnecessary expenses, the Court of Auditors concluded
that unless waste is cut, the finance authorities will be left with little
room to manoeuvre.
But the report by the Court of Auditors, an independent institution which
acts as a watchdog in monitoring how budgets are spent in the state sector,
also reveals Germany's propensity for bureaucracy and waste.
For instance, if thermostats which regulate the temperature of water and
heating were installed in state-run housing and enterprises, it would save
over DM100m (Pounds 40m).
At the moment, heating in many public institutions can only be controlled by
opening or closing the windows. If a new computer was installed in the
eastern German railway network, it would save DM27m, as well as cutting the
numbers of personnel who spend a great deal of time writing out tickets by
hand.
The Court of Auditors also reckons that the eastern railways bureaucracy is
employing between 20,000 and 30,000 people too many, which is costing the
taxpayer between DM1.3bn and DM1.8bn a year.
The Patent office comes under scrutiny too. When the two offices were merged
after unification, the staff swelled from 180 to 588, many of whom are
simply not needed, the auditors argue.
Unification also gave western German officials sent to Berlin to open
branches of the federal ministries an excuse to spend up to DM137 a day on
lunch in the city's five-star hotels.
Even the Treuhand is criticised. The auditors call for much greater control
over the privatisation agency's operations and finances.

UKRAINE'S President Leonid Kravchuk said yesterday early elections could
help to overcome obstacles to the removal of remaining nuclear weapons from
its territory. In the meantime, he said, Ukraine was dismantling part of the
arsenal.
He told Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, he hoped for rapid
agreement on staging parliamentary elections following Mr Leonid Kuchma's
resignation as prime minister on Tuesday after a no-confidence vote. Ukraine
is to transfer nuclear arms to Russia in exchange for nuclear fuel for power
stations, under an agreement three weeks ago. But prospects for doing so
remain blocked by difficulties over parliamentary ratification.
Mr Kravchuk told Mr Rifkind Ukraine had already removed the warheads - 60 in
all - from 10 of its older SS-19 strategic missiles and had rendered them
virtually impossible to use. Ten more would be dismantled, starting later
this month.
Ukraine holds 130 SS-19s, including those it says it has dismantled, as well
as 46 SS-24s with 10 warheads each, and about 30 nuclear bombers.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Spain set to approve tough budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S minority socialist government is today set to approve a tough 1994
budget, having been unable to secure full agreement on important wages talks
with the unions or on regional tax concessions with opposition parties whose
support it needs in order to be able to pass it.
The uncertainty surrounding many of the suppositions in the budget - on
pensions, civil service pay, unemployment benefits and tax revenue
distribution - means that the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, could
continue horse trading with the unions and Catalan and Basque parties until
the end of the year, by which time the budget, legally, has to be in place.
Ministers and senior officials insist that the government, which has been
punished for its past fiscal indiscipline by three peseta devaluations in
the last year, intends firmly to stand by its pledge to halt the rapid
growth in its central deficit.
Madrid had hoped, in negotiations started with the unions earlier this
month, to have agreed - and included in the budget - consensus on a new
formula for calculating pensions, on cuts in unemployment benefits, and on a
wages freeze for the civil serve next year.
But these talks - regarded by many as a success simply because no party has
yet walked away from them - have not been able to reach firm conclusions and
the cabinet is set to impose a civil service wage freeze and a public
pension increase next year of 3.5 per cent, which the unions argue is too
low.
These sums will then form part of the budget.
The figures are not, say officials, necessarily set in stone. The government
has said that if the unions agree to a moderate pay over the next three
years, it then might be prepared to consider revising its targets on
pensions and civil service pay as the budget is debated through parliament
for the next three months. This loose arrangement, where deadlines are
flexible and final positions are negotiable, suits the government.
It desperately wants to appear to be tough fiscally while also engineering a
global incomes deal with the unions. Madrid has its eye on the international
financial market which, it fears, may again attack the peseta if it is
perceived to be losing control of the economy.
Talks between the government, unions and employers on a global wages deal -
which the government wants to last for three years - will start in October.
At about the same time the government hopes to have finalised its
controversial proposals for granting the country's autonomous regions the
power to spend 15 per cent of the income tax collected in those regions.
This is a political concession demanded by the Catalans in return for
helping Mr Gonzalez pass the budget.
A scheme, hastily cobbled together since the June 6 general election, has
however run into opposition from both the economically strong Catalans and
poorer states such as Extremadura and Andalucia.
The Catalans say the government is refusing to spell out, exactly, how it
plans to make the transfers and that it does not trust Madrid's willingness
to actually transfer money. Poorer states say they are likely to
progressively lose to the richer regions because of the way the transfer is
being designed.
Despite the threat implicit in this opposition, officials believe that
Catalan support for the budget is assured by the end of the year, despite
complaints from the region's government. 'We are close enough to agreement
to be able to work out the details in the next few weeks,' said one.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Belgium proposes carbon tax
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian Presidency of the EC yesterday called for a carbon energy tax to
offset the costs of reducing employers' mandatory social security
contributions and boosting job creation, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, told the European economic and
social committee in Brussels that the carbon tax should be part of a
European-wide response to the twin challenge of unemployment and the need to
curb state budget deficits.
Mr Dehaene's call came as the Belgian coalition government is struggling to
put together its latest austerity plan aimed at trimming the huge state
budget deficit, and reassuring the financial markets about the stability of
the Belgian franc.
One element is expected to be a reduction in employers' mandatory social
security contributions, with the loss in income to the state being offset by
increased indirect taxes on alcohol and tobacco.
More broadly, it anticipates the White Paper on competitiveness being
prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The
paper, which will examine why Europe is failing to create jobs, is to be the
centrepiece of the EC summit in Brussels in December.
Mr Dehaene said he was counting on the Maastricht treaty being ratified by
Germany in October, so that its provisions could take effect without delay.
These would include a clear demonstration of a common security and foreign
policy, strengthening the European Monetary System, and provisions for
European citizenship.

THE level of wage increases in Europe, as well as social security costs,
needs to be brought down across the Community, according to a majority of EC
employment ministers, meeting in Bruges yesterday, writes David Gardner in
Bruges.
But most also argued that EC social legislation and the European welfare
model could not be ditched in the fight against unemployment.
The meeting, convened to discuss proposals on jobs and competitiveness the
European Commission has been asked to prepare for December's EC summit in
Brussels, heard vigorous calls for real wages to be cut or frozen.
'Wage increases have to be less than the inflation rate,' said Mr Jose
Antonio Grinan, labour minister in Spain's Socialist government.
Senior Dutch officials told the meeting that the Netherlands' Christian
Democrat-Labour coalition would decree 'a legal wage freeze' next year if
both sides of industry could not agree to limit increases.
'I see a sea-change in the whole tone of the debate,' Mr Michael Forsyth, UK
employment minister, said afterwards.
On non-wage costs, one British official at the meeting noted that 'all
member states are now talking about reducing social security costs, and that
is clearly new'.
However, Ms Miet Smet, Belgian president of the meeting, and Mr Padraig
Flynn, the EC commissioner for social affairs, reaffirmed their intention to
push ahead with controversial social legislation long stuck in the EC
pipeline largely because of British opposition.

FT  24 SEP 93 / VW apology for halting Skoda deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the German car manufacturer, yesterday apologised to the Czech
government for its sudden cancellation of a DM1.4bn (Pounds 560m) financing
package for Skoda, its Czech subsidiary, only hours before the deal was due
to be signed in London last week.
VW reaffirmed its commitment to expand and modernise production at Skoda and
promised to increase the variety of cars to be produced at the Czech plant.
'Volkswagen expressed regrets over the embarrassment caused to Skoda's
majority shareholder (the Czech government) by its last-minute decision made
last week,' said a statement issued at the end of a three-hour meeting in
Prague.
The meeting was attended by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW
management board, Mr Werner Schmidt, VW finance director, and Mr Vladimir
Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, as well as Mr Tomas Jezek,
chairman of the National Property Fund, which oversees privatisations.
VW's decision to call off the loan at the last minute came as a shock in
Prague.
Only a day before the announcement, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, had
welcomed the planned financing, which was to be guaranteed by the Czech
government.
VW said the financing package was no longer necessary because productivity
improvements at Skoda meant investment requirements would be considerably
lower than initially planned.
The VW group is undertaking a fundamental review of its capital spending
plans and is expected to announce further far-reaching cuts in November
after a meeting of its supervisory board.
VW took a 31 per cent share in Skoda in 1991 and is due to raise its holding
to 70 per cent by 1996. It had previously announced plans to invest DM7bn
over 10 years, but this figure is now expected to be reduced significantly.
It has planned to more than double Skoda's production capacity to more than
400,000 cars a year, modern-ising its facilities and expanding products with
the introduction of a second car range.
The cancellation of the loan increased fears in Prague that VW was reducing
its commitment to the venture.
Relations between the Czech government and the German carmaker had soured
recently following a dispute caused by Skoda's decision to increase sharply
the prices of its cars, and Czech concerns that VW was no longer interested
in developing a local nework of suppliers.
Neither issue was discussed at yesterday's meeting.

<TEXT>
ROME magistrates yesterday called for the prosecution of Mr Giovanni
Prandini, for allegedly extorting a total of L20.5bn (Pounds 8.5m) in bribes
as Christian Democrat minister of public works from 1989 to 1992. This is
the first time in the 18-month-long corruption scandals that judicial
proceedings have reached such an advanced stage involving a former minister.
Mr Prandini was minister in the seventh government of Mr Guilio Andreotti,
which left office after the April 1992 elections. The prosecution move also
involved Mr Francesco Cafarelli, a Christian Democrat deputy and secretary
of the parliamentnary anti-Mafia commission, and Mr Antio Crespo, the former
head of Anas, the state roads authority. Together they are accused of having
forced 22 businessmen to pay bribes to obtain contracts, mainly connected
with work awarded by Anas.
Mr Prandini is cited as having being linked to 18 different bribery
episodes. Among these, he is alleged to have obliged Mr Antonio Baldi, a
Naples businessman, to buy for L7bn a hotel near Brescia owned by a group
headed by Mr Prandini himself. Court documents claim the purchase price was
L3bn above the market price and Mr Baldi was threatened with exclusion from
future Anas road contracts if he turned down the arrangement.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Bankers to discuss debt rescheduling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and TRACY CORRIGAN

<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS representing Russia's commercial bank creditors, who are owed more
than Dollars 27.5bn (Pounds 17.8bn) by Moscow, including arrears in interest
payments of more than Dollars 3bn, hope to fix a date soon to negotiate a
long-term rescheduling agreement.
Talks are planned in the wings of next week's IMF and World Bank annual
meetings between representatives of the so-called London Club of creditors
and the Russian government. Both sides have talked about the possibility of
arranging at least a five-year grace period for repayments, with a possible
extension to 10 years, to replace the current repeated agreements on 90-day
roll-over periods, banking sources say. The latest roll-over expires at the
end of September.
Dealers in the London market are optimistic that Russia will keep its
commitment, made at a meeting with the creditors in Frankfurt at the end of
July, to repay Dollars 500m in outstanding interest payments to the London
Club over the next three months.
However, there are signs that the banks are becoming angry with Moscow's
failure to provide more money to service its outstanding debts, estimated at
more than Dollars 80bn, split among commercial banks, official creditors,
industrial suppliers, and outstanding bonds.
In a sharp attack this week at a conference in Berlin, Mr Georg Krupp, the
Deutsche Bank director responsible for operations in eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, said it was 'completely incomprehensible' that Russia
could not even find the necessary foreign exchange to make the appropriate
repayments on guaranteed export credits.
He cited Russian figures estimating the total foreign exchange resources of
the country at some Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.9bn), or half its outstanding
foreign debt. The figures include Dollars 6bn in hard currency reserves at
the central bank, Dollars 10bn held by Russian banks outside the country,
Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn circulating within the Russian economy, and as
much as Dollars 20bn held illegally by Russian companies in the west.
Mr Krupp, whose bank chairs the London Club of creditors, said western
creditors could not be expected to pour their money into a bottomless pit.
It was quite right for Hermes, the German export credit insurance agency, to
suspend cover on exports to Russia, given a current exposure of DM207bn
(Pounds 82.8bn).
Russia's failure to make interest payments on commercial debt, other than on
its public bonds, has led to a rapid accumulation of arrears.
According to Russian estimates, still being evaluated by the western
creditors, the debt to commercial banks now totals more than Dollars 27.5bn,
including the latest arrears in interest payments, which come to some
Dollars 1.5bn in 1993 alone. The outstanding debt to government creditors,
including guaranteed export credits, totals some Dollars 37bn, while
supplier credits and bonds total nearly Dollars 12bn.
Including new credits and recent arrears, the total is put at some Dollars
80bn.
The debt calculations include money owed before January 1 1991, when Russia
in effect began to default on repayments, and arrears accumulated since.
Most of the commercial bank debt, or around Dollars 24bn of the Dollars
27.5bn, was owed before 1991, but much of the official debt has been
accumulated since: some Dollars 14bn predates 1991, and Dollars 18.8bn since
the cut-off date.
Interest arrears owing to official creditors up to the end of 1992 totalled
more than Dollars 2bn, according to Russian figures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary
Fund, yesterday suggested that industrialised nations should give bilateral
financial support to Russia in anticipation of the IMF resuming its lending.
He told a press conference that the Fund was working continuously with the
Russian authorities to get their economic reform programme back on track.
The political crisis of the past week was a reason for working still more
closely with the Russians, he said. However, the IMF could not at this stage
provide Russia with financial support because of the deterioration in
Russia's economic policies and performance and the disruption of the
economic reforms agreed with the Fund in the summer.
At the end of June, the IMF provided Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 974m) of support
for Russia under its new temporary systemic transformation facility. A
further transfer of Dollars 1.5bn is due under the STF, while talks have
been held on providing more support through a stand-by arrangement.
Mr Camdessus yesterday indicated that this money would not be forthcoming
before early next year.
He stressed that the IMF support was not determined by the political
calendar or political events in Russia.
Developments in Russia will be discussed by finance ministers and central
bank governors from the Group of Seven nations tomorrow. Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US Treasury secretary and G7 host, disclosed yesterday the Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, would join the group for part of the
discussions.
Mr Bentsen said the US would like to see Russia obtaining the second Dollars
1.5bn of the STF money from the IMF this year, provided it was able to get
its reform programme back on track.
Mr Camdessus's suggestion that industrial countries should consider interim
finance received a fairly cool response at the US Treasury.
A senior Treasury official said he thought it was unlikely that the
industrial countries would provide new finance to Russia in anticipation of
IMF loans.
Reuter adds from Washington: The US Senate last night approved a 1994
foreign aid funding bill containing Dollars 2.5bn for the former Soviet
states after linking aid to Russia to withdrawal of its troops from the
Baltics.
The Dollars 12.5bn bill, passed by 88-10, must now be reconciled with a
previously passed House measure before being sent to President Bill Clinton
for his signature.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: 'Dictator' Yeltsin free to mould new order
 -The president's constitutional blueprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is now a wholly centralised state, lacking, at the federal level,
even the formal bodies of a countervailing power which were present in the
Soviet period.
Until the election of a new parliament in 11 weeks time, Mr Boris Yeltsin,
as president, has the powers of a dictator. The hope that he will not become
one rests upon his promises, and those of his government and aides.
The founding instrument of this new precarious state is Mr Yeltsin's decree,
signed on Tuesday, 'On step-by-step Constitutional reform in the Russian
Federation'. It is a historically important document, for it seeks both to
destroy the old constitutional order which has governed Russia since the
collapse of the Union at the end of 1991 - and provide the basis of the new,
temporary one.
It claims parliament has 'endangered the state and security of the country',
and that Russia, as a new state, needs a new constitution, a new parliament
and new deputies. It sets out a timetable for these elections - on December
12 - and the tasks to be accomplished: A draft constitution must be approved
by a constitutional commission and a constituent assembly. The draft will be
placed before parliament as soon as it meets. A Federation Council, composed
of council leaders from the regions and republics will form the upper
chamber; a state duma with 400 members will form the lower chamber, and will
be elected in December.
The decree abolishes the Soviet-era parliament, both the standing Supreme
Soviet and the occasionally-convened Congress of People's Deputies. It
brings the central bank and the procurator general's office from
parliamentary to governmental control (both Mr Viktor Gerashchenko and Mr
Valenin Stepankov, the Procurator General, formerly hostile to the
government, have pledged loyalty). The Constitutional Court is suspended
until a new parliament is elected.
Though the military has also pledged loyalty, it has become clear that the
bulk of the security function will fall on the Interior Ministry and its
troops. One of the first decisions of the cabinet, on Wednesday, was to pass
a resolution 'On strengthening the defence of social order', which calls for
40,000 more recruits into the interior forces and the founding of a
volunteer corps to patrol neighbourhoods. Though Mr Yeltsin has promised to
use no force, neither Mr Viktor Yerin, the Interior Minister nor General
Pavel Grachev, the Defence Minister, have been so categorical - the latter
promising to return provocation with force.
In the regions, the president claims the adherence of most heads of
administration - though not of the elected councils, where the majority are
probably against him. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister, said no
move would be made against them if they merely expressed opposition - they
would only be dissolved if they attempted to interfere with elections.
As to the deputies still claiming to run the country in the Russian
parliament, Mr Shakhrai said that no move would be made against them -
unless their armed guards themselves opened fire on people, or on buildings.
'We are quite prepared to live with a situation where not everyone agrees
with us,' he said. 'But we can't tolerate a tragedy.'
Mr Yerin, giving the Interior Ministry's estimation of how many people have
so far vocally disagreed with the president, said that only 20,000 people
across 27 cities (excepting Moscow) had demonstrated so far. The Interior
Ministry has, however, kept itself busy by arresting corrupt bureaucrats, he
claimed.
This is, as Mr Shakhrai admitted yesterday, presidential rule. It depends on
the will of the president as to how soon it will become a democracy.

PRESIDENT Yeltsin yesterday named June 12 next year as the date for
presidential elections and indicated he would be a candidate.
Mr Yeltsin said the election was 'really inconvenient ..nevertheless
essential'.
The president was elected in 1991 for a five year term, and until last week
he said he would complete the term and then retire from politics. He now
clearly believes, as he said in April at the summit in Vancouver with
President Bill Clinton, that 'there is no alternative to me as president -
there will be, but not yet'.
While at 62 he is no great age for a politician, Mr Yeltsin's health has
been erratic. He has persistent heart trouble.
Mr Yeltsin's arch-rival in Moscow, General Alexander Rutskoi, is a likely
challenger. Gen Rutskoi, 46, claimed the presidency after Mr Yeltsin
dissolved parliament and he was subsequently appointed president by the
Supreme Soviet. Yesterday he said he would not run for the presidency, but
he is thought to be bluffing.
Gen Rutskoi was elected vice president on the same ticket as Mr Yeltsin  -
chosen for his links with the army, his leadership of the Democratic
Communists (now called the Party of Free Russia) and his influence with
centrist deputies in the then Russian parliament.
Since then, Gen Rutskoi has become deeply antagonistic to Mr Yeltsin. He has
revealed himself as a strong Russian nationalist, and deeply regrets the
loss of power and prestige which the collapse of the Soviet Union brought.
He has, progressively, become more conservative in his economic views -
passing from moderate reformism to espousal of a command system. He has,
however, never taken extreme nationalist or communist positions, and
recently protested when anti-semitic slogans appeared in a cemetery.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, 41, a former Russian deputy premier, made a surprise
announcement of his intention to run for the presidency earlier this year.
One of the last Soviet deputy premiers in the closing months of the
Gorbachev regime, he has recently seen his popularity rating match, then
surpass, that of Mr Yeltsin's himself.
He became known in the west for his authorship and espousal of the 'Grand
Bargain' - an economic reform programme, written with Mr Graham Allison (now
assistant secretary of state at the Pentagon), and Professors Jeffrey Sachs
and Stanley Fischer.
Since leaving government on the collapse of the union, Mr Yavlinsky has
built a reputation as a consultant - mainly to regional governments, and to
former Soviet republics - and as an occasional commentator on current
events.
Mr Yavlinsky has carefully kept himself free of entanglement with any
political faction. In a press conference on Wednesday, he damned both
parliament for being obstructive and the president for the risk he was
taking with the country's stability. His opponents question his competence
as an economist and say he is more politician than thinker. No one doubts
his intelligence, nor his self confidence.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, 37, did not just announce he would stand for president
earlier this year, he said,in a radio interview, that he 'would be'
president at some time. 'The only question,' he said later 'is when.' But
yesterday, Mr Shakhrai seemed to indicate that he would not stand in June if
Mr Yeltsin did.
Trained as a lawyer, with a deliberate and thoughtful manner, Mr Shakhrai is
credited with much of the tactical thinking in the Yeltsin camp. His current
post, deputy prime minister in charge of nationalities policy, keeps his
profile high and his contacts with the republics and regions fresh. He has
recently founded his own party, based on regional support, and is regarded
universally as a serious candidate for high office.
Mr Mikhail Bocharov, 52, a successful businessman who was almost Russia's
prime minister (in 1991) announced his intention to stand for the presidency
in July - to no great reaction. Though credited with competence and
influence, Mr Bocharov's political star has waned: he has thrown his lot in
with centrist forces, and published an economic programme 'Resurrection',
which sees market development being guided by a strong state.
The only other declared candidate is Mr Vladimir Zhjirinovsky, 47, leader of
the Liberal Democratic Party, Russia's best known and most vocal fascist.

THE RUSSIAN government announced emergency measures to defend the rouble
yesterday after it plunged 18 per cent against the dollar to Rbs1,299. The
rouble's fall was blamed on the political crisis, an end to central bank
dollar sales, and loose monetary policy.
The emergency measures included an increase in the central bank's discount
rate from 170 per cent to 200 per cent. It had earlier lifted the rate to
180 per cent. The government also recommended that Sberbank, Russia's
biggest savings bank, increase its savings rate.
The central bank, placed under direct government control in Mr Yeltsin's
decree on Tuesday, last increased the discount rate in July.
Mr George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier, promised Dollars 250m in new
aid for Russia's education system during a meeting with Mr Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow yesterday.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Moscow literati feel a sad optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREI OSTALSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE MANY of the Russian people, Moscow's intellectuals and cultural elite
are trying to come to grips with the political drama in Moscow and to
measure the likelihood of armed conflict or civil war.
'Bloodshed must be avoided at any cost, everything else comes second,' says
Mr Mikhail Yermakov, a former space programme engineer turned entrepreneur.
Mr Yermakov says he does not care too much who wins in the stand-off as long
as there is no violence. But most of the intelligentsia are more
politicised, with the majority siding with Mr Yeltsin.
'I am just plain happy that it has happened at last,' says Mr Bulat
Okudzhava, a poet and writer. 'It's a pity that it took so long for the
president to make up his mind to act decisively.'
Many in Moscow see Mr Okudzhava as the 'conscience' of the Russian literary
world. Now he calls himself a 'sad optimist' - understanding the depth of
the problems facing the Russian people, he still believes in a positive
outcome. And in Mr Yeltsin, too.
'The president and the government commit terrible blunders all the time, but
at least they are the learners, at least they do understand the absolute
necessity of very profound reforms, while their opponents are hopeless,' he
says.
Mr Okudzhava is one of an influential group of writers who, while wary of Mr
Yeltsin's style, would rather see him in power than his rivals.
Mr Vladlen Sirotkin, a historian and a professor at the prestigious
Diplomatic Academy, says he is 'bewildered and baffled by what both sides
are doing. Why, for God's sake, should Mr Khasbulatov, the speaker of the
parliament, provoke Mr Yeltsin in such a way? And why should Mr Yeltsin let
himself be duped by this provocation into such an illegal action?' Mr
Sirotkin believes the main danger lies in the regions. 'The local councils
(elected) will support the parliament and the regional administrations
(appointed by Mr Yeltsin) in most cases will side with the president. Isn't
it the recipe for civil war? Finally, they will all lose faith in central
institutions and they will try to secede.'
And what does he think of the position taken by the west? Not much. 'The
only thing that matters for the west is that somebody stays in full control
of the nukes. And Yeltsin suits them in this role because they are used to
him and because he's been popularly elected and has won the recent
referendum.'
Mr Okudzhava is much more impressed with the west's support of Mr Yeltsin.
'It is absolutely wonderful that the west is so unanimous in supporting Mr
Yeltsin so firmly. You could easily see on television how terribly angry
those idiots in the parliament were with the western reaction.'
Mrs Yelena Schelina, an engineer and a senior manager at the Institute for
Patent Research, stresses that the danger of street violence is something
which terrifies nearly everybody, regardless of their political beliefs. But
it is more likely that Mr Yeltsin will pull it off this time, she says.
But what about Mr Alexander Rutskoi? 'I used to respect him but don't any
more. I think most of the Russians are disappointed in him. Khasbulatov is
just using him to get backing from the army,' she says.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Poll pledge by Yeltsin as deputies defy decree: Government
says parliament action could 'trigger war'

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin announced yesterday he was likely to stand for
re-election in an early presidential poll next June, as Russian
parliamentary deputies met in special session to defy his decree casting
them aside.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the legislature's speaker, opened the meeting of the
Congress of People's Deputies despite Mr Yeltsin's decree on Tuesday
dissolving parliament ahead of elections for a new-style body in December.
The deputies ignored a government warning that the mutinous gathering could
'trigger war'.
Fuelling tension in Moscow, Russian news agencies reported a policeman had
been killed and another wounded by unidentified gunmen in a foiled attempt
last night to break into the military headquarters of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, the successor to the former Soviet Union.
One agency said the gunmen were hard-line army officers who support Russia's
conservative parliament in its struggle with Mr Yeltsin and the reformers
around him.
A crowd of 2,000 anti-Yeltsin campaigners last night cheered a decision of
the Congress, meeting at Moscow's White House, to uphold a vote on Wednesday
by a smaller parliamentary body, the Supreme Soviet, to impeach Mr Yeltsin.
Deputy prime minister Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a close aide to Mr Yeltsin, said
the authorities had no intention of forcibly expelling deputies from the
White House.
But General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, said police and interior
ministry troops 'were ready to use force against groups of bandits if
provocation threatened peoples' lives' at the gathering.
The government said it was cutting off financing for parliament and taking
over its buildings, its newspaper and its television programmes.
'The whole question is now a war of nerves. The question is who will make
the first mistake,' said Mr Andrei Fyodorov, an aide to Mr Alexander
Rutskoi, the vice-president installed by parliament as temporary president.
Mr Rutskoi, who last night endorsed so far ineffectual calls for a general
strike across Russia in protest at Mr Yeltsin's moves, made clear he would
not stand in the next poll for president.
Mr Yeltsin showed his readiness to put his job on the line along with the
deputies by promising an early presidential poll on June 12, six months
after parliamentary elections and two years ahead of schedule.
He also embarked on a strategy combining intimidation and seduction to
convince deputies and regional councils to give up their resistance to his
moves to break Russia's political deadlock.
A majority of Russia's 88 local councils have joined deputies in denouncing
as unconstitutional the decree dissolving parliament and convening fresh
elections to a modern bicameral assembly. By contrast, only four of the 88
local governments - which, unlike the councils, are mostly appointed by the
president - have come out against Mr Yeltsin.
The government said that only those councils which actually blocked
preparations for elections would be dissolved.
It warned deputies they would be liable to criminal prosecution for
disobeying the president's decree, but said they would be forgiven if they
gave up.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Kuwait misled UK over buyer of Dollars 1.7bn BP stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT misled the UK government about the identity of the purchaser of a
21.7 per cent stake in British Petroleum in the late 1980s. As a result, it
received more than Pounds 600m in tax refunds to which it was not entitled.
According to detailed testimony from a former senior Kuwaiti official, the
Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) stake was bought in late 1987 and early 1988
for the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, Kuwait's national oil company. Until
now, Kuwait has always maintained that the buyer was the Kuwait Investment
Office on behalf of the state fund, the Reserve for Future Generations.
The official, who cannot be named because he fears reprisals, says the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which investigated the BP investment, the
British government and the Inland Revenue were all misled about the identity
of the buyer.
His statement has been corroborated by a past Kuwaiti minister and two
former KIO employees and is also supported by copies of Swiss bank
statements which show that the KIO manages KPC's funds.
KPC ownership of the shares may mean that more than Pounds 600m of tax
refunds which Kuwait has received on income from the BP shares is repayable.
This includes a Pounds 458m payment which the Inland Revenue made to the KIO
in the spring of 1989 as part of a complicated deal by which BP bought back
more than half the stake from Kuwait.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday: 'I will call for a
statement from the chancellor on this extraordinary loss of tax revenue . .
. I want an independent inquiry into it.'
Kuwait received the Pounds 600m of tax credits because the KIO, as an arm of
the Kuwaiti government, is treated in the UK as a sovereign for tax
purposes. Under an international convention, sovereigns do not pay tax.
However, companies set up by issuing shares, such as the KPC, do not qualify
for sovereign immunity.
'Sovereign immunity is being abused,' said Mr Brown, who co-incidentally has
been considering whether the Labour party should commit itself to a policy
of narrowing the scope of this tax privilege, which tax experts say costs
the Inland Revenue billions of pounds in some years.
The best known beneficiaries of this convention are the hugely wealthy
oil-producing states such as Abu Dhabi, Brunei and Kuwait, which have built
up large portfolios of securities and property in the UK and other
industrialised countries.
The disclosure of Kuwait's ruse to disguise the ownership of the BP shares
is certain to complicate relations between the UK and one of its closest
Gulf allies.
The Financial Times has obtained documentary evidence that the KIO has
managed KPC's funds for 10 years. This secret arrangement between the KIO
and the KPC has been confirmed by the president of the KIO, Mr Rashaid
Al-Badr. 'We manage money for the KPC,' he said.
Mr Al-Badr, however, said he did not believe the KPC had bought the BP
shares, although he was not at the KIO at the time of the BP raid.
A former Kuwaiti official said he understood that the remaining 9.7 per cent
holding in BP had now been transferred out of KPC's special account at the
KIO and into the KIO's main portfolio. However, he said he believed that
income from the BP shares was still being transferred to the KPC account.
A large part of KPC's investments managed by the KIO, which eventually
totalled Dollars 5bn, was hidden in a specially created account, the Number
Two account, at a Swiss bank, Lombard Odier. It was managed by the late Mr
Trevor Ball, who was the KIO's chief investment manager until he died in
1991.
The Inland Revenue finds itself in a difficult position. It is aware of the
evidence that the purchaser of the BP shares was the KPC.
However, when giving Kuwait the Pounds 458m tax credit in 1988, it received
a statement from Kuwait that the shares were directly owned by the state and
therefore qualified for tax immunity. 'It is not easy to challenge a
statement made by a sovereign', said a UK official, 'especially one of our
main allies in the Gulf.'

FT  24 SEP 93 / Manchester gives its all on the last lap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE COULD not have done anything more to win,' Mr Bob Scott, chairman of
Manchester's Olympic bid, said as delegates from the International Olympic
Committee voted on where to stage the 2000 Games.
The feeling among Mancunians was that, win or lose, the city's bid
represented Britain's best effort.
Those supporting Manchester's bid included Mr John Major, the prime
minister, Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, political and business leaders
and a galaxy of sporting stars.
It was the second time Manchester had reached this stage in the contest to
host the world's biggest sporting event.
To get this far it had to beat rival British bids from Birmingham, for the
1996 games, and London for the 2000 games.
Adding to the attraction of Manchester's bid was a guarantee by John Major
that costs would be met, an athlete's village within walking distance of
most events, the UK's position as a stable democracy, the country's best
regional transportation infrastructure of roads, railways and airport, and
good telecommunications.
Mr Scott's team persuaded 79 of the IOC's 91 members to visit Manchester -
more than went to any other bidding city.
However, this was a double-edged weapon, for there was a risk of confirming
Manchester's problem of lack of glamour. After Atlanta won the race for
1996, Mr Sebastian Coe, a double Olympic gold medallist and now a
Conservative MP, said only London had enough status and prestige to win for
Britain.
London lost to Manchester, however, because it could not get a single
bidding team together and because it was felt that the city's over-stretched
infrastructure would hinder the logistics of staging the games.
The crucial phase of Manchester's campaign was in 1990 and 1991 when Mr
Major was persuaded of the economic value of winning the games - calculated
by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, as Pounds 4bn of added value,
more than 11,000 jobs and Pounds 400m of tax revenues.
With 20 marginal seats in north-west England and a general election looming,
Manchester received Pounds 75m from the government to help fund the bid and
start building a velodrome and indoor arena.

FT  24 SEP 93 / Former LUI directors may face disqualification moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is considering disqualification actions
against former directors of London United Investments, the insolvent
insurance group, following a highly critical inspectors' report.
The report, published yesterday, says that between 1970 and 1989 about
Pounds 40m in commissions was 'wrongfully diverted' through HS Weavers, an
underwriting subsidiary of LUI, and CR Driver, an underwriter which did
business with the group, to companies in Germany and Liechtenstein.
These companies were controlled by Mr Graham Smith, an accountant since
debarred from the profession, who refused to co-operate with the inspectors.
The report criticises Mr Charles Driver, Mr Henry Weavers, who has died, and
Mr Peter Wilson. All three were directors of LUI. It also criticises Mr
Stanley Mayhew, a director of CR Driver. All denied the accusations.
The DTI said it was beginning disqualification proceedings, but would not
specify against which directors. Its insurance division said it was also
considering action to debar any directors from taking positions with
insurance companies.
The inspectors' report makes some criticisms of the procedures used by KPMG
Peat Marwick, auditors to LUI and Weavers, and Billsons Cullen, now part of
Kingston Smith, which was auditor to Weavers until 1987.
The conclusions appear to lend support to civil and criminal action
triggered by the collapse of LUI in 1990 and of associated companies.
The Serious Fraud Office and City of London police launched an inquiry into
suspected offences of fraud at LUI and its subsidiaries after a referral
from the DTI in April 1992.
The SFO said yesterday that its investigations were continuing. Requests for
assistance from the authorities in Switzerland and Liechtenstein are
currently on appeal in the two countries' supreme courts.
The 316-page document was written by Mr Angus Gilroy and Mr William Gage,
who were commissioned by the DTI in October 1990 to examine the collapse of
LUI. Their inquiry was extended to include CR Driver in January 1992. The
investigation cost Pounds 2.3m.
The inspectors were unable to trace the final destination of the money, but
said they believed Mr Driver, Mr Weavers and Mr Wilson had 'derived some
financial benefit' from the transactions.
The DTI has also sent copies of the report to the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, and to the Lloyd's insurance market.

<TEXT>
DRESDEN Papier, one of eastern Germany's largest paper manufacturers, has
been bought by Mercer International, of the US, to establish a foothold in
Germany's expanding market for paper recycling and production, writes Judy
Dempsey in Berlin.
The sale of Dresdner Papier, which last year recorded a turnover of DM141m
(Dollars 87m), and produced more than 200,000 tons of paper, also means that
the eastern state of Saxony is set to become one of the major centres for
pulp, paper, and recycling production in the region.
Mercer International will invest more than DM80m over the next three years.
The purchase price was not disclosed.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bourse suspends CBR shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the shares of CBR, the Belgian cement group, was suspended
yesterday on the Brussels bourse pending an announcement today.
Meanwhile, Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company which
owns a 43 per cent stake in CBR, unexpectedly brought forward announcement
of its interim results to today.
Analysts immediately speculated that La Generale was preparing to sell all
or part of its stake in the cement company. Neither CBR nor La Generale
would comment on yesterday's market developments.
La Generale has made no secret of its desire to reduce exposure to cyclical
industrial stocks and has been seeking 'industrial partners' for some of its
main holdings. The Belgian authorities did not suspend the shares of the
holding company. They rose BFr60 to close at BFr2,590.
CBR's shares were suspended at lunchtime yesterday at BFr11,475, against
BFr11,250 at the start of trading. The shares will remain suspended
throughout today's session. 'If they're suspending CBR for more than a day,
(the announcement) has got to be more than CBR buying something,' said one
analyst.
At the suspension price, CBR would be worth a total of more than BFr50bn
(Dollars 1.45bn). Potential buyers would have to decide whether to buy out
La Generale's stake at less than the market price, or pay a small premium
and trigger a bid for the whole company.
Only this week, Lafarge Coppee, the French cement company, denied it was
interested in CBR. Analysts believe other likely candidates include
Holderbank of Switzerland, and Heidelberger Zement of Germany.

LIBYAN Arab Airlines is negotiating to buy 25 aircraft from Airbus

said yesterday, Reuter reports from Tunis.
Representatives of the two companies, meeting in Tripoli for the second
successive day, agreed on the types of aircraft and delivery dates, it said.
Airbus might also take part in what Jana called 'a joint investment
programme to set up maintenance hangars, auxiliary workshops and flight
simulators as a technical service centre for this type of aircraft in North
Africa and the Middle East'.
International flights to and from Libya have been banned by UN resolution
since April last year following alleged Libyan involvement in the blowing up
of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.

<TEXT>
MEDICAL school applications in the US reached a record high this year,
despite the uncertain effects healthcare reform will have on the lives of
doctors. 'It has made sure that people are doing it for other reasons than
to make a lot of money,' said Mr Brian Nelson, a medical student at the
George Washington University School of Medicine.
With the University of California, San Francisco, receiving 5,100
applications last year for 140 medical school places, other reasons are
clearly abundant. The attraction may be job security.
The push towards 'managed care', whereby doctors would form networks to
compete for business, is likely to reduce salaries. At the same time the
Clinton administration hopes to increase the number of students entering
general medicine to 50 per cent within five years. In 1992 just 15 per cent
of medical students chose primary care specialties, with salary
differentials the main reason for the low take-up.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Norway banker foresees krone link to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S central bank governor Hermod Skaanland said he believed Norway
would in some way or other link the krone to a future European currency
system even if Norway did not become a member of the European Community.
'Should we not become a member, I think we will nevertheless seek a currency
regime which in some way or other is tied to the European system and on a
basis as mutual as circumstances will permit,' Mr Skaanland told delegates
of the annual meeting of the Federation Internationale des Bourse de
Valeurs.
Norway unilaterally linked the krone to the European currency unit in
October 1990, but was forced to float the domestic currency last December
during turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism which also forced
neighbouring Sweden and Finland to float their currencies.
After an immediate fall of about 6 per cent in the krone's value against the
Ecu, it has returned to about 3.5-4 per cent below its pre-float level.
'A unilateral link to the Ecu of the kind we had up to December last year
does not appear a very promising alternative. Something more robust is
needed,' Mr Skaanland said without giving details.
Norway is currently negotiating membership of the EC but polls put
opposition to accession at about 58 per cent with just 31 per cent in
favour.
The issue will be decided by a referendum, possibly in 1995.
'As a member, Norway would be fully prepared to participate in the foreign
exchange co-operation within the European Community which may at that point
in time exist.
'In the meantime, I suppose we will continue to await the course of events
without any major change in our exchange rate policy,' he said.

FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Steel active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A broker's recommendation and profits upgrade for British Steel made it the
day's most actively traded stock as turnover soared to 20m and the shares
improved 2 to 114 1/2 p. The stock was also heavily traded in the traded
options sector, with the equivalent of a further 6.3m shares dealt.
Maintaining its current year estimate at Pounds 70m, BZW lifted its
prediction for the year to March 1995 by Pounds 50m to Pounds 250m. The
securities house said the revised forecast is based on current steel prices
excluding the September 1993 price initiative. It added that a further 5 per
cent increase in steel prices would lead to a raising of its estimate to
Pounds 450m.
Urging investors to buy the shares, the engineering team at BZW said: 'Now
that the European steel restructuring plan appears to be achieving its
objective, the focus of attention will shift to the fundamentals surrounding
British Steel's valuation.'
The demand for British Steel also boosted sentiment in ASW Holdings, which
moved forward 12 to 208p.
Bathroom manufacturer Spring Ram was one of the best performers in the
London market yesterday. In spite of announcing boardroom resignations -
including the departure of Mr Bill Rooney, the founder and chief executive -
and a loss of Pounds 36.4m for the first half, Spring Ram forged ahead 7 1/2
to 68p. The market felt that the risks to the company had been minimised
following the shake-out by the new chairman.
Pharmaceuticals group UniChem climbed 6 to 247p after announcing a rise in
half-year profits to Pounds 17.99m from a previous Pounds 12.56m.
Vodafone hardened 2 to 494p after the group introduced a new tariff to its
MetroDigital service, enabling calls to be made more cheaply from a
specified location. Cable and Wireless, which owns Vodafone's competitor
Mercury Communications, shed 2 to 853p. Mercury is already offering free
off-peak local calls through its one-2-one digital mobile phone venture.
The market was cheered by bumper profits from Next. The shares firmed 4 1/2
to 208 1/2 p as several brokers upgraded full year profits expectations.
They included BZW, which raised its forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 70m.
However, one analyst said: 'I think the share price rise was muted because
of worries about future growth given that productivity levels are already so
high.'
Sears firmed 3 to 118p ahead of interim figures due for release next
Tuesday.
Some brewers were affected by concern over a potential US tax on alcohol
alongside possible tobacco taxes. Grand Metropolitan fell 7 to 414p, and
Guinness eased a penny to 459p ahead of first-half figures expected today.
Northern Foods succumbed to cautious comments from analysts on a two-day
visit to the company. Several were reported to have been examining their
figures with a view to downgrading profits expectations. The shares
retreated 9 to 257p in volume of 3.6m.
Food retailers remained under a cloud following Tesco's disappointing
figures on Tuesday. Tesco shares eased 3 to 209p as further comment on its
decline in margins was made, while J. Sainsbury lost 10 to 440p in sympathy.
Dealers were more positive about Wm Morrison Supermarkets ahead of today's
interim figures and the shares appreciated 5 to 129p.
Media-based conglomerate Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, climbed 12
to 528p as SG Warburg reiterated its buy recommendation.
Thorn EMI slipped after a US newspaper article talked of difficulties at
Thorn's Rent-A-Center business in the US. The shares fell 23 to 965p in
early trading as copies of the article were circulated in London.
Nerves steadied later and the stock rallied to close a net 11 off at 977p,
following above-average volume of 3.2m. Earlier this month, investors were
unsettled by news of the disappointing performance in the group's defence
business.
Shares in GKN shed 3 to 492p after NatWest Securities trimmed its current
year profits forecast. The securities house reduced its estimate by Pounds
5m to Pounds 110m to take account of difficult trading conditions at United
Engineering Steels, in which it has a 39 per cent stake. Dealers were also
concerned that there had been no confirmation of an order from Saudi Arabia
for around 200 Piranha armoured vehicles that has been widely reported.
Belief that September car sales in the UK might be lower than predicted
weakened several motor stocks. Casualties included Lex Service, down 7 to
399p, T Cowie 3 to 243p, and Pendragon 5 to 265p.
Engineering group Spirax-Sarco fell 10 to 362p, after a cautious results
meeting. Interim profits improved from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.4m in line
with market expectations and one researcher said: 'it remains one of the
best quality stocks in the capital goods sector.'
A broker's visit to the materials technology arm of Johnson Matthey to see
the benefits of recent restructuring helped the shares rise 4 to 460p.

A cut in profits forecasts by a UK securities house for BOC Group led to
weakness in the share price, which receded 6 to 636p.
Smith New Court reduced profits expectation to Pounds 335m from Pounds 340m

The figures showed July sales were down 58 per cent from the previous year.
Mr Philip Morrish of Smith said: 'BOC's hopes of holding on to 50 per cent

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty created by President Boris Yeltsin's dissolution of the Russian
parliament was ultimately responsible for sending leading oil shares higher
in early trading. However, the market took a phlegmatic view of potential
eastern European chaos and most of the gains were reversed.
The initial view that political turmoil would restrict oil supplies forced
the price of Brent crude higher. Oil shares were bought in the US and the
subsequent shortage of stock in London led to a squeeze.
However, Brent fell back and the shortage was filled. Also, Lehman Brothers,
the US investment house, officially released downgrades relating to a sector
review last Friday. The house shifted BP to a sell from neutral and Shell
Transport to neutral from buy. BP, which had been up 5, closed 1 1/2 ahead
at 302 1/2 p and Shell lost an earlier gain of 5 to end a net penny down at
638p.

FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Clinton news awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUG STOCKS provided the principal support for the London market yesterday.
They bounced higher on the eve of publication of President Clinton's health
reform plan, reflecting the view that it is 'worse to travel than to
arrive'. They were also helped by a stronger US dollar.
The health reforms were originally set to be published in May and continual
delays have given opportunities for endless rumours and scare stories. An
analyst said that since the package was leaked to the Wall Street Journal 10
days ago, 150 more changes had been introduced. It could be 1995 before any
final version is enacted.
One analyst said drug stocks could now benefit as the focus of criticism
shifted to other areas, such as North American Free Trade. However,
international traders, surprised at a rush of late buying, said most
investors now held the stocks, reforms were unlikely to add to the wealth of
pre-release information, and there could be a period of consolidation.
Glaxo rose 11 to 641p and Wellcome added 6 at 718p. SmithKline Beecham was
further helped by talk that a decision had been made not to withdraw
SmithKline Units from the FT-SE 100 Index as proposed. Although the London
Stock Exchange said nothing would be decided until the FT-SE Actuaries
Indices Steering Committee met on October 6, SmithKline 'A' shares advanced
18 to 425p and the Units 19 to 383p.
UK tobacco companies traded lower on speculation that a 'sin tax' included
in the Clinton health plan could hit cigarettes harder than expected.
Rothmans International lost 9 to 649p and BAT Industries 2 to 462p on
reports that US congress members now expect a tax of Dollars 1 a pack,
against earlier tax forecasts of 50 to 75 cents a packet.

FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: UK follows rallies in Europe and US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market stood up bravely yesterday to the disturbing
political developments reported from Russia overnight. While not
underestimating the potential seriousness of the situation, UK investors
took heart from the rallies in other European markets and the FT-SE 100
Index, down 26.6 in early trading, finished nearly six points higher on the
day, comfortably regaining the 3,000 mark.
Even the initial setback of around 0.9 per cent in London was less than
suffered elsewhere in Europe, and considerably less than the fall in UK
stocks at the time of the abortive anti-Gorbachev coup. Little selling was
reported and a good lead from stock index futures soon brought bargain
hunters into the stock market.
Firmness in the dollar helped US-influenced blue chips, with the
pharmaceutical sector standing out well while awaiting formal publication of
President Clinton's health care proposals.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 up 5.9 at 3,007.5. Equities had
opened lower as London digested the news from Russia and the subsequent
38-point fall in the Dow Industrial Average and 292-point setback in the
Nikkei average.
Within one hour of the official opening, the Footsie was down to 2,975, some
4.5 per cent below the trading peak reached at the end of last month. Had
the market continued to fall, equity strategists would have been looking
hard at the next support levels, believed to be in the Footsie 2,960 area.
However, the mood changed as Europe became more optimistic ahead of the
opening of the new session on Wall Street. Led by a good premium on the
December stock index contract, UK equities regained confidence, although
gains were restrained at first as some UK houses sold equities against their
holdings in the stock index futures.
The market moved upwards steadily, helped by early firmness in New York.
When London closed for the day, the Dow Average was showing a 4.75 gain.
'Expect a recovery in share prices unless there is a civil war (in Russia),'
commented the European equity team at Goldman Sachs. A civil war, which the
analysts regard as unlikely, would mean a 5 to 10 per cent decline, with
Germany suffering most. However, the Goldman team accepts that other
outcomes to the Russian situation are possible.
The success of the UK market in again holding to the Footsie 3,000 benchmark
raised hopes that, barring serious developments in eastern Europe, London
share prices may have seen the worst of the September shakeout.
Yesterday's performance from equities was all the more positive because
corporate trading news, still a major concern for investors, remained
somewhat inconclusive. Spring Ram, a house-fitting group which had been a
market favourite, closed firmly in spite of disclosure of dismal trading
figures and the dismissal of some directors and City advisers.
With second-line issues somewhat brushed aside yesterday, the FT-SE Mid 250
Index dipped 1.5 to 3,427.5. Seaq volume picked up late in the session to
reach a total of 670.7m shares, compared with 538.4m on Tuesday, when
retail, or customer, business revived strongly to record a value of Pounds
1.13bn.

FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING volume in stock index futures nearly doubled in London yesterday as
investors reacted to the setbacks in New York and Tokyo caused by the
political crisis in Russia, writes Terry Byland.
The December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index traded for most of the day at a
discount to fair value, but early losses were quickly recovered and the
market closed on a steadier note.
The initial loss was not large but, although few sellers appeared either in
equities or futures, December fell to 2,988, driving the underlying stock
market down.
The recovery then began and by midsession the December contract stood at the
day's peak of 3,030, a premium of 28 to cash but only around 4 points above
fair value. The future topped off as Wall Street failed to hold all of its
early gain, and December closed at 3,026, a 20-point premium to cash but
lagging behind the fair value premium of around 24 points. Turnover jumped
to 15,230 contracts from Tuesday's 8,929.
Business in traded options also rose sharply, to 42,110 bargains from
23,186. In the FT-SE 100 option, volume rose to 14,753 lots. Individual
stock options were headed by British Steel (6,307) as a UK securities house
rerated the stock. Also active was the Euro FT-SE option (4,436). Awaiting
President Clinton's healthcare proposals, Glaxo traded 1,833 contracts.

FT  23 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Performance varies in emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were wide swings last week in the world's emerging markets, ranging
from another strong gain in dollar terms in Turkey to a sharp fall in
Portugal.
Elsewhere among the indices compiled by the IFC, the private sector arm of
the World Bank, significant positive movements were recorded in Jordan,
Brazil, the Philippines and India, while other declining markets included
Mexico, Colombia and Greece.
In Asia, Pakistan has seen a subdued performance recently ahead of the
general elections next month. BMA Capital Management in Karachi commented
that last week's performance was supported by favourable August trade data,
which showed an increase in exports to Dollars 538m from July's Dollars
451m. The brokerage also noted that the market is now likely to remain
subdued until the elections on October 6.
Among Latin American markets, Mexico suffered a setback as Nafta worries
unsettled investors. The market drifted lower during the week as the
realisation took hold that Nafta faces a difficult passage through the US
congress, particularly as Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, said
he would vote against the deal. The market was moderately firmer yesterday
amid speculative buying.
Baring Securities also noted further privatisation developments, with the
award of two more port concessions: 'Between 1993 and 1994 total investment
in ports is expected to reach Dollars 700m, most of which will be spent in
the construction and improvement of terminals.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow picks up as Russian
worries abate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices finished higher across the board, with secondary stocks
particularly firm, after worries about political unrest in Russia abated,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.78 at 3,547.02. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 3.25 to 456.20, while the
American SE composite finished 3.20 higher at 450.29 and the Nasdaq
composite 11.98 stronger at 745.54. Trading volume on the New York SE
totalled 289m shares.
Prices rebounded from Tuesday's big losses as soon as the opening bell
sounded. The early gains - the Dow rallied 15 points in the first 30 minutes
 -were partly a natural reaction to the sell-off the day before, and partly
a response to the news of the latest developments from Russia.
The market's biggest fear, that the military would intervene to oppose
President Boris Yeltsin and plunge the country into civil war, was not
realised, and the widespread support for Mr Yeltsin among western nations
reassured investors. The situation in Russia, however, remained uncertain,
and continued to cast a shadow over trading in New York.
Domestic considerations were also influencing market sentiment yesterday.
President Bill Clinton was due to officially present his health care plan to
the nation last night, and the drugs sector remained under pressure ahead of
the speech.
Among the biggest pharmaceutical stocks, Pfizer slipped Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 60 1/2 , Bristol Myers-Squibb Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 and
Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 , but Merck firmed Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 .
Primerica moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/2 in volume of 2.4m
shares and Travelers edged Dollars  5/8 higher to Dollars 36 5/8 in turnover
of 2.6m on news that Primerica, which already owns 27 per cent of Travelers,
is negotiating a possible stock-swap merger with the insurance group.
Paramount Communications remained very active, advancing Dollars 1 to
Dollars 78 in volume of 4.37m shares as investors and traders continued to
speculate about the takeover battle that has engulfed Paramount between
Viacom, which has made an Dollars 8.2bn bid to buy the entertainment group,
and QVC, which has offered Dollars 9.5bn for Paramount.
QVC, quoted on the Nasdaq market, was in strong demand, climbing Dollars 3
7/8 to Dollars 60 in heavy dealings, while Viacom, traded on the American
Stock Exchange, rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 .
Optimism about the outlook for third-quarter earnings boosted semiconductor
stocks. Texas Instruments jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 77 3/4 , Motorola
added Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 94 3/4 , National Semiconductor firmed
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 and Intel, on the Nasdaq market, strengthened
Dollars 2 to Dollars 67 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO ended mixed after active turnover. The TSE 300 index gained a net
17.6 at 3,954.9, after trading in negative territory for much of the day,
but falls still led rises at the close by 394 to 321. Volume was 61.2m
shares.
Eleven of the 14 stock groups rose, but gold shares gave back much of
Tuesday's rise, falling 2.22 per cent as the New York spot bullion price
retreated USDollars 8.50 an ounce on indications that the Russian political
crisis had stabilised.

FT  23 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses stage partial recovery
after early fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley expected the new Russian political battle to
produce further strength in the dollar, and weakness in western European
equity markets - 'the further east, the greater the risk.'
So it turned out, initially, with the Eurotrack 100 index opening close to
its low for the day, a little more than 1 per cent down, and the
early-closing Vienna bourse registering a 2.8 per cent decline, writes Our
Markets Staff.
However, by yesterday, Goldman Sachs was saying that, although a Russian
civil war would lead to a 5-10 per cent decline in European share prices,
the absence of strife (more likely) would bring recovery. Supported by an
early upswing in New York, the Eurotrack reacted accordingly.
FRANKFURT, which had looked a little flighty on Monday and Tuesday,
sustained more than the average setback before lunch, and managed less than
the median recovery in the afternoon.
The DAX index fell 32.85, or 1.7 per cent to 1,893.00 over the official
session; in the post-bourse the Ibis-indicated DAX put on only 6.77 to
1,899.77.
Turnover fell from DM8.4bn to DM7.5bn. Banks, closely linked in investors's
minds to Russia and the risk of bad debts, all fell by more than 2 per cent;
Commerzbank, traditionally seen as the least well-provisioned against bad
debts, fell DMDM7.70, or 2.5 per cent to DM304.80.
Mr Nigel Longley, an institutional adviser with Commerzbank, said that
yesterday's decline in the broad market was more a matter of marking shares
down than actual profit-taking. However, there was still room for special
situations. AEG, the Daimler subsidiary dismissed as a break-up situation by
the German news weekly, Der Spiegel, over the weekend, fell another DM3.50
to DM150 for a drop of DM16.20, or nearly 10 per cent over the past five
trading days.
PARIS, which had fallen some 1.4 per cent at the opening, recouped a
significant percentage of the losses by the close. The CAC-40 index finished
off 14.43 or 0.7 per cent at 2,079.96, after an intraday low of 2,059.63 and
a high of 2,088.98.
Turnover was strong at FFr4.2bn. In a generally weaker market overall
Carrefour, the food retailer, went against the trend with a rise of FFr67 or
2 per cent to FFr3,350 following positive brokers' recommendations based on
the group's long term outlook.
The mood elsewhere was less bright although Havas gained FFr9.6 to FFr483 on
reports that a magazine article, due to be published today, would reveal
further information about a proposed share swap deal with Canal Plus, down
FFr2 at FFr1,205.
Lafarge Coppee settled off FFr5 at FFr405 after reports, later denied by the
construction materials group, that it might have been interested in making a
bid for CBR, the Belgian cement manufacturer.
LVMH shed FFr41 to FFr4,092 ahead of today's announcement of interim results
which are expected to show a substantial fall, while Ciments Francais was
down FFr5 at FFr165 ahead of first half results which came after the close.
AMSTERDAM recovered from an early fall with support from the heavily traded
international stocks. The CBS Tendency index ended down 0.9 at 123.6 in
turnover reported as moderate.
Among the internationals, Royal Dutch gained 30 cents to Fl 178.30, Unilever
lost 60 cents to Fl 200 and Heineken fell Fl 1.40 to Fl 181.60.
ZURICH finished easier, but above early lows as investors returned to the
market after an early round of profit-taking. The SMI index shed 17.2 to
2,414.6 after an intra-day low of 2,397.4.
Mr Mirko Sangiorgio of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich said that while overnight
political developments had a depressing impact early in the day, investors
quickly resumed buying.
Banks were easier with UBS SFr11 lower at SFr1,187 and CS Holding SFr25
lower at SFr2,870. Large sell orders left Swissair SFr17 lower at SFr723
after a local press report that shareholders were unlikely to approve the
company's planned Alcazar alliance with three other European airlines under
the terms proposed.
Against the trend, Schindler bearers added SFr100 to SFr5,800 as the company
announced plans for a new generation of lift systems.
MILAN's decline was eased by a strong Olivetti performance as the Comit
index shed 7.6, or 1.3 per cent to 589.94.
Strong foreign demand late in the day took Olivetti L49 or 2.5 per cent
higher to L1,974. Analysts, who noted that the company was expected to
report further losses shortly, attributed the rise to the company's hopes of
breaking into Italy's buoyant mobile telecommunications market.
Gemina, the financial holding company, put on L28 to L1,490 in response to
its announcement of higher full year figures on Tuesday.
Sme rose L38 to L4,170 as the supermarket and restaurant chain said that
revenues rose 6 per cent in the first eight months of the year.
MADRID, a late closer, came out with one of the day's bigger declines, the
general index losing 3.64, or 1.3 per cent at 283.90. Turnover rose from
Pta17.8bn to Pta22.5bn.
Mr Jose Manuel Arroyo, director of equities at Asesores Bursatiles in
Madrid, said that the market was taking profits yesterday, especially in
banks; he added that Madrid's above average fall was its usual reaction to
dramatic events, as a small market susceptible to global investment
decisions.
STOCKHOLM was supported by a firmer local currency and further falls in
domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 18.0 to
1,263.4 in turnover up from SKr1.1bn to SKr1.3bn.
Ericsson, in telecommunications, and Astra in pharmaceuticals led the
market's rise, the former's B shares gaining SKr8 to SKr418 and the latter's
up SKr4 at SKr161.
VIENNA's traders and analysts said they expected market uncertainty to
continue until there are clear signs of one side coming out on top in the
Russian power struggle. The ATX index closed 27.01 down at 949.79.
ISTANBUL gained ground in late trading after the KOI, the organisation
responsible for privatisations, announced that Kalkinma Bankasi, the state
bank, could only sell its 5.4 per cent stake in Ergeli, the steel group,
with its consent.
The composite index finished up 295.3 at 14,483.9.

<TEXT>
CONCERN about the political situation in Russia held investors back in Tokyo
and stock prices ended broadly lower, awaiting reaction in the European
markets, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The 225-share Nikkei average fell 292.03, or 1.43 per cent, to 20,174.62,
more than erasing Tuesday's 200-point gain prompted by the Bank of Japan's
bigger than expected 0.75 percentage point discount rate cut. The index
registered a high for the day of 20,380.74 and a low of 20,112.11.
Volume was estimated at 300m shares, compared with 349.9m the previous day,
and declining issues outnumbered advances by 959 to 115, with 111 stocks
unchanged.
The broader first section Topix index was down 21.68, or 1.31 per cent, at
1,628.12, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.64 to 1,251.68.
News of the Russian political crisis had sent Nikkei futures prices falling
in Chicago, laying the ground for a weaker Tokyo opening. The market was
also hit by selling from arbitrage unwinding.
After falling throughout the morning, the market was reluctant to move in
afternoon trade, in the absence of much foreign demand.
However, some buying by trust funds gave some stability at the lower levels
and helped the Nikkei to tread water above the 20,000 mark.
The decline was broadly based with no sectors advancing. High-tech shares
were heavily traded. NEC retreated Y10 to Y935, Fujitsu Y9 to Y793 and Oki
Electric Industry Y17 to Y520. Toshiba was an exception, moving ahead Y16 to
Y698, boosted by some buying by foreign brokerages.
Banking issues weakened across the board. The Industrial Bank of Japan
receded Y70 to Y3,290, Nippon Credit Bank Y60 to Y6,010 and Sumitomo Bank
Y70 to Y2,180.
Among easier steel shares, Nippon Steel slipped Y2 to Y329 and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Y8 to Y680.
Roundup
WITH ONE or two markets oblivious to problems elsewhere in the world, the
region's equity markets fell by an average of less than 0.5 per cent on the
day.
BANGKOK offered the biggest response as bad news below 1,000 on the SET
index was interpreted as a sell signal, the index falling by 14.83, or 1.5
per cent, to 977.75 in turnover of Bt7.46bn.
SINGAPORE recouped half of a 2.4 per cent intraday fall to end with the
Straits Times Industrial index 25.77 down at 1,969.97. Volume amounted to
403.87m shares.
CarnaudMetalbox dropped SDollars 1.90 to SDollars 9.80 on worse than
expected interim earnings.
MANILA mirrored New York's overnight decline on Russia's political turmoil,
the composite index closing 18.28 lower at 1,921.43 in combined turnover up
from 626.44m pesos to 672.46m pesos.
HONG KONG and AUSTRALIA, hosting the biggest equity markets on the Pacific
Rim outside Japan, did little in aggregate terms, the Hang Seng index
shedding 16.41 to 7,478.90 in HKDollars 2.64bn turnover and the All
Ordinaries losing 5.9 at 1,919.3, after an opening 1,927.5, in ADollars
463.8m trade.
In the former, investors were looking to the vote tomorrow on Beijing's bid
to host the 2000 Olympics. The result, it was estimated, could move the Hang
Seng index by 200 to 300 points either way. In the latter, a strong golds
sector offset big falls elsewhere.
Winners on the day included KARACHI and SEOUL. Pakistani stocks saw fresh
buying in the energy sector after the government announced plans to
privatise the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC), and the KSE index
climbed 13.75 to 1,327.11.
Seoul survived late institutional selling to finish with the composite index
a token 2.90 ahead at 697.56.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Volatility in futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN interest rate futures had a volatile day yesterday as dealers tried
to track the changing political situation in Russia, writes James Blitz.
At the start of the day, short-term interest rate markets lost a little
ground in the wake of a downturn in bond prices. The December Euromark
contract declined one basis point to 93.88 and Dec-ember sterling lost the
same amount to 94.28.
But as signs grew that chaos was not taking place in Moscow, these markets
rallied.
They may also have gained from the 'flight into quality' that tends to
accompany any uncertainty: dealers often move assets down to the short end
of the money market curve in times of change so as to be able to respond
immediately to any new situation.
The December Euromark contract closed a net 2 basis points higher at 93.91,
while December short sterling ended at 93.32, up 3 basis points on balance.
December French francs finished 4 basis points ahead on the day at 93.67.
In the German cash market, the Bundesbank helped to ease conditions by
adding some DM5.2bn of liquidity. However, this did not bring call money any
lower than 6.85 per cent, still some 15 basis points above the established
repo rate.
Dealers are not expecting any cut in the discount rate at today's Bundesbank
council meeting, which is due to be Mr Helmut Schlesinger's last as
president of the central bank.
The Bundesbank said there would be no press conference after today's
meeting, although its ability to take the market by surprise can never be
underestimated.
In sterling markets, there was little change to interest rates along the
curve.
Three-month money again closed at 5 7/8 per cent, with the bid rate at 5
15/16 per cent and the offered side showing 5 13/16 per cent.
There were difficulties removing the Bank of England's shortage, which was
forecast at the start of trading at Pounds 1.2bn. The Bank did not operate
in the early round, and a mere Pounds 11m was removed before lunchtime.
In the afternoon, only Pounds 590m was removed and there was late assistance
of Pounds 570m, which could be rolled over today. The overnight cost of
borrowing sterling peaked at 7 1/2 per cent.
As one London dealer said: 'Trying to forecast the overnight in sterling
these days is like trying to forecast the British weather.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops on Russian calm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday gave up much of the ground it had won against the
D-Mark in the immediate aftermath of the Russian crisis, as dealers took the
view that events in Moscow would not unsettle western nations or financial
markets, writes James Blitz.
The immediate market response to President Yeltsin's announcement on Tuesday
that he was suspending parliament and ruling by direct decree was to push
the dollar higher as a safe haven currency. It peaked at DM1.6475 against a
D-Mark which was weak against most European currencies as well.
But the dollar buying reversed yesterday. Dealers may have been becalmed by
the absence of blood on the streets of Moscow, and by signs that army
leaders were firmly backing Mr Yeltsin, rather than splitting into different
factions.
Some dealers appeared concerned that the crisis could flare up at any moment
with severe consequences for the west. But one London dealer wondered
whether events in Russia, even if they exploded into civil war, would have
any long-term impact on Europe and the US. As he put it, if a little
crudely: 'The complete collapse of the Russian economy has taken place and
has been priced into the market. It is hard to see how things could get a
whole lot worse.'
The fall in the dollar may also have been due to profit-taking by calmer
heads in the market. The US currency closed at DM1.6285 in London. It
finished in New York at DM1.6300, after Tuesday's DM1.6385 close.
The French franc was confined to narrow range trading, ending at FFr3.483
from a previous FFr3.487. Sterling closed firmer against the D-Mark at
DM2.4750, up from DM2.4675.
The Finnish markka and the Swedish krona were more seriously hit because of
their countries' trade links with the region. They fell to lows of FM3.6300
and SKr5.0504 per D-Mark but later recovered.
Mr Stephen King, international economist at James Capel in London, believes
the Russian events are unlikely to have a long term impact. He recalls that
even the surge in the dollar that accompanied President Gorbachev's
temporary ousting on August 19, 1991, was short-lived. The US currency was
at DM1.75 at the start of that month, peaked at DM1.81 and settled back to
DM1.74 by the beginning of September.
But he also thinks that, if elections are scheduled to be held in December
in Russia, the uncertainty could give the dollar a better tone. 'In that
situation, dealers could be more inclined to look at developments that are
positive for the dollar, such as declining German interest rates,' he said.
Dollar/yen trading was sidelined. The Japanese currency had weakened to
around Y107.50 against the dollar on the Russian events, but later
appreciated to finish at Y106.45.

<TEXT>
The London Commodity Exchange's robusta COFFEE market recouped most of its
early losses yesterday as New York prices recovered from Tuesday night's
sharp sell-off. The rally, from a low of Dollars 1,225 a tonne for the
November futures position, was encouraged by confirmation that Brazilian
financing for its role in the producer retention scheme was in place.
Rumours of problems concerning financing, technical liquidation and a
stronger dollar after news of the power struggle in Russia had all pushed US
prices lower on Tuesday evening. At the close London's November price stood
at Dollars 1,270 a tonne, Dollars 2 down on balance. LCE COCOA prices went
from strength to strength in the morning as the market, supported by a
weaker sterling, seemed content to resume the uptrend after Tuesday's
downward correction. In the afternoon the December contract pushed to a new
second position peak of Pounds 936 a tonne, the highest since June 1990 when
the market reached Pounds 949, the next technical target. 'People are taking
insurance against the market going up further. So many have run short for
such a long time,' one trader said.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers meet to
finalise export pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of about 40 of the world's leading coffee producer nations
are meeting today and tomorrow in Brasilia to finalise an agreement to
retain stocks as a move to boost prices.
Between them the countries represent about 90 per cent of world exports.
Scheduled to take effect in October, the scheme they have agreed upon
envisages the retention of 20 per cent of each country's exports until the
price of coffee reaches 75 US cents a lb; 10 per cent will be retained until
the price hits 80 cents. Above that level, there will be no retention.
Each country will be responsible for implementing its own retention plan.
The world's most important coffee producer, Brazil, intends to cover
exporters' costs by purchasing stocks ear-marked for retention. It will pay
them 80 per cent of face value, deducting taxes and estimated profits,
calculated at a combined 20 per cent of the sale price, says Mr Gilson
Ximenes, director of the National Coffee Department of the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce.
Concerns about the ability of the financially troubled Brazilian government
to meet these obligations have been played down by Mr Jose Eduardo de
Andrade Vieira, minister of industry and commerce.
Producers have already agreed to establish a new organisation called the
Association of Coffee Producing Nations, with headquarters in Brasilia. It
will monitor the retention programmes of individual countries, with the
assistance of an independent auditor.
Germany will sign the new international cocoa agreement aimed at
strengthening international co-operation and stabilising the markets on
October 1, the agriculture ministry said yesterday, reports Reuter from
Bonn.
The new agreement, hammered out by producer and consumer members of the
International Cocoa Organisation earlier this month and based on a
production management policy, is scheduled to come into effect on that date.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wind of change hits Cuban
agriculture - This year's storms have brought tentative reform in their wake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CUBAN government is reorganising its agriculture in an effort to lift
production of domestic crops and end chronic shortages, as well as to
strengthen the weakened sugar sector, on which the island's economy is
heavily dependent.
Cuban agriculture has been hit hard by a reduction in the availability of
inputs because the economy is strapped for hard currency to finance imports.
This has been compounded by two bouts of bad weather earlier this year that
led to flooded fields and heavy crop losses.
The government's new strategy is based on allowing increased private
participation in agriculture, with the establishment of new co-operative and
individually-run farms. But these will still operate within the framework of
a centrally-controlled economy.
It has also announced that the impending sugar harvest will start earlier
than normal, and will be shortened, to allow cane farms more time to plant
for future harvests, and to give the industry a chance to recover from the
lack of chemicals and machinery and the effects of the bad weather.
A freak storm in March, which brought high winds and heavy rain, flattened
and flooded thousands of acres of canes and reduced the sugar content of the
plants that could be reaped. It also destroyed and blocked roads in farming
areas and damaged several of the country's 157 sugar mills.
Cuba's citrus industry also suffered, as did potato and fruit growers. The
cost of the storms to the economy, including damage to roads, buildings and
agriculture, was put by international aid agencies at between USDollars 1bn
and Dollars 1.5bn. In early June the island's agriculture was again hit by
heavy rains brought by a tropical depression.
In the wake of shortages of locally-produced food caused by the bad weather,
the Cuban government has said it will give some degree of administrative and
financial independence to the new co-operative and individual farmers, who
are being given state-owned land.
The intention, said the government, was to increase the output of a range of
agricultural products, including sugar, by giving farm workers an incentive
to produce. Their earnings will be determined by the productivity of the
co-operatives.
The new co-operative farms will continue to be supervised by the state while
exercising autonomy in day-to-day management. They will work the land for an
indefinite period, will own and dispose of what they produce, and will have
their own bank accounts.
The changes, which the government says are 'innovative', are coming seven
years after the sudden termination of another programme to encourage private
farming and marketing of domestic food crops. The government said then that
some private peasant farmers and distributors had become corrupt and too
rich at the expense of consumers.
This year's bad weather compounded already serious problems for the sugar
industry. Mills had been running about 25 per cent behind target at the end
of February, mainly because of the government's inability to import adequate
fuel and replacement parts. Cane production and milling had also been set
back by shortages of chemicals such as fertilisers and pesticides, and
spares and fuel for harvesters, trucks and tractors.
The faltering economy has been dealt a body blow by the failure of this
year's harvest. Production was 4.15m tonnes, 40 per cent less than last year
and half the level reached in better years. The government was forced to
cancel shipments to some buyers, further reducing foreign earnings.
The government is basing its plans for a recovery on growing more cane, and
is apparently expecting another poor harvest next year. Mr Nelson Torres,
the sugar minister, has said the next harvest will begin and end early,
making way for increased cultivation 'in order to have a much greater volume
of cane for the next harvests'.
The minister has exhorted workers in the sugar industry to be more
efficient, and said the government was hoping that the next harvest would be
bigger than the last. Analysts have said that the volume of cane that Cuba
will produce for the next harvest, and the state of the mills, indicated
higher output next year, but not more than 5.2m tonnes.

currency rates until the next farm council on October 20, writes Alison
Maitland.
The Food and Drink Federation, which complained about the September 9 freeze
to Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, said it was disappointed
with the decision to continue it.
'We're very apprehensive about what the commission might propose at the
October council, particularly if it involves any extension of the switchover
mechanism,' said Ms Helen Williams, EC and international policy executive.
'There are agrimonetary rules that are up and running and we don't see why
there's a need to change them the first time that German and Dutch farmers
are faced with a cut in their support prices.'
Mr Paul Williamson, external affairs director for Cadbury Schweppes and
president of Caobisco, the European chocolate, biscuit and cake association,
said the continued freeze meant even more uncertainty for manufacturers.
Since the start of the year, 'green' currency rates had tracked real
exchange rates and companies had been able to hedge against changes in
currency. The freeze left them unable to protect themselves.
'Prices should be varying,' he said 'That's what we planned for and if
you've taken protection against that then you're faced with a risk now.'
Mr John Bradbury, group buying director for United Biscuits, said: 'The best
thing of all would be if we could all get agreement to price everything in
Ecus. I optimistically carry five Ecus around in my pocket'.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC postpones 'green' currency
changes

THE EUROPEAN Commission has postponed for a month changes in the European
Community's complex 'green money' system for translating farm price supports
into national currencies.
But Brussels is under strong pressure from Germany to re-link common
agricultural policy prices to a rising D-Mark, a move that would bust an
already-strained farm budget and complicate delicate negotiations within the
Uruguay Round trade talks, where France is threatening to veto the farm
chapter.
After inconclusive talks on Tuesday night, the Commission told EC farm
ministers it would bring proposals on the agri-monetary problem to the next
Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on October 20.
The root of the problem is Germany's desire to protect its farmers from
losing income as a result of the D-Mark revaluation against other EC
currencies, in the wake of the August 2 decision to float all currencies
within 15 per cent fluctuation bands of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Until August 2 every ERM realignment pushed up every member state's farm
prices to follow the movement of the strongest currencies, invariably the
D-mark but also often the Dutch guilder. This so-called 'switchover'
mechanism to protect German farmers is now in abeyance because the wide
bands make formal ERM realignment near impossible.
But the ERM chaos from last September to August 2 had already meant an extra
charge to the farm budget of Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.15bn) as a result of
'switchover'.
Since August 2, the Commission had been adjusting national farm prices every
three trading days, leading to several revaluations of the 'green' French
franc and Danish krone - at the expense of German and Dutch farmers. Ten
days ago, however, Brussels froze any further changes, partly as a sop to
Germany, which had demanded a special meeting of the Council of Ministers to
address the issue. That freeze will now remain in force until October 20.
'We've had a lot of pressure from the Germans in the past few weeks,' a
senior British agriculture negotiator acknowledged.
As things stand, the Commission maintains that restoring 'switchover' would
add a further Ecu1.42bn to farm spending. Its own proposals, for
compensating farmers affected by currency appreciation, would cost Ecu870m
for each 1 per cent revaluation between 1994 and 1998, Brussels estimates.
But this is a sliding scale formula targeted on some national farm prices;
switchover affects all farm prices and locks the spending into the budget
'for ever', as one Commission official put it.
Switchover has led to heavy inflation of the 'green' Ecu, giving it a
D-mark-loaded value 21 per cent over the value of the market Ecu. To weight
the common green currency further in favour of the D-mark would make it
almost impossible to bring farm prices down to world market levels - the
goal of last year's CAP reforms. The consequences within Gatt - if the
Commission caves in to German demands - would be profound.
The French demands for more concessions on farm trade are intended to ensure
that the 21 per cent cut in subsidised food exports agreed in last
November's Blair House agreement between the EC and the US will never have
to be applied. If EC prices reach world level, export subsidies will become
redundant and France and its partners will be able to export what they want,
without any restraint except finding buyers.
The price cuts of nearly one-third agreed under CAP reform make reaching
world price levels a realistic possibility by about 1997 - provided the
Council of Ministers stops chipping away at the reform's mechanisms for
restraining production. But if prices are again hitched to a rising D-Mark,
the effect of those price cuts will be badly eroded and the Blair House 21
per cent curbs on subsidised exports will come into play.
The Commission's best ally in resisting Germany is the need for EC budget
restraint, something Bonn insists on in everything except its own farm
interests. France itself will resist making its lucrative farm exports
hostage to the fortunes of the D-Mark, while the UK is taking a very hard
line on maintaining the farm budget ceiling.
'We recognise that there is a political problem to be solved,' said one
senior UK official, 'but let's face it, we can't solve it by conjuring up
cash which doesn't exist'.

Demand for wool is still holding up very well at auctions in Australia and
New Zealand. Clearances are good, with as much as 97% of the offering at
Sydney sold yesterday, though 90% is more typical. Prices are firm and
occasionally a little dearer, with the AWC market indicator up another 2
cents to 433 cents a kg. on September 22, compared with 428 a week before.
Postponement rather than removal of the Garnaut stockpile disposal threat is
seen as a factor helping to bring about a more active market spell, but
longer term anxieties persist

FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal prices lose Russian
crisis gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALS PRICES reacted only briefly yesterday to the threat that political
turmoil in Russia might affect exports to the the west. After opening
strongly, most prices dropped back when it became clear that consumers were
not panicking and rushing to buy.
Although Russia is a big supplier of aluminium, copper and, especially,
nickel, London Metal Exchange stocks are at present very high and highly
visible.
Gold, which leapt Dollars 10 to Dollars 365.50 a troy ounce in New York
immediately after the news that Russian premier Mr Boris Yeltsin had
dissolved his parliament, closed last night in London less than Dollars 1
ahead of Tuesday's close at Dollars 354.25.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at the T. Hoare and Company financial services
organisation, said she expected gold to 'spend a little more time between
Dollars 348 and Dollars 360 before staging a convincing move into a new
trading range based off Dollars 360, probably by the start of October'. That
would represent the start of the second leg of the bull market. 'This does
not mean rapid appreciation, but a solid, underlying upward trend.'
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at the Ord Minnett financial services group, pointed
out that 'huge western inventories will ensure there is no immediate
consumer concern about base metals availability'. Nevertheless, market
sentiment, at present very depressed, should improve after the events in
Russia. However, there was danger if prices rallied to a point where western
metal producers delayed desperately needed cuts in capacity. 'This is what
happened in the Gulf war and that delayed necessary supply rationalisation
for a year.'
Reuter reported from Moscow that Russian traders, accustomed to political
upheavals, said it would be business as usual during the latest crisis.
Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest producer of that metal, said business
would not be affected and contracts would be honoured.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian diamond discovery
looks very promising
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHP MINERALS of Australia and its Canadian partner, Dia Met Minerals, are
expanding their operations in Canada's Northwest Territories amid growing
indications that they have discovered one of the world's richest diamond
deposits.
The two companies say that they have decided to build a bulk-sampling plant
and a camp capable of housing 110 people on their prospecting claims in the
Lac de Gras area, 310km (190 miles) north-east of Yellowknife.
An underground working area is also under construction at the site to
extract samples from one of two especially promising kimberlite pipes -
kimberlite is the dark, usually blue, soil in which diamonds are found. The
plant will test samples of between 3,500 and 5,000 tonnes from each of the
two pipes.
Investors responded enthusiastically to the latest test results released by
BHP and Dia Met.
Dia Met's share price soared CDollars 6.50 in early trading on the Toronto
stock exchange yesterday to CDollars 53.50 (Pounds 26). Share prices of
other companies involved in the Northwest Territories diamond rush also
climbed sharply.
Analysts at Pacific International Securities of Vancouver said in a report
yesterday that it was confident Canada would become a major diamond
producer, and that the Lac de Gras property would remain in production for
'many decades'.
BHP and Dia Met say that they have discovered a total of 26 kimberlite pipes
in the Lac de Gras area. Based on valuations by diamond specialists in
Antwerp and London, stones discovered in three of the pipes have a value of
between USDollars 81 and Dollars 112 a carat. According to Pacific
International, gem diamonds recovered from the Jwaneng mine in Botswana, the
biggest producer of gem quality diamonds, have an average value of about
Dollars 100 a carat.
One of the Lac de Gras pipes yielded 62.11 carats from a sample of 49.8
tonnes, with 31 per cent of the stones identified as being of gem quality. A
sample of 80.5 tonnes from another pipe yielded 40 diamonds with a diameter
of more than 1mm, among which was one colourless stone measuring more than
2mm.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Accountancy Column: The Dollars 30bn question behind US
'litigation crisis' - Lawrence A. Weinbach warns that opportunistic legal
claims are threatening the future development of the profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAWRENCE A. WEINBACH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH has been written lately about the 'litigation crisis' affecting the
accounting profession. Throughout the world, but particularly in the United
States and the United Kingdom, claims against the profession have risen
dramatically. A staggering Dollars 30bn in claims currently faces the
largest firms in the US alone.
In 1992, the six largest US firms spent Dollars 598m - or 11 per cent of
their revenues - in direct costs fighting such claims. Insurance recoveries
provided an additional Dollars 185m in resolving claims.
The transaction costs themselves are so high that 95 per cent of claims are
settled out of court. As a result of these costs and settlements, the
largest firms have experienced a 300 per cent increase in liability
insurance premiums since 1985. Two out of every five smaller firms are going
without insurance altogether. Over-exposure to litigation was a big factor
in the 1990 bankruptcy of Laventhol &amp; Horwath, then the seventh-largest
accounting firm in the US.
Many feel that accountants have no one to blame but themselves. When a
company collapses shortly after receiving a 'clean' opinion from its
auditors, it is frequently alleged that this indicates the auditors failed
to do their job properly.
Unfortunately, such an assumption mis-states the purpose of an audit, which
is a process in which past transactions are sampled to determine whether a
company is following generally accepted accounting principles in reporting
prior-year results. It is not designed to guard against future poor business
decisions by management.
In a different era, historical financial information was considered a strong
indicator of financial performance; but today that has changed. The rate of
change in technology and telecommunications, the increased volume of data,
frequent mergers and acquisitions, and the breakdown of barriers have all
made the business environment more volatile than ever. Capital is far more
liquid than ever before: vast sums of money are instantly transferred,
anywhere in the world, with the punch of a button; on the global exchanges,
securities are bought and sold at a dizzying rate.
Today, if a company has an unexpected disaster, it might incur the costs of
clean-up, compensation, litigation, or consumer boycotts - factors that can
be extremely difficult to estimate on a financial statement. In short, there
are more ways to steer a company on to the rocks, with greater speed, than
ever before. Yet the accountants, working in the engine room, receive the
blame.
Nevertheless, there is merit to the larger criticism that accountants have
not fully met the needs of the public. If the traditional audit does not do
so, it should be modified; and I have argued over the years that accountants
must redefine themselves and become more relevant to properly serve the
needs of the marketplace.
The attest process, for example, can take greater advantage of technology to
emphasise 'real-time' data, as opposed to the quarterly or annual
information typical today. Using our knowledge of clients and their
industries, we can develop financial profiles, analyses and comparisons of
business, and develop ways to detect important changes in performance as
they occur. We can also develop forecasts, which - together with financial
statements prepared on an historical as well as a current-value basis - can
be presented as one package, attested to by the auditor.
The ultimate aim for accountants should be to broaden their role in the
marketplace: to offer, in accordance with their expertise, whatever
professional services are necessary to address marketplace changes, and that
are relevant to meeting client, stockholder and other public needs. As the
pace of change quickens and competition intensifies, accurate collection and
interpretation of information can be the critical difference between a
company's success or failure. More than ever, businesses and governments
require the services of highly skilled accountants, consultants and other
professional services providers.
However, the current environment constrains us from offering many of these
services, because in broadening their range we also increase our exposure.
Even now, our 'deep pockets' make us a prime target for investors and other
third parties looking for a scapegoat when a company fails. This is due
principally to the legal doctrine of 'joint and several liability,' which
holds that a convicted party can be held responsible for as much as 100 per
cent of a loss, even if that party is found to have played only a minor role
in the company's downfall.
The doctrine has created a cottage industry of opportunists who file claims
regardless of merit. They use computers to follow volatility in the price of
securities, and file 'cookie-cutter' complaints right off their word
processors. Many lawyers keep a roster of 'professional plaintiffs' ready
and waiting to file a class-action claim at a moment's notice. These 'class
representatives' may be friends or relatives of the strike lawyer, or a
corporation created for the purpose of buying a few shares of stock in
public companies.
This has produced a chilling effect on innovation by the accounting
profession. Increasingly, firms are shying away from doing audits because of
the potential liability. As a result, many small businesses are having a
difficult time finding an auditor; yet these are often the kinds of
businesses most in need of one, in order to attract capital. Meanwhile,
professional services firms are discouraged from offering new services in
high demand - such as environmental auditing - because of liability
concerns. One survey found that four out of five US Certified Public
Accountants have reduced the number of services they offer.
Even if they decide to offer such services, they may find they do not have
the staff to do so. Young people are increasingly afraid to enter the
profession. In the US, the demand for accounting graduates coming out of
college increased by 53 per cent between 1981 and 1991, but the supply
increased by only 2 per cent, while the proportion of students planning to
study in this area dropped by 17 per cent. Meanwhile, at accounting firms
some managers are refusing partnership. They must be thinking: 'Why work all
one's life just to lose most or all of my personal assets in a judgment
against the firm - especially if I was not personally involved in the
particular case?'
The first step must be to replace joint-and-several liability with
proportionate liability; this would hold defendants financially responsible
only to the extent they are found legally responsible, in those cases where
fraud is not alleged.
Another important provision involves fee-shifting: this allows courts to
require unsuccessful litigants to pay the winners' legal fees, if the court
decides the claim was frivolous. This is a modified form of a practice that
has always been followed in the UK and other countries. A third provision
would eliminate abuses such as the payment of bounties to representatives of
class action suits.
Perhaps the most important change would be a shift in society's attitude. I
believe that when a party suffers a legitimate injury from an accounting
firm or anyone else, compensation is rightly expected. But as a society we
must step back from the dangerous tendency to believe that 'someone must
pay', even when we suffer as a result of no one's fault or because the fault
is our own. When that kind of thinking is allowed to flourish unchecked, we
all pay; and the price is always steeper than we realise.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Prices see-saw as traders take cue from
Moscow

EUROPEAN bond markets had another volatile day, sliding at the start, then
clawing back most of their losses through the session, only to slip again in
after-hours futures trading. Prices were buffeted by the Russian crisis, and
continuing uncertainty there is expected to keep activity choppy in the next
few days.
Investor selling was limited, however. 'Some positions were liquidated, but
there was no panic selling,' said Mr John Hall, European economist at Swiss
Bank Corporation.
Indeed, many investors used the early falls as a buying opportunity, traders
said. 'Most people have adopted a wait-and-see stance and won't do anything
drastic until the picture clears up in Russia,' said a London trader.
GERMAN bonds had an active session, with the Bund contract on Liffe hitting
record volume at over 164,000 contracts, up from the previous peak of
147,603 on March 4.
Traders marked down prices early, but Bunds recovered during the day on the
growing perception that Mr Boris Yeltsin was gaining the upper hand in the
Russian power struggle. Sentiment was lifted by reports that the Russian
military would support Yeltsin, reducing the threat of civil war.
However, in after-hours trading, the Bund future sold off sharply as
short-term traders took profits. Moreover, many dealers were reluctant to
hold long positions overnight. Germany's strong political and economic ties
with the former Soviet Union makes its markets particularly vulnerable to
turmoil there.
FRENCH bonds took their cue from Bunds, recouping early losses and easing
back late in the day. Most investors remained on the sidelines, leaving the
market largely in the hands of futures traders.
The government's announcement of the 1994 budget had no effect on bond
prices. 'It contained no surprises, and was relatively small news compared
to the events in Russia,' said Mr Joe Chan, who trades French bonds at
Morgan Stanley.
The Bank of France is not expected to cut its 6.75 per cent repo rate at
today's open-market operation. According to Dominique Barbet, economist with
Paribas Capital Markets, the central bank will likely wait for German money
market rates to ease and for its own foreign currency reserves to be
replenished before cutting rates again.
UK gilts were dragged lower by other European markets. In the cash market,
traders reported switching out of ultra-long maturities into the new 6 3/4
per cent gilts, which are trading on a when-issued basis ahead of next
Wednesday's auction.
According to analysts at market research firm IDEA, there is concern that
foreign interest in the paper will be low because it is 11-year stock.
Others, however, saw the gilts market cheapening enough for the auction to
go well, they noted.
JAPANESE government bonds eased back after Tuesday's rally on
position-squaring ahead of today's national holiday. The JGB December
contract closed at 111.93, down from Tuesday's 112.23 close.
AFTER a quite morning, when political tensions in Russia kept investors and
traders on tenterhooks, US Treasury bonds posted strong gains at the long
end of the maturity range following a successful auction of five-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  17/32 at 102
3/16 , yielding 6.085 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up
1/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 3.891 per cent.
Although Tuesday's fears that Russia might disintegrate into chaos appear to
have abated, concern about the situation, and buying of shorter-dated
securities as a safe haven during unsettling political times remained a
feature of the bond market yesterday.
Trading, however, was subdued throughout the morning session. It was not
until the afternoon that business, and prices, began to pick up at the long
end.

<TEXT>
ITALY'S privatisation process yesterday took a small step forward with the
appointment of three US banks to assist in the sale of Banca Commerciale
Italiana and Credito Italiano.
J. P. Morgan is to value the two banks, among the 10 biggest in Italy, for
the treasury. Goldman Sachs has been appointed 'global co-ordinator' for the
placement of shares in Credito Italiano outside Italy, while Lehman Brothers
is to perform a similar role for BCI.
The appointments, to be confirmed by the boards of the companies today, mark
a significant inroad for US banks to a business which has so far been
dominated by UK merchant banks.
However, the London houses retain a role in the privatising of Italy's
financial institutions. S. G. Warburg was given the mandate last month to
assist in the placing of shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, another big
financial services group.
The stakes in Credito Italiano and BCI to be sold belong to the IRI state
holding company. IRI owns 54.4 per cent of the ordinary shares in BCI and
58.1 per cent of Credito Italiano.
The government has indicated it would like both deals to be completed as
quickly as possible - ideally by the end of this year.
However, observers doubt it will be possible to complete the valuation and
preparation process in time for a placing before early 1994.
The treasury had originally hoped for a trade sale of IRI's stake in Credito
Italiano, or, failing that, disposal to a small group of institutional
shareholders.
Informal soundings early this year by Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank,
revealed only limited interest, leading to the decision to opt for a full
flotation of IRI's holdings.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National returns with FFr1bn
Eurobond offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL instability in Russia failed to slow the recent heavy flow of new
issues in the international bond market yesterday, with several borrowers
raising funds in a variety of currencies.
Abbey National, the UK bank, returned to the French franc sector for the
first time since 1988, raising FFr1bn through an offering of five-year
Eurobonds. Abbey's offering formed one side of a 'back-to-back deal' with
CCCI, the French central financing entity for a network of mortgage lenders.
In the meantime, CCCI made its debut in the Eurosterling sector, raising an
equivalent amount, Pounds 116m, through an issue of five-year floating-rate
notes (FRNs). The two borrowers then swapped the proceeds of their
offerings, so that Abbey ended up with sterling and CCCI with French francs.
This represents the first public 'back-to-back' deal in the Euromarket since
mid-August, when the Province of Ontario and the European Investment Bank
swapped the proceeds of two seven-year Eurobond offerings which raised
Pounds 255m and CDollars 500m respectively.
Mr Jonathan Nicholls, Abbey's director of corporate finance and capital
markets, said the swap provided Abbey with a cost-effective means of raising
funds. The all-in cost of yesterday's deal was around the London interbank
offered rate (Libor), he said.
By contrast, CCCI paid around 35 basis points over Libor for its funds. Mr
Jean-Noel Destremau, CCCI's managing director, said this reflected the fact
that CCCI had paid an 'entry fee' of 4-5 basis points for its first
Eurosterling issue. 'But the back-to-back swap compensated for this
premium,' he said.
He said CCCI aimed to improve its funding target to 25-30 basis points over
Libor in future Eurobond offerings, as well as to seek longer maturities.
Lead manager Samuel Montague said CCCI's notes would be kept in syndicate
overnight to enable investors who were buying CCCI debt for the first time
to obtain the necessary credit lines. He said a large amount of the notes
had been pre-placed with UK and continental accounts.
Abbey's bonds were also kept in syndicate overnight. Joint lead manager CCF
said there had been surprisingly strong demand for the bonds from Spain. The
bonds were also bought by investors throughout Europe.
Elsewhere, Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, the triple A-rated central bank for
the savings banks in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, raised DM1bn
through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the offering was designed to raise the
borrower's profile with international investors.
There is a growing trend among borrowers to reduce dependence on their
domestic market. By tapping the Euromarket, they are able to reach a much
wider range of investors and can often achieve better pricing than at home.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Russia crisis timing a test
for Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Boris Yeltsin's dissolution of the Russian parliament hit the news
after 5pm London time on Tuesday, European futures exchanges had already
closed. It was a case of bad timing for traders, but a vital chance for
Globex, the 24-hour futures trading system, to prove its worth.
Globex, developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, and Reuters, was conceived as a vehicle for global, 24-hour
trading. However, in practice futures markets tend to be liquid only during
the time zone of their domestic market.
When the Russian news broke on Tuesday, the Chicago exchange floors were
still open, but France's Matif products were available only through Globex.
In the event, the Matif traded its second heaviest Globex session, recording
more than 61,000 contracts.
By contrast, the CME traded just over 3,000 contracts and the CBOT 1,730.
Volume in CME products has risen from an average of 1,993 contracts in
August to 2,755, partly reflecting the introduction of equity index products
earlier this week.
Nevertheless, the Chicago exchanges are a long way from their reported
target of 50,000 contracts per US session on Globex by next April.
If this target is not reached, the main backers of Globex could pull out,
according to reports of the contract between them. Even though there has
been an encouraging increase in CME's volume, that target still seems a long
way off.

sell-off

<TEXT>
ENI, Italy's state-owned energy and chemicals group, which is to be
partially sold to the public, yesterday surprised bankers by disclosing a
possible change of plan in the way it is to be privatised.
The revised plan would consolidate Eni's oil and gas activities into one
company. The new concern, probably named Societa Italiana Idrocarburi (SII),
would then be fully or partially floated.
Listing SII represents a radical change from the two previous privatisation
proposals for Eni. The first aimed to list just the Agip upstream oil and
gas business, probably after a merger with the Agip Petroli downstream oil
business.
The alternative to this would have been to float a small tranche of shares
in the entire Eni group.
The second idea has lost ground because of continuing heavy losses at Eni's
chemicals side, and the shadow this casts over any attempt to sell Eni
shares. By contrast, listing the two Agip businesses would only partially
reflect Eni's position as one of the world's biggest energy groups.
SII would probably include Snam (gas supply and distribution), Snamprogetti
(design and engineering) and Saipem (drilling and construction), as well as
to the two Agip businesses.
The SII project would combine Eni's most attractive and profitable
businesses in a single, coherent energy and engineering group.
Before going forward, however, Eni will probably have to remove stakes in
its loss-making EniChem chemicals business from the balance sheets of the
companies comprising SII.
Saipem, already listed, has reported a 28 per cent rise in first-half sales
to L1,098bn (Dollars 700m), confirming the recovery indicated last year. Its
net financial position has improved with a cash surplus of almost L34bn at
end-June against net borrowings of around L81bn last December.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bertelsmann shuns bid for
Paramount

<TEXT>
BERTELSMANN, the large German media group, yesterday denied any intention to
bid for Paramount, the Hollywood-based film group, after reporting net
profit for the year ending June 30 of DM660m (Dollars 407.4m).
But the company said it was continuing discussions with Paramount and with
other US media groups with a view to smaller acquisitions in individual
divisions.
The privately-owned German group had been rumoured as a potential buyer for
Paramount because of its healthy financial position and its desire to expand
in the electronic media field. The group has repaid all its debt and has
accumulated liquid funds totalling DM425m.
Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive of the board, said Paramount was 'too
expensive' and that such a 'grandiose investment was beyond imagination'. He
stressed that it would be incompatible with Bertelsmann's conservative
investment approach. 'We will stick by our policy of a step-by-step
approach, of controlled growth, which has ensured our prosperity,' he said.
Meanwhile, operating profits for the year to June 30 grew by 20 per cent to
DM1.43bn, with worldwide sales rising 6.5 per cent to DM17bn. Net income
rose 16 per cent to DM660m.
Bertelsmann achieved its highest growth in its music division which includes
the Arista Records company of the US. Sales for the division, which accounts
for a third of total, turnover rose 13 per cent to DM4.42bn.
Gruner + Jahr, the second-largest division which comprises newspapers and
magazines, recorded a 4 per cent rise in sales to DM3.75bn. Book clubs, with
23m subscribers worldwide, continued to show good results.
Sales of the printing and manufacturing division were down 3 per cent to
DM2.99bn, mainly due to a fall in the price of paper.
In electronic media, gratifying results came from RTL, the largest private
channel in Germany. But Vox, the private television venture featuring a mix
of news and general programmes and launched at the beginning of the year was
disappointing. Premiere, the only pay-TV channel in Germany, was due to
break even this autumn, the company said.
Bertelsmann stressed it had achieved particularly good results in the US
with Bantam Doubleday Dell, the publishing group reporting profits for the
year.
The company is 68.8 per cent owned by the Bertelsmann Foundation, with the
remaining equity mostly in the hands of the founding family.
Mr Wossner said the current business year would be more difficult because of
the general recession, but results similar to those recorded in 1992-93
could be expected.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Thai bank seeks Bt5bn in notes
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL Finance Corporation of Thailand is to borrow Bt5bn (Dollars 200m)
through an Asian currency note programme that its designers say adds an
extra dimension to the region's capital markets.
Lehman Brothers, the programme's arranger and dealer, is making a series of
issues with maturities ranging from one day to 10 years at fixed or floating
rates in Baht or Hongkong dollars to create a revolving credit line for the
bank.
'The time is right - this lays down a small building block in a huge
movement of capital,' said Mr Phillip Kim, a vice-president of Lehman
Brothers Asia.
Mr Asawin Kongsiri, president of IFCT, which is 31 per cent owned by the
state, said: 'This will make our capital market more international as well
as lower the bank's cost of funds.'
Lehman will arrange the mix of pricing and maturity when the IFCT needs
funds. The first issue is expected to be a fixed-rate note of between Bt1bn
and Bt500m in mid-October. Mr Asawin said that as a quasi-sovereign
borrower, the notes should provide the fledgling Thai domestic capital
market with useful benchmark pricing.
Mr Kim said that Thailand's highly-publicised problems in digesting
infrastructure development, as well as some political uncertainty, was not
likely to trouble the programme.
Joining Lehman as dealer in the note programme will be Bangkok First
Investment &amp; Trust, Finance One Public, IFCT Finance and Securities and
Phatra Thanakit.
New Japan Securities, the second-tier brokerage, is to close six branches in
metropolitan Tokyo, Reuter reports from Tokyo. After the shutdowns, New
Japan will have 76 branches in Japan. The brokerage revised down its
forecast for parent current profit in the September half-year to Y200m
(Dollars 1.9m) from an earlier Y3.5bn forecast.

THE Energy Development Corporation, part of the Philippine National Oil

Although the issue was initially planned at around Dollars 60m, this may be
raised to between Dollars 90m and Dollars 100m in response to strong
investor demand, according to J. P. Morgan. The paper is expected to yield
between 270 and 290 basis points over the corresponding US Treasury note.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hong Kong gives display of
regulation - Simon Davies assesses the government's efforts toward tougher
stock market controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government's report into the corporate activities of Mr Lee
Ming-tee's Allied group - with its 688 pages and costs of HKDollars 46m
(USDollars 5.95m) - is a showcase demonstration of regulatory zeal.
The government and the regulatory authorities have taken great pains to move
forward from the events of October 1987, when the Hong Kong stock exchange
was closed for four days, the futures market collapsed, and corruption
allegations emerged against Mr Ronald Li, the stock exchange chairman who
was subsequently jailed.
Since then, the Davison report on strengthening the regulatory framework has
been implemented, and a new watchdog - the Securities and Futures Commission
(SFC) - has won a tough political battle to gain acceptance in a city
notoriously averse to regulation. The government is understandably anxious
to show that things really have changed for the good.
To some extent they have. A tougher regulatory line has emerged quite a lot
in the past two years. Regulatory opposition has blocked a number of moves -
notably privatisations and asset injections - deemed to be prejudicial to
minority shareholders. More recently, Peregrine Investments, merchant banker
to some of Hong Kong's most influential businessmen, was investigated for
stock market manipulation.
Mr Stephen Clark, director of Anglo-Chinese, a Hong Kong merchant banking
group, said: 'There has been a sea change. There are a lot of investigations
going on, and the SFC is spending a lot of time asking questions about
different transactions. In the end, that will filter through to what people
feel they can get away with.'
The report on Allied attempts to underscore this new climate, ramming home
the message that the government is determined to smoke out wrong-doers. It
details mechanisms through which, it claims, Mr Lee syphoned shareholders'
funds into activities such as the undisclosed control of listed companies,
share price manipulation, and the funding of stock purchases by the
controlling shareholders.
Accountants argue that had it not been for the timing of Mr Lee's activities
 -the investigation focuses on transactions since January 1 1990, a period
in which Hong Kong property and share prices have surged  - the entire
Allied group could have collapsed.
The 10 companies which made up the official and unofficial Allied group had
a combined market capitalisation of HKDollars 7.6bn in August 1992, when the
investigation was launched. Clearly a collapse would have had an devastating
effect on stock market confidence.
However, it can be argued that the report lacks substance, a point taken up
by Mr Brian O'Connor, Allied's managing director. He describes the
investigation as a 'witch hunt' against Mr Lee, and says the report is
little more than 'justification, not justice'.
Mr Nicholas Allen, the government inspector, gives indications of corporate
misfeasance and innumerable breaches of securities regulations. However, he
fails to reveal any great black hole in the Allied balance sheet, and does
not leave the impression that Mr Lee has become a billionaire at the expense
of his shareholders.
Of greater importance, perhaps, is the fact that few people in the financial
sector feel affected by what has become the largest commercial crime
investigation in the history of the colony.
Mr Lee, as a Malaysian with an Australian passport, is considered very much
an outsider by Hong Kong's xenophobic corporate core. Whatever the outcome
of the Allied investigation, it will not be seen as impinging upon their own
fiefdoms. It may also be seen as having little direct relevance in the stock
market, since investors have always labelled the group excessively
speculative.
For all that, however, the Allied investigation is at the front line of Hong
Kong's regulatory image, and the outcome is therefore important.
At present, the stock exchange and SFC are examining potential breaches of
the listing rules, the Takeovers Code and disclosure of interest Ordinance.
The maximum penalty would be a disbarring of individuals from holding
directorships.
At the same time, the government is considering legal action for breaches of
the Companies Ordinance. This would probably focus on allegations of false
accounting, misappropriation of funds, and market manipulation, all of which
are detailed in the report.
The dramatic police raid on Allied's offices last Wednesday suggests the
police are confident they have grounds to prosecute. But they will need to
proceed carefully. As Mr Barry Yates, managing director of brokerage Vickers
Ballas, said: 'The government can't afford to have another Carrian on its
hands.'
The investigation into the 1983 collapse of the Carrian property empire has
cost more than HKDollars 100m in taxpayers' money, but has yielded little
sense of justice.
Corporate Hong Kong would undoubtedly benefit from a demonstration of stock
market wrong-doing being punished. However, if HKDollars 46m and 13 months
of investigation is unable to yield any more than suspicion, the assumption
will be that Hong Kong's no-holds-barred style of capitalism remains very
much alive.

GIB GROUP, the retailer which is Belgium's biggest private-sector employer,
is to cut 3,300 full-time jobs in its nationwide supermarket chain over the
next three years.
The GIB news came as the Belgian government, unions and employers prepared
for talks aimed at restoring the competitiveness of Belgian companies. If
the talks fail, the country's fragile centre-left coalition could fall.
GIB blamed increased competition and high wage costs for putting the chain's
future in jeopardy, in spite of cost-cutting over the last three years. GIB
employs 70,000 people including franchises.
Automobiles Peugeot, also confirmed yesterday it would cut 4,023 jobs.
The past week has seen the announcement of more than 15,000 European job
losses, prompting Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, to urge
restraint on the part of industry.

<TEXT>
ANHEUSER-Busch, the US brewery group, said yesterday that it would reduce
its white-collar workforce by 10 per cent before the end of next year as
part of package of 'significant organisational and operational changes'.
The company said the restructuring would help it cut costs by about Dollars
100m a year beginning in 1994.
It would realise additional savings of Dollars 300m a year by 1997 by
accelerating a modernisation programme at 13 breweries.
In the announcement, which was made after the close of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, the company said the restructuring programme would
result in a one-time pre-tax charge of about Dollars 565m, or Dollars 1.26 a
share, in the quarter to end-September. In the third quarter of 1992,
Anheuser-Busch posted net income of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 1.12.
The company said it hoped to reduce its salaried staff by 1,200 primarily
through attrition and an early retirement package to be offered to employees
aged 53 or older. It also announced a salary freeze during 1994
Campbell Taggart and Eagle Snacks, the company's food divisions, face
operational reorganisation as well. In the first quarter of next year, the
headquarters of both will be moved from Dallas to St Louis, where the the
corporate headquarters are located. About half of the divisions' Dallas
staff will be offered the opportunity to transfer.

stake-building

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph said yesterday that it would not oppose
British Telecom's plan to take a 20 per cent stake in MCI Communications,
AT&amp;T's main rival in the US long distance telephone market.
However, it simultaneously urged the Federal Communications Commission,
which governs the industry, to bring in new rules to ensure that before a
foreign carrier was allowed to operate in the US market, US carriers must
have comparable access to the foreign carrier's market within a reasonable
period - two years as a rule of thumb.
The move came in response to an MCI filing with the FCC seeking confirmation
that the BT deal conforms to commission regulations. BT agreed in June to
take a one-fifth stake in MCI for Dollars 4.3bn.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is considering an application
from AT&amp;T for a licence to gain direct access to the UK public
telecommunications network.
Mr Alex Mandl, chief executive of AT&amp;T's communications services group, said
that 'in the absence of any comprehensive rules, the FCC is allowing
foreign-based carriers to enter the wide-open US market while American
carriers are often kept out of the home market of these foreign companies'.
In a separate filing with the FCC, AT&amp;T also urged the commission to end the
company's designation as the 'dominant' carrier in the US and treat it like
other long-distance companies. AT&amp;T accounts for around 60 per cent of the
US market.

LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, the French industrial and utility group, yesterday
announced a halving of net profits in the first six months of the year from
FFr711m to FFr342m (Dollars 60m).
The company said the downturn reflected the weakness of the European
construction and property sectors but forecast that full-year net profits
would be higher than the FFr379m. achieved in 1992.
The first-half result was achieved on sales of FFr45.1bn, about the same
level as in the corresponding period last year. Exceptional gains fell from
FFr629m to FFr300m between the two periods.
The group's property division continued to suffer in the adverse economic
climate, reporting a net loss of FFr330m compared with a loss of FFr273m in
the first half of 1992.
Construction losses increased more sharply, rising from FFr4m in the first
six months of last year to FFr139m this year.
The holding and services division, however, raised net profits from FFr566m
to FFr768m.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz pierces accounting
mystique - David Waller on the release of German and US figures before a New
York listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ACCOUNTING is the language of business, the American and the German
versions of accounting are as different as mandarin Chinese and Flemish.
Looking at the figures which Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
company, published in both German and US accounting language last week, it
is difficult to imagine how the two versions refer to the same company.
Under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Daimler made a
loss of DM949m (Dollars 586m). Under German rules, the
automobiles-to-aircraft group made a profit of DM168m. The gap is likely to
widen in the second half, and for the year as a whole the group is likely to
report a German profit of DM1bn and a US loss of DM2bn.
Explaining the two versions of the figures goes beyond consideration of
abstruse accounting rules. It raises questions about Daimler's underlying
financial performance and calls into question the assumptions which have
driven the strong rise in the German stock market this year.
Daimler released German and US figures in tandem last Friday is order to
comply with New York Stock Exchange regulations before the company's listing
on the world's largest capital market on October 5. It will be the first
German company to be listed there.
For decades German companies have refused to come to the US market for the
very reason that they did not want to make the financial disclosures
required under GAAP. Scrutinising the Daimler figures, it is not difficult
to see why, as they serve to puncture the mystique which has long surrounded
German accounting.
As Mr Gerhard Liener, Daimler's finance director, said last week, the US
figures provide a more accurate reflection of Daimler's underlying trading
performance than the German version. And that trading performance is far
worse than anyone had dared to predict - especially when Daimler's
management raised hopes by predicting a DM1bn (German) profit for 1992 and
twice as much for next year.
Until last Friday, Anglo-American analysts assumed that German accounts
underestimated a company's profitability. The rules which govern German
accounts put the interests of the tax authorities and creditors higher than
those of shareholders. It was thought that this conservatism served to
deflate profits and balance sheet assets.
By contrast, US and UK rules give companies the freedom to present a 'true
and fair' view of business performance. This is designed to ensure that
shareholders are kept in the picture (not a priority in Germany), but the
flexibility of UK accounting has often been exploited by management to
present an exaggeratedly favourable picture of underlying business
performance.
Thus, if valuations of German shares were a little higher than of US or UK
companies in the same sector, the investment risk was offset by the
conservatism of the numbers on which the valuations were based. In theory.
Daimler's latest disclosures do indeed show that the group's balance sheet
has consistently been understated under German rules.
Show the hidden reserves, and shareholders' equity in Daimler's balance
sheet grows from DM18.9bn at the end of June under German rules, to DM26.2bn
under US rules. However, the detailed figures also reveal that Daimler only
made a profit under German rules because of release of provisions from
hitherto hidden reserves.
In the first half some DM1.62bn of 'changes in appropriated retained
earnings', as this is euphemistically called, flowed from the balance sheet
to the benefit of the German profit and loss account.
In other words, it was nonsense to think that US GAAP would expose the
hidden profitability of the big German company: quite the opposite.
These revelations make Daimler's shares look more, rather than less,
expensive before the listing on the NYSE. This is especially the case when
the shares are compared with those of big US automobile manufacturers - now
possible because Daimler and General Motors are speaking the same accounting
language.
While the shares of the US 'big three' - GM, Chrysler and Ford - are on a
multiple of seven times 1995 prospective earnings, Daimler's shares trade on
15 times US GAAP earnings of DM48 a share (the forecast comes from a
285-page buy note put out by Goldman Sachs this week. The US investment bank
is advising Daimler on its NYSE listing).
The argument that Daimler's structure as 'diversified technology concern'
justifies a higher rating than the German company's US peers is difficult to
defend: the Mercedes-Benz luxury car subsidiary accounted for 67 per cent of
last year's sales and 112 per cent of profits.
In other words, the spate of acquisitions in recent years has reduced the
group's profitability and, if anything, should justify a lower rating than
for a pure cars and trucks group.
If the accounting revelations make Daimler's shares look expensive, the same
is true for the German stock market as a whole. The DAX index of 30 leading
shares has risen by 23 per cent this year to 1,893, much of the increase in
the last three months. Valuations are already giddily high - German
industrial companies are trading at 28 times 1993 and 19 times 1994
earnings. Factor in a discount for the true earnings position as would be
revealed if every component of the DAX 30 sought a US listing, and the
valuations are even ambitious.
Of course, investors have not bought German shares because of this year's
earnings outlook. They are buying on the assumption that there will be a
massive recovery in profits next year and in 1995. That assumption is not
completely undermined by the Daimler disclosures. It is just that the
turnround next year and the year after has to be that much more convincing
to justify today's prices.

ARMCO, the US steelmaker, has sold its Brazilian sheet and strip operations
and will record a charge of Dollars 15m against third-quarter earnings from
the sale and remittances of inter-company debt, Reuter reports.
Armco said it received net cash proceeds of Dollars 55m from the sale to the
Brazilian unit's current management team.
The Brazilian company will purchase ongoing technical assistance from
Armco's corporate research department for five years and will provide
assistance to Armco in the sale of technical services to other companies in
Brazil, Armco said.
It said the sale was a continuation of its strategy to focus on stainless
and electrical steel and divest businesses that do not represent a strategic
fit.

six-month fall

<TEXT>
PINAULT-PRINTEMPS, the French retailing and distribution group, yesterday
announced net profits of FFr189m (Dollars 33m) in the first six months of
the year, a sharp fall from the FFr330m reported in the first half of 1992.
The company, which includes the Printemps department stores and the
Conforama furniture chain, also suffered a decline in operating income, from
FFr1.38bn to FFr938m in the first half. Sales fell from FFr35.38bn to
FFr30.88bn.
The group described 1993 as a difficult year as a result of the recession in
France. However, it said that retail operations had shown strong resistance
to the economic climate and forecast an operating profit of more than FFr2bn
for the year as a whole.
Pinault-Printemps said that financial charges had remained relatively stable
during the period. The company forecast that its debt would be reduced to
FFr13bn by the end of the year because of an estimated FFr5bn in receipts
from disposals.
With respect to business strategy, the company said it would continue to
focus on core activities and to reduce group debts. The sale of CICA, its
car distribution business, to Jardine Matheson, earlier this month was
described as an important step in this process.
The group denied it was considering a sale of Prisunic, its food retailing
operation, but a spokesman said the company was examining the possibility of
an alliance with 'a large distribution group' in the sector to strengthen
its food purchasing operations.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Belgian and French groups make
large-scale job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIB GROUP, the retailer which is Belgium's biggest private-sector employer,
is to cut 3,300 full-time jobs in its nationwide supermarket chain over the
next three years.
The news came as another of Europe's big employers, Automobiles Peugeot,
confirmed that it would be cutting its workforce by about 7 per cent by the
end of next year.
Yesterday's announcement from GIB came as the Belgian government, unions and
employers prepared for a testing round of talks aimed at restoring the
competitiveness of Belgian companies. If the talks fail, the country's
fragile centre-left coalition could fall.
GIB said 4,600 of the 17,000 full-time and part-time employees of the GIB
supermarket chain would lose their jobs. Most of those will be encouraged to
take early retirement, or will simply not be replaced if they leave the
group. The company said the cuts in its supermarket activities would free
BFr5bn (Dollars 144.5m) of new funds.
GIB has blamed increased competition and increasingly high wage costs for
putting the chain's future in jeopardy, in spite of cost-cutting over the
last three years.
Overall, GIB employs just over 57,000 people directly, and 70,000 including
franchises. Its activities include specialised retailing, do-it-yourself
shops and fast food restaurants.
In France, Automobiles Peugeot, part of the Peugeot-Citroen car group, said
its cost-cutting plan would involve the loss of 4,023 jobs.
The decision, which was prompted by the depressed state of the European car
market, is the latest in a series of job cuts by French industry. The past
week has seen the announcement of more than 15,000 job losses, mainly by
publicly-owned companies, prompting Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister,
to urge restraint on the part of industry.
At Peugeot, the planned cuts included 2,547 jobs at the company's Mulhouse,
Sochaux, Lille, Sept Fons and St Etienne plants.
At Poissy, to the west of Paris, where the Peugeot 306 is manufactured,
there will be 1,476 job losses.
Industry analysts said they expected further job cuts at French car and
component manufacturers over the next few months.

<TEXT>
GRUPO TRIBASA, Mexico's second-largest construction company, started trading
on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday after making an initial public
offering of Dollars 263m in international markets, about a third of total
capital.
The offering was priced at Dollars 15.50 per American depositary receipt
(ADR), at the low end of the price range of Dollars 15-Dollars 17. One
underwriter commented that, given the weakness in the Mexican stock market -
which from September 8 to September 21 fell nearly 9 per cent - there was
little option but to price the issue competitively.
The US took 50 per cent of the shares, Europe 30 per cent and Mexico 20 per
cent. The underwriter said the offering was over-subscribed in all markets.
If underwriters take up the option to buy more shares, the total value of
the offering would rise to over Dollars 300m.
Tribasa is the second Mexican construction company to be traded on the NYSE,
following in the steps of Empresas ICA, the country's largest construction
group. The Dollars 15.50 price per ADR values Tribasa at about 9.3 times
prospective earnings, against current value of around 10.3 for ICA.
Tribasa earned about 90 per cent of its revenues from the construction of
Mexico's tollroads last year, far more than ICA. With the road programme in
some financial trouble, and the Mexican government unlikely to grant many
more toll road concessions over the next year, Tribasa is keen to expand
into other areas, such as building water and electricity power plants.
The company is planning to sell bonds backed by some of its more profitable
toll roads in the near future. Assuming the Mexican government's imminent
offer of bonds backed by the state-owned Cuernavaca road is a success,
Tribasa will try to securitise its Ecatepec-Pyramides, and Chamapa-La Venta
roads near Mexico City.

A THIRD Canadian steel-maker, Ipsco, has decided to build a mini-mill in the
US at a capital cost of CDollars 360m (USDollars 272m). It will have annual
capacity of 1m tonnes of light-to-medium plate and hot-rolled coil, writes
Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Ipsco, based in Regina, Saskatchewan, is western Canada's principal
steelmaker with annual capacity of 804,000 tonnes of speciality products. It
earned CDollars 15.5m, or 98 cents a share, in 1992, on sales of nearly
CDollars 500m.
Co-Steel, of Toronto, has operated a mini-mill in the US for more than 20
years and has teamed-up with Dofasco, Canada's biggest integrated
steelmaker, in a new mini-mill now being built in Kentucky. Ipsco has yet to
finalise a location for its mill but it may choose Kentucky.

BANCA NAZIONALE del Lavoro, the Italian treasury-owned bank, reported parent
company pre-tax profits of L152bn (Dollars 96.9m) for the first six months
of this year, up 111 per cent on the L72bn made in the same period last
year, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
Operating earnings, net of extraordinary items, soared by 94 per cent to
L769bn, from L397bn in 1992. Mr Giampiero Cantoni, chairman, attributed the
rise largely to successful securities trading and higher volumes, and
stronger earnings from fee-related business.
The figures should provide a basis for judging the future health of BNL,
still shrugging off the 1989 scandal at its Atlanta branch. BNL's results in
the past two years have appeared confusing, due to its reorganisation and
transformation into a joint stock holding company.
The Aga Khan has reinforced his control of Meridiana, the Sardinia-based
airline, by buying an additional 20 per cent from Ifint International, an
investment group dominated by the Agnelli family, for an undisclosed price.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Schroder Wagg wins sell-off role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. HENRY Schroder Wagg, the UK merchant bank, has been selected to advise on
the privatisation of MVM, Hungary's electricity utility, the AV RT state
holding company has announced.
MVM is Hungary's second largest company with net sales in 1992 of Ft 102bn
(Dollars 1.1bn), on which it made profits of Ft 1.88bn.
Competition was vigorous for the advisory role in the last significant
mandate in Hungary's four-year privatisation programme. Schroders was
selected over Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Brothers.
CSFB and Salomon are among the most active western investment banks in
Hungary, and Schroders' only previous government mandate has been to advise
on the accelerated privatisation programme.
However, Schroders was lead adviser to the UK government on the sale of the
water industry, and the firm's international experience in utility
privatisation appears to have been decisive.
Advisers hope that the MVM sale can be completed next year, probably after
elections scheduled for May.
Under present guidelines, the state will retain a shareholding of 50 per
cent plus one, leaving a minority for privatisation. Advisers also judge
that flotation is inappropriate, which suggests a trade sale.
Beyond that, the structure of the sale remains uncertain. Much will depend
on forthcoming electricity market regulation and the outcome of the
elections.
MVM is the last of Hungary's large state-owned utilities to take on a
consultant.
Lazard Freres of France advised on the privatisation of the state oil
company, MOL, earlier this year, and AV RT expects a sale in one or two
years.
Salomon is advising Matav, the telecommunications company, on the sale of a
minority shareholding.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Iberia may close Miami hub in
drive to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBERIA, the state-owned Spanish national airline, is considering closing its
hub in Miami - less than two years after opening the centre from which it
hoped to service routes to Central America and the Caribbean.
Mr Juan Saez, who was named as Iberia's new managing director in a
management shake-up following the departure earlier this month of the
chairman, Mr Miguel Aguilo, said yesterday that the hub was losing about
Pta2bn (Dollars 15.5m) a year.
A firm decision to close it down would be taken in the next two weeks, he
said.
Mr Saez said that the possible closure of the hub was among a number of
measures that the airline was studying in an effort to bring down costs.
Iberia, he said, was on course this year to make operating losses of around
Pta11bn.
The airline was finding competition from North American airlines too tough,
Mr Saez said, and there was no point 'fighting battles you cannot win'.
A new cost-cutting programme - which would affect the airline's routes at
home and abroad, and the size of its fleet - would be quickly implemented in
order to bring those losses to zero by the end of this year.
Mr Saez said he recognised that this was an ambitious target.
The Miami hub was one of the most prestigious manifestations of Iberia's
ambitions, developed under Mr Aguilo, to become the leading European airline
serving the transatlantic routes to Spanish-speaking America.
As part of the same drive, Mr Aguilo bought large stakes in a variety of
Latin American airlines, including Aerolineas Argentinas.
Mr Saez said that there were no plans to shed any of the assets bought in
Latin America.
Like his predecessor, he believes that Iberia will be unable to escape the
creation of larger airlines in Europe - through mergers or acquisitions -
and that the carrier's large South American assets will lend it greater
muscle when negotiating with potential partners.
However, Mr Saez said that there was no point in Iberia even talking to
other airlines while it was still making heavy losses. It needed to finance
the costs of fleet renewal, the South American expansion and the losses of
the past three years.
'If Iberia is not capable of generating profits then its financial problems
are unsolvable,' Mr Saez said. Iberia would be in a position to talk to
other airlines next year, he said.
Iberia's debts totalled some Pta300bn, Mr Saez explained, half of which was
long term. He expected the airline to make similar losses in 1993 as in last
year, when the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pta42.2bn.
The government injected Pta120bn into the airline last year and Mr Saez said
he did not expect any more aid from the state.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Banks vie for Argentaria 2
mandate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR FRANCISCO Luzon, chairman of Argentaria, the state-controlled Spanish
banking group, will decide within two weeks which international investment
house will receive the mandate for the bank's second issue of shares.
In May, Argentaria raised Pta120bn (Dollars 927.6m) when it issued 24.9 per
cent of its shares. The government has given it the go-ahead to float a
similar volume of its capital in an issue that is likely to raise more than
Dollars 1bn and reduce state ownership of the group to 50.2 per cent.
Mr Luzon indicated yesterday that he had an open mind about which team
should organise the issue of Argentaria 2 and the structure of the
flotation.
'The first issue was a success and worked very well,' Mr Luzon said, 'but
that does not mean it has to be repeated in the same way. There is a lot of
competition for the mandate,' for which the fees alone could be more than
Dollars 10m.
Front-runners for Argentaria 2 are Morgan Stanley (which was global
co-ordinator of Argentaria 1 and lead manager for its US tranche) and SG
Warburg (which, with the Spanish bank Banco Santander de Negocios, was
co-leader of the UK tranche).
Morgan Stanley appears confident that since the two issues are so close  -
Argentaria 2 could be floated as early as November 7 - broad market
practices will dictate an unchanged team and structure.
SG Warburg appears just as confident that its experience as co-ordinator of
last July's third issue of British Telecommunications shares will count in
its favour.
Mr Luzon believes that the simultaneous trading pioneered by BT is an
attractive option.
'BT was very bold and the tendency now for big share issues is clearly to
globalise. Banks are much more localised than telecommunications, but if we
cannot be wholly global like BT in our flotation, we should at least reduce
the geography of the tranches.'
Argentaria 1 had five tranches which covered Spain, the US, the UK,
continental Europe and the rest of the world.
Mr Luzon believes that this structure could be altered for Argentaria 2.
'We have to have a domestic tranche and my minimum hypothesis is that there
should be the Spain issue and an international one, just two tranches.'
It is likely that 50 per cent of the Argentaria 2 issue will be aimed at the
domestic retail market and the other 50 per cent at international
institutions.
Argentaria 1 was heavily over-subscribed, particularly in the US, where
demand was 11 times the amount floated, and in the the UK, where it was 12
times.
Whoever wins the mandate will have to share the role with the Spanish
banking community. This was the case in Argentaria 1 when, in addition to
the co-lead mandate with SG Warburg that was awarded to Banco Santander de
Negocios, Argentaria itself acted as co-global co-ordinator with with Morgan
Stanley.
'I very much want Spanish banks to be active in the share issue,' Mr Luzon
said. 'They now distribute well, especially in Europe, and they have the
capacity to do a lot more.'
In his promotion of the domestic banks, and in particular of Argentaria, Mr
Luzon has his eye on the forthcoming European privatisations, where he
believes Spanish institutions could become a strong force.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: JVC, Hitachi underline
audio-visual downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TROUBLES afflicting Japanese makers of audio-visual products were
underlined yesterday by a profits downgrade from JVC and an announcement
from Hitachi that it was closing its German video-recorder (VCR) factory.
JVC, which developed the international video tape standard, said the
prolonged recession in the market and the yen's appreciation had forced a
revision of its profits forecast for the year ending March 1994.
It expects a pre-tax loss of Y25bn (Dollars 235.2m) for this year, rather
than breaking even as it had expected in May. Sales are forecast at Y505bn,
or 6 per cent below the Y540bn predicted earlier.
On a consolidated basis, pre-tax losses are forecast at Y31bn rather than
Y800m, on sales of Y700bn, down from its previous forecast of Y780bn.
JVC said it hoped to return to profit even if sales remained at the Y500bn
level.
The company is reducing its staff by 2,000 by 1995, through natural wastage
and by not renewing contracts with part-time workers, moving its
headquarters from Tokyo to Yokohama, and strengthening its sales force.
About 400 employees at headquarters and factories are being transferred to
sales.
Meanwhile, Hitachi's consumer electronics operations in Germany became the
latest victim of Europe's sluggish audio-visual market, as the company
announced it was closing its VCR manufacturing facility there.
The company said the strength of the D-Mark and weak European demand for
audio-visual products had forced it to close the plant. Production has
declined to 13,000 units a month this year from a monthly peak of 45,000
units in 1989.
Last year Hitachi made a Y42.6bn loss in its consumer products division,
which followed a Y14.6bn loss the previous year. It also closed its VCR
plant in the US, where it had been manufacturing 100,000 units annually, and
moved production for the US market to Malaysia.
Hitachi plans to meet European demand for VCRs from its plants in the UK
and, if necessary, Malaysia. But 'the pie is shrinking', the company said,
adding that the situation in the market remained extremely difficult.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Devaluations prompt 7% fall at
BSN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY devaluation in some principal European markets prompted a 7 per
cent fall in first-half net profits at BSN, France's largest food
manufacturer, the company announced yesterday.
The group said that virtually all of the decline in net profits to FFr1.82bn
(Dollars 322m) in the first six months of this year, from FFr1.95bn in the
first half of 1992, reflected the currency impact of consolidating profits
from countries such as the UK, Italy and Spain, which had seen their
currencies depreciate during the period.
BSN also suffered as a result of reduced demand resulting from the recession
in Europe. The biscuit division, which saw operating profits fall from
FFr485m to FFr339m, is undergoing a restructuring and is one of the
company's principal areas of expansion in central Europe and Asia.
With the exception of beer, all of the group's other divisions - fresh
produce, pasta, mineral water and packaging - suffered a decline in
operating profits.

FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Telekom leads bid for Hungarian
phone stake
</HEADLINE>

   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Telekom, the state-owned German telecommunications company, has
linked with Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Ameritech of the US in a
consortium to bid for at least 30 per cent of Matav, the Hungarian national
operator.
This will be the one of the biggest privatisations in eastern Europe and the
first sale of a telecoms utility, albeit of a minority stake.
The value of Matav, and the likely size of the bids, will remain unclear
until the government's pricing formula is announced.
Washington-based International Technology Consultants value Matav at Dollars
3.3bn. Matav executives have quoted the figure approvingly, but bidders
dismiss the estimate.
Privatisation advisers said that the composition of the consortium could
alter in the run-up to the submission of bids next month.
Officials, consortium executives and advisers privately confirmed that C&amp;W
and Ameritech agreed to join under the leadership of Deutsche Telekom.
Other companies which bought the information memorandum for the
privatisation are France Telecom, Italy's Stet, Japan's NTT, and US regional
Bell operating companies Southwestern Bell and US West.
Telekom, C&amp;W and Ameritech were regarded as strong individual bidders and
rivals are concerned that their combination will be difficult to match.
A group led by Telekom missed winning a digital mobile telephone concession
last month despite offering the highest fee. Many suspect that the Hungarian
authorities denied Telekom the digital cellular concession because they were
'saving' the German bidder for Matav.
Mr Gyorgy Schamschula, Hungary's telecoms minister, rejected any connection
between the cellular tender and privatisation.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Offshoot sale lifts Tilbury Douglas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TILBURY DOUGLAS, the construction group, lifted interim pre-tax profits from
Pounds 6.98m to Pounds 12.8m, with the help of a Pounds 6.78m profit on the
sale of a subsidiary. The shares were unchanged at 595p.
Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said trading conditions remained
difficult in the first half although there were now signs of a slow recovery
in the UK.
The group is 'avidly' searching for acquisitions, he said, and has net cash
of Pounds 14.4m - up from Pounds 4.83m a year earlier and Pounds 6.94m in
the 1992 balance sheet - following the sale of Douglas Concrete and
Aggregates in May for Pounds 14.7m, which gave a net cash benefit of Pounds
10.8m.
Mr Bottjer said work in hand in the construction division was about the same
as a year ago, although there had been an increase in the proportion coming
from overseas from 3 per cent to 12 per cent.
Margins were better in places such as the Middle and Far East than in the
UK, he said, and the group aims to increase further the proportion of its
overseas work.
In the UK, he saw little sign of recovery in mainstream contracting until
towards the end of 1994. However, some specialist areas, such as heavy
electrical contracting and process engineering were good.
Others, such as interior contracting, largely for the big retail groups, and
piling and foundation work, both of which had suffered in the first half,
were now enjoying a busy period.
The group's Scottish housebuilding business had a good first quarter.
Although business dropped off in the second quarter, it had revived again
since the end of June.
Group turnover was down 11 per cent at Pounds 169.3m, with that from
continuing operations down a similar percentage at Pounds 166.2m.
Pre-interest profits from continuing operations fell 34 per cent to Pounds
3.33m, with Douglas Concrete contributing Pounds 505,000 (Pounds 352,000).
Associates made Pounds 248,000 (Pounds 28,000).
Interest received rose from Pounds 1.56m to Pounds 1.94m. Earnings per
share, boosted by the Douglas Concrete sale, rose from 13.9p to 26.9p. The
interim dividend is maintained at 10.5p.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Food ingredients prove the key to healthy
growth - Kerry, the Irish food company, looks set to expand into an
international force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISTINCTIVE country smells of silage-making and muck-spreading fill
one's nostrils on stepping off the commuter aircraft at Kerry airport in the
west of Ireland at this time of year.
A patchwork of green fields, lush with tender grass, spreads for miles in
every direction. Just up the road, lies Tralee, whose main claim to fame was
as a former garrison town for British troops, and where the girlfriend of a
lovesick Irishman was to become immortalised in the ballad, 'The Rose of
Tralee'.
Over the past 20 years though, one of Ireland's largest food companies has
emerged from this agricultural backwater. It is largely the result of the
commitment of 5,000 small dairy farmers and the acumen of its executives who
have transformed a small dairy co-operative with turnover of IPounds 1m in
1974 into an international food business with an annual turnover now
exceeding IPounds 800m (Pounds 755m).
The group has emerged as the leader among the quoted Irish food stocks, and
the one considered by market analysts most likely to achieve the scale and
financial muscle necessary to compete in the international food industry by
the end of the decade.
At its annual meeting earlier this year, Mr Denis Brosnan, the managing
director, said that the company's five-year plan envisaged it achieving
turnover of IPounds 1.5bn and profits of about IPounds 50m. This would
continue the group's now-established trend of doubling turnover and profits
every five years.
'Kerry is a steady, consistent company. They lay out their development
strategy for a five-year period ahead and then set about achieving it
exactly as planned,' said Mr Joe Gill, food sector analyst with Riada, the
Dublin stockbrokers.
Pre-tax profits for the current year are forecast by Mr Gill to reach some
IPounds 34.3m following an interim result last month of IPounds 13.6m, a 28
per cent increase. He expects earnings per share to reach 20p by 1994, up
from 15.8p last year and a forecast 17.8p for 1993.
Key to Kerry's growth and success has been its diversification out of dairy
processing into meat processing, and more important, into the food
ingredients industry.
Mr Brosnan said that in the early 1980s, the group lost 20 per cent of its
milk volume because of a brucellosis eradication programme in the company's
milk catchment area in Kerry. 'At that point we decided to diversify,' he
said.
An aggressive acquisition programme followed, financed by share issues,
borrowings and cash.
Milk now forms just 25 per cent of the group's business. Food ingredients
accounted for almost 40 per cent of turnover in the first half of 1993, and
is the highest margin and fastest-growing part of the business.
Kerry's main acquisition in this sector took place in 1988 with the purchase
of Beatreme in the US, which Mr Brosnan said 'produced a major change in our
organisation'.
Concentrating first in dairy-based food ingredients - large quantities of
casein, a by-product of milk processing, are shipped to the US from Kerry's
Irish plants - the group has since expanded into other niches of the market
to the point where it is now a leading supplier of specialised food
ingredients in the US.
And following recent acquisitions in Europe, it is positioning itself well
in the EC food ingredients market.
Spending some IPounds 4m annually in research and development, Kerry has
established itself as a principal supplier to some of the leading
convenience and snack-food producers in the US, which have preferred to
source from specialist suppliers such as Kerry and cut back their own
research and development expenditures on ingredients.
Mr Gill said that 'the European snack food market is rapidly consolidating
with a small number of (US) companies emerging to dominate the sector . . .
this trend suggests the EC market will evolve to resemble that of the US,
where Kerry is already a leading supplier of ingredients to the industry'.
Mr Brosnan said he anticipated the group would eventually become a worldwide
manufacturer of food ingredients.
In the immediate future the company plans expansion in the US, Latin America
and the EC, and possibly the Far East, but will it have the financial
wherewithal to maintain the momentum of its exponential growth rate and
achieve its next five-year target?
One restraining factor is the group's hybrid co-operative-plc structure.
Some 55 per cent of the group's shares are held by Kerry Co-op, the
company's founder, which in turn is held by 5,000 farmer-shareholders. These
have loyally supported the group through three rights issues, but there is a
market perception that the group needs to further diversify its shareholder
base if it is to continue its expansion.
Rights issues and placements have raised a total of IPounds 60m since
flotation, and the co-op shareholding has been gradually diluted from 83 per
cent to 55 per cent today. Mr Brosnan says there are no plans for the time
being to reduce the co-op holding below 51 per cent, although it is widely
believed that Kerry will be the first of all the Irish co-op-plc hybrids to
do so.
Last month, the co-operative's 90m B shares were converted pari passu to
ordinary A shares. Five per cent of the farmers' 8m shares in the
co-operative were simultaneously converted on an 11-to-1 basis into A shares
in Kerry Group, giving the farmer-members their first freely-tradeable
shares as individual shareholders, rather than holding all their stake
through the co-operative.
Each share in the co-operative is thus now worth IPounds 30.8 at the current
A share price of IPounds 2.80. Put another way, an individual Kerry farmer
having invested IPounds 1,000 in the co-op in 1974 and followed the
subsequent rights issues, would today have an investment worth IPounds
250,000 in Kerry Group. Few other farmers in Ireland could boast that sort
of compound growth in their assets. Irish fund managers who presently hold
most of the A shares have already taken note.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wates City in Pounds 24m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATES CITY of London Properties, which in August reported a pre-tax profits
fall from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 860,000 and a passed dividend for the first
half of 1993, is to raise about Pounds 24m net in a rights issue.
Mr Rodney Clutton, development and property director of the company, all of
whose properties but one fall within the core of the City, said the proceeds
would be used to reduce borrowings 'to a comfortable level'. At June 30 they
stood at Pounds 95m, since when they have been cut by Pounds 12m to Pounds
83m via the sale of Bolsa House, Cheapside.
Wates said that at December 31 1992 gearing was 102 per cent. Adjusting for
the rights proceeds and the Bolsa House sale, pro forma gearing at that same
date would have been about 48 per cent.
Some 34.3m new shares are to be issued at 72p on a two-for-seven basis.
Wates shares closed down 6p at 82p last night.
The company said that after a long period of decline, there was now evidence
that City property values were stabilising. Mr Clutton said that the rights
issue was so that 'we don't have to sub-optimise and can protect our crown
jewels', especially 100 Old Broad Street and 90 Queen Street.
At the end of 1992, Wates sold 1-6 Milk Street for Pounds 9.35m and 20
Cannon Street for Pounds 14.2m.
Mr John Nettleton, finance director, said in August that these properties
were 'over-rented and old', but Mr Clutton said that more could have been
got for them now.
The rights has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. Brokers are
Cazenove and SG Warburg Securities.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: PizzaExpress at Pounds 1.42m and continues
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIZZAEXPRESS sold more than 3m of its upmarket pizzas in the 134 days
between coming to the market via a reverse takeover in February and its June
30 year end, helping the company to lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 119,000
to Pounds 1.42m for the year.
In spite of improved earnings per share of 4.7p (1.9p), the board is not
recommending a final dividend as promised at the time of flotation because
High Court permission to dip into reserves came too late. Instead, in
November, the board is to pay a first interim dividend of 0.5p for the six
months to February next year, and is likely to pay another at that stage.
Turnover rose from Pounds 7.33m to Pounds 15.7m. Mr Peter Boizot, founder of
PizzaExpress and now non-executive chairman, said: 'It's not surprising the
company's done well since it's come from a good base.'
The pizza and distribution business achieved sales of Pounds 8.22m in the 4
1/2 months since its acquisition by Star Computer, with computing, which the
company has now sold, having turnover of Pounds 7.51m.
The company, which owns 29 restaurants and franchises 41, aims to fund up to
10 new pizzerias annually, and plans to own half the outlets.
Mr David Page, managing director, said the company was 'absolutely
committed' to the 'quality and value' of its pizza. Some suppliers had been
changed but only where quality was held and price improved.
Mr Boizot said: 'I don't think they have moved that many suppliers. They
have changed a rather splendid and unique wine that we had into one that is
a little more popular. Maybe that's what pizza eaters want.'
Trading in company restaurants had been strong, Mr Page said, with sales up
about 8 per cent in the February to August period with both increased
customer volume and expenditure per head. There had been a similar pattern
in the franchised restaurants.
That improvement had also benefited the wholesale and beer importing
divisions.
Net interest received fell to Pounds 2,000 (Pounds 32,000).
The group has no debt following a rights issue at the time of the flotation
and at the year end had net cash of Pounds 2.4m.
Since June 30 the restaurants and distribution company has exchanged
contracts for the sale of the computer business for Pounds 2.23m including
the repayment of Pounds 1.73m inter-company debt. PizzaExpress will receive
Pounds 100,000 in cash and hold 20 per cent of the new company, valued at
Pounds 400,000, which will retain a three-year buy-back option.

of the sale of two US businesses at the beginning of this year.
The shares rose 22p to close at 330p.
Mr Brian Turnbull, finance director, said: 'Most of our revenue and
operating profits are earned in the second half of the year. The downward
trend seen in 1991 and 1992 has been reversed and the company is now growing
and growing profitably.'
Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman, said: 'The position in the UK improved in
the second quarter. In the third quarter that improvement was maintained.
'It is still a market that is patchy and the all-important fourth quarter at
this stage is still wide open.'
He added that the improved level of orders in the UK should compensate for
any shortfalls in France and Belgium.
The company is watching developments in the planned privatisation of London
Transport Advertising, the London Transport department that is the capital's
largest poster contractor and generates sales of Pounds 23m a year.
'They would certainly offer a very interesting opening in the London
market,' said Mr Gore-Andrews, adding that the company's bus shelter
business would not be affected.
Mr Gore-Andrews said tobacco advertising now accounted for 7 per cent of
turnover in Belgium and about 6 per cent in Britain, but the company had
acted to minimise the impact of any possible ban throughout Europe.
'The job of our marketing has been to broaden the base of customer demand in
all our markets, so that we are not too dependent on one sector.'
Currency fluctuations translated revenue falls in local currencies into
revenue gains in sterling in both France and Belgium.
The Belgian business turned in operating profits down at Pounds 1.11m
(Pounds 1.32m), in spite of an increase in sites. Turnover was Pounds 6.15m
(Pounds 5.49m).
Mr Turnbull said last year's 'fairly drastic cost cutting measures' had
helped the French activities lift operating profits to Pounds 603,000
(Pounds 263,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.42m).
Operations in Taiwan posted a 'useful' Pounds 148,000 operating profit
against last time's Pounds 28,000 loss. Turnover was Pounds 494,000 (Pounds
1.23m).
In the UK and Ireland, the company's main market, a sales increase to Pounds
18.7m (Pounds 16.5m) resulted in an operating profit of Pounds 958,000
(Pounds 241,000), with the number of sites increased by 170.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 744,000 (Pounds 857,000).
The interim dividend is unchanged at 3.2p, payable from earnings per share
ahead to 4.4p (2.1p).

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Fleming Chinese ups issue size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEMING Investment Trust Management has increased the issue size of the
Fleming Chinese Investment Trust from a maximum of Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m,
after greater than expected demand during the placing stage.
Indications of interest have been received for 45m ordinary shares at 100p,
with one warrant attached to every five shares. Up to 15m shares are
available through the public offer, which opened yesterday, and closes at
10am on Friday October 8. Dealing is expected to start on October 19.
Expenses for the issue will be capped at 3.5 per cent, and the annual
management charge will be approximately 1.45 per cent.
The portfolio will be managed on a day-to-day basis by Jardine Fleming in
Hong Kong. It will invest in Chinese companies listed in China and Hong
Kong, and non-Chinese companies deriving a large part of their profits or
revenues from China.
The number of companies with shares available to foreign investors listed on
Chinese stock exchanges is low; demand is high, however, so only a small
portion of the fund will initially be invested directly in China.
The fund's objective is capital growth and the shares are not expected to
pay a dividend.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sterling devaluation behind 9% increase at
Spirax-Sarco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPIRAX-SARCO Engineering, the steam equipment specialist which makes 75 per
cent of its sales overseas, lifted first-half pre-tax profits by 9 per cent
from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.4m on the back of sterling's devaluation.
The group estimated that the change in exchange rates was worth Pounds 1.2m
on pre-tax profits.
Earnings per share were 10 per cent ahead at 8.6p (7.8p). The interim
dividend goes up to 6.6p (2.7p), equal to the 1992 final dividend.
In order to reduce advance corporation tax ahead of the November budget, it
is offering an alternative enhanced scrip dividend worth 9.9p per share. It
estimates the ACT saving at Pounds 1.3m if there is a 90 per cent take-up.
UBS will buy back the shares at a minimum value of 9.702p, or 98 per cent of
the value.
Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said the group saw no tangible sign of
improved trading conditions in its main markets. However, the group's
fundamental strengths had enabled it to advance. He defined these as a
diverse customer base; a broad geographic spread; a 50 per cent replacement
element, and its world market leadership.
Spirax last year made 18 per cent of sales in the UK, 31 per cent in the
Americas, 30 per cent in continental Europe and 21 per cent in Asia and the
rest of the world.
Turnover for the half was ahead 11 per cent at Pounds 90.8m (Pounds 81.4m).
The latest figure included Pounds 5.3m from the acquisition earlier this
year of its Italian licensee and a 25 per cent stake in its Spanish
licensee. Last year's figure included Pounds 6.7m from the Drayton domestic
heating controls business sold in March.
Interest payable fell to Pounds 651,000 against Pounds 798,000. Net
borrowings at the end of June were Pounds 24m (Pounds 17m at end of
December), giving gearing of 30 per cent (20 per cent).

FT  23 SEP 93 / Alumasc rises 5% and makes building products purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMASC, the manufacturer of beer kegs, precision components and building
products, yesterday announced an increase of 5 per cent in annual pre-tax
profits and the acquisition of MR Holdings for an initial Pounds 6.4m.
In the year ended June 30 1993 profits advanced from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds
7.55m, on turnover reduced to Pounds 44.9m, compared with Pounds 45.3m.
Mr John McCall, chairman and chief executive, said the increase had been
achieved without any improvement in economic conditions or large acquisition
activity in the year.
It was mainly through previous restructuring and earlier acquisitions to
reduce dependence on the beer keg market, he said.
MR, a privately-owned external wall insulation company, will bolster
Alumasc's building products division.
The acquisition will be funded initially by the issue of 730,000 shares, of
which 552,000 are being placed with institutional and other investors, and
Pounds 2.4m cash. Further profit-elated consideration is payable up to a
maximum Pounds 2.25m cash.
MR made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.1m from sales of Pounds 7.8m in the
year to June 30 1993. Mr McCall said the acquisition would enhance the
prospects of the building products division, where operating profits fell
from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 3.1m over the year.
Difficult trading conditions in other parts of the group, such as Euroroof
where sales declined 20 per cent to Pounds 7m, were offset by growing demand
for new beer kegs and increased operating profits in the precision
components division.
Demand for kegs helped the container division increase operating profits by
Pounds 860,000 to Pounds 2.5m, while operating profits in components rose 9
per cent to Pounds 1.66m. Mr McCall said the improvement in components was
achieved in spite of problems associated with customers not taking up
expected orders.
Overall, the group's performance benefited from the lower cost base
resulting from earlier rationalisation and redundancies, he added. The
affect of these measures enabled the company to retain a net cash balance of
Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3.5m).
Earnings per share rose to 33.9p (31.3p). The final dividend is 8.05p,
bringing the total to 11.75p (11p).
It is proposed to subdivide the 25p shares into 12 1/2 p to assist
marketability. The shares were unchanged at 570p yesterday.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Gas fined over billing
irregularities in Argentina
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS, which operates Metrogas, the biggest gas distribution company
in Argentina, is to be fined between Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 65,000) and
Dollars 500,000 by Argentine government regulators for irregularities in
billing to consumers.
Mr Raul Garcia, head of Enargas, the regulator, said: 'We have noticed very
many complaints from clients about excessive billing by Metrogas', and
inspectors were investigating. However, an Enargas official said a decision
had been made in principle to fine the company but the final decision on the
amount would be taken once investigations were completed.
Metrogas, 29 per cent owned by British Gas, was privatised last December in
a Dollars 300m cash and debt for equity swap. It distributes gas in Buenos
Aires and nine surrounding districts.
Mr Rob Verrion, Metrogas president, said complaints stemmed from increased
consumption during the winter and higher than expected bills because of the
introduction of meter reading; previously, consumption was often understated
by estimated meter readings. Metrogas said complaints were running at only 3
per cent of the 45,000-80,000 invoices posted daily.
Mr Verrion claimed the investigation was politically motivated. He said
elections were due on October 3 and 'someone took it into their head to make
an issue of this.' He said Metrogas was a target as privatised companies
were the subject of 'many complaints because privatisation was sold as a
solution to problems and they're not. They're just the beginning of the
solution.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Carlton to issue Dollars 200m of perpetual
debt in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Communications, the UK television company, is to issue Dollars 200m
of perpetual debt in the US, making it the first foreign non-financial
company to tap a market usually the preserve of banks.
Carlton said the deal will hedge its balance sheet by securing long-term
finance for its US investments in a form that is similar to equity but tax
deductible and does not involve diluting share-holders.
The deal, which is being led by Merrill Lynch, involves the issue of
fixed-rate subordinated paper called Exchangeable Capital Securities, which
can be converted at the option of the company into preference shares.
Mr Bernard Cragg, Carlton's finance director, said the issue would be
carried on the company's balance sheet as debt, although it does not have to
be repaid and is free of covenant restrictions.
The deal is expected to offer a yield some 200 basis points above long-dated
Treasury bonds, slightly higher than that on a similar issue by Barclays
Bank.
Merrill Lynch is expected to sell the issue to its retail clients who have
been seeking to improve the return on their investments as yields in the
bond market have fal-len.
Mr Cragg said Carlton, which has no net debt, had been able to exploit the
opportunity because its American Depositary Receipt programme meant it could
meet Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements and had
already received an unpublicised single-A rating from leading rating
agencies.
Carlton could borrow at much cheaper interest rates in the floating rate
eurodollar market, but said a perpetual subordinated issue cost only 60-80
basis points more than a conventional long-term bond.
The company believed the issue was good value at current long-term rates.
'To the extent that people feel that interest rates are going up, we feel
it's a bargain,' Carlton said.

value

<TEXT>
CANTAB Pharmaceuticals, the Cambridge-based bio-technology company already
quoted in the US, yesterday launched its pathfinder prospectus for a UK
flotation through a placing set to be priced on September 19.
The issue is expected to raise Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m and value the company
at about Pounds 50m. It is likely to be priced relative to that prevailing
in the US where Cantab issued 1m shares at Dollars 10 (670p) last year.
Cantab is some way from producing a marketable product but is closest with a
drug called LM-CD45, designed to reduce the incidence of rejection in kidney
transplant operations.
Mr Paul Hancock, chief executive, said a key strength of the company had
been the links it had formalised with British academic institutions, notably
Cambridge University.
BZW is acting as adviser. The shares will start trading on October 25.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Interest cut lifts Barratt to Pounds 20m -
Continuing recovery underlined with 81% rise and increased final
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRATT Developments, Britain's third largest housebuilder, underlined its
continued recovery yesterday by posting an 81 per cent increase in full year
pre-tax profits and increasing its final dividend.
Pre-tax profits in the year ended June 30 jumped to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds
11.3m) on turnover which fell by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 405.3m (Pounds
438.3m).
The profit improvement mainly reflected a sharp reduction in interest costs
which dropped to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 15.9m) as the group's net debt fell to
Pounds 34m at the end of June from Pounds 57.1m a year earlier. Earnings per
share rose to 9.3p (7.8p) and the group is paying a final dividend of 3p
(2p) which makes a total of 4p for the year - double the previous year when
there was no interim payment.
The improved profits and dividend helped push Barratt's shares higher
yesterday to close 15p higher at 187p.
Operating profits fell slightly to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 28.5m), but the
decline was more than offset by a Pounds 400,000 share of profits from
associated undertakings, compared to a Pounds 1.3m loss previously.
The group sold 4,988 homes during the year - up from 4,706 - in addition to
which, the construction subsidiary completed another 314 housing association
homes.
The average selling price fell to Pounds 74,800 (Pounds 79,900) with the
decline mainly reflecting changes in the product mix as Barratt built more
smaller first-time buyer properties.
Sir Lawrie Barratt, who came out of retirement to rescue Barratt two years
ago, said the group had made sound progress working its way through its
historic land stocks, the majority of which could only be developed in the
upper price ranges and which yielded very low margins or incurred losses.
As part of a three-year growth plan to rebuild UK housing volume, Barratt
plans to sell 5,700 houses this year rising to 8,000 in 1995-96.
The group's US subsidiary, which builds homes in southern California and
accounts for about 8 per cent of group turnover, reported an unchanged
trading loss of Pounds 700,000 last year, although Mr Frank Eaton, chief
executive, said he hoped the business would make a small contribution to
profits this year.
He said that Barratt planned to reduce its investment in the recession-hit
California market by accelerating completions to about 500 this year and
reducing the US land bank.
COMMENT
With Sir Lawrie back in the driving seat, Barratt's recovery has been
underpinned by a reduction in total debt from Pounds 205m in June 91 to
Pounds 43m at the end of June this year - equivalent to gearing of 22 per
cent. Now that the UK housing market ismoving in the right direction,
Barratt should be able to boost volumes and margins this year. Pre-tax
profits should reach Pounds 32m, equivalent to 12.8p of earnings. With a
prospective p/e of 14.6 the shares are undervalued relative to other
housebuilders and despite yesterday's gains are still a good recovery buy.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hostages to declining housing market
fortunes - Andrew Bolger looks at the events leading up to the boardroom
clear-out at Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS eight short weeks as chairman of Spring Ram, Mr Roger Regan has
become used to grim jokes about what he would do to the former stock market
star - on the lines of 'kitchen-sinking' the accounts and management
bloodbaths.
Yesterday's announcement of a boardroom clear-out, heavy losses and a
much-depleted balance sheet lived up fully to its lurid advance billing. But
Mr Regan, a veteran of the building industry, also insisted: 'I know this
company is fundamentally sound.'
Invited to take over by Prudential Corporation and other institutional
investors, Mr Regan said that he and Mr Martin Towers, his new finance
director, were confident they had got to the bottom of the Yorkshire
company's problems. The chairman said: 'We've turned over the whole field
and made sure there's nothing else.'
The new team at Spring Ram believes that the departing management at the
bathroom and kitchens group became prisoners of their own propaganda, and
the high expectations they had raised in the City of being able to maintain
growth - even through the UK housing market's worst crash.
Founded by Mr Bill Rooney in 1979, Spring Ram rapidly became a leading
producer of self-assembly kitchens and bathrooms by investing heavily in
technologically advanced factories on greenfield sites.
However, problems began to surface in 1991, when the falling housing market
made it increasingly difficult for the group to maintain the growth which
had turned it into a highly-rated stock.
Mr Regan said: 'Senior management did not want to recognise that the
recession had happened, and kept up the pressure on managers to deliver.'
Mr Towers said: 'There was a culture of override by head office. Certain
individuals went out of their way to wind it all up, and were still reaching
for the sky as trading deteriorated.'
The new finance director said it was these pressures which lay behind what
he described as 'very aggressive' previous accounting, such as the early
booking of sales, treatment of grant income and spending on marketing and
business development, and the sale and leaseback of plant and equipment.
The new chairman believes the departure of 10 directors - including three at
board level - has removed the problem, and said financial staff and managers
in the group were now relieved to be working in a more realistic
environment.
He said Spring Ram's shift from having Pounds 45m in cash in the bank at the
end of 1991 to its current position of carrying a significant level of core
borrowings came as a surprise to most of the management.
The chairman believes that an important check on the business was lost when
Mr Bob Murray, co-founder of Spring Ram with Mr Rooney, left the group in
1990. Mr Regan said: 'As well as marketing drive, every business needs
someone who goes around switching off the lights every night, and asks:
'What happens if this goes wrong?' '
The most expensive misjudgments by the old guard were the start-up last year
of two businesses, Regency Doors and Artisan Tile, which Mr Regan said 'were
permitted to commence trading without the benefit of definitive business
plans, and without an adequate appreciation of the technical, production and
marketing issues surrounding the early development of the businesses.'
The operations lost an aggregate Pounds 6.2m in the six months to July 3.
Most of the losses were made at Regency, on which the group has to date
invested a total of Pounds 46m.
Mr Regan's decision to keep them going is the most controversial and
unexpected of his initial decisions, since analysts and institutional
investors had been bracing themselves for an early closure.
The chairman acknowledges that the write-down involved would have blown such
a substantial hole in Spring Ram's balance sheet that he would probably have
had to seek a rights issue, but denied that was the deciding factor in the
decision to keep them trading.
He was confident that Regency could be turned into a profitable,
cash-generative business, although he anticipated between 12 and 18 months
of reducing losses while technical and marketing problems were solved.
Mr Regan bases his confidence in Spring Ram as a whole on the high standing
which he says the group's products have with its biggest customers, such as
Texas and B&amp;Q, the DIY multiples. But he believes that decentralisation
within the group has been taken to excessive lengths, leading to unnecessary
duplication of stocks and overheads.
Tighter control of cash should improve profitability, although the chairman
was cautious about the group's full-year results.
Mr Regan is also keen not to take a public view of the share price. 'I want
the market to determine the value of these shares - if I give them all the
facts, they will decide,' he said.
Both Mr Regan's long haul on the trading side and the market's revaluation
exercise could be cut short by a bid from prospective buyers such as Masco,
the US building products group. Mr Regan will contact Masco, but said he did
not expect any prospective bid would match the potential value of the
business.
Meanwhile, the City is left to pick over the lessons of another fallen
favourite. In many ways, Spring Ram was an unlikely go-go stock: no rights
issues, few acquisitions and what was, until recently, believed to be an
ungeared balance sheet. Spring Ram stuck out in one key respect, however:
its apparent ability to defy declining markets.
Yesterday's red ink and resignations thus illustrate one of the stock
market's oldest adages: 'If a thing looks too good to be true, it probably
is.'

Directors said high levels of occupancy and product throughout contributed

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wates City of London in Pounds 24m cash
call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATES CITY of London Properties, which in August reported a pre-tax profits
fall from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 860,000 and a passed dividend for the first
half of 1993, is to raise about Pounds 24m net in a rights issue.
Mr Rodney Clutton, development and property director of the company, all of
whose properties but one fall within the core of the City, said the proceeds
would be used to reduce borrowings 'to a comfortable level'. At June 30 they
stood at Pounds 95m, since when they have been cut by Pounds 12m to Pounds
83m via the sale of Bolsa House, Cheapside.
Wates said that at December 31 1992 gearing was 102 per cent. Adjusting for
the rights proceeds and the Bolsa House sale, pro forma gearing at that same
date would have been about 48 per cent.
Some 34.3m new shares are to be issued at 72p on a 2-for-7 basis. Wates
shares closed down 6p at 82p last night.
The company said that after a long period of decline, there was now evidence
that City property values were stabilising. Mr Clutton said that the rights
issue was so that 'we don't have to sub-optimise and can protect our crown
jewels', especially 100 Old Broad Street and 90 Queen Street.
At the end of 1992, Wates sold 1-6 Milk Street for Pounds 9.35m and 20
Cannon Street for Pounds 14.2m. Mr John Nettleton, finance director, said in
August that these properties were 'over-rented and old', but Mr Clutton said
that more could have been got for them now.
The rights has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. Brokers are
Cazenove and SG Warburg Securities.
COMMENT
There seem to be fewer property purchases than rights issues these days and
with no dividend payments on the horizon, this rescue rights could be seen
as opportunistic. Many analysts harbour suspicions about it. Family and
institutions close to the group have made recent share sales  - indeed the
Wates Foundation sold the second 1.5m tranche of shares this year at the
beginning of September. The success of the rights is assured, but perhaps
this is more to do with the muscle of Cazenove and Warburg than investor
feeling for Wates.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: UniChem advances 43% as operating margins
expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNICHEM, the pharmaceuticals wholesaler and retailer, boosted first half
pre-tax profits by 43 per cent to Pounds 18m after a significant increase in
operating margins and in spite of government constraints on drug pricing.
Sales rose 17 per cent to Pounds 574m and earnings of 8.3p were up 51 per
cent under FRS 3 or up 15.3 per cent before the adjustments.
Operating margin grew from 3.1 per cent to 3.4 per cent.
Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, described the recent decision by the health
secretary to cut 2.5 per cent on average from the price of medicines was
'reasonable, if unwelcome'. 'We are grateful to see some stability come back
to the subscription drugs market,' he said.
He expected this market to grow by about 9 per cent a year. Half the growth
would come from price increases, as more expensive drugs were introduced and
prescribed, and half would come from volume increases.
De-listing of certain drugs that doctors can prescribe would reduce growth
in the market. But there would be an increase in sales of drugs now only
available under prescription which will become more freely available over
the counter.
Gearing was maintained at 17 per cent, up from 9 per cent, in spite of
Pounds 8m spent on expanding the Moss Chemists retail chain.
The largest wholesale division lifted sales by 11.4 per cent but the company
made its fastest progress in the hospital market where sales jumped by 42
per cent to Pounds 20m.
During the period the group bought 34 shops and now has 236 outlets.
While UniChem is a distributor and retailer of drugs, it is included in the
health and household sector and has watched its share price fall in line
with the sector in the last six months.
Analysts forecast full year profits of about Pounds 35.5m, giving a
prospective earnings multiple of about 14, just below the average for the
entire market and below the average for the pharmaceuticals sector.
Mr Harris said he did not understand why UniChem - a distributor of drugs -
was rated like a pharmaceuticals company.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: BM agrees committed loan facility with
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM GROUP, the construction equipment combine which over-extended itself
through acquisition, has signed an agreement with its bankers for a
committed loan facility until the end of 1994.
It has cost Pounds 7m to arrange, and this will be added to exceptional
costs of Pounds 42m already forecast for the 1992-93 accounts.
The financial accounting date is June and results for the year are expected
to be announced in November. Interim pre-tax profits were halved to Pounds
8.6m.
The shares, which peaked at 425p in October 1991, rose 1p to 23 3/4 p.
Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, said the disposal programme was expected
to cut debts, which exceeded Pounds 100m, substantially by the end of 1994.
It was planned to refinance the debt by then on more normal terms. The
restructuring would leave a viable company capable of servicing the reduced
debt, he said. The business plan did not assume an upturn in the economy.
In exchange for the committed facility the group's 12 banks took security
over some of its assets, imposed tighter covenants, and are charging a
higher interest margin.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Auditors resign but vigorously defend role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN formally resigned as auditors to Spring Ram yesterday
following shareholders' concern over the firm's role. Price Waterhouse will
take on the audit.
In an unusually public statement on a client matter, Andersen vigorously
defended its role and stressed that it had served shareholders' best
interests.
'We firmly believe that our role over the past few months has been crucial
in keeping shareholders informed, albeit of certain unwelcome facts,' it
said.
The firm said that it had been responsible for forcing Spring Ram to issue a
profits warning last year which first alerted the City to potential problems
with the accounts.
'The new chairman and finance director have confirmed that their decision to
use another firm to review the interim results bears no reflection on their
regard for Arthur Andersen or for the role we have played,' it said.
It argued that the only changes to pre-tax profits before the year to
January 3 1993 related to changes in accounting policies and practices which
had been fully disclosed in the accounts. It stressed that it had not been
asked to review the interim figures to July 4 last year, which were
substantially amended yesterday.
Mr Martin Towers, the new finance director, said of the Andersen
performance: 'It was not perfect but they were not responsible for the worst
things.'
The Andersen departure is the second high-profile case in recent months of
an auditor resigning from a company after shareholder discontent, while
arguing it had done no wrong.
Touche Ross tendered its resignation earlier this year as auditor to
Trafalgar House following the company's reprimand by the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps boost Tibbett 69% to
Pounds 11.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACQUISITION of Silcock Express last November helped Tibbett &amp; Britten,
the warehousing, transportation and distribution services group, to lift
pre-tax profits by 69 per cent, from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 11.4m, in the
half year to June 26.
Silcock, a car distribution company, contributed Pounds 4m to group
operating profits of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 6.41m), and Pounds 52.6m to total
turnover, which rose 74 per cent to Pounds 176.9m (Pounds 101.6m).
Earnings per share were ahead 42 per cent to 17.5p (12.3p). The interim
dividend is lifted 22 per cent to 4.5p (3.7p).
Mr John Harvey, chairman, said that Silcock had made 'a seamless entry' into
the group. At the same time the rest of the group had continued to show
strong organic growth of Pounds 18m, or 24 per cent of the increase in
turnover.
He described the trading environment as 'still very difficult, particularly
in the automotive sector.' The group profit margin eased from 6.6 per cent
to 6.4 per cent.
The group now operates in five sectors - clothing and textiles, personal
products, food, non-food, and motors. Of these, the non-food division, whose
clients include B&amp;Q and IBM, was the strongest. The clothing and textiles
division continued to be hit by recession.
About 80 per cent of the group's business is contracted. Two contracts - one
for Asda (turnover Pounds 6m) and one for Whitbread (turnover Pounds 12m)
will end in the next six months. Mr Harvey said there was no customer
dissatisfaction in either case.
The international division reported an operating profit of Pounds 200,000
after a previous loss of Pounds 300,000. The acquisition last year of SA
Warehousing Services in South Africa added Pounds 10m to the division's
turnover, helping it to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 2.9m).
Net assets at June 26 were Pounds 74.8m (Pounds 51.4m), and gearing is now
at zero (14 per cent).
COMMENT
The maiden contribution of Silcock Express has transformed the first-half
results in spite of the 17 per cent fall in western European car
registrations in the period. Silcock now accounts for 30 per cent of group
turnover, with the other UK businesses at 60 per cent and the international
division at 10 per cent. The fact that Marks and Spencer, which generated 60
per cent of turnover when the company was floated in 1986, now accounts for
less than 11 per cent is a good illustration of how much Tibbett has grown
and diversified. In addition, it is making strategic moves overseas. The
only real negative news is the loss in the next six months of two contracts.
Perhaps this was behind yesterday's 15p fall in the shares to 715p. Even so,
forecast full-year profits of Pounds 24m to Pounds 25m give a p/e of more
than 19. High, but the shares are worth holding for the benefits that could
follow an upturn in the motor and clothing sectors.

Travelers, the composite insurer hit in recent years by troubled property
investments, at Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.57bn). This would rank it as one of
the largest insurance takeovers in US history.
If completed, the all-share deal would create a financial services group
combining one of the US's biggest insurers with the country's second largest
retail stockbroker, Primerica's Smith Barney Shearson.
The new group, capitalised at more than Dollars 15bn, would be among the
largest financial services companies in the US.
Primerica said it was discussing a possible merger with Travelers under
which it would offer 0.80423 of a share in Primerica for every Travelers
share.
Mr Sanford Weill, chairman, who has built Primerica through takeovers since
the late 1980s into a diversified consumer credit, investment and insurance
group, agreed to pay Dollars 722m for a 27 per cent stake last September.
Since then, he and three other Primerica executives have sat on the
Travelers board and have been instrumental in efforts to sort out the
insurers' finances and operations.
Few analysts yesterday predicted much opportunity for co-operation between
Travelers and existing Primerica operations, though the group could benefit
by selling annuity and other life insurance products through Smith Barney's
10,500 stockbrokers.
However, the combination would bolster Travelers' weak capital position,
helping raise its credit ratings and make it easier to attract investment
funds.
'The combined entity would be well capitalised and would in the long-term
benefit both financially and operationally,' said Mr Lawrence Mayewski,
senior vice-president at AM Best, an insurance rating agency giving the
insurer an A-minus rating.
The deal, which would leave Travelers shareholders with just under a third
of the shares in the new group, was valued at Dollars 5.5bn yesterday as
Primerica's share price rose Dollars 1 1/2 to close at Dollars 47 1/2.
At Dollars 36 5/8, up Dollars 5/8, Travelers shares remained near their high
for the past year, though below the Dollars 37 1/2 value implied by the
Primerica offer.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Spring Ram in board shake-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Spring Ram rose by 7 1/2 p to 68p after the kitchens and bathrooms
group announced a boardroom shake-out and changes in accounting policy which
revealed heavy losses and substantial gearing.
The accounting changes meant Spring Ram declared a pre-tax loss of Pounds
36.4m in the six months to July, compared with a restated profit of Pounds
8.2m. The group, previously always believed to have net cash, also revealed
that it had net debt of Pounds 34.9m, giving gearing of 39 per cent.
Mr Martin Towers, the new finance director, said the previous management had
used 'very aggressive' accounting to maintain Spring Ram's high-growth
record. Taking a more conservative line, the new regime had restated last
year's profits, lowering the half-year total from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds
8.2m and the full-year total from Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 21.1m.
Mr Roger Regan, installed as chairman by disgruntled institutional
investors, yesterday requested and received the resignation of Mr Bill
Rooney, chief executive and founder of the Yorkshire company. Two other
directors also resigned, Mr Ron Farr, chief executive of special products,
and Mr David Riley, chief executive of the bathrooms division.
Mr Regan said the only executive member of the board at the time of his
appointment to remain would be Mr Alan Bell, chief executive of the kitchen
division. Mr Stuart Greenwood resigned as finance director prior to Mr
Regan's arrival.
Asked about compensation for the departing directors, Mr Regan said he
expected to hear from their solicitors, but he would take 'a very hard
line'.
Price Waterhouse, the accountants which carried out a financial review for
Mr Regan, has been appointed as auditors, replacing Arthur Andersen, which
audited Spring Ram's 1992 accounts. Panmure Gordon has been replaced as
stockbroker by de Zoete &amp; Bevan.
Mr Regan said he was 'not in a position to give any indication as to the
result for 1993,' although he was encouraged by the group's robust sales.
He would contact Masco, the US building products group involved in
preliminary discussions with Spring Ram in August about a takeover, to see
if there was a basis for further talks.
Losses per share of 10.9p compared with restated earnings of 0.7p. The
interim dividend was passed.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Mersey Docks buys Kent port: Medway sold for Pounds 104m -
nearly three times the buy-out price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERSEY Docks and Harbour Company yesterday clinched its purchase of Medway
Ports for Pounds 103.7m, only 18 months after Medway was bought for Pounds
37m by management and employees.
The acquisition, which gives it a deepwater port in south-eastern England to
complement its Liverpool docks, will be funded in part by a two-for-five
rights issue to raise Pounds 76.6m. It is offering 24m shares at 330p
against a closing price last night of 376p, up 1p.
The near tripling in value of Medway, a trust port until its privatisation
in March 1992, reflects large cost savings achieved by the management. It
has halved the workforce from 600 at privatisation and introduced new
working practices.
Some 270 of its 300 dockers took redundancy late last year. Medway now
employs 100 dockers, bringing in contractors employed by other stevedoring
companies for specialist work when required. The cut in costs contributed to
a leap in operating profits to Pounds 4.5m for the first six months of this
year on turnover of Pounds 17.2m, compared with Pounds 3.5m for Medway's
first 10 months last year as a private company.
The agreed offer values Medway's ordinary shares at Pounds 32.82 each for a
total of Pounds 65.8m. Shareholders will also receive Pounds 4.43 a share in
dividends for a total of Pounds 37.25. Management and employees were granted
shares and bought more at Pounds 1 each to help fund their buyout.
Mersey Docks is also buying Pounds 15m of preference shares and taking on
Medway's net indebtedness of Pounds 22.9m.
Sheerness is Medway's main port, specialising in cars, fruit, timber and
paper. Mersey Docks specialises in containers, forest products, grain, scrap
metal and oil, so the two can have complementary marketing strategies.
Medway, which is forecasting minimum operating profits of Pounds 10.1m this
year, had a net asset value of Pounds 20.4m in June. It said yesterday it
intended to exercise a Pounds 2.25m option before September 30 to acquire
the freehold interest in the former Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham. The
property has considerable development potential.
Mersey Docks, which says the takeover should enhance earnings next year, is
forecasting pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 19m this year, compared with
Pounds 15.2m, and a final dividend of 6.15p to give a total of 9p - a 20 per
cent increase.
Through a tough policy on labour practices, management at Mersey Docks, like
its counterparts at Medway Ports, has revitalised the company. Freight
volumes through Liverpool now match the peak volumes of the 1950s and 1960s.
The UK government - Mersey Docks' biggest shareholder with 20 per cent  -
will not be taking up its rights. The government announced several years ago
it would sell its holding when market conditions were right, but not this
year.
The Pounds 37m privatisation of Medway Ports was financed by Pounds 20m of
loans, Pounds 15m of preference shares and Pounds 2m of equity at Pounds 1 a
share, giving employees and management a 51 per cent stake. The company then
had Pounds 17m debt.
The management bid, the only one left after two others dropped out, was just
below the formula set by the government for the privatisation process,
attracting criticism.
The leaders of the buy-out will benefit most from the takeover, with Mr
Peter Vincent, Medway's chief executive, making Pounds 12m and four other
directors Pounds 8m each. They are taking a third of their benefits in
Mersey Docks shares.
Mr Trevor Furlong, Mersey chief executive, will become Medway's chairman. Mr
Vincent will become a Mersey Docks director.
The rights issue is fully underwritten by Robert Fleming.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Recovery at Next continues with Pounds 23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT, the fashion retailer that was an icon of the 1980s but came close to
collapse at the end of the decade, continued its strong recovery yesterday,
almost tripling interim profits from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 23m.
The pre-tax figures for the six months to July 31 outstripped analysts'
forecasts of about Pounds 18m, and the shares increased 4 1/2 p to 208 1/2
p.
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said the improvement stemmed from better
product quality and customer service as well as greater efficiency and lower
mark-downs.
Next has also broadened its customer appeal, retreating from the high
fashion territory it strayed into during the 1980s. It now aims to provide
'good-taste, good-quality' products that are fashionable but durable.
Lord Wolfson, chairman, said Next was no longer targeted at '25-year-old
Porsche-driving yuppies', but at 'people who want a wardrobe which will last
and not go out of fashion within months'.
It has unified products across the high street and mail order divisions,
leading to cost savings through bulk buying.
Total turnover rose 9.6 per cent to Pounds 233.2m, while the high street
stores increased sales 16.2 per cent to Pounds 160.9m, from 1.8 per cent
less selling space. Next Directory, the catalogue division, lifted sales 8.8
per cent to Pounds 46.5m. Next said current trading at both divisions was up
10 per cent.
The credit operation Club 24 increased the contribution from its ongoing
business from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.6m, with a further Pounds 3.3m profit
(from a Pounds 2.2m loss) arising from debt collection by its third-party
debt funding business, which is being wound down.
Next shrunk from 305 to 298 stores, but has now finished its rationalisation
programme. Selling space may increase marginally, but the company believes
it is close to the natural limit for profitable stores in the UK.
Lord Wolfson said there was still considerable scope to improve the trading
performance and it did not intend to rush into expansion or diversification.
The company has opened one experimental store in the US: start-up costs of
Pounds 1.1m were charged to the interim accounts.
The dividend was tripled to 1.5p. Earnings per share increased to 5.5p from
2p.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Thorn EMI falls on fears of US rental curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Thorn EMI fell 11p to 977p yesterday on fears that profits could
be hit by possible US legislation aimed at curbing the behaviour of staff at
its American rental subsidiary.
The possibility of US legislation on the rental of white goods, furniture
and jewellery was raised by a report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal
alleging that Thorn employees used intimidatory tactics when carrying out
repossessions.
Thorn EMI, whose interests include music and electronics, said last night
that the claims would be investigated. It added: 'Thorn EMI is in discussion
with its US management about the allegations, which are being taken
seriously.'
Another contention was that customers taking advantage of rent-to-own offers
at Thorn's Rent-A-Center stores in the US ended up paying far more for goods
than if they had bought them at the retail price.
The report was largely based on evidence from former employees, some of whom
had been dismissed by the group.
Some analysts defended Thorn, saying the US rental business provided an
opportunity for poor consumers, with no credit rating, to acquire goods such
as television sets, refrigerators and jewellery. One analyst said it was not
surprising that a rental business operating in depressed areas of the US
resorted to rough tactics for repossessions.
Several analysts said, however, that the publicity could only harm the group
and that legislation aimed at curbing the rent-to-own sector could damage
Thorn's profits.
Rental provided Thorn with 30 per cent of its Pounds 379.3m operating profit
in the year to March 31. The company is believed to have earned about 40 per
cent of its rental operating profit in the US.
Analysts are worried by reports that Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the
House of Representatives Banking Committee, intends to introduce a bill next
week classifying rent-to-own arrangements as credit sales. This could limit
the credit Thorn's US rental business could charge. The committee, however,
has been preoccupied with consumer protection against insurance companies
and it is unclear how quickly the rent-to-own bill might move forward.
Mr Hamish Dickson, an analyst at Hoare Govett, said he did not think the
chances of federal legislation on rental were high. But, if legislation were
introduced, 'my suspicion is that it would make it difficult to run the
business'.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Bank chief backs move to cut EC currency role: Governor
rejects exchange rate controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday threw his weight
behind UK government efforts to scale down the European Community's
ambitions in economic and monetary co-operation.
Europe, he said, could return to currency stability through relatively
modest arrangements organised by individual countries aimed at keeping
inflation low.
Mr George also rejected suggestions by Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission's president, that the continent should reintroduce exchange rate
controls to curb the huge currency flows that precipitated a succession of
ERM crises in the past year. The governor's comments in a speech in London
mark an attempt to fill the policy vacuum in European monetary affairs after
last month's virtual collapse of the exchange rate mechanism.
Addressing the American Chamber of Commerce, Mr George indicated that other
European nations could emulate Britain by introducing domestic inflation
targets in place of fixed exchange-rate linkages.
He was speaking as news emerged of a big narrowing of the UK's trade deficit
with non-EC countries since Britain left the ERM a year ago.
Mr George said any new monetary arrangements devised in the wake of last
month's ERM debacle would have to allow 'each country to pursue (its)
stability objective in its own way, taking account of its national
circumstances'.
The governor's remarks reflect the widespread scepticism across Europe that
the continent is ready for any imminent return to the old 'hard' version of
the ERM based on keeping currencies closely tied to the D-Mark.
While national inflation targets would provide clear benchmarks for national
policy, he suggested Europe could retain a semblance of monetary
co-operation by monitoring these targets across the continent.
Mr George appears to think that the European Monetary Institute - a body to
be set up next year in place of the existing committee of EC central bank
governors - could take on this job.
He said 'an explicit commitment to achieve price stability in the medium
term' across Europe would gradually help in the important goal of reducing
big exchange rate movements among European currencies. Currency stability
was vital in the long term since without this free trade would be impeded.
However it was important to bring down inflation across the continent well
before any effort to reintroduce the original form of the ERM, which was
dramatically modified last month by allowing currencies to fluctuate by wide
15 per cent margins, rather than the old 2.25 per cent limits.

FT  23 SEP 93 / China says Hurd's Olympic attack may harm relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MONTE CARLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA gave a veiled warning yesterday that an attack by Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, on Beijing's suitability as a site for the 2000 Olympics
might further harm Sino-British relations.
The International Olympic Committee will choose from five contenders for the
site tonight, with Beijing still the favourite.
Meanwhile, Mr Hurd said he would meet Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign
minister, in New York on October 1 to try to speed up talks over Hong Kong.
In Monaco Mr Li Lanqing, a Chinese vice-premier, said: 'We feel astonishment
and regret at Mr Hurd's remarks.' Mr Hurd had implied on Australian
television that Beijing did not deserve to host the games because of its
poor human rights record.
Mr Li, a former trade minister, said: 'This is politics and I believe that
sport and politics should not be mixed.' He went on to caution: 'The
improvement of bilateral relations depends on the efforts of both sides.'
Without being prompted, he raised the question of the future of Hong Kong,
saying in a clear linkage of the two issues: 'China is sincere in all its
talks with Britain. We would like to see a fair and equitable settlement of
the question of Hong Kong.'
Sydney, Manchester, Berlin and Istanbul are also competing to host the
millennial Olympiad. Two prime ministers - Mr Paul Keating of Australia and
Mrs Tansu Ciller of Turkey, arrived yesterday to reinforce the final bid
presentations to the IOC today.
Mr John Major will fly in from his Far East tour this morning. Manchester
and Beijing each flew in dozens of children to provide street performances.
The five contenders are together estimated to have spent well over Dollars
125m (Pounds 81m) on campaigns.
Mr Li said if China won, Beijing would seek IOC permission to hold sections
of the games in Hong Kong and possibly Macao.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Smith to appeal to delegates over vote reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH will next week raise the stakes in his battle to democratise
Labour's selection of parliamentary candidates by making a personal appeal
to delegates at the party's annual conference to back his plans.
In a highly unusual move, the Labour leader will open next Wednesday's
crucial debate on the proposed reforms less than 24 hours after delivering
his set-piece address.
The decision underlines the degree to which Mr Smith's personal authority is
riding on the party's acceptance of the proposals, which are opposed by some
large Labour-affiliated unions.
Mr Smith explained the move by saying: 'I have played a leading part in
constructing these changes . . . I therefore think it is right that I should
put the case to conference.'
The outcome of next week's vote looks too close to call, with Mr Smith
having seemingly improved his chances of winning with his staunchly
pro-union speech to the TUC conference earlier this month. The issue is set
to dominate the Labour conference, which begins in Brighton on Sunday.
Mr Smith's plan, watered down to overcome union resistance, is for
candidates to be elected by constituency members on the basis of
one-member-one-vote.
The unions would lose their right to influence selection, but union members
would be able to vote as individuals by paying a reduced party membership
fee in the constituency where they live.
Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, hinted yesterday that the
ruling national executive committee might move to impose Mr Smith's plan -
which it has approved - if delegates rejected it along with amendments
proposed by critics.
Questioned on what would happen if the proposals failed to attract a
majority vote, he replied: 'As you will know, the NEC has extensive powers.
We are assuming the NEC's proposals will go through,' he said.
Imposing the plan in this way would allow Mr Smith to claim only a hollow
victory, since it would cast doubt on his ability to exercise effective
control.
The NEC also drew up a statement yesterday which - if approved by conference
 -would commit the next Labour government to holding a referendum on
electoral reform after an initial consultation period.
Senior officials yesterday denied Mr Smith was taking a risk by making such
a personal appeal. Officials said 60 to 70 per cent of constituency parties
questioned had indicated support for Mr Smith's position.

The political crisis in Moscow is causing much less worry in currency
markets than the attempted coup of 1991. It would be gratifying if this were
because the money movers have seen the limited relevance of an economy which
accounts for barely 3 per cent of global output. The stock arguments for
marking down the D-Mark in response to Russian uncertainty - the risk to
German exports and of loan losses at banks - sound hollow. The banks are
well provided against loss on any loans which are not already covered by
export credit guarantees; trade with Russia dwindled long ago.
The brief downward lurch of the D-Mark may thus turn out to have been a
buying opportunity. Certainly it offered France and other ERM countries a
chance to rebuild their foreign exchange reserves on the cheap. Such
purchases may continue to underpin the D-Mark for a while yet. So should the
wide differential between German and US interest rates.
This is not to deny the psychological impact of the leadership battle in
Moscow. Doubtless any violence which raised the spectre of mass westward
emigration would send the dollar soaring again against the D-Mark. Arguably,
too, German equities are vulnerable to correction with the DAX index at
nearly 1,900. Their relative slowness to recover yesterday morning's losses
suggests the market is still sensitive to the possibility of bad news. The
dollar's longer-term recovery still depends, though, on robust economic
growth in the US - and that is still far from being an established fact.

FT  23 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something perverse about a mobile phone which is designed to be
used at home. That seems to be the logic of Vodafone's new MetroDigital
service which has been launched to rival Mercury's One-2-One. Vodafone is
inviting users to nominate a home cell - some of which in London seem barely
bigger than a broom cupboard - and calls within the home cell will be much
cheaper than those made outside. By limiting the usefulness of the system's
mobility Vodafone is trying both to tackle the cheapness and appeal of
One-2-One while protecting the very high profitability of its national
analogue network.
Its offer, however, lacks the simplicity and marketing appeal of One-2-One's
headline-grabbing launch. Consumers already bemused by the technology may
thus shy away from this overly fussy idea. Perhaps that is part of the idea.
Vodafone's main interest must be in the pan-European Euro-Digital system, on
which MetroDigital is piggy-backed. To the extent that MetroDigital muddies
the waters on pricing perception and spoils the impact of One-2-One it will
help Vodafone's cause.
Consumers may, however, be deterred by Vodafone's use of third party
salesmen while One-2-One is sold directly by Mercury. Yet if the initial
enthusiastic response to One-2-One is any guide, there is a large potential
market out there. Whether Vodafone can capture enough of that to offset the
erosion of its excessive margins on the existing analogue network is more
doubtful.

FT  23 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The amazing saga of Spring Ram's disappearing profits shows just how supple
the phrase 'true and fair view' can be. The largest restatement of Spring
Ram's figures relates to the unaudited first half figures for 1992.
Nonetheless the adoption of different accounting policies by the
level-headed new board has lowered 1992's audited full year figures by some
20 per cent. Some of the previous policies accepted by the auditors Arthur
Andersen - most notably the depreciation rates which were related to the
degree of use of the factories - border on the bizarre. And auditors who are
being pressed too hard by managements to accept aggressive accounting
techniques can always resign. Some lessons are easily drawn. The abuse of
half year figures suggests they should be subject to some kind of scrutiny.
Perhaps audit partners should be rotated more rapidly so that a fresh pair
of eyes is always on the job. Non-executive directors, significantly absent
in Spring Ram's case, are a useful conduit through which auditors can
express any qualms.
Whatever the accounting worries this was at least a partial victory for
corporate governance. The campaign led by the Prudential deserves applause
since it may have rescued a viable business before it slumped into
irretrievable financial problems. Underlying it all, though, remains the
fear that published accounts offer very little defence if a company is
determined to see life through a rose-coloured profit and loss account.

FT  23 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Tapping a liquid market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the dogs which have failed to bark this year, the feared shortage of
institutional cash is the most noticeable by its absence. With the stock
market near record levels, it is difficult to argue that funding the public
sector borrowing requirement has sucked the life blood of liquidity from
equities. Unit trust sales are running at Pounds 1bn a month - and portfolio
investment from overseas at four times that amount - so it is clear where
the transfusion has come from. The worry is that neither source can be
relied upon for support should the going get tough.
True, yesterday's CSO figures show UK institutional cash flow on a rising
trend. Pension funds in particular will have more to invest as contribution
holidays come to an end. The one-off costs associated with early retirement
should also diminish as companies emerge from recession. It comes as no
surprise that investment by pension funds was lowest in the dark days of
last summer. Life companies will have plenty of free cash so long as sales
of single premium investment products remain strong.
Even so, UK institutions cannot meet the funding requirements of both
companies and government single-handed. Their holdings of cash and overseas
bonds have already been run down in favour of equities and gilts. UK
financial assets will simply have to be priced to attract overseas buyers.
The lion's share of foreign investment goes into fixed-interest securities,
so gilts are most likely to take the strain. The widening of the yield
differential between gilts and German government bonds ahead of next week's
auction suggests the market knows as much.

BRITISH COMPANIES are negotiating contracts worth up to Pounds 1bn in
Malaysia which could secure 25,000 jobs in the UK, Mr John Major announced
yesterday.
Speaking in Kuala Lumpur before flying to Monte Carlo, the prime minister
said British companies had won a number of multi-million pound projects,
ranging from airport construction to bus manufacturing, and were involved in
'potentially hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts'.
During visits to Japan and Malaysia Mr Major had been unable to escape
domestic political concerns, and it was with obvious relief that he was able
to announce substantial overseas contracts for British companies. British
Gas and Genting Sanyen of Malaysia are to build a 720MW power station under
the country's electricity privatisation programme. The total cost of the
project is put at Pounds 550m. British Gas will take a 20 per cent equity
stake in the project.
An Anglo-Japanese consortium made up of Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty,
Gammon, G-Mats (part of GEC) and Marubeni of Japan have signed a memorandum
of understanding for the development and project management of a new
international airport for Kuala Lumpur.
The total cost of the project is put at MDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 3.5bn).
Those involved say British companies are well placed to win hundreds of
millions of pounds worth of contracts for work on the airport. Trafalgar
House is also to invest about Pounds 13m in a steel fabrication plant in
Malaysia.
The engineering company John Brown, part of the Trafalgar House group, has
won a Pounds 120m turnkey contract to build a 330MW power station on the
outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. John Brown is already involved in the
construction of a 220MW power plant in the south of Malaysia.
Dennis, the British heavy vehicle and bus manufacturer, is forming a joint
venture to manufacture its vehicles in Malaysia.

A London banker on the phone to a senior treasury dealer in Moscow yesterday
was discussing a series of bonds the Vnesheconombank (foreign economic
affairs bank) plans to issue later this year. The bonds are in favour of CIS
enterprises whose accounts the bank froze almost two years ago and some
international financial institutions are apparently eager to trade these
rather dubious bits of paper. Hence the disappointment of the banker in
question on being informed that settlement and registration details had
still not been finalised. 'In any event,' the dealer explained, 'we have to
clear our long position in presidents before anything is decided about the
bonds.'

Anglo-French rivalries have flared up again - this time over the vexed issue
of EC airline subsidies. At an EC hearing in Brussels last week on
allegations of unfair infusion of public money into the airline business,
Bernard Attali, the chairman of Air France, upset Sir Michael Bishop,
chairman of British Midland, by insisting on speaking in French. Sir Michael
 -a persistent critic of government bale-outs for loss-makers in the air -
insisted that this breached an informal agreement that participants would
speak English. This, says non-linguist Sir Michael, is to save the cost of
interpreters.
Unfortunately, Bernard's adherence to French meant that Sir Michael didn't
know whether the Air France boss was for or against British Midland's line
on subsidies. 'I have a feeling, however,' he adds, 'that he may not have
been on our side.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major may have been tucked away in Kuala Lumpur when Russia descended
into turmoil - but he still managed to trump other western leaders as the
first to back President Boris Yeltsin with a statesmanlike, even eloquent,
response.
Back in London, the Foreign Office is crowing with delight - and not
backward in claiming much of the credit. For it appears that Major's
statements were the product of labours into the wee hours by Whitehall's two
top Russia experts - the 'two Rods' - who were on the PM's Asian trip.
Foreign policy adviser Sir Rodric Braithwaite returned to London only last
year after four years as ambassador to Russia, while Roderic Lyne, one of
Major's private secretaries, was head of what was then the Soviet department
of the FCO between 1990 and 1992.
The PM, who has recklessly promised to dispense with speech-writers for the
party conference, might at least ponder the value of shrewd advice.

The latest victim of hubris, the pride that comes before a fall, is
Britain's Liberal Democrat party.
Boasting of its high place in national attention, its president Charles
Kennedy cited as evidence that more top newspapers' political editors had
gone to the party's Torquay conference than had opted to accompany John
Major to Tokyo. That was on Monday.
Alas, today, by the time party leader Paddy Ashdown rises to make his big
speech, many if not most of the said high hacks will be gone elsewhere. So,
moreover, will be one of the Lib Dems' grade-1 eggheads, Lord Holme -
although he, at least, isn't being drawn away by rival political
attractions.
He is jetting out of Torquay
to Prague for the opening of
an English college for Czech
students.

Impoverished east Germans tuned into Norddeutscher Rundfunk radio station
yesterday to hear the cheerful tidings that the 46 directors of the Treuhand
agency were allegedly earning DM379,000 apiece, just DM51,000 less than
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
At DM242,000 with cars and housing thrown in, the 135 heads of department
are apparently not exactly on the breadline either.
In the popular mind, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring
east German industry goes down as the fons et origo of almost every
conceivable economic ill in the region.
In fact, its officials work incredibly long hours, putting up with all
manner of criticism, particularly should they appear to be flogging cheap
east German enterprises to their plutocratic western friends.
But tell that to the average citizen, let alone the 35 per cent of the
labour force that are either without work or on job creation schemes.
No doubt relieved that the end of its task is in sight - the agency is due
to be wound up some time in the middle of next year - the Treuhand
spluttered yesterday how it was 'totally incomprehensible why NDR has
released these sorts of figures which are simply not right'.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Personal View: Late payers should pay the price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Lord ALEXANDER OF WEEDON QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to review how UK industry, and especially small business,
is financed. There is one important and simple step that could be taken
immediately. It needs to ensure that commercial debts are paid on time.
Because late payment of debt is so entrenched in British culture, this can
only be achieved by reform of the law to provide for a statutory right of
interest on overdue business debts. Such reform would contribute to
investment, expansion and job creation.
The problem has existed throughout my working life. In my early days at the
Bar, actions for the recovery of debt formed part of my livelihood. From the
moment I joined National Westminster Bank, our business units in all parts
of the country have consistently told me of the havoc which the virus of
late payment has caused many medium-sized and small businesses throughout
the recession.
Research has confirmed these reports. One recent study told us that at any
one time at least Pounds 15bn-worth of trade debts to small and medium-sized
businesses were overdue. This translates into a daily additional interest
charge of more than Pounds 4m.
The problem seems a peculiarly British one. Many other countries already
provide an automatic right to interest on overdue payments. A recent study
revealed that payments in Germany are on average made two and a half times
more promptly than in the UK.
The present state of British law makes no sense. If a business chasing a
debt commences legal proceedings, a right to interest then dates back to the
date on which payment was due. But without legal proceedings, in the absence
of a specific contractual term, there is no such right. It is now 100 years
since the judges of the House of Lords suggested legislation could be
enacted to remove this anomaly. Judges have rightly described the present
law as unjust.
The problem hits small businesses hardest. These businesses account for 17
per cent of gross domestic product. Perhaps even more significantly, they
provide 35 per cent of private sector employment. They are, despite the
effects of the recession, a dynamic sector of the economy which we must
foster during the recovery.
Small businesses are more heavily dependent than large ones on borrowing to
finance working capital. They have a minimum of administration, and the
burden of chasing late payment is a distraction for management. Sometimes
they are part of a vicious circle, forced to pay late because they are not
being paid by their customers.
Government and industry acknowledge the problem. In the last Budget it was
proposed that public companies should disclose their payment terms in their
accounts. The Confederation of British Industry introduced its payment code
more than a year ago, yet still many businesses and, indeed, sometimes
central and local government, fail to comply properly with their contractual
obligations.
I believe the root cause of the problem is cultural. Too many businesses
consider it acceptable, and some even consider it astute practice, not to
pay their bills on time. Lack of sanction against conduct of this kind
positively encourages such behaviour.
I sense a wider recognition that legislation is now needed to change the
culture. More business groups, such as the Forum for Private Business, are
arguing for a right of interest, and an increasing number of banks supports
the idea. A recent cross-party survey of MPs suggested that 83 per cent
thought the time had come for a statutory right to interest on debts paid
late.
What are the objections? Some say there is no point in encouraging
litigation or clogging up the courts. I do not see this as a likely effect
of any change. What it would do, as has legislation in the equal
opportunities and race relations fields, is give a strong impetus to a
change in culture. An automatic right to interest would act as a practical
disincentive to late payment.
It is sometimes also said that dominant purchasers would respond by
extending the credit period. Some might try to, but if large suppliers
adopted this cynical tactic, adverse publicity would quickly flow. Neither
would compliance impose an inappropriate burden on business. Only those that
failed to honour their obligations would suffer a cost.
Such a law could operate simply and clearly. There is a clear precedent in
the Inland Revenue's right to interest on overdue tax. There is surely the
same basic fairness in ensuring contractual debts due to businesses are paid
on time or, if not, that compensation is made.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Nafta passage in peril
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK President Bill Clinton launched his campaign for ratification of
the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), with a finely choreographed
event involving three ex-presidents and a speech that rose magnificently to
the occasion. Here was a Democratic president, leader of the party within
which most resistance to the agreement can be found, setting out firmly and
clearly the reasons why that resistance is so utterly wrong-headed. At last,
one felt listening to him, the administration is going to give this issue
the priority it needs.
Yet by the end of the week the presidential propaganda machine had already
moved on to beat the drums for healthcare reform. That is an important
issue, but unlikely to reach decision point before mid-1994 at the earliest.
By contrast a decision on Nafta is needed by the end of this year, and as
things stand the decision is more than likely to go against it. One speech
is certainly not enough to undo the damage done by Mr Ross Perot in whipping
up hysteria on the issue.
Precious time was lost between Mr Clinton's inauguration last January and
the signing in mid-August of 'side agreements' on labour and the
environment, which he had promised to secure during his election campaign.
From a strict free trade point of view, these agreements actually reduce the
attraction of Nafta, since they forbid further unilateral deregulation in
these areas by any of the three signatories (Canada, Mexico and the US).
Worrying parallels
The object of the side agreements is, of course, to pacify powerful lobbies
in the US, whose anxieties Mr Clinton shares or at least claims to share.
The exercise is similar to the 'clarification' of the Blair House agreement
on agricultural trade, which the EC has now agreed to seek in order to save
the French government from the wrath of its farm lobby. Indeed there is a
worrying parallelism between the US attitude to Nafta and the French
attitude to Blair House: both have come to be seen as symbolising all the
demons that threaten national living standards and a cherished way of life,
although in both cases the likely economic effect is quite small.
It would be helpful if all discussion of Nafta in the US began with a
reminder that the whole Mexican economy is no bigger than the amount by
which the US economy grows in two average years, and then proceeded to point
out that US imports from Mexico are already virtually unrestricted. The next
point to note is that, even without Nafta, deregulation in Mexico has
already turned a US deficit on bilateral trade of Dollars 5.7bn in 1987 into
a Dollars 5.6bn US surplus in 1992. The 'giant sucking sound' of jobs moving
south, with which Mr Perot has terrorised American workers, should be
drowned, in any rational universe, by the noise of new factories being built
in the US to supply the Mexican market.
Strategic centrepiece
Nafta is not a zero-sum game. It should result in a net increase in
employment on both sides of the Rio Grande (and indeed of the 49th
parallel). But, while the short-term gains might well be greater in the US,
the agreement's political importance to Mexico can hardly be exaggerated.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has made Nafta the centrepiece of his
liberalising strategy, which reverses all 20th-century Mexican traditions
and is still bitterly contested both outside and (more discreetly but also
more dangerously) inside the ruling party. US rejection is likely to derail
this strategy. That should be a matter of acute concern to Americans, right
across the political spectrum. The last thing the US needs is a southern
neighbour sinking back into economic stagnation and political instability,
from which ever growing numbers would flee northward.
Republican congressmen and senators should not let partisan feeling, or
dislike of the side agreements, dissuade them from voting for an agreement
which remains a great achievement of their party. Mr Clinton, for his part,
must not fall into the trap of thinking that, having at last made his own
position clear, he can now afford to move on to other issues. This one
requires all his persuasive powers, and if it goes wrong it will be a sad
victory for the forces of irrationalism, leaving little hope that the US
will grasp the more difficult nettles of freer trade with Europe and Asia.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Days of whine and poses: Yeltsin and Rutskoi are staking out
their positions in a gamble to wrest control of Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the next few days are calm', said Mr Yegor Gaidar, now back as first
deputy prime minister with a presidential 'coup' in his in-tray as well as
an economic crisis, 'and there are no confrontations, then the situation
should stabilise'.
Day one of direct presidential rule has gone to Mr Boris Yeltsin. After the
grand theatre of the swearing-in of General Alexander Rutskoi as acting
president in the Russian parliament early yesterday, an anticlimax was
palpable. The military pledged continuing support to the president: General
Pavel Grachev, the defence minister - not an enthusiast for Mr Yeltsin's
decision - assured him of the 'full' support of the armed forces; General
Valery Mironov, the deputy defence minister, speaking in the General Staff
academy, said he had spent Tuesday night calling regional commanders, to
find that 'most' serving officers viewed politics as something to avoid. But
to be safe, he had banned all political meetings in army units, and believed
his orders were being obeyed.
There are demonstrations, but they are small. The parliament's supporters
gathered outside the White House are elderly, or young-thuggish, or drunk,
or a little daft: there are few respectable citizens and almost no
enthusiastic youth, as there were, in large numbers, on the days and nights
of the August coup in 1991. The cabinet of ministers has suffered only one
defection - Mr Sergei Glaziev, the young minister for foreign economic
affairs - who, colleagues said, had wanted to go primarily because he could
not work with Mr Gaidar, and not because of his stated reason that he could
not accede to the president's decree.
In the regions, most administration leaders and even some heads of local
soviets (councils) are voicing support for Mr Yeltsin. It is often lukewarm:
Mr Boris Nemtsov, the reformist governor of the industrially important
Nizhny Novgorod region, said local people had better things to do than worry
about what was happening in Moscow. No matter (for Mr Yeltsin) -
indifference is fine, only active opposition need worry him.
Mr Yeltsin has a plan for 'step by step' reform, which is beginning to be
set in train. Elections are to be called for the new parliament on December
11-12: the country will be governed by presidential decree and government
decisions for the next eleven and a half weeks. During that time, the
standing constitutional convention will be convened to discuss and pass Mr
Yeltsin's variant of the constitution - which, once agreed, will be put to
the newly elected parliament for approval as its first duty.
Parliamentary commissions organised by the government (constitutionally,
commissions have fallen under the jurisdiction of the parliament) are now
being set up with the assistance of the regional administrations - who were
told yesterday by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, that their
leaders would be held personally responsible for carrying out the decree Mr
Yeltsin signed last night.
Elections will take place only to the lower house of the new Federal
Assembly - that house to be known as the State Duma. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko,
also brought back in his former role of first deputy prime minister, said
yesterday it had been decided that 270 of its 400 deputies would be elected
from single member constituencies, with a further 130 elected by party
lists. This last measure will give fledgling parties a role, and a lever for
exerting party discipline.
The upper house, or Council of the Federation, will not initially be
elected. It has already been created as a standing advisory body, and is and
will be composed of the leaders of the regional and republican
administrations and soviets - thus being transformed into the senior
legislative chamber. Pressed for his view, Mr Gaidar said yesterday that he
expected this body would in the course of next year also be elected - and
that there would be presidential elections, as Mr Yeltsin has indicated, in
that period. 'It is step by step, step by step,' Mr Gaidar repeated.
Three main dangers confront Mr Yeltsin and his government in the weeks
ahead, before elections allow the people to speak. First, that Mr Yeltsin,
as was his wont after the August 1991 coup and again after the April 1993
referendum, may fritter away his advantage in inactivity and unfocused
activity. He has prepared relatively carefully for this juncture - making
sure of the allegiance of the armed forces, progressively diminishing his
vice-president, and last week bringing back Mr Gaidar. He must now push
through action on every front - political and economic especially, but also
on what might be called the public relations level, appearing as the relaxed
and paternal president who offers no threat to anyone except the malevolent.
(He did some of this yesterday, with a little walkabout through central
Moscow with his interior minister, Mr Viktor Yerin, in tow.) His health and
his attention must both hold steady - and most of all, his will.
Second, he may act, but wrongly. He is no economist: though understanding
the difficulties and prepared to address them, he is also a populist by
instinct and prone to throw money at problems. Mr Gaidar observed yesterday
that a pre-election period was not the most promising time to expect
discipline in economic matters. Mr Yeltsin - and his political advisers -
will find their sense of what is economically right severely tested in the
weeks ahead as they seek to have elected a parliament which will find their
policies acceptable.
Third, and most seriously, Mr Yeltsin may act, and act wisely - but in doing
so store up such a pressure of protest as to threaten his own position and
that of the government. Parliament was more than inconvenient for him - it
posed a direct challenge to his authority and to his decisions. It could
hardly be otherwise in a political system where the division of powers was
not defined and the natural belief of many, perhaps most, of the deputies
was in the necessity for the state to intervene, to plan and to control, in
order to address the problems about which their constituents complained and
which they themselves could so clearly see about them.
Parliament was a great, even threatening, pain and obstruction, but it was a
vent to opposition and to grievance. Its abolition - or rather, its
transformation into a parallel power - could give grievances that have
remained rhetorical so far a militant, even armed, character. There were
uniformed men toting Kalashnikovs in the White House yesterday, and Russian
reporters said that plainclothed young men were carrying them last night.
Gen Rutskoi has appointed three anti-Yeltsinites to the posts of ministers
of defence, security and interior. His defence minister, General Vladislav
Achalov, ordered military cadets with side-arms to report to the parliament
to protect it and was thwarted by Gen Grachev - but will presumably try
again, as will his colleagues, to give their paper authority real weight.
A package of economic measures is being prepared by the government: if these
are to address the central problem of inflation, they will mean cuts in the
budget, and thus in social programmes, and in funding to enterprises. None
will be without social costs. If they are to be pushed through before the
election - Mr Yeltsin and his government may decide to hold off in this
period - there will be real, legitimate grievances to deal with. But how?
How tolerant can even a temporary autocrat be? How far can he discriminate
between grievance and attempts to destabilise, even overthrow him? And how
far can he count on moderation from leaders of nationalist and communist
groups who have nothing to gain from acquiescence to his will?
Day one of this new and febrile era may thus be a harbinger of a relatively
peaceful transition period to real elections - or a pause before the
opposition forces, which include Gen Rutskoi, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary speaker, Mr Vladimir Isakov and Mr Sergei Baburin, leaders of
the communist-nationalist movements, and others who are energetic,
resourceful and do not lack allies, make their plans and whip up organised
revolt on the fertile soil which an impoverished and fearful population
offers. Mr Yeltsin, against the judgment of many in his entourage, has made
a break for a new order: the old one is far from dead.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Slippery art of central banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE THIS scene: US Federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, Bundesbank
president-elect Hans Tietmeyer and Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno,
huddled together this week in a Washington bar, taking a break from a gloomy
International Monetary Fund meeting to compare notes on the art of
modern-day central banking. Pleasantries dispensed with, drinks ordered, the
conversation would turn quickly to a three-way moan. Never has the art of
central banking been so difficult.
Mr Greenspan probably has the most delicate task at present: to decide when
to raise US interest rates. Some observers argue that the weak US recovery,
and the sluggish rate of broad money growth, argue for delay. Others,
notably the monetarist Shadow Open Market Committee, fear that double-digit
growth of narrow money spells inflationary danger and want higher rates now.
In Japan, life is a little easier. All the indicators - falling output,
sluggish credit growth, and a badly damaged banking sector - argue for a
loose monetary policy, hence Tuesday's 0.75 percentage point cut in the
discount rate to a record low. But Germany's situation is again more
complicated: rapid broad money growth argues for a tight monetary policy,
but almost every other indicator says that this policy is feeding Germany's
lingering recession.
Erratic behaviour
All three central bankers are trying to make policy at a time of exceptional
uncertainty in the world economy. Forecasters have consistently missed the
strength of world deflationary pressures; analysts have therefore failed to
spot how low short-term interest rates would need to go in the US and Japan,
or the way in which this fall in the return on cash would feed stock and
bond market rallies; and economists have failed to explain the erratic
behaviour of monetary aggregates, both in the US and Germany.
The normal indicators upon which monetary policymakers rely are, as a
result, difficult to understand, let alone use as reliable guides to
policymaking. Should Mr Greenspan worry about narrow or broad money growth?
How far can estimated real interest rates guide future policy? Does the bond
market rally mean that inflation is under control, or that these markets are
heading for a fall? Why does the yen fall against the dollar when the Bank
of Japan cuts interest rates, but the D-Mark rise when the Bundesbank does
the same? Can the Bundesbank be sure that the old relationship between money
and nominal output still holds in Germany, despite the shock of monetary
unification, when it does not in the US?
Eclectic fashion
Modern central bankers have never been more aware how damaging their errors
can be. But, having chosen or been forced to drop their monetary or exchange
rate targets, they appear to have little option except to use a range of
monetary indicators in eclectic fashion. Still, there are principles that
the three central bankers should bear in mind.
First, central banks, especially independent central banks, must explain
what they are doing and why. In this regard, Mr Greenspan has been a
relatively impressive Fed governor. Mr Mieno's approach has been rather more
oblique, while some recent indications by the Bundesbank of its policy
intentions have been confusing, at best.
Second, central banking is a forward-looking art. Long lead-times mean that
policy today must be appropriate for economic conditions in a year or more's
time. Mr Greenspan, mindful of parallels with the 1930s depression, was
right to cut US interest rates early and aggressively, but the test of his
dexterity will be whether he has the courage to raise rates again before
clear inflationary signs emerge. The Bank of Japan, stung by its failure to
prevent asset price inflation in the late 1980s, has eased policy too late
and too slowly. Precedent suggests it will raise them again too late.
As for the Bundesbank, still unhappy about the recent terms of monetary
unification and very aware of Germany's inflationary history, it must guard
against the temptation to fight yesterday's battles today. History can be a
useful supplement to current information. It can also be a debilitating
straitjacket.
