<TEXT>
Sir, The government is busily abolishing the minimum wage and you report
education secretary, John Patten, as rejecting the teachers' current pay
claim on the basis that 'students are queueing up to be teachers' ('9 per
cent choose teaching as their first choice of career', September 21). Is it
not time, therefore, to adopt a similar approach to MPs' (and ministers')
pay? There is, after all, no shortage of candidates for election to
Parliament or appointment to ministerial office.
Why should there be a statutory minimum wage for these posts, which also
carry regular increases? Candidates should be asked to state, before
election or appointment, what salary they require: electors, etc, would then
have the chance to consider cost as one among the factors influencing their
choice. Moreover, assessment of performance would be introduced to
Parliament: it is quite apparent that some MPs work harder than others.
Considerable savings might well result. Government might conceivably become
more efficient. Or is competitive tendering and performance-related pay only
for others?

<TEXT>
Sir, Bouquets to Mr Eddie George for telling the big four banks to support
small business more. Brickbats to Mr Kenneth Clarke for wasting the time of
his economic secretary, Mr Anthony Nelson, by telling him to explore the
relationship between finance and business ('Clarke pledges review of funding
for industry', September 10).
A committee set up by the then prime minister, James Callaghan, and chaired
by the then Sir Harold Wilson examined precisely this issue. Its 1979
report, The Financing of Small Firms, is available from HMSO and is still
relevant.
Although the recommendations led directly to some of the 'innovations' of
Mrs Thatcher's early time in office (notably the Loan Guarantee Scheme and
the Unlisted Securities Market), many of the same problems remain. Shortage
of low-level capital and the ease with which banks can pull the rug are
chief among them.
What we need now is action of the sort Mr George is taking, not another
inquiry.

<TEXT>
Sir, The governor of the Bank of England is right to be worried that the
economic upturn could be stifled ('Bank governor calls in clearers',
September 21). Our company's experience illustrates the problem well and
also points the way to one possible solution.
As a manufacturer with a high export ratio we were well looked after by our
bank for many years. Then, under increasing pressure from head office, our
local manager told us he was no longer allowed to include export debtors in
our total balance sheet for the purpose of calculating our lending facility.
He offered his bank's own Export Credit Guarantee Department scheme as an
alternative, but even he recoiled when he realised that this equated to an
interest charge of 24 per cent] In order to maintain our export momentum we
were forced to look for an alternative supplier of banking services with a
more enlightened attitude to exporters. We found this in Credit Lyonnais, a
leading French bank, which is progressively developing a branch network
throughout the UK. This bank makes no distinction between a debt in Hamburg
and a debt in Huddersfield.
It will be interesting to see whether the governor's initiative succeeds in
provoking a positive response from the UK clearers or whether the paralysis
which grips them has set in too deeply for that. If the latter is true,
other businessmen facing the same problem may like to know that they are
free to go beyond the UK for their banking just as for their car or their
refrigerator.

<TEXT>
WILSON, THE AUTHORISED LIFE
By Philip Ziegler Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 20, 593 pages
'Into the un-settled England of the 1820s the locomotive burst its way.' So
wrote the young Harold Wilson in the opening sentence of his prize-winning
Gladstone Memorial Essay on The State and the Railways in Great Britain
(1823-63) at Oxford University in the 1930s, though the rest of the essay,
we are told, was rather less high-powered.
It sounds remarkably like his subsequent career in politics.
Wilson was the most exciting leader of the opposition in postwar Britain. He
was not the most exciting prime minister. (That was Margaret Thatcher.)
After the initial bursts of steam, there were long cooling-off periods.
Yet Wilson still casts a spell over the British scene. There have been more
books about him, several of them written by himself, than any other British
prime minister since 1945, if you count Churchill as essentially a wartime
leader.
It is no disparagement of the earlier efforts to say that Philip Ziegler's
is the best so far. This is partly because Ziegler has had access to some
private papers previously unavailable, partly because he is an accomplished
and experienced biographer and partly because he has drawn, very sensibly
and with full acknowledgements, on the books that have gone before. The
sections on Wilson's early life in particular are fuller and more authentic
than in any earlier volume. Ziegler has also drawn intriguingly on
dispatches from the American Embassy in London, which has always kept a
close watch on British politics.
Do not, however, expect anything sensationally new. For Ziegler, like his
predecessors, has ducked the main question. That is how good, or how bad, a
prime minister Wilson was. Could anyone else have done better in the
circumstances of the time?
One can see why the question is constantly avoided. Wilson came in with such
high expectations in 1964 and went out with such a low reputation in 1976
that to upgrade him now would compel a big revaluation of his successors,
and of Edward Heath in between.
If someone were to argue now that Harold Wilson was the best British prime
minister in the past 30 years, it would make his successors look dire
indeed. Probably he wasn't. Yet if you look at the problems he had to face,
he wasn't all that bad, and if you look at the circumstances of Britain
today you may well conclude that not so much has changed.
Wilson had one problem peculiar to his time and not of his own making. That
was Vietnam. It was especially hard for the Labour party, some of which was
anti-American and anti-war of any kind. It coincided with, and to some
extent led to, a wave of student unrest which was not confined to Britain.
Those were not propitious times for a left-of-centre government, though one
wonders how a Tory administration would have responded to American requests
for military assistance.
Yet most of the problems of the Wilson era look depressingly familiar. The
prime minister's long fight to stave off devaluation in the mid-1960s is
remarkably similar to John Major's clinging to the exchange rate mechanism
last year. The Labour party quarrelled over Europe then just like the Tories
today. Even the calls for a referendum strike a chord. As for the challenges
to the leadership and the conspiratorial atmosphere, who is to say that the
Tories in the 1990s come out any better? Mrs Thatcher apart, Labour leaders
on the whole survive longer.
Even where Wilson failed, as in trade union reform, he set the way for
changes later. Heath failed on that score as well, but the very process of
trying made it easier for Mrs Thatcher. It was the same on Rhodesia which
inevitably took so much of Wilson's time and would equally have absorbed any
other British prime minister.
By concentrating on the biography of the man rather than the history of the
time, Ziegler tends to underestimate the difficulties that Wilson faced. As
in Ben Pimlott's even longer biography last year, there is no final judgment
of Wilson's place in British politics, and one suspects that the reason is
that no one is yet quite sure. It may depend on whether there is ever again
a Labour government.
Where Ziegler comes up trumps is on the personal side. Wilson may have had
his quirks and foibles, latterly even a mild paranoia, but he was
essentially a decent man, liked by most who worked with him. This is
Ziegler's main conclusion after four years of research: 'There were few
surprises . . . what did impress me far more than I expected was his
extraordinary niceness.'
It was said of him initially that he was an exceptionally boring man. A
politician needed to make the odd joke, so Wilson picked up a sense of
humour on the job. He did it very well. When he protested to the BBC that it
was keeping potential Labour voters at home by showing Steptoe and Son
during the last hour of polling in the 1964 election, the director-general
asked him what should be put in its place. 'Oedipus Rex,' he replied.
Steptoe was postponed.
Wilson was the only British prime minister this century apart from Stanley
Baldwin to resign voluntarily. Baldwin was 69 and very deaf. Wilson was
under 60 and relatively fit. He had acquired a reputation for deviousness
which is why even those who were told in advance did not believe that he
would really go. Yet anyone who presides over a political party as long as
Wilson must have a talent to finesse.
At the final cabinet meeting Tony Benn tried to take a photograph of the
outgoing leader, but was deterred. 'It was just a non-event,' Benn recorded,
'like a civil servant reaching the age of 60 and retiring.' He was probably
more right than he knew. There was a lot of the civil servant in Wilson,
and, on the politics, as Randolph Churchill wrote to Wilson in 1964: 'The
Leader's tie is palest pink, It's not as red as people think.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: The reality for miners represented by
unions in American pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE S SHIFLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Taylor's description of the US mining industry, Peabody's role
in it and the strike being waged by the United Mine Workers of America
('Hanson unions plan worldwide link-up', September 9) unfortunately creates
a picture at odds with the facts.
Rather than 'setting the pace for non-unionism' as Mr Taylor reports,
Peabody Coal Company and our affiliate, Eastern Associated Coal Corp, are
attempting to preserve our union-represented mines in the face of increasing
competition from non-union operations. All of the miners employed by the two
companies, it should be noted, are members of the United Mine Workers
(UMWA).
The reality facing union-represented miners in the US is clear and
straightforward: if mines employing UMWA members are going to continue to
exist, they must operate under a contract that enables them to be cost
competitive with non-union mines. That is precisely why the multi-employer
bargaining group of which Peabody Coal and Eastern Associated are members,
the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association (BCOA), has offered proposals to
the union that would increase competitiveness and, at the same time, expand
job opportunities for union-represented miners.
The need for competitiveness is readily apparent when you look at the US
coal industry's employment and production figures. Today, non-union
operators produce 70 per cent of the coal and employ 60 per cent of the
miners - quite the reverse of Mr Taylor's description of 'an industry where
two-thirds of the 100,000 miners are still organised'.
Finally, Mr Taylor's reference to Peabody as 'the leading negotiator for the
mine owners' does disservice to the BCOA. It is important to understand that
each member of the BCOA's four-person negotiating committee has an equal
vote; further, BCOA's lead negotiator is from another coal company - not
Peabody.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Half-baked pay policy returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to a UK Treasury wag, Kenneth Clarke told his top officials at an
early meeting that he had three priorities: first to be a member of the
cabinet, second to represent his Nottinghamshire constituency and, third, to
be chancellor.
These words are probably apocryphal, but indicative of the new spirit in the
department. What is not apocryphal is that Mr Clarke has declined to seek a
'pair' for divisions. (British MPs still employ an archaic method of voting
by tramping many times through division lobbies. Most ministers try to avoid
this by an accord with an opposition member who also agrees not to vote).
The chancellor's desire to escape from the Treasury is refreshing. But
spending a lot of time gossiping in the lobbies with MPs, some of them the
worse for wear after dinner, is an odd method of keeping in touch with the
mood of the country.
This approach might explain the resurrection of a discredited kind of public
sector pay policy. Under Labour, public sector pay was governed by a norm,
which was also meant to apply to the private sector. The Thatcher government
eventually abolished all pay norms. For a time it persisted with a cash
limit for public sector pay; but in the mid-1980s this gave way to overall
cash limits.
For the year to November 1993, Norman Lamont resurrected, as an exceptional
measure, a public pay settlement ceiling of 1 1/2 per cent, which has more
or less been observed. The correct justification was that it enabled the
public sector to discard fewer workers for any given cash limit; but the
Treasury saw it more as a way of getting a grip on public expenditure
itself.
The natural re-entry was to go back to general public sector cash limits.
Instead there is to be a freeze on pay budgets alone - which account for a
third of General Government Expenditure. Worse still, a ready-made cop-out
is provided for pay increases backed by improvements in what is variously
called 'productivity', 'efficiency' and 'performance'.
As a former chancellor, Nigel Lawson, has explained in The View from Number
Eleven, 'the pay-productivity exhortation is so familiar and uncontentious
that it is very difficult to do without it, especially at the dispatch box
at the House of Commons, where blunter, market-related arguments go down
extremely badly, even on the Conservative side'.
Nevertheless he considers it invalid for particular sectors, even though
broadly true for the economy as a whole. 'If wage increases were literally
related to increases in output per person then all sorts of bizarre
consequences would follow. Wages in high technology sectors would shoot
ahead and people like teachers and doctors, whose productivity is more
difficult to measure, would lag badly . . . Bus drivers, whose productivity
diminishes as a result of increasing congestion on the roads, would have
their pay cut . . . The true principle is the simpler, but less moralistic
one, that pay should be re-lated to the state of particular labour markets,'
ie, the re-cruitment and retention rates.
Private sector employers may talk the same nonsense about productivity. But
they know that in practice the benefits of rapidly improving technology must
be shared with the public in the form of price reductions - as in home
electronics - or their competitors will force these upon them. They also
know that if they allow the pay of workers with low measured productivity
increases to fall behind, they will find it hard to recruit.
The one certain consequence of the new public sector policy, if cash
ceilings are held, will be fewer jobs - whether for the same or for a worse
level of service. The government's task will be made more difficult because
it is not the paymaster in the greater part of the public sector. The
nationalised industries are a law unto themselves. Local authorities are
outside direct government control. Moreover, review bodies have
unfortunately been established to recommend pay for 1.4m staff, including
the armed forces, teachers, doctors and nurses. Review body awards have
almost always been above average. Even in the civil service, ministers'
hands are tied by a guarantee of partial private-sector comparability.
Although public and private sector pay diverge a lot from year to year, over
a slightly longer period they move in remarkable harmony - drawn together
not by bureaucratic procedures but by labour market forces.
The dangers of the new pay policy are: too many public sector job losses in
order to offset excessive pay settlements, general miseducation and perhaps
greater difficulty in keeping to the spending guidelines.
Yet, as Adam Smith once remarked, there is an awful lot of ruin in a nation.
For the moment, public sector backsliding is likely to be offset by the far
more important shift towards pay flexibility in the private sector, which
has been summarised in the September issue of Employment Gazette. First,
there has been a fall from two-thirds in 1984 to less than a half in the
proportion of employees whose pay is determined by collective bargaining.
Second, there has been a shift to more decentralised pay setting. Third is
an increase in what is unhappily named 'performance-related pay'.
In fact, traditional forms of rewarding effort, such as piece work, have
declined, but they have been more than offset by financial participation
such as employee shares or profit-related pay. So there is a modest but
growing element of pay which is linked to corporate profitability and which
represents the best hope for employment in the longer run, by inserting an
automatic element of flexibility into employment costs.
The extent of the collapse in wage inflation has still to be appreciated. It
was a frequent complaint in the 1980s that, in spite of high unemployment
and moderate inflation, annual earnings increases remained stuck at 7 1/2
per cent. Now they are down to 3 1/2 per cent. It is not surprising that pay
increases have failed to drop quite so far in manufacturing, as
international competitive pressures have been dampened in that sector by
devaluation. (Manufacturing pay increases were also above the whole economy
average when sterling was declining in the early and middle 1980s.)
Most remarkable of all has been the behaviour of unit labour costs. Thanks
to an unexpectedly vigorous rise in productivity, these have fallen by 1 per
cent over the whole economy, even when measured in national currencies.
Manufacturing costs have fallen even more, putting Britain in the low-cost
lead among the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries. The UK is in
a remarkably good competitive position; and so will be John Major if world
recovery occurs and he can hold on.
Of course the improvement reflects recession pressures. It also reflects the
benefits of two years inside the exchange rate mechanism. But it would
hardly have gone so far without the labour market shakeout of the 1980s, the
more competitive culture and the shift towards pay decentralisation.
Charts of national wages cannot, however, show the greater dispersion of pay
settlements in line with differing market pressures. This change will
ultimately price more people into work; it may already account for a jobs
trend that is not as bad as in many parts of the overregulated European
Community. The new policies have claimed victims among those at the adverse
end of market forces. But the victims will not be helped by stopping the
clock. Nor will anyone be helped by half-baked pay policies in the public
sector.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: End 'free' petrol perk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J M F PADOVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, During the current controversies regarding our crowded roads and
British Rail's revenues, any suggestion which could alleviate both
situations and which should suit transport and environment lobbies as well
as the Exchequer deserves to be looked at seriously.
Many businesses still provide unlimited free petrol for their employees.
Where this is done, a flat rate of tax benefit applies (just Pounds 300 a
year is payable on an average car, even assuming higher rate tax). Clearly,
an employee in this situation is encouraged to use his car excessively - for
leisure and to drive to and from work, thereby adding to road congestion
during the morning and evening rush hours. This mileage is in effect 'free',
whereas the same employee would have to pay out of his own pocket for a
season ticket if he chose to commute by rail or other public transport.
The alternative is very simple: an employee pays for all his fuel and merely
charges his employer (normally about 9p a mile) for genuine 'business'
miles. I believe the provision of 'free' petrol, particularly with the
current subsidy, should be made illegal in the autumn Budget.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Arts: 'Giovanni' and 'Tito' open Glyndebourne tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The performance began even before the conductor had lifted his baton; it was
a virtuoso exhibition of disciplined passion which only only someone really
short of money could achieve. Sarah Playfair, the Glyndbourne Touring
Opera's administrator stood before the footlights wringing the hearts of the
Sadlers Wells audience with lamentation for the loss of its grant.
The prospect of a sizeable Arts Council reduction in opera funding - to be
phased in gradually or, in the case of GTO, with brutal immediacy  - is now
looming menacingly large. In response, Miss Playfair gave us the first
sample of what may prove to be a new kind of performance in which her
audience-rousing rhetoric was in danger of overshadowing the evening's
account of La clemenza di Tito.
She needed to. In the summer, Glyndebourne received warning that the 1993
six-city, eight-week programme (September 16 - November 13) is the last for
which GTO can expect public funding. This threat is pointed at the head of
an artistic enterprise whose attention to its touring duties has obviously
met every possible Arts Council criterion and measurement of quality. It is
so patently unjust and lacking in logic that public outcry has already
started, and can only be expected to increase during the tour (it will if
Miss Playfair and her associates have anything to do with it).
But if GTO is to go under - a thought too horrible to contemplate for anyone
concerned with the health present and future of British opera - it will have
done so fighting, and with a 1993 schedule that shows exactly what the
company ideal is all about and why it is worth fighting for. Two Mozart
productions from the main festival lead the way - Don Giovanni in the famous
Peter Hall staging of 1977, Tito in the two-year-old one by Nicholas Hytner,
both cast with rising talents adding new lustre to the experience of each.
Still to come is the British premiere of an important opera, Cornet Rilke's
Song of Love and Death, by a significant (and in Britain largely unknown)
German composer, Siegfried Matthus.
In truth, neither of the Mozart performances - Thursday's Tito, Tuesday's
Giovanni - came fully into focus: in both cases the good things, of which
there were many, were compromised by flecks of ensemble imprecision, stage
untidiness which can be confidently expected to clear as the season gets
under way. (But the ill-considered surtitling of both operas is something
that needs urgent attention: the mirth aroused during Donna Anna's
narration, in defiance of its powerful delivery by Susan McCulloch, was
shaming.)
Hard-driven musical direction by both Ivor Bolton (Tito) and Louis Langree
(Giovanni) added to the feeling of unsettlement. Both these young
conductors, approaching their operas from the 'period' end of the Mozart
stylistic spectrum, concentrate on light orchestral sonorities, clean
rhythmic patterns and fast-moving dramatic paragraphs. In Mr Bolton's hands
the limpid Classicism of Tito is treated with a foursquare directness that
amounts to brusqueness; Mr Langree's Giovanni displays a rather more natural
sense of phrase-shape and part-balance, but only fitfully so. Relax, chaps]
The 1977 Giovanni production, seldom matched for its surface stillness and
dramatic mobilisation of fiery inner tensions, is here rather dimly
reproduced - David Massarella's is 'based on' Hall's, the giveaway phrase.
Too much clutter, too much cameo business: and where is the fiery cross that
marks Giovanni's passage to hell?
Still, the revival has several strong points in its favour, none stronger
than Simon Keenlyside's utterly compelling account of the title role.
Whether in the lizard slither of his limbs or the cold glitter and
unwavering gaze of his unsmiling eyes, the physical address of the role
betokens total absorption in its substance. The Italian words fall
exquisitely from his lips; except for a below-pitch serenade, the youthful
lyric baritone is in wonderful trim.
He forms a fine partnership with Steven Page's lean, Dickensian Leporello,
another lipsmackingly lively deliverer of words. Susan McCulloch's Anna (her
dramatic-soprano breadth of tone well employed), Susan Bickley's Elvira
(edgy but emotionally ripe) and Adrian Thompson's musically astute Ottavio
are all full of promise not wholly realised on opening night.
Hytner's Tito production - a typically tough, intelligent response to this
late, endlessly fascinating sample of Mozartian opera seria theatricality -
lacks its full festival stage apparatus but retains much of its original
cool thoughtfulness. The level of singing, a touch more 'local' than that
notched by the Giovanni cast, is never less than competent and, in the case
of Fiona Janes (a rich, dignified Sextus) and Anne Williams-King (an uneven
Vitellia with a splendidly fearless vocal approach), a good deal more.
Nigel Robson's Titus is subtle, deep, expertly negotiated. The Stephen
Oliver recitatives, written to replace those produced (in haste) by Sussmayr
for Mozart, are a worthwhile experiment that plainly failed. Back to
Sussmayr as soon as decently possible]

THE WEDDING BANQUET (15) Ang Lee
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE (PG) Nora Ephron
THE FUGITIVE (12) Andrew Davis
BOILING POINT (15) James B. Harris
IN THE SOUP (15) Alexandre Rockwell
By Nigel Andrews
Cinema's PR industry has its own form of shotgun wedding. When it likes the
sound of two words together, it forces them to unite for life. Thirty years
ago word-marriages like 'spinechilling,' 'bloodcurdling' and 'ribtickling'
were the stuff of promo language. Large with hyperbole, armed with the
warheads of exclamation marks, they hurtled out from the screen towards us
in movie trailers. Today's favourite compound, more suited to an age of
psychobabble and post-yuppyism, is 'feelgood.'
But what are feelgood movies? Short answer: The Wedding Banquet and
Sleepless In Seattle are. They present human problems and then they fix
them. They ask you to believe that people are fundamentally loving and warm.
They have happy endings. And they are the disposable-tissue industry's best
friend.
The worst feelgood movies can also make you feel cheated: your tears or
cheers wrung by a form of emotional arm-wrestling, using music, plot
contrivance, limpid-eyed stars and if possible a dog. But there are no dogs
in The Wedding Banquet and Sleepless In Seattle: two of the best romantic
comedies in recent memory. And there is enough sour wit and credible
cross-accident to make any last-reel handkerchief-reaching feel well earned.
The first movie won the Golden Bear at Berlin this year. The hero (Winston
Chao) is Taiwanese-American - just like the film - and lives prosperously in
New York. He devotes half his emotional energies to his native gay lover
(Mitchell Lichtenstein), the other half to parrying parental postcards from
Taipei urging marriage. When Pa and Ma turn up in person for a two-week
visit, the lovers stash away the gay calendars, masquerade as flat-sharers
and recruit a Taiwanese girl painter, who wants a 'green card' to stay in
America, for a let's-make-the-folks-happy wedding.
Writer-director Ang Lee scarcely sounds a false note. Things go right in the
story only after they have spent a proper amount of time going wrong. For
much of the movie, the hero's parent-deterring subterfuges backfire: as when
he fills in a computer marriage form they have sent and lists a
near-impossible blend of specifications in his bride - two doctorate
degrees, five languages, an opera singing career - only for a suitable
candidate to turn up on the next plane. She bursts into Madam Butterfly
right there at the East River cafe. Soon she has been put on the next plane
out.
Around the wedding itself, the comic set-pieces are scattered like confetti.
A registry ceremony with the foreign-born bride ever more bewildered in her
responses ('for better, for richer', 'till sickness and death . . .'); a gay
best man (Lichtenstein) making sure his friend's lips are wiped after each
kiss; and games of musical woks back home in the kitchen. Here the gay
lover, conscious of appearances, leaps away from the stove whenever the
parents pass through, pushing artist-bride plus wooden spoon into the steam.
The film's final accelerando of disaster - including pregnancy and parental
truth-learning - keeps the story piquant and perilous even as the (almost)
happy ending looms.
Sleepless In Seattle also spends furlongs of footage working to deserve its
feelgood factor. Here is a romance between a boy and girl who never meet.
Well, they might meet in the final minutes, but why should I spoil your fun
by specifying whether they do; whether Seattle widower Tom Hanks and
Baltimore pen-friend Meg Ryan actually fulfil their mooted Valentine's Day
tryst atop the Empire State Building? Only Hanks's small son (Ross Malinger)
has really tried to make it work. He first set the two hearts fluttering by
pushing lonely Dad into a radio agony phone-in where he bared his soul to a
listening world including, 3000 miles away in a car, the captivated Ryan.
Director and co-writer Nora Ephron manhandles David Twohy's original story
into a semblance of her own sweet-and-sour romance When Harry Met Sally.
This is more 'When Sam Did His Damnedest Not To Meet Annie.' Sundered by a
continent, each spends the film dithering with his or her respective dates
or mates: Hanks with a hyena-laughed former flame he has re-ignited, Ryan
with her stuffy fiance Walter (Bill Pullman). 'Walter: it's quite a formal
name, isn't it?' says her mother, planting the early anti-Walter time-bomb.
And yes, soon Ryan is hankering after Hanks: a fact we recognise from her
constant re-viewings of An Affair To Remember on TV, used by Ephron as a
flag-of-distress romantic leitmotif, and from her sobbings over Cary Grant
and Deborah Kerr as they stumble star-crossed towards the world's tallest
building.
Of course the Empire State is no longer the world's tallest building. But
who wants a romantic tryst atop the World Trade Centre? Besides, Sleepless
In Seattle is all about the absurdity of romantic destiny as a concept.
'What we think is fate,' someone cracks, 'is just two neuroses knowing
they're a perfect match.' This film would be sentimental if it were not
funny at sentimentality's expense. Witness the scene where a girl sobbingly
relates the climax to a favourite weepie to two men friends, who then parody
her with a sobbing account of the climax to The Dirty Dozen.
It ends, of course, with stars and sighs and 'destiny' fulfilled. But this,
like The Wedding Banquet, is a feelgood film that puts in enough early work
in the reality department to earn its right to feel good and to make us do
so.
The Fugitive has been a monster hit in America. There any film with Harrison
Ford jumping from crashed prison vans, sidestepping oncoming express trains,
leaping from the tops of dams and exposing corruption in high places carries
the label 'Critic-proof'. Actually, American critics lauded the film, which
shows that even an intelligent person can end up soft in the brain if hit
over the head often enough.
Dr Richard Kimble (Ford) is accused of having killed his wife. He is packed
off to Death Row but escapes from his prison escort. Then he doubles back to
Chicago in disguise to start proving his innocence. Then - oh but you have
all seen The Fugitive series on TV and if you have not you may get some
fresh enjoyment out of this high-octane twaddle.
Speaking personally, I felt that the engine kept missing. Too many
coincidences. Too many 'Oh there he is]' sightings in hospital corridors,
which fail unaccountably to end in capture. Nor was I happy with the idea of
a one-handed hit man, the real killer played by ghoulish Andreas Katsulas.
Surely murdering a doctor's fully conscious, struggling wife is difficult
enough with two hands? And then there is the danger - realised here - that
the framed doctor will know how to look up the said uni-limb in the medical
records.
Never mind. Insanity has its own momentum, Hollywood its own
ignore-the-rules driving licence. Andrew (Under Siege) Davis directs at 90
mph, as if trying to reach journey's end without a single comfort stop; and
Tommy Lee Jones, in swashbuckling form as the pursuing US Marshal, screeches
round even more corners on two wheels than Mr Ford.
Boiling Point and In The Soup have nought in common but their quasi-culinary
titles and their links with the Mafia. The first is a thriller that scarcely
reaches feeding-bottle temperature. Mafia-embroiled crook Dennis Hopper,
wearing glowing orange hair, is pursued through the night by black detective
Wesley Snipes, failing to glow at all either histrionically or optically.
Lesson for the week: putting a black actor in a film noir is as problematic
as putting a white actor in a snow movie. You had better make sure your
lighting cameraman knows his business.
In The Soup we have reviewed before, when it opened to three men and a dog
at the National Film Theatre. Now this funny film about film-making is in
the West End - with its mishap-prone hero (Steve Buscemi) finding that the
shortest route to movie finance is through an even more mishap-prone Mafia
boss (Seymour Cassel) - and you may all, if you please, attend.

This year's Booker Prize Short List has a truly international flavour. From
Ireland there is Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (Secker &amp; Warburg), by
a young novelist who is a master of comic dialogue. From Canada comes
late-show presenter Michael Ignatieff's Scar Tissue (Chatto &amp; Windus) and
also Carole Shields The Stone Diaries (Fourth Estate). Then the Australian
David Malouf's many-layered Remembering Babylon (Chatto) while from the West
Indies via Bradford and Oxford is the writer Caryl Phillips's Crossing The
River (Bloomsbury), and finally Tibor Fischer's Under the Frog (Polygon and
Penguin), a British novelist born to Hungarian parents. Vikram Seth's Indian
blockbuster A Suitable Boy is conspicuous by its absence.
The judges, chaired by Lord Gowrie, are Gillian Beer, Anne Chisholm,
Nicholas Clee and Olivier Todd. The Prize, now in its 25th year, (Pounds
20,000 to the winner) will be awarded at the Guildhall on October 26,
televised on BBC-2's Late Show.

A new series of Critical Eye on Channel 4 begins by asking whether the
Polish people are better off living under a market economy rather than the
command economy of the communist era. Made by the leftwing Tattooist group,
the programme looks at Brazil - a country with a capitalist economy which
has failed to reach the standard of living achieved by Poland in its 40
years of socialism (9.00).
It seems surprising that television makes so few programmes about dogs,
given the widespread enthusiasm for them. There is, of course, 'One Man And
His Dog', and there was once upon a time Barbara Woodhouse. So the start of
The Dog's Tale on BBC2 is something of an occasion. The seven-part series
roams the world to tell the story of man's best friend ..and slave, and
sometimes dinner (9.30).
Small Objects Of Desire, is a series in which the subject matter is at times
obscured by the programme-making techniques. Today's object, the sandwich,
must have been with us since the invention of the loaf, even if the Earl of
Sandwich did do his famous three-layer trick in 1762 (10.10 BBC2).

FT  23 SEP 93 / Arts: Perverse 'Therese Raquin' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A green gloomy glass bowl shimmers through the dark, suggesting an empty
cell. Two figures dressed like pest controllers in black PVC intone the
sombre opening words of Therese Raquin. The cast stagger on stage, cackling,
lumbered with their props of table and chairs. A lone young woman, like a
figure from a Munch painting, stands disconsolately apart. We are firmly in
the grip of director's theatre.
Julia Bardsley, the young (31) new joint director (with Tim Supple) of the
Young Vic, begins her reign with the production of Zola's novel of lust,
murder and retribution which made her reputation at the Leicester Haymarket.
It is stridently in the popular vein of physical theatre, the staff of life
for troupes like Theatre de Complicite, theatre that forces the audience to
spend most of its time watching actors perform tricks of free expression and
bodily improvisation, dormant since drama school, rather than lose itself in
the action.
It may well let fresh air into old classics but it can also encourage stale
longueurs. It is particularly perverse to adopt the approach to Zola's
masterpiece of realism, in which he poured his genius into depicting the
life of the petty bourgeoisie in minute detail.
The intensity of the relationship between Therese (Anastasia Hille) and
Laurent (Rory Edwards), the lover who awakens her sexuality, is dissipated
by distracting directorial inventiveness. For their first love making the
actors flutter white sheets to suggest orgasm. In their final despair they
throw themselves about the stage like two-years-olds in a tantrum. It little
helps that Hille is a graduate of the Vanessa Redgrave School of the demotic
dirge, and Edwards is stronger at brooding menace than passion.
The real problem comes with the other actors. Apart from Madame Raquin,
Bardsley has given them Mickey Mouse voices: the doomed husband Camille
(Gordon Milne) shows his feeble mindedness by talking like John Major. There
are absolutely no laughs in Therese Raquin and populating the stage with
goons is yet another distraction.
Happily Bardsley has her inspirations. The fish bowl set is correctly
claustrophobic; the drowning of Camille in the River Seine is cleverly and
damply transposed to a bath on stage; his haunting ghost is suitably creepy;
and the scene in which Laurent visits the morgue to discover Camille's body
is the best possible justification for expressionistic theatre.
At the end Therese and Camille are locked in a deathly embrace, and you
suddenly get involved with their tragedy. For almost three hours the two
actors have been allowed to go their separate ways, dipping deep into their
individual boxes of actorly tricks. Their final lapse into Zola's naturalism
comes too late.
Still at least Bardsley has the guts to have a point of view and the
refurbished Young Vic is as comfortable as it is welcoming.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Technology: Rigid standards lead to the top - David Waller
on how German software company SAP has prospered on a vision five men shared
21 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-one years ago, five software engineers left the German arm of IBM to
set up their own company. Their aim was to develop 'standard' software
powerful enough to handle all companies' data management needs in areas as
diverse as production, sales and distribution and accounting, and flexible
enough to adapt to the individual requirements of companies in widely
different industrial sectors. It would be an alternative to costly
tailor-made software packages.
The dream turned into a reality and SAP, the company which they founded, is
today one of the world's top dozen software companies and European market
leader in integrated business software. Its main competitor in this segment
of the market is Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software (DBS), a subsidiary of the US
business information group.
For more than a decade, the mainstay of SAP's business has been a product
called R/2, a software system designed for use on large companies' mainframe
computers. Customers include more than 1,400 of Germany's largest companies
 -but also 75 US corporations, including nine of the top 10 Fortune 500
companies.
The system typically handles tasks involving the input of thousands of
individual items of data - for example, an airline's ticket-issuing system
or cheque clearing for a large bank.
It is designed on a modular basis, so that the customer can extend the use
of the system to cover different applications at will. At the core of the
system is what SAP calls the Basis System which provides limited data
storage and word-processing facilities. On to this the customer can bolt
modules which cover functions such as materials management, quality
assurance, plant maintenance, financial accounting or cost accounting
projects.
While R/2 accounted for more than half SAP's group sales of DM831m (Pounds
332m) last year, the thrust of the business is set to change fundamentally
with the recent introduction of R/3 - a new generation of software which is
designed to appeal to small and medium-sized companies.
According to Dietmar Hopp, SAP's chief executive and one of the four
founders who own 80 per cent of the company's shares, the move to a new
product mirrors fundamental changes in the computer technology market.
As computers become cheaper and smaller while retaining the power of larger
machines, companies are shifting away from expensive mainframe computers to
client-server systems, which form networks of personal computers and
workstations to process the company's data. Coupled with this is the move to
open systems, where hardware and software are built to common standards
which enable them to be interconnected with an ease unknown in the past.
Hopp says the new product, which SAP began marketing last year, is designed
to follow the market trend away from mainframe computers - and to open up a
vast customer base of medium-sized companies for whom R/2 was inappropriate
and too expensive. While R/2 costs anywhere between DM400,000 and DM2.5m to
install, R/3 sells at a minimum of DM100,000.
As yet, SAP is the only company in the world to offer this kind of
fully-integrated modular software for mid-range computers, although DBS is
expected to launch a rival product this year. Other companies tend to
specialise in one functional area (for example, providing accounting or
human resources software) but R/3 links the financial, personnel and
manufacturing functions together.
The new product achieved sales of DM37m last year. This year, Hopp predicts,
SAP will have sold 1,000 R/3 systems - 10 times as many in 1992 when the
system was sold only in Germany - generating sales of DM200m. As the
marketing push continues in the US and Europe, analysts are hopeful that
sales will climb to DM350m in 1994.
This is likely to compensate for the slow decline in revenue from R/2, which
is likely to lose ground as more companies move away from mainframes. R/3
can also be used to upgrade existing R/2 systems.
Having tackled the 'midi-market' with R/3, the next step is to develop
integrated standard software for the PC market. To this end, SAP is in talks
with Microsoft, the US software group. SAP hopes that this will lead to the
development of a package which the US group could incorporate into its
Windows-based systems.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Technology: Novell plan falls at final hurdle - Geof
Wheelwright and Alan Cane report on a stalled Unix deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last-minute objections from leading computer suppliers have delayed, for the
time being, a move which would have redrawn the battle lines in the
so-called operating systems wars.
Novell, the US-based market leader in PC networking, which earlier this year
completed a Dollars 320m (Pounds 208m) acquisition of Unix Systems
Laboratories from AT&amp;T, had planned to 'give away' the rights to the Unix
operating system to X/Open, a computer industry consortium including IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. X/Open is concerned to set standards
which ensure that versions of Unix from different manufacturers are
compatible and allow applications software to be moved freely between
machines.
Now objections by a number of the companies which would have been affected
by the deal have stalled Novell's plan to relinquish the rights to Unix. The
idea had been that passing control of Unix to an industry consortium would
silence critics who argue that control of such an important piece of
software should not rest with any one company.
It is understood the objections turn around disagreements over who will fund
further Unix developments and questions about the future of networking
software independently developed by companies in the X/Open consortium.
Intense lobbying means that it is likely the plan will eventually go ahead,
but in the interim Novell has announced a plan to: 'Bring PC market
economics to the Unix marketplace.'
Unix is one of a number of competing operating systems which are being
promoted as the key to 'client-server' computing, networks of personal
computers and servers which are expected to take over from mainframe
computers for many corporate applications. Unix allows many users to work on
the same computer system and individual users to work on several programs
simultaneously. Designed originally for mid-range computers, it is effective
on today's very powerful reduced instruction set computing (Risc)
processors.
Its principal rival as industry standard operating software is Windows NT,
released a few weeks ago by Microsoft, the US software house which dominates
personal computer software.
Novell said earlier this week that in order to increase the appeal of Unix
to the personal computer sector it would speed up the integration between
Unix and Novell's own 'NetWare' network operating system.
In practical terms this means that Novell's own version of Unix, UnixWare,
will be incorporated into the Unix source code written for Intel
microprocessors. Intel chips power some 80 per cent of today's personal
computers.
By 1994, according to Novell, it will be able to provide common network
management, system directories and other features which will allow NetWare
and Unix to be tightly integrated. This means that computer companies
building systems around Unix will not have to worry about designing new
network software connections; that will be handled by the Unix/NetWare
specification.
In other words, it should be easier to build enterprise-wide information
management systems - existing local area networks running on NetWare can be
more simply integrated with Unix software at the heart of the system.
The new software will be submitted to X/Open for its approval. Novell hopes
to gain in market share and market unity what it will lose in development
autonomy. Ray Noorda, Novell chief executive, said: 'Novell bought the Unix
system to lead the industry in unifying it, while increasing its openness
and strengthening its value to customers through volume distribution. Our
business is to extend the value of the Unix system to the tens of millions
of industry-standard computers shipped with Intel processors.'
This week ICL, the UK-based manufacturer owned by Fujitsu of Japan and a big
supporter of X/Open, said it supported the Novell UnixWare strategy and
welcomed its decision to offer to move control of Unix to the consortium.
Peter Stuart, business strategy manager for ICL's client-server systems
division, said it would result in a significant reduction of confusion in
the market.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Technology: SAP learns to adapt to the world of
client-server computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Of the handful of European software houses which have achieved success in
international markets, two are German, SAP and Software AG. Both came to
prominence in the 1980s. Both are also going through considerable cultural
and technological changes as they adjust to new technologies and to ways of
processing data prevalent in the 1990s.
SAP's international success is based on its understanding that companies
derive most value from integrated business software which obeys common
standards throughout the organisation, where the definitions used by the
back office in accounting are the same as the front office uses in selling.
Its R/2 product for IBM mainframes proved especially popular with
multinational corporations, who were able to instal the same system in each
location, benefiting from consistent information descriptions, one-time data
input and real-time working. Among SAP's customers are ICI, Esso, Mobil Oil
and British Rail. Of the top 10 US corporations, eight use SAP software.
Germany remains the company's main market, with 80 of the top 100 largest
industrial companies as customers. If the company has a fault, it is a
certain rigidity of approach, something it shares with Software AG. One
analyst says: 'It is a very engineering-oriented company'.
The change to client-server, open system designs, will not prove easy. R/3
was at first intended to replace R/2, but now both will be offered in
parallel for the foreseeable future. According to the consultancy Ovum: 'At
issue is the extent to which R/3 systems are capable of achieving the high
volume performance of their ancestor R/2.'
The US remains a critical market for SAP and it has doubled its staff there
in the past 15 months to counter an earlier lack of marketing aggression.
It has formed a number of alliances to help its cultural shift. Siemens
Nixdorf is a reseller of SAP software and consultancy partners include
Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Schitag Ernst &amp; Young. Last year, it
announced a technological and marketing agreement with Software AG.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Time to sing a new
song - The new head of English National Opera tells Lucy Kellaway of his
plans to boost attendance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the shop next door to the London Coliseum, T-shirts bearing the slogan
Everyone Needs Opera have been reduced to Pounds 7.99. Posters advertising
last season's more obscure operas have been slashed to 50p.
The giddy days are over when clever branding brought the world and its wife
to see far-out productions at the English National Opera. The market has
changed, the management has changed and the strategy has changed.
Dennis Marks, ENO's new general director, sits in his poky office under the
roof of London's second opera house humming one of the arias in La Boheme
under his breath. That opera, which opened last week, is the most popular
ever written. And with it, ENO is trying to re-establish itself as Britain's
most popular opera company.
'Accessibility,' Marks says emphatically. 'That one word is at the centre of
everything we are trying to do. We are trying to take musical theatre to the
widest number of people regardless of their capacity to pay.'
In marketing terms, it is a tall order. Getting people to go to the opera
when they are fighting to pay the mortgage is not easy. ENO has been
successful in branding itself in the 1980s; the challenge for the 1990s is
to capitalise on the brand name with more direct ways of getting bottoms on
seats.
The racy advertisements featuring bare-chested stage hands and sopranos in
negligees have won awards and done their job, says Marks, while the ENO
corporate logo is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Less successful
has been the recent Everyone Needs Opera slogan, which Marks has decided to
withdraw.
'One day I walked out of Leicester Square tube and saw someone in a sleeping
bag under one of the Everybody Needs Opera posters. It exposed the company
as being underaware of what was going on around it.'
Marks has no plans for finding a replacement for the unhappy slogan, arguing
that people know that ENO exists. To remind them again would be a waste of
money. 'What we must do is to cross the gap between perception and getting
people in.'
Like most other theatres, ENO's subscriptions have fallen in the recession,
as have advance bookings. Instead, people buy tickets on the day - or don't,
depending on how rich they feel. This has had a serious effect on the
company's profits - each annual percentage point fall from the capacity
audience cuts profits by Pounds 100,000 a year.
Falling audiences have led to a deficit of more than Pounds 2m. Unless the
tide is turned, ENO will have no chance of meeting this year's budget.
To fight back, the company has just installed a state-of-the-art
computerised ticket system which allows it to keep tabs on everyone who has
ever been to the Coliseum. 'We know what sort of buyer you are, what you
have been to see,' says Marks. The aim is for the right kind of publicity to
reach the right kind of customer.
ENO has rolled its public relations, development and press departments into
a single unit, which is devising tactics for talking to the audience more
directly. It has relaunched its subscription scheme and is trying to lure
the audience back to booking in advance. It has tried to find out why its
numbers have fallen, and is targeting sectors of the possible audience -
such as people living outside London - that have been staying at home in
droves.
The company is also trying to market itself better to sponsors - which are
being expected to make up the shortfall left by the dwindling grant from the
Arts Council. ENO recognises that it will never get much of the corporate
entertainment market with its tatty opera house. Instead, it is
concentrating efforts on companies in complementary lines of business.
'The kind of work ENO does is something that is attractive to companies that
are interested in development,' says Marks. ENO was recently given money by
management consultancy KPMG as part of its 'future positive' campaign.
But whether the new team can bring it off depends on the operas themselves.
'We have to be like the car in the Volkswagen advertisement  - we have to be
the brilliant fast one, but also the reliable one. What we are is a company
people can go to as they go to a cinema.'
Depending on which metaphor you prefer, La Boheme is either the opera
equivalent of the reliable car or of Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, the
critics verdict so far is that the gear changes were too obvious and the
special effects wanting.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): More than just small
beer - Microbreweries have transformed US bars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Connoisseurs of beer say that 10 years ago a visit to an American bar was a
dull experience. The choice was limited and beers were almost
indistinguishable in taste from each other.
However, the past decade has seen a revolution in American beer-drinking
habits. These days, bars and supermarkets are often stocked with dozens of
US brands, many put out by small, local breweries which aim to create
uniquely flavoured products. Choice has widened substantially. Once, US
brewers produced almost nothing but lager. Today, small producers have
loaded shelves with dark beers, ales and such esoteric tipples as 'raspberry
wheat beer'. Microbreweries, as these small, beer makers are called, have
attracted a loyal following on the west coast and in the north-east of the
US and the trend is starting to gain momentum in other regions.
Small brewers were almost non-existent in the early 1980s. Today, there are
almost 400 scattered throughout the country. The marketing strategy of the
big US brewers has traditionally been to offer a good-quality beer with as
wide a taste-appeal as possible.
But critics claim this strategy has produced bland-tasting brews. 'The
microbrewers have done well because they found a market niche the large
brewers had ignored for a long time - Americans who enjoy a
distinctive-tasting beer,' says Irene Firmat, general manager of the Full
Sail Brewery in Oregon.
Microbreweries in the US still account for a tiny portion of total market
share - slightly more than 1 per cent, according to William Owens, publisher
of Beer, The Magazine. Still, their rising success, which has occurred in
the absence of any mass-marketing campaign, has been impressive enough to
make even the large breweries sit up and take notice.
To fight back, many larger brewers have now started to produce their own
distinctive-tasting brands. 'The specialty beer market is growing by leaps
and bounds,' says Ruben Valdillez of Coors Brewing Company, a leading US
beer maker which now counts its strong-flavoured Killion's Irish Red among
its most successful brands. 'I think the microbreweries have a lot to do
with that. They have helped educate the American palate.'
Taste is just part of the equation, though. Even the biggest fans admit that
microbreweries do not always produce the perfect brew. Small brewers appeal
to consumers for other reasons as well. 'There is a certain amount of local
pride behind interest in the microbreweries,' says Nicholas Godfrey,
marketing director of the Mass Bay Brewing Company in Boston. 'People like
to drink a beer that they know was made around the corner.'
To capitalise on local loyalties, many microbrewers also run bars, dubbed
'brew-pubs', where customers can drink a product made on the premises. In
Boston, the John Harvard Brew House and the Commonwealth Brewing company
have both been attracting constant flows of beer drinkers since they opened
a year ago.
Microbrewers can add humour to the market - for instance, the 'Alimony'
brand, advertised as the 'bitterest beer in the world'. They also offer
variety. Lind Brewery of San Francisco markets a wheat beer in the summer,
switches to an 'Oktoberfest' brand for the autumn and then starts churning
out a Christmas Ale for the holiday season.
This type of marketing technique is starting to influence the large brewers,
which say they are planning seasonal launches.
Another trend boosting the microbrewing industry is the growing number of
specialty beer magazines on the market. 'Magazines have been part of the
exposure,' said Roger Lind, president of Lind Brewery. 'They stimulate
interest by running taste constests, explaining the history of beer-making,
and keeping track of what is new on the market.'
While they may still be a small force in the overall market, microbreweries
are making their influence felt. American beer connoisseurs say they are
grateful. 'This is the way it should be,' said Alan Eames, a beer
'anthropologist' based in Boston. 'A trip to the local bar is no longer a
boring experience.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Who reads what and
why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an FT reader, you are likely to be an Adrian Amex, Gordon Golfer or
possibly a Terence or Tara Tennis. What you are least likely to be is a
Cheryl Clubber or a Basil or Betty British.
The characters are the creation of CIA, the independent advertising media
buyer, drawn from information that 25,000 UK adults supplied about
themselves. The technique used - known in market survey jargon as
'psychographic mapping' - is the latest attempt to build on the old A-E
socio-economic classifications.
Ian Rogers, CIA UK managing director, says the exercise has revealed that
surprisingly diverse kinds of readers buy the same daily newspapers for
different reasons. Further exploration of the characters should enable them
to target their clients' advertising money more effectively.
Here is CIA's full cast list.
Terry Torremolinos, 6.6 per cent of the population, C2D, single, under 35
and an early school-leaver. Terry enjoys a night at the pub, hates
gardening, plays football and rarely sits down to a meal. He reads The Daily
Record, Daily Star, Sun or Today.
Cheryl Clubber, 7.7 per cent of the population, C2D, 15-24, still studying
if single but likely to finish education at 16; if married, likely to have
children under four.
On holiday, she likes to eat, drink and lie in the sun. She enters
competitions on packets and in magazines and buys new brands to see what
they are like. She reads the Daily Star, Sun, Daily Mirror.
Carol Kitchen, 7.8 per cent of the population, DE, 35-54, finished education
at 15. Carol is married with children aged five-15 and either does not go
out to work, or works part time. She prefers holidays in Britain and reads
papers for entertainment, not news. She reads the Daily Record, Daily
Mirror.
Basil and Betty British, 16.3 per cent of population, 55-plus, C2D. Left
school 14-15, not working. Basil and Betty think there is too much concern
about the environment. They read the Daily Mirror, Daily Star.
Adrian Amex, 9.2 per cent of the population, 35-54, AB. He is married, works
full-time and is educated beyond the age of 19. Adrian reads the financial
pages, enjoys entertaining people at home, owns stocks and shares, and made
more than five business flights in the past year. He reads the FT,
Independent, Times, Daily Telegraph, Guardian, or Daily Mail.
Gordon Golfer, 8.2 per cent of the population, 45-plus, AB. He is married,
is working full-time or has recently retired and left education at 17-18.
Gordon enjoys his garden, relies on newspapers to keep himself informed, and
has a personal equity plan. He reads the FT, Times, Daily Telegraph, Daily
Mail, Daily Express or Today.
Terence and Tara Tennis, 13 per cent of the population, aged 15-34, ABC1,
they are single, still studying or working full-time. They like to stand out
in a crowd, enjoy foreign food, windsurfing/climbing/skiing/tennis, treat
themselves to things they do not need, and have seen a pop/rock/jazz concert
in the past six months. They read the Guardian, Independent, Times, FT, or
Today.

FT  23 SEP 93 / People: SERC chief to head Glaxo's research
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, the world's biggest spender of pharmaceuticals research and
development, is reorganising its R&amp;D.
The company, which spent Pounds 739 on R&amp;D last financial year and intends
to spend Pounds 850m this year, has split the position of R&amp;D director.
Sir Mark Richmond, 62, chairman of the UK's Science and Engineering Research
Council, is to become director of the research division for a period of two
years. The SERC is the largest of Britain's government-funded research
councils; it distributes more than Pounds 500m a year in grants to
university scientists and engineers.
Goran Ando, currently research and development director, becomes director of
group development and product strategy. Both Ando and Sir Mark will report
to Richard Sykes, chief executive, and board director responsible for R&amp;D.
Sykes says the rapidly expanding knowledge base, especially in the
understanding of the genetic basis of disease and the microbiology of cells,
means that pharmaceutical companies would increasingly have to have access
to information from both universities and biotechnology groups.
'To be successful you have to harness these new technologies. Having access
research is really critical to the future of the company and you need very
good people to do it.
'Sir Mark has exceptional scientific skills from his experience of molecular
genetics at Edinburgh University and microbial biology at Bristol
University. He also has organisational skills from running the SERC and
being vice-chancellor of Manchester University, the largest outside London.'
Sir Mark will be responsible for research as Glaxo's research organisation
moves into its new headquarters in Stevenage.
Sykes says Ando's position was also highly critical. He would be responsible
for developing safe, effective medicines that represented significant
advances in therapy. For products to be successful, they had to offer value.
As head of product strategy, he would ensure that the important links
between product development and marketing were tightened.

LIBERAL Democrats backed a call by Sir David Steel, the party's foreign
affairs spokesman, for a shake-up in the structure of the United Nations.
Delegates agreed there should be reform of the permanent membership of the
UN security council, but rejected a proposal requiring automatic seats for
the European Community and Japan.
A motion calling for the UN to develop peacemaking as well as peacekeeping
machinery was endorsed as was the establishment of an international criminal
court with a human rights commissioner within the UN.
Sir David said: 'We must ensure that the UN itself is fully accountable for
its actions or inactions.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Pension split could mar
Ashdown address
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN will today seek to sum up his party's conference in a
speech warning representatives that too much is riding on the Liberal
Democrats for them to throw away their present opportunities by acting
irresponsibly.
'The message will be that we have won people's hope, now we must win their
trust, their confidence,' one party strategist said yesterday. 'It's about
turning potential into reality.'
Just before Mr Ashdown speaks the conference will have faced what the
leadership sees as the most serious test this week of its political
maturity, when it considers a paper which would cut back its commitment to
spending on pensioners.
A split is inevitable, with an amendment to the paper Retirement with
Dignity being put forward by Mr Archy Kirkwood, the party's social security
spokesman.
At the general election the party promised to uprate pensions in line with
earnings, but the new policy paper proposes instead uprating the basic
pension in line with prices, and targeting extra help at those most in need.
Mr Kirkwood's proposal would restore the commitment to the earnings link.
The leadership is said to regard this vote as critical, as a continuing
pledge to link pensions with earnings could turn out to be unrealistic
unless the party commits itself to higher taxes.
Party officials say that the decision today will also affect the way in
which policy on benefits more generally is developed.
In particular, a vote against the targeted approach on pensions will limit
the policymakers' freedom of manoeuvre in proposing targeted rather than
universal benefits in other areas such as child support.
Mr Ashdown's speech will underline to representatives that to make the most
of their recent successes and be taken seriously, the party must face up to
some difficult choices in the spending commitments it takes on.
He will also use his speech to put forward new ideas about international
peacekeeping and peace-making, and is expected to deal extensively with what
is happening in Bosnia.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Party upbeat on prospects for
Euro-seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES TO the constit-uency boundaries for next June's European elections
have increased the Liberal Democrats' chances of capitalising on their
successes in south-west England, party strategists said yesterday.
But the party appears divided about what approach to adopt in the campaign.
In spite of the insistence this week that the Liberal Democrats' task is to
turn the protest vote it attracts into positive support, campaign planners
said the party would be inviting voters to deliver a verdict on the
government's performance since the general election.
The Conservatives fear the Liberal Democrats could seize a quarter of the 32
Euro-constituencies the Tories won in 1989, if the most recent local
election results are replicated next summer.
Seeking to temper over-optimism about their prospects, however, the Liberal
Democrats point out that they have tended to do worse in Euro-elections than
in local elections. In 1989, they were still reeling after the collapse of
the Alliance and won only 6.5 per cent of the vote, while the Greens won 15
per cent.
In an effort to maximise support and limit the damage caused to its chances
by its pro-European stance, the party's manifesto will not deal exclusively
with European policy but seek to show how the UK taking a lead in Europe
would help on issues such as jobs and law and order. It would also stress
environmental policies.
As the government this morning published details of the plans for allocating
the five extra European Parliament seats in England, Mr Chris Rennard, the
Liberal Democrats' campaigns director, said that the new boundaries improved
his party's prospects in Cornwall, West Plymouth and Somerset.
On the basis of the party's share of the vote in last year's general
election, it could take both Euro-constituencies with swings of less than
3.5 per cent - far below the spectacular increases in support it has
achieved in recent parliamentary by-elections.
Mr Tim Clement-Jones, the director of the European election campaign, said
that the party would not be able to avoid using the word 'federalism',
though the image of a Brussels superstate many people associated with it was
not Liberal Democrat policy.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Racism row continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DELEGATES approved an emergency motion calling on all local parties to
campaign against racists and urged Liberal Democrat councillors to seek the
eviction of proven racists from council housing and their dismissal from
council employment.
Mr Akbar Ali, from the Mossley Hill local party in Liverpool, said
accusations of racism against Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets had been
'conveniently forgotten' in the past.
He said the issue had been 'simmering' for seven years and in spite of a
promised investigation by Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, no
action had been taken. 'This time we won't allow this matter to be brushed
under the carpet,' he said.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Court levy plan aims to boost
crime fund
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFERENCE called for a levy on court fines to raise money for crime
prevention schemes.
Delegates backed a move to require local councils to set up crime and safety
task forces, charged with developing crime reduction programmes in
partnership with community organisations.
Crime Concern Campaign chairman Mr Tim Clement-Jones, from Streatham, south
London, said a 5 per cent levy on fines for criminal offences, including
motoring offences, would double the Pounds 7.5m currently spent on crime
prevention. A 10 per cent levy would triple that amount.
But there was concern that the levy would lead to higher fines, hitting the
less well off who were sometimes taken to court for minor offences.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Beith warns 'panic cuts'
threaten recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, warned yesterday that
economic recovery could be endangered by 'panic cuts' to reduce the Pounds
50bn public sector borrowing requirement.
He said there was a strong case for 'limited and targeted additional
borrowing' to boost capital investment.
Delegates overwhelmingly approved a motion calling for the abandonment of
the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel. The motion also called
for a Budget in which any tax increases were 'fair and progressive'.
Like Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Beith argued that judgment on the
necessity of tax rises should be left until nearer the November Budget.
He suggested that spending should be increased on construction, housing,
public transport and the promotion of energy efficiency. The first signs of
recovery could be 'snuffed out' if the government mishandled the massive
debt problem it had created, he added. Economic recovery - the only means of
getting the deficit down to manageable proportions - would be threatened by
cuts in capital spending and family incomes.
The warm applause Mr Beith received from some delegates reflected their
annoyance at reports that Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, was under
pressure to allocate the role of Treasury spokesman to a more glamorous
figure.
Mr Beith indicated his acceptance of the new emphasis on the need for
policies to secure a return to full employment by agreeing to accept an
amendment on the role of a central bank. This stipulated that its autonomy
in the use of monetary policy to fight inflation must be consistent with a
'wider, democratically set strategy for sustainable growth and economic
justice'.
The party's commitment to a single European currency - reaffirmed by Mr
Beith - was challenged by rank-and-file speakers. Mr Hilary Whittaker from
Beckenham, south east London, said it would be premature to establish a
timetable for a single currency. Mr Beith acknowledged the difficulties
following the disruption of the European exchange rate mechanism, but argued
that it would offer the opportunity for low interest rates and more
investment and jobs.
The route to a single currency envisaged when the Maastricht treaty was
negotiated could no longer be seen as the only way forward.
Mr Beith said people had to be convinced of the positive merits of a single
currency. Monetary union would work in the long run only if people saw it as
beneficial. He envisaged the eventual return of sterling to the ERM and
urged that when it did so there should be 'a quite short transition period'
to a single currency.
Mr Beith said 'recent events have made the ERM a very draughty waiting room
in which it might not be wise to spend too long once the greater security of
a well-insulated single currency is available'.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Hopes of housing upturn boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES FOR an upturn in the housing market this autumn were boosted yesterday
when the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported stronger than
normal market activity in August, a traditionally quiet month.
Its survey of members in England and Wales for the three months to the end
of August found that chartered surveyor estate agents were confident that
autumn sales would be encouraging.
However, Mr Peter Miller, the institution's housing spokesman, said the
enthusiasm was 'tempered by false dawns in the past'.
Mr Miller added: 'As buyer confidence returns, activity ebbs and flows but
the tide continues to rise.'
The institution's survey - based on reports from across England and Wales -
found variations in the state of the market in different part of the
country. In northern England sales and viewings increased in many areas, but
with few signs of price rises. Local factors were behind price increases.
The institution said that in Middlesbrough, demand was highest at the bottom
of the housing ladder as buyers found they could afford repossessed and
vacant properties.
Surveyors in south-east England reported an improvement in sales and
confidence. An exception was Epsom, Surrey, where August was said to be the
quietest for several years.
One estate agent said the month in Epsom ended with a few new instructions
and many more valuations, but added: 'The market still very much needs a
boost really to waken it - perhaps the promised interest rate drop will
actually happen and help.'
The picture in East Anglia was mixed. London was busy in August, with a lack
of new properties coming on the market. Vendors held back in the expectation
that prices would rise.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Patten may back fees from students
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday gave the strongest signal yet
that the government is seriously considering raising extra funds from
students for universities.
Mr Patten, who was addressing the Committee of Vice-chancellors and
Principals at Leicester University, said that no options were ruled out. He
added that the taxpayer benefited from higher education in a less direct way
than graduates. However, he suggested that different universities should not
be allowed to charge different levels of fees.
The committee last month commissioned a report by consultants London
Economics on four methods of extra funding from students, and today will
announce which is favoured.
The options include: increased income tax for graduates; loans to pay for
flat-rate tuition; loans for living costs; and loans for additional 'top-up
fees' that may be charged by universities.
Under the last option, universities could charge differential fees to
students, without subsidy from the government. This option was attacked on
Tuesday by Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary.
Mr Patten has also signalled reservations. In a series of questions for the
vice-chancellors, he asked: 'Should selection for entry to higher education
continue, as far as possible, to be made on educational grounds with no
student excluded because of the need to contribute financially? As you know,
the government has been concerned in the past on this point in connection
with the possible introduction of top-up fees by individual universities.'
He also asked the vice-chancellors if they wanted to continue expanding
higher education, and whether there was any evidence that students who
contributed towards their tuition were more motivated.
Mr Patten defended quality checks in university departments by higher
education funding councils. He also backed the higher education charter,
launched earlier this week and attacked by vice-chancellors as an
'opportunity missed', and as a 'sham' by the Association of University
Teachers.
Middlesex University has become the first British college to set up a
recruiting office in Malaysia. The move follows intensive efforts by the
government to attract more students from the Far East.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Commercial sector helps raise building orders 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PATCHINESS of the upturn in the construction industry was highlighted
yesterday.
Official figures made it clear that total orders were rising, but showed big
differences in the performance of different sectors.
According to provisional figures from the Department of the Environment,
total orders rose 9 per cent to nearly Pounds 4bn in the three months from
May to July, compared with the same period last year.
But orders were still 5 per cent lower than for the previous three months of
this year. The statistics are based on constant 1985 prices, seasonally
adjusted.
The best-performing sector in the latest three months was private commercial
building. Orders in the sector were 27 per cent higher than in the previous
three months and were 20 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a
year ago.
The private industrial sector remains depressed, with orders down 18 per
cent on the previous three months and 1 per cent lower than in the same
period last year.
In housing, new orders in the private sector fell 10 per cent compared with
the previous three months of this year - but were 3 per cent higher than in
the same period last year.
This confirms reports from housebuilders of a lull in activity in early
summer.
Public housing and housing association orders in the latest three months
were 3 per cent lower than in February-to-April, but 65 per cent higher than
the same period of last year.
The worst-performing sector was in infrastructure, where orders were 28 per
cent lower than in February-to-April and 13 per cent lower than in
May-to-July last year.
Mr Christopher Vickers, construction spokesman for the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors, said declines in new orders in the private industrial
and infrastructure sectors were 'extremely worrying'.
Investment in both sectors was 'the essential ingredient for a sustained
recovery', he said.
'We would expect to see signs of an upturn as the economy picks up and
confidence returns to business and industry,' he added.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Ferry operator in link with Belgium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE latest move by the Channel tunnel's rivals in the run-up to its
opening, Sally Line, the UK's third largest cross-channel ferry operator,
yesterday announced a partnership with Regie voor Maritiem Transport, the
Belgian ferry operator.
The partnership with RMT, formed in preparation for the tunnel's scheduled
opening in spring next year, will run ferry crossings to Ostend in Belgium
from the port of Ramsgate.
Sailings between Dover and Ostend, which have been operated for the last
seven years by a partnership between RMT and P&amp;O Ferries, will end.
P&amp;O Ferries and Stena Sealink, the two largest operators, have concentrated
on establishing shuttle services between Dover and Calais, the shortest
channel crossing. Both plan to offer 25 sailings a day in each direction, to
compete with trains running through the tunnel.
The Scandinavian-owned Sally Line operates two passenger ferries and one
freight ferry between Ramsgate and Dunkirk in northern France. The company
also operates a freight-only service between Ramsgate and Ostend with two
ships.
RMT currently operates three ferries and two jetfoils between Ostend and
Dover. Under a five-year agreement to run from January 1 next year, the RMT
service will be merged with the two Sally Line freight ferries to offer up
to 10 freight crossings a day on the route.
The new partnership predicts a combined share of the cross-channel passenger
market of 20 per cent. This would be double Sally Line's current share of 10
per cent. For the freight market it sees a combined market of 23 per cent,
compared with Sally Line's 17 per cent.
Sally Holdings UK, the parent company, also owns the port of Ramsgate, and
will be investing Pounds 6m in increasing its capacity. The company expects
to add 50 jobs to the 800-strong port workforce.
Mr Michael Kingshott, chairman of Sally UK Holdings, said that the move
would secure the future of the ferry operation after the opening of the
Channel tunnel.
'We expect to enter the next century as a major ferry operator on the short
sea routes, increasing our market share for both passenger and freight
operations,' he said.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Fall in pound eases non-EC trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED competitiveness linked to sterling's devaluation pushed the UK's
trade deficit with countries outside the European Community to its lowest
level for nearly three years, government figures showed yesterday.
The value in non-EC exports last month rose to a record high, while the
value of imports was the lowest since January.
The figures strengthen the probability that the trade deficit with the whole
world for 1993 will be substantially lower than the Pounds 21bn estimated by
the Treasury in March. Last year the whole-world trade deficit was Pounds
13.4bn.
Monthly trade figures for the EC will not be available until later this year
because of the introduction of a new statistical system. Non-EC trade
accounts for about 40 per cent of all UK exports and imports.
The excess of UK imports over exports in August for non-EC nations came to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 570m, after Pounds 698m in July. The value of
exports last month was Pounds 4.87bn, 1.5 per cent up on July, while imports
fell 1 per cent on the month to Pounds 5.44bn.
In underlying volume terms, exports in the three months to the end of August
rose 4 per cent on the previous three months. Over the same period,
underlying import volumes were flat. These underlying measures strip out
price movements and also exclude trade in oil and erratic items such as
ships, aircraft and gems.
The figures suggest that the pound's downward movement since Britain left
the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago has aided exporters. It
appears imports have been kept down by a combination of weak domestic demand
and increased consumption of UK-made goods.
Yesterday's Central Statistical Office data follow an improved trend for the
trade deficit since the end of last year. The difference between non-EC
import and export values, excluding oil and erratics, has come down to
Pounds 1.74bn in the three months to August from Pounds 2.54bn in the final
quarter of last year and Pounds 2.31bn in the first quarter of 1993.
In the latest three month period, unit values for non-EC exports rose 11 per
cent on the corresponding time last year, reflecting the ability of UK
companies to push through price increases even in the face of relatively
weak world demand. Import values rose somewhat faster, by 14 per cent over
the comparable period, mainly because of the 11 per cent depreciation in
sterling since it left the ERM.
However the effect of increased import prices in widening the trade deficit
appears to have been more than offset by expanded export volumes resulting
from UK goods being competitively priced against comparable products.
The UK continued to run a trade surplus with the US and Canada in August, as
it has done every month since March. The Pounds 212m surplus for trade with
this part of the world in the three months to Au-gust was the highest
three-monthly figure since early 1989.
Recent trade trends have particularly benefited manufactured goods, for
which the August trade deficit of Pounds 123m was the lowest monthly figure
since July 1991. Between June and August, the trade deficit for manufactured
goods was Pounds 594m, roughly half the Pounds 1.19bn recorded in the
previous three months.
The trade deficit for food, drink and tobacco was Pounds 205m in the latest
three months, compared with Pounds 243m in the March-to-May period.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Higher gilts investment hailed as recovery signal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET INVESTMENT by institutions in UK gilts jumped sharply to Pounds 5.6bn in
the second quarter of this year from Pounds 3.3bn in the first quarter, the
Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
Investment in overseas company securities dropped to below Pounds 2bn during
the period compared with Pounds 3.6bn in the first quarter, further
reflecting a shift to investment in the UK. Net investment in UK company
securities rose to Pounds 6.1bn from Pounds 5.6bn.
Mr Paul Walton, an analyst with James Capel, welcomed the figures as a
long-term indication of recovery. He said there was plenty of money to fund
gilts and rights issues in the UK. 'Liquidity is not an issue,' he said.
Total net investment by institutions fell slightly to Pounds 11.8bn from the
record Pounds 12.5bn in the first quarter. Net investment by long-term
insurance funds fell by Pounds 300m between the first and second quarters,
while unit trust investment declined by Pounds 300m.
This was partly offset by a rise of Pounds 700m in net investment in
insurance funds classified 'other than long term'.
Total net investment in pension funds was Pounds 2.1bn in the second quarter
of the year, almost unchanged on the first quarter. Investment trust
companies' total net investment was Pounds 544m in the period, financed by
net capital issues of Pounds 300m and an increase in bank borrowing of
Pounds 278m.
Net sales of unit trusts reached Pounds 2.3bn against Pounds 1.6bn in the
first quarter.
Mr Walton also said the shift into equities and bonds and away from the
housing market was attractive because it showed the money was being used
more productively.
He stressed that the figures were significant because for the first time
institutions were obliged to supply data, and they were also externally
audited. 'In the past they were seen as a bit of a joke,' he said.
But Mr Angus McIntosh, head of research at Richard Ellis, chartered
surveyors, argued that the figures could not be relied on to produce an
accurate picture of the commercial property market.
He said the figures were 'suspect' because the 1991 and 1992 statistics on
new investment by institutions had been revised upwards; the figures took no
account of investment from overseas or owner-occupier purchasers; and the
trend shown of net disinvestment in UK property in the second quarter by
insurance companies contradicted other evidence.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Major to decide on ITV takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIVIDED ministerial opinion means Mr John Major will have to decide whether
ITV ownership should be changed to allow the nine largest companies to take
each other over.
A meeting, to be chaired by the prime minister, will be convened later this
autumn to reach a decision. Both Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, and Mr
John Redwood, Welsh secretary, have written to Mr Peter Brooke, national
heritage secretary, opposing relaxing the rules because of the threat to
regional programmes.
Relaxation of the rules has been argued vigorously by the largest ITV
companies such as Carlton and Granada, but opposed by companies such as
Meridian, Anglia and HTV.
The nine largest ITV companies are banned under the 1990 Broadcasting Act
from taking each other over. A change could have a dramatic effect on the
share price of a number of ITV companies that could become bid targets -
such as London Weekend Television, Anglia and Central.
Mr Major will also have to decide whether to extend the moratorium on other
takeovers of ITV companies which runs out on January 1. These are possible
at the moment, but the Independent Television Commission's considerable
discretion will be much reduced from next year.
A moratorium, supporters say, would give more time for thought on complex
matters such as digital technology and the potential for a large increase in
the number of channels available. An extension would need legislation.
A number of large ITV companies plan to ask the government to bring forward
the date when the bids for their franchises can be reviewed. The 10-year
licences, issued at the beginning of this year, can be reviewed and extended
after six years.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, which bid a total of Pounds 53.3m for the
now merged Yorkshire and Tyne Tees franchises, will tell the Commons
national heritage committee next month that a review should take place in
1996.
Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian, the south of England ITV company which
bid Pounds 36.52m, also wants to see a review after four years rather than
piecemeal changes.
The National Heritage Department has given no indication that it is willing
to look again at the ITV system and Mr Brooke has made it clear that he
wants to draw a line under the 1990 Broadcasting Act and concentrate on a
review of the BBC.
Staff at Independent Television News were warned in a letter from management
yesterday to expect more job cuts in a review of working practices and
staffing.
Working practice changes set out in the letter include journalists making
increasing use of cameras and learning basic tape-editing skills.
In the past few years there have been several hundred redundancies at ITN in
a bid to cut costs.

The ABC figures for The Sun, another News International paper, indicated

FT  23 SEP 93 / Ex-Swans workers win Pounds 1.5m payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS representing more than 700 workers made redundant at Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder, since it went into receivership in May have won
compensation for their members totalling about Pounds 1.5m, Chris Tighe
writes.
An industrial tribunal judgment, announced yesterday, ruled that Price
Waterhouse, the receivers, breached section 188 of the 1992 Trades Union
Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act by failing to consult on the
redundancies.
The six shipyard unions involved said the ruling established the principle
that workers' rights could not be waived in receivership.
The payments will be up to a maximum of about Pounds 2,600 per person. The
unions will now seek another 90-day protected period for the 80 Swans
workers who are to be made redundant next week.
Price Waterhouse said last night that criticisms made in the judgment failed
to appreciate the commercial realities of the situation.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Union leaders pull back in public pay fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION leaders representing 5.5m public-sector workers drew back yesterday
from any immediate conflict over the government's tight public-sector pay
policy.
Instead, after a two-hour meeting at the Trades Union Congress, they agreed
to launch a campaign against the policy. The campaign will involve a rally
early next year, lobbying of Conservative MPs in marginal constituencies and
efforts to persuade the public of the justice of their claim.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the 45 public sector unions had
lit a 'slow burning fuse'. Industrial disruption could not be ruled out next
spring and early next summer when the main public-sector pay deals are
normally negotiated.
Union leaders were keen yesterday to play down suggestions of conflict. They
said they did not intend to fall into a 'trap' set by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, by calling for disruption that would antagonise the public and
unite next month's Conservative party conference.
The TUC is to encourage public-sector unions to co-ordinate their pay
claims.
Mr Monks said: 'We are starting what will be a long campaign that could
leave the government badly bruised at the end of it.'
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public services union,
said four Civil Service unions would take strike action on November 5 in
protest at market testing in the Civil Service. On November 20, he added, a
demonstration was planned in defence of the National Health Service.
Yesterday's meeting brought none of the calls for action and predictions of
chaos in the public sector heard at the Trades Union Congress a fortnight
ago.

FT  23 SEP 93 / CBI urges help for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT initiatives to help small businesses raise the finance they need
to expand should be introduced, the Confederation of British Industry's east
midlands regional council said yesterday.
Welcoming moves by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, to
raise employers' concerns over the lending policies of leading banks, the
council said a change was needed in banking practices to help companies
exploit the signs of recovery.
Mr Geoff Nicholls, chairman of the regional council, said: 'A significant
number of our members are saying past banking policies, particularly the
reliance on security-based lending, penalised expansion.'
Initiatives were needed such as establishing a network that could put small
and medium-sized companies in touch with potential investors.
Among the concerns raised by CBI members were the high cost of debt finance
and the preference by banks to link the amount companies could borrow to the
value of their equity rather than their ability to use operating profits to
repay loans.
Mr Nicholls said: 'There's widespread satisfaction that the government and
the Bank are now taking this matter up.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / Change to wills after divorce urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Commission, the government's law reform advisory body, called
yesterday for a change in the law governing the effect of divorce on wills.
When a couple marries, any previous will made by either of them is
automatically revoked. If they get divorced, however, this does not happen.
The law tries to cut former spouses out of wills by providing that any gift
to them should 'lapse'.
The commission says that if testators die without altering their wills or do
not re-marry, problems can arise which defeat the testator's intentions.
If the husband's intention was for a gift to go to his former wife, or their
children if she died before him, divorce would deprive the children of that
gift.
A number of respondents to a consultation paper told the commission that the
time had come to change the law so that a will was automat-ically revoked on
divorce.
But the commission believes the problem can be solved by changing the law so
that the will would take effect as if the former spouse died on the date of
the divorce.

A BID to transfer the Pounds 1.7bn annual Youth Training budget to the
Department for Education is being fought by the Department of Employment.
The employment department is lobbying the Treasury to keep control of YT -
which is administered by the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils -
after receiving strong representations from employers and their
representative bodies.
The education department wants to divert the bulk of the YT budget to help
fund its plans to expand college-based training. A move to college-based YT
would mean that the scheme was no longer rooted in the workplace.
About 300,000 young people a year are on the current YT scheme.
Mr Christopher Stewart - Smith, president of the Association of British
Chambers of Commerce, said in a letter to Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary: 'A switch to colleges would not be helpful for those considerable
numbers of young people for whom a basic competence and work-based
qualification is the key to worthwhile employment.'
He said that locating YT in colleges would make it driven by supply rather
than demand and cause it to lose contact with the employers expected to
provide work placements and jobs.

THE TIMES is continuing to hold on to a circulation increase of more than 30
per cent nearly three weeks after the newspaper cut its weekday cover price
by 15p to 30p.
The official ABC sales figure for the first week of the price reduction
shows an average sale of 461,000. The average figure for August was 354,280.
Sales in the second week are expected to be about 468,000.
Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, which is owned by Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News International media group, said yesterday: 'It's a success.
People agree that price is a factor, including university lecturers and
civil servants - our core readership.'
Wholesalers say that the main loser has been The Daily Telegraph, which has
a cover price of 48p. According to some it has lost as much as 4 per cent.
Other papers have not been seriously affected. Sales of The Independent,
which costs 45p, were less than 1 per cent lower, although at this time of
the year sales ought to be rising.
The broadsheet market as a whole is estimated to have risen by just over 1
per cent.
Mr Stothard said yesterday that he was receiving as many as 40 letters a day
on the price cut, most of them from former readers of The Daily Telegraph
and those who used to buy The Times two or three times a week and now take
it more regularly.
The ABC figures for The Sun, another News International paper, indicated
that its 5p price reduction to 20p increased the sales of the popular
tabloid by 234,341 to 3.832m in August, an increase of nearly 7 per cent.

<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the leading cellular mobile telephone operator, yesterday
announced a 50 per cent cut in peak-time rates for its new MetroDigital
service as the price war in the industry intensified, Paul Taylor writes.
It also unveiled an interest-free loan scheme which will enable customers to
spread the Pounds 240 cost of MetroDigital phones over two years.
The moves signal Vodafone's determination to compete head-to-head with
Mercury's new One-2-One digital service which is initially limited to within
the M25 area.
MetroDigital will initially be available in 168 cities and towns.
Subscribers will be able to nominate the location of their 'home cell' with
peak-time local calls costing 10p a minute and nationwide calls at 12.5p -
half existing tariffs. All off-peak calls will cost 5p a minute from the
home cell.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Sally Line agrees Belgian link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE latest move by the Channel tunnel's rivals in the run-up to its
opening, Sally Line, the UK's third largest cross-channel ferry operator,
yesterday announced a partnership with Regie voor Maritiem Transport, the
Belgian ferry operator.
The partnership with RMT, formed in preparation for the tunnel's scheduled
opening in spring next year, will run ferry crossings to Ostend in Belgium
from the port of Ramsgate.
Sailings between Dover and Ostend, which have been operated for the last
seven years by a partnership between RMT and P&amp;O Ferries, will end.
P&amp;O Ferries and Stena Sealink, the two largest operators, have concentrated
on establishing shuttle services between Dover and Calais, the shortest
channel crossing. Both plan to offer 25 sailings a day in each direction, to
compete with the tunnel.
The Scandinavian-owned Sally Line operates two passenger ferries and one
freight ferry between Ramsgate and Dunkirk in northern France. The company
also operates a freight-only service between Ramsgate and Ostend.
RMT currently operates three ferries and two jetfoils between Ostend and
Dover. Under a five-year agreement to run from January 1 next year, the RMT
service will be merged with the two Sally Line freight ferries to offer up
to 10 freight crossings a day on the route.
The new partnership predicts a combined share of the cross-channel passenger
market of 20 per cent. This would be double Sally Line's current share of 10
per cent. For the freight market it sees a combined market of 23 per cent,
compared with Sally Line's 17 per cent.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Ford and Vauxhall to cut output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD and Vauxhall are to cut production sharply at their Halewood and Luton
car plants next month because of the impact of the continuing steep decline
in sales of new cars in continental Europe.
The further reductions follow the announcements earlier this week that
Nissan is being forced to halve production at its Sunderland plant during
November and December, and that Vauxhall is cutting output at its Luton
plant this month.
Ford is to eliminate 18 shifts at its plant at Halewood, Merseyside, during
October, the equivalent of stopping production for two weeks.
The short-time working at Halewood, which produces the Ford Escort, will
cause the loss of about 7,000 cars - more than a third of the plant's
planned output. By the end of October Ford will have cut 42 shifts at
Halewood this year.
About 16 per cent of Halewood's production of cars and vans was exported
last year, but Ford yesterday said that in the face of the big fall in
demand in continental European markets it had been forced to stop car
exports from the plant.
Ford will cut one shift during October at its plant in Dagenham, Essex,
which produces the Fiesta small car, while the Transit van plant at
Southampton will work a four-day week.
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, yesterday said that
it would be forced to stop production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra
for at least two weeks at its plant at Luton, Bedfordshire, during October
with the loss of around 8,000 cars.
The Luton plant has been one of those hit hardest by short-time working
since the beginning of the year, and by the end of October it will already
have lost the equivalent of 10 weeks of production. The plant will produce
no cars in the first and fourth weeks of October.
The Luton plant has been badly affected during September with the loss of 14
shifts, including a complete halt in production this week.
Vauxhall said that it expected its plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, which
produces the Astra, to work normally during October after losing 11 shifts
during September.
Both Ford and Vauxhall said yesterday that there would be no lay-offs at the
Halewood and Luton plants, and that workers would be brought in for
additional training programmes.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Milk prices will be set by auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW DARE, chief executive of Milk Marque, yesterday said that an
annual auction of milk supplies will be used to set prices when the Pounds
3.3bn market is liberalised next April. The first auction will take place
next month.
Mr Dare's proposals for a 'rolling' auction are the first indication of how
dairy pricing will work in the free market.
He has been widely criticised in the dairy industry for promising higher
prices to farmers following the abolition of the Milk Marketing Board, the
government's compulsory purchasing scheme.
Milk Marque, a voluntary co-operative and the board's successor, says
auctions will allow the free market to determine prices. But because the UK
produces only 85 per cent of its needs, pressure on supplies is likely to
push up prices.
Mr Dare estimates that consumers could pay up to 8 per cent more if dairy
companies pass these price rises on.
Milk prices are currently set by a committee of board and dairy industry
representatives.
Mr Dare said the auction was 'an open and fair system and yet one in which
customers have to compete with each other for the milk supplies they want,
thereby helping farmers to receive full market value'.
Dairy companies wanting to buy supplies from Milk Marque will be asked to
indicate quantities wanted and prices offered. Once the bids are received, a
market price will be allocated.
Prices may be squeezed upwards if there is strong demand, or customers may
scale back demand. Milk left over from the allocations will be sold at lower
prices or on the spot market.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Waldegrave denies arms deception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM Waldegrave, Foreign Office minister between July 1988 and
November 1990, yesterday denied that the government had deceived parliament
about its policy on arms sales to Iraq.
However his insistence, at the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, that government
guidelines restricting defence exports remained substantially unchanged
throughout his period in office was challenged by Lord Justice Scott and
Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, the inquiry's counsel.
Mr Waldegrave, who is now the public services minister, told the inquiry: 'I
don't remember thinking for a moment we had a frightfully secretive policy
of changing the guidelines. It would have been (politically) suicidal if we
had.'
In earlier evidence to the inquiry, Mr Mark Higson, a former Foreign Office
official who served under Mr Waldegrave, said the minister was among those
who had misled parliament by not announcing publicly a relaxation of the
strict export guidelines to Iraq.
Mr Waldegrave yesterday confirmed that after the ceasefire in the Iraq-Iran
war he had agreed to a change of wording in the original guidelines which
allowed certain defence exports to go through the licensing system. He said
this was only a marginal change.
But he was challenged with references to documents which appeared to
contradict him, including one Whitehall briefing note in December 1988 that
stated the guidelines had been modified quite substantially.
Mr Waldegrave defended his decision not to inform Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
then prime minister, of the change to the guidelines because the issue was
not of sufficient importance, and because she had her mind on other foreign
policy issues.
In a note sent at the end of 1988 Mrs Thatcher asked to be told of any
significant changes in policy governing defence exports to Iran and Iraq.
The minister told the inquiry that he could imagine what she would have said
if he had told her about the revised guidelines: 'Yes, William, why are you
taking up my time?'
Mr Waldegrave is to give further evidence today. He is expected to be
questioned over his statement that 'no dual-use exports were allowed if it
was believed they were to be used to produce weapons'.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Howard unveils tough changes to police discipline system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, yesterday braved a hostile audience
of police superintendents to unveil tough changes to the disciplinary
system.
In his speech to the Police Superintendents' Association, Mr Howard made no
concessions on proposed sweeping reforms to the criminal justice system
contained in the Sheehy report, the Runciman Royal Commission and a
government white paper.
On Tuesday, 200 delegates, representing 2,400 superintendents in England and
Wales, passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in the criminal justice
system. But Mr Howard refused - against the conference's hopes - to rule out
any of the proposals in the Sheehy report, and emphasised his determination
to make the most of the opportunity to improve the criminal justice system.
His speech followed a critical address by Chief Supt David Golding, the
PSA's president, who described the Sheehy report as a 'sloppy document' that
heralded a downmarket service. Nor would the unprecedented range of reforms
improve the system.
He said: 'The rush to change police structures and practice is not
justified, and does nothing to prevent one crime or gain a single
conviction.' The government was targeting the police and not the overall
system.
The home secretary's reforms of disciplinary procedures, which were not
greeted warmly, include:
A procedure for immediate dismissal for flagrant misconduct.
Police officers required to resign or be dismissed for a pattern of
unsatisfactory behaviour.
Removal of the right to legal representation for officers facing
disciplinary hearings.
Supt Brian Butcher, for the PSA national executive, said the conference had
been disappointed by both yesterday's changes and Mr Howard's apparent
failure to listen to concerns during the consultation period to the Sheehy
report, which extends to the end of the month.
He said: 'The changes to the disciplinary system will remove some of the
safeguards that currently exist and the rights, like that of silence, that
officers enjoy.' The Police Federation, representing policemen up to the
rank of chief inspector, is to take legal advice about the new guidelines.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the reforms would make for 'a
more centralised, more bureaucratic and less effective police service'.
Mr Howard said he hoped to make an announcement on the Sheehy report late
next month.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Porsche importer in S Korean talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORSCHE'S wholly owned UK importer hopes by the end of the year to conclude
a deal to import and distribute South Korean-built Daewoo cars.
Daewoo, Korea's third-largest carmaker after Hyundai and Kia, wants to
establish a UK market presence by 1995.
It has been negotiating for several months with Porsche Cars Great Britain.
The latter is being encouraged by its Stuttgart parent company to broaden
its business base following the considerable shrinkage of the luxury sports
car business that has taken place since the boom years of the late 1980s.
The Reading-based company is also signing import agreements with a number of
continental-based Porsche accessory manufacturers.
In sharp contrast to Porsche, Daewoo is a producer of family and smaller
cars.
Until recently Daewoo relied heavily on producing cars for sale in North
America. These were based on the Opel Kadett and bore the General Motors'
Pontiac LeMans badge. However, it ended this joint venture last year in
order to make and sell its own cars globally.
It currently makes around 750,000 vehicles a year, but plans to invest
Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.27bn) to triple output to 2.2m a year by the end of
the decade - 1m a year outside Korea.
Marketing restrictions agreed with GM expire next year, after which Daewoo
is free to implement plans to expand into the US and Europe.
Mr Kevin Gaskell, Porsche Cars' managing director, said the Porsche and
Daewoo businesses would be run separately. Import and distribution would be
carried out at separate centres and there would be no provision for Porsche
dealers to sell Daewoos.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Ex-Swan Hunter staff win Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS representing more than 700 workers made redundant at Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder, since it went into receivership in May have won
compensation for their members totalling around Pounds 1.5m.
An industrial tribunal judgment, announced yesterday, ruled that Price
Waterhouse, the receivers, breached section 188 of the 1992 Trades Union
Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act by not holding consultation on the
redundancies.
The tribunal said the 90 days from May 28, when the first 420 redundancies
took effect, was a protected period. Those who lost their jobs from that
date were entitled to compensation of up to 90 days' pay.
The six shipyard unions involved said the ruling established the principle
that workers' rights could not be waived in receivership.
The payments, which will come from the state redundancy fund because the
company is in receivership, will be up to a maximum of about Pounds 2,600 a
head because the ceiling is pegged at Pounds 205 per week.
Many payments will be far less because any money received in lieu of notice
or earned during the 90-day protected period is deducted from the payment.
This law is due to change in November.
Mr Tommy Brennan, the Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, said it was an important decision. For many of Swans'
ex-workers, Pounds 2,000 was 'one heck of a lot of money'. He added: 'This
will also highlight the way receivers can escape any financial backlash.'
The unions will now seek another 90-day protected period for the 80 Swans
workers who are to be made redundant next week.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Buy-out proposed for DTI agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has announced a review of the operation
of its Accounts Services Agency in a move which could pave the way for the
first management buy-out of a central government unit.
Mr Timothy Eggar, a DTI minister, yesterday said that he had decided to
commission a survey from consultants to assess the commercial position of
the agency and alternative forms of ownership and management.
The Accounts Services Agency carries out financial and management accounting
services. It became an executive agency under the government's Next Steps
initiative in October 1991, and was formerly the DTI's accounts branch.
Mr Eggar's action follows proposals for a buy-out submitted to him at the
start of this month by the management of the agency, backed by Capita Group,
the consultants providing services to the public sector.
He said he welcomed the proposal and commissioned the review in light of the
'very good progress' the agency had made in developing a commercial
approach.
The agency has already won the contracts for accounts work at the Department
of National Heritage, the Historic Royal Palaces Agency, the Royal Parks
Agency, the Central Statistical Office and the government regulators for
electricity, gas and telecoms.
Mr Michael Hoddinott, the chief executive of the agency, said that the
buy-out would allow greater autonomy in determining staff wages and
incentives and was more likely to allow it to win contracts from market
testing in other government departments.
He said he would encourage staff to take out shares in the company, and that
while details of the buy-out were being finalised, management and staff
would have considerable control and would not be dominated by Capita,
adviser on the proposal document.
Companies House is currently undergoing a review by external consultants
into possible options, including privatisation. But the Accounts Agency is
the first to have forced a review by proposing a buy-out.
Proposals have been invited from consultants, and one is expected to be
selected within the next few weeks.
The agency has about 90 staff and is based in Newport, Gwent. Its own
accounts to March 31 this year show net assets of Pounds 142m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US semiconductor industry and trade officials yesterday expressed dismay at
a fall in the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market below the 20 per
cent annual target level which Washington has laid so much store by.
'We are extremely concerned about this negative trend in the market share,'
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said.
His remarks came after the two governments released the foreign share of
Japan's semiconductor market in the second quarter of this year. The US
calculations showed a fall to 19.2 per cent.
The second-quarter figure represents a decline of 1 percentage point from
the 20.2 per cent market share taken by US and other foreign companies in
the fourth quarter of 1993 and follows a decline to 19.6 per cent in the
first quarter of this year.
Japanese officials, however, use a different calculating method which showed
the foreign share to be at 21.6 per cent.
Mr Andrew A Procassini, president of the US Semiconductor Industry
Association, reacted to the results with strong words. 'Japan's commitment
to create a more open semiconductor market remains unfulfilled,' Mr
Procassini said.
But Japanese officials expressed satisfaction with the results which show
that 'access to the Japanese semiconductor market has improved,' said Mr
Hidehiko Yoshida, senior vice president of Toshiba and chairman of the Users
Committee of Foreign Semiconductors of the Electronics Industry Association
of Japan.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, the foreign share surged to 20.2 per cent
from 15.9 per cent in the third quarter, leading US trade officials to hail
the US-Japan semiconductor accord as a model which could be adopted in other
sectors.

<TEXT>
THE South African government last night approved the award of two cellular
telephone licences to consortia of local and overseas investors, writes
Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg.
The ANC has protested that the government should not issue licences without
its approval, raising suspicions that the group was trying to delay the
issue to give US and Scandinavian companies a chance to participate once the
ANC has authorised the lifting of sanctions imposed by those countries. Such
a move is likely as early as tomorrow.
Licences went to Vodacom, a consortium in which Vodafone of the UK has a 35
per cent stake along with the public utility Telkom with 50 per cent and
Rembrandt with 15 per cent, and Mobile Telephone Networks, which includes
Cable &amp; Wireless, the local cable company M-Net and a group of black
investors. It is believed that 30 per cent of MTN will be reserved for black
ownership.
Each licence is expected to involve an investment of about R1bn (Pounds
200m), with an estimated R700m coming from abroad.

<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES are negotiating contracts worth up to Pounds 1bn in
Malaysia which could secure 25,000 jobs in the UK, Mr John Major announced
yesterday.
Speaking in Kuala Lumpur before flying to Monte Carlo, the prime minister
said British companies had won a number of multi-million pound projects,
ranging from airport construction to bus manufacturing, and were involved in
'potentially hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts'.
During visits to Japan and Malaysia Mr Major had been unable to escape
domestic political concerns, and it was with obvious relief that he was able
to announce substantial overseas contracts for British companies. British
Gas and Genting Sanyen of Malaysia are to build a 720MW power station under
the country's electricity privatisation programme. The total cost of the
project is put at Pounds 550m. British Gas will take a 20 per cent equity
stake in the project.
An Anglo-Japanese consortium made up of Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty,
Gammon, G-Mats (part of GEC) and Marubeni of Japan have signed a memorandum
of understanding for the development and project management of a new
international airport for Kuala Lumpur.
The total cost of the project is put at MDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 3.5bn).
Those involved say British companies are well placed to win hundreds of
millions of pounds worth of contracts for work on the airport. Trafalgar
House is also to invest about Pounds 13m in a steel fabrication plant in
Malaysia.
The engineering company John Brown, part of the Trafalgar House group, has
won a Pounds 120m turnkey contract to build a 330MW power station on the
outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. John Brown is already involved in the
construction of a 220MW power plant in the south of Malaysia.
Dennis, the British heavy vehicle and bus manufacturer, is forming a joint
venture to manufacture its vehicles in Malaysia.
Lord Prior, GEC chairman and the head of a British trade delegation that
accompanied Mr Major in Malaysia, said he felt the prime minster had
underestimated the potential gain for British companies from the contracts.

MR Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday issued a ringing
defence of the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned that an
opportunity to secure another such pact would not happen for a generation.
If the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada failed to win congressional
approval 'it will be our children negotiating the next Nafta,' he said in a
speech before the American Business Conference.
Both Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance
committee, and Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, have voiced
strong reservations about the pact. They have hinted it might win
congressional approval were it sent back to the White House for
renegotiation.
Mr Kantor characterised Nafta as the administration's top foreign policy
initiative.
For years the US had coped with Mexican tariffs, quotas and performance and
production requirements. 'Why in the world anyone would want to continue
this unfair situation is frankly beyond me. What they are saying is maintain
the status quo,' he said.
Turning to the Uruguay Round, Mr Kantor called French dissatisfaction with
the US-EC farm trade pact, agreed last year at Washington's Blair House, 'an
internal EC matter' in which the US would not get involved. This will not
help Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, when he arrives in
Washington on Monday to request 'clarifications' on the deal.
Uruguay Round negotiations in Geneva had been 'moving quite well,' Mr Kantor
added, although 'the French, of course, have not helped the situation by
raising this Blair House agreement.'
He said in future US trade policy would focus more on Asia where 'we have
not been as successful at building trade regimes around our relationship'.

FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Juggling with gelignite in farm trade
forum - David Marsh and Lionel Barber on the risky search for a US-French
compromise on Blair House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to find a compromise between the US and France over farm trade are
fraught with even greater complexity and risk than last year's EC attempts
to reverse Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
Politicians said that solving the Danish puzzle was like 'multi-dimensional
chess'. Finding a way out of the farm impasse is like chess and juggling
with gelignite.
In the Maastricht negotiations the EC found a face-saving deal to meet
Denmark's demand for exemptions from European union, without causing the
entire treaty to be renegotiated.
In the bid to bridge the agricultural gap between Washington and Paris, US
and EC officials face a still more arduous task.
They have to deliver an agreement which meets the US desire to avoid
reopening the EC-US Blair House farm trade accord reached last November. But
they must also fulfil the Paris government's aim of modifying the accord's
undertaking for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised EC food
exports over six years.
Unless the imbroglio can be solved, hopes for clinching a Uruguay Round
accord by the December 15 dealine will crumble - bringing closer the
prospect of an international trade war.
All participants in the negotiations realise that some of the chief
protagonists' recent hard-line announcements, including the sparring this
week in Brussels, involve a degree of posturing. The difficulty is knowing
whether, and where, the US and French sides will show a willingness to make
concessions.
One insider to the talks said yesterday that a statement on Tuesday by Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, ruling out modifications to Blair
House, was predictable. Mr Kantor, who meets Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's
chief trade negotiator, in Washington on Monday, would not reveal his full
hand until later, the official said.
'They're keeping it for the end-game,' he added. 'We don't know yet the
French bottom line. We have a lot of teasing out to do.'
On Monday night in Brussels, Sir Leon staved off French efforts to change
his negotiating mandate with Mr Kantor. But this was at the expense of a row
with Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and rekindled French fears
that the UK commissioner is a free-trader who is too close to the UK and US.
German officials spent much of Monday night's meeting trying to mediate
between the French and their EC partners. But one German official yesterday
voiced concerns that Sir Leon's confrontation could affect French attitudes
toward the final Gatt settlement, which requires unanimous approval by the
EC.
'He (Sir Leon) was good,' said one senior German official yesterday, 'but
maybe he was too good.'
On the other hand, if Sir Leon can successfully promote a US-French deal the
prospect - at present, rather thin - of pulling off his ambition to succeed
Mr Jacques Delors as the next EC Commission president would improve
dramatically.
The apparent gulf between US and French attitudes has been increased by
intensely political considerations. The US seems fundamentally to mistrust
the content of EC Common Agricultural Policy reforms, designed to cut prices
and production during the 1990s.
And after France's monetary humiliation last month at the hands of the
German Bundesbank and Anglo-Saxon 'speculators', Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French prime minister, badly wants to avoid the spectacle of a climb-down to
US farming interests.
Experts believe there is the possibility, in some important technical areas,
of adding to the Blair House agreement a series of points to meet France's
desire to protect its interests.
For instance, the US could clarify whether EC food stocks should be
considered part of the accord's export cuts, and could also agree a 'peace
clause' ruling out unilateral action against the EC's farm export regime.
Since the US already feels the EC got the better of the Blair House
compromise, room for manoeuvre is constrained. The next few weeks will show
whether there is enough left for all sides in the farm trade conundrum to
declare themselves - however implausibly - the winners.

MR Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, yesterday issued a ringing
defence of the controversial North American Free Trade Agreement and warned
that an opportunity to secure another such pact would not happen for a
generation.
Both Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, and Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, have hinted
that the pact might win Congressional approval if it were sent back to the
White House for renegotiation.
If the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada fails to win Congressional
approve, 'it will be our children negotiating the next Nafta,' Mr Kantor
said in a speech before the American Business Conference.
On Tuesday Mr Gephardt announced his opposition to 'this Nafta'. In a press
conference on Capitol Hill they claimed that the trade pact could still win
approval without the majority leader's support.
Congressman David Skaggs, a Colorado Democrat, warned: 'Anyone who thinks we
need to defeat this because there is something new and better coming down
the road is living in a dream world.' Furthermore the US credibility as a
trade negotiating partner is at stake, he and others cautioned.
The trade representative claimed to be optimistic about Nafta's chances for
passage in the House and characterising the pact as the Administration's top
foreign policy initiative.
For years the US has coped with Mexican tariffs, quotas and performance and
production requirements. 'Why in the world anyone would want to continue
this unfair situation is frankly beyond me. What they are saying is maintain
the status quo. Keep this unfair rules the same.'
Turning to the Uruguay Round, Mr Kantor characterised French dissatisfaction
with the US-EC farm trade pact, agreed last year at Washington's Blair
House, as 'an internal EC matter' in which the US would not get involved.
This hands-off stance will not much help Sir Leon Brittan, the EC
commissioner in charge of trade, when he arrives in Washington next Monday,
to request 'clarifications' of the deal.
'I don't know what clarifications means,' said Mr Kantor. 'But my stomach
starts hurting when anyone says they want clarifications of an already
negotiated and signed agreement.'
He said Uruguay Round negotiations in Geneva have been 'moving quite well'
although 'the French, of course have not helped the situation by raising
this Blair House agreement - I think I'm putting it delicately.'
Mr Kantor said US trade policy will focus more on Asia where 'we have not
been as successful at building trade regimes around our relationship.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US cigarette law attacked as illegal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW US legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to use no more than 25
per cent imported tobacco was yesterday strongly attacked by tobacco
exporting nations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
They claim that the provision, signed into law in August as part of the US
Budget Reconciliation Act, violates Gatt rules forbidding countries to
stipulate the local content of domestic production and will have a severe
impact on tobacco exports to the American market.
The complaint was brought to yesterday's meeting of Gatt's governing council
by Brazil on behalf of Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Thailand, Venezuela
and Zimbabwe, and was supported by Chile, Argentina and Canada. The EC, the
Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) and Australia also expressed
concern.
The US said it would hold formal consultations with its critics next week.
This marks the first step in Gatt's formal disputes procedure, which could
eventually lead to the establishment of an independent panel inquiry.
The law was inspired by Senator Wendell Ford, a Democrat who represents the
tobacco growing state of Kentucky, as part of the horse-trading which
allowed President Bill Clinton's budget plan to squeak through Congress.
Earlier yesterday the Gatt council agreed to set up a disputes panel to
examine Chile's complaint over the EC's licensing and surveillance system
for imported apples.

Failure to conclude the Uruguay Round would undermine the multilateral

FT  23 SEP 93 / Israel looks to peace dividend: Optimism over growth

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, predicts the Israeli economy
will grow by 4 per cent a year over the next five years but could expand
considerably more if the economic dividends of peace come through.
Mr Shochat said latest government figures showed economic growth for 1993 at
4 per cent after last year's record growth of 6.9 per cent. The government,
he said, had successfully tackled the twin problems of unemployment and
inflation, with both expected to drop into single digits early next year.
Nearly 90,000 jobs will have been created by the end of the year, he said.
Mr Shochat, who took over the Finance Ministry after last year's Labour
election victory, said the government was committed to rolling back further
state intervention in the economy through continued privatisation and cuts
in public borrowing through budget deficit reduction.
The sale of the country's government-owned banks, already under way, would
be completed by early 1995, Mr Shochat said, earning the Treasury Dollars
5bn (Pounds 3.26bn) which would cover the budget deficit and leave the money
markets open to the private sector. Trade barriers would continue to be cut
back as the Israeli economy was opened to greater foreign competition.
The government, he said, had been considerably helped, especially in its
expanded infrastructure programme, by the Dollars 10bn US loan guarantees.
Mr Aharon Foegel, the ministry's director general, was yesterday concluding
negotiations with a consortium of New York banks led by Salomon Brothers on
the second tranche for 1993, of Dollars 1bn.
'If you take the reduction in unemployment, increase in industrial exports
of 12 per cent, firm growth and good investment in industry, the performance
of the economy is looking good,' said Mr Shochat, who leaves Israel tomorrow
to attend the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in
Washington.
He said economic performance could be even better if a comprehensive peace
accord with Arab states was reached. In the short term, Israel's economy
would benefit from the huge external aid package planned for the Gaza Strip
and West Bank, particularly in the supply of construction materials. An
immediate benefit to the economy would be a rise in tourists, now 2m a year.
In the longer term Israel could benefit from foreign investment, the
relocation of headquarters of multinational companies to Israel, and trade
with Arab states.

IRAQ yesterday unexpectedly freed three Swedes who were among at least 10
foreign nationals held in Iraqi jails for entering the country illegally.
Their release came after a letter from King Carl Gustaf, calling on Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein to free the men, was delivered in Baghdad.
The three were arrested on September 3 last year after straying across the
border from Kuwait where they were working for Ericsson, the Swedish
telecommunications company, on a contract for the Kuwaiti government to
repair radio base stations. They were given seven-year jail terms.
Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, welcomed news of their release.
Sweden has supplied three tranches of humanitarian aid to Iraq since the men
were arrested. The latest, worth SKr50m (Pounds 4m), was announced in June.
But Sweden's only diplomatic presence in Baghdad since last September has
been two officials working on the case of the Ericsson men.
The release of the three - Mr Stefan Wihlborg, Mr Leif Westberg and Mr
Christer Stromgren - will raise hopes for the other foreigners held on
similar charges, including three Britons.
Ericsson said the three Swedes were treated well during their imprisonment.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Israelis urged to reach deal with Syrians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt yesterday urged Israel to press ahead
swiftly to secure a peace deal with Syria. After three hours of talks in
Alexandria with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, Mr Mubarak said such
progress could be vital to keep up momentum for peace in the region.
The Egyptian leader said he took issue with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, on the pace of negotiations. It was wrong, he said, just to
concentrate on the outline agreement between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
He warned that the complex deal between Israel and the PLO was at such an
early stage that it would be a mistake to wait for it to produce results
before pressing on with the rest of the peace process.
Mr Rabin was reported to have told Mr Mubarak at the weekend that he
preferred to allow the Israeli public time to digest the contents of the
agreement with the PLO before seeking to clinch a deal with Syria. Mr Assad
is demanding that Israel must hand back all of the Golan Heights, captured
in the 1967 war, before he will agree to a peace treaty.
The Syrian leader said yesterday there had been no progress in the bilateral
negotiations with Israel, although all points were open to debate. He has
also made little effort to hide his anger at Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman,
for reneging on a promise to maintain a common Arab front in negotiations
with Israel.
While Mr Assad has said he will not openly oppose the PLO deal, he will do
nothing to check dissension within the Palestinian community. Arab diplomats
said yesterday that future negotiations of the outline PLO-Israel agreement
would stand a substantially better chance of success if Syria understood
that Israel was willing to return the Golan Heights.
The heated debate in the Israeli parliament continued yesterday on the terms
of the Palestinian deal, with the final vote expected today.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Corporate bribe structure starts to crack: Robert Thomson on
changed relations between Japan's politicians and contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a television microphone was rammed in his face and reporters pursued
his black limousine down a Tokyo back street, Mr Teruzo Yoshino, the
patriarch of Japan's construction industry, must have sensed that he was
falling from grace.
The end of courtesy in Japan means the beginning of trouble for accused
politicians and executives, guilty or not, as associates and journalists are
indicating that they no longer feel compelled to cultivate a long-term
friendship.
By arresting the venerable Mr Yoshino, 75, head of the Japan Federation of
Construction Contractors and chairman of Shimizu, the country's leading
construction company, the prosecutors' office is attempting to alter the
terms of a most important friendship, that between the politician and the
contractor.
Mr Yoshino, taken into custody on Monday, and two other Shimizu executives
arrested yesterday - Mr Hirokuki Koyama, a vice-chairman, and Mr Akikazu
Matsumoto, a managing director - are claimed to have given Y10m (Pounds
63,000) to Mr Fujio Takeuchi, former governor of Ibaraki prefecture north of
Tokyo. This was in the alleged hope that their company would win a share of
a planned prefectural complex and medical university.
Before a rush of arrests over the past year, most Japanese were aware that
politicians and contractors had stitched together unsavoury deals.
Politicians provided the projects and the construction companies ensured
their local member had cash to cope with an expensive election campaign.
But the prosecutors' office was surprised by the depth of personal
corruption uncovered during investigations. Tolerance of illegal links was
based on an understanding that, a few banquets aside, most contractors'
money went on political fighting funds and not into personal bank accounts.
Not that Mr Yoshino was guilty of excess, nor necessarily of anything else,
though the Construction Ministry has already suspended Shimizu from bidding
for public works contracts for four months. 'I would never do anything as
silly as attempt to bribe someone,' insisted Mr Yoshino shortly before his
detention.
Wedged between two investigators, Mr Yoshino, without the dignity of a tie,
was driven to the Tokyo Detention Centre and took with him the reputation of
Japan's construction industry, allegedly corrupt in its collusion and
competition to win contracts.
US criticism of Japan's construction market has been aimed at the collusion
embodied in dango, the cartels which traditionally organised the outcome of
contract awards. But the 18 arrests arising from alleged corruption in
prefectures north of Tokyo can be traced to the breakdown of industry
collusion and the outbreak of fierce competition.
Leading contractors admit to courting Mr Takeuchi, who resigned as Ibaraki's
governor after having been charged with receiving Y55m in bribes. Mr
Yoshino, who went to the same high school as Mr Takeuchi, says he visited
Ibaraki after learning that executives from rival companies had done the
same in the hope of winning contracts.
The executives were right to respect the influence of Mr Takeuchi, who is
said to have informed officials presiding over contract awards that 'I met
Mr X of Y company and he is a wonderful guy'. Prosecutors have leaked
details of restaurant dinners at which an empty shopping bag was allegedly
left behind for a contractor to pay financial tribute to the then governor.
By targeting Mr Yoshino, the prosecutors were suggesting that the pre-bid
bidding for the Ibaraki governor's favours was a national trend which had to
be stopped. The prosecutors judged that a lower-profile investigation into
lesser officials would not have the necessary impact on politicians or their
contractor friends.
Having struck at Shimizu, the prosecutors are concentrating on two other
leading companies. The campaign is directed more at a corporate culture than
at individuals, but companies are often quick to disown executives taken
into custody.
As Mr Yoshino knows, regardless of his guilt, the next stage of his fall
will come if the company suggests that he acted alone and that it 'regrets'
the incident. Shimizu is still defending the chairman: 'We had conducted an
internal investigation into the bribery allegations and we cannot believe
that they are true.'
Industry specialists said Shimizu, which receives just under a fifth of its
total orders from the public sector, could miss out on contracts worth as
much as Y100bn. However, that figure does not include potential losses from
private clients now unwilling to hire the company.
The arrest of the Shimizu executives puts added pressure on the Construction
Ministry to devise a bidding process for public works projects that gives
value for money and ensures fairer competition. US officials want an end to
a system in which bidders are designated by government officials, who are
supposed to use technical competence, safety records and financial health,
not conviviality, as their guide.
The Construction Ministry says the designated system ensures that only
qualified companies compete for projects, but it has never made clear how
companies are assessed, making the system prone to abuse. If the prosecutors
have their way, the ministry will be more open about the designation process
and less open to overtures from politicians.

will grow by 4 per cent a year over the next five years but could expand
considerably more if the economic dividends of peace come through.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Shochat said latest government

to drop into single digits early next year.
Nearly 90,000 jobs will have been created by the end of the year, he said.
Mr Shochat, who took over the Finance Ministry after last year's Labour
election victory, said the government was committed to rolling back further
state intervention in the economy through continued privatisation and cuts
in public borrowing through budget deficit reduction.
The sale of the country's government-owned banks, already under way, would
be completed by early 1995, Mr Shochat said, earning the Treasury Dollars
5bn (Pounds 3.26bn) which would cover the budget deficit and leave the money
markets open to the private sector. Trade barriers would continue to be cut
back as the Israeli economy was opened to greater foreign competition.
The government, he said, had been considerably helped, especially in its
expanded infrastructure programme, by the Dollars 10bn US loan guarantees.
Mr Aharon Foegel, the ministry's director general, was yesterday concluding
negotiations with a consortium of New York banks led by Salomon Brothers on
the second tranche for 1993, of Dollars 1bn.
'If you take the reduction in unemployment, increase in industrial exports
of 12 per cent, firm growth and good investment in industry, the performance
of the economy is looking good,' said Mr Shochat, who leaves Israel tomorrow
to attend the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in
Washington.
He said economic performance could be even better if a comprehensive peace
accord with Arab states was reached. In the short term, Israel's economy
would benefit from the huge external aid package planned for the Gaza Strip
and West Bank, particularly in the supply of construction materials. An
immediate benefit to the economy would be a rise in tourists, now 2m a year.
In the longer term Israel could benefit from foreign investment, the
relocation of headquarters of multinational companies to Israel, and trade
with Arab states especially in Israeli exports such as irrigation equipment
and electricity and communications goods.
Mr Shochat said a team in the ministry was busy preparing to implement the
economic aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. But he said it
was important the Palestinians adopt a harmonised tax, excise and customs
policy with Israel. 'If there is no harmonisation of taxes and customs we
will have to put restrictive controls at the border,' Mr Shochat said.

FT  23 SEP 93 / IOC team ready to award biggest prize: Lobbyists stalk the
Olympics committee like exotic game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the International Olympic Committee know what it is to be hunted.
In the lobbies and corridors of Monaco's five-star hotels they are stalked
by representatives of bidding cities like rare and exotic game.
On the eve of the IOC's decision tonight on the choice of city for the 2000
Olympics, the chairman of one city's campaign yesterday described the IOC
members as 'in purdah'. The ballot of these 91 individuals will award a
prize worth billions of dollars and immeasurable international prestige.
Even the appearance of a member such as Panama's Mr Virgilio de Leon, at 74
only one year from mandatory retirement, can signal the instant arrival of
eight or nine eager Beijing publicists, piling in like a rugby scrum at a
ruck. Cities such as Manchester or Sydney may be more discreet in their
wooing but the thrust of effort is the same.
When Greg Norman won the Open golf championship, the Sydney campaign quickly
put signed photographs of the Australian golfer in the post to every IOC
member known to enjoy 18 holes.
As a group the IOC is predominantly white, elderly, male and from the Old
World. A total of 38 members are from Europe, only four of them women. Of
these two are princesses, the Princess Royal from Britain and Princess Nora
of Liechtenstein.
Other royal members include the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Prince Albert
of Monaco. Membership of the IOC is by invitation and then election by the
full membership. At the Barcelona games 170 countries took part but fewer
than half of these had nationals on the IOC.
It is often said to be the best and most exclusive club in the world.
Members travel first class to their many meetings and conferences and stay
free of charge in the world's best hotels.
Even 20 years ago it was very different. 'When I first became a member we
paid all our own expenses and it was often difficult to afford to attend
different events,' said Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, who has been
the spearhead of the IOC's campaign against drugtaking.
The executive board, the powerhouse of the IOC, is headed by Mr Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the retired Spanish diplomat, who is its president. His key
lieutenants are businessmen.
Mr Richard Pound, 51, is a punchy Montreal lawyer and former Olympic
swimmer. His marketing expertise and skilled negotiation of television
rights have brought the IOC's finances from penury to assets of Dollars 125m
in the past decade.
Mr Kevan Gosper, an Australian oil executive, is another vice-president with
a professional background. Ten years older than Mr Pound, he may have missed
his chance to succeed Samaranch, but his egalitarian style has been crucial
in changing the IOC's approach to the world.
This meritocracy within an anachronistic elite is reinforced by the
distinguished presence of Mr Keba Mbaye, a retired Senegalese judge and
international jurist. Mr Justice Mbaye has enormous influence within the IOC
and was pivotal in the process which led to South Africa being readmitted to
the Olympics.
His undoubted probity has also been important in the IOC reforming dubious
aspects of the bidding process. During the 1980s, candidate cities
notoriously handed out gifts such as fur coats and expensive jewellery to
IOC members and their wives. Air tickets to inspect facilities were routed
through the most exotic, out-of-the-way locations.
These kind of excesses, harshly criticised both by outsiders and such
insiders as the Princess Royal, have disappeared. But a waitress at a
Manchester bid reception, heaping smoked salmon on to the IOC plates, was
still able to observe: 'If there is reincarnation, I want to come back as
part of the IOC.'

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S parliament is due to vote today on legislation to end
exclusive white rule, against a background of mounting political violence
including two massacres on Tuesday night which left at least 30 blacks dead.
Parliament is expected to approve the Transitional Executive Council bill,
which will set up a multi-racial advisory council to oversee the transition
to democratic elections next April.
MPs from the ultra-right Conservative party disrupted parliament yesterday,
and several were suspended, but the party does not command sufficient votes
to block the legislation unless MPs of the ruling National party rebel.
Passage of the bill is the key to lifting remaining international economic
sanctions against South Africa. Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress
president, is expected to react to the bill's passage by calling for
remaining non-military sanctions to be lifted when he addresses the United
Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid in New York tomorrow.
Mr Mandela, President FW de Klerk and other black and white leaders are
launching a drive in the US to attract business and investment to South
Africa.
Passage of the bill will not immediately bring the Transitional Executive
into existence, however: the bill will not be promulgated - and thus will
have no force - until agreement has been reached on a new constitution, a
process which could still take months.
Tension remained high in the black townships of Thokoza and Katlehong, where
most of those killed in recent violence have died. Roads were barricaded and
officials of the Inkatha Freedom Party were attacked by residents after one
of the massacres on Tuesday when gunman shooting at random on a nearby
highway killed 18 people.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Babar Ali, Pakistan's finance minister, is due to meet representatives of
donor countries in Washington on Monday to seek up to Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds
1.7bn) in fresh commitments.
The meeting is a substitute for this year's annual aid-to-Pakistan
consortium meeting which was originally scheduled to be held in Paris. That
meeting had to be cancelled twice because of the country's political
upheavals. A general election is due on October 6.
In recent months some Pakistani officials have been worried that a request
by a short-term unelected government would be to Islamabad's disadvantage.
'Donors may question whether policies will remain intact after the October
elections when a new government comes to office,' said one.
However, recent economic reforms by the government of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the
interim prime minister, have largely been welcomed by donors, western
economists in Islamabad say. Among the reforms are government commitments to
reduce a chronic budgetary deficit, increase spending on the social sector
and reduce tariffs over the next four years.
Mr Qureshi has also said recently that he had received assurances from Mr
Nawaz Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto, the two main prime ministerial
contenders, that his government's policies will not be reversed. In
addition, the IMF has agreed to provide up to Dollars 377m in standby
credits, under a recently negotiated deal. That move is expected to
strengthen Pakistan's case with its donors, officials add.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Litigation grows over accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE companies paid out Dollars 185m (Pounds 121m) in net payments to
settle litigation claims against the six largest US accountancy firms alone
last year, according to figures released yesterday.
The figures - which were compiled from a confidential survey of the US firms
 -increased sharply from net payments by insurers of just Dollars 8m in 1991
and net receipts of Dollars 37m in 1990.
They show the 'Big Six' accountants paid out Dollars 598m net in legal
costs, settlements and insurance premiums, or nearly 11 per cent of total
accounting and auditing revenues of Dollars 5.5bn, up from 9 per cent in
1991 and 8 per cent in 1990.
The information is being used as part of a campaign by Cease, the coalition
to eliminate abusive securities suits, comprising more than 400 accountants
and US businesses lobbying the US government to restructure the legal
system.
Firms surveyed included KPMG Peat Marwick, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte &amp;
Touche, Arthur Andersen, Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse.
Mr Larry Weinbach, managing partner-chief executive of Arthur Andersen
Worldwide Organisation, who has helped co-ordinate the campaign, said
yesterday: 'This is one of the most serious issues facing the accounting
profession since its inception.
'Its future is in jeopardy unless we come up with some reasonable approach.'
He warned that unless there was reform of the existing legal system,
accountants would either be forced out of business or restrict their public
interest role by refusing to conduct audits of some companies. The rising
trend in net insurance payments is echoed by the increasing cost and
difficulty of accountants obtaining insurance .
Mr Weinbach said his firm had been forced to introduce greater
self-insurance because it was unable to obtain commercial cover at
affordable rates.
It wants plaintiffs who take out legal cases against accountants to be
forced to pay the defendants' costs if they lose, as is the case in the UK.

FT  23 SEP 93 / IDA contribution withheld: World economic outlook

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A KEY congressional committee has withheld full authorisation for the
Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.43bn) US contribution to the International
Development Association, the World Bank unit that provides loans at low
interest rates to the poorest developing countries.
The House of Representatives banking committee voted yesterday to allow the
US to sign the IDA replenishment agreement reached last year, but to
authorise only the first two Dollars 1.25bn tranches of the US contribution.
This limited authorisation follows protracted talks with the US Treasury and
the World Bank over improvements in transparency of bank operations.
Both Treasury and World Bank officials had hoped recent changes in portfolio
management and disclosure policy, as well as the decision to set up an
independent inspection panel, would be enough to win a full three-year
authorisation. But Mr Barney Frank, chairman of the subcommittee overseeing
the World Bank, said there was still uncertainty over how the reforms would
work out.
The bill would also authorise the US to write off developing country debts.

NEW US legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to use no more than 25
per cent imported tobacco was yesterday strongly attacked by tobacco
exporting nations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
They claim that the provision, signed into law in August as part of the US
Budget Reconciliation Act, violates Gatt rules forbidding countries to
stipulate the local content of domestic production and will have a severe
impact on tobacco exports to the American market.
The complaint was brought to yesterday's meeting of Gatt's governing council
by Brazil on behalf of Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Thailand, Venezuela
and Zimbabwe, and was supported by Chile, Argentina and Canada.
The US said it would hold formal consultations with its critics next week.
This marks the first step in Gatt's formal disputes procedure, which could
lead to an independent panel inquiry.

FT  23 SEP 93 / IMF urges reductions in interest rates across EC: World
economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rates must be eased across Europe to halt recession and ensure
recovery during 1994, the International Monetary Fund says.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF says that Europe needs a
'mutually reinforcing process of economic recovery in which the restoration
of confidence and rebound of activity in each country supports similar gains
in the others.'
The best way forward, the IMF argues, is through lowering interest rates.
A progressive easing of monetary conditions in those countries which are
members of the European exchange rate mechanism would have positive effects
on business and consumer confidence.
In its report, the International Monetary Fund does not conceal its
disapproval of the way in which continental European countries have
maintained what it sees as over-restrictive monetary policies during the
past year because of their adherence to the European Monetary System .
Although couched in diplomatic language, the Outlook underlines the IMF's
dislike of over-cautious interest rate reductions on the continent since the
decision early in August to increase the fluctuation margins in the ERM to
15 per cent either side of central rates.
In a thinly-disguised attack on the policies of Germany's trading partners,
the IMF warns that 'to maintain excessively high real interest rates to
avert some exchange rate depreciation in the short run would further delay
recovery, increase the risk of additional fiscal policy slippages, fuel
protectionist pressures and might even trigger larger speculative attacks
that could lead to larger exchange rate adjustments.'
The report said that financial markets had already produced 'important
evidence' that moderate but significant reductions in short-term European
interest rates relative to those in Germany would cause only limited
currency depreciations against the D-Mark.
Lower interest rates in the ERM countries would also benefit other
continental European countries as well as the newly emerging market
economies of eastern and central Europe and those African countries which
have close trading ties with Europe, the IMF said.

FT  23 SEP 93 / West's budgetary trends unsustainable: World economic
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENT budgetary trends in many big industrialised countries are
unsustainable, according to the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook.
It warns that the overall budget deficit among industrialised countries is
expected to reach 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year, about
the same as the previous record in 1982.
In recent years public debt burdens have risen sharply and many countries
have almost lost the ability to use fiscal policy as a tool to stabilise
their economies.
According to the IMF: 'Major additional efforts are necessary to achieve
fiscal sustainability as well as broader economic objectives', such as the
restoration of adequate national savings rates and higher growth.
The fund argues the large fiscal deficits 'need to be addressed with a
considerable degree of urgency'. It says high real long-term interest rates
and lacklustre growth can be traced back to high deficits.
Although the IMF acknowledges many countries have either proposed or adopted
'significant deficit-reduction measures', it warns that most of these
efforts 'will not be sufficient to restore fiscal sustainability over the
medium term'.
Failure to reduce structural deficits during the growth years of the 1980s
has made the job of governments more difficult. However, the IMF believes
'gradual, but cumulatively substantial' deficit reductions are possible
without jeopardising global economic recovery.
A brief survey of the leading industrial countries emphasises the problems,
however.
Achievement of the US administration's budget reduction efforts will still
leave a deficit of 2.75 per cent of GDP in the 1998 fiscal year;
Germany's deficit reduction plans are based on over-optimistic economic
assumptions;
Britain, France and Italy face structural budget deficits of respectively
3.5 per cent, 2 per cent and 5 per cent of GDP a year over the medium term.
The IMF says it is not sufficient to stabilise present levels of public debt
to GDP: instead, governments should aim gradually to reduce debt ratios over
time.
Such a goal is all the more necessary because measures of government
indebtedness understate the extent of the problem. The IMF says government
debt figures do not include future entitlements to pensions in public
pension schemes.
It warns that it will be necessary for countries either to increase
borrowing or taxes when social insurance assets are drawn down to fulfil
pension obligations.
Unemployment is also taking a fiscal toll on the industrialised world.
The fund estimates that unemployment benefits accounted for 3.5 per cent of
total government spending in the industrial countries in 1991. They have
since risen with the lengthening of dole queues.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Uncertain prospects for a world recovery: Peter Norman on
the latest mixed outlook for economic growth - World economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world economy will register its fourth successive year of inadequate
growth in 1993 and the prospects for recovery next year are uncertain, the
latest World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund makes
clear.
The Fund expects economic growth in the industrialised countries to weaken
this year to 1.1 per cent, from an already modest 1.7 per cent in 1992.
Although the IMF forecasts that growth in the industrialised world will
recover to 2.2 per cent next year, it warns that the strength and timing of
the pick-up remain unclear.
It is only because of strong growth in the developing world that the IMF has
left its 1993 forecast for world economic growth unchanged, at 2.2 per cent,
since its last Economic Outlook at the end of April. It has revised down by
just 0.2 percentage points, to 3.2 per cent, its forecast for global growth
next year, reflecting expectations of continued robust growth in Asia, parts
of the Middle East and much of Latin America.
But the Fund is now far gloomier about economic prospects in Japan and
France than it was five months ago.
In Japan, recent indicators suggest that recovery stalled in the spring. In
Europe, recovery is unlikely to begin before late 1993 or early 1994, while
growth in north America is weaker than expected.
Unemployment has risen to 'intolerable levels' in industrial countries, the
IMF says. At over 32m, the number of jobless in the industrial countries
this year will be equivalent to the working-age populations of Sweden and
Spain combined.
Excess capacity in all Group of Seven countries except the US is higher than
in the recession of the early 1980s. The upshot is likely to be moderate
inflation but higher unemployment, especially in Europe, and increased
protectionist pressures.
However, the IMF has scaled up its expectations of growth in the developing
world by one percentage point this year and 0.4 points in 1994 to 6.1 per
cent and 5.5 per cent respectively. Growth in Asia is forecast to be 8.7 per
cent this year (some two percentage points higher than forecast in May) and
7.1 per cent in 1994.
The IMF expects developing country imports will increase by 9 per cent in
both this year and next after 10 per cent a year in 1991 and 1992.
Those developing countries with successful, market-oriented economic
policies and high domestic savings tend to be growing more than others.
The Fund says two factors lie behind the feeble recovery in the
industrialised world. There has been a painful adjustment to the asset price
inflation of the late 1980s in North America, the UK, Australia and now
Japan. In Europe, the consequences of German unification and the slow
progress on cutting interest rates by countries in the exchange rate
mechanism have delayed recovery.
But the IMF believes there is some reason for cautious optimism that the
world economy will gradually strengthen. It hopes countries will pursue
policies to reduce their fiscal deficits, providing scope for monetary
policy to be relaxed and give temporary support to activity, especially in
Europe.
The three Japanese fiscal packages since December last year should help
support activity in Japan over the rest of this year and in 1994, it says.

FT  23 SEP 93 / UK 'must make further cuts in budget deficit': World
economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will have to make further efforts to cut its budget deficit in
addition to the tax increases and public spending restraint already planned
for 1994-1995, the International Monetary Fund warns.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, it says that the structural part of
the budget deficit (that part not caused by recession) has increased sharply
to about 5 per cent of gross domestic product this year.
Although the Fund expects the structural deficit to fall 'significantly'
next year, because of budget measures already decided, it is expected to
average about 3.5 per cent of GDP over the medium term.
The IMF pinpoints the rise in public spending as a share of GDP from 38 per
cent to 44 per cent over the past four years as a cause of the UK's
structural budget problem.
Mr Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief economist and head of its research
department, said yesterday that Britain should reduce it deficit by action
on both the spending and the revenue sides of the budget.
Reducing the deficit over the rest of the decade 'will be essential for
growth to be sustained and for inflationary expectations to continue to
moderate,' the IMF says.
In spite of the deficit worries, the IMF is more bullish about the UK's
current economic performance than it was when it published its last Economic
Outlook at the end of April. Britain is the only G7 country for which the
IMF has revised upwards its growth forecast for this year.
The Fund now expects growth in the UK to be 1.8 per cent this year, against
expectations of 1.4 per cent growth in the spring.
The Fund says that the lowering of interest rates and improved
competitiveness that followed the decision to float sterling a year ago
helped turn an incipient recovery into a moderate expansion.
As the recovery gains momentum, growth is expected to rise to 2.8 per cent
next year. This, however, will be a slightly less buoyant performance than
the 3.1 per cent growth forecast for 1994 at the end of April.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Last ditch moves on healthcare bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton called leaders of both parties to the White House
yesterday, for a final discussion on healthcare reform before he unveiled
his proposals in a speech to both houses of Congress last night.
Both Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary, who has headed the White House
healthcare task force, have spent the last week expressing readiness to
compromise on virtually all aspects of their proposal.
And despite months of planning, many details of the programme, particularly
how it will be paid for, have still not been determined.
Legislative texts are not expected to be sent to Congress until the
beginning of next month, and even the most optimistic do not expect the
reform to be passed before next spring.
Mrs Hillary Clinton this week set a still more modest timetable, predicting
only that a bill would be ready to sign into law within a year.
This would be perilously close to next year's congressional elections and
could endanger the spirit of compromise now prevailing between the political
parties.
The core of Mr Clinton's plan is the promise of universally guaranteed
health insurance by the end of 1997. But Mrs Clinton this week said she
would be 'open to talk about' a slower phase-in of universal coverage.
Most people would be enrolled in 'health alliances' which would broker a
limited range of government-regulated health plans for members.
All employers would have to pay 80 per cent of premiums for their workers,
although premiums would be subsidised for small companies. The plan
envisages spending Dollars 160bn (Pounds 104bn) over the next seven years on
these employer subsidies, Dollars 80bn to expand coverage of long term care
and Dollars 72bn to pay for prescription drugs under the Medicare programme
for the elderly.
Offsetting this, Mr Clinton hopes to save Dollars 285bn on existing
government health programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid, and to raise
Dollars 105bn from 'sin taxes', mostly from an increased tobacco tax,
although the precise details have still not been fixed.
The US public is still uncertain and divided about healthcare reform. A
recent Gallup poll showed that while 70 per cent of those questioned were
satisfied with their own coverage, 90 per cent believed US healthcare was in
crisis.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Italy's judges are brought to book: The only surprise is
that it has taken so long
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE courts in Rome have been dubbed 'the gateways to the mists'. This is a
euphemism for the way proceedings are manipulated to create a fog of
confusion in any prosecution, so preventing the truth from emerging.
As a former chief prosecutor in Rome, Mr Claudio Vitalone has been long
linked to some of the most notorious examples of obfuscation. He is now
being investigated on charges of perjury that relate to the murkier aspects
of the Italian judicial system and its manipulation by political masters.
That the investigative magistrates should get round to examining members of
their own profession is not surprising in the current anti-corruption
climate. The only surprise is that it has taken so long. Compliant judges
have played an essential role in protecting the corrupt politicians and
their friends from prosecution - including those in the Mafia.
So far this year an appeals court judge has been suspended because of
suspected links with the Sicilian Mafia and at least three Naples judges
have been suspended because of suspected links with organised crime. But the
Vitalone case, more than any other, underlines the extent to which the
separation of powers during Italy's discredited First Republic has become a
fiction.
Mr Vitalone is accused of perjury in connection with the murder in 1979 of
Mr Mino Pecorelli, the editor of OP, a magazine that specialised in inside
information on the government and security services. His lawyers say he is
innocent.
He is a close associate of Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former Christian
Democrat prime minister, who faces charges of approving the Pecorelli
murder. Mr Andreotti was questioned again on Tuesday about this murder. Rome
magistrates allege Mr Pecorelli was killed by Mafia-sponsored hit-men
because he knew too many secrets, including those surrounding the death of
Mr Aldo Moro, the Christian Democrat premier kidnapped by Red Brigades
terrorists.
Only days before Mr Pecorelli was murdered, Mr Vitalone helped organise a
dinner during which the journalist was persuaded to replace OP's cover
story, which contained scurrilous insinuations about Mr Andreotti's
financial dealings. Both Mr Andreotti and Mr Vitalone are alleged to have
been friendly with the Salvo cousins, prominent Sicilian businessmen linked
to the Mafia, who are said to have organised the killing. Their connection
with the now dead Salvo cousins is central to the magistrates' case.
The perjury charge, made last week, arose from magistrates cross-checking a
statement of July 22 in which Mr Vitalone denied any connection with the
Salvos and the Pecorelli murder.
Mr Vitalone is credited with having over-hastily closed the books on
investigations into the 1970 abortive coup by Prince Valerio Borghese, as
well as other cases such as the 'Gladio' affair (right-wing elements in the
armed forces and security services using the cover of secret Nato resources
to destabilise the country). Mr Vitalone also played a prominent part in
advising the government during the Moro kidnap - and the circumstances
surrounding the negotiations with the late premier's kidnappers remain a
mystery.
Backed by Mr Andreotti, he left judicial office to become a Christian
Democrat senator in 1979. Subsequently Mr Andreotti chose him as his
minister of foreign trade. The perjury charge came on the day the Higher
Judicial Council (CSM) approved his return from politics to the judicial
ranks. A majority of the 33-strong CSM agreed he could take up a post in the
Florence public prosecutor's office, even though he was already under
investigation for alleged corruption relating to aid to Albania. He and his
lawyer brother Wilfredo are also contesting charges of fraudulent
bankruptcy.
His readmission to judicial office has provoked such an outcry that the
justice ministry has been obliged to seek a freeze on Mr Vitalone's posting.
This in turn has thrown the spotlight on the composition of the CSM and the
continued influence of the discredited traditional political parties over
it. The likes of the investigative magistrates in Milan, who have done so
much to inject energy and integrity into the judicial system, are by no
means in the majority.
Only two weeks ago Mr Diego Curto, deputy head of the Milan courts, who has
handled some of the most important financial cases of recent years, was
arrested on charges of abuse of office and corruption. He is in prison,
accused of receiving L400m (Pounds 166,000) for his part in the 1990 buy-out
at an inflated price by Eni, the state oil company, of Ferruzzi-Montedison's
stake in their joint chemicals venture, Enimont. Mr Curto admitted he had
received money for rigging the deal but had thrown the notes into the
rubbish bin. Last week the funds were traced to a Swiss bank account.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Worner wary on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators,
yesterday met Nato officials in Brussels to gather support for a Nato
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, writes Gillian Tett. But after meeting the
mediators, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, insisted that Nato
would not send troops to Bosnia indefinitely and would need clear military
goals before any deployment.
His comments came as the mediators warned that the peacekeepers could become
involved in the fighting.
Although Nato has said it could deploy 50,000 peacekeepers, on top of the
15,000 UN protection forces already in the former Yugoslavia, no firm
decision has been taken, and some alliance officials remain wary of engaging
in a conflict which could potentially undermine Nato's credibility.

DOZENS of passengers were feared killed last night after a Georgian airliner
carrying about 100 people was shot down near the besieged city of Sukhumi,
Reuter reports from Tbilisi.
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's staff could only confirm that 26
people, including six crew, escaped before the burning TU-154 airliner
exploded on the runway at Sukhumi after being hit by a heat-seeking missile.
It was the second plane shot down at the airport in two days.
The 75 passengers were soldiers being brought in for the defence of Sukhumi
against advances by Abkhaz separatists. Land connections have been severed.
On Tuesday, a Tupolev Tu-134 airliner carrying at least 25 people was shot
down as it came in to land at Sukhumi. The aircraft plunged into the sea
short of the airport and the defence ministry has been unable to give
details of the fate of those on board.

FT  23 SEP 93 / East German property law comes under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DRAFT law on compensating former property owners in eastern Germany is
unconstitutional and the entire question will have to be reconsidered,
according to Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony.
The question of land compensation has plagued eastern Germany's five states
for three years. Any further delay in resolving the dispute is likely to
hold up investments in the states. Fewer than a quarter of the 1.2m claims
on 2.63m titles have been resolved.
Mr Biedenkopf's comments are likely to fuel the debate on compensation in
Bonn.
He said in an interview that 'efforts to legislate compensation for
expropriation in eastern Germany went against the wall of constitutionality'
because all property was not being treated equally before the law.
Those who had property confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, and
by the Communists between 1949 and 1990 are entitled to full restitution and
compensation. But those whose property was expropriated between 1945 and
1949, when eastern Germany was under Soviet jurisdiction, have no right to
restitution and only limited compensation.
Mr Biedenkopf's criticisms of the draft legislation follows a special
hearing of 70 lawyers and associations of the Bundestag's finance and legal
committee. During last week's two-day hearing, there were faint hopes a bill
setting out how to finance those whose property was confiscated would be
accepted. But several lawyers said it was unconstitutional and may be
referred to the Constitutional Court if the Bundestag passes the
legislation.
The constitutional issue stems from the way compensation will be financed.
The draft law states that those who have already got their property back
must contribute to a special Compensation Fund totalling DM12.5bn (Pounds
5bn).
The amount they are required to pay is a third of the rateable value of land
in 1935. In addition, depending on whether the property is land, a house, or
a shop, this sum will be multiplied, in some cases by a factor of 10. After
five years, the claimant must pay that sum to the Finance ministry,
otherwise the property might be sold.
Those who have got their property back argue it is unfair they should be
penalised by having to subsidise the compensation fund.
But those seeking compensation are just as angry. They are entitled to
receive the maximum of DM950,000 in compensation, regardless of the current
market value of their property. They argue that this is unconstitutional
because property is not treated equally before the law.

<TEXT>
NATO should consider carefully before enlarging its membership to include
former Warsaw Pact countries in central Europe, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British
defence secretary, said in Moscow yesterday.
He expressed clear UK reservations about an early move to integrate Poland,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.
Enlargement is set to be a central issue at the Nato summit in January.
The UK is taking a notably more cautious line than has recently emerged in
the US and Germany, particularly from Germany's outspoken defence minister,
Mr Volker Ruhe.
Mr Rifkind told the Russian General Staff Academy: 'Membership of Nato
involves responsibility as well as rights and cannot just be seen as a
political statement or as a means of enhancing the security of any one
individual country.'
Nato had to seek stability throughout Europe and must not create 'new areas
of contention and mistrust,' he said. His remarks were partly aimed at
reassuring Russian military leaders, who are concerned about the expansion
proposals.
President Boris Yeltsin, on recent visits to Warsaw and Prague, indicated
that Russia had no objection if central European countries decided to join.
However, these remarks are widely viewed in Moscow to have been
ill-considered. Senior Russian defence officials see any move to incorporate
former Warsaw Pact members as premature. Such a move is seen as a potential
provocation to political hardliners.
Dr Alexander Savelyev, vice-president of the Institute for National Security
and Strategic Studies, said there were 'powerful groups' within Russia who
would not accept an eastwards expansion of Nato.
Mr Rifkind said there could be no question of seeking to isolate Russia.
'There is no strategy of encirclement and, if there were, the UK would have
no part in it,' Mr Rifkind assured his audience of Russian officers.
The January summit would have to consider the alliance's relations with all
other European states, including Russia, he said.

Mr Zvyagilsky, a proponent of increased state involvement in the economy,

Mr Kravchuk had hinted during parliamentary debate this week that he could
name an acting premier, as President Boris Yeltsin did in Russia last year,
to help speed introduction of economic reforms.
'This is not a final decision. Everything will depend on how events develop,
especially on the date of new elections which parliament is to determine,'
presidential spokesman Volodymyr Shlyaposhnykov said.
Mr Zvyagilsky, 60, was a first deputy prime minister in Kuchma's outgoing

LORD Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators,
yesterday met Nato officials in Brussels to gather support for a Nato
peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
But after meeting the mediators, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general,
insisted that Nato would not send troops to Bosnia indefinitely and would
need clear military goals before any deployment.
His comments came as the mediators warned that the peacekeepers could become
involved in the fighting.
Although Nato has said it could deploy 50,000 peacekeepers, on top of the
15,000 UN protection forces already in the former Yugoslavia, no firm
decision has been taken, and some alliance officials remain wary of engaging
in a conflict which could potentially undermine Nato's credibility.
The Croatian government yesterday said it would ask UN peacekeepers to pull
out of its territory when the UN mandate expires next week, unless the UN
acknowledged Croat demands to disarm Serb forces in the republic.

FT  23 SEP 93 / French budget aims to reflate economy

THE French government yesterday unveiled its 1994 budget plan to give the
recession-hit economy a modest boost, using tax cuts and incentives to
encourage investment and consumption and privatisation proceeds to reduce
the budget deficit.
But Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, admitted the government had
reduced its estimate of recovery in consumer spending next year to 0.7 per
cent, even though he insisted that France's economic situation 'is not
getting any worse'.
The government is sticking to its forecast that the economy will recover
from an estimated 0.8 per cent drop in gross domestic product this year to
grow by a real 1.4 per cent in 1994. But this improvement would be largely
due to a pick-up in foreign demand for French goods, he said.
The chief measures outlined by Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, call
for:
An increase in overall spending in 1994 of 1.1 per cent, below the predicted
inflation rate of 2.2 per cent. Higher increases are targeted towards
classic conservative priorities, including defence and police, but also for
fighting unemployment.
A reduction in the budget deficit to bring it down from an estimated
FFr317bn (Pounds 36.1bn) this year to FFr300bn next year. The government is
counting on getting FFr55bn from the sale of state companies next year, up
from its planned gains from privatisation of FFr43bn this year.
Some FFr19bn in tax cuts, mainly to provide relief for the middle classes.
They form the centre-right government's main political constituency and bear
the brunt of a steeply progressive income tax that is paid by only half of
French households. The top tax rate would stay at 56.8 per cent, but tax
brackets would be simplified and reduced from 13 to seven. Fiscal reforms
aimed at shifting French savings towards housing, consumption and
longer-term deposits. The Association of French Banks welcomed the move as
'a step towards a more logical savings system', but was disappointed that
some measures would not take effect until 1995.
More immediate will be the impact of removal of capital gains tax on Sicav
money funds which are withdrawn for investment in housing. Economists said
this would revive the depressed housing sector.
The budget package evoked little enthusiasm, even from government
supporters. The UDF described it as 'the least worse outcome that is
possible in very difficult circumstances'. The Socialist opposition
denounced the tax cuts as 'bluff' because they hid larger tax increases
which the government had consolidated into its new budget.
Many economists believe that the tax cuts and incentives alone are too
modest to pull the economy out of recession.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Brussels agrees protection plan for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday approved proposals for protecting
investors in stocks and shares whose savings are at risk through shaky or
bankrupt investment firms.
The scheme would require minimum coverage of Ecu20,000 (Pounds 15,470) as a
safeguard for stock investors throughout the Community.
This would match the limits set under a similar EC-wide bank deposit
guarantee scheme which was agreed by EC ministers a week ago.
EC finance ministers are expected to consider the compensation plan for
stock and shares in the first half of next year. If approved, it would
become effective in January 1996.
This is the date when share dealers will be allowed to operate throughout
the EC, once they are licensed in one of the 12 member states - a move which
the Commission hopes will stimulate the growth of small investors.
Under the Commission proposal, EC member states would repay 90 per cent of
the first Ecu20,000 at risk.
Some member states such as France, Germany and the UK believe that this
limit is too low; however, Commission officials pointed out yesterday that
it would be difficult to change the figure in the light of the bank deposit
guarantee scheme.
'Some banks are involved in selling stocks and shares,' explained one
Brussels official who said the latest proposal reflected the need for
consistency of treatment of banks and investment firms.
The plan would require investment firms to belong to a national compensation
scheme which would then cover all the firm's investment clients, including
those in other member states.
Because the plan sets only minimum cover, EC countries with higher levels of
compensation would be allowed to keep them.
Most EC countries now provide higher protection for stock investors, but
others such as Denmark, Spain and Portugal have no schemes or minimal
compensation.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Privatisation to pay for French tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government said yesterday it planned to raise about FFr50bn
(Pounds 5.69bn) next year on sales of state companies, helping finance a
budget that aims to cut both taxes and the government deficit, Reuter
reports from Paris.
Budget minister Mr Nicolas Sarkozy said the six-month-old conservative
government had put together a 1994 fiscal package to contain spending, give
a boost to the economy and create jobs.
Briefing reporters after presenting the bill to the cabinet, Mr Sarkozy said
he was budgeting for economic growth of 1.4 per cent in 1994. The government
sees a 0.7 per cent shrinkage this year.
The economy slipped into recession in the second half of last year and while
the worst appears to have been left behind, unemployment, now at 11.7 per
cent, is still marching to new highs every month.
Mr Sarkozy had little to add to the budget details that have already
dribbled out in recent weeks.
A government statement said the priorities were 'containing spending. . .
reducing the deficit, supporting economic activity and giving the state the
means to carry out the essential'.
The privatisation drive is due to be led off by banking giant Banque
Nationale de Paris soon and this will be followed by a host of others over
the next five years.
The government is hoping to raise FFr43bn this year and about FFr50bn in
1994.
This will help cut the budget deficit, which has been pumped up by slowing
economic growth over the past two years, by 5.6 per cent to FFr299.7bn next
year.
Government spending will rise by 1.1 per cent next year compared to the
revised 1993 budget drawn up in May - a drop in real terms because consumer
prices are expected to grow at twice that pace.
However, the budgets of the justice, social affairs and education ministries
will all rise by more than 4 per cent. The interior ministry will receive
3.7 per cent extra, with spending on policing rising by 12 per cent.
The government also confirmed that it would be simplifying the horribly
complex income tax system, cutting the number of tax brackets to seven from
13.
Income tax itself will be cut, to the tune of FFr19bn.
More than 90 per cent of taxpayers will see their income tax bills drop by
at least 3 per cent and 44 per cent will pay at least 10 per cent less next
year.
There will also be sweeping changes to tax on savings, designed to entice
savers out of the massively popular money market mutual funds and into
either the stock market, to help companies invest, or into straight consumer
spending.
However, the income tax cuts will fall far short of compensating for July's
rise in the broad-based social security tax, the CSG, to 2.4 per cent from
1.1 per cent.
That tax will raise FFr50bn for the government in a full year.

Olympique Marseille, already barred from defending their European Cup crown,

of their league title for their role in a bribery scandal, Reuter reports
from Paris. French Football Federation president Jean Fournet-Fayard said:
'We had to take sanctions in this affair, which has seriously harmed the
morality of our sport.' Fifa, world soccer's governing body, had threatened
to suspend France from international competitions unless sanctions were
taken by today to end the saga in which three Valenciennes players said they
were offered money by Marseille to throw a league match.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Big PVC maker to lift prices by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVC, the joint-venture between Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK and
the Italian group Enichem, has announced a 10 per cent increase in polyvinyl
chloride prices.
The western European PVC industry has been losing DM1bn (Pounds 400m) a
year, says EVC, Europe's largest PVC manufacturer.
EVC said it was raising the price of grades for pipes to a minimum of DM1.20
a kilogramme, and DM1.25 for other grades from October 1. Prices of pipe
grade PVC slumped from DM1.75 in 1991 to below DM1 last year. The industry
reckons its needs prices of about DM1.45 to break even.
Attempts by west European manufacturers to increase prices by about 30 per
cent last year not only failed but led to a cartel investigation by the
European Commission.
The company justified the latest increase by arguing low European prices had
driven imports away to non-European markets. This had led to an increase in
demand for EVC's products during the summer, it claimed.
The PVC market has been swamped by falling demand and increased imports from
eastern Europe.

GERMAN miners went on strike yesterday to protest against job cuts announced
by recession-hit Ruhrkohle, Germany's largest coal producer.
Miners broke off early from their morning shifts to join fellow workers
protesting in the streets of all major towns in the Ruhr valley, Germany's
industrial heartland.
Most of the miners went back to work in the afternoon, except those from the
Monopol pit at Bergkamen, which will be closed under the plans, and those
from the Niederrhein area, who said they would stay out until Chancellor
Helmut Kohl intervenes.
The miners' anger was prompted by Ruhrkohle's decision on Tuesday to axe an
additional 6,000 jobs next year.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Weapon imports 'source of instability'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY and Greece have become two of the largest importers of big weapons
systems in the last two years, providing another potential source of
instability in the Balkan region, a study claims today.
The research, by the British American Security Information Council, an
independent think tank, says Greece received more weapons systems in 1992
than almost any other country in the world, spending some Dollars 1.9bn
(Pounds 1.23bn) on arms, while Turkey spent Dollars 1.5bn on similar
purchases.
Turkish and Greek officials yesterday denied the figures. However, western
military officials confirmed that both countries had been involved in a
large build-up in recent years, fuelled by donations of second-hand weapons
from other Nato countries.
One Nato official said: 'The figures seem surprising, but there is no doubt
that the transfer of equipment has been the largest in the region.'
In spite of fears that a conflict in the former Yugoslav regions of
Macedonia or Kosova could embroil Greece and Turkey, diplomats cite tensions
between Greece and Turkey are the main reason for the build-up.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Yeltsin gives reformers cause to hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S radical economic reformers, boosted by President Boris Yeltsin's
dissolution of parliament and the return to government this week of radical
economist Yegor Gaidar, are preparing a counter-offensive after the reverses
of recent months.
Although the government stressed it was business as usual, despite what
President Yeltsin's opponents describe as a coup, his decree to replace the
Soviet-era parliament with new elections in December comes at a critical
juncture.
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which had grown increasingly
frustrated by divisions within the cabinet over pursuing radical policies
proclaimed in public, are expected to be encouraged by Mr Yeltsin's
decisiveness.
The timing of the decision is also useful. Russia had promised to sign a
standby agreement with the IMF by October 1 as part of a debt rescheduling
agreed with western creditors. But the latest political crisis, and the
boosting of the reformist camp, will give it much more leeway in dealing
with western institutions.
The IMF and western governments have taken an increasingly cautious stance
towards aiding Moscow since the chaos of the government's abortive currency
reform in early July.
Senior officials of the Group of Seven industrialised countries have for
some time considered the current parliament to be an important obstacle to
economic reform which Mr Yeltsin would have to remove.
In a clear sign of support for Mr Yeltsin, Germany said yesterday it would
today sign a debt-rescheduling deal with Russia to delay payment of capital
and interest on DM8bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of outstanding credits, due since the
end of 1991. In return Russia has agreed to pay some DM500m in outstanding
debt service payments by the end of September, to ensure that German credits
are given the same treatment as those of all other creditors, including US
loans for grain purchases.
Germany has insisted that as the largest official creditor to Russia it
should receive equal treatment. The rescheduling deal is the bilateral
element of the Paris Club agreement reached with the Russian government
earlier this year, allowing repayments to be extended over a further 10
years. Observers closely involved in Russia's reform effort were optimistic
that Mr Yeltsin's willingness to take on his opponents would not undermine
the reform cause and could even accelerate it.
'Mr Yeltsin has finally put economic reform on the line,' said Mr Stanley
Fischer, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and a former chief economist of the World Bank. 'The IMF's tough stance in
recent weeks has had a positive effect because it has helped persuade
Yeltsin that it was time to act, both in getting back Gaidar and confronting
his opposition in parliament. As soon as there is any sign that the
programme is being implemented, the Fund will be back with support.
'If Yeltsin wins, then the reform programme can succeed. If he loses, then
that's it for reform,' Mr Fischer said.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Regions divided over Moscow battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MIXED picture emerged yesterday from Russia's regions as several of the
country's 88 provinces and republics backed Mr Boris Yelstin while others
sought to weigh up the implications of the showdown in Moscow.
Mr Yuri Nozhikov, governor of Siberia's Irkutsk region, said Mr Yeltsin's
decree was unconstitutional by the letter of the law, but he added: 'Is
there any other way out in a situation where parliament does not wish to act
construct-ively?'
Unexpected condemnation came from St Petersburg, Russia's second city, where
the reform-oriented council branded Mr Yeltsin's dissolution of parliament
illegal.
However, many regional officials directly involved in carrying out the
government's market reforms, the most noticeable of which has been its mass
privatisation, warmly endorsed the president's decision.
'He should have done this much earlier,' said Mr Pyotr Lanskov, deputy head
of the St Petersburg privatisation fund. 'I only hope the president has
enough political will to carry out his decree. If he does, Thank God. If he
doesn't, and parliament wins out, that will no doubt mean an end to the
privatisation programme.'
Mr Vyacheslav Silin, deputy chief of the Murmansk administration near Norway
in the far north, said the Supreme Soviet had become 'divorced from
reality'.
'I think the Russian people are wise enough not to start a civil war just
because of a small bunch of people who place their interests above those of
the nation,' he said.
But Mr Boris Nemtsov, governor of the Nizhny-Novgorod region, which is a
pioneer of market reforms, said the present government should take on all
presidential responsibilities until new elections.
The republic of Udmurtia went as far as seizing new rights for itself in
response to the president's decree. It announced that henceforth its laws
would be above those of the Russian government. The bigger republics, such
as Yakutia, and Bashkortostan, have already appropriated sweeping rights for
themselves in the past, while Chechnya has declared its independence.
If Mr Yeltsin wins his battle with parliament, one of the most testing
challenges will be to respond to the long-festering grievances in the
regions, mainly over the sharing of power and resources.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, yesterday promised to seek extra
revenues for provinces, which have considered withholding from Moscow a
larger share of local taxes.
But the promise appears little in relation to the sweeping reforms needed to
transform the so-called Russian Federation into a real federal state.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Dollar slips as markets calmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar yesterday lost much of the ground it had won against the D-Mark
in the immediate aftermath of the Russian crisis as dealers took the view
that events in Moscow would not unsettle western nations or financial
markets.
Shortly after President Yeltsin's announcement that he would be suspending
parliament, there had been a frantic round of dollar buying as dealers
viewed the US currency as a 'safe haven'.
But yesterday, the dollar lost much of the ground it had made up, as dealers
were encouraged by signs that the crisis in Moscow was not spilling onto the
streets.
After peaking at DM1.6475 on Tuesday night, the dollar slipped back to close
in London yesterday at DM1.6285.
Bond markets remained calm for most of the day, as dealers also took the
view that President Yeltsin was winning the power battle in Moscow.
However, there was a frantic round of selling late in Europe by intra day
traders who were seeking to take profits.
Trading in fixed-income markets is expected to remain choppy in the next few
days and investors may yet decide to shift some funds out of Europe if the
Russian crisis shows no signs of being resolved.
Gold trading was also a good deal calmer after a wild response to the
Russian news on Tuesday evening. The price of gold closed at around Dollars
353.95 an ounce.

The creation of a Federation Council, initially comprising the existing
heads of the administrations and parliaments of Russia's 88 regions and
republics.
This would be the top tier of a new, two-chamber parliament to be known as
the Federal Assembly, which would be the supreme legislative body.
Subsequent elections for this new arrangement would supersede the existing
Supreme Soviet and its Congress of People's Deputies.
The 400-member lower house would be the State Duma, of which two thirds
would be elected from individual constituency candidates and a third from
party lists.
The new parliament would adopt a new constitution to lay the legislative
basis for division of powers among parliament, presidency, national
government and regional administration.
New Federation Council, presidental and local elections would then be held.
The president would continue to be head of state and the highest official
(there would be no vice-president). The president would appoint the prime
minister and propose candidates for othertop appointments.
He could dissolve parliament under certain conditions.
The new parliament, unlike the present one, would be strictly limited to
legislative and supervisory powers and no longer be the 'supreme organ of
state power.'

<TEXT>
A RUSSIAN general who had been up all night in emergency meetings as his
country's constitutional crisis unfolded still attended a pre-arranged
meeting with a group of foreign journalists yesterday at the General Staff
Academy in south-west Moscow.
Colonel General Valery Mironov, deputy defence minister in charge of
personnel and training, refused to take sides in the stand-off between
President Boris Yeltsin and General Alexander Rutskoi. The parliament has
also moved to try to oust Gen Mironov's boss, Gen Pavel Grachev, as head of
the Defence Ministry.
Gen Mironov insisted that the armed forces must stay out of the conflict.
After Mr Yeltsin's announcement, he said he managed to contact almost all
the commanders of Russia's military districts. 'I have the opinion that the
majority of servicemen have stated that they are not going to intervene in
these events,' he said.
Top defence officials, in hastily called meetings, issued orders prohibiting
agitation and political activity in military units, Gen Mironov added. His
impression was that these orders had received 'very great support' in the
2m-strong armed forces.
Earlier yesterday Gen Mironov and other senior officers listened politely to
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, when he addressed
military officers at the academy. But there were murmurs of disapproval
among the senior officers as Mr Rifkind expressed forthright support for Mr
Yeltsin. It was not clear, however, whether the disapproval was in response
to interference by a foreigner or to Mr Rifkind's support for Mr Yeltsin.
Mr Rifkind told the Russian top brass: 'The Russian people are clearly at a
vital stage in the development of their democratic institutions.
'Mr Yeltsin's mandate for radical economic and political change has been
regularly thwarted by institutions with fewer democratic credentials than
his own.'
Yesterday, military units were understood to have been placed on alert, with
emphasis on guarding arms depots and nuclear sites. The latter move appeared
to be largely designed to reassure foreign governments, which during the
August 1991 coup attempt became extremely anxious about the command and
control arrangements for nuclear weapons.
Gen Mironov acknowledged that there were grievances within the armed forces,
affected by a loss of prestige, staffing problems and tough economic
conditions. He had himself told Mr Yeltsin of soldiers' complaints about
pay. There had been delay in payment, especially to troops stationed in
other former Soviet republics, and pay had failed to keep up with inflation.
'It is natural that young officers should have doubts about staying in the
service,' he said. He did not rule out political agitation by 'certain
groups of officers and individuals' - but he predicted that there would be
no full-scale movement throughout the forces. 'I do not foresee any
possibility of mass activity in the armed forces.'
Gen Mironov said that despite the difficulties, Russia was still able to
sustain its forces and to manage to restrain servicemen from active
political involvement. The forces still maintained 'a certain combat
capability', he said.
Gen Mironov, 49, graduated from the academy in the same class as Marshal
Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, former head of the forces of the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
For three years he was commander of a motor rifle division on active service
in Afghanistan, an experience which he said had made him extremely wary of
military interventionism.
The academy, which is a grandiose octagonal structure, still stands as a
symbol of Russian military power and confidence.
Its 12 storeys are faced with white marble and its entrances decked with
25-foot mosaics depicting indomitable Soviet heroes.
However, like Russia itself, this senior officers' school is nowadays less
of a fortress, and the military establishment is gradually adapting to the
new political realities.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Reform still selling down on Karl Marx St
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IRKUTSK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KARL Marx Street in the centre of Irkutsk is typical of the market reforms
sweeping Russia's provinces.
Walk into any shop and you will find a wide range goods, which became
available only after the Russian government freed prices and imports in
January last year.
Employees in the corner grocery store, clad in filthy white uniforms, look
and behave much the same as they did before the shop was privatised. A
wall-poster on an elegant pre-revolutionary building advertises evening
courses in accounting, management and 'other skills essential for succeeding
in a market economy'.
But, as in the rest of provincial Russia, continued progress in Irkutsk -
the province and provincial capital 4,000km east of Moscow - has been
threatened by the political battle in Moscow.
Irkutsk has 3m inhabitants, is the size of Turkey, and is in eastern
Siberia, close to the Mongolian border. It is primarily a mineral-rich area,
containing Russia's biggest hard rock gold deposit.
For the shoppers on Karl Marx Street, reform has been harsh and bewildering.
High prices in the shops make all but basic staples unaffordable for many.
But grudging popular support among local people helped to pave the way for
Mr Yeltsin's decision on Tuesday to replace the old-style parliament with
new elections.
Irina, a middle-aged nurse earning Rbs47,000 (Pounds 30) a month, said: 'We
have always been poor. Now we have the freedom to do what we want so at
least that's an improvement. We like Yeltsin, we feel that he's our muzhik
(guy), but you get the impression that they're always throwing a spanner in
the works.' She was referring to the Russian parliament and everybody else
whom President Yeltsin has accused of blocking reforms.
Yevgeny, a young architect, says the present government must be allowed 'to
get on with the job, and then you can judge them.' He added: 'But this way,
nobody is taking responsibility for anything.'
The reaction of Yuri, a worker at a plant beside Lake Baikal, seems to
reflect disenchantment with the spectacle of squabbling politicians. 'The
parliament is in the way and should be got rid of,' he said.
The infighting in Moscow has also meant that a federation treaty that was
due to devolve power to the regions, has not yet been applied. This in turn
has threatened to pull the country apart, with individual regions and
republics competing with each other to transfer as little tax as possible to
the centre while gaining as much power as possible.
While Moscow still determines matters as trivial as fishing and hunting
regulations for Irkutsk's rich lakes and forests, decision-making on more
substantial issues, such as the mining of its rich mineral deposits, is
paralysed.
'No wonder they say laws are not being applied. Moscow can no longer decide
everything from so far away,' says Mr Victor Ignatenko, head of the regional
parliament.
The challenge for Mr Yeltsin is to take up the understandable grievances in
the regions and republics.
Many regions are simply grabbing whatever rights they can in the mean time.
When a few Russian provinces this summer declared themselves 'republics' - a
superior administrative entity designed by the communist authorities to give
ethnic minorities a semblance of statehood - cautious Irkutsk decided
against following their example.

THE posters, lashed to the railings round the White House like cardboard
suffragettes, were violent enough.
'Yeltsin's threat to the Supreme Soviet is a threat to the Russian People]
Enough of this alcoholic] We must strengthen Russia]'; 'The people trust and
support their Supreme Soviet] No to elections] Yeltsinism out of Russia]';
'Zionists and swindlers - out]'.
But the crowd around the White House late yesterday morning, numbering
perhaps 2,000 - 3,000, were more farcical than tragic. Many were elderly. A
little glee-club of women pensioners, sitting behind a banner proclaiming
the Young Communist League, sang Soviet anthems, charmingly. Another lady
recited a poem - passionately patriotic, summoning the spirit of Russia from
the depths.
Several circles were simply being informed by the more learned of their
number as to what was happening. A lady held out a bucket to gather
small-denomination notes in support of the people manning the 'barricades' -
mainly constructed out of rusting radiators, of which the defenders must
have found a store.
The sun shone, the air was mild.
There were many red Soviet banners, but more black yellow and white Imperial
standards, and St Andrews' crosses - the standard red white and blue Russian
flag evidently regarded as that of the enemy. Several men were writing up
lists of supporters or future combatants - one young man held a placard
saying 'soldiers for Rutskoi', but there was no sign of any recruits.
Mr Igor Kressitsky, a pensioner, held a copy of the newspaper Den (the
influential far-right weekly) and regretted the loss of the Soviet Union.
'We were one people, do you understand, and as one people we were great and
we had peace here and peace in the world. Can you deny that? Can you?'
The largest group was laughing. On approach, it was revealed they were
laughing at an improvised play being acted out by an elderly, patriarchal
Russian called Sergei with a white beard and glinting eyes, and a youngish
American called Steve. Sergei was teasing Steve.
'Now, Steve, Steve, listen to me, Russia is not as wretched as it looks.
Even I am not as wretched as I look. Steve, don't be deceived by my
appearance. I am one of a great people. Steve, we threw back the Germans
ourselves. Now we are throwing back the Americans] No, Steve, don't worry,
we are friends, I have the warmest feelings for you, come and drink
something at my house, only unfortunately I have no whisky for you.'
Steve, who spoke some Russian but not enough to parry Sergei in the midst of
a laughing crowd, said something about wishing to be friendly with everyone.
'Steve, this is my idea. My idea. I want you to tell it to the American
Ambassador, what is his name?'
Steve did not know. 'Pickering', I said.
'Picketing, picket (the word is the same in Russian). He is a picket here
with us, the ambassador. How wonderful, he supports us.' (The crowd in
transports of delight).
'You see, Steve, we are all friends, you, me, the American ambassador . . .'
Relieving Steve finally of his embarrassment, Sergei led him out of the
circle of the crowd with every apparent attention of taking him home for a
drink.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Instant fortunes leave Medway dockers dazed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SHEERNESS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOCKS at the port of Sheerness were eerily quiet yesterday evening. A
temporary secretary staffed the phones in the main office. Two large ships
waited to be unloaded but the gantries stood idle.
The beneficiaries of Britain's latest buy-out bonanza were crammed into the
canteen overlooking the docks, hanging on every word about their instant
fortunes from Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive of Medway Ports.
The company, which owns the ports in Chatham and Sheerness, agreed yesterday
to be taken over for Pounds 104m by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company.
Some 300 full-time employees of Medway who backed the Pounds 37m management
and employee buyout of the former Trust port in March 1992 will make a
killing as shareholders. Shares they bought for Pounds 1 are worth Pounds
37.25 each in the takeover.
The average holding, according to Mr Vincent's back-of-an-envelope
calculations, is 2,000 shares, valued at just under Pounds 76,000. One
labourer bought 7,000 shares at Pounds 1 each. He is now worth Pounds
245,000. A friend said: 'He cannot believe it.' The company's four directors
received, between them, shares and cash worth Pounds 20m. Mr Vincent is
Pounds 12m richer from the takeover. 'Even our Mrs Mops are going to get at
least Pounds 25,000 each,' Mr Vincent said yesterday. 'I think everyone will
be drinking champagne for some time to come.'
The sharp increase in the value of the company last night rekindled the
debate over its privatisation price. Ms Joan Walley, Labour's shadow
minister for shipping, called for a ban on the sale of further Trust ports.
The rise reflects the transformation of Medway's performance after a halving
of its workforce and the introduction of new working practices. It employed
600 employees at privatisation, of whom nearly 300 were dockers. Late last
year, 269 dockers opted to take redundancy rather than accept new working
practices. They were required to sell their shares back to the company for
Pounds 2.50 under an independent valuation by KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountants.
But even from the dockers still employed there was no stamping and cheering
as Mr Vincent gave details of the takeover - although the broad smiles
seemed strong enough to disperse the rain clouds. As the employees streamed
out of the meeting, few seemed inclined to resume work.
Steve Craig, a docker who is 20 and single, was elated. He was granted 850
shares. He said: 'How do I feel? How do you think I feel? I might go out and
buy a pub tonight.'
He added: 'No, seriously, it is a one-off, something that happens only once
in your life. I live in a flat. I intend to buy a property and invest the
rest of the money. I want to get more stable.'
Ashley Crichton is 23 and also single. He said: 'I feel as if I had won the
pools. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to do something with my life.'
Both say they will continue working at Sheerness. They are local men and
have been working in the port for two years.
The mood at 52 Second Avenue, the modest semi-detached home of Mr Les
Harris, was rather more sombre. He was holding a meeting with a few of his
friends who were among the workers made redundant by the company last
November, and who were required to sell back their shares for Pounds 2.50.
Mr Harris had 1,000 shares. Asked whether he was angry, he said: 'Of course
I am - angry and bitter.'

FT  23 SEP 93 / Clinton unveils healthcare for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night promised the US 'healthcare that can never
be taken away, healthcare that is always there' as he launched his campaign
for far-reaching reforms in the US medical system.
'This healthcare system of ours is badly broken and it is time to fix it,'
Mr Clinton said in an address to both houses of Congress. He said the
current health system was 'too uncertain and too expensive, too bureaucratic
and too wasteful. It has too much fraud and too much greed.'
Mr Clinton said his plan was based on six principles: security of coverage,
simplicity for patients and doctors, savings on costs, choice of doctor,
quality of care, and responsibility.
The core of Mr Clinton's plan is a national health card guaranteeing every
US citizen a defined package of health insurance benefits, similar to that
provided today by many big companies but with additional coverage of
preventive medicine.
Most people would be enrolled in 'health alliances' which would bring market
forces to bear to bring down costs.
All employers would be required to pay 80 per cent of the premiums for their
workers.
The plan envisages spending Dollars 160bn (Pounds 105bn) over seven years on
subsidies to smaller employers, as well as Dollars 80bn to expand coverage
of long term care and Dollars 72bn to pay for prescription drugs under the
Medicare programme for the elderly.
Mr Clinton hopes to save Dollars 285bn on existing government health
programmes and to raise Dollars 105bn from 'sin taxes', such as increased
tobacco tax.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Yeltsin confident as direct rule wins military support:
Foreign backing for president grows; Economic plan in pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin survived his first day of direct
presidential rule showing increasing confidence as a chorus of support from
the military, former Soviet neighbours and foreign states greeted his
decision to abolish the parliament and hold elections.
The parliament, after a blaze of defiance early yesterday morning, found its
parallel presidency lacking levers to pull, and its calls for strikes,
protest meetings and civil disobedience had no apparent effect.
Early yesterday it had voted to strip Mr Yeltsin of power and install his
conservative deputy, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, as president.
Mr Yeltsin also shrugged off the Constitutional Court's decision to
pronounce his decree unconstitutional.
He walked genially about central Moscow in the autum sun, promising that
'there will be no blood' as a result of his action. 'If the parliament does
not exist, there is not, there must not be, any dialogue with it.'
The international support for Mr Yeltsin strengthened as Nato and the
European Community joined the US, Japan and most of the European countries
in backing the Russian president.
Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, said on behalf of the EC that
member states supported Mr Yeltsin's move, even though it was
unconstitutional.
Mr Manfred Worner Nato secretary-general, insisted the alliance would
support democratic forces to prevent Russia from falling into chaos.
US president Bill Clinton, expressed his confidence that the situation would
remain calm and Mr Yeltsin retain control until elections in December.
In Germany, which had initially reacted with caution to the events, Mr Theo
Waigel, German finance minister, said Russian leaders must make it clear
that economic reforms would continue or lose international financial aid.
Senior officials of the Group of Seven and International Monetary Fund, said
Mr Yeltsin had appreciably improved his chances of receiving the assistance
which had been delayed as the reform process stalled.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, who has returned to the cabinet to head economic reform,
appeared before the press for the first time since assuming office and said
his three main tasks were to deal with inflation, to avoid populist policies
and further to liberalise the economy.
Mr Gaidar is preparing a raft of economic measures, which are likely to
include raising energy prices and further liberalisation of trade.
He may also consider cutting subsidies to the agricultural and defence
industries - constituencies which are unlikely ever to support radical
reform and which can be acted against with relative impunity.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, another first deputy prime minister, said that in the
weeks before the elections on December 11-12, a draft constitution would go
before the constitutional assembly and preparations for elections would be
made to the State Duma, the lower house of the proposed new Federal
Assembly, which would replace the Supreme Soviet.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, who confessed he had been 'a bit
frightened' by the prospect of life after Mr Yeltsin's decree, was in
confident mood late yesterday after a conference call with most of Russia's
regional and republican leaders. He said that Mr Yeltsin had the support of
nearly all of them.
General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister and Mr Viktor Yerin, the
security minister, threw their weight behind Mr Yeltsin. 'We are sure we are
fully in control of the situation,' said Mr Yerin.
The defence ministry issued a statement saying that Mr Yeltsin's finger was
the only one empowered to touch the nuclear button.
Nearly all of the leaders of the former Soviet republics - due in Moscow
tomorrow to sign a treaty of economic union - backed Mr Yeltsin, including
President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine.

FT  23 SEP 93 / Downey quits as head of investors' watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Gordon Downey, chairman of the Personal Investment Authority, resigned
abruptly yesterday from the proposed self-regulatory body following
regulators' criticism that he was unable to restrain industry interests on
the board.
He has been replaced by Mr Joe Palmer, a board member of the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and a former chairman of the
Association of British Insurers.
Industry officials said Sir Gordon's departure followed growing concern at
the SIB that the PIA board had been too willing to concede to powerful
interests in drafting its operating guidelines.
As a result, regulators feared that the authority's board had been plagued
by in-fighting, delaying the completion of its proposed rulebook.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chief executive, has said that creation of the
authority is central to his plans for enhancing investor protection. He has
also said the SIB will not approve the authority unless it draws up tougher
rules.
In a letter to Mr Large yesterday, Sir Gordon said he was resigning because
good progress had been made at the PIA and 'I do not see myself continuing
into the operational phase.' He also said he expected the authority's board
to be re-constructed.
Sir Gordon, a former senior Treasury civil servant, had been chairman of
Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers. From
the time he was appointed last year, he had been seen as too close to that
sector of the industry.
Also, board members said he had not faced down officials from the life
insurance industry who wished to influence the authority's rulebook. Mr
Palmer, 62, was group chief executive at life insurer Legal and General.
Mr Large said Mr Palmer had supported his efforts to improve protection for
retail investors, and had endorsed a letter to Sir Gordon last December in
which tough requirements for the PIA were spelled out.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sogefi earnings little changed
in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOGEFI, the Italian car parts group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's
Cir holding company, resisted the European motor industry downturn with a
only slight drop in consolidated first-half profits, to L19.4bn (Dollars
12.4m) before tax and extraordinary items against L19.6bn in 1992.
Group sales rose to L328.6bn from L319.4bn, while net indebtedness declined
to L104.2bn from L116.4bn at the end of June last year.
Separately, Sasib, another big Cir-controlled engineering group, reported a
fall in pre-tax first-half profits, to L21.9bn against L23.4bn last time.
Sasib said the tax figures masked an improvement in its trading position, as
the decline was mainly due to lower dividends and tax credits. Operating
profits recovered to L5.4bn from L600m last year. The group forecast that
full-year figures should represent an improvement on 1992.
Inflated by the lower value of the lira, turnover at the railway signalling,
tobacco equipment and food processing machinery maker jumped 17.5 per cent
to L379.2bn.
Gemina, the investment and financial services group tipped as one of the
most likely buyers of state assets in Italy's privatisation process,
yesterday admitted it had about L600bn in its war chest for possible
acquisitions.
Gemina, in which the Fiat industrial group is the dominant shareholder, has
been building up liquidity through a number of disposals or flotations.
The group reported a 23.4 per cent rise in consolidated net profits to
L193.7bn for the financial year to June 30. Although net earnings by the
parent company jumped to L125.3bn from L42.7bn, the dividend remains
unchanged at L60 for ordinary shares and L70 for savings stock.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fiat buys out Ford stake in New
Holland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT of Italy has taken over Ford's remaining 6.5 per cent stake in its New
Holland tractors and construction equipment business.
The US group sold its Ford New Holland tractor and industrial equipment
operations to Fiat in 1991, but retained a 20 per cent stake.
The holding was reduced to 13 per cent by an injection of new equity capital
by Fiat into the loss-making business, and Ford requested a further cut to
6.5 per cent in May this year.
Ford has now agreed to withdraw completely from New Holland, although Fiat
can still use the Ford oval trademark until May 1995 and the Ford name until
2001 on certain of its products.
Two Ford executives, Mr Allan Gilmour and Mr Peter Pestillo, have resigned
from the New Holland board.

THE POLISH government yesterday sold the Bydgoska Fabryka Kabli (BFK), a
leading cable producer, for Dollars 16.8m to a private consortium made up of
Elektrim, a trading company specialising in energy and telecommunications
equipment, and the Export Development Bank (BRE).
The deal is the largest involving a Polish private investor since the
privatisation programme started in 1990. The Polish consortium made the
purchase in the face of competition from three other bidders - including
Siemens of Germany, which is negotiating to buy the Elwro electronic works
in Wroclaw.
The successful bid was lower than Siemens' offer, of but the government
opted for domestic investors. Elektrim has purchased 60 per cent of the
equity in BFK, while BRE is taking a further 20 per cent and the remaining
20 per cent will be sold to BFK's 856 employees and management.
BFK reported a net profit of Dollars 1m on a turnover of Dollars 60.3m last
year.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Leaked letters a new obstacle to BAe-Taiwan aircraft deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and DENNIS ENGBARTH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN CAHILL, the chairman of British Aerospace, is expected to meet
Taiwanese government ministers today and discuss the latest obstacle to
progress on a joint venture to build regional jet aircraft.
Opposition politicians in Taiwan have leaked letters from Mr Cahill to Mr
Chiang Ping-kun, minister of economic affairs, in an attempt to show that
the deal is politically rather than commercially motivated.
Mr Cahill is due to meet both the vice-premier and Mr Chiang, whose ministry
is sponsoring Avro Aerospace International, the joint venture between BAe
and Taiwan Aerospace (TAC).
The leaked letters from Mr Cahill to Mr Chiang are dated August 13 and 16.
They threatened to abandon the joint venture if its funding problems were
not resolved. One suggested that the Taiwanese government should 'simply . .
. have instructed the (state-run) Chiao Tung Bank to provide (the) working
capital needed.'
Mr Cahill suggested in the letters that both TAC and the Chiao Tung Bank
were 'not proceeding in good faith' and threatened to call a press
conference to call the deal off.
The problem of financing the deal was resolved a fortnight later after
further negotiations in Taipei.
The venture is part of BAe's efforts to improve its profitability. The RJ
series of regional jet passenger aircraft, which would be built partly in
Taiwan, loses money for BAe. The venture would also provide a route for
Taiwan to enter the passenger aircraft industry.
Members of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive party have long been
critical of the project, saying that its risks had been understated and its
benefits to Taiwan industry exaggerated.
The renewed political opposition to the deal based on the leaked letters can
only have a limited effect on the progress of the joint venture.
The deal can go ahead without the explicit approval of lawmakers. But
opponents can delay it and at worst vote to force the cabinet to end its
support for the project or re-evaluate it.
This is only the latest in a series of hurdles raised by Taiwan banks
involved in financing the project. Although the financing structure was
agreed on August 27, subsequent talks in London on the transfer of
manufacturing and product development were not conclusive.
BAe says a final agreement will not be signed until the end of the year at
the earliest.

<TEXT>
AN Anglo-American energy consortium is on course to complete one of the
largest, single investments in eastern Germany after Mr Kurt Biedenkopf,
prime minister of Saxony, said he would grant it mining rights, writes Judy
Dempsey in Dresden.
The decision to grant the rights for Schleenhain, one of the brown coal
fields the consortium is buying, clears the way for an investment of more
than DM1.5bn (Dollars 920m) in eastern Germany. It also means eastern
Germany's highly regulated energy sector will be prised open.
The consortium - comprising PowerGen, the UK-based utilities company, NRG of
Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho - is buying a 44 per cent stake,
or the equivalent of 400MW capacity, in a power generating plant at
Schkopau, near Halle in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. It is also
buying the Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle, or Mibrag, lignite fields straddling
the states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.

FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie struggles to hold on to 3,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market, rescued towards the end of a confused trading session
by a rally in government bond prices, managed to hold on to the Footsie
3,000 level yesterday, but only just. In early trading, this important
benchmark was abandoned twice as equities reacted to the latest statistics
on the domestic economy, as well as to developments on the global front.
At the day's low the FT-SE 100 Index was 14.5 down at 2,990, but most of the
fall was recovered later. The closing reading put the index at 3,001.6 for a
decline on the day of only 2.9 points.
The relatively steady performance in the London stock market was the more
impressive since it contrasted with weakness on Wall Street, down 37 Dow
points overnight and a further 22 points off early in the new session when
London closed last night.
Sentiment was helped by the latest UK economic data for the second quarter.
Final figures for the gross domestic product were well received and the
trade deficit appeared a little better than expected.
Shares opened lower and were further depressed by trading news from Tesco,
the food retailer. However, market turnover was little better than on
Monday, when retail, or customer, business dipped below Pounds 1bn for the
first time for many weeks.
Any optimism following the cut in Japanese interest rates was quickly
scotched by a spokesman for the British government who, while returning from
Japan with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said that domestic interest
rates are 'at the right level'.
The stock market was met with Pounds 265m in rights issue calls, dominated
by a not unexpected call for Pounds 215m from Tarmac, Britain's biggest
housebuilder. The prospects for further rights issue calls continue to bear
down on a stock market still unhappy with the corporate results flow;
yesterday afternoon brought another profits warning, this time from Philip
Harris, supplier of scientific and industrial equipment.
Revision of official figures on second quarter annualised GDP growth from
1.5 per cent to 2 per cent gave the stock market significant encouragement
at midsession.
'The data was very positive for the corporate sector,' said Mr Ian Harnett
of Strauss Turnbull. There were reports that economists at several leading
market firms were considering firming up the year-end forecasts for the
Footsie, which were raised as the market raced ahead at the end of last
month.
However, for the immediate term the market remained confused, with traders
reluctant to see the Footsie fall below 3,000 but evidently not con-fident
enough to chase prices higher.
One factor was the unwillingness of the institutions to buy stock in spite
of the market's now substantial fall from the intraday trading peak on the
Footsie of 3,115, reached at the end of August.
Trading volume remained low yesterday, although at 538.4m shares the Seaq
total improved from Monday's lamentable figure of 442.9m. Non-Footsie
business returned to more normal average levels to provide about 52 per cent
of total business.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which extends beyond the Footsie to cover a wide
range of second line issues, climbed 5.4 to 3,429 yesterday.

FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The takeover battle in the US between QVC Network and Viacom for US
entertainment group Paramount turned the spotlight on Thorn EMI in the UK.
The shares advanced 9 to 988p, as Hoare Govett recommended the stock. The
broker believes the stock should be a beneficiary from a revaluation of
companies with lucrative copyright. Thorn is one of the world's largest
music publishers.
Dealers said it was the sentiment from the battle for Paramount that was
responsible for an advance in Rank Organisation of 9 to 791p.
The combination of a stock overhang and reports that UBS had advised
investors to 'take profits' depressed Reuters shares, which fell 30 to
1519p.
Business services company Hays Group improved 5 to 255p after reporting a 20
per cent jump in full-year profits.
Shares in scientific and industrial equipment supplier Philip Harris tumbled
50 to 154p after the company stunned the market with a profits warning. It
said profits this year were unlikely to match last year's levels, blaming
weakness in both international and UK markets.
Favourable comment that followed improved results at Morgan Crucible helped
the shares add another 3 at 326p.
Pharmaceutical stocks were out of favour ahead of today's announcement of
the US administration's health care reform proposals. Glaxo receded 12 to
630p on trade of 7.2m, while Zeneca eased 3 to 713p. However, two-way
business helped Wellcome reverse an earlier decline to finish 2 ahead on
balance at 712p.
Industrial chemicals group Yule Catto fell 18 to 259p after announcing a
one-for-six rights issue at 215p to raise Pounds 29.7m, in order to finance
its purchase of a 50 per cent stake in German company Synthomer Chemie and
reduce short-term borrowings. Yule's half-time profits slipped to Pounds
9.3m from Pounds 10.2m, although the company was upbeat about prospects for
the second half.
A statement on the transmission business of the Scottish electricity
companies from Offer, the electricity industry regulator, helped all UK
electricity stocks as the market welcomed both its reference to a 6 per cent
rate of return and its indication that the body will attempt to encourage
lower cost producers.
The statement was expected to be positive for Scottish stocks, but coming
ahead of Offer's planned review of the distribution business of all UK
electricity companies this spread the warm glow south as the market expects
the regulator to adopt consistent criteria.
Eastern Electricity, the second lowest cost operator, which has one of the
lowest rates of return, moved ahead 14 to 567p. East Midland Electricity
advanced 12 to 548p, while Midlands closed 10 higher at 587p, a rise matched
by Norweb, which finished at 605p. London Electricity appreciated 15 to
574p.
Racal Electronics relinquished 4 to 228p as selling against its sister
company Chubb hurt the stock.
The disappointing figures from Tesco hit sentiment in the rest of the food
retailing sector. J. Sainsbury, a strong performer on Monday following a
broker's recommendation, shed 7 to 449p. Wm Morrison Supermarkets, which
reports interim figures tomorrow, eased 3 to 124p, while Iceland ended 4
lighter at 212p.
In the drinks sector, nervous trading in Guinness ahead of tomorrow's
figures left the stock 6 cheaper at 460p. Bargain hunting, together with
vague bid talk, lifted Bass 6 to 479p.
Reports after the market close that Saudi Arabia had ordered around 200
Piranha light armoured vehicles were today expected to benefit GKN, which
builds the vehicles. In trading yesterday a stock shortage left the shares 5
firmer at 495p.
Banking stocks went for a frustrating series of random walks that left the
market struggling to explain the few features in a reasonably strong sector
which was buoyed by the overnight interest rate cut in Japan.
Schroders, the international merchant and investment banking group,
yesterday won the distinction of having the biggest fall on the FT-SE 100
Index it so recently joined, the shares closing 55 down at 1265p.
The stock is not very liquid and the fall came on top of negligible volume.
An analyst pointed out that new entrants to the Footsie often suffer a
falling share price as dealers sell on the event.
Royal Bank of Scotland moved ahead 7 to 311p on fairly aggressive buying.
The bank's financial year ends soon and the market is looking for the
clearer to turn out a good set of figures.
Analysts noted a marked differentiation between RBS, Abbey National (up 5 at
409p), National Westminster (6 ahead at 500p) and Lloyds, which slipped 5 to
552p. Abbey National, depressed by a weak outlook for building societies,
and NatWest have underperformed the sector in recent weeks, with yesterday's
adjustment seen as an element of catch-up.
The main feature in the oil group was BP, which bounced 6 to 301p on the
back of a buy recommendation from a US firm of stockbrokers. The sector was
lacklustre in spite of an overnight rise in the price of crude, with traders
apprehensive about next Saturday's Opec meeting.
The worries held back the price of shares in Monument Oil and Gas, the small
oil and gas company, which yesterday announced a third successful well in
its Argentinian discovery. The stock finished a half-penny firmer at 51 1/2
p.
A squeeze boosted Smiths Industries, finally 4 to the good at 372p.

FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tarmac rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Tarmac, Britain's largest housebuilder, was asking for Pounds 215m
by way of a rights issue came as no surprise whatever to sector analysts,
who had been predicting such action for several months. But some specialists
sounded unconvinced by the board's plans for the new cash injection,
commenting on the group's change of view on the prospects in the domestic
housing market.
The shares eased by a couple of pence to 145 1/2 p, with some traders
maintaining that the stock is overvalued by as much as 20 per cent.
Mr Robert Donald at NatWest Securities said that, on his own forecast that
earnings per share of 10p are likely in 1995, he would be prepared to pay
the 120p price for the rights issue, but not the current price in the stock
market.
However, the share price ticked up to around 151p in initial response to
news of the rights issue, which was understood to be easily underwritten. Mr
Mark Hake at Nikko Europe said the market may wait to see if Tarmac overpays
for the additions to its land bank for which the fund-raising is intended.
After considering the trading statement and rights issue proposals, analysts
at UBS are believed to have recommended the stock to clients.

FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco traded heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLUME in food retailer Tesco jumped to a hefty 13m shares, making it the
day's most actively traded stock, as analysts downgraded full-year profits
estimates after the company reported interim fig-ures just short of market
expectations.
Profits came in at Pounds 261.5m, against Pounds 252.8m previously, and the
dividend was increased by 9 per cent. However, market forecasts for profits
ranged from Pounds 265m to Pounds 270m. Having initially fallen 7 to 208p,
the shares steadied to end 4 off at 211p. Reseachers were particularly
disappointed by the decline in margins. There was also concern that the
company's refocused pricing proposition may lead to stiffer competition from
rivals; and there were suggestions that Tesco may have overvalued its
property portfolio.
Researchers reduced full year profits expectations, with UBS said to have
cut its estimate by Pounds 30m to Pounds 600m. Mr David Shriver at NatWest
Securities issued a more severe profits downgrade, reducing his year-end
estimate by Pounds 42m to Pounds 612m. He said: 'Tesco is now in a position
to articulate the way forward; the strategy is clearer but in the short term
the impact of investment in margins will not be beneficial to the bottom
line.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGHLY nervous session in derivatives yesterday mirrored the uncertainty
in underlying equities, reports Terry Byland.
Trading volumes were unimpressive, especially in stock index futures, and
prices tended to move erratically in response to activity in government
securities after when-issued trading started in the bonds scheduled for
auction.
The December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index fared a little better than the
underlying market, holding on to the 3,000 mark even at the day's low, which
came early in the session. A rally set in on the announcement of the
official data on domestic trade and GDP, and the contract advanced to 3,026,
a premium of about 4 on fair value of 24. Only 8,929 contracts were done,
however.
The final reading of 3,023 showed December effectively in line with fair
value. Traders said that several UK based securities houses had successfully
arbitraged against equities, buying the future and selling stocks.
Traded options recorded 23,186 contracts, against 19,509 previously, but the
FT-SE 100 option saw only 9,864, compared with 9,141 on Monday. The Euro
FT-SE option headed the actives list but with only 2,047 lots transacted.
Also busy was the Tarmac option, turning over 1,781 as the market took a
generally cautious view of the trading results and of the rights issue call
which accompanied them.

FT  22 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Concerns start to surface over Brazil's
equity rally - But foreigners stay buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sao Paulo stock market may not be the best barometer for measuring the
Brazilian economy given that equities have been accelerating even as
inflation climbs by more than 30 per cent a month.
Last Friday the Bovespa index put on a further 7 per cent in dollar terms
following an announcement by the government that it intended to deregulate
exchange rate policy.
This would mean that the three exchange rates currently in operation - the
commercial, tourist and parallel rates - would be reduced to just a single
US dollar exchange rate.
Having lost 2 per cent in dollar terms on Monday as investors took profits,
the Bovespa index ended a further 331 points off at 13,474 yesterday.
Nevertheless, there are clear reasons to explain why the market's
performance in dollar terms this year - a rise of more than 100 per cent -
is second only to Turkey among the 18 countries listed in the IFC's
investable price indices.
For all its economic and political uncertainty, Brazil remains Latin
America's most important economy.
'Brazil is not a small country; no matter who the president is, foreign
investors have got to be there,' says Mr George Rexing, director of foreign
banking services for Banco de Boston, the First National Bank of Boston's
subsidiary.
Long term foreign investors are adding exposure to Brazilian equities as
part of a global emerging markets strategy, he believes.
New portfolio investment totalled Dollars 1.4bn during the first six months
of this year, compared with Dollars 1.7bn for all of 1992. Foreign capital
market investment was hampered during the second half of 1992 due to the
corruption scandal leading to the impeachment of President Fernando Collor
de Mello.
Overall flow into capital markets might be slowed by a government decision
in August to restrict foreign access to fixed rate instruments; but the move
may help equities as foreigners shift funds into shares. Local bonds had
become increasingly popular as real interest rates pushed annualised yields
(in dollar terms) up to 16 to 17 per cent. As a result Salomon Brothers
identified important shifts in volume in many 'second tier' stocks
immediately after the change was announced.
Leading the market's gains have been state-owned electrical utilities,
propelled by real increases in tariffs and signals from the government that
privatisation of the sector is likely.
Shares in companies sold off by the government, especially in the steel
sector, have fared well under private ownership. Usiminas, the steel group
which was sold in October 1991, has, since then, climbed more than 150 per
cent in dollar terms.
Telebras, the state-owned holding company for the telecommunications sector,
remains the market leader, often responsible for more than half the market's
daily volume, while representing 60 per cent of the market index.
The shares appeared immune to recent difficulties, including the resignation
of the company's finance director, subsequent newspaper reports of alleged
corruption, and the resulting indefinite delay in planned international
capital market deals.
One reason for its continued strong performance is, according to a recent
Salomon Brothers report, hopes that the recent difficulties may boost the
likelihood of privatisation.
The report goes on to say: 'The current situation at Telebras also bodes
well for the major operating subsidiaries of the company, particularly
Telesp (which operates in Sao Paulo state) and Embratel (the long-distance
operator) which have longed to escape from the control of the holding
company.'
These factors have combined to push daily turnover on the Bovespa index to
unprecedented levels, consistently in excess of Dollars 200m a day this
month, against levels averaging Dollars 100m a day a year ago.
Most observers believe that Brazilian shares remain a bargain, but some warn
that the lustre may be coming off as the Bovespa index continues to climb,
outdistancing other markets in the region.
Although share bargains in good companies continue to be an attraction, a
recent report by First Boston concludes: 'In Brazil's stock markets,
politics have become far more important than fundamental company analysis.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Russian news leaves Dow
sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
REPORTS yesterday afternoon of political turmoil in Russia sparked heavy
selling of US equities, and left blue chip and cyclical stocks sharply lower
at the end of trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 38.56 weaker at 3,537.24, but well
above its low for the day of 3,507.07. Secondary indices fared better than
the Dow. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 2.10 at 452.95, while the American
SE composite shed 3.96 to 447.09 and the Nasdaq composite 6.65 to 733.56.
Trading volume on the New York SE was 300m shares.
Monday's big declines in stock and bond prices set the tone for a downbeat
opening to trading yesterday. Fresh losses in bonds, and concern about the
outlook for the economy and corporate earnings, further depressed the
market, which failed to respond to some rare good news from the housing
market - a bigger than expected 7.8 per cent rise in August housing starts
and a strong increase in building permits.
Prices fell even further during the afternoon as reports emerged from Russia
that President Yeltsin had unexpectedly dissolved parliament and called for
new elections. Amid rumours of a possible move by the military to oust Mr
Yeltsin, the Dow plummeted more than 70 points. Circuit breakers and late
buying, however, helped prices to rally strongly from their lows.
The big domestic story of the day was the emergence of the market's first
billion-dollar bid battle since the 1980s. Paramount Communications, which
only a week ago agreed to be bought by Viacom International, has attracted a
rival bid from QVC, the home-shopping network.
Late on Monday QVC made an offer for Paramount valued at Dollars 9.5bn,
compared to Viacom's original Dollars 8.2bn bid. Amid speculation that a
third contender might enter the fray - possibly Turner Broadcasting -
Paramount's stock jumped Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 77 in volume of 6.1m
shares.
The news left QVC, quoted on the Nasdaq market, Dollars 1/8 firmer at
Dollars 56 7/8 and Viacom, listed on the American Stock Exchange, down
Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 56 3/4. Turner Broadcasting receded Dollars 1/4 to
Dollars 25 3/8.
Among depressed cyclical stocks, Caterpillar fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 77,
International Paper gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 60 1/4, Aluminum
Company of America slipped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 and General
Electric declined Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 96 3/8.
Pharmaceuticals staged a recovery from Monday's losses. Merck gained Dollars
7/8 at Dollars 31 3/8, Pfizer Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 60 7/8, Johnson &amp;
Johnson Dollars 1 at Dollars 38 7/8 and Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars 1 3/8
at Dollars 58 3/4.
Tambrands dropped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 42 in heavy trading after the
board announced that it had decided not to sell the company, and that
instead it was embarking upon a restructuring of senior management.
Canada
TORONTO fell for the third consecutive day in heavy trading. The TSE 300
index ended 15.5 off at 3,937.3 and declines led rises by 515 to 237 after
volume of 73.9m shares.
Of the 14 sub-group indices, only the golds sector bucked the downward
trend, advancing 3.85 per cent as the New York spot bullion price surged
USDollars 9.20 an ounce.

FT  22 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Opposing influences on
Daimler, VW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFLICTING influences on the automotive and banking sectors, and Nordic
worries over currencies and interest rates gave bourses a lively day, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose again as professionals shook their heads over its source of
strength - a three-day gain of 9.1 per cent in Daimler, which put on another
DM20.70 to DM766.70.
The DAX index climbed over a 7.2 per cent rise in August M3 money supply to
close 13.01 higher at 1,925.85. Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.4bn but Mr
Jurgen Rossa, at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that there would have been
little volume to speak of over the past three days if Daimler, Deutsche Bank
and Siemens had been excluded.
With Daimler, due to make its New York stock exchange debut on October 5,
there was a suspicion of window-dressing ahead of the event. Later in the
day, the sector was troubled by a further fall in August new car
registrations; and Volkswagen, up DM2 to DM360.50 on the official session,
dropped DM3 to DM357.50 in the post-bourse as Standard &amp; Poors put VW debt
on its watch list.
In the broad market, the aggression behind the Daimler share price was not
matched elsewhere. Siemens was just DM1.60 higher at DM663 and Deutsche Bank
was flat at DM787.50 in a bank sector studiously neutral apart from Dresder,
up DM4.80 to DM418.80 with a press conference on yesterday's schedule.
However, the defensive qualities of utilities brought out analytical support
which left Veba and Viag up by DM6.30 to DM424.80, and by DM6 to DM448
respectively.
PARIS reacted calmly to results from Michelin which reported a first half
loss of some FFr3bn, mainly due to the inclusion of restructuring
provisions. The results were more or less in line with brokers' forecasts
and the shares slipped FFr2.40 to FFr174.90.
The CAC-40 index drifted down 12.97 to 2,094.39.
Mr Eric Michelis of Kleinwort Benson in Paris commented that Michelin was
likely to improve in 1994-1995 as the expected recovery in the car sector
came through, and he maintained a hold recommendation on the stock.
Elsewhere in the sector, Valeo, the components manufacturer, added FFr8 to
FFr1,064 and Peugeot rose FFr6 to FFr652.
Eridania Beghin-Say was quoted FFr2 higher at FFr798 by the close:
afterwards representatives of Ferruzzi Finanziaria and Montedison said that
restructuring plans at Ferruzzi did not include the sale its majority stake
in the French group.
ZURICH moved higher, bolstered by bank stocks, on the view that the
continuing strength of the Swiss franc, particularly against the D-Mark, had
increased the likelihood that interest rates will continue to edge lower.
The SMI index rose 13.4 to 2.431.8.
UBS rose SFr18 to SFr1,198 and CS Holding by SFr40 to SFr2,895. Insurers
were also sought with Zurich Insurance SFr23 ahead at SFr1,225.
Bearer shares in SMH, the watchmaker, rose SFr17 toSFr1,107 in active trade
following a presentation to analysts by the company.
AMSTERDAM retreated slightly while the budget details failed to excite
interest. The government said that it was abandoning its target for cutting
the budget deficit because of slower economic growth and rising
unemployment. It also forecast that GDP growth this year would be flat, but
should return to 1 per cent growth in 1994. Some analysts commented that the
announcement of greater infrastructure spending was in line with
expectations, but noted that the medium term economic outlook remained
depressed.
The CBS Tendency index closed 0.9 lower at 124.5.
Among the risers Unilever advanced Fl 1.30 to Fl 200.60, Elsevier 70 cents
to Fl 139.40 and KLM 40 cents to Fl 36.40.
KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, surprised analysts with its
announcement of a rights issue to lift its stake in Austrian paper group,
Leykam, to 90 per cent. The shares lost 90 cents to Fl 34.30, but off the
day's low of Fl 33.30.
STOCKHOLM extended Monday's losses on further weakness in the currency and
higher domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 16.7 or
1.3 per cent to 1,245.4. Turnover improved to SKr1.1bn from SKr827m.
Ericsson, the telecommunications stock, resisted the trend with a gain of
SKr2 to SKr410, helped by a rise in the US. Elsewhere, banks bore some of
the steepest declines on currency weakness, S-E Banken A falling SKr4 to
SKr42, and Svenska Handelsbanken A slipping SKr3 to SKr93.5.
OSLO shared Stockholm's currrency and interest rate problems, threw in
weaker prices for North Sea oil and came to a similar conclusion, the
all-share index falling 6.30 to 551.39.
MILAN moved ahead although trading remained thin as the Comit index rose
6.69 to 597.54. Unofficial data showing a small, unexpected decline in
inflation helped the mood.
Fiat added L150 to L6,004, while speculative demand took Olivetti L65 or 3.5
per cent higher to L1,925, ahead of results soon from both groups.

FT  22 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Cut in discount rate
prompts Nikkei upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES rose for the first time in five trading days on the wider than
expected cut in the official discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 200.62 at 20,466.65 on index-linked buying and
purchases by investors who held short positions. The index opened at the
day's low of 20,347.43, before rising to the day's high of 20,564.86 in the
afternoon session.
The Bank of Japan announced an official discount rate cut of 0.75 percentage
points to a record low of 1.75 per cent. While the news surprised some
investors, it did not lead to a rush of buy orders. 'People were weighing
the 1.75 per cent against the 0.8 per cent dividend yield of the Nikkei
average,' said a fund manager at Nippon Life, the country's largest life
assurer.
Volume was 351m shares, against 213m. Advances led declines by 707 to 301,
with 172 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put
on 10.90 at 1,649.80, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.65 to
1,262.96.
The stock market will be closed tomorrow for a national holiday.
Market participants commented that rather than place funds into equities,
institutional investors were committing money to the bond market. The yield
on the No 145 10-year benchmark government bond fell 10 basis points
yesterday to 3.86 per cent.
Interest rate-sensitive large-capital issues gained some ground. Nippon
Steel, the day's most active stock, put on Y1 at Y331, Sumitomo Metal
Industries rose Y6 to Y322 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y12 to
Y688.
High-technology issues were firmer, with Hitachi up Y10 to Y818, Fujitsu
rising Y10 to Y802 and Sony climbing Y70 to Y4,400. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone firmed Y7,000 to Y874,000, the first rise in six trading days.
Financials were also stronger. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank appreciated Y10 to
Y2,240 and Nomura Securities improved Y10 to Y2,050. But Industrial Bank of
Japan receded Y40 to Y3,360 on profit-taking.
Investors also took profits on retailers, with Daimaru falling Y24 to Y641
and Marui declining Y10 to Y1,720.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 153.16 to 22,536.65 in volume of 110.3m
shares.
Roundup
THE contrast between overnight losses on Wall Street and the gains in Tokyo
left the region with a number of active markets, in share price terms, but
no discernible trend.
HONG KONG gave the credit to high liquidity, via China funds set up
overseas, and to defensive stocks as the Hang Seng index moved forward
104.71, or 1.4 per cent, to 7,495.31. Turnover eased from HKDollars 3bn to
HKDollars 2.9bn.
Utilities led the advance, with HK Telecom adding 30 cents at HKDollars
12.80, Hongkong Electric 90 cents at HKDollars 21.30 and China Light 75
cents at HKDollars 43.
Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 53.50 but its parent, HSBC
Holdings, declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 79.50 - the strike price of
covered warrants on the bank issued by Peregrine late on Monday.
SINGAPORE's first day of extended trading hours left it with the Straits
Times Industrial index little changed in flat volume, 2.63 lower at 1,995.74
in turnover of 367.1m shares.
NEW ZEALAND ended soft as a 155m-share placing in Telecom at NZDollars 3.82
sucked funds from the market. Telecom ended 12 cents lower at NZDollars 3.99
as the NZSE-40 index fell 20.85 to 1,917.07. Turnover was NZDollars 620m,
with Telecom accounting for about NZDollars 599m of that.
TAIWAN saw another wave of profit-taking from gains established after the
central bank's credit easing last week. The weighted index moved narrowly
before late selling left it 23.43 lower at 3,904.38. Turnover fell from
TDollars 19.3bn to a modest TDollars 15.9bn.
MANILA, too, lost further ground as investors took profits after last week's
record highs, and positioned themselves for pending new issues. The Manila
composite index closed 28.26 down at 1,939.71 as combined volume rose from
1.46bn shares to 1.70bn.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark weakens on M3 data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR soared against the D-Mark last night in London following news
that president Boris Yeltsin had suspended the Russian parliament, writes
James Blitz.
For most of the day in London, the D-Mark had been confined to the DM1.6005
to DM1.6200 range that has been established against the dollar.
But the dissolution of the Russian congress and news that Vice-president
Alexander Rutskoi had named himself President pushed the dollar up sharply.
The US currency tends to perform well at times of international crisis,
while D-Mark investors have sometimes been concerned at times of crisis in
Russia by the level of German economic investment in the former Soviet
Union.
The dollar peaked at DM1.6425 after earlier closing in London at DM1.6195.
The US currency also performed strongly against the Japanese yen, peaking at
Y107.30. The dollar ended New York trading at DM1.6385 and Y106.33.
Earlier in the day, strong figures for August US home starts lifted the
dollar to its highs when New York opened. The 7.8 per cent jump was seen by
most analysts as a long-awaited correction to what has been a disappointing
sector of the economy.
The D-Mark also had a mixed performance against the dollar and European
currencies as dealers had different interpretations about the latest figure
for German monetary growth.
The August figure for M3 monetary growth has been the source of rumour and
counter-rumour in recent days, with wild estimates as to its level.
Some dealers found the annualised figure of 7.2 per cent rather lower than
expected, considering that this had been a period of intense Bundesbank
intervention in the European exchange rate mechanism, and took the view that
this figure could help the German central bank to cut rates.
That view seemed to hold sway in the trading of some cross rates. The D-Mark
closed weaker against the French franc at FFr3.487 from a previous FFr3.491.
However, the D-Mark was stronger against a number of other European
currencies. Sterling finished at DM2.4675 from a previous DM2.4700.
The larger than expected reduction in the Japanese discount rate applied no
downward pressure on the yen at the start of European trading.
But the yen fell back later in Europe as dealers took the view that the cut
would mean that the US would not take a confrontational stand against Japan
when the two sides meet in Washington later this week. Before the news from
Russia, the yen had closed at Y106.30 per dollar in London from a previous
Y104.25.
'The dollar/yen rate is a political animal above all,' said Mr Jeremy
Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America, 'and as long as the politics
between the US and Japan remain calm there is no reason why the dollar
should not go a lot higher.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / Money Markets: M3 number disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN dealers revised down their projections for interest rate cuts in
France and Germany yesterday after the latest figures for German M3 monetary
growth came in a little higher than had been expected, writes James Blitz.
In recent days, Bundesbank officials had led dealers to believe that the
figure for M3 monetary growth in August would not be as high as had been
anticipated. This was the month when the German central bank engaged in
heavy intervention to support ailing currencies in the European exchange
rate mechanism, and original estimates had been for an annualised figure
well above 8 per cent.
Far from calming the market, the Bundesbank's comments caused a flurry of
expectation late last week that the figure would turn out to be very low at
around 4.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent. So, when the final figure turned out to
be 7.2 per cent, after 7.4 per cent in July, there was some disappointment.
There was also disap-pointment after the Bundes-bank again announced a fixed
rate repo in this week's money market operations at 6.70 per cent. There had
been hopes for a return to the variable rate, although with call money still
well above the discount rate at 6.90 per cent, there might have been a
chance of bids coming in higher.
Euromark interest rate futures were down on all this news, with the December
contract falling 5 basis points to close at 93.92.
French franc interest rate futures fell much more heavily, with the December
contract dropping 14 basis points to finish at 93.64. At this level it is
pricing three-month money at the end of the year at 6.34 per cent, compared
to yesterday's cash rate of 7.25 per cent. There probably needs to be
official easing in France very soon if December is not to be sold off.
In the Japanese interest rate futures market, the 75 basis points cut in the
country's discount rate was greater than expected. The December contract
rose 14 basis points to end at 97.51. Three-month yen cash declined 1/8
percentage point to around 2 9/16 per cent.
The sterling market was comparatively quiet. Three-month money closed about
1/16 softer at 5 7/8 per cent. A shortage of Pounds 1.7bn was forecast at
the start of the day by the Bank of England, most of which was taken out in
the early round of trading.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC to cut 'inefficient' school
milk subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers yesterday decided to cut back from
next year an expensive subsidy on school milk for 31m schol children across
the community.
The controversy, which looked set to surround the decision has been offset
by limiting the cut to half what the European Commission had originally
planned, and by a belated attempt by Brussels to explain the bizarre
economics of the subsidy.
Last year, the EC paid out Ecu232m (Pounds 180m) on the subsidy, according
to figures from the commission, which originally proposed to cut outlays
back to Ecu109m by next year - a reduction that British and German officials
said would jeopardise the scheme.
Officials now say that yesterday's decision means the cut will be
significantly less, to Ecu176m.
Across the EC, 143,000 schools get the subsidy for 31m children; in the UK,
31,000 schools with some 8m children receive it, in France 10m, and in
Germany over 6m.
The subsidy was originally financed through the revenue from penalties
levied on milk producers for exceeding the production quotas fixed by the
EC. These levies were abolished in last year's reform of the common
agricultural policy, under which Ecu4.4bn was spent on the dairy sector in
1992.
But with the CAP budget now strained to its near Ecu36bn limit, the
commission and the EC are casting around for cuts, especially as bills mount
to buy off producer interests unhappy with the production, export and price
cuts required by the CAP reform and as part of the Uruguay Round trade
negotiations. But Commission officials said yesterday that the way the
subsidy is distributed was of little benefit to school children.
In Belgium, for instance, the subsidy is worth BFr16.3 (31p) a litre - or
125 per cent of the normal EC target price for milk - of which the farmer
gets BFr12. But the school child, the commission says, pays an average of
BFr34 a litre, higher than the average supermarket price of BFr30. This is
allegedly because of higher distribution and packaging costs; each litre,
for example, requires four quarter litre packages rather than one. 'The
profit is for the distributor and packager,' one commission official said,
adding that 'it is up to the industry to take responsibility for that sort
of thing, not us.'
'It is the most expensive and inefficient system we have for encouraging the
consumption of milk,' he said, a view endorsed by member state agriculture
officials in Brussels.
This is a high ranking in comparison with other milk schemes the EC runs,
which are also likely to come into the spotlight as a result of the school
milk controversy. The 'calf milk replacement' scheme - whereby milk from the
cow's udder enters the calf's mouth only after first having been turned into
powder, then protein enriched, and then turned back into milk - costs about
Ecu1.5bn a year, according to one official.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago lumber futures hit
peaks after big rise in US housing starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO LUMBER futures prices, which have earned a reputation for volatility
this year, rallied sharply early yesterday in response to news that US
housing starts had advanced in August at their fastest rate in a year. A US
Commerce Department report said the seasonally adjusted rate would indicate
1.323m homes being built in the US this year.
However, profit-taking by traders who had bought futures during strong
advances on Friday and Monday halted the rise, and by midsession lumber
futures for November delivery, which had reached a recent high of Dollars
336 per 1,000 board/feet, had turned lower.
Nearby prices had rallied their 10 cents-a-contract daily limit on Friday
and Monday after the US Commerce Department surprised traders by
recommending that a US duty on Canadian lumber imports be raised to 11.54
per cent from the existing 6.51 per cent. The higher duty, which must still
be reviewed by a US-Canadian trade committee, would not be effective until
December 16.
With US timber cutting in Pacific north-west forests restricted by
environmental red tape, an increasing amount of US building materials are
being imported from Canada.
The duty decision led several Canadian lumber mills to reconsider selling
into the US futures market, for fear of incurring duties during delivery,
lumber analysts said.
'The rally was really the result of a lack of sellers. The Canadian mills
that would generally sell into a rally hung back,' commented Mr Curt
Cunningham, analyst for Seattle-based Pacific Futures Trading.
The 7.8 per cent jump in August starts might not be sustainable, despite
historically low mortgage rates, traders said. Much of the increase in
August building was delayed activity following unusually wet summer weather.
'Builders who couldn't dig foundations because of the wet are rushing to get
houses framed before the cold weather,' Mr Cunningham said.
Still, applications for permits to build new homes also rose sharply in
August, by 7.5 per cent to an annualised rate of 1.249m units.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME's 'despicable' copper
intervention criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange board was strongly criticised yesterday for
allowing an hour to go by between the end of a meeting at which directors
decided to intervene to stop the 'squeeze' in the exchange's copper market
and the announcement of that decision. During that hour the copper price
fell 'precipitously,' said Mr John Champagne, a vice-president of Magma
Copper, the third-largest US copper producer.
In an outspoken condemnation of the LME's actions, he also suggested it was
'despicable' for the board to favour by its decision those who were short of
copper (those who had sold metal they did not own in the expectation of
buying it later at a lower price) because most of the LME board members were
'short'.
Answering questions at a Magma presentation to the Association of Mining
Analysts in London, Mr Champagne said the LME board had sent out a signal
that would encourage those going short of metal to believe that in future
their losses on the exchange would be limited.
Before he joined Magma in 1988, Mr Champagne was president of Cargill Metals
and responsible for the non-ferrous metal trading activities of Cargill,
probably the world's biggest commodities trader. From 1978 to 1981 he was
based in London and was a member of the LME.
Any intervention at all in the market by the LME board was 'regretable', he
said yesterday. 'Markets are to be left alone.' He added: 'In the long run
if, the LME continues to do things like this it will pay a heavy price.'
The LME board took emergency action on September 8 in response to widespread
suggestions that its 'flagship' copper market, on which most purchase
contracts around the world are based, was being manipulated to boost the
price. It limited the daily backwardation (premium over the future price for
metal for immediate delivery) to limited to Dollars 5 a tonne saying this
was 'in anticipation of the development of an undesirable situation in the
copper market'.
This intervention eventually resulted in the technical tightness
disappearing and the three-month copper price has fallen by nearly 10 per
cent, from Dollars 1,947 a tonne to Dollars 1,749.50 and close to the lowest
levels for nearly six years.
Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, said last night he would not
comment on Mr Champagne's remarks until he had full details and, as there
was no written text, this might take some time. Mr Champagne said he
intended to outline his complaints in a letter to Mr King.
Mr Burgess Winter, president, said the joint venture company Magma had set
up with BHP of Australia had last Friday bid for the El Abra copper project
in Northern Chile put up for sale by Codelco, the state-owned group. He said
the fiercest competition from among several other bidders was likely to come
from RTZ Corporation of the UK or a joint venture between Cyprus Minerals of
the US and Lac Minerals of Canada.
Magma's bid, if it was revealed because it was successful, would be judged
by some observers to be high, Mr Winter said. However, there would be a good
return on the investment and it would pay for itself very quickly.
Codelco studies indicate that the project could produce 265m lb of copper a
year using low-cost oxide leaching, solvent extraction-electrowinning
methods.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commodity prices 'to fall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COMMODITY prices are likely to fall by 3 per cent in 1993-4, a
reflection of the continuing low economic growth in major industrial
nations, according to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource
Economics.
The predicted fall would follow an 8 per cent decline in 1992-3. 'The slide
in commodity prices has resulted from continued sluggish economic activity
in the major OECD economies, generally good seasons for world agriculture,
and for metals a failure by producers to cut supplies sufficiently to reduce
stock,' Abare said yesterday.
More cheerfully, the research organisation predicted that a modest upturn in
major western economies by 1994-95, should increase demand for commodities
and help prices to rise. But it warned that 'the recovery in these prices
may be gradual and patchy'.
In the wool market, Abare noted that demand had been weak in the current
selling season and that demand from China could become volatile given the
general overheating in the domestic economy.
On the grains front it suggested that a record Chinese wheat crop and large
Russian and US crops had boosted estimates of world wheat production in
1993-4 to 569m tonnes, 10m tonnes more than in 1992-93, and reduced the
forecast world wheat price in 1993-4 to USDollars 135 per tonne, USDollars 5
per tonne less than in 1992-93.
ABARE noted that oil and gold prices were forecast to rise slightly in
1993-94, but it also pointed to the falling trend in Australian contract
prices for iron ore and coal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUFFER stock manager of the International Natural Rubber Organisation
says he will be asking organisation members for more cash to buy in rubber
in an effort to prop up sagging prices. Up to Dollars 60m could be requested
from Inro's 20 natural rubber consuming and six producing countries.
The Inro buffer stock manager has now accumulated a stockpile of about
200,000 tones of natural rubber. Rubber traders say Inro member countries
might be reluctant to contribute more funds in view of uncertainties about
the future of the organisation.
Producer and consumer countries have been involved in protracted arguments
about renegotiating the International Natural Rubber Agreement, which Inro
supervises. Consumer countries, led by the European Community, want the
present agreement, which expires at the end of this year, to be renewed, but
producers want a renegotiation of the terms of the agreement.
Mr Ahmad Farouk, head of Malaysia's delegation dealing with Inra, says
producers cannot survive persistently low prices and will have to take
action if consumers fail to agree to a new Inra.
'I can tell you for certain, if there are no negotiations, there is no Inra'
said Mr Farouk. 'I just can't understand the consumers. To negotiate doesn't
mean to agree. The producers have bent over backwards in the spirit of
co-operation.'

<TEXT>
THE PAKISTANI government said last night that the country's locust emergency
was over.
Mr Salman Farooqi, the secretary general of the agriculture ministry in
Islamabad declared: 'The whole thing has been contained in the desert,'
adding that up to 400 swarms which had entered Pakistan had been wiped out
in an army-backed spraying operation.
He said, however, that the country would continue to monitor an area of some
50,000 sq km in the deserts of Thar (Sindh) and Cholistan (Punjab), in
preparation for any other swarmlets entering from the Indian state of
Rajasthan.
An international appeal for assistance of up to USDollars 1.3m towards the
anti-locust operations, has so far received yielded Dollars 850,000 000 and
another Dollars 600,000 is expected in the near future, senior officials
say.
Meanwhile, Mr Zahoor Ahmed, head of Pakistan's leading cotton research
station in the city of Multan, said that at least 11.5m bales of cotton were
expected from the crop this year, which is due to be harvested, next month.
That would be close to the government's target of 12m bales.
The locust attack had raised concerns over the future of Pakistan's cotton
output which is considered to be crucial for the country's economy.
Some officials argue that this year's alarming situation should encourage
the government to intensify vigilance and store large supplies of pesticides
to deal with any new threats. 'This year, we were lucky, next time we may
not be,' said one official.

London coffee and cocoa futures were weaker in the afternoon as both bowed
to pressure from New York, but traders remained confident that the overall
trend remained upward. The December delivery COCOA price temporarily dipped
below Pounds 900 a tonne, but held above support at Pounds 890/895 and ended
the day Pounds 13 down at Pounds 904 a tonne. Traders said the corrective
move was to be expected, with investment funds and speculators looking for
an opportunity to take profits. November delivery robusta COFFEE sank to
Dollars 1,255 a tonne at one point as it followed the New York trend. But
follow-through selling failed to materialise and most of the fall was
recovered. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices remained weak in
the afternoon, having slumped on liquidation at midday, and some analysts
were projecting a fall to the Dollars 1,100-Dollars 1,105-a-tonne area for
three months metal. Final business was at Dollars 1,119 a tonne, down
Dollars 10.50 from Monday. The NICKEL market initially extended recent
declines, crashing to a 6 3/4 -year low of Dollars 4,200 for three months
delivery before support developed around Dollars 4,210 a tonne.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC approves Argentine fisheries
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community has approved a new three-year fishing agreement with
Argentina which grants EC vessels access to Argentina's rich fishing grounds
for the first time, while giving Argentine fish exports preferential access
to EC markets.
The community's ships will be able to operate in Argentine waters, which
were previously restricted to local ships, in association with Argentine
companies. European import tariffs will be reduced to 5-10 per cent for
Argentine supplies. Furthermore, the EC will provide the Argentine industry
with USDollars 33m in cash grants for the industry. The agreement covers
exports of 250,000 tonnes of hake, cod and Illex squid.
The new agreement is considered an advance on similar accords signed between
Brussels and third countries because it increases the involvement of local
companies. Owners of EC vessels must form joint ventures with Argentine
companies. This is intended to modernise the Argentine fishing fleet, by
allowing local companies to replace their ageing ships with more modern
European ones. Catches are not intended to increase, because EC ships must
be either equal in capacity or smaller than the Argentine ships they are
replacing.
However, the local industry fears that the newer European ships will
increase fishing pressure on hake - already close to maximum levels.
Overfishing would not only threaten stocks but erode prices and thus offset
the benefit of lower tariffs. Last year Argentina's fish catch rose 10 per
cent to a record 692,000 tonnes.
The industry suspects that the agreement will benefit the Spain - which has
a large number of idle fishing ships - more than Argentina. Mr Mario
Olaciregui, president of Harengus, Argentina's largest fishing company,
said: 'There is more optimism about the accord in Vigo than there is here'.
However, he recognised that the agreement will modernise Argentina's fishing
fleet and provide funds for scientific research.
The government also says that the agreement advances its claims to the
Falkland Islands. Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, the agreement will
'make (the islanders) realise that we have very important friends'. However,
the EC excluded the Falklands' 150-mile fishing zone from the agreement and
established a 30,000-tonne limit for catches of the Illex squid - the
Falklands' most lucrative species.
Last December, Argentina began selling low-priced fish licences aimed in
part at undercutting those sold by the Falklands, thus reducing a key source
of revenue for the islands.
Britain and Argentina are to hold new fishery talks in Buenos Aires in
December.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Russian upheaval may trigger selling in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS of political upheaval in Russia came as Europe's bond markets were
closing and had little impact on cash prices. However, it pressured futures
prices in after-hours trading and could spark further selling today.
Moreover, the dollar surged against most European currencies, reasserting
its safe-haven status. 'This (the Russian crisis) may cause a little
nervousness by US and Japanese investors who have been the big players in
Europe,' said Mr Mark Capleton, international bond strategist with Barclays
de Zoete Wedd. 'But it's unlikely to be material,' he added.
GERMAN bonds ended about 1/8 point lower, with the news from Russia erasing
the bund future's late gains.
The December contract closed at 98.82, down by 0.15 of a point from Monday.
Although Germany's latest monetary data showed much weaker-than-expected
money supply growth, the release had little impact on prices. German M3 grew
at 7.2 per cent through August, whereas economists' forecasts centred on a
growth rate of around 7.9 per cent.
However, after encouraging remarks last week from Bundesbank president Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the market had discounted a lower figure and largely
ignored the numbers.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank set fixed-rate repos at 7.60 per cent, the same
rate as last week, for today's allocation. This disappointed some dealers
who had hoped for a return to variable-rate repos.
DUTCH bonds were given a small lift by the government's announcement that it
has completed its funding programme for this year, though they ended lower
on the day in line with bunds. The yield gap between the German 10-year
benchmark and its lower-yielding Dutch counterpart widened to 17 basis
points from 14 on Monday.
FRENCH bond futures' earlier gains were wiped out in the late sell-off,
leaving them to close about 1/4 point lower on the day. Fading hopes of a
rate cut at Thursday's repo operation by the Bank of France also dampened
prices.
IN LONDON, gilts ended little changed as traders digested the Bank of
England's announcement for plans to auction Pounds 3 1/4 bn of 6 3/4 per
cent gilts due 2004 next Wednesday. 'The amount was a bit larger than
expected and the coupon a bit lower,' said a trader.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied to a six-year high after the Bank of Japan
delivered a larger-than-expected 3/4 -point reduction in its official
discount rate, to 1.75 per cent. Although this is seen as the last cut in
the current cycle, prices are expected to remain supported by buying from
Japanese funds, said one dealer.
AFTER initially staging a solid recovery from Monday's losses, longer-dated
US Treasury prices fell yesterday as investors rushed into shorter-dated
securities amid growing concern about the political unrest in Russia.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 7/16 at 101
19/32, yielding 6.128 per cent. In contrast, at the short end of the market
the two-year note was up 3/32 at 100, to yield 3.857 per cent.
Prices slipped at the opening in response to news of a bigger-than-expected
7.8 per cent rise in August housing starts. The figures on building permits
were also above expectations. The early declines, however, did not last
long, as retail buyers entered the market, attracted by the low prices. By
late morning Treasuries were back in positive territory across the entire
yield curve.
Trading picked up pace during the afternoon, however, when the first news
emerged of political turmoil in Russia. Amid rumours that the military was
intervening to oust President Boris Yeltsin, investors sought out the short
end of the market as a safe haven, while selling longer-dated Treasuries.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Hectic flow dominated by Japanese
borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of financings by Japanese borrowers was the main feature of
yesterday's hectic flow of deals.
Tuesday's  3/4 -point rate cut in Japan helped improve rates for Japanese
borrowers hoping to swap the proceeds of their deals back into yen. But
yesterday's two Japanese government-guaranteed bond offerings were planned
prior to the rate cut, dealers said. Japan Development Bank and Japan
Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises both tapped the international
bond market.
Japan Development Bank's Pounds 200m issue via S. G Warburg and J. P. Morgan
provided much needed supply at the seven-year area of the yield curve, where
there is little current coupon paper.
The strong rally in recent months means that most sterling bonds are trading
at a substantial premium to their par value, which makes them illiquid.
The deal was priced to yield 17 basis points above the seven-year gilt,
which appears relatively aggressive compared with outstanding seven-year
paper, but proved attractive given the lack of paper trading around par
value. In fact, some dealers said the issue could have been priced more
aggressively, by several basis points.
'The deal went very smoothly: it could have been twice the size,' said one
trader.
According to S. G. Warburg, the bonds were placed mainly in Europe, rather
than east Asia. Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises' smaller
DM150m deal, which was also priced to yield 17 basis points over the
comparable government benchmark, attracted mainly German domestic interest.
In the French bond market, Alcatel launched a rare FFr2bn corporate bond
issue in a sector which does not always favour names from outside the state
sector.
However, in this case, the second best-rated private sector French company
provided a welcome change from government-backed names, and some extra
margin, at a yield spread 40 basis points over the comparable French
government bond.
Volkswagen, the German car company, has been placed on Creditwatch with
negative implications by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. VW has
Dollars 577m of AA minus-rated long-term debt.
Standard &amp; Poor's said that Volkswagen's financial performance has improved
more slowly than anticipated as a result of difficult conditions in the
European car market, an uncompetitive cost structure and problems at the
Seat subsidiary.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian bank seeks to raise
Dollars 820m from public issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY

<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STATE Bank of India, India's largest commercial bank, will launch later this
year equity and bond issues worth a total of Rs24.72bn (Dollars 820m).
It will be the first time in 40 years that an Indian commercial bank has
made a public issue of securities. The capital injection will enable the
bank to meet the Basle agreement on bank capital adequacy requirements.
SBI's capital ratios are currently around 5 per cent. The Basle norm is 8
per cent.
The move is being widely interpreted in India as a sign of the government's
determination to press ahead with the sale of shares in the bank.
Once the issues are launched, the government's stake in SBI will fall to
about 74 per cent from 95 per cent at present.
The equity element of the public offer is 12.4m shares at a premium of Rs800
to raise Rs11.16bn. The bond issue will centre on 10-year floating rate
bonds, with interest at 2.5 per cent above the maximum term deposit rate,
which is 10 per cent at present.
Analysts predict that the SBI flotations will be a runaway success, partly
because of their rarity value.
The Rs800 premium is considered modest by analysts. It compares with the
Rs4,400 at which the shares currently change hands on the Bombay Stock
Exchange, and with a peak last year of Rs7,250.
Indian bourses are passing through a difficult phase; share prices are far
below peak levels of 18 months ago.
SBI has Rs14.62bn capital and reserves. The capital injection will lift
owned funds to nearly Rs40bn. The bank made a net profit of Rs2.12bn for the
year ended March.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale, the French banking group, has launched an issue of
warrants on Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index, the result of co-operation
between Societe Generale Equities &amp; Derivatives and Crosby Securities, the
Hong Kong-based stockbroking group in which the Societe Generale group has a
49 per cent stake.
The warrants are American-style, which means that they can be exercised at
any time during their life. There are two tranches, expiring in 13 months
and 19 months, both denominated in US dollars.
They include both put and call warrants, but Societe Generale is bullish on
the market and therefore recommends call warrants.
Crosby analysts are forecasting a rise of 27 per cent in the Hong Kong stock
market in the next 12 months, second only to Malaysia in the region.

HYDRO-QUEBEC'S hectic financing activity should ease in 1994 as the interest
rate curve flattens, said Mr Daniel Leclair, vice-president financing and
treasurer.
Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest power utilities, estimates its
1993 financing operations in domestic and global markets at about CDollars
4.9bn, including CDollars 2.4bn for borrowing needs and CDollars 2.5bn of
refinancing and redemptions to take advantage of declining rates.
In 1994, it expects total financing of between CDollars 4bn and CDollars
4.5bn, including CDollars 3bn for fresh needs. It has reduced its average
interest cost from 11 per cent in 1988 to 9.4 per cent in 1993, and expects
a further reduction next year. The 1994 programme will again be mainly in
Canadian dollar and Euro-Canadian markets, and US dollars.

surprise resignation

<TEXT>
MR Nigel Rich has resigned as managing director of Jardine Matheson. He will
be replaced by Mr Alasdair Morrison, currently managing director of HongKong
Land Group, Jardine's property investment arm.
Mr Rich had been 'taipan' of Jardine since 1989, taking the helm during a
period predominated by politics, as the Jardine group made its attempt to
side-step Hong Kong stock market regulations and gain a primary listing in
London.
He also led the group's expansion overseas, with HongKong Land taking a 25
per cent stake in Trafalgar House, the UK construction and property group.
Other notable group deals included Jardine Strategic Holdings' purchase of a
substantial investment in Singapore-listed Cycle and Carriage and a sizeable
investment in retail operations in New Zealand, Spain and Singapore by the
group's Dairy Farm arm.
The announcement of his departure, which will take place in March 1994, came
as a surprise. However, Mr Rich said he had only wanted to take on the job
for five years. 'I had always had it in mind that my successor should have a
good run in before 1997,' he said.
He will return to London in 1994, where there is speculation that he may be
offered a role in Trafalgar House.
Mr Morrison has been with the group for 22 years, and had long been seen as
the eventual successor to Mr Rich, who had also risen through the ranks of
Hongkong Land.
The reshuffle is not expected to lead to any changes in Jardine's management
strategy, which is strongly influenced by its largest single shareholder,
the Keswick family.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Merger talk lifts US bank's
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of the largest regional banking merger yet seen in the US led
to a surge in the share price of Fleet Financial, New England's biggest
banking group, yesterday.
Coming a day after the announcement of a near-Dollars 1bn merger of the
second and third largest banks in Wisconsin, Marshall &amp; Ilsley and Valley
Bancorp, the suggestion of a bid for Fleet added strength to claims that US
regional banking groups are entering a period of accelerated consolidation.
The jump in Fleet's share price was prompted by a report that NationsBank,
the North Carolina-based institution which has grown by acquisition to
become the US's fifth largest bank in terms of assets, was preparing a bid.
Mr Thomas Hanley, a highly-regarded banking analyst at CS First Boston, said
he understood NationsBank was preparing a bid at a premium of between 15 per
cent and 20 per cent above the current Fleet share price. Both banks refused
to comment yesterday.
Any NationsBank approach to Fleet would potentially run foul of the
Southeast Compact, an mid-1980s agreement which permits interstate banking
in 13 states in the South Eastern part of the country but limits the ability
of banks based in the region to expand elsewhere. The compact requires banks
in the region, such as NationsBank, to maintain 80 per cent of their assets
in the area.
Fleet had assets of Dollars 47bn at the end of last year, making it the US's
14th largest banking group, compared with NationsBank's Dollars 118bn. Its
strong position in the North Eastern part of the country makes it one of the
most attractive acquisition targets for banks looking to develop national
networks.
Fleet's shares were up Dollars 2 at one stage, at Dollars 34 1/2, before
falling back to close at Dollars 33 7/8.

MR RICHARD Markham, who resigned in July as president and chief operating
officer of Merck, the US's biggest pharmaceuticals company, is to take up a
similar position at rival Marion Merrell Dow.
His appointment will also lead to a reshuffle among the senior management at
Marion, following similar shake-ups at other leading drugs companies in
recent months.
Mr Markham, 42, was considered a strong contender for the top job at Merck
before his departure, which was said at the time to be for personal reasons.
Merck hinted at the time that he would not be joining a rival drugs group.
To make way for Mr Markham, Mr Fred Lyons, 57, president and chief
executive, will give up the president's job and become chairman. Mr Joseph
Temple, 64, will step down as chairman but remain a board member. Mr David
Sharrock, 57, chief operating officer, will retire but also remain on the
board.

JARDINE Matheson Holdings, the diversified Hong Kong trading and investment
company, yesterday reported improved first-half profits and announced a
sharp rise in the interim dividend.
Net profit for the first half of 1993 rose by 14 per cent to USDollars
173.8m, up from USDollars 151.8m a year earlier. The interim dividend is
going up to 6.8 cents a share from 3.7 cents.
Turnover - up 6 per cent at USDollars 4.04bn - grew more slowly, reflecting
adverse conditions for the trading and distribution business in Japan, and
slower car sales in Hong Kong.
The wholly-owned Jardine Pacific unit, which includes engineering, car
sales, and restaurant businesses, recorded 9 per cent growth to USDollars
80.3m, in spite of a halving of profits from its trading and distribution
business.
Jardine Fleming, the joint-venture securities house owned with Robert
Fleming, announced strong figures due to buoyant Asian stock markets.
Profits jumped 81 per cent to USDollars 77.1m, and the company's fund
management business reported a 33 per cent increase in funds under
management to USDollars 13.3bn.
Of the group's other listed operations, Dairy Farm and Hong Kong Land both
reported steady earnings growth, while Mandarin Oriental's profits were
flat.
Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, warned of the continuing effects of the economic
slow-down in Japan. He added that China's austerity measures would have an
adverse impact on business in the current six months.
However, he stressed that the group continued to benefit from strong
financial markets in the Asia-Pacific region.
'Our diversified businesses and financial strength should enable us to
achieve satisfactory earnings growth for the full year', Mr Keswick said.

KAWASAKI Heavy Industries of Japan is bidding for Philippine Shipyard and
Engineering under a programme aimed at auctioning 87 per cent of state
shareholdings in the 52-hectare shipyard, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Kawasaki, in conjunction with a Philippines group, will bid for the shipyard
at a tender to be held early next month.
The Japanese company owned 40 per cent - with a Philippine state investment
group holding the rest - when the shipyard began life in 1976. It reduced
its stake to 4 per cent in 1988 after the shipyard fell into financial
difficulty.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sagasco rejects ADollars 760m
Boral offer

<TEXT>
SAGASCO, the owner of South Australia's suburban gas network and various
production assets, yesterday said that the ADollars 760m (USDollars 495m)
bid from Boral, the building materials group, was 'not fair and reasonable'.
In support of its bid defence, the company released a valuation by Grant
Samuel, the merchant bank, which suggested that Sagasco was worth between
ADollars 3.02 and ADollars 4.29 a share, in contrast to the ADollars 3.50
which Boral is proposing to pay.
Boral said later that it had not considered raising its offer and still
believed that the offer was fair.
The South Australian state government retains a 32 per cent interest in
Sagasco, having sold a 19.9 per cent stake to Boral at ADollars 3.40 a
share. It said yesterday that no decision had been taken over its holding,
but that it would seek to maximise its return.
'We will go for the best possible price that somebody will actually pay,'
commented the authorities.
TNT, the troubled transportation group, yesterday insisted that its plans
for some form of capital-raising exercise had not yet been finalised.
The stock market has been awash with rumours of a ADollars 300m preference
share issue, and the expectation that an issue was being finalised sent TNT
shares up by four cents to ADollars 1.36 yesterday.
The issue is being lead managed by County NatWest and Macquaries Equities,
and is expected to be presented to the TNT board later this week.
The R&amp;I Bank of Western Australia plans to change its name to Bank of
Western Australia and to reduce its staff by 12 per cent, or 400 people,
Reuter reports.
The bank is owned by the Western Australian state government. Mr Warwick
Kent, managing director, said the jobs would go as a result of an operations
review, although no branches were expected to close.

FOUR leading New Zealand businessmen - Sir Michael Fay, Mr David Richwhite,
Mr Alan Gibbs and Mr Trevor Farmer - yesterday sold 155m shares in Telecom
Corporation for NZDollars 592m (USDollars 213.4m).
They had been granted options to buy a 10 per cent stake in the company by
Bell Atlantic and Ameritech when the two US telephone companies acquired
Telecom in 1989 for NZDollars 4.25bn.
Yesterday the four men, acting through their private investment companies,
exercised the options, paying the US companies NZDollars 1.82 a share. The
shares were immediately sold for NZDollars 3.82.
Sir Michael and Mr Richwhite's private company, Midavia Holdings, sold 87.5m
shares. Freightways' subsidiary, Rontas, controlled by Mr Gibbs and Mr
Farmer, sold 67.5m shares.
This reduced Bell Atlantic and Ameritech's shareholdings to under 49.9 per
cent, the level they had agreed when they bought the company from the the
New Zealand government.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Public ambitions of Bimantara -
Indonesian group is poised for more flotations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIMANTARA Group, one of a small number of fast growing conglomerates which
dominate Indonesia's private sector, may be about to float further
subsidiaries on the Jakarta stock market.
The company has expanded rapidly since its formation in 1982. It has almost
70 subsidiaries in sectors as diverse as chemicals, tourism, financial
services and animal feed, and has built up assets of more than Dollars
1.75bn.
But Bimantara has a reputation for secrecy as well as for rapid growth.
Analysts say the group's expansion has relied in part on the political
connections of its founders, led by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, President
Suharto's second son, who owns 39 per cent of Bimantara Citra, the group's
holding company.
The group has been adroit at winning government contracts, often without
open tender, and has been adopted as a local partner by many foreign
companies undertaking large projects in Indonesia. Other shareholders
include Mr Indra Rukmana (Mr Trihatmodjo's brother-in-law) who has a 39 per
cent stake.
Important projects currently under way include a Dollars 100m toxic waste
processing plant in partnership with Waste Management International of the
US; a Dollars 350m proposal to own the country's next generation of
communication satellites; a joint venture with Indonesia's Barito Pacific
Group for a Dollars 1.6bn petrochemicals plant in West Java; and a proposal
with Siemens of Germany to build, own and operate a Dollars 2bn power
station in East Java.
Some analysts say that the company collects businesses in an ad hoc manner,
has a weak management structure and depends too heavily on debt financing
provided by state banks.
Profits, however, have risen rapidly, with net earnings moving up from
Rp98bn (Dollars 45m) in 1990 to an estimated Rp200bn for 1992.
Three subsidiaries account for 50 per cent of its earnings. They are Food
Specialities, a dairy products joint-venture with Nestle; International
Timber Corporation, a forestry and wood products company; and Japfa Comfeed,
Indonesia's second largest animal feed producer, in which Bimantara has a 20
per cent stake.
Mr Ahmad Afdhal, Bimantara's corporate secretary, says that 'in the next few
years our chemical and property companies will make a lot of profits'.
Oil company executives, however, estimate the Chandra Asri petrochemicals
plant, due for completion by 1996, will require an ethylene price of more
than Dollars 500 a tonne to break even, compared with recent prices
averaging below Dollars 350 a tonne.
The company is elusive about which subsidiaries might be taken public,
although candidates include its trans-Java gas pipeline operations, a
five-star hotel in Bali and an aircraft leasing subsidiary.
Mr Afdhal says that only about six subsidiaries currently meet the Jakarta
stock exchange's listing requirements, which include audited accounts
recording an operating profit for more than two years.
Brokers argue Bimantara and other conglomerates close to the current
government are keen to complete the flotation before President Suharto, who
has led the country for over 25 years, leaves office.
By turning subsidiaries public and attracting foreign shareholders,
conglomerates will have a measure of protection against a political backlash
under a future government, says one observer.
Analysts question how attractive its subsidiaries will be to foreign
investors. When the group took its Plaza Indonesia hotel and shopping mall
subsidiary public last year, it preferred to place the shares almost
entirely with Indonesian state pension funds.
Brokers say the shares, which have seen almost no trade, are among the stock
market's most expensive on a price-to-earnings ratio.
Some of its subsidiaries, however, enjoy monopoly trading rights and have
attracted criticism. The World Bank in a recent report described Bimantara's
monopoly on citrus fruit trade in West Kalimantan, granted in 1991, as
'hurting poor farmers and less well-off customers. Unemployment and labour
migration have increased'.
Mr Afdhal says that 'competition is part of our life.' But he adds: 'For a
new company we would like protection from the government just to make sure
our investment does all right.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bondholders opt for YPF shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AROUND 13 per cent of YPF, Argentina's national oil company, has changed
hands under a Dollars 1bn option agreement with holders of government bonds.
Mr Alejandro Mayoral, economic policy undersecretary, said that about 85,000
people had swapped their holdings of government bonds, known as Bocons, for
a total of 46.5m shares in YPF, Argentina's largest company.
The government floated 45 per cent of YPF in June, raising Dollars 3.04bn
from local and foreign investors. A further 26 per cent was reserved for
holders of Bocons at the original flotation price of Dollars 19 a share.
In 1991 and 1992, the government issued Dollars 9.4bn worth of 10-year
floating rate Bocons to suppliers and pensioners in lieu of payment and
pension rights. Pension holders were offered Dollars 8.2bn in bonds
convertible into YPF shares. To win support for the flotation of YPF, the
government offered to buy back Bocons at 79 per cent of face value.
It is believed that many pensioners have sold their Bocons on the secondary
market, where they are currently fetching 83 per cent of face value.
YPF shares have risen by more than 25 per cent to Dollars 24, giving
investors and pensioners a substantial gain. However, the shares cannot be
sold for at least a year.
The government has issued a further Dollars 1.2bn in Bocons to suppliers.
They can also convert the bonds into equity, but will have to wait until
pensioners had taken up their rights.
Once conversion is completed, the government's holding in YPF will be
reduced to 20 per cent. Employees will own 10 per cent and private investors
70 per cent.
For the first half of 1993, YPF reported net income of Dollars 240m, up 80
per cent on the first half of 1992.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Man behind Bart Simpson holds
key to QVC bid - A look the choice facing shareholders in the Dollars 9.5bn
takeover contest for Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 9.5bn takeover bid launched by QVC Network for Paramount
Communications on Monday is riding on the reputation of a single man: Mr
Barry Diller, the entertainment industry executive behind television and
film hits ranging from The Simpsons cartoon series to the Indiana Jones
adventure movies.
When Mr Diller, one of the most respected figures in Hollywood, took a large
personal stake in QVC nine months ago and joined the business as chairman
and chief executive, he sparked a remarkable rise in the shares of this
humdrum cable television home-shopping company.
Mr Diller made clear not only that he saw an extremely exciting future for
home shopping, but that he intended to build QVC into a much broader based
company which would capitalise on the vast opportunities of the impending
age of interactive multi-media home entertainment.
The bid for Paramount, with assets ranging from the Paramount Pictures film
studios to the Prentice Hall book publishing company, represents a huge leap
towards Mr Diller's goal.
It has been made possible by the strength of QVC's share price, which rose
from around Dollars 38 when Mr Diller came aboard last December to a year's
high of Dollars 73 and stood at Dollars 56 1/8, up Dollars 1/8, at the close
yesterday.
The hostile QVC offer for Paramount consists largely of stock, with some
element of cash - as does that from rival bidder Viacom, the cable business
best known for its MTV pop music channel, which made an agreed offer nine
days ago.
Wall Street analysts think this is just the start of a bidding war involving
these two companies and, possibly, other large US and foreign media groups,
which could involve much larger doses of cash.
But for now, the strength of the two bids depends largely on the price Wall
Street accords QVC and Viacom shares, and that largely depends on
perceptions of the value the bidders would add to the Paramount business.
The 51-year-old Mr Diller has the advantage of one of Hollywood's most
distinguished creative records.
A drop-out from the University of California, he got his start in show
business in the mailroom of the William Morris talent agency, and then
became an agent himself.
He made his name as a programmer at the ABC network in the early 1970s, and
from 1974 to 1984 headed the Paramount studios, quitting to join Mr Rupert
Murdoch's nascent Fox TV network after repeated clashes with Mr Martin
Davis, the then new chairman of Paramount Communications. (One of the many
ironies of the QVC bid is the opportunity it could give Mr Diller to oust Mr
Davis, his old adversary.)
He left Mr Murdoch's News International empire in February last year,
wanting a company of his own to run, and after nine months of casting around
found it at QVC - a choice which amazed an entertainment industry which
regarded home shopping as little more than a butt for jokes.
QVC's other leading shareholders are two important cable television
companies, Comcast and Liberty Media, which are enthusiastically backing the
Paramount bid, pumping Dollars 1bn into QVC through an issue of convertible
stock.
QVC runs a 24-hour live cable channel over which it sells goods ranging from
jewellery through collectibles to cookware.
Mr Diller first gained an insight into its potential when he visited its
studios with Diane Von Furstenberg, the fashion designer, who amazed him by
selling Dollars 1.2m of dresses in just 100 minutes of airtime.
Futurists have been forecasting for years that home shopping is going to be
a huge business, yet throughout the 1980s it failed to take off.
Now, however, Mr Diller may have caught a breaking wave. QVC is already
growing strongly, with first-half revenues up 18 per cent to Dollars 536m
and underlying earnings up 57 per cent to Dollars 30.9m. Early next year, it
will add a new, more contemporary home shopping service, called Q2, to add
to its two shopping and fashion channels.
It is also in the throes of a stock swap merger with its chief rival, Home
Shopping Network. QVC, which reaches some 47m US homes, targets the upper
end of the market, while Home Shopping, with 60m homes, is more down-market.
However, there have been rumblings that some Home Shopping directors are
unhappy at the merger terms, and the Paramount bid could sideline this deal.
However big the promise of home shopping, it will be just one
entertainment/information segment in a multi-media industry which could
offer consumers hundreds of television channels.
For all the technological advances which make this possible, the key to
attracting viewers will be entertainment 'software' of the kind Mr Diller
produces so well. Yet Viacom too has shown itself to be on the cutting edge
of popular entertainment.
The choice facing Wall Street is between the man behind Bart Simpson and the
company ultimately responsible for the latest US teenage fad - two peurile
MTV cartoon characters called Beavis and Butt-head.

<TEXT>
THE share price of Tambrands, the US-based maker of Tampax tampons, dropped
by nearly 10 per cent yesterday after an announcement late on Monday that
the company's board had abandoned plans for a sale.
The Dollars 3 7/8 fall in Tambrands' share price to Dollars 42 yesterday
came in spite of an increase in Tambrands' quarterly dividend to 42 cents a
share from 38 cents.
The fall puts the shares back to the level at which they were trading before
market speculation about a sale first surfaced in June.
Tambrands has refused in recent months to confirm that it has been for sale.
However, Mr Howard Wentz, chairman, said yesterday: 'As part of a
comprehensive review of Tambrands' strategic alternatives, over the last
several months we explored the possibility of a sale of the company.'
He added that the board had 'decided that the best course is to continue to
run the business independently.'
It is not known whether Tambrands received any offers for the company.
The company, whose chief executive, Mr Martin Emmett, was ousted in June,
said it expected to announce new senior management shortly.

CREDITORS have closed in on Curragh, the Canadian lead-zinc producer, after
its failure to raise new equity, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Curragh, which has been in bankruptcy protection since April and has closed
mines in north-west Canada because of low base metal prices, has been trying
to raise up to CDollars 75m (USDollars 99m) in new equity since early last
year.
Mr Clifford Frame, chairman, negotiated a CDollars 50m infusion from Korea
Zinc and Samsung but the deal fell through. His attempts to find help in
Europe failed last week .
An Ontario court has put Curragh's Faro mine into receivership on behalf of
unsecured note-holders owed almost USDollars 250m.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday launched the initial volley in an
offensive to crack Intel's grip on the market for microprocessors used in
personal computers, writes Frank McGurty.
IBM has introduced a line of computers equipped with a new generation of
microprocessor, known as the PowerPC, developed over the past two years in
collaboration with Motorola and Apple Computer. The company hopes that the
PowerPC, which adapts IBM's existing RS/6000 technology for use in 'a
desktop personal computing environment', will eventually displace Intel's
microprocessors as the industry standard.
In what may prove a more important step towards that goal, IBM has begun
shipping the new chip to outside computer manufacturers, including Groupe
Bull of France.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Healthcare insurers prepare for
a shock to the system - Richard Waters previews a US medical revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUNNING a health insurance company used to be a simple business: you raised
premiums each year to match escalating medical costs, and processed
mountains of claims.
Not any more. Even before President Bill Clinton's planned healthcare
revolution, to be unveiled tonight, the largest US health insurers have been
going through a quiet revolution of their own. For those that can stay the
course after the shock to the system delivered by the president's plan, that
process is likely to accelerate.
Insurers, whose escalating premiums are for most Americans the clearest sign
of a medical system out of control, have long been regarded as the villains
of the US healthcare industry. That popular perception, they claim, has made
them an easy target for politicians.
The Clinton plan will effectively take control of underwriting away from
health insurers. According to an early draft of the plan, premium increases
will be controlled by a new National Health Board.
Insurers would also lose the power to refuse cover to people they consider
to be bad risks, or even to charge them a higher premium. The president's
plan envisages a return to 'community rating', a system of assessing
insurance premiums which insurers have turned their backs on in the past 20
years. This requires good and bad risks to be pooled, with a single premium.
Deprived of control over their pricing and underwriting, the Clinton plan
would force the health insurers to look again at their costs, continuing the
restructuring that has already been under way.
The attack on costs has already turned the big health insurers increasingly
into medical delivery companies. This involves them in everything from
making on-site inspections of hospital procedures and providing second
opinions on medical conditions, to contracting directly with networks of
hospitals and doctors to establish health care networks for their customers.
In this, they have been responding in part to the health maintenance
organisations (HMOs) and other managed care providers who have made big
inroads into US healthcare. Since the beginning of the 1970s, the number of
people covered by managed care arrangements has grown from less than 10m to
nearly 90m, rivalling the numbers covered under traditional indemnity
insurance plans.
Cigna and Aetna have moved faster in this direction than the three other
'big five' health insurers - Prudential, Travelers and Met Life. Aetna, for
instance, provides health insurance to 12m people of whom 3.1m are in
managed care arrangements such as HMOs (which provide healthcare services
for a fixed annual payment) and preferred provider organisations (or PPOs,
networks offering a discount to cover a large group of people).
For the other 8.9m people, Aetna has been striving to hold costs down by
reviewing medical procedures and getting second opinions. The result has
been an increase in overhead costs, but falling payments to providers. 'For
every Dollars 1 you spend, you save between Dollars 4 and Dollars 10,' says
Mr Will Jones, a director of Aetna's health insurance business.
The move into managed care, combined with three years of sharply rising
premiums and slowing inflation in healthcare costs, has made health
insurance a profitable business again after losses for much of the 1980s.
Cigna will make operating profits of Dollars 400m from the business this
year, compared with Dollars 275m at Aetna, estimates Mr Western Hicks, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. At a time when their property/casualty
operations are struggling to make a profit, such earnings are bailing out
some of the biggest insurance groups.
The regional health alliances, through which all consumers will end up
buying cover, will recommend only a handful of plans in their area: getting
on this list will make the difference between securing a large local market
and losing out altogether (only companies employing more than 5,000 will be
able to buy cover outside the alliances, providing too narrow a market to
support many local providers of health plans).
The big insurers, which tend to be thinly spread, could yet be squeezed out
of many areas by local HMOs and Blue Cross/Blue Service plans. A large local
market share gives a managed care organisation more clout to negotiate with
providers, says Mr David Koppe, treasurer of United Healthcare, an HMO which
covers 2.3m people. United, one of the largest HMOs, has concentrated on
being one of the two biggest providers in the 18 cities in which it
operates.
In this business, the big insurers have a long way to go. 'We don't feel the
competition is from the large insurance companies,' says Mr Koppe.

<TEXT>
ERIDANIA Beghin-Say, the sugar and foods group controlled by Italy's
troubled Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, underlined its
financial resilience in the face of its parent's difficulties with a 7 per
cent rise in net first-half profits, to FFr614m (Dollars 109.25m) from
FFr572m.
Mr Guido Rossi, the Ferfin chairman imposed by creditor banks earlier this
year, underlined the Paris-based company's importance to Ferruzzi when he
said the Ferruzzi rescue plan being studied by creditor banks did not
envisage a sale of Ferfin's majority stake.
The management of Eridania Beghin-Say, which has been trying to underline
its independence and financial health, said they had no intention of
divesting any activities acquired under Ferfin's control.
EBS has diversified into some branded consumer food sectors and pushed into
new markets in eastern Europe. Sales rose 3 per cent to FFr24.75bn, while
pre-tax earnings soared 32 per cent to FFr1.29bn.
EBS said all its main activities had either maintained or improved
profitability in the first half. With a 'favourable' outlook for the
remainder of the year, it predicted that full 1993 profits would probably
exceed 1992's FFr1.28bn
With attention focused on the financial problems of its controlling
shareholder, EBS stressed that its own ratio of borrowings to new equity had
remained virtually unchanged over the past six months, in spite of investing
about FFr300m on a new plant in eastern Germany.
EBS has been identified as one of the most appealing parts of the Ferfin
empire if there is a break-up, and a number of aspiring buyers have already
shown informal interest. The Paris government has said it would monitor
closely any plans to change the group's future ownership in view of its
strategic importance for the French farming sector.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: KNP BT plans rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM, VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, is to launch a one-for-five
rights issue as part of plans to boost to 90 per cent its stake in
Leykam-Murztaler, the loss-making Austrian paper group.
KNP BT said the malaise in the European paper industry had prompted it to
accelerate plans to integrate Leykam, in which it has owned a 50.4 per cent
stake since 1989. The Austrian bank Creditanstalt-Bankverein owns 25.2 per
cent of Leykam, and the rest is publicly-traded.
Under the deal, KNP BT will merge its two paper-producing divisions into
Leykam, which will then issue new shares. KNP BT will eventually own 90 per
cent of the enlarged company, including the shares now held by
Creditanstalt, which the Dutch company intends to acquire.
The remaining 10 per cent of Leykam's shares will continue to be traded in
Vienna and Frankfurt.
The company declined to give financial details, but noted that the merger of
the paper divisions would be carried out on a non-cash basis. Talks will be
held on acquiring Creditanstalt's shares.
Details of the KNP BT rights issue will be announced in the next few weeks.
The company currently has a market capitalisation of some Fl 3bn (Dollars
1.7bn). MacMillan Bloedel of Canada, which owns 17 per cent of KNP BT, says
it will take up its shares.
KNP BT said the rights issue would ensure that its solvency ratios remained
unchanged, counteracting the deterioration that would otherwise have
occurred through the full consolidation of Leykam.
Leykam, the biggest paper maker in Austria, is a leading producer of coated
wood-free paper.
KNP BT, whose own results have come under pressure from difficult market
conditions in Europe, said the move would increase its flexibility to
produce at lower costs. One immediate consequence is that it will be closing
down a smaller paper-producing machine at its plant in the Dutch town of
Nijmegen, with the loss of 250 jobs.
Creditanstalt-Bankverein has said it will not sell its 25.5 per cent stake
in Leykam back to KNP until next year. This, however, would not affect the
merger plan, said Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chief executive, writes Ian
Rodger in Vienna.
The bank has a put option to sell most of its stake to KNP, but does not
want to exercise it this year for tax reasons. At the Sch340 at which Leykam
shares traded yesterday, the Creditanstalt stake was worth roughly Sch800m
(Dollars 70.6m).
The bank, Austria's second-largest, also has a 2.5 per cent stake in KNP,
and intends to take up its rights in the forthcoming Fl 500m issue to
finance the takeover.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Michelin slumps to FFr3.2bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, plunged to a net loss of
FFr3.19bn (Dollars 567.6m) in the first six months of the year.
It blamed the recession in its European markets and exceptional charges
related to an ambitious cost-cutting plan.
The company, one of France's largest industrial groups, said the sharp
decline, from net profits of FFr820m in the first half of 1992, largely
reflected the impact of a FFr2.64bn provision for a rationalisation
programme. The scheme, announced in April, is aimed at cutting costs by
FFr3.5bn, or 10 per cent of the total, over the next two years.
Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said that the group had
decided to take all the restructuring costs in the first half of the year.
'We wanted to remove all uncertainty,' he said.
Even without the impact of exceptional charges, however, the group suffered
a sharp downturn. Operating profits fell 71 per cent, to FFr793m, on sales
down 12 per cent to FFr30.62bn. Michelin shares slipped FFr2.7 to FFr174.6.
The fall at the trading level was attributed to the depressed international
demand for cars and trucks.
Michelin said the recovery in the US market had failed to offset a sharp
fall in European and Japanese sales.
In the European market alone, car production fell 16 per cent in the first
six months, compared with last time. Output of trucks and commercial
vehicles fell by about 27 per cent. The UK was the only country to register
an improvement.
'We have to be prepared for a long-term crisis,' warned Mr Bourdais de
Charbonniere. He said the cost-cutting measures - which will reduce the
workforce to about 122,000 from the current 130,000 by the beginning of 1995
 -would strengthen the competitiveness of the group and free cash to cover
investments and reduced debts.
In spite of the difficult economic environment, the company reported some
encouraging signs. The market for replacement tyres - which are sold at
about twice the price of tyres which go directly to car manufacturers - had
seen an improvement in the second quarter. Demand in the US continued to
improve, although competition remains intense.
Michelin said it expected to report a profit in the US in 1994, after a loss
this year.
Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere expressed confidence that the group's debts
could be maintained at the current FFr29.9bn, because of productivity
improvements.
However, he said it was 'urgent that interest rates be brought down' to ease
the company's financial burden. A one percentage point cut in France,
Germany and Spain would reduce financial charges by about FFr150m, according
to the finance director.
Industry analysts said that the first-half performance was largely in line
with expectations. However, until consumer confidence improved in Michelin's
principal European markets, the outlook for trading would remain gloomy.
The need for the company to reduce stock levels in the second half is also
expected to affect capacity utilisation and profitability.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Pechiney blames aluminium
business for interim deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN recession and the depressed state of the aluminium market have
taken their toll on Pechiney, the state-controlled French aluminium group.
Yesterday it announced net losses of FFr397m (Dollars 70.6m) in the first
six months of the year, compared with net profits of FFr782m last time.
Sales at the group, which is on the government's list of 21 companies to be
sold as part of its privatisation campaign, fell from FFr34.01bn to
FFr31.3bn. Operating income declined from FFr1.83bn to FFr1.1bn.
Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, said there were 'extreme differences' between the
group's activities. Its single biggest problem, he said, is the aluminium
production business, which is suffering from falling prices and excess
supply.
He said the gloomy outlook for this division would prevent the group from
returning to profitability in the second half. The losses, however, were
expected to be 'noticeably less' than in the first half.
According to Mr Gandois, aluminium prices fell by about 10 per cent in the
first half of 1993 compared with the same period last year. He blamed the
impact of Russian imports and excess production by other international
manufacturers, and forecast that aluminium stocks would continue to rise.
Pechiney's chairman also expressed interest in a proposal by the French
industry ministry to combine with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone (CNR), the
French electricity generator.
'There would be advantages in having a stable supply of electricity,' said
Mr Gandois.
The French government is believed to be encouraging such an alliance with
CNR to make Pechiney more attractive before privatisation. Pechiney is
France's single largest consumer of electricity.
At the other end of the scale from aluminium, in terms of the group's
business divisions, was Pechiney International, the packaging group 67 per
cent-owned by Pechiney. Net profits here fell from FFr1.42bn to FFr439m, but
this was the result of large exceptional gains last year.
Excluding exceptionals, profits rose to FFr578m from FFr397m.
The rise in underlying profits reflected reduced financial and tax charges,
which offset a slowdown in demand for drinking cans and lower prices. The
group said the difficult business environment did not jeopardise the

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Japanese brokers forced to
revise profits forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading brokers were forced yesterday to revise their earnings
forecasts, with Nomura Securities, the largest house, cutting its expected
pre-tax profit to Y25bn (Dollars 240m) from Y35bn for the first half to the
end of this month.
The brokers complained of weaker-than-expected commissions on the Tokyo
market, where the daily value of turnover has been 10 per cent below
expectations, and the Nikkei index has hovered just above the 20,000 mark.
Of the 14 largest brokers, 12 have revised forecasts. Daiwa Securities was
the exception among the 'Big Four' houses, maintaining its pre-tax interim
forecast at Y30bn, having apparently increased bond commissions to
compensate for the stock market's weakness.
The other company not to make an announcement was Cosmo Securities, the
second-tier broker to be rescued by Daiwa Bank. Cosmo, crippled by losses
from the unauthorised shifting of stocks from client account to account, is
expecting a pre-tax loss of Y2bn.
Brokers say that although they are over the worst of the damage suffered
during the stock market collapse, nervousness remains about the health of
the Nikkei index, which hit 14,309.41 last August after peaking at 38,915.87
in late 1989.
The 10 second-tier brokers are still under extreme pressure, and will need
to cut costs in coming months. Only three - Kokusai Securities, New Japan
Securities, and Wako Securities - are expecting to record a pre-tax profit
in the first half.
The largest losses are expected at Sanyo Securities (Y5.7bn) and Kankaku
Securities (Y5.6bn). Meanwhile, Kokusai Securities, closely linked to
Nomura, forecast the largest pre-tax profit, Y4.5bn, among the second-tier
houses.
Tokyo stock prices have been flat in the past few weeks, and brokers are
disappointed that two government stimulative packages, along with falling
interest rates, have failed to attract more investors back to the market.
Bond commissions were weak early in the period, but have since improved,
while a spate of new listings has helped the larger brokers. Most are still
attempting to cut personnel costs, but have been restrained by the lifetime
employment system in Japan.
The 'Big Four' are generally in better shape than a year ago, but will still
need to shed further employees to improve profitability.
They will also face increased competition, particularly in the bond market,
through financial deregulation, which has allowed Japan's long-term credit
and trust banks to establish securities subsidiaries.
Of the larger houses, Nikko Securities had the sharpest revision, cutting
its pre-tax forecast from an optimistic Y30bn to Y10bn. Yamaichi Securities,
meanwhile, halved its pre-tax forecast from Y20bn.

FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canal-Plus rises 33% to FFr676m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANAL-PLUS, the French media group, lifted net interim profits by 33 per
cent, to FFr676m (Dollars 120.3m) from FFr507m in the first half of 1992. It
forecast 10 per cent growth in net earnings for the full year, to FFr1.2bn.
News of the rise at Canal-Plus, which expanded rapidly in the 1980s but last
year saw profits stabilise at FFr1.1bn, comes at a highly-sensitive time.
The company is preparing to renegotiate the terms of its original French
pay-TV franchise with the government.
It also coincides with intense speculation about the future of Canal-Plus'
relationship with Havas, the French leisure group that owns 23.5 per cent of
its equity. Havas is reported to be planning to add the 20.4 per cent of
Canal-Plus held by the Compagnie Generale des Eaux utilities concern to its
own stake, provided the government relaxes controls over television
ownership.
The rise in net profits at Canal-Plus disguised flat profits at the
operating level. Operating income fell marginally to FFr864m from FFr866m.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Expansion costs hold back Brake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COSTS of starting one business and expanding another held back operating
margins at Brake Brothers, the supplier of frozen and chilled foods to the
catering trade. As a result interim pre-tax profit was slightly ahead from
Pounds 7.12m to Pounds 7.14m.
'Although the UK catering market remains dull, we expect growth in sales and
are poised to take advantage of any recovery,' said Mr William Brake,
chairman. The company planned to continue expansion and had 'opportunities
under review'.
Margins at the operating level fell from 6.1 per cent to 4.8 per cent in the
six months to June 30 1993.
Operating profits of Pounds 7.78m (Pounds 7.68m) had lagged a partly organic
improvement in sales to Pounds 160.5m (Pounds 126.4m), because of the costs
of a continuing investment in a new chilled fine foods business. The costs
contributed towards a half year loss of Pounds 1.1m which had been absorbed
within the operating profits of the UK Foodservice division.
The French food distribution businesses, which contributed sales of Pounds
17.2m (Pounds 2m) lifted by two acquisitions for Pounds 3m cash, were 'only
at break even' at the operating level, as expected.
Also, in an unusual move, the company had depreciated freehold properties by
Pounds 250,000, the first time it had booked such a charge.
Country Choice Foods, a frozen products supplier to the independent bakery
market, acquired for shares in May at a price of between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 14m depending on profitability, contributed a maiden Pounds 3.85m to
turnover. Brake was 'pleased' with its progress.
Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditure totalled Pounds 7m, including
Pounds 3m on additions and replacements to the motor fleet, Pounds 700,000
on completion of a new Aberdeen satellite depot, and Pounds 500,000 to cover
premises in Birmingham for new chilled fine foods service.
Interest charges rose to Pounds 644,000 (Pounds 563,000). The balance sheet
'continued to be strong'.
From earnings per share of 10p (10.3p) the interim dividend is raised to 2p
(1.85p).

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Southern Newspapers ahead at Pounds 7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOSTED BY a disposal surplus and lower interest charges, Southern
Newspapers, the regional newspaper group, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds
7.51m for the 53 weeks ended July 3 1993, against Pounds 7m for the previous
year.
In line with the continuing difficult trading conditions on the south coast,
advertisement revenue fell by over 2 per cent, but this was offset by gains
in contract printing revenue and newspaper sales revenue to give an overall
lift in turnover from Pounds 69.55m to Pounds 71m.
Earnings per share were higher at 22.73p (17.75p) and the total dividend is
stepped up to 11.8p (11.25p) with a final payment of 8.8p (8.25p).
Operating profits were lower at Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 7.23m) but a Pounds
693,000 (Pounds 168,000) surplus on the disposal of investments and lower
interest charges of Pounds 143,000 (Pounds 580,000), left the pre-tax figure
ahead of the previous year.
Mr John Salkeld, chairman, stated that since the year end there had been an
improvement in trading levels of both the newspaper and contract printing
divisions which, with firm cost control, 'augurs well for the future.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Mucklow record ends with 11% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECORD of 24 years of unbroken profit growth has ended at A&amp;J Mucklow
Group, the West Midlands based property investor and developer, as it
finally succumbed to recessionary pressures.
The group reported pre-tax profits down 11 per cent from Pounds 10.9m to
Pounds 9.67m for the year ended June 30. Earnings per share slipped to 6.42p
(7.72p) while the dividend is stepped up to 6.103p (5.925p) with a final of
3.14p.
Net asset value per ordinary share had fallen from 155p to 144p by the end
of the period.
Mr Albert Mucklow, chairman, said that in spite of continued expansion, the
group's investment portfolio 'could not escape the fall in property values
generally throughout the UK.'
The level of new lettings had failed to counteract the effect of tenant
failures and non-renewal of leases. The group's vacant space increased from
1.16m sq ft to 1.32m sq ft during the year.
However, there was 'considerable evidence' that the worst of the recession
was now past, and he expected the vacancy level to start falling.
A professional review had given the industrial and commercial property
portfolio a value of Pounds 206.8m, which involved a reduction in the
revaluation reserve of Pounds 11.1m. These figures have been incorporated in
the accounts.
A review of the group's other property, including its residential land bank,
gave rise to a surplus of Pounds 8.51m above book value, which has not been
incorporated in the accounts.
Rental income and turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 18.6m
to Pounds 20.1m, giving an operating profit of Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 14.6m).
Also there was Pounds 89,000 (Pounds 62,000) made from the disposal of
properties.
Net interest paid rose from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 5.8m.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CI makes Pounds 0.91m in difficult trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CI GROUP, the steel and engineering combine, reported a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 905,000 for the six months ended July 31 1993, compared with Pounds
860,000 adjusting for FRS 3.
Mr Patrick McTighe, chairman, said overall sales were held at Pounds 35.3m
but at the expense of margins. Operating profit fell from Pounds 2.19m to
Pounds 1.35m but was maintained at a similar level to the second half of
last year.
Interest payable dropped 24 per cent to Pounds 375,000. Exceptional items of
Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 101,000) were charged and the previous half year
suffered a Pounds 558,000 loss on sale of discontinued operations.
The chairman said the outlook for those sectors which affected group
business was 'still far from clear' and progress for the rest of the year
was likely to remain constrained.
Given current trading conditions it could well be the latter part of the
financial year, at the earliest, before 'we see the benefit of any
recovery,' he added.
Earnings per share for the half year came to 0.69p (same). The interim
dividend is 0.4p (0.825p).

Korea-Europe Fund raised net asset value by 14.3 per cent to Dollars 5.51
per share at the end of June, 1993, against Dollars 4.82 a year earlier.
This compared to a 33.7 per cent increase in US dollar terms in the KSE
Composite Stock Price Index. The trust said the underperformance was largely
because of the overweighting in smaller companies which had been responsible
for a significant outperformance over the same period last year.
Net available revenue for the year was Pounds 923,000 (Pounds 602,000).
Earnings per share came to 3.22 cents (2.1 cents) and the dividend has been

WOLSTENHOLME RINK, Lancashire-based printing industry supplier, announced
pre-tax profits 20 per cent ahead from Pounds 1.68m to Pounds 2.02m for the
first half of 1993, on turnover of Pounds 26.6m, against Pounds 24.7m.
The result, which followed a 49 per cent jump in profit to Pounds 3.46m for
1992, reflected a recovery at Charles Openshaw following a reorganisation,
and a cut in interest costs from Pounds 401,000 to Pounds 215,000.
Following the period end the company acquired the resins and varnish
business of Leon Frenkel. It will make a contribution in the last five
months of the present year.
Earnings per share were 16.8p (14p) and the interim dividend is raised from
6.5p to 6.8p.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Frogmore rises 10% to Pounds 10.7m -
Sufficient resources to benefit from position of low gearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROGMORE ESTATES, the property company which raised Pounds 42m through a
rights issue last month, boosted pre-tax profits for the year ended June 30
by 10 per cent to Pounds 10.7m.
Earnings per share increased by 25 per cent to 21.8p (17.4p), helped by the
company's buy-back of 5.2m shares from Markheath, another property company,
for Pounds 13.1m in November 1992. Net assets were 409p a share (411p).
Mr Phillip Davies, managing director, said yesterday that the company was
well pleased with the results: 'Against the backcloth of a really difficult
year we have held our net asset value and improved both the profits and the
dividend. We have put the company in a position of low gearing, with
sufficient resources to benefit from this point in the property cycle.'
Operating profits rose from Pounds 12m to Pounds 15.6m on turnover ahead at
Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 41.6m).
The latest operating figure includes a charge of Pounds 1.52m for litigation
costs arising from a dispute over the acquisition of Land Investors by BCPH
in 1986. No further costs are expected.
Most of the gain at the operating level came from higher rental income. The
company said the contracted rent roll was up 6 per cent to Pounds 19.3m
(Pounds 18.2m). It had no developments in progress or vacant buildings of
any significance.
Shares of profits from associates were Pounds 157,000 compared with a
previous loss of Pounds 518,000.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 1.75m to Pounds 5.1m. Mr Davies said
this reflected increase in borrowings following the share buy-back and the
purchase of new properties.
Net borrowings were Pounds 66m (Pounds 46m) at the year-end, giving gearing
of 43 per cent (28 per cent). However, borrowings had fallen since the
rights issue, although the group has spent Pounds 21m on acquisitions, Mr
Davies said.
A final dividend of 12.4p (11.6p) is proposed, giving a total for the year
of 16p (15p).

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;S Unit Trust replaces manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS and Spencer Unit Trust Management, the unit trust arm of the clothing
retailer, said it has replaced one of its three quantitative fund management
companies with a manager offering a traditional stock selection approach.
Some leading pension fund consultants have recently been urging clients to
consider selecting managers with contrasting styles to avoid a concentration
of investment in a single type of stock or sector.
Mr Robert Colville, managing director of M&amp;S Unit Trust Management Ltd, said
the shift occurred in the company's UK Selection Portfolio with Pounds 220m
in assets which invests exclusively in UK equities.
Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford has replaced Delaware International Advisers
as investment managers of 30 per cent of the assets effective October 1. The
two other managers are BZW Investment Management - which uses quantitive
techniques to invest in a portfolio of stocks that matches the FT-A All
Share Index - and GMO Woolley - which uses quantitative techniques to pick
so-called value stocks. Delaware had been using quantitative techniques to
develop so-called dividend discount models.
'We are conscious of too great a similarity in the management styles of
Delaware and the other two investment managers', Mr Colville said.
While performance of all three managers has been very good over the past 18
months, a recent analysis of equities in all three portfolios showed a heavy
concentration in what are regarded as cyclical stocks, an exposure which he
believes is unlikely to offer the best returns in the future.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HERRING Baker Harris Group, the chartered surveyors, fell Pounds 1.08m into
the red in the six months to July 31, against a Pounds 1.63m pre-tax profit
last time.
The result was after charging Pounds 840,000 arising from the company's
decision to withdraw from the US following substantial losses there. The
company is winding down its New York operation and disposing of its and
Denver office to local management.
Turnover from continuing operations fell to Pounds 7.86m (Pounds 9.43m).
Losses per share were 8.95p (6.24p earnings) and the interim dividend has
been cut to 0.5p (3.25p).

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Weak consumer demand and falling car
production hit BSG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSG INTERNATIONAL, the Birmingham-based motor components, vehicle
distribution and childcare products group, has blamed weak consumer demand
and falling European car production for flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.53m
in the first half of 1993, compared with Pounds 8.56m.
The result, which the company said had been held back by difficult trading
conditions at the end of 1992 and earlier this year, were achieved on higher
turnover of Pounds 291.8m (Pounds 287.3m).
Although the decline in profitability had been offset by falling interest
rates and funds raised by the Pounds 31.4m rights issue in April, earnings
per share fell from 2.53p to 2.07p. The interim dividend is maintained at
0.7p.
Mr Astley Whittall, chairman, said the reduced earnings reflected a higher
tax charge arising from increased profits in Germany and the impact of the
rights shares.
A 15 per cent fall in European car production increased the pressure on
margins in the group's UK and French sun roof and mirror manufacturing
operations.
In the meantime, growth in the car leasing sector was hampered by fleet
users delaying vehicle replacements, the directors stated.
Recession in the airline industry, meanwhile, also dampened demand for BSG
equipment for aircraft interiors. Mr Whittall warned that the sector would
have to be restructured in the fourth quarter to reduce costs and improve
efficiency.
The difficulties of these sectors contributed to a 5.6 per cent decline in
interim operating profits to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.7m).
Nevertheless, Mr Whittall said satisfactory performances by operations in
Australia and the US, and improved profits on production of child safety
seats, were encouraging.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Allen seeks Pounds 5m and full listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLEN, the Wigan-based housebuilding, hire services and contracting group,
is raising about Pounds 5m after expenses by a placing and open offer of
4.44m shares. It is also seeking to move up from the USM to a listing.
Of the proceeds Pounds 2.5m will be spent on expanding the number of land
bank sites from the current 29 to about 35. The company said it only bought
land if a suitable return could be expected. The approach had resulted in
not having to make provisions against its land bank throughout the
recession.
A further Pounds 2m will be spent on hire services. It is negotiating to
acquire a six-outlet small tool hire chain for about Pounds 1m and plans to
spend about Pounds 30,000 apiece on its existing outlets.
In contracting, the group is in talks to acquire a Midlands-based contractor
for about Pounds 400,000.
The directors have forecast that pre-tax profits for the six months to
September 30 would be not less than Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 855,000), that
earnings would be at least 3.6p (2.5p) per share and that the interim
dividend would be maintained at 1.65p.
The shares are being placed at 119p per share and shareholders can apply on
a one-for-five basis. The issue has been underwritten by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd and the brokers are de Zoete &amp; Bevan. The shares closed down 2p at
130p.
Mr Ken Fox, deputy managing director, said the move up from the USM to the
senior market would change and raise the profile of the group, widen its
institutional shareholder base, and offer more opportunities for raising
further funds, if necessary.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ICD rejects request for seats on board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Communication &amp; Data, the marketing services company, has
rejected requests from PSB Group for two seats on the ICD board. PSB, the
direct marketing company, owns 1.93 per cent of the ordinary shares of ICD,
yet has voting rights over 22.61 per cent.
ICD has also denied that another deal it has been pursuing has fallen
through.
The ICD board representation was requested by Mr Jonathan Self, PSB deputy
chairman, who and asked for one seat for himself and one for Mr John Porter,
who is thought to own 5 per cent of ICD's equity. Mr Porter is son of Dame
Shirley Porter, erstwhile leader of Westminster's Conservative group.
Mr Self said: 'In discussions, Mr (David) Cicurel (ICD chairman) confirmed
that the major advertising agency who he had hoped would undertake a reverse
takeover of ICD had now withdrawn from discussions.'
For his part, Mr Cicurel, the company doctor who has restored ICD to
profitability, strongly denied that he confirmed to Mr Self the nature of
the transaction, and that he had told Mr Self that the deal was off.
Indeed, Mr Cicurel stressed that talks with the possible merger partner were
continuing.
Mr Self said that PSB intended 'to place ourselves in a position where we
can request an EGM' to gain representation on the ICD board.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Aer Lingus faces a wing-clipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between management and unions at Aer Lingus, the troubled Irish state
airline, arrive at a crucial juncture this Friday, when a deadline for the
acceptance of 1,280 proposed voluntary redundancies is reached.
In Brussels, officials say the European Community is likely to ask the
airline for more information before it decides whether to support a request
for a IPounds 175m capital injection from the Irish government. The EC is
due to make a preliminary ruling by early next month on whether planned
state aid for Aer Lingus and three other EC airlines breaches competition
rules.
To date, only about 300 acceptances are believed to have been notified to
management from the airline's 5,500 workforce, raising the spectre of
compulsory redundancies, which the airline's trade unions have pledged to
fight.
Significantly, senior figures within the Labour party, the junior partners
in the coalition government, have also said they will not support compulsory
redundancies, threatening a dangerous split in the coalition and a possible
government crisis in the weeks ahead.
The redundancies are being sought as part of a rescue plan drawn up earlier
this year by Aer Lingus management to cut operating costs by 10 per cent, or
some IPounds 50m annually, to staunch losses, which are currently running at
IPounds 1.2m a week. At March 31 this year Aer Lingus had accumulated net
debt of IPounds 540m.
When Mr Bernie Cahill, the executive chairman, unveiled the rescue plan last
June he said that 'urgent and drastic action is needed' if the airline was
to survive. The urgency of that message was heightened by a threat from the
banks to shut the financial taps to the company if a rescue plan was not in
place by late summer.
Management and unions then agreed over the summer to a complex three-phase
conciliation and arbitration procedure, through Ireland's Labour Relations
Commission. That procedure faces a deadline of October 31, and to date very
little progress has been achieved according to sources close to the
negotiations.
The banks apparently have accepted to await the outcome of the arbitration
procedure before taking action themselves, but according to a company
source, practically all of the airline's committed credit lines from the
banks will have expired by then. Thus if the rescue plan is still in dispute
at that time, the banks would technically be in a position to call in a
receiver.
The government's IPounds 175m equity injection is conditional both on EC
approval and on acceptance of Mr Cahill's rescue plan by the workforce. If
the plan is approved, the first instalment of IPounds 50m would be disbursed
in December.
The European Commission's policy on state aid is being challenged by British
Midland, Aer Lingus's main rival on the Dublin-London route.
Sir Michael Bishop, the British Midland chairman, said that Aer Lingus's
financial problems were partly caused by exaggeratedly low Dublin-London
fares. Pointing out that the Irish airline - although roughly the same size
as British Midland - employed 8,000 people compared with his own company's
2,500. 'They (Aer Lingus) are knocking up staggering losses,' Sir Michael
said, adding that a decision by the Commission to block the request for
IPounds 175m aid would be 'progress'.
But he said the EC also had to crack down on state aid for Belgium's Sabena,
Spain's Iberia Airlines and Air Portugal. 'If they (loss-making airlines)
know they are not going to get any more injections of state aid, then they
will have to put their businesses in order in the same way as everyone else
has done.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Starmin shareholders back Abdullah
reappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of Starmin, the loss-making quarry products company chaired by
Lord Parkinson, the former Conservative cabinet minister, yesterday backed
the reappointment of a director who is considering taking legal action
against the company.
Mr Raschid Abdullah, who speaks for about 30 per cent of the shares,
retained a non-executive seat on the board after his position came up for
confirmation at the meeting, it being his turn to retire by rotation.
Mr Abdullah, and his brother Osman, resigned as executive directors in July,
a month before the company rescinded its dividend and announced 1992 pre-tax
losses had been understated by Pounds 3.8m, deepening them to Pounds 11.9m.
The adjustment followed a review of accounting policies that focused on
profits booked on asset swaps.
Lord Parkinson, whose job attracts an annual salary of Pounds 25,000,
confirmed the possibility of legal action against the company by either or
both of the brothers, who had run Starmin since 1989.
During yesterday's meeting, which lasted just 18 minutes, Lord Parkinson
said, in response to shareholders' queries, that Mr Raschid Abdullah, his
family and allied interests 'do speak for nearly 30 per cent of shareholders
and they feel that it is right that that 30 per cent should be represented
on the board'.
He said the board, which abstained in the vote, believed it would not be in
the interests of the company or shareholders for him to comment further
because of the possibility of legal action.
Mr Raschid Abdullah refused to comment and is understood to have reached no
firm decision on legal action.

Pre-tax profits of MTL Instruments, the USM-quoted maker of electronic

to comply with FRS 3.
Turnover, however, rose by 15 per cent from Pounds 9.29m to Pounds 10.7m.
The improvement, the directors said, reflected strong recovery in the US and
continued growth in Europe. The weaker pound had benefited both sales and

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Yule Catto in Pounds 30m rights to fund
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YULE CATTO, the industrial chemicals group, is to raise Pounds 29.7m through
the first rights issue in its history to buy 50 per cent of a German
synthetic rubber latex company and to reduce debt.
It is is paying Pounds 18.2m for the purchase of the stake in Synthomer
Chemie from Chemetall, ultimately owned by Metallgesellschaft, after a
one-for-six rights issue at 215p.
The shares fell 18p to 259p on news of the rights and the group's interim
results for the six months to June 30, which disclosed a pre-tax profits
fall from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 9.26m on sales up 12 per cent at Pounds
140.6m.
The deal will strengthen Yule Catto's links with Reichhold Chemicals of the
US, the subsidiary of Dainippon Ink of Japan. Reichhold owns the other 50
per cent of Synthomer and is also the joint venture partner in Doverstrand,
another latex joint venture with Yule Catto.
Mr Alex Walker, Yule Catto chief executive, said bringing the two joint
ventures together under common ownership would open up opportunities to
rationalise marketing, research and manufacturing and help create a
pan-European synthetic latex rubber business.
For the year ended September 30 1992 Synthomer made profits before
exceptional items of Pounds 6.4m and profits before tax of Pounds 3.8m. Its
net assets were Pounds 7.1m.
The rights issue would also reduce group gearing, which at the end of the
first half was 43 per cent on net debt slightly up on the same period last
year at Pounds 20.7m.
Earnings per share fell from 7.5p to 6.5p but the interim dividend is lifted
from 2.5p to 2.6p.
Mr Walker said the fall in profits mainly stemmed from the poor performance
of the building products division in Holland, Belgium and France.
Yule Catto's largest shareholder, Kuala Lumpur Kepong, which owns 29.5 per
cent, has irrevocably agreed to take up its rights. The balance is
underwritten by Morgan Grenfell.
Lord Catto, chairman, said the bringing of Synthomer and Doverstrand under
common ownership would strengthen the international business.
'Doverstrand has enjoyed a long standing technical and commercial
relationship with Synthomer through its common shareholder, Reichhold
Chemicals,' he said.

Following this, the joint venture would lodge a full planning application.
Minorco, a 24.5 per cent shareholder in Ivernia and Ivernia's intended 50
per cent partner in the project, has made loans of some Dollars 3m (Pounds
1.9m) available to the company along with sums to cover land acquisition
costs.
Progress on the project has been balked by difficulties arising from
Chevron's decision to dispose of its 52.5 per cent interest in Lisheen.
Chevron had agreed to sell its interest to Ivernia, and had accepted a
Dollars 5m deposit. However, completion of the sale has been delayed by a
challenge in the Dublin High Court by Lac Minerals.
Ivernia also announced that agreement had been reached for the disposal of
its Famous Blue gold deposit along with its Double A plant and equipment for
ADollars 1.2m (Pounds 510,000) in cash and shares.
All of Ivernia's remaining Australian assets have been acquired by Leader
Resources, in which Ivernia has a 20.5 per cent interest.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest helps Mayborn advance 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAYBORN GROUP, the fabric dyes, baby products and florists' sundries
concern, made further steady progress in the first half of 1993 and helped
by a sharp fall in interest charges, pre-tax profits rose by 14 per cent to
Pounds 1.9m, against Pounds 1.66m.
Turnover of the USM-quoted group edged up 3 per cent to Pounds 17.5m.
However, on a more comparable basis - after adjusting for the effect of
recent transfers of Dylon operations (fabric dyes) in France and the US to
independent distributors - the increase was 5 per cent.
At the operating level, profits grew 4 per cent to Pounds 1.93m. before
interest charges of Pounds 34,000 (Pounds 195,000). Earnings per share rose
to 6.4p (5.8p) and an increased interim dividend of 1.8p (1.6p) has been
declared.
Mr Ian Peacock, chairman, said trading in the second half was expected to
show more satisfactory growth. The baby products side in particular, would
benefit from significant Christmas gift orders already received and
confirmed.
Rainbow Acrylics - an importer and distributor of melamine and acrylic
children's tableware products acquired in July - was unlikely to have a
material impact on this year's results.
Net borrowings at the half year were Pounds 841,000 (Pounds 2.84m) giving
gearing of 9 per cent (36 per cent). This was higher than the year end
figure of Pounds 194,000, but Mr Peacock said it represented more normal
seasonal trading fluctuations and 'we have every reason at present to expect
another healthy cash position at the end of December 1993.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional leaves Comac at Pounds 60,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Comac Group, the USM-quoted computer consultant, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 60,000, against Pounds 44,000, for the half year ended June 30.
These were the first results since Mr Philip Swinstead, the founder and
former chief executive of SD Scicon, took a controlling interest and
installed a new management. The profit was after an exceptional charge of
Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 50,000) relating to directors termination costs and
German payroll taxes for earlier years.
Mr Bernard Friend, the new chairman, said that UK margins remained under
pressure and business abroad fell significantly in the six months.
However, there were the first signs of an upturn following policy changes by
the new management.
Turnover was Pounds 5.3m, compared with Pounds 4.91m. Earnings per share
were up from 0.44p to 0.65p.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate turns in 3.3% advance to
Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIXTON ESTATE, the UK's seventh largest property company, yesterday
announced a 3.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds
13m for the six months ended June 30.
Mr Douglas Gardner, chairman, said there had been a marked increase in
activity in the property investment market over the past few months.
Brixton said that there had been an increased number of tenant inquiries,
which was likely to lead to a resumption of rental growth in the second half
of 1994.
Rental income increased by 13.8 per cent to Pounds 28.4m. Inter-est charges
rose from Pounds 11m to Pounds 13.9m, as the develop-ment programme was
completed.
In May, the company announced a two-for-five rights issue to raise Pounds
100.7m. Brixton has since spent Pounds 17m on London property. It intends to
invest the full proceeds of the rights issue on industrial buildings and
multi-let offices in the next year.
Brixton said it had completed rent reviews on more than 900,000 sq ft of UK
property, with average rent increases of over 14 per cent. About 7.5 per
cent of its UK offices are empty.
Overseas, Brixton expects rental income from its 650,000 sq ft of industrial
and warehouse space in Dusseldorf to increase during the year.
Earnings per share rose by 6.2 per cent to 5.99p (5.64p). The interim
dividend is increased by 2.4 per cent to 2.825p (2.76p) per share.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bodycote bolstered by metal division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER RESULTS from Bodycote International's metal technology division
offset a downturn in its two other areas - workwear and industrial - leaving
group pre-tax profits 1.8 per cent ahead at Pounds 6.52m in the first half
of 1993. The shares fell 5p to 304p.
Mr Joe Dwek, chairman, reported an encouraging outlook for the metal
technology activities, now 74 per cent of group profits, and signs of
recovery in its UK-based industrial activities. However, EHCO-KLM, which
sells workwear and protective clothing mainly in Germany and the
Netherlands, was hit by the worsening recession there. Mr Dwek said it was
cutting costs and attempting to increase market share.
The interim dividend is up from 1.875p to 2p, and earnings per share rose
5.6 per cent to 7.68p (7.27p) helped by a lower tax rate.
Group sales were 1 per cent higher at Pounds 37.7m, and interest charges
took Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 102,000). Sales by the metal technology division
rose 20.4 per cent to Pounds 21.2m, helped by the purchase of Industrial
Materials Technology in March 1992. Pre-tax profits from the division,
before central costs, rose 19.5 per cent to Pounds 5.15m.
EHCO-KLM's profits fell 37.7 per cent to Pounds 629,000 on sales 10.1 per
cent lower at Pounds 12.7m, and the industrial division made profits of
Pounds 1.15m, down 20.7 per cent on sales 32 per cent down at Pounds 3.77m.
Net current assets at June 30 showed a rise from Pounds 24.18m to Pounds
27.6m. Cash at hand and in the bank rose from Pounds 14.78m to Pounds 17.3m,
while stocks increased from Pounds 11.22m to Pounds 12.27m over the 12
months.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: JIB calls for Pounds 19.9m to fund
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JIB GROUP, the international insurance broker ultimately owned by Jardine
Matheson, yesterday announced a rights issue and the planned acquisition of
Nicolls Pointing, a London based wholesale and reinsurance group.
It is raising Pounds 19.9m net by offering 13.8m shares at 150p apiece on a
one-for-eight basis. Yesterday the shares fell 7p to 169p.
Jardine Matheson, whose subsidiaries own 62.5 per cent of JIB, is committed
to subscribe for its entitlement of 8.64m shares. The remainder will be
underwritten by Robert Fleming and brokers are Cazenove.
Consideration for Nicolls Pointing, which specialises in the energy and
marine insurance sectors and in reinsurance business, is an initial Pounds
15.5m, comprising Pounds 6.75m cash, 2.53m ordinary shares valued at Pounds
4.4m, and Pounds 4.4m of convertible loan notes.
A further consideration of up to Pounds 3.2m will be paid in shares and loan
notes if Nicolls Pointing's profits after tax exceed Pounds 1.65m for 1993
up to a level of Pounds 2m. Last year Nicolls Pointing reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.99m on turnover of Pounds 5.7m.
Mr Nick Cosh, JIB finance director, said the acquisition, the biggest since
the group floated in November 1991, would significantly increase its
presence in the wholesale market. He predicted further efficiencies, leading
to enhanced earnings for JIB.
The rights issue will finance the cash element of the proposed acquisition.
It will also be used to refinance several smaller acquisitions made in the
last two years at a total cost of Pounds 15m, of which Pounds 4m was
deferred.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Personnel helps Hays rise 20% - Warning
that the climb out of recession will be long and slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYS, the business services group, reported a 20 per cent increase in annual
profits, but warned that 'the climb out of recession looks as if it will be
long and slow'.
Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman, said many Hays businesses had seen
trading conditions improve over the past few months, but the experience had
not been universal.
He added: 'The recent turmoil within the ERM and the consequential effective
devaluation of a number of European currencies, will make it harder for the
UK to continue its improving economic performance.'
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 55.6m to Pounds 66.6m in the year to June
30, on sales that grew from Pounds 380m to Pounds 477m.
Hays said both its distribution and commercial businesses had continued
their steady growth. The personnel division increased profits by 40 per
cent, as activity in the recruitment market increased during the second
half, especially for temporary placements of accountancy and technical
staff.
Although personnel operating profits jumped from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 6.7m,
they still only accounted for 10 per cent of the total.
Distribution increased operating profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 38m.
Profits from Hays Network Distribution, which provides multi-user
warehousing mainly for the drinks industry, were well down. The group said
management had been changed and the business had been set on the road to
recovery.
Hays Chemical Distribution's profits were flat, with a drop in margins from
bulk chemicals being offset by growth in packaged products.
Hays Fril, the French distribution company that the group bought for Pounds
37.5m in June last year, performed ahead of expectations. Together with
Mordhorst, the German distributor, of which Hays bought control for an
initial Pounds 32m in July, Mr Frost said he now had the basis of a
pan-European distribution business.
Profits from the commercial, or office support, businesses rose by 16 per
cent to Pounds 24.2m. Britdoc, which send letters and documents, won many
new customers, including four clearing banks.
Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 11.5p (10p). The interim dividend
was increased by 15 per cent from 4.6p to 5.3p.
COMMENT
Hays shares rose 5p to 255p on the strength of these figures, which were at
the top end of the analysts' range. Mr Frost remains as ebullient as ever
about the medium to long-term growth outlook but clearly does not want to
inflate expectations. The group had problems in bulk chemicals, but has
moved swiftly to sort out the network distribution to bonded warehouses. The
personnel business is at last benefiting from recovery and Britdoc continues
to shine on the commercial side. Forecasts of Pounds 84m put the shares on a
prospective multiple of 18.2. That 20 per cent premium to the market does
not look unjustified for a company that should be able to grow earnings by
more than 20 per cent, and claims to have management capable of doubling the
size of the business.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare hit by property losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRESTACARE, the nursing home operator that appointed a new chief executive
in March and raised Pounds 31.6m through a placing in July, reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.39m in the half year to June 30, compared with a
profit of Pounds 60,000.
However, Mr Andrew Taee, the chief executive, said that operating profits
from the nursing home business had risen 39 per cent to Pounds 2.51m (Pounds
1.8m) on turnover up 26 per cent at Pounds 10.4m. The interim dividend is
raised from 0.1p to 0.25p. The shares fell 5p to 37p.
The losses were caused by non-recurring debits of Pounds 2.67m, including
Pounds 2.29m of losses, realised or anticipated, on sales of non-core
properties. These were valued at Pounds 9.43m in the end 1992 balance sheet.
Most have been sold or were under contract for sale, and CrestaCare expected
to find buyers for the remaining Pounds 500,000-worth over the next year.
The remaining Pounds 380,000 largely related to compensation for Mr John
McAllister, the former chief executive, who had been on a three year rolling
contract at Pounds 100,000 a year. Mr Brian O'Connor, who resigned as
chairman in July, did not receive any compensation. Mr Taee has a
three-year, fixed-term contract at Pounds 150,000 a year.
By the end of the half-year the group operated 1,625 beds (1,425) in 26
homes, with 20 owned by CrestaCare. With the placing proceeds, it bought
eight homes with 515 beds for Pounds 14.1m. These are expected to be
re-registered by October 1 making a contribution in the final quarter. After
that acquisition net debt was Pounds 5m, for gearing of 8 per cent.
Mr Graeme Hart, chairman, said the homes' occupancy rate was more than 92
per cent after a slowing of referrals when the new community care
legislation came into force in April. This was lower than the group had
planned. He said there was pressure on weekly fee rates and CrestaCare
expected 'no overall increase for the next 18 months'.
Group turnover was Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 15.9m) and interest charges took
Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.66m). There was a loss per share of 2p (nil).

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Philip Harris warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Philip Harris dived 50p to 154p as the pharmaceutical and
scientific equipment supplier warned that profits in the current year would
be unlikely to match last time's and that, in particular, this would be
reflected in the results for the first six months to September 30.
The company said that shareholders had been 'cautioned' by the board at the
time of the preliminary results and the subsequent annual meeting.
Exports, which last year accounted for 30 per cent of the education and
scientific side, were running more than 50 per cent below 1992 levels
because of deepening recession in continental Europe, the main export
market. Expected substantial orders had been cancelled and no significant
overseas contracts had been secured.
In the UK, recession had hit the market for sales of scientific equipment,
especially that of a capital nature, to industrial customers.
The cost base in the education and scientific division had been reduced,
with a redundancy programme for 9 per cent of the workforce here being
implemented. This cost will hit the first half with the benefit being felt
in the second.

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tesco disappoints with modest 3.4% interim
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO made waves in the retail industry yesterday with its comments on
pricing and the threat from discounters, but disappointed the markets with
an increase in pre-tax profits of only 3.4 per cent.
Interim profits for the 24 weeks to August 14 were Pounds 261.5m (Pounds
252.8m). That included a Pounds 3.7m loss on the sale of properties but was
well below analysts' forecasts of between Pounds 268m and Pounds 275m. Total
sales increased 9.5 per cent to Pounds 3.99bn. The shares fell 4p to 211p
yesterday.
Tesco said its gross margin had declined by about 0.1 percentage points
during the period, and was currently about 0.2 points down on last year -
the first decline for about eight years. The operating margin was unchanged
at 6.9 per cent.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said Tesco's decision to sharpen prices was
bearing fruit in terms of increased sales, and the seven new stores opened
in the first half were among the most successful the company had opened.
They were already outperforming the Tesco average of weekly sales of Pounds
16 per square foot, and contributed 8.4 percentage points of the overall
sales increase.
Like-for-like sales, which exclude the contribution from new stores,
increased 2.1 per cent. Although all of the increase was accounted for by
inflation, that represents an improvement on last year, when like-for-like
sales fell 0.9 per cent after inflation.
Sir Ian said sales were currently 10 per cent ahead of last year.
Like-for-like sales were up 3 per cent, with inflation about 2 per cent.
Mr David Reid, finance director, refused to speculate on future margin
movements but said Tesco's commitment to competing on price did not
necessarily mean lower operating margins. There was still considerable scope
for cutting operating costs through sales-based ordering and better stock
control.
Tesco also said it was reducing the average cost of new stores from about
Pounds 22m to about Pounds 16m, which means it does not need to achieve such
high operating margins in order to maintain its current return on capital.
It plans to open about 25 stores a year, including large superstores,
compact superstores in smaller towns, and the Tesco Metro high-street
format.
Capital expenditure this year will be about Pounds 725m, of which Pounds
550m relates to new stores.
Earnings per share rose 4.5 per cent to 9.45p, and the interim dividend was
2.45p (2.25p).
Tesco said Catteau, the French retail chain it acquired in May, had
increased sales by 7 per cent so far this year, in spite of the difficult
French economic climate.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Wall Street expects bidding war on Paramount
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Paramount Communications soared yesterday as Wall Street
anticipated a bidding war for the entertainment group. This followed a
Dollars 9.5bn (Pounds 6.2bn) hostile offer launched on Monday night by QVC
Network, the home shopping television company headed by Mr Barry Diller, a
leading film industry executive.
Paramount's shares closed at Dollars 77, up Dollars 7 3/8.
QVC's bid topped an agreed bid for Paramount launched on September 12 by
Viacom, a cable television service and programming company best known for
its MTV pop music channel.
Wall Street analysts expected Viacom to improve its offer substantially to
remain in the battle and they thought other US media groups might enter the
fray.
Viacom said acidly that the 'marriage of strategic assets of Paramount and
Viacom cannot be matched by the combination of Paramount and a shopping
service'.
However, QVC's bid was helped yesterday - the first opportunity for the
market to express a view on its offer - by the fact that after a morning dip
its shares ended the day slightly higher. The stock closed up Dollars 1/8 at
Dollars 56 1/8 on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. That meant that its
bid, consisting of Dollars 30 in cash and 0.893 of a share for each
Paramount share, was worth Dollars 80, the same price as when it was
launched.
Viacom's offer of Dollars 9.10 in cash and a mixture of its stock was worth
only Dollars 60.55, with Viacom's A shares falling Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars
56 3/4 and its B shares down Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 50 7/8. That gave the
offer an overall value of Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.7bn) compared with Dollars
8.2bn at launch.
However, Mr Diller has a strong reputation in the entertainment industry.
Other leading shareholders are Comcast, a large cable service company, and
Liberty Media, a cable programme concern spun off from Tele-Communications,
the largest US cable service company.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Feeling of betrayal in corporate Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Daimler-Benz betrayed the rest of the German corporate sector by
capitulating to the financial imperialism of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission? Many Germans have been shocked by the ailing motor and aerospace
giant's publication last week of two strikingly different versions of its
1993 first-half figures, a German-style net profit of DM168m (Pounds 67m)
and a US-style equivalent net loss of DM949m.
At the last count 557 foreign companies had registered securities with the
SEC so that they could be owned and traded by Americans. But in all this
selection none is from Germany.
However, on October 5 Daimler-Benz is due to list its shares on the New York
Stock Exchange. It will be able to do so because it has agreed to recast its
financial statements in accordance with US generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP).
For the German corporate establishment this has been quite a snub. For many
years the Germans have been fighting a rearguard action to protect their own
financial reporting methods, which are highly conservative and legalistic.
They are at the other end of the spectrum from the judgmental and
potentially more realistic 'true and fair' British accounts ('potentially'
because it is prudent to be modest on the day of the Spring Ram results).
The German view of this was expressed eloquently earlier this month by Mr
Herbert Biener, of the German Federal Ministry of Justice. At the Copenhagen
congress of the European accountants' federation FEE, he said it was an
illusion to believe a German company's accounts would be comparable to those
of a similar US corporation because they were both drawn up under US GAAP:
'the economic, social and legal environment of those enterprises may be so
different'.
But to Mr Walter Schuetze, chief accountant of the SEC, speaking on the same
platform, the issues were self-evident. The role of financial reporting, in
the words of the US Financial Accounting Standards Board, was to provide
'evenhanded, neutral, unbiased information'. In the US system, he said,
'information is king, and also queen'.
To the SEC, the challenge of the international markets is similar to the
challenge it has already faced within US domestic markets over the past 60
years. It has imposed standardised accounting and reporting across different
markets to create a rational basis for investor choice.
The parallel development of financial market theory in the US has focused on
efficiency of markets and the attainment of equilibrium pricing which
supposedly leads to the efficient allocation of capital. Within such a
framework there is much emphasis on the heavy trading of shares within
liquid markets.
The approach, naturally, is eagerly promoted by volume-hungry stockbrokers
and by investment banks living off deals which depend on shareholders being
only loosely and temporarily attached to the companies in which they invest.
In the late 1980s the system went badly wrong and clearly led to the
inefficient allocation of capital through a series of wildly mispriced deals
and financial collapses but the American investment banking establishment
has now recovered its nerve.
German attitudes have traditionally been quite different. The theory that
speculative trading could direct capital in an economically desirable
direction is dismissed as a road leading straight to Polly Peck. Company
accounts are not there to define some unattainable 'truth' but to achieve
the more modest aim of fulfilling legal and fiscal obligations. There is an
emphasis on long-term or 'core' shareholders, including the big banks, and
there is not seen to be anything wrong if they are given more accurate and
up-to-date information than are other investors.
For many years the Germans have been able to claim that their approach gave
superior results. It supported long-termism in industry and suppressed the
financial wheeler-dealers who thrive in an Anglo-American culture. But now
the German economy faces its biggest crisis since World War Two.
Daimler-Benz, the nation's biggest industrial company, has decided it must
gain access to the global capital market.
To Deutschland GmbH this seems like treachery. The implications for the
introverted governance of the German corporate sector could be profound. But
only the very strong can write their own rules.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Historic cruise helps to soften up canal rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER Ship Canal's minority shareholders yesterday agreed to sell their
stock to Peel Holdings for: Pounds 23 a share, a Pounds 7 loan note, a
cruise down the canal next year - and a commemorative medal showing Queen
Victoria making a similar trip in 1894.
The deal values the ship canal company at nearly Pounds 240m.
Peel, a Rochdale property company chaired by Mr John Whittaker, already owns
82 per cent of the stock. Mr Whittaker's private interests won control in
1987, after a bitter two-year fight, in a bid then valuing the company at
Pounds 37m.
A handful of resistant shareholders, who inherited their ship canal shares
as family heirlooms, were overwhelmingly defeated at a general meeting at
Manchester's Free Trade Hall. They will be allowed to keep their share
certificates for sentimental reasons.
Under the deal, all shares will have to be sold to Peel, which will absorb
the canal company, ending its quotation on the Stock Exchange 99 years after
the waterway opened. The same price will be paid for both ordinary and
preference shares.
The original offer valued the ordinaries at Pounds 7 and the prefs at Pounds
3. The bulk of the latter are already owned by Peel. Since they have equal
voting rights with the ordinaries, they provided a cheap way to gain
control. The rest are held mainly by Mr Nicholas Berry, the largest ordinary
minority shareholder, who was defending chairman of the company in the last
months of the battle.
Since the company has statutory powers, the High Court has to approve the
deal. The court required a simple majority of shareholders and 75 per cent
majority by value of holdings - criteria which were easily achieved
yesterday.
The Pounds 7 loan stock, to be redeemed for Pounds 10.50 in five years'
time, represents the potential value of 300 acres of land which Peel hopes
to develop as a retail centre, in spite of legal obstacles it has yet to
surmount.
Mr Berry said shareholders' patience had been rewarded. He criticised
financial institutions which had sold earlier to Peel for short-termism and
being run by 'grey men'.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Tesco to fight rivals on price: 'Aspirations of customers in
the 1990s are very different from the affluent 1980s'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO, the UK's second-biggest superstore chain, yesterday broke ranks with
its main competitors by saying it was repositioning itself on price, and
admitting the growing threat posed by discount food retailers.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, claimed Tesco had opened a price gap of 4 to 5
per cent on basic products between it and competitors such as J Sainsbury
and Argyll, owner of Safeway. His comments prompted speculation about a
price war.
He admitted Tesco had been slow to react to the recession, but hoped to
outpace its competitors in a grocery sector where 'the ball-game has
changed'.
'Quite clearly the aspirations of customers in the 1990s are very different
from the affluent 1980s,' Sir Ian said.
He added that the spread of discounters such as Aldi, of Germany, and Netto,
of Denmark, selling a limited range of goods at low prices, had put pressure
on superstores to ensure their prices were competitive.
'Whoever you are, you now have the Aldis, Nettos and Eds sitting on your car
park. We have got to be as cheap as anybody on the basics, but offer
additional lines and services.'
His comments came as Tesco disclosed a smaller-than-expected increase of 3.4
per cent in interim profits to Pounds 261.5m on turnover up 9.5 per cent to
Pounds 4bn. It said its gross margin was down 0.2 percentage points as a
result of its price initiatives - the first decline for about eight years.
Sir Ian did not go as far as Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, who
has warned the 'halcyon days' of food retailing are over, with a saturated
food market unable to support the planned number of store openings. He did,
however, warn there would be an inevitable 'sort-out'.
Analysts said Tesco's new approach, which follows similar moves by
superstore operators such as Asda, Gateway, and Wm Morrison, would put
pressure on Sainsbury and Safeway.
'If you go down this path you must be prepared to go all the way,' said Mr
Bill Currie, analyst at BZW. 'And I don't really see how Sainsbury and
Safeway can sit back and not respond.'
Sir Ian said the change in thinking at Tesco resulted from a review of
customer attitudes. The survey led to a new store design, including new
services and departments. It also led to the decision to sharpen prices and
introduce the cut-price Tesco Value brand to compete directly with the
discounters. Mr David Reid, finance director, denied that discounters had
eroded Tesco's sales, but admitted they were 'changing the price
benchmarks'.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Tarmac in the black and makes cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, Britain's biggest housebuilder, yesterday launched a Pounds 215m
rights issue to fund the next phase of its recovery. It also announced a
return to pre-tax profits in the first half.
One third of the rights issue proceeds have been earmarked to fund a land
buying programme to take advantage of the upturn in the UK housing market.
The rest of the Pounds 215m will cover deferred capital expenditure on plant
and machinery for Tarmac America, and help the group to expand its
international construction business. It will also strengthen Tarmac's
capital structure, including the redemption of Dollars 150m (Pounds 97.4m)
redeemable preference shares.
The one-for-four rights issue is priced at 120p-a-share. Yesterday the share
price closed 1 1/2 p lower at 145p.
Tarmac reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m in the six months to June 30
compared with a loss of Pounds 15.1m in the first half of 1992. Turnover
slipped 4 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn, but sales of continuing businesses rose
2 per cent.
After taxation, minority interests and preference dividends, the group
recorded a loss per share of 0.7p, against a 2.2p loss last time. The
interim dividend is maintained at 3p.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, said Tarmac was nearing the end of its
remedial phase and the management was now turning its attention to the next
stage.
'Today's rights issue is the final piece of the jigsaw for our remedial
strategy and the foundation stone of our strategy going forward,' he said.
'The rights issue will enable us to achieve our medium-term objectives for
growth whilst maintaining prudent financial policies,' he said.
In the first half, net interest costs fell to Pounds 24m, from Pounds 31.9m,
reflecting lower rates and a sharp decline in net borrowings. The group's
divestment programme has so far raised Pounds 227m towards a target of
Pounds 300m.
Overall operating profits increased by 69 per cent to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds
14.7m). The housing recovery and improved prices in quarry products,
together with the benefits resulting from Tarmac's rationalisation and
refocused strategy, all contributed to the improved performance. Exceptional
items added another Pounds 1.7m to profits, against Pounds 2.1m last time.
Within the group's three core businesses, turnover in the quarry products
division increased to Pounds 260.3m (Pounds 240.7m), but operating profits
fell to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 8.7m), reflecting a change in product mix. The
housing division more than doubled its operating profits to Pounds 15.3m
(Pounds 7m), even though turnover declined to Pounds 255.5m (Pounds 281.9m).
But profits fell to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 9.3m) in the construction division
despite an increase in turnover to Pounds 480.9m (Pounds 448.5m).
The rights issue is fully underwritten by Lazard Brothers and Samuel
Montagu.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Ministers see savings in drive against housing benefit fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING BENEFIT fraud is to be the main focus of government plans to save up
to Pounds 1bn next year by preventing false social security payments.
Ministers hope to be able to announce the detailed measures in time for the
Tory party conference due to take place early next month.
The move is likely to be announced by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security
secretary, who will be keen to find a statement popular with the party,
given the anger among grassroots Tories that no scheme has yet been
announced for compensating those worst affected by the imposition of value
added tax on domestic fuel.
Housing benefit is administered by local authorities, and among the probable
changes is a reform of the complicated arrangements through which councils
are repaid by government for what they spend, to give them a greater
incentive to cut down on fraud.
Better systems under which central government can keep a check on how
authorities are running the benefit are also likely.
Until now, Whitehall officials say, the emphasis has been strongest on
tackling fraud in benefits administered by central government, and the
greatest savings in these areas may already have been made.
A report from the Audit Commission, a government-spending watchdog, said
early this year that it welcomed moves already taken to reduce the
disincentive for councils to mount fraud investigations and improve housing
benefit administration. However it added that more should be done.
A group of officials from the interested departments have been carrying out
a review of housing benefit for some months, as part of the long-term review
of public spending.
Ministers in the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social
Security have concluded, however, that they can do little to cut housing
benefit rates without undermining the government's social housing policy.
Instead, in the public spending discussions with the Treasury, they are
offering to make the savings necessary from an anti-fraud initiative.
One official said that discussions were still going on, but housing benefit
would probably alter to put the onus on local authorities to track down
fraudsters.

FT  22 SEP 93 / US stands ground on farm pact: Statement as France renews
threats to veto Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, DAVID BUCHAN and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday released its strongest statement so far refusing to
renegotiate the US-EC farm trade pact, agreed last November at Blair House
in Washington.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said: 'Interpretation or
clarification of Blair House cannot be a guise for modifying the terms of
the agreement.' The pact had been only 'minimally acceptable to the US and
to the EC's other trading partners'; it resulted from 'a difficult
compromise which the US accepted in its entirety'.
Mr Kantor said his plan to meet Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner and
chief trade negotiator, next Monday predated the EC's council meeting.
'Reopening the Blair House agreement will not be on our agenda.' France
meanwhile renewed threats to veto a Gatt farm deal unless it obtained fresh
concessions, but claimed victory over getting the EC to reopen farm trade
talks with the US.
Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, expressed satisfaction that
the final communique of the Brussels meeting reflected France's 'essential
principles'.
Those were that any farm accord with the US should not go against, or
beyond, the EC's internal reforms, while it should still allow EC farmers
preference on their home market and an export role abroad.
Mr Balladur cautioned that 'everything is not settled, for all that'.
Confirming his role as France's 'hard man' on the Gatt farm issue, Mr Alain
Juppe, who is secretary-general of the RPR Gaullist party as well as foreign
minister, brandished the veto threat again.
There was mixed reaction from France's 1m farmers. Leaders of the mainstream
FNSEA and CNJA unions welcomed the Brussels outcome as a modest first step,
but said they still did not trust Sir Leon to put their demands to the
Americans and would prefer France to talk directly to the US.
Coordination Rurale called for 'vigilance' among its members, who tried to
blockade Paris last week, while two leftwing farm groups - Confederation
Paysanne and Modef - denounced the conservative Balladur government for its
'capitulation' in Brussels.
Praising the co-operation Germany had given him on the farm issue, Mr
Balladur went on to criticise 'certain European partners' for claiming that
'France was putting the community in danger'. That appeared to refer to
British warnings to France not to precipitate an EC crisis over Gatt.
Sir Leon brushed aside the French threats. He said the internal EC
compromise over Blair House - agreed about 3am yesterday - had 'cleared the
air', leaving no excuse for other leading trading partners to delay new Gatt
offers and push the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion.
Sir Leon also emphasised the unanimous agreement of all 35 EC foreign, farm
and trade ministers in the final communique that December 15 was a serious
deadline, countering recent French suggestions that the date had been
imposed by the US.
Under the compromise, Sir Leon's brief is to explore whether the US is
willing to show new flexibility in 'interpreting, amplifying or clarifying'
parts of Blair House, without, however, requesting a formal renegotiation of
the EC-US agreement.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Coal to be split up for sell-off: Government decision goes
against management wishes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is to be offered for sale as five regional businesses, contrary
to the wishes of its management, which wanted to keep it together.
Announcing preliminary details of the privatisation yesterday, Mr Tim Eggar,
energy minister, said that structure was most likely to attract buyers. But
he emphasised that a purchaser could bid for any number of parcels, so
British Coal could still be sold in one piece.
'We want to give purchasers the opportunity to decide the best way to
purchase these assets,' he said.
A privatisation bill will be put to the next parliamentary session so that
the sale can be made by early summer 1994.
The five regions into which British Coal will be divided for the sale will
be Scotland, Wales, the north-east and the central coalfield, which will be
divided into two parts based on Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.
The businesses will be offered to trade buyers, but government finance is
also available to help management and employees put together buy-out teams.
All bids will be assessed 'on their merits', Mr Eggar said, although he
declined to specify the criteria the government would use.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, said: 'It will be interesting to
see, following their assessment of the business and the various risks
involved, whether prospective purchasers will be seeking combinations of
sale packages when they submit offers to the government.'
Mr Eggar said he had already received expressions of interest reaching into
'double figures'. Several small and medium-sized UK mining companies
confirmed that they would be bidding. 'This structure is just what we
wanted,' said Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining.
Trade unions are also preparing bids. The UDM, the breakaway miners' union,
said it was working on a bid together with East Midlands Electricity and an
unnamed foreign partner.
A threat to the sale emerged yesterday, however, when Nacods, the mining
supervisors' union, was allowed by the courts to challenge a radical
overhaul of health and safety regulations, which is essential to
privatisation. Nacods said Mr Justice Popplewell, a High Court judge, had
granted leave for a judicial review because the reforms might conflict with
the health and safety law principle that changes must not lead to a
deterioration in safety rules.
The reforms, which have already been enacted and are due to take effect on
October 1, abolish the function of deputy, the supervisory workers
represented by Nacods. They also replace some statutes with codes of
practice and give mine managers more discretion over applying safety rules.
Mr Peter McNestry, leader of Nacods, said: 'We think we have an arguable
case and we can prove it to the benefit of everyone working in the industry.
These changes are not as good as the present regulations.'
British Coal said it would have to go ahead and implement the changes,
although they would not be ready by October 1 in certain pits.

FT  22 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One has to hope that Paramount's attraction does not turn out to be fatal.
QVC Network's emergence as a rival suitor to Viacom comes as no surprise.
But the price it is offering, at something approaching 20 times this year's
cash-flow, looks an almost indecent proposal. It is easy to see why such
companies are seduced by the idea of owning a studio. Paramount's
film-making skills cannot easily be duplicated. There is nothing similar on
the market. Yet conventional wisdom dictates that anyone who aspires to
success in the global media business must have the capacity to originate
entertainment.
The temptation for predators to lose sight of real value is all the greater
when they can pay with overvalued currency in the form of their own common
stock. Viacom's offer is already worth a lot less than the original Dollars
8.2bn. QVC's shares also look vulnerable. Perhaps the willingness of such
companies to splash their paper about is a sign that equity prices really
have reached fantasy levels. Certainly they would be much less inclined to
largesse if they were having to stump up real money.
That will not stop the Paramount story turning into a long-running epic.
Viacom may offer a better strategic fit than QVC, but it will have to
increase the cash element of its bid, currently Dollars 9.10 compared with
QVC's Dollars 30, to remain in the running. Even then others may enter the
fray. It would be rash, though, to count on a foreign bidder sailing in with
a ship load of cash. Growing protectionism in the media business on both
sides of the Atlantic makes such a raid fraught with danger.

FT  22 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's three-quarter point cut in interest rates suggests the Bank of
Japan was distinctly under-whelmed by the latest economic package from
government. Whether taking another slice off interest rates will do any more
than last week's modest fiscal stimulus to halt the slide in the real
economy remains open to question. If savings rates are reduced in line with
the discount rate, cash should - in theory - be squeezed out into
consumption. But there has been scant evidence of that effect in the three
years since interest rates started to fall. With talk of job cuts starting
to circulate among recession-hit Japanese companies, consumers may feel less
like spending than ever.
There may be more chance of reversing the trend of asset price deflation,
especially in property. As in the US, that, combined with a steeply sloping
yield curve, would help restore the position of the banks. But the US
experience underlines that healthy banks are necessary but not a sufficient
condition for recovery. While domestic demand is weak and exporters are
priced out of overseas markets by the strength of the yen, there are few
reasons for optimism. The faint weakness of the Japanese currency yesterday
is a minor consolation.

FT  22 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That Tarmac needed a rights issue was the City's worst kept secret.
Write-offs and the strain of paying an uncovered dividend for the last two
years - and probably again this year - have reduced shareholders' funds by
one-third from the peak reached in 1990. The auction market preferred shares
which are now to be redeemed are an expensive and unreliable form of
funding. Replacing them with real equity makes sense, although the Pounds
20m cost of unwinding related interest rate swaps underlines what a poor
decision it was to issue in the first place.
The worry is that the Pounds 75m earmarked for investment in land is barely
enough to sustain Tarmac's momentum in house building. At an average plot
cost of Pounds 13,500, an annual investment of Pounds 100m will be required
to maintain the land bank given the planned level of house sales. Having run
down land stocks to release cash during recession, Tarmac could no longer
afford to sit back and wait. But other housebuilders are already well
advanced in the process of replenishing stocks. Land prices are rising
faster than house prices. Tarmac may need all its expertise as a low-cost
builder in order to maintain margins.
Where the cash for investment in house building will come from thereafter is
also unclear. The disposals programme is coming to an end. On the basis of
yesterday's figures, contracting cannot be relied upon to generate much by
way of cash before the middle of the decade. Aggregates offer more immediate
hope if prices recover and capital expenditure remains low. But buying
Tarmac for the prospect of dividend growth looks a forlorn hope.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The whiff of grapeshot rose from Tesco's interim figures yesterday. A
decline in gross margins - the first for nearly a decade - is the skirmish
with live ammunition which marks the end of the phoney price war. Tesco is
taking sales from the other superstore operators at a rate which none of
them can ignore. They will have to respond to the 'value line' initiative
with cheap own label goods, and the struggle seems likely to escalate. While
Asda and Gateway were quietly folding in on themselves, the big three could
rely on easy market share gains. Now Asda is on its way back. Gateway has
been ring-fenced from its debts, while the discount presence is growing and
leading grocers still chant the mystical mantra of expansion until the end
of the decade.
With ever-expanding capacity in an almost fixed-volume business, something
clearly has to give. Yet the horrendous costs of quitting and high fixed
overheads of superstores force the grocers to run them for cash. That
effectively means there is almost no limit to the margin erosion which could
occur if the grocers descended into a game of competitive devaluation.
The market has, of course, already priced much of the risk of a limited
engagement. It has not, however, come to terms with the possibility of an
all-out war. In terms of its market value, almost all of the Pounds 572m
raised in Tesco's 1991 rights issue has now gone up in smoke. At the time it
was expected to make Pounds 660m in 1992, yet it will struggle to earn
Pounds 600m in the current year. Meanwhile managements continue to whistle a
happy tune and think a happy thought as the gravy train runs out of steam.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Brains without power: John Major's politics only partly
explain the decline of UK think-tanks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Think-tanks in Britain were never going to have it so good under Mr John
Major as they did under his predecessor, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - at least
not those of the right-of-centre variety.
Mrs Thatcher was a founder of the free-market Centre for Policy Studies;
would invite early advocates of privatisation from the Adam Smith Institute
to weekend seminars at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence; and
would read Institute of Economic Affairs pamphlets in bed.
But under a prime minister elected Tory leader partly because he was less
ideologically driven than Mrs Thatcher, the role of think-tanks in
influencing government policymaking has receded.
Mr Andrew Tyrie, a director of the Social Market Foundation, founded by
members of the defunct Social Democratic party, says the change of leader
explains the think-tanks' 'collapse of influence. They played a crucial role
in forming the consensus that put markets first. It's only natural that they
are less important now,' he says.
But attributing the decline of think-tanks solely to Mr Major's more
pragmatic political philosophy is misleading.
Their difficulties have been compounded by the Conservative Central Office's
Pounds 19m deficit, which is expected to lead to cuts in the budgets of its
two internal research wings, the Conservative Research Department and the
Conservative Political Centre.
At the same time, Tory rifts over the Maastricht treaty have spread beyond
parliament. At the Institute of Economic Affairs, the split over Mr Major's
European policy led to the defection of its director, Mr Graham Mather, last
year to set up the European Policy Forum.
The declining importance of think-tanks in Whitehall policymaking has not
dissuaded people such as Mr Mather from setting up rival institutions in an
attempt to provide the 1990s with a post-Thatcherite agenda.
The Social Market Foundation, which tries to link market economics with
social policy, was set up in 1988 but relaunched last year with finance from
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of the retail supermarket chain. Earlier this
year, Mr Martin Jacques, former editor of Marxism Today, and Mr Geoff
Mulgan, former assistant to Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor,
launched Demos, a non-party-political but left-leaning research centre.
To thrive, the new institutions will have to learn the lessons of the 1980s.
Mr John Gray, the Oxford fellow who has been closely involved with both the
IEA and the Centre for Policy Studies, and is now on the board of the SMF,
believes rightwing think-tanks became too dogmatic - promulgating
'Thatcherism on autopilot'.
'There was a hubristic element to policymaking. With the poll tax,
considerations of social equity were unimportant and it got to the stage
where only policies, not society, mattered,' Mr Gray says.
But will the think-tanks regain the influence they once had under the
Conservatives? Arguments over the Tories' main targets for reform - trade
unions, nationalised industries, health and education services - have mostly
been fought and won. And, unlike in Germany, France and the US, there is
little movement of people between government and think-tanks, which would
have offered a better guarantee that their impact would not be diluted when
political leaders changed.
In France, ministers' private offices often include representatives of
independent think-tanks, while in Germany, the Stiftung Wissenschaft und
Politik, the international affairs think-tank in Ebenhausen, does contract
work for the government.
In the US, think-tanks offer life after government for deposed politicians.
'There will always be a market for think-tanks in the US because politicians
now join them when out of office: the Brookings Institution for Democrats,
the American Enterprise Institute for Republicans,' says Professor Nick Wahl
of New York University.
In contrast, Mrs Thatcher took a deliberate decision that private
think-tanks should be kept at arm's length from government. In 1982 she
rejected proposals to merge the Number 10 Policy Unit (set up by Mr Harold
Wilson when he was Labour prime minister in 1974) with the Central Policy
Review Staff, created by Mr Edward Heath, the Tory prime minister, in 1970,
as an independent source of advice for Downing Street.
Merger would have bought a permanent foothold in Whitehall for the non-civil
servant advisers at the CPRS. Mrs Thatcher regarded the CPRS as too
institutionalised and abolished it the following year. 'As time went by it
(the CPRS) concerned itself less and less with central issues and became a
meddler in departmental business,' says Sir Douglas Wass, a former permanent
secretary to the Treasury.
Mrs Thatcher's decision had little impact during the heyday of the rightwing
think-tanks that lasted until the mid-1980s. But in the 1990s think-tanks
have found themselves on the political periphery.
'Think-tanks have established their place in the sun. We're semi-detached
observers who do useful work and provide ideas,' says Mr Mather. 'But it's
not with the same red-blooded vigour as under Mrs Thatcher.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Privatising British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STATE-OWNERSHIP of Britain's coal industry has been a dismal business. For
much of the period since nationalisation in 1946, British Coal has become a
byword for strikes, poor investment and anachronistic working practices.
Taxpayers and electricity consumers should therefore heave a sigh of relief
that the government is finally pressing ahead with privatising the industry
with a sale planned next year.
Privatisation is also the industry's best chance of surviving in the long
run. British Coal's high costs relative to imported coal and other sources
of energy have contributed to a sharp decline in its market, with the result
that the company is now dying on its feet. An industry which had 1,500 pits
and employed three quarters of a million people on nationalisation is now
down to 30 pits and 33,000 employees. When privatised, it will have shrunk
again to perhaps half its current size. Any hope for stemming yet further
decline rests on improving productivity on a scale faster than state-owned
British Coal has been able to achieve.
Ministers have adopted a flexible approach to determine the structure of a
privatised industry. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, announced yesterday
that pits would be offered for sale in five regional packages but that
groups would be able to bid for any number of packages. This approach will
allow the market to decide the industry's structure and the government to
realise the highest value for public assets.
Slash overheads
Another benefit is that lively entrepreneurs, for whom the whole of British
Coal might have been too much to swallow, will be able to take part.
Management and employee teams will also be able to propose buy-outs. Such
talent may be just what the coal industry needs. Those who risk their own
money will have the greatest incentive to slash overheads, devise more
efficient working practices and seek out new markets.
Leaving the market to decide structure also neatly sidesteps conflicting
competition arguments over whether the industry should be broken up prior to
privatisation. One view, influenced by the problems that resulted from
privatising British Gas and British Telecommunications as monopolies, is
that a large number of competing coal companies would deliver lower prices.
A rival view is that the generating duopoly of National Power and PowerGen
would find it easy to dictate terms to a fragmented industry, so British
Coal should be privatised as a single entity.
Best way
Neither competition argument is compelling. British Coal is unlike the
utilities in that it has to compete with foreign coal and other fuels.
Privatising it as a single entity would therefore not substantially reduce
competition. On the other hand, though the generators' duopoly power is
certainly a cause for concern, the best way of dealing with this would be to
tackle that power directly rather than build up British Coal as a
counterweight. Mr Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity, is
already pursuing this possibility.
Nevertheless, there are many details ministers will need to determine before
privatisation. How will British Coal's contracts with the generators be
split up between successor companies? Who will assume its liabilities and
what arrangements will be made to compensate redundant workers in the
future? How will the government's scheme to subsidise extra coal sales
operate? Who will control the coal industry's Pounds 13bn in pension assets?
Most important, how big an industry will be privatised?
Mr Eggar was studiously vague on this final question yesterday, raising
concerns that the government will try to find some backdoor way of keeping
more pits open than the market can support. Dud mines might be packaged with
viable pits or private buyers might be asked to give guarantees not to close
mines for so many years after privatisation.
It is certainly possible to put such an interpretation on Mr Eggar's
reticence. But the more likely explanation is that ministers know that
further pit closures are inevitable before privatisation but were so badly
burnt by last year's pit crisis that they cannot bring themselves to admit
it.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Yeltsin's gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THIS year the Russian political situation has recalled that of 1917.
There is a general feeling of anarchy, and there are ostensibly two centres
of power: the government of President Boris Yeltsin, and the parliament. But
there is no Lenin. Mr Yeltsin is a shrewd if erratic political fighter, and
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, is a cunning tactician.
Neither has Lenin's capacity for strategic thought, nor probably his
ruthlessness, nor even his total contempt for formal democracy. Neither, so
far, has been willing to invoke the final argument of physical force.
The army, even though as much confused, divided and demoralised as the rest
of the population, has not disintegrated as it did in 1917. Its leaders
rightly regard civil war as the outcome to be avoided at any cost, and in
that too they are representative of the population at large. Russia has so
far conspicuously avoided the mass violence that afflicts so many of its
southern neighbours. The terrible sequel of 1917 is burnt very deep into its
folk memory.
This context gives a certain unreality to the constitutional struggle.
Parliament and president confront each other, but neither controls very
much, and neither is willing to use bloodshed to achieve its ends. Thus
previous crises have proved anticlimactic. The army has intervened in the
corridors rather than in the streets. Half-baked compromises have been
reached, and the opponents have continued to circle each other.
More serious
This time things look more serious. There have been reports of troop
movements, and 'special government telephones' in the parliament building
have been cut off. Mr Yeltsin has not had his opponents arrested in their
beds, nor has he cut off all their communications, as would the author of a
true coup d'etat. But he does seem to have taken steps to prevent parliament
directly usurping, or confiscating, his authority in response to his
decision to dissolve it. He has probably assured himself of the loyalty of
key army units in the vicinity of Moscow - enough, at least, to ensure that
Mr Alexander Rutskoi's claim to replace him is as inconsequential as was his
own deposition of Mr Rutskoi from the vice-presidency some weeks ago.
Whether either act is constitutional is a question not so much moot as
meaningless. There is effectively no constitution, and cannot be until prior
questions of legitimacy are settled. Mr Yeltsin hopes to clarify the
question by holding new parliamentary elections. He could and should have
done so two years ago, at a time when his popularity following the defeat of
the August coup would have made it much easier for him to dissolve
parliament, and would have ensured the election of a majority pledged to
support him. But by early this year, when he first canvassed that solution,
he was not strong enough to impose it. It is far from certain that he is so
now.
Popular mandate
Even if he succeeds, a new parliament will not now solve his problems.
Although probably less conservative than the present one it might be no less
recalcitrant, and it would have the legitimacy of a fresh popular mandate,
which Mr Yeltsin himself can no longer claim. It would be much better if the
constitutional distribution of powers were clearly settled before the
election, but who has the authority to do that? Perhaps only an elected
constituent assembly. If so, the only way to square the circle may be for Mr
Yeltsin to decree an interim constitution, and then submit himself for
re-election simultaneously with the election of a new parliament with an
explicit mandate to draft a permanent one, to be ratified finally through a
referendum.
The west's interest in all this is to see the consolidation of democracy in
Russia through the continuation of economic reform. The reform will not
succeed if democracy is discarded, but it may also fail if too much
attention is paid to constitutional niceties in a country that still lacks
the social and cultural bases of constitutional rule.
The west's instinct will be to support Mr Yeltsin so long as he respects
fundamental freedoms and appears decisively committed to pushing reform
through. In recent months there has been more doubt about the latter than
the former.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Between a rock and a hard place: Fiscal policy alone may not
be enough to revive the French economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the finance committee in the French National
Assembly, puts it simply. 'If you are trying to lift a heavy rock, then you
need to use both hands.'
The rock, for Mr Barrot and his countrymen, is the longest recession to
afflict their economy since the 1970s. With unemployment at 11.7 per cent
and rising, and with gross domestic product forecast to contract by almost 1
per cent this year, it is a heavy burden.
The stakes are high. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has described
the fight against unemployment as the government's top priority. With
presidential elections just 18 months away, the fortunes of Mr Balladur's
RPR party and its UDF coalition partner will depend on how the
administration wields its fiscal and monetary tools, and whether they act
fast enough for the French electorate.
The government will declare its fiscal hand when it unveils its 1994 budget
in cabinet today. Acknowledging that he initially erred too far on the side
of austerity in this year's budget, Mr Balladur has struck a median course
for the future, using the proceeds of privatisation and related borrowing to
finance tax cuts and consumption incentives within a tight limit on overall
public spending.
But how the government will use its monetary powers is less clear. After
losing its bearings in the August crisis of the European currency system,
the French government is still groping its way towards a new European
policy.
Today's budget plan demonstrates the government's desire to stimulate demand
in the economy, but also the constraints it faces in doing so. The principal
elements of the budget comprise a FFr19bn (Pounds 2.2bn) reduction in income
taxes, chiefly to the benefit of the ruling conservatives' middle-class
constituency, and a number of measures aimed at drawing French savings into
housing and consumption.
In particular, the government is expected to allow savers to withdraw early
from eight-year saving plans while maintaining the tax advantages and
interest payments of the schemes. Tax relief on Sicav money market funds may
also be reduced in an attempt to encourage consumption and investment in the
housing sector. Those selling money market fund certificates to buy property
could be exempted from capital gains tax.
Such measures alone do not represent a significant fiscal stimulus. This is
partly because the government is now giving with one hand what it took away
through tax increases earlier this year. The rise in the Contribution
Socialisee Generale, a tax on all income, from 1.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent
from the beginning of July, and higher levies on petrol and alcohol, will
not be offset by the budgetary measures.
'We have to maintain the health of public finances,' says one French
economic official, referring to the tax measures in the budget. He cites the
government's budget deficit targets of FFr317bn this year and FFr300bn next
year as the constraints on the package.
Instead, the real fiscal boost is coming from borrowing. The proceeds of the
Balladur Bond, raising FFr110bn in July and covered by privatisation sales
of the same amount over the next 18 months, will help to fund public works
and housing and to improve companies' cash flow.
One measure hit its target. The decision to accelerate infrastructure
spending in May gave public contractors, intensive users of local labour but
little imported material, a better month in June. But overall, the economy
has not lifted itself off the floor. GDP recovered from its first-quarter
fall of 0.7 per cent to show zero growth in April-June.
But a 'double dip', with a drop in GDP in the current third quarter, is not
ruled out by most economists, who believe that fiscal policy alone is not
enough to lift the economy out of recession. 'They must add a monetary
stimulus to their fiscal stance,' says Mr Paul Chertkow, currency economist
at UBS, the securities house, in London.
On monetary policy, however, 'there is a fog surrounding policy', says Mr
Barrot, 'and when there is a fog it is necessary to move step by step'. So
far, these steps have involved a series of gradual interest rate cuts and a
policy of shadowing the D-Mark. But the reductions in borrowing costs have
only brought official interest rates down to pre-crisis levels and the most
important rate, the intervention rate, which sets a floor for money market
rates, has been left untouched at 6.75 per cent. As a result the franc is
now trading just a few per cent below its previous ERM floor rate of
FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark.
This caution is curious, given that on August 2 it was France that insisted
EC currencies should be allowed to fluctuate by up to 15 per cent around
each other, not by 10 per cent as other countries were ready to agree to.
But there are several reasons why the French authorities have not so far
used their exchange rate freedom.
To do so would highlight the loss of face for Mr Balladur, who portrayed
himself as defender of the franc fort. The RPR Gaullist prime minister also
has to take account of the atavistic attachment within his UDF coalition
partner to the old-style European Monetary System. Ex-president Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, a founding father of the EMS and leader of the UDF, has
called for the EMS to return to its old 'wide' bands of 6 per cent by
January 1994 and its old 'narrow' bands of 2.25 per cent by January 1995.
Technically, too, the Bank of France needs to rebuild its currency reserves
 -exhausted by the unsuccessful defence of the franc - and to repay its
consequent debts to the Bundesbank: tasks most cheaply accomplished if the
franc stays fairly strong relative to the D-Mark.
The government's problem is that its policy of shadowing the D-Mark is
reaching its limits. 'There is no room left any more for French rates to
decrease with respect to German rates,' says Mr Bernard Godement, chief
economist at Nomura Research Institute in Paris.
According to this argument, the current gap between short-term French and
German interest rates - about 50 basis points higher for French official
rates - is necessary to maintain the franc's stability. Further cuts in
French rates, therefore, require further action from the Bundesbank. Few
expect big cuts in German borrowing costs over the next few months.
Yet early action to trim French interest rates, with the inevitable risk for
the exchange rate, may be unavoidable. In nominal terms, French long-term
interest rates, at just over 6 per cent, are among the lowest in Europe and
about the same level as in Germany. But their real level is high. With
annualised inflation of just 2.2 per cent, French industry faces
correspondingly higher real borrowing costs than Germany's.
Small and medium-sized companies, which are more dependent on short-term
financing, are worst placed, and are starting to make the politicians feel
the heat. 'There is not a small company in the country which can find credit
at less than 9 per cent,' complained a UDF deputy this week. Moreover, the
currency markets appear to have anticipated a reduction of a few percentage
points in the intervention rate by this time next year.
Given that the high level of French interest rates at a time of recession
and soaring unemployment helped prompt the currency crisis, keeping interest
rates at their current level could lead to a fresh assault on the franc.
It also seems to be dawning on France's policymakers, just as the markets
earlier realised, that 'real' factors of growth and jobs need to be as much
part of the convergence between European economies as the 'nominal' factors
like interest rate/inflation differentials, written into the Maastricht
treaty. The first sign of this wider interpretation of convergence may come
later this autumn when France and Germany make a joint presentation of their
medium-term economic plans for discussion with other EC ministers.
For the moment, the debate inside France's ruling majority over interest and
exchange rate policy has subsided. But that is because those who want a
monetary relaxation expect Mr Balladur to move in their direction. If he
does not, both the prime minister and the French economy may find themselves
between a rock and a hard place.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was quite reasonable to assume, when Spain's Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez decided to remove Carlos Solchaga as finance minister and give him
the far more important job of chief whip of a divided socialist
parliamentary party, that the Solchaga team at the finance ministry would
have to find other jobs as well.
What has been a surprise is how reluctant any of them has been to leave the
secure embrace of the public sector - perhaps they know something about the
Spanish economy that no one else does.
Claudio Aranzadi, former industry minister and Solchaga acolyte, has been
parcelled off for an unstressful few years as Spain's representative to the
OECD in Paris. JJ Ruiz, the former assistant economy secretary, is now head
of research with Argentaria, the pool of state owned banks.
Jaime Gaiteiro, former chief of the revenue service, is now running the
national mint, while Antonio Zabalza, the former finance secretary, is chief
of staff in the prime minister's office.
But Pedro Perez, Solchaga's amiable deputy, has been waiting for something
to come up since the June election. Yesterday Perez, an enthusiastic smoker,
was named chairman of Tabacalera, the state-owned tobacco monopoly.
Solchaga, whose reach remains long despite his absence from Cabinet, has
done his boys proud.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Observer: Berlin game
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While Manchester was quaintly presenting assorted Irish guards and Gurkhas
as the 'best of British' at Monte Carlo yesterday, Daimler-Benz boss, Edzard
Reuter, who has masterminded the Berlin 2000 Olympics bid, again came up
trumps. He wheeled in Steffi Graf and Franz Beckenbauer, and also made sure
of a fleet of Mercedes limousines for the International Olympic Committee.
Reuter has stayed at a very active epicentre of the roughly DM250m German
campaign. In recent months, Daimler-Benz provided IOC members with lavish
hospitality at the Stuttgart world athletic championships, while it chipped
in a donation to the Olympic museum in Lausanne. Reuter obligingly whistled
up the Berlin Philharmonic for the latter's opening ceremony.
Reuter also boasts a close personal relationship with IOC president, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, once even defending the former Franco supporter as 'an
upright democratic man'.
'Berlin is a strong contender,' Samaranch said recently, adding, perhaps
superfluously, that as president he does not vote. But then nor did the
Catalan vote when the Olympic Games went to his home town of Barcelona. Now
that Reuter sees his own birthplace in the frame, how comforting for him to
know that Samaranch understands his sentiments.

Appearances notwithstanding, John Major's Japanese visit has not been
concerned purely with the state of the British Conservative party. He also
found time to axe the Commonwealth Institute.
One can see why the Foreign and Commonwealth Office waited for the green
light from Tokyo before announcing yesterday that its annual grant to the
Institute (currently worth Pounds 2.7m) will cease from March 1996. Only
last May, the Queen was there celebrating the centenary of its opening and
next month Major will accompany her to the biennial Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Cyprus.
Normally the institute rates a paragraph of ritual congratulation for its
work towards the end of the CHOGM communique. This time the PM had better
expect some awkward questions.
The FCO explains piously that it cannot provide the increased funding
recommended in a recent review by Lord Armstrong. 'We hope the institute
will not regard the decision as tantamount to closure,' says the FCO. At
present it raises not even 20 per cent from sponsorship and commercial
activities. The government apparently hopes that 'other members of the
Commonwealth will fill the funding gap'. Hard to see why they should, if
Britain's contribution after 1996 is to be precisely zero.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Good to see that Nicholas Berry, son of Lord Hartwell, bail surety for Ian
Maxwell and former owner of Harrap, knows how to spend his extra pennies
wisely.
Berry stands to make Pounds 20m from the deal he, with other minority
shareholders, has carved in the sale of his piece of Manchester Ship Canal.
So he plans to set up a foundation 'for improving people's skills in
thinking' with a portion of the proceeds.
'People concentrate too much on destroying the arguments of others. They
don't differentiate opinion from fact and don't use the other person's case
to find new solutions to old problems,' he says.
The deal came out of a bout of sustained thinking - if not a little arguing
 -by Berry, who had been at loggerheads with yesterday's buyer, property
developer Peel Holdings, and its chairman John Whittaker, since he lost
control of the ship canal in 1987. Now, obviously thanks to his lateral
thinking, Berry has cut the gordian knot to come up with a partly paid deal
that gives Peel the necessary room for manoeuvre.
The foundation is a suitable bequest from Old Etonian Berry, who has never
harboured doubts as to the pedigree of his brain. When asked earlier this
year if he had employed a headhunter when bringing Lord Gowrie onto the
board of Yeoman Investment Trust, which he chairs, Berry explained:'I have a
perfectly good head myself.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Default less likely with clearing
house agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOSEPH ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While your Risk and Reward column of September 13 ('Divisions hazy in
OTC derivatives clearing debate') was as usual both timely and informative,
some flawed and spurious logic has apparently crept in.
The article refers to the risks relating to bank deposit guarantee schemes.
Similarly it suggests, in a clearing house agreement, 'low-rated banks could
be given excessively large credit lines by other banks because they know
they do not have to worry about credit'. This shows either a lack of
understanding of how clearing houses work or naivety over how important
credit risk is to clearing members.
For the argument to make any sense one must assume that clearing houses
and/or clearing member firms are unconcerned with the creditworthiness of
their members and customers. This is highly unlikely, given that the raison
d'etre of a clearing house is to centralise credit risk in one entity that
intensely scrutinises and works to minimise the likelihood of counterparty
defaults.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Africa's lunatic asylum: US ends in Somalia are admirable,
but do not justify the means
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The UK gov-ernment said last night its forces would fire on civilians being
used by IRA gunmen as 'human shields', des-pite casualties among women and
children on Thursday when British helicopters fired into a crowd.'
Just imagine the worldwide outcry that would greet that news item. Imagine,
especially, the storm of indignation that would sweep across the US. It
would surely end, once and for all, any talk of a 'special relationship'
between the UK and the US.
Now read the item again, substituting 'United Nations' for 'UK government'
and 'Somali militiamen' for 'IRA gunmen'. I did not make it up. It was the
opening sentence of a report from the FT's Africa correspondent, published
10 days ago.
I tried this trick on several US officials and commentators in Washington
and New York last week. Needless to say, they did not like the analogy, but
they floundered somewhat in trying to explain what was wrong with it.
'But in Northern Ireland you'd be killing your own people, your kith and
kin,' said one. 'Aha,' I replied, 'so is it perhaps their skin colour that
makes Somali women and children expendable? If so, won't black American
leaders soon have something to say about it?'
Apparently not. Black leaders were to the fore in urging the US to go in and
save Somalis from starvation, complaining that the UN had become exclusively
obsessed with a 'white man's war' in Yugoslavia. Therefore, I was told, they
are not well placed to call for a pull-out now.
War and 'warlordism' - disrupting the production and distribution of food -
were the main causes of famine in Somalia. Everyone seems to agree about
that. That is why armed intervention was deemed necessary to end the famine.
The first UN force (Unosom I), dispatched in August 1992 to supervise and
protect food deliveries, failed to overawe the warlords. So in December a
stronger force (Unitaf) was sent in, authorised by the UN Security Council
but under US command.
Initially the US wanted to concentrate only on food deliveries. It was the
UN secretary-general, Boutros Boutros Ghali, who insisted that the warlords
must be disarmed at the same time if the operation was to have any lasting
effect.
By the time the US command handed over to the second UN force (Unosom II) in
May, the US had come round fully to Mr Boutros Ghali's view. In fact the US
view now seems to be that all remaining problems in Somalia are the fault of
one particular warlord, General Mohammed Farah Aideed.
'On food, we have done very well,' said US defence secretary Les Aspin on
August 27. 'On security, we have made progress.' Somalia, he said, is now
'generally peaceful', except for south Mogadishu, the Aideed stronghold.
'The danger now is that unless we return security to south Mogadishu,
political chaos will follow the UN withdrawal . . . The danger is that the
situation will return to what existed before the US sent in the troops.'
The US retains two separate forces in Somalia. There are logistics troops,
which are part of Unosom II and under its commander (who is a Turkish
general, but chosen for the job by the chairman of the US joint chiefs of
staff, General Colin Powell); and there is the 'quick reaction force' (QRF),
composed of combat troops which remain under US command but back up the UN
force when necessary, at the request of the UN special representative (who
is another American, Admiral Jonathan Howe). It is the QRF which retaliates
when UN troops are ambushed or fired on by General Aideed's forces, and
which, therefore, has inflicted most of the casualties on Somali civilians.
This complex command structure results from the unwillingness of the US to
do what every other contributor to UN forces has to do, namely place its
combat troops under a commander of another nationality. Presidential
Decision 13, which is supposed to define the availability of US forces for
UN peacekeeping and other duties, has been held up by prolonged argument
within the administration on this very point.
In the case of Bosnia, President Bill Clinton has insisted that if US troops
do go in to help enforce a peace agreement they will do so under Nato and
not UN command. (His aides say it is agreed within Nato that the French
General, Jean Cot, who commands the present UN force in Bosnia, would also
command the Nato troops; but it remains to be seen whether Mr Clinton is
really prepared to try and sell that arrangement to Congress.) Meanwhile,
the arrangements in Somalia ensure that the UN is identified, in the eyes of
local opinion and of the world, with a peculiarly American modus operandi.
Somalia is not another Vietnam, or even another Panama; still less another
Gulf war. It is like a grotesque re-enactment of all those by the inmates of
a small lunatic asylum (on the lines of the French revolution as portrayed
in Peter Weiss's play Marat-Sade). The objectives are admirable, and in this
case untainted by any discernible US national interest. But several hallowed
American principles are at stake:
The battle is one of good against evil, and evil has to be incarnate in one
man (Gaddafi, Noriega, Saddam and now Aideed).
US casualties must be as low as possible, but US military superiority must
make itself felt, no matter how great the 'collateral damage'.
Any attempt at a negotiated solution constitutes 'appeasement', if not
'betrayal'.
Whoever questions the method is assumed to be urging abandonment of the
entire enterprise.

FT  22 SEP 93 / MacGregor gets show on the road: Charging for UK road use
has attracted support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, published proposals in
the spring to charge motorists for using Britain's motorways, many
Conservative backbenchers thought a public relations disaster was in the
making. Like rail privatisation and talk of cuts in pension provision, the
plan seemed set to alienate Tory supporters and add further to the
government's unpopularity.
Yet now that the consultation period on the green paper has ended, Mr
MacGregor appears to have won unexpected support for his proposals.
The Confederation of British Industry, the Freight Transport Association and
motorists' organisations have all accepted the principle of motorway charges
 -though with differing degrees of enthusiasm.
The CBI has reversed its previous opposition to road charging, even though
it estimates that motorway tolls would add as much as Pounds 300m a year to
business costs. This would be outweighed by the benefits of reduced
congestion and easier access to customers and suppliers, the CBI believes.
The Freight Transport Association, representing 12,000 companies in the
freight transport and distribution business, says it is prepared to accept
motorway charging as the only way of raising sufficient finance for
improving the motorway and trunk road network.
'We're prepared to put our money where our mouth is,' says the association's
Mr John Gutteridge.
Even the two large motoring organisations, the Automobile Association and
the RAC, accept the case for charging. Both acknowledge the opposition of
their 13m members to paying motorway tolls, but say they will not oppose
charging provided it is examined in the context of all motoring taxation.
The RAC suggests that a reduction in other motoring taxes such as vehicle
excise duty could ease the initial impact of road charging and win
acceptance.
All the organisations prepared to comply with motorway charging do so
largely because they accept the premise of the government's green paper that
the public purse is not deep enough to build the new road capacity needed to
accommodate the doubling of traffic by 2025.
This argument has encouraged other countries to adopt forms of road charging
to fund new roads and reduce congestion, as Mr MacGregor has discovered in
recent overseas trips. In May he visited Norway and Sweden to look at
experiments in urban road pricing and last week he visited the US to look at
several toll road projects.
If any nation could be expected to resist the introduction of paying for
roads it should be the US, where cheap motoring and the 'car culture' are
deeply embedded. Even the terminology the Americans use to describe their
highways - freeways - suggests an unrestricted and uncosted freedom to
drive. Yet Mr MacGregor found a surprising willingness to accept tolling in
response to increasing congestion on suburban freeways and pressures on
trunk road budgets.
At Harris county in Texas, which includes Houston, he saw two toll roads
built by the county after residents voted seven to three in favour of tolls.
One, the Hardy Toll Road, links the airport to the town centre; the other,
the Sam Houston Tollway, is part of an outer city ring-road.
The Federal Highway Administration in Washington, which is responsible for
45,000 miles of interstate highways, is also encouraging toll road
construction.
'It is the only way to speed up our road-building programme,' commented Mr
Gary Maring, head of the transport studies division.
Federal, state and local authorities currently spend Dollars 83bn a year on
road building and maintenance, funded largely through an 11.5 cent tax on a
gallon of petrol. 'But we found these resources didn't meet our needs,' said
Mr Maring.
Pressure on revenues prompted legislation in 1987, allowing demonstration
toll programmes in seven states. In 1991 this was extended to allow all
states to charge tolls on new or reconstructed roads and bridges.
'We see toll roads as a supplemental finance mechanism and not as a
replacement for the basic idea of funding road building through fuel tax,'
said Mr Maring.
Increasingly, electronic tolling is used globally to collect road charges.
In Harris county, tolls were initially collected at manned and automatic
toll booths but the county is now moving to electronic tolling.
Motorists carry an electronic tag on their windscreen. This is read as the
vehicle passes through the toll plaza and the driver's bank account or
charge card is automatically debited. Up to 1,800 vehicles an hour can pass
through the electronic toll gates compared with just 350 when an attendant
collects the money.
Motorists have been encouraged to sign up for Houston's tag system by a
reduction in the standard toll from Dollars 1 to 75 cents, explained Mr
Chuck Reedstrom, revenues manager of the Harris County Toll Road Authority.
Some 17,000 motorists are now registered for electronic tolling and new
subscribers are signing up at the rate of 1,000 a month.
Mr MacGregor's preference is for some form of electronic charging system for
UK motorways. 'It is fairly clear that in the long run tolling has to be
electronic,' he said during the US trip.
He will find support for this view when he and officials come to read the
responses to his green paper on motorway charging. A strong advantage of
electronic charging, according to these submissions, is that charges can
vary with time and place of use to relieve congestion and encourage off-peak
journeys.
However, the necessary technology for electronic tolling across the UK
motorway system would take some time to install. To bridge the gap until
then, Mr MacGregor has suggested a system of motorway permits, similar to
the vignette system in Switzerland that requires motorway users to display
an annual permit bought from post offices or petrol stations.
The bad news for Mr MacGregor is that there appears to be little support for
a permit system as an interim step. Responses to his green paper say that it
would be expensive to administer and difficult to enforce. They also point
out that the cost bears no relation to use - indeed, permits might encourage
motorists to increase their use of motorways to get the most from the cost.
There is also concern that tolls should supplement rather than replace
existing Treasury finance for road-building and maintenance. The CBI, the
Freight Transport Association and the motoring organisations all insist that
toll revenues should be spent on improving the motorway and trunk road
network, and that this money should be additional to the Pounds 1.7bn a year
the government currently spends.
Mr MacGregor may find that clearing this hurdle is somewhat harder than
winning support for the principle of motorway charging. The Treasury has
long been implacably opposed to the idea that any form of government revenue
should be 'hypothecated' to particular types of expenditure. It is also
unwilling to guarantee any particular level of finance beyond the current
public expenditure plans.
However, persuading the Treasury to overcome its traditional stance on these
issues may be the only way of keeping the public support for motorway
charging that Mr MacGregor has succeeded in establishing.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was disturbed to read that Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings,
blames the low inflationary environment for making it difficult for him to
increase prices ('Markets aground on a reef of cautious results', September
20). Isn't that the whole idea?
Are we not trying to build a stronger economy by forcing businesses to
achieve profit growth through improvements in productivity, quality and
design? Has the strategy of trying to raise your prices faster than everyone
else not been likened to a dog chasing its tail enough times for people to
see it for the fraud that it is?
Let lower inflation give Mr Rudd confidence to invest in the future by being
able to budget for costs with greater certainty, and let his businesses
succeed through value added from investments in training and technology. The
ridiculous situation of raising prices to combat rising prices must not be
allowed to return.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fallacy of common-market exchange
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALAN WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professors Eichengreen and Wyplosz emphasise that 'if Europe fails to
restore exchange rate stability it will fail to complete the single market'
(Personal View, September 17). I do not know whether the common market will
ever be 'completed', but it is perfectly clear that exchange rate stability,
whatever that means, is not even a necessary, let alone sufficient,
condition for a common market.
From 1601 to 1844 England and Scotland enjoyed a common market, even
economic union, yet the exchange rate of the various Scottish currencies
fluctuated freely against the pound sterling.
And today in North America, between Canada and the US, there is a close
approximation to the ideal of a common market, soon to be 'completed', yet
there is no fixed or pegged Canadian dollar to the greenback, nor has anyone
suggested that the North American Free Trade Agreement requires pegged rates
or a Namu (North American Monetary Union). Nor does the lack of stability of
the Canadian dollar seem to have inhibited economic integration within North
America. Canadian-US trade flows are the largest in the world.
It is odd that Eichengreen and Wyplosz, in pursuit of a common market,
propose to put taxes on capital movements within that market in order to
defend pegged nominal exchange rates. Is the common market to be 'completed'
by tariffs on capital?

FT  22 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Accounts must be given real meaning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P C LE MESURIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article (Accountancy Column, September 16) claiming that the
Accounting Standards Board may be going in the wrong direction in trying to
put more meaning back into the balance sheet, Mr Ron Paterson of Ernst &amp;
Young makes the curious statement: 'At best, accounts can be expected to
present only a rather stylised model of a company's financial affairs.'
How on earth can this possibly be squared with the Companies Act requirement
that auditors assure shareholders that the balance sheet gives a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of a company?
Shareholders are entitled to expect that balance sheets do present such a
view. If, in fact, the auditors regard such reports as merely a coded
statement of something quite different, which they expect shareholders to
understand, it is little wonder that a so-called 'expectations gap' has
developed. The puzzle is why Mr Paterson is not suggesting that the format
for the auditor's report be changed to state what he appears to believe,
namely: 'In our opinion, the accounts give a stylised model of the company's
financial affairs which, at best, may be true and fair.'
It seems to me that the Accounting Standards Board should be encouraged to
continue its efforts with the aim of converting balance sheets into
documents which can genuinely be regarded as giving the shareholders a
proper view of the state of affairs of companies, while at the same time
ensuring that profit and loss accounts give shareholders a proper view of
the profits. Mr Paterson's article seems to imply that the two are
incompatible which cannot possibly be the case.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARGARET ANSTEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Like your correspondent, Philip Whiteley (Letters, September 14), and
as a future neighbour of the Bolivian naval base at Tiquina on Lake
Titicaca, I, too, enjoyed Christina Lamb's dispatch ('The Navy lark',
September 11/12).
Some variations on the story behind Queen Victoria's demand that Bolivia be
expunged from British maps are even more curious than that recounted by Mr
Whiteley. The reason for the British ambassador being ignominiously removed
from La Paz, tied backwards on a donkey, is said to have been his refusal to
accede to President Malgarejo's insistence that the diplomatic corps drink
from the same bowl as his favourite horse, Holofernes, which regularly
attended the bibulous banquets frequently offered at the palace.
Queen Victoria's initial reaction is alleged to have been 'send in the
navy'. It was on being told that Bolivia was a landlocked country that she
changed the punishment to deletion from the map.
As I pointed out in my book, 'Gate of the Sun', however, this must be an
apocryphal story since Bolivia had not then lost its coastline, an event
that happened a few years later.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Arts: 'Bohemian Lights' reopens the Gate - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many another, I love the Gate Theatre, and my love is mixed with both
gratitude and wonder. Gratitude, because no single theatre has done more to
extend my ken of world drama. Wonder, because it is tiny and stages its
marvels on a shoestring without being able to pay its performers. Imagine,
those of you who have not ventured there, what it is to climb upstairs above
a Notting Hill pub and to discover a real masterpiece - a masterpiece of
which you had not even heard - of modernist/Romantic/baroque/Renaissance
drama, vividly performed. Yes, riches in an upper room; blessed poverty.
Now, after some months' closure, it is slightly less poky. Even the stairs
seem wider. The foyer has been enlarged, and is now a handsome deep crimson;
and the auditorium (where the stage used to be) has wider rows, seating 132
instead of 56, while the stage (where the audience used to be) is better
equipped; and I am told stage and audience areas are reversible. Backstage,
technical and box-office facilities are all said to be improved; and air
conditioning has been installed. Not all is yet perfect; on press night
offstage noise was more audible than before. But an invaluable theatre has
been altogether strengthened.
The Gate keeps extending our range by extending its own. It re-opens with a
season of 20th-century world theatre, and first with Ramon Maria del
Valle-Inclan's 1924 play Bohemian Lights. Though plays by Valle-Inclan have
been performed in London before, he is still scarcely known here. In Spain,
however, a white scarf is draped around his statue in Madrid each year; and
he really must be good, because the press release says that Michael
Billington calls him 'the most pioneering Spanish dramatist of this
century'. But . . .
Unfortunately, poor Valle-Inclan (d. 1936) here has been elbowed out of the
way by translator David Johnston and designer Richard Hudson - who both seem
to insist 'I am the ballerina of this show.' The play is a grotesque
post-Goya vision of the Madrid he knew, torn by civil disturbance, as
reimagined by a blind and drunk poet on the last night of his life.
Johnston, however, has transferred it firmly into the Ireland of 1915 - so
firmly that it is often impossible to tell what the Spanish original could
have been like.
I can take (say) Phedre translated into the India of the British Raj,
because it is easy to find the more traditional Phedre. Valle-Inclan, by
contrast, is a rare bird in this country; and the folk who have just
introduced me to his work have made him out to be an alternative James Joyce
writing on a highly specific view of Dublin.
Yet the real virtuoso turn is Richard Hudson's set, which has neither Madrid
nor Dublin on its mind. It has windows within doors, cupboards within doors,
doors within doors; it has trapdoors, and a grave; and what its ceiling does
in Act Two nearly gets a round of applause. Its rectangular proscenium area
is skewed at an angle of 20 degrees; it has a raised midground, and a lower
rear area; plus an ascending curtain. It is also covered with handwritten
prose which not infrequently distracts from the play. Too bad they did not
give it a curtain-call of its own; it probably could have done a dance.
The director, the usually exemplary Lawrence Boswell (artistic director of
the Gate), must take blame for these two over-clever top-layers.
Nonetheless, he honours Johnston's Irish version, and fleshes it out with a
cast of 18. Bohemian Lights, when you can concentrate on it (mainly in the
final hour), is full of irony about its protagonist: he is a blind man who
is all vision, a drunkard who is a poet, a family man who roams the streets.
In a final blaze, he talks of distorting the traditional classical vision in
a hall of mirrors - by looking at the world through the bottom of a glass
tankard.
But his drunkenness here, and his vision, become so specifically Irish, and
the play becomes so much about the troubles of Dublin in 1915 - with Yeats
present as a character, and people referring to Parnell and Ulster - that we
lose track of Valle-Inclan's intention and get caught up instead in the
politics and sociology of Ireland. Most of the acting, led by Tony Rohr and
Ray Callaghan as the poet and his croney, is excellent; but much of the
speaking is too loud. The intensity of delivery does not lead us into the
play, but creates another barrier between it and us.
At the Gate, W11, until October 23

Jeremy Mills, producer of the BBC1 documentary series 'The Skipper' screened
last night, is also the producer of today's Inside Story which looks at
Terry Waite's five years as a hostage in Beirut. During Waite's time in
captivity there was growing speculation about his relationship with Oliver
North, the man at the centre of the American 'arms for hostages' deals, and
talk of a rift between Waite and the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Waite describes the experience of being held hostage and talks about
subsequent resulting difficulties (9.30 BBC1).
A new season of BBC2's 'ScreenPlay' begins with Love Lies Bleeding, set in
Belfast. A republican prisoner, Conn, held in the Maze, is let out on parole
for 24 hours and attempts to establish who killed his girlfriend many years
ago (9.00).
Tempting music on Radio 3. The BBC Orchestras at 7.30 begins with a live
performance by the BBC Philharmonic of Sibelius's tone poem 'The Swan Of
Tuonela'. Then at 9.45 in the Bath International Festival a positive feast
of real music by Bach, Handel and Telemann.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Arts: Secondhand soap loses its froth - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As actors grow old they convince themselves that less is more; that the
pinnacle of acting is the portrayal of the simpleton. Peter Sellers was, by
all accounts, obsessed with the idea of playing the featherbrained gardener
in Being There, his last major film, and now we hear that Alec Guinness was
dead keen to play the part of the mentally damaged Amos in Roy Clarke's
'Screen One' drama on BBC1, A Foreign Field. At the age of 79 Guinness took
on the part of a man with the mind of an eight-year-old, having just five
words to say (so we are told; I must have missed most of them) and was
finally able to try his hand at emulating his hero, Buster Keaton. Of course
Keaton was silent of necessity, having become a film star before they
invented talkies. It is very different, and surely a little perverse, to
revel in the eschewal of language once it is available to you. As you might
expect, Guinness was pretty impressive in the role, but it is sentimental
and dishonest to pretend that there is something mystically enriching about
being a dumb septuagenarian. For the audience, watching an actor playing an
old man without the aid of dialogue may be a little more interesting than
watching a drama school exercise in minimalism with students obliged to 'be
a table', but not much.
*****
By the time this column appears in print, perhaps Nigel Short will actually
have triumphed over Gary Kasparov and won his first game. Let us hope so,
for the sake of Channel 4's World Chess series which is becoming more and
more embarrassing. Even in the earliest stages, before it began to look
ominously like a Kasparov walkover, the programme felt a bit hyped. Though
there were only three people in the studio, including the presenter; there
seemed to be too many experts; and the desperate desire to talk up a storm
resulted too often in a babel of voices. Presenter Carol Vorderman's
technique is to ask a girlish question and then, just before we get to the
point of the answer, butt in with a girlish comment or a new girlish
question. Apart from those late night 'animal watch' programmes where the
presenters try to obscure the tedium of somnolent rodents by pouring out a
stream of hushed burbling commentary, World Chess is proving just about the
most irritating programme on television.
*****
The chip-on-the-shoulder view within the Murdoch mass media empire is that
Murdoch television networks and newspapers attract endless sneering because
the old English public school establishment is deeply snobbish and turns up
its nose at Rupert Murdoch whom it sees as a jumped up colonial with more
money than taste. Gosh, the Murdoch adjutants keep telling us, he's a great
businessman who never, well hardly ever, interferes with editorial content.
He phones up often enough to talk about marketing or the competition, but
never dictates leader policy, what more could you ask? You could ask that he
did take a bit of interest in the content. How much more admirable and
inspiring if, faced with a lack of success at The Times, instead of turning
to a marketing mechanism and lopping a third off the cover price, Murdoch
were to declare that they would improve the editorial content to such an
extent that it would outsell all competitors on merit. How exciting if,
instead of the Murdoch satellite television channels being hyped so absurdly
in the Murdoch press, Mr Murdoch himself were to say 'We're one of the
world's richest mass media conglomerates, so we'll stop filling our channels
with all this secondhand Australian and American rubbish and invest money in
the origination of high quality comedy, documentaries, drama, wildlife
programmes, music and arts.'
*****
Not that the satellite is the only place where you find Australian and
American rubbish. Switching off a tape at lunchtime on Monday, I found
myself watching Neighbours on BBC1; Australian, of course. ITV was
simultaneously screening another Australian soap: Home And Away. BBC2? An
Australian cookery programme, presented by a man of abnormally repellent
tone and manner. Meanwhile Channel 4 was showing Bobobobs, a half-hour
American cartoon show. Last week, according to the BARB figures, these four
terrestrial channels took 93.2 per cent of the audience with all the
satellite and cable channels managing only 6.8 per cent between them. But if
the terrestrial channels are going to force us, like their satellite
competitors, to choose between secondhand Australian and secondhand American
programmes, with not a single home produced programme on the air, it is
going to be difficult to defend them against the worst excesses of the
market place.
*****
There have been transatlantic format deals which worked: Till Death Us Do
Part and Steptoe And Son went west and became highly popular in the US as
All In The Family and Sanford And Son. ITV's current series The Upper Hand
in which Joe McGann plays a sort of au pair to a shoulder padded
businesswoman is an example of the process travelling east, and quite a lot
of viewers seem to like it. But, so far, ITV's Brighton Belles has been a
disaster. It might, perhaps, seem less dreadful to somebody who had never
seen The Golden Girls, but anybody who became fond of the American original
on Channel 4 must surely find this wan English copy desperately difficult to
watch. Sheila Gish, Sheila Hancock, Jean Boht and Wendy Craig are good
enough actresses (though it seems ludicrous to ask Boht, who looks about 55,
to play the mother of Hancock who looks about 57) but they simply are not
the wise-cracking ball breakers for whom the original ideas were created. It
is bad enough to rely for laughs on such awkwardly contrived lines as 'I'm
as jumpy as a virgin in a tentful of Boy Scouts', but catastrophic to cap
that with the line 'That's pretty jumpy'. It seems clear from the nervous
over-manipulation of the laughter track that the producers are keenly aware
of their difficulties.
*****
However, while The Golden Girls may have been highly successful in its
eastward move, the same cannot be said for C4's American Football; not so
far as this viewer is concerned, anyway. Having previously sampled it,
recorded my boredom, and been assured by enthusiasts that it is a splendid
spectator sport once you really get into it, I tried again with The Big
Match. It still looks tediously static, with ground usually being gained at
about the speed of a self-advancing pit prop. Moreover the players still
look like a lot of strutting cissies with their absurd Tweedledum padding,
and the unceasing Gatling gun commentary is unendurable. Hurling, on the
other hand, as brought to us by C4 in Gaelic Games seems to be a
breathtakingly exciting sport which is wickedly under-reported on
television. Perhaps the All-Ireland final between Galway and Kilkenny was an
unrepresentatively magnificent match, but it was one of the fastest and most
spectacular sporting occasions I have ever seen. There seem to be few rules:
you can throw and catch the ball, kick it, run with it, toss it up and whack
it with your stick, score goals in the net or points by getting the ball
over the uprights above, and the ball moves from one end of the pitch to the
other in seconds. Tackling is rough and nobody goes whining to the referee
if, as frequently happens, a stick comes down inadvertently upon a head.
Hurling makes American football look like something invented for
kindergartens: television should bring us much more hurling, and not after
midnight.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Arts: Ballet music reborn - Clement Crisp recommends some
new recordings of old favourites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Whatever the excellence of his other works, Tchaikovsky never surpassed The
Sleeping Beauty.' So writes Roland John Wiley in his magisterial study of
the composer's three ballet-scores.
It is a statement calculated to give pause to devotees of the operas and
symphonies, but a study of Beauty's music will show with what theatrical
power and melodic prodigality Tchaikovsky transformed a genre that had
previously been un-considered and unimportant. With him, and with Delibes
and Lalo and Glazunov, music for dancing became glorious in the 19th
century. Beauty's score, indeed, transcends the theatre, presenting us with
a metaphor as potent as classical dancing itself for a formal elegance that
is an ideal of noble behaviour. Listening to the music, and watching
Petipa's choreography - in a responsible production - we see the apotheosis
of 19th century ballet. The fruit of a courtly society attendant upon the
absolute monarchy of Tsar Alexander III, paying homage to the earlier
absolutism of Louis XIV, Beauty is a supreme example of the aristocratic
principle in art.
A new issue of the complete Beauty comes from the orchestra of the Mariinsky
Theatre where the ballet had its first performance in 1890. ('Very nice' was
the Tsar's depressing comment to Tchaikovsky at the repetition generale, and
the composer noted this with five exclamation marks in his diary). The
performance is issued by Philips on 3 CDs: 434 923/4/5 - 2, with the
curiously named Kirov Orchestra, St. Petersburg conducted by Valery Gergiev.
It is an interpretation which must claim our attention: it has a stylistic
authority given by players who understand the music's traditions in the
theatre of its birth.
The text is complete. Small cuts are fascinatingly opened in Aurora's last
act variation, in the entree of the grand pas de deux, and a significant
passage is restored at the end of Act 2, when the spell of sleep has been
lifted and the court awakens. This should be imposed upon every production:
the usual helter-skelter closing of the scene - 'He's kissed her; she's
awake; let's get on to the last act, pronto, then we shan't have to pay the
orchestra over-time' - is an insult to Tchaikovsky, to Petipa, to the
dancers, and the audience. Any truncating of this score, any jiggery-pokery
by producers - and there have been truly despicable stagings in recent
times- destroy the grace of Tchaikovsky's structure, which is clear to
perceive as you listen to the ballet in its entirety, or watch it in the
Mariinsky Theatre.
With the Mariinsky orchestra much of the playing is beautiful - the
symphonic interlude when the prince journeys to the castle is fine indeed -
and there is implicit in every number an understanding of the music's life
on stage, in tempo and dramatic feeling. Only the Prince's last act solo is
taken at an unsuitable speed. I found Gergiev's handling of the score
sympathetic. A few passages are somewhat deliberate - the Vision scene
dances short on fantasy - but this is in the main a valuable issue.
I do not understand, though, why Philips should produce so unworthy a
booklet to accompany it. John Warrack's English-language commentary is
excellent, but the French note has its curious moments, and the
illustrations are provocatively bad. The cover photograph is a fuzzy shot of
two dancers rehearsing, wearing practice dress and ectoplasm, while the CD
cover boasts a dull snap of an awkwardly posed danseuse, a negation of
everything Beauty means in the theatre. Tchaikovsky is shown to us as he was
in 1868 (so helpful), and there is an unidentified picture of the Mariinsky
Theatre. Nothing relates with any sense to Beauty, nor to its traditions in
Petersburg.
Another important but too-often ignored dance score of the period is Edouard
Lalo's Namouna. It is irresistible music, first heard at the Paris Opera in
1882, when it was staged by Marius Petipa's elder brother, Lucien, a notable
dancer but less known as a choreographer. Namouna's plot was a thin incident
about a young lord who gambles away his favourite slave to another nobleman,
and its interest lay in the potential for local colour of its setting on
Corfu. Given the enfeebled state of French ballet by the 1880s, it is small
wonder that the ballet did not survive, but the score has always had its
aficionados.
That it is still known is partly due to Serge Lifar, who made his Suite en
blanc for the Paris Opera dancers during the dark days of the German
Occupation. He used Lalo's own two orchestral suites from the ballet, and we
can still see Suite en blanc today, an exhilarating blaze of plotless
virtuosity, buoyed up on the score's driving rhythms and piquant, witty
melodies. A new recording of Namouna (Valois: V 4677) comes from
Valois/Musique Francaise/ Biennale de Lyon, a collection dedicated to the
promotion of French music from 1790-1950. The performance is by the
Orchestra Philharmonique de Monte Carlo under David Robertson, and the disc
comprises Lalo's two orchestral suites (the numbers positioned in their
proper order in the full score) and four additional items, with the opening
of a large cut in the delicious 'Valse de la cigarette'. (Namouna rolled and
smoked a cigarette on stage at this moment. Gasps from the stalls.)
It is music I adore, for its vivid sonorities, its charm, and its
adventurousness, and it is very respectably performed. A comparison with
Jean Martinon's 1971 recording of the suites with the Orchestre National de
l'ORTF, shows him marginally lighter in touch, but this is an interpretation
that everywhere respects Lalo's music. I cannot admire the turgid programme
notes provided: why cannot record companies give us well-written - and
well-illustrated - booklets?
As a look back to an earlier manner of ballet music, Richard Bonynge and the
English Chamber Orchestra offer a two CD recording (Decca: 439.286-2) of Le
Corsaire as it was given at the Paris Opera in 1867. Forget almost
everything you might have heard in the Kirov Ballet's version of this merry
old romp: that score is a ratatouille owed to at least five composers. This
issue offers an editing of the ballet's original (1856) text by Adolphe
Adam, with the addition of Delibes' mellifluous Pas des fleurs. Adam's
writing is eloquent, speaking the theatrical language of his time with a lot
of charm. Delibes' contribution is pretty as can be: we can already hear the
genius that was to give us the miracles of Coppelia and Sylvia. The whole
thing is something of a curiosity, but Bonynge loves such music, and it is
fetchingly done. There are excellent programme notes from Ivor Guest. But
why does Decca not provide illustrations of Corsaire, and let the listener
see something of the theatrical marvels that made, and continue to make,
this dear old ballet so popular?

FT  22 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: How green is my superstore? -
Shopping can be a waste of energy

<TEXT>
The concept of 'environmental architecture' has invaded architectural and
development offices around the US, although developers, architects and
environmentalists disagree over what the term really means. To some, the
concept involves buildings which use recycled materials and contain
energy-saving features. To others, it has far more to do with a building's
location.
Wal-Mart, one of the largest retail groups in the US, has somehow landed at
the centre of the debate. A few months ago, the successful discount chain
opened a new store, dubbed the Eco-Mart, in Lawrence, Kansas.
The store incorporated a number of innovative ideas, including an
air-conditioning system which uses no CFC-based refrigerants, a solar-lit
sign at the entrance, an environmental education centre and a community
recycling centre. Even the car-park was paved with recycled asphalt.
Not all environmentalists are convinced that the Eco-Mart is a positive
trend. Activists in the state of Vermont, for example, are opposing the
construction of Wal-Marts on the outskirts of two communities on the grounds
that their very presence is anti-environmental.
At the heart of the controversy is environmentalists' fear that the new
stores will add to city sprawl and increase Vermonters' dependence on their
cars.
'It does no good to call a building 'energy-efficient' if people have to
expend a lot of energy to get there,' says Gerald Tarrant, the lawyer for
the citizens group opposing the construction of the Wal-Mart in the town of
Williston.
Some ecologists, however, laud Wal-Mart's decision to build an
environmentally sensitive prototype. 'We would prefer to see the Wal-Marts
located on other sites, but you can't just throw up your hands and say you
don't want to work with any groups which locate outside city centres,' says
Meredith Miller, senior programme manager at the Center for Resource
Management, an environmental group which advised Wal-Mart on the project.
'At least it's a step in the right direction. They set an example for other
retailers to follow.'
The Wal-Mart chain is bearing the brunt of growing frustration at the rapid
multiplication of shopping malls in the US.
'Environmentalists have been slow to pick up on the issue of sprawl, but
they are beginning to realise this is fundamental to the preservation of
natural areas,' says Stephen Young, Vermont state representative for the
National Audubon Society, the environmental advocacy group. 'The best friend
to the countryside is a strong, dense city or village centre.'
The debate is especially acrimonious because it calls into question the
suburban way of life in America. Suburb-to-suburb commuting and shopping is
a growing phenomenon. Since most public transport has been planned solely to
move people to and from town centres, rather than between suburbs, these
commuters are forced to rely on automobiles.
Some architects are seeking to change these patterns with new
'village-style' designs, which aim to cut down on automobile use. The
architectural firm Duany &amp; Plater-Zyberk, for instance, has gained fame for
the Florida community of Seaside. The place follows the pattern of a
European-style village, where people live, work and shop, with houses
fitting tightly around a strong retail centre.
Seaside has proved so popular that the firm has designed 70 similar
communities around the country. Duany &amp; Plater-Zyberk says the Seaside model
does
not intend to solve all the problems of city and suburban sprawl.
However, its popularity highlights the growing concern about excessive car
use. With environmentalists stressing the issue, developers, architects,
retailers and restaurant chains may all be forced to pay more attention to
location when they consider ecologically sensitive constructions.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Cleaning up after the Party -
Years of mining lignite have left eastern Germany with a severe pollution
problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody said it was going to be easy. Nobody said it would be cheap.
Everybody agreed it was a mess. Cleaning up eastern Germany after 40 years
of communist rule and, before that, several decades of rapid
industrialisation presents an enormous challenge to the German authorities.
One of the main challenges is healing the damage caused by extensive brown
coal (lignite) mining. Vast areas of landscape were scarred by opencast
mining and the air polluted as the fuel was burned in power plants.
Until 1990, lignite mining affected 1,280 sq km, or 1.2 per cent of the land
area of eastern Germany. These sites, containing a high level of sulphuric
acid, were one of the main sources of eastern Germany's high levels of water
and air pollution.
The enormous range of measures needed to clean up the mess left by mining
and other economic activities in eastern Germany was summed up in the basic
targets set out by Germany's environment ministry in November 1990, a few
months after unification. The paper listed tasks that required immediate
action:
Construction or modernisation of 35 municipal and 24 industrial waste
treatment plants in the Elbe region; and construction of 27 sewage treatment
plants near the Baltic Sea and the Oder and Neisse rivers;
Construction of 6,200 km of new sewers and modernisation of 5,000 km of old
sewers;
Modernisation of 278 outdated plants - including 10 lignite burning power
stations - 142 industrial power stations and 126 heating plants;
Establishment of 10 hazardous waste treatment sites;
Construction of five thermal units for the treatment of contaminated soils.
The extent of these plans shows how damaging an impact industrial, water and
air pollution had on the country as a result of the neglect of the
infrastructure.
Over the years, chemical plants were located around some of the opencast
mines in what are now the states of Brandenburg, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.
The brown coal could then be transported quickly and easily to industry,
which could in turn dump its waste in exhausted pits or huge landfills.
In the process of extracting the brown coal, the engineers strip-mined. The
idea was to pump water out of the soil in order to get at the lignite. The
problem was that once the mines were exhausted, the unchecked water levels
rose. As this happened, the water soaked through layers of sulphuric acid or
through waste dumped by local industry. Once the water reached the surface,
it flowed into the rivers, streams and often the domestic water supplies.
The task now facing the states and the federal government is how to close
down some of the obsolescent lignite mines with the aim of making the
surrounding land fit again for cultivation. Both parties, and the Treuhand,
the agency charged with privatising and restructuring east German industry,
have embarked on a long-term policy which will lead to land reclamation, as
well as short-term job creation. As ever, the problem lies in the cost.
In March, the federal government and the Treuhand put together a financial
package to tackle these issues. The government will provide 60 per cent and
the states 40 per cent of the cost of cleaning up 'local levels of
contamination' or cases which do not endanger life. For the more difficult
and often hazardous projects, such as cleaning up the brown coal and
chemical sectors, the government will provide 75 per cent of the cost and
the states 25 per cent. The total cost, spread over five years, will be at
least DM15bn (Pounds 6bn).
Yet, now that some of the financing has been arranged, Heiner Bonnenberg,
one of the Treuhand's main experts on reclamation, says the costs for
cleaning up eastern Germany are not as high as first estimated. In fact, he
believes they were often distorted, partly so that investors, or their
consultants, could exaggerate the environmental hazards in order to beat
down the Treuhand's selling price.
'Of course, we could not ask the investor to pick up the environmental
liabilities. At that rate, nothing would be privatised,' he says. Yet he and
his colleagues believe that unrealistically high costs of environmental
liabilities were built into the balance sheets.
To prove his point, Bonnenberg says the Treuhand had been allocated DM800m
this year for cleaning up industry, excluding brown coal. 'We have used only
DM200m, partly because the clean-up is not as bad as we thought; and also
the states, which initiate the instructions for the clean-up, have not
actually asked us to press ahead,' he explained.
But it is not as clear-cut as that. On the one hand, the visible effects of
environmental damage have sharply decreased throughout eastern Germany as a
result of the collapse of its industry, so perhaps the sense of urgency has
faded correspondingly among the states.
On the other hand, many states either have difficulties raising their share
of the costs for the clean-up or simply do not have the personnel to
evaluate the extent of the environmental damage.
However this may be, the states have a political interest in land
reclamation. Since many brown coal fields will soon be shut, the
unemployment rate will increase. Before 1989, for instance, the fields of
Laubag in Brandenburg, and Mibrag in Saxony-Anhalt, together employed more
than 100,000 people. By next year, they will employ fewer than 30,000.
To counter the effects of rising unemployment, the federal government has
devised a programme in which former mining employees will be redeployed in
job-creation schemes to gradually shut down the mines.
'Closing a mine is not as easy as you think. It is a very expensive
undertaking,' says Helmut Ballon, one of the senior Treuhand officials
responsible for privatising coal. 'Germany's Mining Inspectorate, which
oversees the running and closure of mines, has very strict regulations for
shutting mines. It is in our interests to meet them. We cannot sell the land
until we have met all the requirements needed to reclaim or recultivate the
land,' he explained.
Inevitably, the cost of reclamation indirectly impinges on the selling price
of mines which will be used for some time yet. Ballon cited the cases of
Laubag and Mibrag: 'For each tonne of coal these mines sell, we must put
some money aside for rehabilitation, otherwise the mines will never be
released from their duties by the Mining Inspectorate. Of course, all
burdens of rehabilitation will be left with us. If we consider the category
of danger to human life, we reckon we will need about DM12bn to cover the
worst environmental aspects of rehabilitating the areas surrounding these
mines.'
During the next five years, the Treuhand will spend DM1.5bn a year to rid
the mines of the most dangerous environmental damage. With the co-operation
of the states, it will employ 15,000 people on this, albeit on lower
incomes.
The scheme has two functions: it will deal as rapidly as possible with the
worst dangers that attend mine closures, such as the rise in the level of
contaminated water; and it will provide temporary employment of up to three
years for each person.
The results of cleaning up contaminated land can be seen in the Ruhr region
in western Germany. Once the heartland of Germany's pre- and post-war
industry, it has been transformed into a services sector and partial tourist
attraction, helped by lakes formed with the water pumped out of the closed
mines.
Officials in Leipzig, the capital of the east German state of Saxony, want
its surroundings to resemble the Ruhr, once the old mines are closed. There
is even talk of Leipzig trying for the Olympic games some time in the next
20 years.

Former Reuter and Financial Times journalist John Makinson is to become
managing director of The Financial Times next spring.
He will be responsible for the production, distribution and marketing of the
paper worldwide and will report to chief executive David Bell who himself
was a journalist on the FT for much of his career.
At the moment, Makinson, who is 38, is one of five partners of Makinson
Cowell, an independent consultancy which advises 23 British companies, all
with capitalisation larger than Pounds 1bn, on their relations with the
financial community. One of its clients is Pearson, owner of the FT.
Makinson admits that the transition back to employee status might be
difficult but says 'it was just such an exciting opportunity,' But, he adds:
'I was not looking for a job; I was approached by David Bell.'
While at the FT, Makinson was approached about a job with a large company
and asked Maurice Saatchi to give him a reference.
Instead, Saatchi appointed him executive vice president of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi's US holding company and he stayed with that company until setting
up his own consultancy in 1989.
Makinson is a graduate in English and History from Cambridge.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Management: Made to measure MBAs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The diversity of the British MBA market will be highlighted today when
ScottishPower and the textile group Dawson International announce a new
management development programme at Heriot-Watt University Business School,
Edinburgh.
Those involved say efforts have been made to design a course which is
relevant to the needs of the two companies. The part-time MBA is also
structured so that the 39 participants can balance study with the demands of
their jobs.
So-called industry-led consortium MBAs are now an established part of the UK
management education scene. Other business schools which offer them include
Warwick (backed by BP Chemicals, North West Thames Regional Health
Authority, National Westminster Bank and British Telecom), the City
University, Lancaster and Henley (though the latter finds companies are now
more interested in its shorter Diploma of Management course).
Consortium MBAs are popular because they enable project work to be carried
out with client companies, as well as reducing the risks to employers of
losing their best managers. Concerns expressed are that companies have too
much influence over the course content, and that control over entry
standards passes from the participating business school.
'In the past many companies have taken a passive view, sponsoring almost
anyone who asked to go on a part-time MBA programme,' says Ian Hirst, head
of Heriot-Watt Business School. 'As a result the people who got the training
were not the ones who would benefit the company most. However, ScottishPower
and Dawson International have been closely involved in designing the
programme structure and will be active in maintaining quality and relevance
throughout.'
Mike Kinski, ScottishPower's human resources director explains: 'If we need
to compete in the increasingly competitive market place, we need to develop
in our managers a wider business understanding, increased commercial
awareness, a broader range of knowledge and improved leadership skills.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / People: Sir John Banham to chair Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After 15 years at the helm, Sir Eric Pountain, the colourful Black Country
businessman who led Tarmac through the 1980s, is stepping down as chairman
of Britain's biggest housebuilder.
He will be succeeded by Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government
Commission for England and a former director-general of the CBI.
Sir John, 53, became Tarmac's deputy chairman yesterday and will take over
from Sir Eric, just 60, early next year.
Along with Graeme Odgers and Bryan Baker, Sir Eric built Tarmac into one of
the best-managed and biggest companies in its field in the early 1980s,
having taken over as chief executive in 1979 and become chairman shortly
afterwards.
But Tarmac's fast growth strategy faltered with the onset of the recession
in the UK and US, and Tarmac was left exposed to the collapse of house
prices and sales.
Early last year Sir Eric agreed to relinquish day-to-day running of the
group to Neville Simms, who was appointed Tarmac's chief executive.
Sir John, who started his career in the Foreign Office in 1962, had been
widely tipped as Sir Eric's successor. After joining McKinsey &amp; Co in 1969,
he gained wide industrial experience in the US and UK over the next decade
before becoming the first Controller of the Audit Commission when it was
established in early 1983.
He has had long-standing interests in the area of housing, from his time at
the Audit Commission on education, housing and social services, and in
transport infrastructure, for which he was a leading advocate of increased
investment while director-general of the CBI.
Yesterday he said it was 'a great privilege' to take over from Sir Eric
'during whose chairmanship Tarmac's market capitalisation increased
tenfold'.

FT  22 SEP 93 / People: Charkham's 'rigorous' appraisal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Mr Corporate Governance' Jonathan Charkham, member of the Cadbury
Committee, first director of Pro Ned and author of a yet to appear but no
doubt worthy book on corporate good practice, has been appointed a
non-executive director of CrestaCare, the nursing home group. This is the
second such job he has picked up since retiring from being adviser on
industry to the governor of the Bank of England in June. The first was with
Great Universal Stores, rather larger than CrestaCare.
Indeed, his appointment must be something of a coup for CrestaCare, which
has seen its share of governance changes lately with both a new chairman and
chief executive in recent months. Current holder of the latter post Andrew
Taee, who joined in March after ousting John McAllister from the job, says
Charkham put CrestaCare through a 'rigorous' appraisal before accepting.
He apparently approved Taee's fixed, three year, Pounds 150,000 a year
contract. McAllister, who had a three year rolling contract at Pounds
100,000 a year, is thought to have received Pounds 300,000 compensation.
Charkham will chair the audit committee and sit on the remuneration
committee.
Charkham, a barrister by training, has also served on the committee of
corporate governance in the National Health Service, which will be handy
experience at CrestaCare - many of whose patients come from the NHS.
Scott Svenson is appointed director in charge of strategic development and
corporate finance; he joins from Apax Partners.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Management: Quantum leaps in a dangerous game - Keeping up
with the pace of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard on the heels of General Motors, Philips, IBM, Kodak and Volkswagen,
Daimler-Benz revealed last weekend how deeply it, too, is in the mire.
With disasters at such mega-companies mounting by the month, are
commentators right when they argue that the days of the large corporation
are numbered? Or is the western business world simply going through an
unusually intense phase of its natural cycle of life and death? Either way,
what can large companies do to postpone the evil day or - just possibly -
avoid it entirely?
These seminal questions towered above a thousand lesser puzzles about
corporate strategy and organisation last week in Chicago, where 600 business
academics, consultants and executives gathered at this year's annual meeting
of the international Strategic Management Society.
It was pure but painful coincidence that several top speakers threw the same
statistic at the audience: that almost 40 per cent of the companies which
comprised the Fortune 500 a decade ago no longer exist. Of the 1970 Fortune
list, 60 per cent have gone, either acquired or out of business, the
conference was told. And of the 12 companies which comprised the Dow Jones
Industrial index at the turn of the century, only General Electric survives
as a giant.
As one senior manager put it: 'Very few organisations last the lifetime of
an individual and still fewer lead their industry for more than 20 or 30
years.'
He was understating the problem. The average corporate survival rate for
large companies a decade ago was only about half as long as the life of a
human being, according to a well-publicised study of the time by the Shell
oil giant. Yet some companies last well over 75 years.
The phenomenon of rapid corporate decline and fall has two traditional
explanations: first, the inability of most companies to 'learn' and adapt at
least as rapidly as their environment changes; and second, the tendency of
companies in certain industries to be disrupted severely by technological
innovation.
Since the Shell study was done, the pace of change in the business
environment has accelerated on every front: capital and trade barriers have
been lowered, industrial competition has become global, technology has cut
the cost of breaking into new geographic and product markets, and companies
have recognised the benefits of collaboration rather than all-out merger or
acquisition.
As a result, many large companies are experiencing unprecedented pressure.
Contrary to fashionable wisdom, this is not only coming from smaller,
upstart companies taking advantage of the new competitive importance of
flexibility, but also from large companies which have been better able than
most of their peers to revitalise themselves.
Thus Kodak is reeling partly from Fuji and 3M, Sears from WalMart, and IBM
partly from Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard.
In these circumstances, the old 'success strategy' of continuously improving
one's performance is no longer adequate, the Chicago conference was told by
the managing partner of Arthur Andersen Consulting, George Shaheen. Instead,
companies in all sectors must focus on becoming 'not only better but
radically different'. They must take quantum leaps in order to reshape their
industries.
Roger Stone, the president and chief executive of his family's 67-year-old
corrugated packaging company, Stone Container Corporation of Chicago,
described how it is now revitalising itself after growing profitably 15-fold
in the 1980s, to annual sales of Dollars 5.5bn.
The keys to modern corporate 'learning' and transformation, said Stone,
were: to become even more 'customer-driven' and quality-focused; to
stimulate innovation throughout the company; to measure corporate and
individual performance on every possible dimension; to 'manage backwards
from the future, rather than short-term'; to simplify structures and
processes; and, above all, to foster a process of 'creative discontent'
within the company.
In his down-to-earth Midwest language, Stone concluded to loud applause that
'if you want to be content you should be a dog'.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Management: Sashimi and chips - A look at a bold exchange
programme between computer company ICL and its parent Fujitsu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Donald McGarva is a 32-year-old engineer from Scotland who has a job in a
factory. He is also a celebrity. The factory is in Numazu in Japan, and
McGarva, who works shoulder-to-shoulder with Japanese engineers, has a
worm's-eye view of working practices that are the envy of the world.
Diplomats, and businessmen from east and west consult him. Even John Major,
who visited Japan this week, dropped in on him to find out how things look
from his angle.
McGarva is one of 10 junior employees at ICL, the UK-based computer company,
who have been transferred for a two-year stint to Fujitsu, ICL's Japanese
parent. This select group is matched by a similar band of Fujitsu workers
who have been plunged into ICL. Both have had their cultural and
professional worlds turned upside down in the interests of what is known as
corporate 'synergy'.
When Fujitsu bought 80 per cent of ICL three years ago, it was decided that
the European company would continue to be run autonomously. Yet in order to
make sense of the new relationship, both businesses needed to find a way of
extracting some benefit from the other.
The exchange scheme was part of a master plan created by Peter Bonfield,
chairman of ICL and Fujitsu's president Tadashi Sekizawa. The aim was
twofold: to spread ideas from one company to another in an informal way and
to create a cadre of high fliers with the wherewithal to deal with an
international future.
It was recognised from the outset that the plan would only work if the top
people were prepared to learn from the trainees. Sekizawa makes sure he
knows the E-Mail indentity of each trainee and encourages them to send him
messages. This in itself was a breakthrough, as Japanese employees no more
dream of putting their own views to the president than of taking their
clothes off in the office. Yet already the electronic messages are flying
eastwards, and are being heeded.
One bold Japanese trainee was astounded to discover that ICL employees
volunteered for the exchange scheme, whereas Fujitsu trainees were chosen.
The experience of Satoshi Yamamoto was typical: he was told by his boss on
his wedding day that he would be leaving for ICL in two months.
The trainee suggested to Sekizawa that employees who put themselves forward
were likely to be more motivated. The president took note - somewhat to the
alarm of his personnel department - and vacancies on the scheme are now
being advertised. Nearly 100 people have applied for 10 positions in the
latest batch.
Bonfield, who lunches or dines with his trainees each time he visits Tokyo,
has been told in detail about the impressive technology used at Fujitsu. He
had also learnt some home truths about the way certain parts of ICL look
from the outside. According to McGarva: 'It's far from a perfect company.
There are some areas that I used to be proud of, but which I now see
differently. I can see areas where we can become more international.'
The lessons that are emerging from the first wave of exchanges are not what
one might expect. Japan has long been regarded as having near mystical
management ability. During the past decade, British companies have copied
wholesale Japanese working practices such as Just In Time delivery and Total
Quality Management. But to judge from the Fujitsu/ICL experience, some
management lessons are starting to flow the other way.
'Fujitsu people are eagerly seeking our opinions,' says McGarva. 'Japanese
companies are changing from the inside. Traditions like life-time employment
are starting to change.' The Fujitsu employees have found plenty to admire
in the way ICL is run. Yamamoto, who works for the personnel department, is
amazed at the care with which ICL graduates are picked. By contrast, the
1,200 or so graduates that are taken on each year by Fujitsu are hired by
the yard. He is also impressed by employees' tailor-made career plans. 'In
ICL, personnel objectives are clearly defined, and that improves motivation.
In Japan people are forced into uncomfortable objectives,' he says.
Kenji Watanabe is surprised at the degree of respect given to consultants
and technical people - which in Japan is reserved for the managers. Kenjiro
Serikawa has sampled the British two-to-three week summer holiday, and finds
he prefers it to the three to four days he might expect at home. 'Here I can
relax more,' he says.
But will these messages get through? 'Many Japanese companies are aware that
their style is not a perfect one, and are keen to learn something from
overseas,' says Watanabe.
These lessons have not been learnt without a cost: both sides have suffered
severe culture shock. Heidi Hunter, the first woman to be sent to Fujitsu,
had a double dose. 'The biggest shock was on the morning of the first day to
hear the company song on the PA, followed by exercises.' As a female
engineer, she was regarded as a freak: 'For the first six weeks the Japanese
didn't know where to pigeon-hole me. To survive you have to have a lot of
confidence. You've got to get up and do it.'
For Nigel Beane, who has been at Fujitsu for six months and lives in a
company flat, the most difficult moment was being woken up at 7.30am on a
Sunday morning by the company tannoy and being told it was a lovely day and
to take some exercise.
The ICL people came prepared with six months of intensive language and
culture training, yet they still felt at sea. But that was six months more
than the Fujitsu people had. Although most could already speak (American)
English, none had any idea of what to expect from working in the UK.
Serikawa found himself on the first day talking to customers in a language
that he was uncomfortable with about a computer system he did not know.
Watanabe could not understand why British managers found his customary
politeness absurd.
All have now acclimatised. Watanabe says he can switch the politeness on and
off depending on whether he is talking to British or Japanese colleagues.
Hunter is now treated like another engineer. McGarva introduces himself as
Fujitsu's Donald McGarva without thinking.
Much as each side has enjoyed its sojourn, there will be compensations to
going home. The Japanese trainees are looking forward to a public transport
system that works. Beane is looking forward to a lie-in.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Recruitment: What distinguishes play from working - The
danger of careless language is that the way we talk of things affects how we
think of them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER parents gave up saying such things after about 1950, the Jobs column
can only conjecture. But there's no doubt that its own old ears still ring
with a phrase dinned into them in boyhood, to wit: 'The time for play is
over; get down to some work]' The result is that I've grown up believing
those two activities are importantly different.
What causes me to suspect parental habits changed years ago is that,
nowadays, even people of fairly respectable ages don't share the same
abiding belief. Or so it would seem, at any rate, from the way they talk.
Only one among many recent examples was a comment made by the chief of a
company about executives being thrown out of their jobs. His words were:
'Increasing competition means we can't afford to pay any players who aren't
absolutely first class.'
The term players struck me as so wrong in the context that my impulse was to
ask him which games he paid them to play. Experience, however, led me to
stay silent. When I have raised the same point with others on previous
occasions, their typical response was to peer at me oddly and say they must
move on.
Even so, I have finally decided to raise it just once more because another
of my abiding beliefs is that the way we talk about things reflects how we
think of them. In which case, there are surely dangerous implications in
calling people 'players', as though they were indulging in mere pastimes,
when actually referring to their efforts to earn their bread.
There could well be a warning in the only other society which, to my
knowledge, has failed to distinguish between the two activities. It is the
Yir Yoront tribe of aboriginals in north-east Australia whose language,
according to a study by the anthropologist Lauriston Sharp in 1958,
recognises no difference between work and play. While that may serve them
OK, though, English-speaking nations aren't in the Yir Yoront's economic
position - or at least not yet. We might therefore be wise to avoid
following suit.
For it might be that the steps the Brits have already taken along that
particular linguistic road are not entirely unconnected with what has
happened to native British manufacturing.
It perhaps bodes no harm to talk of 'players' when referring to financial
go-getters in the City of London, where I first heard the term used in that
way. After all, 'playing' in the restricted sense of 'gambling' is a fair
description of what they do. The trouble is that the usage has since spread
to manufacturing and other sectors where the same justification does not
hold good.
Moreover, the people who now apply the term cavalierly across all sectors
include politicians as well as economists and such. Hence there might be a
deep-seated assumption in influential quarters that manufacturing and all
the rest are much like City operations. As further evidence, it is not all
that long since I heard certain policy-advisers, if not policy-makers,
privately welcoming redundancies in the finance sector on grounds that
they'd free 'clever' City people 'to go and run industry'.
But notions like those amount to a ludicrous oversimplification of the
activities of the other sectors in which just risking money, however
cannily, is far from the only thing that counts. Hence, for industry's sake,
it seems time we ceased calling workers 'players' altogether, and began
focusing sharply on the important differences between games and the business
of earning our keep.
For a start, although the basis of City operations can sensibly be likened
to 'playing at the tables', that does not place the finance sector's
activities on the sporting side of the divide. The fact that they have a
far-reaching effect on countless types of real-life work makes them an
instance of it too.
A further instance is politics. It's true the western democratic sort hinges
on games of make-believe, with different parties publicly indulging in
flights of fancy with the aim of attracting votes. It nevertheless belongs
in the work category because which party wins power has an impact on the far
from make-believe prospects, and perhaps survival, of large numbers of
people.
The same does not apply to games and sports which are played more or less
according to their own man-made rules, if not for their own sake. Moreover,
while they might have had a real-life application when first devised, they
often leave it behind in their development.
An example is the high-jump event. Excellence at it could enable people to
escape a pursuer by clearing a lofty obstacle that forced the chaser to make
a detour - always provided that the jumper was able to go on running quickly
after landing.
At the time the Jobs column was nearing mere middle age, the world high-jump
record had been inched up to some two metres. Since then the record has
soared by about a quarter as much again.
The inching-up was done with techniques like the Straddle in which good
jumpers landed feet downwards so that, despite falling on hard earth, they
were fit to get up and go. The soaring came with the change to the Fosbury
Flop. But it entails a back-down descent which would scarcely guarantee the
jumpers' fitness if they had to land on solid ground instead of a cushion.
So the height has gone up at the cost of real-world application. Since the
rule-makers aren't interested in the coming-down bit, however, that doesn't
matter.
Yet oddly enough, although such exercises belong to the games category, they
are found in the world of work including even manufacturing industry. An
example has just been reported by a necessarily anonymous reader in the
shape of the frequent management committee meetings of his outfit, a large
group's subsidiary.
When he joined 20 years ago, he says, the meetings spent a good deal of time
on innovation. The various managers bounced speculative ideas off one
another in front of the listening chief, who rarely said anything but 'Yes,
start on that' or 'No, forget it'. Nowadays the free-wheeling speculators
have been succeeded by aggressively ambitious heads of sections, and the
chief does much more of the talking.
'If you came along, you'd be very impressed because they all not only know
their stuff, but can put it over cleverly,' he adds. 'Anyone who says
something contradicted by the known facts gets cut to pieces, and nobody
cuts better than the managing director. Unfortunately, the fear of being
razored stops people from saying anything they are not sure of, and in my
experience making new discoveries often depends on people being willing to
risk being exposed as ignorant. Thus we've gained in knowledge of what we're
doing now, but lost out on innovation.'
Now, unless the Jobs column is one of the Yir Yoront, that's a case of the
Fosbury Flop in an industrial arena - which has implications for the focus
on the differences between work and play. For the two aren't totally fenced
off from each other. Games, at least, spill over into work activities. Even
if possible, identifying and ejecting such games need not be beneficial,
since they may be productive and perhaps fun too. But if they are neither,
it's surely worth moving mountains, not to mention the rule-makers, to get
rid of them.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Labour ducks education funding row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ELEVENTH-hour decision by Labour to delay publication of a discussion
document on higher education overshadowed its launch yesterday of a paper on
A-levels.
The consultative document suggested that graduates might be asked to meet
part of the cost of university education, although it was made clear that
this was not official party policy.
The decision not to publish the document will raise fresh doubts about the
Labour leadership's willingness to confront difficult issues, before the
party's annual conference in Brighton next week.
Officials said the decision - taken late on Monday by senior party figures
including Mr John Smith, Labour leader - was intended to avoid distracting
attention from other aspects of its education green paper. They said the
document would be published after the party's conference.
Copies of the document had already been distributed to university
vice-chancellors, who are meeting in Leicester.
It says that higher education is 'not a pure collective good', and that the
system is constrained by supply rather than demand. It says: 'Inequity has
to be removed, and the system has to be paid for at some time by someone.'
The move was understood to have dismayed some frontbench speakers. One
Labour MP said he now doubted whether the party would formally publish the
document.
It is now thought likely that Mr Jeff Rooker, the education spokesman who
wrote the paper, will submit a lightly redrafted version to Labour's
Commission on Social Justice in a personal capacity.
University vice-chancellors will announce which extra source of funds they
favour tomorrow. Mr John Patten, education secretary, will address them on
the topic today.
Mr Patten yesterday said: 'I do think there's a very strong moral argument
for saying that those who benefit from higher education through a lifetime
should make a contribution.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / Battersea power station threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTORS at Battersea power station in London are threatening to remove
steel supports holding up part of the structure because of a dispute with
its owners.
Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons, which is owed about Pounds 20m for civil
engineering work undertaken on the site, is in dispute with the Hwang family
of Hong Kong which in effect now owns the site as mortgagee.
The family, represented in Britain by Mr Victor Hwang, took possession of
the building at the weekend and locked the gates on McAlpine workers who had
been looking after site offices and machinery.
McAlpine has rejected a Hwang offer of 1p in the pound for its debt.
It is demanding its machinery back and says it wants to remove structural
supports installed under its contract with Mr John Broome's Battersea
Leisure, the former owner of the site.
Mr Simon Broakes, McAlpine's group property and special projects manager,
said: 'We have literally been supporting that building for many years. We
would not do anything to compromise the structural integrity of the
building. But Victor Hwang has to decide whether he wants to buy the
steelwork or replace it with his own.'
McAlpine has agreed that it will only remove the steelwork under the
supervision of English Heritage which has responsibility for listing
historical monuments.
English Heritage said yesterday that any structural alteration to the
building would require listed building consent.

FT  22 SEP 93 / London is 'best for business in Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON is considered the best city in Europe to locate a business, a survey
of international managers said yesterday.
The survey found that London had strengthened its position as a commercial
centre. It was carried out by the Harris Research Centre and published by
Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors. For the first time in the survey's
four-year history, the capital was considered to offer the most in terms of
cost and availability of staff.
Paris maintained its position at second, while the third most popular city
was Frankfurt, which retained its top position for international transport
links but lost ground on staff costs and availability.
Glasgow and Manchester both slipped one place to seventh and ninth
respectively.
Fourth-placed Brussels was considered the most important future political
centre.
The survey suggested that Barcelona, Berlin, Lyons and Paris were best at
promoting themselves to international businesses. For the first time Prague
was judged to be one of Europe's most important future manufacturing
centres.
The most important factors influencing relocations were ease of access to
markets and telecommunications. Cost and availability of staff and freedom
from pollution were seen as increasingly important.
A total of 527 senior executives from nine European countries were
interviewed for the survey.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Patten rules out change to A-level exams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday said the government had 'no
intention whatsoever' of changing A-level examinations, in spite of a Labour
proposal that they should be replaced.
He pointed out that sixth-formers had the choice of AS-levels, which allow
supplementary subjects, and vocational A-levels. He said: 'I think it would
be perverse to get rid of a qualification which is admired and respected
throughout the world in favour of a system based on the lowest common
denominator.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said this showed that Mr Patten
was 'wrong and in isolation'. She said: 'It's not just the Labour party
which is calling for the abolition of A-levels.'
She described the list of organisations which have called for reform as
'both extensive and impressive'. It includes the university vice-chancellors
and the standing conference on university entrance, as well as the
Confederation of British Industry and the two main bodies representing
independent secondary schools, the Headmasters' Conference and the Girls'
Schools Association. The Institute of Management also opposes A-levels.
Labour's proposals, which are still consultative, envisage a General
Certificate of Further Education (GCFE) which would allow students to
accumulate credits until the age of 18 in a variety of academic and
vocational subjects. Further education would be more closely integrated with
sixth-form colleges.
Mrs Taylor said: 'We want to structure education provision so that young
people do not regard 16 as the end of their educational experience. A GCFE
would help young people to see education as on-going and could be part of a
continuous structure for the 14-to-18-plus age group.'
Labour's proposal is in line with the recommendations of Sir Ron Dearing,
chairman-designate of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, who
is reviewing the national curriculum for England and Wales.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Night flying curbs prompt court move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE living near the three main airports around London face increased
levels of night noise from aircraft if the government is allowed to
introduce a controversial system of flying restrictions, the High Court was
told yesterday.
Under the new system favouring 'quieter' aircraft, the number of take-offs
and landings at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would rise sharply.
Richmond and Tandridge councils in Surrey, and Windsor and Maidenhead and
Slough councils in Berkshire, and the London borough of Hillingdon were
applying for a judicial review of a decision by Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, to introduce new restrictions from October 24. The councils have
financial support from eight other local authorities.
Mr Richard Gordon, representing the councils, told Mr Justice Laws that the
present regime dated from 1988 and imposed a straightforward curb on the
number of night flights.
He said there were fears that the number of after-dark flights at Heathrow
could rise under the new system from 5,750 a year to 24,000. Since 1981 the
government had a policy of encouraging more flights made by quieter
aircraft, and that same policy was meant to underly the new restrictions.
Mr Gordon said it was uncontentious that night noise levels had decreased
since 1988. But Mr MacGregor was now planning to use powers provided under
the 1982 Civil Aviation Act to curb noise nuisance in effect to increase the
number of flights from airports which would disrupt people's sleep, said Mr
Gordon.
Under the act, the transport secretary has the power to lessen or extinguish
noise, and that he had therefore acted outside his powers in making
proposals which would increase existing noise levels.
The hearing was adjourned until today. Manchester airport was yesterday
voted the best airport in the UK, with Gatwick second and Heathrow third in
the 1993 Travel Awards sponsored by Travel Trade Gazette, the industry
paper, and Express Newspapers.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Agenda switch may aid Smith reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VICTORY for Mr John Smith over some key unions at next week's Labour party
conference on the issue of one-member-one-vote for parliamentary selections
may depend on procedural manoeuvre.
To maximise the chances of Mr Smith's reforms prevailing, the party's
national executive is today expected to endorse a plan to switch the debate
from Monday, as originally planned, to Wednesday morning.
The vote is likely to be extremely close and several union delegations are
expected to decide which way to vote at the last moment.
The switch means that the debate, and vote, will take place after Mr Smith's
set-piece address on the Tuesday of the conference which, Smith supporters
hope, will provide another opportunity to sway union delegations.
The way in which the vote is taken could also determine the outcome. It
seems probable that the various union amendments to the reform proposals
tabled by Mr Smith will be taken before the substantive motion on these.
Mr Smith's advisers are confident that none of the union amendments - from
the TGWU and GMB general unions, Nupe, the public-service union, and the
AEEU engineering and electrical union - will muster a majority. If the rule
change is taken at the end of the process, then that will increase pressure
on some unions to back it. Otherwise the party could be left with no policy
at all.
That plan could be thwarted by the TGWU. If this union, along with several
small leftwing unions, decided to back the GMB amendment after its own fell,
that might produce a majority against the reform plan. The AEEU, however,
yesterday released figures from a MORI poll which shows that both TGWU and
GMB members show above average support among union members for the reforms.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Swan Hunter cuts 80 further jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 80 jobs are to go at Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter, unions were
told yesterday, bringing to 830 the number shed since the company went into
receivership in May.
After a meeting with receivers Price Waterhouse, Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne
chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said
the scale of the latest redundancies had been less than expected.
This was partly due to hopes that Swan Hunter will win more work on the
auxiliary oiler replenishment ship, Fort George, built by the company and
handed over in March.
Mr Brennan said if this work goes ahead it would employ 150 people for about
seven weeks from late October.
The Ministry of Defence confirmed it is discussing with the receivers 'minor
adjustments' and defect rectification work on Fort George arising from its
trials. The MoD declined to say whether other shipbuilders had been
approached about the work. Its value has not been disclosed.
Mr Brennan said the discussions were a welcome sign that, contrary to union
anxieties, Swans may still be able to win MoD work while the receivers seek
a buyer for the company. He said they remained 'very optimistic' about an
eventual sale.
The 80 redundancies affect manual workers. They will leave by the end of
next week, reducing the workforce to around 1,600. Joint administrative
receiver Mr Ed James said job cuts were inevitable as work on three Navy
frigates, the only work in progress at Swans, neared completion.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Farmers predict smaller harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Farmers' Union yesterday predicted a fall of nearly 12 per cent
in this year's grain harvest to 19.5m tonnes.
The union blamed bad weather conditions during planting and the effects of
Common Agricultural Policy reforms, notably the requirement that arable
farmers must leave part of their land fallow to qualify for compensation for
cuts in European Community support prices.
Mr David Naish, union president, said: 'Apart from climatic factors, British
farmers are having to adjust their businesses to take account of the
three-year CAP reform package agreed by EC agriculture ministers last year
and this is obviously having a significant effect on the way their land is
farmed.'
The Ministry of Agriculture announced yesterday that the total area planted
with cereals had fallen by 13 per cent to 3m hectares this year, the first
year of CAP set-aside. The wheat area was down 15 per cent and barley down
10 per cent.
Last week Dalgety Agriculture estimated a much bigger grain harvest of 20.9m
tonnes. Predictions vary each year, and Dalgety calculates its yields per
hectare in a different way to the union, giving a higher figure for wheat.
The union's arable crops survey estimated a 1m-tonne drop in the wheat
harvest to 13.1m tonnes in spite of a 9 per cent increase in yields. It
expected the barley crop to fall from 7.4m tonnes to 5.9m tonnes.
The agriculture ministry's figure for the total harvest last year, which was
a poor one for cereals, was 22.1m tonnes. The 1991 harvest was 22.6m tonnes.

FT  22 SEP 93 / French are wooed in tourism drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Tourist Authority today begins a campaign to persuade even more
French visitors to cross the Channel, with the official opening in central
Paris of a new UK tourist centre, Maison de la Grande Bretagne.
The centre will be opened by Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary. More
excitement is likely to be generated by Jane Birkin, the Paris-based British
actress, who has promised to make an appearance. Food will be provided by
Marks and Spencer, which has a store down the road.
The centre's ground floor offers video displays and a bookshop. British Rail
International has an office there, as do some ferry companies.
Mr Bruce Taylor, the authority's manager in France, says the centre was set
up because 86 per cent of French visitors to the UK make their travel
arrangements independently rather than through travel agents. The new centre
will enable them to make all their bookings at the same time.
Last year 2.5m French residents made a trip to the UK, second only to the
2.7m American visitors.
But the average French tourist to the UK spent only Pounds 28.10 a day last
year, compared with an American tourist's average expenditure of Pounds
55.20 a day.
One of the reasons is that many French visitors are students. In 1991, 24
per cent of French tourists were under 16 and more than 40 per cent were
under 25. On present form 60 per cent will come back as higher-spending
adults.
Mr Frederic Simonet, a technology student, and Ms Anne Morvan, studying
English, were at the centre last week to book a weekend in London in
October. London has three attractions, they say. It is nearby, they can
practise their English and the shops are different.

FT  22 SEP 93 / GDP exceeds estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMY expanded faster in the second quarter than initially estimated
partly as a result of people saving less, government figures showed
yesterday.
However, the platform for recovery still appears to be fragile. Pre-tax
personal incomes between April and June showed their first quarterly fall
for 27 years, partly because of low wage increases, a fall in social
security benefits and weaker investment income linked to lower interest
rates.
Another sign of economic weakness was an unexpectedly large fall of 3.5 per
cent in the second quarter in manufacturing investment, after several
quarters in which capital spending by this sector had appeared to be on a
slow upward trend.
Second-quarter gross domestic product grew 0.6 per cent in real,
inflation-adjusted terms compared with the January-to-March period. The
seasonally adjusted figure was higher than the 0.5 per cent estimate first
published by the Central Statistical Office.
In the year to the second quarter, the economy expanded 2 per cent.
Excluding North Sea oil and gas extraction, GDP was up 0.5 per cent in the
second quarter compared with the first quarter, a year-on-year increase of
1.7 per cent.
The savings ratio - personal savings as a percentage of personal disposable
income - fell from a revised 11.8 per cent in the first quarter to 10.1 per
cent in the second quarter.
This was the biggest quarterly decline in the ratio since early 1986. The
ratio reflects changes in savings behaviour by individuals as well as
non-profitmaking bodies such as charities and universities.
The fall came after a long period in which people saved more, inhibiting
strong growth in consumer spending. In 1991 and 1992, the savings ratio
stayed high at 10.1 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively.
In spite of an increase in dividend payments, pre-tax personal income fell
0.4 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, measured
in current prices.
Total personal disposable income - income less taxes - fell 1 per cent in
current prices in the quarter and 1.6 per cent in inflation-adjusted terms.
This was the biggest fall since early 1985.
Yesterday's revised figures show five successive quarters of growth in the
onshore economy since the recession officially ended in the second quarter
last year. Statisticians now say the recession lasted seven quarters, not
eight as previously thought, making it about the same length as the 1979-81
economic decline.
The CSO data also highlights:
Consumer spending rose 0.4 per cent in real terms in the second quarter
compared with the first quarter, for a 1.6 per cent rise on the
corresponding period last year. Output of the financial and business
services industry expanded in the April-June period by a quarterly 1.1 per
cent and by 3.5 per cent on a year earlier. The comparable figures for all
service industries were 0.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively.
The second-quarter gross domestic product deflator, indicating general
inflationary pressures throughout the economy, was recorded as zero. This is
the lowest figure for a quarterly deflator since 1986 and illustrates the
low price pressures partly related to a fall in export prices linked to
sterling's devaluation.
Companies' receipts in the second quarter were Pounds 1.4bn higher than
spending, the second consecutive quarterly surplus.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Record sales of securities help boost economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS institutions bought record volumes of UK financial securities in
the second quarter, helping to finance the current account deficit.
During the period non-UK groups purchased securities including government
gilts and corporate stocks and bonds worth a total of Pounds 13.82bn.
This was almost two thirds of the Pounds 21.39bn figure for the whole of
last year and well up on the previous quarterly record of Pounds 8bn seen in
late 1987.
Non-UK groups bought gilts worth Pounds 4.58bn in the second quarter, in
response to large issues of the securities by the Bank of England to finance
government borrowing.
Overseas investments in securities formed part of the capital inflows which
helped to finance the second quarter's Pounds 2.68bn current account
deficit.
The current account deficit, mainly accounted for by an excess of imports
over exports of merchandise goods and oil, has to be balanced by a flow of
cash into the UK on the capital account. In the first quarter the deficit on
the current account was Pounds 2.99bn, while for the whole of last year it
was Pounds 8.62bn.
The Pounds 3.3bn deficit on merchandise, or visible deficit, during the
second quarter was partly offset by a Pounds 621m surplus on invisible trade
 -payments of interest, profits and dividends. The second-quarter invisibles
surplus was a slight improvement on the first quarter's Pounds 512m. Last
year the invisibles surplus totalled Pounds 4.79bn.
In the second quarter service industries earned a net Pounds 1.13bn on
overseas trade, compared with a Pounds 1.47bn surplus in the first quarter.
The UK had net earnings in the second quarter of Pounds 684m on invisible
trade. The comparable figure for January to March was Pounds 356m.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Wage costs stable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WAGES PER UNIT of output across the economy barely changed between the final
quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year, underlining the
weakness of inflationary pressures.
In the second quarter, unit wage costs were down 0.9 per cent compared with
the same period a year ago. This was the same year-on-year drop as in the
first quarter, according to seasonally adjusted Department of Employment
figures.
Particularly strong downward pressure on unit wage costs has come from the
manufacturing sector, which saw a 1.2 per cent fall in these costs in the
second quarter compared with three months earlier.
In the second quarter, unit wage costs in manufacturing were 2.1 per cent
down on a year earlier, compared with a 2.8 per cent year-on-year drop in
the first three months of 1993.
Output per employed person throughout the economy in the second quarter was
up 4.5 per cent on a year earlier, the same as the yearly rise for the
January to March period. Output per head in the second quarter was up 0.4
per cent on the first quarter, continuing the trend towards higher
productivity seen over the past year.
In the second quarter, manufacturing productivity was up 7.2 per cent on the
corresponding period last year. In the first quarter the equivalent figure
was 7.9 per cent.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Manufacturing upbeat in Wales

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RURAL WALES has shown a resilience to the recession with its manufacturing
sector investing at record levels and unemployment lower than the national
average, the development board for the region said yesterday.
The Development Board for Rural Wales, which covers 40 per cent of the
principality's land area, said in its annual report that the manufacturing
sector had doubled in size in the past decade and now accounted for 17 per
cent of jobs.
In 1992-93, the board offered Pounds 3.6m in grants and loans to stimulate a
record Pounds 25.7m of planned investment by the region's manufacturers. A
total of 25 inward investment projects were won which the board said would
support nearly 700 jobs within three years.
The board has stopped building speculative premises and now concentrates on
pre-let workspace. It is encouraging more private-sector involvement in
construction and wants to provide space for a wider variety of businesses.
Mr Glyn Davies, chairman, said there were 'very major challenges' for the
future. Gross domestic product and weekly earnings remained unacceptably low
compared with the national average, and there was a steady migration of
young people.
Although unemployment in 1992-93 was 2 percentage points below the national
average, there were pockets of high unemployment.
'We also face serious problems arising from structural change in the
agricultural industry, the energy supply industry and, to a limited extent,
the defence industry,' he said.
In July the National Audit Office criticised the board for the way in which
it had allocated housing. The board has changed its practices.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Foreign groups intensify battle in PC market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION IN Britain's personal computer market, already the fiercest in
Europe, has intensified sharply with the arrival of two large companies from
the US and continental Europe.
Plans to take a share of the UK's Pounds 3bn personal computer market were
announced yesterday by Gateway 2000, a large US manufacturer.
Vobis Microcomputer of Germany announced plans to enter the UK market last
month. Gateway will market its full range of computers direct to users while
Vobis is selling its 'Highscreen' brand through Dixons, the electrical
retailer.
Direct-selling manufacturers use neither retailers nor distributors but
advertise their products in newspapers and trade magazines, completing the
deal by telephone or mail order. The technique was pioneered by Dell
Computer Corporation of the US which has grown in a decade to revenues last
year of Dollars 2bn. More than 30 per cent of PCs are now sold in the UK
this way.
Gateway says it sells more IBM-compatible PCs this way in the US than any
other manufacturer. It has set up an assembly and distribution centre in
Dublin from which it intends to attack the UK market before moving into
France and Germany. It was established in 1985 and employs 2,500 people in
the US. It made pretax profits of Dollars 105m last year on a turnover of
Dollars 1.1bn.
Vobis, one of the largest PC manufacturers in Germany, is following its
compatriot Escom AG, which this year started a chain of small retail stores
in the UK. About 15 have already opened and Escom is aiming to have 26 by
the end of next month.
The PC market in the UK has grown vigorously over the past 12 months -
driven by substantial advertising campaigns and falling prices. According to
Context, a London-based consultancy, sales this year are likely to be 22 per
cent up on last year.
Some 93,000 units were shipped in July alone, 37 per cent more than the year
before. The value of the computers shipped increased by only 17 per cent,
however, an indication of the sharp decline in unit prices. Context says the
average price of a system is now Pounds 1,400; most experts believe prices
will not fall much lower but customers will get more features for the same
price. Most machines are based around the leading Intel 486/SX
microprocessor.
According to the marketing consultancy Romtec, Compaq of the US has the
lion's share of the UK market with 13 per cent. IBM is only 1 percentage
point behind. Apple has 7 per cent and Dell has 6 per cent. Toshiba, Elonex
and Olivetti hold 4 per cent apiece while none of the other 200 or so
manufacturers have more than 3 per cent of the market.
Mr Ted Waitt, the chief executive of Gateway, said the UK launch had been
planned for three years. He said Gateway hoped to sell by innovative
advertising, low prices and first-rate customer service. A top-of-the-range
system would sell for less than Pounds 2,500.
Mr Michael Spiro, finance director for the UK company Elonex, which will
compete with Gateway in the direct market, said the US company's declared
prices did not seem all that exciting: 'What can they do? They have to use
the same components from the same sources as everybody else.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / Motor design breakthrough hailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH scientists and component manufacturers yesterday welcomed a
breakthrough in the design of electrical motors which, they claim, could
revolutionise power systems in domestic appliances and cars by making them
smaller and lighter.
Launching a three-year programme to develop the new motors, scientists from
the universities of Warwick and Cardiff said the innovation could lead to a
60 per cent reduction in the size of motors needed to power products ranging
from food mixers and power tools to car-steering systems.
The development programme is backed by a consortium of 22 companies
including Black and Decker, Lucas Industries, Kenwood and Vent-Axia, and
will be part-funded by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Unlike traditional motors which rely on electrical connectors to drive them,
the new motors have no electrical contact between the power source and the
drum - the part of the motor that revolves.
The motors are driven by coils of wire energised by pulses of electricity
400 times a second. The process, called switched reluctance drive, creates
an energy field which rotates the drum and generates the power to move
components.
The principle of switched reluctance drive is not new, and other research
companies and manufacturers are testing it. However, this is thought to be
the first time such a system has achieved standards acceptable to industry.
The system has been pioneered by Dr Charles Pollock, a lecturer in power
electronics at the University of Warwick, and Professor Hugh Bolton of the
University of Wales College of Cardiff.
Dr Pollock said: 'By breaking away from conventional technology we can
radically change the design of products.
For the automotive industry, this could be the equivalent of fly-by-wire -
it could lead to electrical steering and doing away with traditional
mechanical systems.'
Mr David Shaw, a senior electronics engineer at Black and Decker, said: 'The
potential is enormous. There's no blow-out or stalling with these motors; we
may even be able to fit them into the handle of a power drill.'
Vent-Axia said that such motors could be fitted in its 400,000-product
range. 'It will give us cost savings and increased efficiency,' said Mr
David Vincent, technical director.

FT  22 SEP 93 / 'Barmy' tape sets rebels at PM's throat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative leadership issue took a fresh twist yesterday after it
emerged that Mr John Major's remarks referring to backbench critics as
'barmy' were recorded.
The tape is believed to have been made during a party at the British embassy
in Tokyo, where Mr Major has just finished a four-day official visit.
Some MPs, believed to be among those Mr Major was referring to, retorted in
kind, suggesting it was not them but the prime minister himself to whom that
adjective could be best applied.
Sir Richard Body, Tory MP for Holland with Boston, said Mr Major's comments
were 'rather sad'. He said: 'A number of us have been trying to get a
message through to him that there is growing disillusionment in the country
. . . but he won't listen.'
Sir Richard, who has been tipped as a possible 'stalking horse' challenger
to Mr Major this autumn, said a number of 'very ordinary' Tory MPs had
contacted him since he first raised the leadership issue to say their
constituents were saying the same.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay and another of Mr Major's fiercest
critics, said a prime minister who did not 'listen to his own grassroots is
barmy'.
The tape is thought to have been the basis of an article in yesterday's
Independent newspaper which claimed that Mr Major had drawn up a 'hit list'
of rebels.
Mr Major yesterday dismissed the Independent story as 'silly,' and said he
had no idea where the suggestion of a 'hit list' had come from.
Although the tape is thought unlikely to contain more damaging material, its
existence could further anger the rebels, who have rebuffed a demand from
the prime minister for an end to 'stupid internecine squabbling' in the
Conservative party.
The episode also confirms that the uncertainty over Mr Major's leadership is
unlikely to fade before the party conference next month, when he is planning
a showdown with the rebels.
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Portillo, the Thatcherite chief secretary to the
Treasury, became the latest heavyweight to call publicly for a halt to the
sniping. 'We have to make it very plain to people that it is a nice luxury
to be a rebel and to sound off against the government, but eventually this
government has to govern,' he said.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Europe's 'green' policy attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM YEO, environment minister, yesterday attacked European environment
policy, saying there was 'growing cynicism among the public' that other
European countries would ever be forced to comply with a host of European
directives.
His criticism comes two days before the government and the water industry
will press for a revision of the EC 1980 drinking water directive to allow
countries more discretion in setting standards.
Speaking in Manchester at an international environmental conference hosted
by the government, Mr Yeo said the 'temperature, taste and odour' of
drinking water were 'not the European Commission's business'.
Tomorrow's meeting of government officials in Brussels was organised by the
commission after months of lobbying by Eureau, the association of European
water suppliers. It will be the first attempt to renegotiate the drinking
water directive. Mr Yeo called the directive 'very out-of-date'.
Much of the UK water industry's Pounds 45bn investment programme is directed
towards meeting EC standards on drinking water and sewage treatment.
The water services association, which represents the 10 large UK water
companies, together with Ofwat, the industry regulator, have called for a
revision of the standards to help slow the rise in bills.
Mr Yeo acknowledged that other countries - particularly the Netherlands,
Germany and Denmark - may call on Britain to tighten controls on
agricultural pesticides.
Any move to restrict farmers from using pesticides, which contaminate water
supplies and need expensive treatment to be removed, is likely to provoke
controversy between the government and farmers.
The Eureau proposals call for new drinking water standards to focus on
health, not 'aesthetic factors', and to specify average levels of permitted
substances instead of maximum levels.

BRITISH STEEL pensioners are threatening legal action unless the company
agrees to discuss changes made to its Pounds 4.4bn pension fund since
privatisation.
The National Association of British Steel Pensioners is to campaign for the
support of 190,000 pensioners who retired from British Steel before June

FT  22 SEP 93 / Directors accused of Pounds 12m fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOUBLE-GLAZING company defrauded customers and creditors of more than
Pounds 12m, Birmingham Crown Court was told yesterday.
Mr Martin Wilson QC said that Therm-a-stor and its holding company Thermal
Securities collapsed in 1990 with the loss of 600 jobs. When the
Peterborough-based company collapsed secured creditors were owed Pounds 8m,
suppliers Pounds 2.5m and customers Pounds 1.6m, the court heard.
Mr John Morris, former chairman of Thermal Securities, and Mr Anthony
Bonnar, former managing director of Therm-a-stor, both deny one charge of
defrauding customers and one of defrauding creditors.
The trial continues today.

THE LABOUR party has called on the government to investigate the growth of
bancassurance groups which span the banking and insurance sectors.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, is writing today to Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, asking him to urgently examine the implications of
the sector.
In a speech in Glasgow yesterday Mr Darling said there was a substantial
risk that bancassurance groups would create financial conglomerates that
would ruthlessly exploit their selling power.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Unit trust sales at August record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNIT trust industry had its best-ever August last month, with net sales
reaching Pounds 981m, even higher than in August 1987, the peak of the 1980s
bull market, Philip Coggan writes.
The main influence seems to have been private investors. Net sales to retail
investors were Pounds 555m, with UK balanced funds, which offer a mixture of
bonds and equities, proving the biggest draw.
Mrs Victoria Nye, director of communications at the Association of Unit
Trust and Investment Funds, said: 'UK balanced funds, especially when held
in a personal equity plan, are particularly attractive to building society
savers whose income has been falling over the past three years.'
August was a good month for world stock markets, and that factor, combined
with the the interest of retail investors, pushed the industry's funds under
management to Pounds 84bn, the 10th consecutive month in which a record high
has been reached.
Gross sales of unit trusts in August were Pounds 1.8bn compared with Pounds
555m in August 1992. Repurchases from investors were Pounds 826m compared
with Pounds 496m a year earlier. The number of unit-holder accounts also
increased to 4.76m compared with 4.4m a year ago.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Downturn forces Nissan to halve output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is to halve production at its Pounds 900m car
plant at Sunderland in the final two months of the year under the impact of
the sharp decline in sales of new cars in continental Europe.
Nissan, which exports about 80 per cent of its output from its Sunderland
plant, is the latest victim of the downturn in European demand for new cars
which has forced widespread job losses, production cuts and restructuring
across the European motor industry.
Elsewhere in the UK, Vauxhall has imposed extensive short-time working at
its two assembly plants this month, while Ford, Rover and Peugeot have cut
several thousand jobs, and output at Vauxhall, Ford and Peugeot has fallen.
Nissan said yesterday that it would move to single-shift working for two
months from November 8 by eliminating the night shift in order to cut output
from 1,200 cars a day to about 600 cars.
Some 2,400 of its 4,600 employees will work only every other week in
November and December. They will remain on full basic pay, which averages
Pounds 13,164 a year for an assembly-line worker, but will lose night-shift
bonuses which average Pounds 183 a month.
Nissan halted all recruitment at the Sunderland plant in May, and the
workforce is now shrinking through non-replacement at the rate of 180 jobs a
year.
The production cut is the first big setback suffered by Nissan at
Sunderland, the first Japanese car plant in Europe, where it started small
volume output in 1986. For the full year of 1993 it is now cutting output by
8.9 per cent to 246,000 from the total of 270,000 forecast earlier this
year, and it warned yesterday that production could fall further next year.
Output of the Primera large family car will drop to only 93,500 this year
from 141,800 in 1992, a 34 per cent decline. Production of the Micra small
car, which started in August last year, will total 152,500 compared with the
37,200 produced in the last five months of 1992.
Nissan had planned originally to produce at close to full capacity for the
first time this year at Sunderland. Production for the year will still be 37
per cent higher than the 179,000 cars it produced last year, but as the
plant reaches maturity it is no longer able to insulate itself from the
downturn in European demand.
The company said yesterday that the impact of recession in Europe was likely
to wipe out the pre-tax profit of Pounds 29.6m earned last year by Nissan
Motor Manufacturing (UK), the Sunderland production plant, which was now
expected only to break even this year.
Nissan is grappling with severe problems worldwide. The consolidated Nissan
group is in overall loss for the second year running. It is being forced to
close a plant in Japan and in Spain, where its Nissan Motor Iberica
operations ran up losses of Pta23.1bn (Pounds 117m) in the first half of the
year, it has announced that it is to lay off 5,100 workers at its Barcelona
and Madrid plants for 11 days during October and November in order to cut
output by 4,000 vehicles.
The recovery in UK demand for new cars this year - sales rose by 11.8 per
cent in the first eight months of the year - has only protected carmakers to
a small extent against the recession in the rest of west Europe. Nissan's
high level of exports from its Sunderland plant means it has been hit hard
by the overall 16 per cent drop in sales of new cars in west Europe in the
first eight months of the year.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Cutbacks no surprise for parts suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 200 UK-based suppliers of components to Nissan's Sunderland plants
had been battening down the hatches well before they were told formally of
the end-of-year cutbacks at a plant meeting on Monday night.
Few among even the smallest suppliers to UK motor manufacturers have not
been fully aware of the downturn in continental European car markets and the
inability of even a recovering UK market to sustain car output levels.
GKN said cuts by Nissan and other carmakers had been largely discounted when
GKN further reduced its workforce by 1,000 earlier this year and streamlined
operations.
Mr John Southgate, GKN public-affairs director, said yesterday: 'We don't
necessarily wait to take action until it's in the public domain.'
GKN, Lucas Automotive and other suppliers were being informally warned as
long as two months ago that Nissan's output was set to fall sharply.
Lucas said yesterday: 'We had anticipated a slowdown across the market, and
Nissan forms part of that.'
It added: 'Production levels are already reflected in the 4,000 reduction in
employee numbers we made last year.'
Nissan represents only 2 per cent of Lucas' total Pounds 1.5bn annual
automotive turnover.
However, the impact on small local suppliers, in some cases set up initially
solely to serve Nissan, is inevitably much more severe.
Sommer Industry, a subsidiary of the French Alibert group, went into
production a stone's throw from the Nissan plant purely to supply the
interior trim of the Sunderland-built cars.
It has 110 employees and a turnover of about Pounds 12m. Aware of its
vulnerability as a supplier to a single customer it has been broadening its
customer base. Some 80 per cent of turnover comes from Nissan, and its
output of Nissan-related supplies will be halved from November 8. But it
plans no redundancies or lay-offs. The night shift will be suspended and
workers moved to other daytime tasks.
'For two months we will be able to live with it,' said one senior executive
yesterday. 'But if the situation should extend beyond 1993 perhaps our
position will have to be reviewed.'
Nearby, Ikeda Hoover also plans to tough it out. It makes seats and
headlinings for Nissan and again was set up with this specific role.
Mr Brian Hodgson, general manager, said that it would have to cut production
in line with Nissan but that it, too, intended to make no redundancies or
lay-offs among its 520 employees.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Mellor defends exports to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT ministers approved the export of machine tools to Iraq which may
have been in breach of the government's own publicly declared guidelines,
the Scott inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr David Mellor, Foreign Office minister from June 1987 to July 1988, said
that he had supported the exports after receiving a Foreign Office report
which excluded intelligence information warning of the exports' potential
military application.
He justified the government's decision, taken in early 1988, on the grounds
that the export licences referred to contracts entered into before the
guidelines were announced to the House of Commons in October 1985.
While accepting the intelligence excluded from the report was important, Mr
Mellor refused to blame his officials.
He said: 'I don't want to shelter behind the notion that I didn't know all
that I ought to know when I was making a decision.'
He said that the Foreign Office at the time was facing enormous pressures
from other government departments to let the exports through mainly for
commercial reasons.
'At the Department of Trade and Industry there were a lot of people nipping
at the edges (of the guidelines) and there was a minister who didn't believe
in them anyway,' Mr Mellor said.
Mr Mellor was being questioned about an internal memo sent to him by Mr
William Patey, a Foreign Office official who was chairman of the
interdepartmental committee responsible for vetting defence exports to Iraq
at the time.
Mr Patey told the inquiry in June that advice given by civil servants to
ministers on the export of machine tools in January 1988 was 'deficient' in
that it glossed over the extent to which they might contravene declared
policy.
The exports were approved after Whitehall had received intelligence that
Iraq was building up its arms manufacturing capability after signing
contracts with Matrix Churchill and other UK British machine-tool companies.
In further evidence to the Scott inquiry yesterday, Mr Mellor said that
during nine hours of talks he held with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and
his foreign minister Mr Tariq Aziz in Baghdad in February 1988, he had not
once raised British concerns about defence exports.
He said that the subject of arms sales had not been one 'you messed about'
with the Iraqis, as it might have compromised British intelligence sources.
Mr Mellor confirmed that he had approved a Whitehall memo in February 1988
naming Jordan as a country 'known or suspected' of diverting military
supplies to Iraq or Iran.
In written evidence to the inquiry earlier this summer, Mr Mellor said that
he could not recall having been made aware of third countries being used as
a route for British defence equipment to Iraq. Mr Robin Cook, Labour shadow
trade and industry secretary, said last night that as a result of the
inquiry 'the heat is being turned on ministers' as they face questioning
about the arms-for-Iraq affair.
'The evidence . . . has been swelling with every sitting,' Mr Cook said,
releasing a list of 'unanswered questions' for Mr William Waldegrave,
Foreign Office minister from July 1988 to November 1990, who gives evidence
today.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Pay squeeze 'could cost 200,000 jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 200,000 more jobs could be lost across the labour market during the
next financial year, the Trades Union Congress says in its analysis of the
government's new public-sector pay policy.
The document will be presented to today's emergency meeting of union leaders
representing Britain's 5.5m public-sector workers.
It says that the government's removal of up to Pounds 3bn from its
previously planned pay bill for 1994-95 will have an adverse effect on
employment. It suggests that the new pay policy will be 'even tougher' than
the government's present 1.5 per cent pay limit that expires in November.
The document suggests that another year of pay restraint will widen the gap
between public and private-sector pay levels, undermine the role of the
public-sector pay review bodies and damage recruitment and job motivation in
the public services.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Pounds 150m satellite deal takes BBC TV into Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday praised a Pounds 150m deal between BBC World Service
Television and Nissho Iwai, the Japanese trading group.
The prime minister said: 'From next spring, Japanese viewers will be able to
experience for themselves the excellence of BBC programmes specifically
tailored to their own interests.' He was speaking at a reception in Tokyo to
announce formally that BBC World Service Television would be launching its
24-hour news and information channel in Japan next year.
Talks have been going on for months with Nissho Iwai on launching the
channel which will be available 24-hours a day in English. There will be a
separate Japanese translation broadcast from London for four hours each
evening. The English and Japanese audio will be transmitted in stereo so
that viewers can choose how much of each language to hear.
The deal, worth Pounds 150m to BBC World Service Television over 10 years,
provides important finance for the service launched two years ago using
subscription funds raised from the BBC's entertainment satellite service in
Europe.
The launch was delayed because the government refused to provide any money
and said the BBC could not use licence money. Critics, such as Independent
Television News, say the service is subsidised by the licence fee because it
calls on BBC resources.
The deal increases the reach of World Service Television, which is available
on the Star satellite system in Asia broadcasting to 34 countries. The
service is also available in Europe, Africa and on cable television networks
in Canada.
In Japan, World Service Television will compete with Mr Ted Turner's Cable
News Network International which is already available on cable systems and
on satellite with segments of Japanese language programming.
The BBC service will be distributed and managed in Japan through Satellite
News Corporation, a company set up by Nissho Iwai. Revenue will come from
advertising and distribution to hotels, schools, offices and direct to
viewers.
The BBC said yesterday that it was also in discussions with prospective
partners in the US, South America, Australia and New Zealand.
Sky News, the satellite television channel, will be seen in Africa from the
beginning of next month.
The South African Broadcasting Corporation has agreed to transmit more than
12 hours a day.

DELEGATES responded to appeals by the party leadership not to press for a
recasting of trade policy to ensure a bigger market for the exports of
under-developed countries.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, MP for Gordon and trade spokesman in the Commons, said a
motion aimed at securing 'fair' rather than free trade would undermine the
party's position on the Genaral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Conference
voted to refer the motion to the federal policy committee.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Labour lays fresh claims of
'fascism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT council leader was proposed for election by a known
activist for the extreme right, Labour claimed yesterday, calling on Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, to extend his inquiry into
'Liberal-fascist links across London,' David Owen writes.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, published a copy of a 1990
nomination paper signed by a Mr Gary Russell for Mr Colin Beadle, a Hackney
Liberal Democrat leader. Mr Russell was 'a known activist in the fascist -
and now defunct - National Front,' Mr Straw said.
Mr Ashdown has said expulsions would follow if the inquiry he has ordered
establishes that Liberal Democrats in the Tower Hamlets area of London had
used racist tactics.
Mr Beadle reacted furiously to Mr Straw's use of his name, while a spokesman
for the Liberal Democrats last night called the allegations 'total
nonsense'.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Lib Dems split on energy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DILUTION of the party's commitment to an energy tax was approved yesterday
after a debate on environmental taxation dominated by concern about what the
plans could do to Liberal Democrat support in rural areas.
The move represents a slight setback for Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader,
who had hoped that the conference would accept without amendment the plans
to shift taxation on to pollution and the use of resources.
But the discussion revealed the split within the party over the impact of
the energy tax, particularly on people in rural communities who need to use
cars. It also highlighted concerns among Liberal Democrats themselves that
unless they were careful the plans might well resemble the government's
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, against which the party has
vigorously campaigned.
Party strategists fear that a debate on pensions tomorrow could also hand
the Conservatives a weapon. If the conference rejects plans to link the
future uprating of the state pension with prices rather than earnings, then
the party will be vulnerable to Tory charges that it would have to raise
taxes significantly to pay for the higher increases.
Yesterday, Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman, sought to
pre-empt another prospective Tory attack by emphasising that the energy tax
plans were 'revenue-neutral', and that the first call on the money raised
would be compensation for those most affected.
He said the paper, Taxing Pollution, Not People, was the base for further
discussion within the party and was only an interim statement of policy.
Even so, representatives insisted that the motion accepting the consultation
paper should not recommend that a carbon tax be implemented immediately.
They also resisted the idea of a tax which would be phased in more quickly
or have a wider base than the proposed EC tax.
As senior Conservatives stepped up their recent series of attacks on the
party, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Liberal
Democrats had shown themselves as 'shameless'. In a single debate they had
both attacked the government's VAT on fuel proposals and supported an energy
tax, he said.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Ashdown setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTY leader Mr Paddy Ashdown (above) was flatly rebuffed yesterday in his
ambitions to open up government to non-elected experts, Philip Stephens
writes.
The setback came as his close aides said the party intended to counter the
charge that it had become a 'one-man band' by raising the public profile of
its parliamentary representatives.
Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president; Mr Matthew Taylor, its
campaigns co-ordinator, and Mr Menzies Campbell, the defence spokesman, were
singled out as the principal beneficiaries of such a move as senior figures
acknowledged that most of the party's MPs are unknown outside their
constituencies.
Amid an undercurrent of concern that some of the party's representatives
needed to sharpen their presentation of key policies there were also
suggestions that Mr Ashdown may reshuffle the responsibilities of his
Westminster team. That put a question mark on Mr Alan Beith's long-term hold
on the economics portfolio.
Mr Ashdown's hopes of promoting a more pluralistic political establishment
by proposing that unelected individuals be allowed access to ministerial
office was rejected. He had backed a plan to reserve up to a third of
ministerial posts for appointees from outside Westminster.
But delegates shared the objection of a number of his colleagues that such a
move would undermine accountability. The leader was also accused privately
of relying on 'gimmicks' to raise the party's profile.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Bidders still in the dark over mines privatisation: Vital
questions remain about the British Coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tim Eggar, the energy minister, was being studiously vague yesterday
about his plans to privatise British Coal. Officially this is because
details will have to await the Queen's speech in November, but many
sensitive questions remain to be answered.
Chief among these is just how much of the company will be left to privatise.
In order to achieve a successful sale, British Coal will almost certainly
have to close more of its marginal deep pits, bringing the operating total
down from 30 to as few as 15.
The precise number will depend on how much additional coal the two large
power generators, National Power and PowerGen, will be willing to buy, over
and above their existing five-year contracts. However, they have huge stocks
 -33m tonnes at the latest count - and will be reluctant to buy more than
token amounts. So privatisation will mean further pit closures.
The government could help British Coal by requiring generators to hold
larger stocks, and by offering subsidies for additional coal sales. But
details of those plans have yet to emerge.
Mr Eggar was also vague about the kind of criteria he would use to decide
the winning bidders in next year's sale. Will they be strictly commercial
criteria, or would a commitment to save jobs earn a bidder extra brownie
points?
'We will look at bids on their merits and make a judgment about those
issues,' he said. 'Our aim is to achieve the largest economically viable
coalmining industry in the longer term.'
This may not be enough to satisfy potential bidders. 'I'd like to learn a
lot more about what type of evaluations they will apply,' said Mr Crispian
Hotson, chief executive of Ryan International, one of the private-sector
mining companies expected to make an offer.
Another unresolved question surrounds the extent of the liabilities that
purchasers would have to take on. It is expected that British Coal's past
liabilities - for example for subsidence - will be assumed by the
government, along with commitments to protect pensions and miners' rights to
free coal. Successful bidders would take on new liabilities. Mr Eggar
declined to give any numbers yesterday.
However, the uncertainties are not likely to dampen the appetite of
potential bidders. Apart from Ryan, these will include Coal Investments, a
new company set up by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former commercial director of
British Coal, and RJB Mining, recently floated on the Stock Exchange. A
number of management buy-outs are also being prepared, including those led
by trade unions such as the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and BACM, the
mine managers' union.
Some of them, such as BACM, will want to bid for all five parcels on offer,
believing that a large company stands the strongest chance of success.
Others will only bid selectively.
Parcels containing a mix of deep and open-cast mines are likely to be most
attractive because open-cast provides cleaner coal and lower costs. The
Yorkshire area is likely to be the least attractive because of its dominance
by Mr Arthur Scargill's National Union of Mineworkers.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: The centre may not hold -
Conference Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CENTRE of gravity in British politics is shifting. For most of the
Thatcherite 1980s Labour and Liberal Democrats spent their time chasing the
Conservatives to the right. The name of the opposition game now is to occupy
and remodel the centre ground.
The most striking feature of this week's Liberal Democrat conference has
been the self-conscious shift leftwards. A party which fought the last
general election on a set of market-driven economic assumptions scarcely
distinguishable from those of Mrs Thatcher has suddenly re-discovered a role
for government in determining the country's prosperity.
Full employment - for long derided as the pipedream of unreconstructed
socialists - is suddenly an at least half-respectable political objective.
Liberal Democrats can again hold out the occasional olive branch to the
trades unions. A couple of years ago the party leadership was as
enthusiastic as the Conservatives about the privatisation of British Rail.
Now the talk is of refusing to be driven by outdated ideology.
You could say, of course, that Mr John Major started it all when he kidded
the right of the Tory party that he was really one of them. Three years on
Mr Kenneth Clarke is in command at the Treasury, Mr Michael Heseltine at
trade and industry and Mr David Hunt at employment. There could be no more
potent insult to the Thatcherite dispossessed.
Manufacturing industry counts again, restrictions on public-sector pay have
brought with them the whiff of 1970s-style incomes policies, the level of
public borrowing has snuffed out talk of anything but the most transparently
token cut in income tax this side of the next general election.
Conservatives have once again been heard uttering such words as 'community'.
There is more than that. The Conservative right is in ideological disarray.
The rows over Europe and the exchange rate mechanism have sown as much
confusion among the disgruntled on the Tory backbenches as in Mr Major's
government.
It is little wonder that the real thinkers on the right - Mr Michael
Portillo the most prominent among them - are in a state of quiet despair.
The shift should not be exaggerated. Much of the Thatcher revolution has
been absorbed by the nation's political fabric. Weak unions, the replacement
of state direction with a presumption in favour of competition and
enterprise with state control, and disavowal of crude demand management have
become part of the consensus.
So much so, there is concern among both the Labour and Liberal Democrat
leaderships that the Tories' troubles will tempt their parties back into
their bad old ways. Mr Tony Blair, the most eloquent advocate of
modernisation in the Labour shadow cabinet, is battling fiercely against a
resurgence of the one-more-heave-tendency within his party at Westminster.
Mr Paddy Ashdown also faces a growing mood among his party's activists to
abandon the fiscal responsibility of the 1980s in favour of spending pledges
for pensioners, schoolteachers and health-service workers.
There is another dimension. The political scene is still suffering the
aftershocks of a deep and unusually indiscriminate recession.
It will take years of resumed growth before it is possible to judge whether
the unprecedented disenchantment of the electorate with politics and its
practitioners runs deeper than the disillusion invariably triggered by
recession.
Mr Ashdown is convinced it does. His premise this week has been that the
mood of anti-politics reflects not only the failure by the nation's leaders
to deliver the substance of politics - economic prosperity, decent public
services and a fair distribution of wealth and income. Voters will not be
reconciled with their representatives until the processes and structures of
politics have been radically overhauled.
Hence the Liberals' constant pre-occupation with constitutional change. It
is an understandable - perhaps unavoidable - strategy for a third party
which depends for power on change and has anyway to differentiate its
product from that of two entrenched competitors.
Changes in the political process though are no substitute for the more
mundane but far more immediate issues on which the voters judge politicians.
The right in British politics has lost its way. The opposition parties will
never have a better chance to recapture the initiative. Whether they can
seize the opportunity is another question.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Radical agenda set for reform
of constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN would no longer have the power to appoint the prime minister under
a programme for radical constitutional change approved by the conference
yesterday.
Delegates voted overwhelmingly for a wide-ranging motion stipulating that
the prime minister should be elected by an overall majority of the House of
Commons. It also called for the abolition of the royal prerogative which
enables the Queen, acting on the advice of her ministers, to declare war or
sign treaties with foreign governments without the prior approval of
parliament.
While postponing to next year a debate on whether the monarchy should be
abolished, the conference voted to change the law governing the right of
succession to the throne. The Liberal Democrats want to allow the eldest
child of the reigning monarch - whether male or female - to succeed to the
throne. Another change approved by the conference would permit a Roman
Catholic to assume the throne.
Calls for the introduction of referendums which would be binding on
parliament were defeated, but delegates agreed that there should be advisory
referendums.
Newly created regional assemblies, local councils and, as at present,
parliament would be able to stage referendums on controversial issues.
Provision was also made for citizens' referendums to be held when called for
by a stipulated number of voters. Other fundamental changes included in the
programme for were:
A new bill of rights entrenched with a written constitution and upheld by a
Supreme Court.
Home rule for Scotland and Wales, and regional assemblies in England. An
elected second chamber to replace the House of Lords representing Britain's
regions and nations.
The reformed chamber to include a minority of unelected non-voting members
chosen to reflect wider expertise and experience.
The introduction of the single transferable vote system of proportional
representation for all elections.

FT  22 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Letters on BAe jet venture are leaked

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION politicians in Taipei have leaked letters from Mr John Cahill,
chairman of British Aerospace, to a Taiwanese minister in an attempt to show
that a joint venture to build regional jet aircraft is politically, rather
than commercially, motivated, write Daniel Green in London and Dennis
Engbarth in Taipei.
Mr Cahill is due to meet today both Vice-Premier Hsu Li-teh and Mr Chiang
Ping-kun, whose economic affairs ministry is sponsoring Avro Aerospace
International, the joint venture between BAe and Taiwan Aerospace (TAC).
The leaked letters, from Mr Cahill to Mr Chiang, are dated August 13 and 16.
They threatened to abandon the joint venture if its funding problems were
not resolved. One suggested that the Taiwanese government should 'simply . .
. have instructed the (state-run) Chiao Tung Bank to provide (the) working
capital needed'.
Mr Cahill suggested in the letters that both TAC and the Chiao Tung Bank
were 'not proceeding in good faith' and threatened to call a press
conference to call the deal off.
The problem of financing the deal was resolved a fortnight later after
further negotiations in Taipei.
The venture is part of BAe's efforts to improve its profitability. The RJ
series of regional jet passenger aircraft, which would be built partly in
Taiwan, loses money for BAe. The venture would also provide a route for
Taiwan to enter the passenger aircraft industry.

<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for congressional passage of the North American Free Trade
Agreement diminished yesterday when Mr Dick Gephardt, House majority leader,
announced his opposition to the pact, Our Foreign Staff writes.
'No Nafta is preferable to a deficient Nafta,' he said. Because the current
pact did not address Mexico's low-wage levels its passage would increase
downward pressure on US wages.
He acknowledged that, with or without the pact, the US would lose well-paid
jobs to Mexico, but believed Nafta would increase the pace of plant
departures.
Mr Gephardt, whose influence is vital to the passage of Clinton
administration initiatives such as healthcare and campaign reform, stopped
short of suggesting the pact be sent back to the White House for
renegotiation.

THE EC decision not to reopen the Blair House deal on farm subsidies with
the US was greeted with relief by trade negotiators, who said the way was
now clear to complete the Uruguay Round of world trade talks by the end of
the year.
'On balance, the outcome must be positive for the Round,' said one trade
diplomat. 'The EC has avoided a crisis, and there was no commitment to back
down from the Blair House accord.'
The farm trade agreement, although it has not yet been extended to all 116
nations taking part in the Round, underpins crucial negotiations taking
place in Geneva on opening markets to imported farm goods. These talks are
seen as vital to acceptance of the Uruguay Round package by a large number
of agricultural exporting nations, especially in Latin America.
Diplomats discounted threats from Paris that a veto might again be
brandished if Washington fails to respond adequately when Sir Leon Brittan,
EC trade commissioner, presents French concerns to his US counterpart, Mr
Mickey Kantor, next week.
'I think people now have an interest in letting the Geneva negotiations
continue,' said one, pointing out that some 'clarifications and additions'
as demanded by the French could well come through the process of
'multilateral-ising' the Blair House agree-ment.
Elsewhere, negotiators have reported 'very good progress' in talks on
improving market access for services.
For goods, progress has been slower but countries are 'fully engaged'.

FT  22 SEP 93 / World Trade News: French coaxed back into farm trade fold -
Gunsmoke has cleared but EC divisions remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE's long-running campaign to secure a more favourable deal on farm
exports in the Gatt world trade talks may have been decided in a brief but
explosive encounter in the early hours of yesterday morning. Around
midnight, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief negotiator, tore into a proposed
Franco-German draft seeking 'clarifications' on the EC-US Blair House
agreement limiting farm trade exports. Drawing on his skills as a former
barrister, Sir Leon coolly picked apart the draft on the grounds that it
risked tying his hands in future negotiations with the US.
The intervention provoked a furious reaction from Mr Alain Juppe, French
foreign minister. He reminded Sir Leon - a former UK cabinet minister - that
he was a mere 'official' who would kindly take his orders from the assembled
EC ministers in the Gatt trade negotiations.
Around 4am, after more than 12 hours of talks between 35 EC foreign, farm
and trade ministers, Sir Leon emerged with a second compromise agreement
which he said had cleared the air. 'I hope we can now avoid the atmosphere
of drama and crisis, returning to the Gatt to the humdrum plain of normal
negotiations. The atmosphere of the OK Corral has disappeared.'
A judgment on the outcome of the crisis talks depends on which of the two
gunslingers came out on top. The initial reaction in Brussels yesterday was
that Sir Leon had bettered Mr Juppe, though the victory is far from final.
In the run-up to the Monday 'jumbo' meeting of EC ministers, it was clear
that the Belgian presidency of the EC and the European Commission had one
goal in mind: to strike a face-saving compromise which appeared to give
credence to some French objections to the Blair House accord without,
however, seeking a formal reopening of the agreement which could tie Sir
Leon's hands in negotiations in other unresolved Gatt areas such as market
access, textiles, steel and intellectual property.
It was always going to be a tricky balancing act. Not only have the French
in recent months made opposition to Blair House a cornerstone of their trade
policy, but they have also raised the threat of a veto of the final Gatt
agreement which the EC, US and other major trading nations hope to conclude
by the December 15 deadline.
The Blair House agreement provides for subsidised farm exports to be cut by
21 per cent in volume over six years; the value to be reduced by 36 per
cent; and internal price supports to be trimmed by up to 20 per cent. It was
agreed with great difficulty, and only after Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's
chief farm negotiator, had resigned temporarily because of alleged
interference from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
This same question of how far the EC's trade negotiators should be given
latitude to strike deals without having their hands tied by the member
states was the dominant issue in the Brussels talks.
The conclusions make clear that Sir Leon should be able to retain his room
for manoeuvre. It makes no mention of a new negotiating mandate to re-open
Blair House; and it only calls for him to follow the Council's
'orientations' in raising with the Americans a number of (largely French)
complaints about the contents of Blair House. These include a number of
requests:
An extended peace clause to prevent the US from taking unilateral action
against the EC's farm export regime.
Whether to include food mountains and cereal substitutes as part of the
export cuts package A mechanism to ensure that the EC can take advantage of
growth in world markets, particularly Asia.
A 'safeguard' clause which would help to protect the EC against surges in
cheap food imports.
So-called 'front-loading' which might allow the French and other farm
exporters to delay some of the cuts in subsidised exports until some time
toward the end of the Blair House target date of 1997.
German, British and Commission officials said yesterday that Sir Leon was
under orders to raise these problems with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, whom he meets on September 27 in Washington; but this did
not amount to an instruct a formal renegotiation of Blair House.
'He only has to discuss these matters,' said one German official, 'if he
does not return with results, he does not have to keep going back and forth
to Washington.'
This interpretation does not square with Mr Juppe's interpretation. Speaking
on French radio yesterday, Mr Juppe said that if Sir Leon returned to the
next EC foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg empty-handed 'France will
not accept the Blair House accord such as it is.'
Viewed negatively, the renewed threat of a French veto suggests continuing
guerrilla warfare; but a more positive interpretation is that the Brussels
compromise offers Paris enough prospect of changes in Blair House to prevent
the country slipping into dangerous isolation. 'We kept them in the fold,'
said one senior EC diplomat. This presumes, of course, that the US will be
ready to compromise too, a prospect by no means clear in the light of the
weakness of the Clinton presidency and the strength of the US farm lobby.
Some EC officials warned yesterday of possible US counter-demands, further
dampening prospects of a Gatt deal by December 15.
Early this morning, Sir Leon played down this risk and urged all countries
to make additional tariffs offers to keep the Gatt talks on the track. It
remains a tough sell in the light of the continuing profound divisions
within the EC on trade.

<TEXT>
Toyota and Nissan, the Japanese carmakers, yesterday unveiled steep declines
in August export volumes, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
The drop, 19.1 per cent year-on-year at Toyota and 22.4 per cent at Nissan,
reflects the companies' increased output at overseas plants, as they seek to
sidestep the impact of the yen's rise on the price competitiveness of
vehicles made in Japan.

FT  22 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US sticks defiantly to hard line over pact
renegotiation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday showed no sign of backing away from an
increasingly hard line against reopening the US-EC Blair House farm trade
accord, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
A spokesman for Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said any attempt
to reopen the pact would be viewed 'with grave concern'. It was 'a painfully
wrought compromise in the first place' and even 'clarification' would be
unacceptable if it was a cover for renegotiation.
President Bill Clinton said last week at a press conference attended by Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, that the EC 'must resist
opening this hard-struck bargain'. Otherwise it would be 'standing in the
way of efforts to bring the Uruguay Round to a rapid and successful
conclusion'.
Nineteen US farm groups - most of which have been active advisers in the
Uruguay Round negotiations - last week asked the president 'to make clear to
the European Community that the commitments made by both parties at Blair
House are not negotiable'. They also asked him to press for 'a significant
expansion' of market access during the concluding phase of Gatt
negotiations.
Ironically, it was Mr Kantor who first talked about opening up the Blair
House pact, because he thought US farmers had got a bad deal. The farm
lobbyists - including the American Farm Bureau, the National Association of
Wheat Growers, and the National Corn Growers - are now insisting the Blair
House accords 'represent minimal commitments on the part of the EC to reduce
its trade distorting export subsidies, restrain surplus oilseed production
and maintain zero-duty access for non-grain feed ingredients'.
There is increasing bitterness among US business lobbyists against the
French and a perception that the US is being blamed for a December 15 Gatt
deadline, which coincides with expiry of the US's fast-track negotiating
authority. The deadline was agreed after close consultation with US trading
partners and Gatt officials, they say.
One strategist recommended the US 'multilateralise' its response by calling
a meeting of farm exporting countries in favour of farm trade
liberalisation. 'The US must not allow itself to be dragged into another
US-EC confrontation,' he said.
Some US farm lobbyists have noted that the French position is not
significantly different from Mr Clinton's strategy to make more acceptable
the North American Free Trade Agreement by negotiating labour and
environmental side agreements.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Rabin faces MPs' vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday turned a parliamentary
debate on the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord into a vote of
confidence in his government.
Facing desertion by a ultra-orthodox religious coalition partner which is
demanding a referendum on the peace accord, he sought to rally parliamentary
support at the opening of a stormy two-day debate. A vote on the agreement
is due tonight and is expected to give Mr Rabin a wafer-thin majority.
'After 100 years of violence and terror, after wars and suffering there is
today a great prospect for a new chapter in the history of the state of
Israel,' Mr Rabin told MPs in a speech constantly interrupted by heckling.
'I call on you to give us a chance to exploit this great opportunity. Let
the sun rise.'
Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud party, said the prime
minister had thrown away the security of Israelis and called for new
elections. Demonstrators opposed to the peace agreement gathered outside the
Knesset (parliament).
Mr Rabin can count on at least a 61-59 majority for the peace agreement but
such a narrow victory might force the government to accept popular demands
for a referendum. However, this was rejected by Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's
foreign minister, who said: 'I feel more comfortable with 61 and having
peace than with 59 and losing peace.'
Frances Williams adds: Between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 12bn will be needed
in external resources over the next 10 years to rehabilitate the economies
of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, according to preliminary estimates by
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Unctad's estimates of the cost of reviving the Palestinian economy, in a
report yesterday to its executive board, range from Dollars 3bn to Dollars
7bn for Gaza alone, depending on how many Palestinians might return to the
area, and another Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn for the West Bank. This is far
more than World Bank estimates of at least Dollars 3bn over 10 years for
both areas combined.

<TEXT>
GUNMEN killed a leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation mainstream
Fatah faction in the Gaza Strip yesterday, AP reports from Gaza. The
shooting came during a rally celebrating the recent agreement between Israel
and the PLO, hospital officials said.
It was the first assassination since the PLO and Israel signed an agreement
September 13, handing over Gaza and Jericho to Palestinian self-rule within
four months.
Mohammed Abu Shaban, 35, was shot dead as he left the rally, Arab reports
said. Two cars filled with masked men forced his car off the road and killed
down in a hail of bullets when he stepped out to see what was happening.
Leaders of Palestinian groups opposing the agreement have vowed to sabotage
it by violence, and have threatened the life of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
leader.
But Arab reports said Abu Shaban might have been the victim of rivals within
his own Fatah group, rather than Moslem fundamentalists opposing the accord.
Abu Shaban, who led the political committee in Gaza advising the Palestinian
negotiators to the 23-month-old Middle East peace talks, was a popular
figure known for his charity work in the area. Since the PLO-Israeli
agreement was announced two weeks ago, he led the organisation of
pro-agreement rallies.

The Hong Kong government yesterday designated Mrs Anson Chan as the
territory's next chief secretary. She is the first Chinese appointment to
the administration's most senior position, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong.
The appointment will allay some concerns over the government's commitment to
introducing more Hong Kong Chinese into the upper echelons of its
administration and civil service. There had been an uproar over moves to
allow expatriate civil servants to extend contracts by switching to local
terms. She will replace Sir David Ford in November. He was chief executive
secretary for six and a half years, and will become commissioner in the Hong
Kong government's office in London. Mrs Chan was born in Shanghai but has
spent most of her life in Hong Kong and has worked within the government
since 1962. Mr Chris Patten, the governor, yesterday described her as 'a
real fighter for the livelihood and interests of Hong Kong'.

TOTAL REVENUES to the Olympic movement, from the sale of television rights
and sponsorships, were Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.23bn) in 1989-92 and
projections for the next four years, which cover the Lillehammer and Atlanta
Games, show an increase to nearly Dollars 2.5bn, the International Olympic
Committee said yesterday in disclosing details of its financial standing for
the first time, writes Keith Wheatley in Monte Carlo.
The Lausanne-based IOC has assets of Dollars 125m and received an average
annual income for its own use of Dollars 39m over the latest period. In its
first-ever annual report Mr Francois Carrard, chief executive, says that
less than 7 per cent of gross income is retained by the IOC to fund
administration. The remainder is distributed to Games organising committees,
national Olympic committees and individual sports federations.
Yesterday the IOC, meeting in Monaco where it will choose the site of the
2000 Games, agreed to establish an independent Olympic Foundation.
Lausanne's Olympic Museum, opened in June, and other assets worth up to
Dollars 74m will be transferred to the foundation by the end of this year.

FT  22 SEP 93 / New constitution for Cambodia: The move which signals the
departure of the UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMBODIA'S parliament yesterday adopted a new democratic constitution,
signalling the imminent end of the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) United Nations
peacekeeping mandate in the country and the return to the throne of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk.
The 70-year-old Prince Sihanouk is expected to fly to Cambodia from his home
in Beijing tomorrow to promulgate the constitution. He will become king for
the first time since he abdicated to enter politics in 1955, and will then
appoint the leaders of the new government.
'This is a great success for the Cambodian people and the international
community,' said Prince Ranariddh, Prince Sihanouk's son, after the
parliament voted by 113 to five, with two abstentions, in favour of the
constitution.
Prince Ranariddh's royalist party Funcinpec won the largest number of seats
in parliament in the UN-organised elections in May, and he will be the
senior of two prime ministers in the new government.
Many Cambodians, however, remain apprehensive about the future after more
than two decades of civil war. Not all of them are happy to see the soldiers
and officials of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) packing
their bags ahead of the departure of the last UN contingents in
mid-November.
As the constitution was being debated last week, Cambodian human rights
activists, western diplomats and Untac officials expressed concern about
whether human rights in general and the rights of racial minorities in
particular would in practice be safeguarded, and whether it would be
possible to create an independent judiciary. Untac is holding four prisoners
accused of murder and torture and the interim government has so far refused
to take them over and put them on trial.
There are also fears that Prince Sihanouk will be unable to resist
involvement in politics, although he is supposed to be a figurehead
according to the constitutional monarchy adopted yesterday, and although he
says he may have prostate cancer.
Another concern is that Funcinpec and the Cambodian People's party (CPP),
the former ruling communist party installed by Vietnam in 1979, will find it
difficult to remain in a coalition government.
The interim coalition appears to be working fairly smoothly at the
ministerial level in the capital Phnom Penh, and Mr Hun Sen, the former CPP
prime minister, has agreed to be junior prime minister under Prince
Ranariddh in the new government.
But CPP hardliners, who are powerful in the provinces and the security
services, are unhappy about their loss of influence since the election.
Under the old CPP one-party government, there was little distinction between
the property of the state and the property of the party. The Finance
Ministry, under Mr Sam Rainsy of Funcinpec, is taking an inventory of all
public assets.
The government's lack of control has been underlined by a rash of armed
robberies to seize equipment from Untac and foreign aid organisations. Untac
has lost 170 cars so far, and some have been found in the possession of
Cambodian army and police officers.
Such lawlessness may spread: Untac, after three months of payments costing
Dollars 13m, will now stop funding the salaries of some 140,000 soldiers and
police.
Meanwhile, Cambodia is expected to reach agreement with the International
Monetary Fund for a Dollars 9m short-term loan to help the transformation
from a communist to a market economy, and with the World Bank for a further
Dollars 64m, the finance minister said. Multilateral and bilateral lenders
and donors have pledged a total of Dollars 1bn in aid to Cambodia since
mid-1992.
Perhaps the best news for the Cambodian government is the recent weakening
of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla army, which boycotted the election but is
nevertheless demanding a share of power. Government officials say about
1,300 Khmer Rouge frontline troops, or a tenth of the organisation's
fighting force, have defected in recent weeks after a government offensive
in which the CPP-dominated army was aided by Funcinpec soldiers - who were
once allies of the Khmer Rouge.
Defectors have given Cambodian and Untac officials valuable information
about Khmer Rouge strategy and damning evidence of Thailand's support for
the Khmer Rouge in violation of the 1991 Paris peace accords which created
Untac and provided for the election.
For Mr Pol Pot, the reclusive Khmer Rouge leader, few television images can
have been more galling than that of Prince Ranariddh, his former ally, and
Mr Hun Sen, his former enemy, walking together out of parliament yesterday
to form a national government in which he has no part.

Mr Fraser also said that he believed that official interest rates might have

activity picking up and the exchange rate lower. 'All this suggests the long
phase of reductions in short-term interest rates is coming to an end', he
concluded. Mr Fraser's remarks come after several weeks of battering for the
Australian dollar, during which the Bank has intervened to support the

BETWEEN Dollars 7bn and Dollars 12bn will be needed in external resources
over the next 10 years to rehabilitate the economies of the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank, according to preliminary estimates by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development.
Among the priority needs of the area identified by Unctad are immediate
action to revive activity in the Gaza Strip, where half the workforce is
unemployed, as well as extensive investment in infrastructure, health and
education, an overhaul of the tax and finance systems and establishment of
an efficient and effective public administration.
Unctad's estimates of the cost of reviving the Palestinian economy, in a
report yesterday to its executive board, range from Dollars 3bn to Dollars
7bn for Gaza alone, depending on how many Palestinians might return to the
area, and another Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn for the West Bank.
This is far more than World Bank estimates of at least Dollars 3bn over 10

FT  22 SEP 93 / UK finds success in Malaysia: Background to Major's visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEN YEARS ago Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, piqued at what
he perceived to be British high-handedness on issues ranging from trade
matters to increased fees for Malaysian students studying in Britain,
instituted a 'Buy British Last' policy.
When Mr Major, the UK prime minister, meets Malaysia's leaders today during
his official visit to the country he will find attitudes very much changed.
Malaysia is now one of the success stories in Britain's overseas trade and
investment drive. Aside from the mainly transshipment traffic through
Singapore, Malaysia is Britain's biggest export market in the South-East
Asia region.
Britain's exports to Malaysia have nearly trebled in value in the last five
years, reaching Pounds 636m last year. In the first three months of this
year Britain became the leading foreign investor in Malaysia, putting Pounds
122m into a variety of projects.
Malaysia's exports to Britain have also been growing strongly, reaching
Pounds 1.1bn last year. Its economy has been growing at more than 8 per cent
in each of the last five years. The country is industrialising fast.
Malaysia's exports to Britain are no longer confined, as in the old colonial
days, to the more traditional goods, such as rubber and tin. The
manufacturing sector is now leading the country's export drive. Up to April
1993, Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer, had exported nearly 57,000 of
its cars to Britain, where it has become a popular low-priced model.
The improvement in British-Malaysian trade was in large part due to the
close relationship through the 1980s between Dr Mahathir and Mrs Margaret
Thatcher.
Dr Mahathir espouses many of the beliefs - and an amount of the leadership
style - of the former British prime minister. Mrs Thatcher, on a private
visit to Kuala Lumpur this month, received red carpet treatment and, in
return, was effusive in her praise for Dr Mahathir.
The big breakthrough for Britain in Malaysia came in 1988 with the signing
of a memorandum of understanding on defence. Since then Britain has made
Pounds 1.3bn of defence sales to Malaysia, including 28 Hawk trainer
aircraft and two frigates. British officials calculate civil projects have
been worth another Pounds 1bn in British exports.
But bigger prizes are still to be won: Power projects. To keep pace with
expected economic growth, Malaysia's power output, now about 5,000MW, needs
to grow five times over the next 25 years. The government calculates that in
the next 10 years alone MDollars 40bn (Pounds 10.3bn) needs investing in the
power sector.
To alleviate the financial burden, Malaysia is encouraging private sector
participation in its power industry. A multi-million-pound independent power
producer (IPP) project involving a British company is expected to be
announced during Mr Major's visit.
National Power, the British electricity company, recently withdrew from an
IPP project because of contractual differences with the local company
involved. However other UK companies such as John Brown, British Gas, Rolls
Royce/NEI and the National Grid continue to win substantial amounts of
business.
A new international airport outside Kuala Lumpur is scheduled for completion
before the city hosts the Commonwealth Games in 1998. An Anglo-Japanese
consortium which includes GEC, Gammon and Balfour Beatty (BB is also lead
contractor in a Pounds 350m hydroelectric scheme in peninsular Malaysia) is
hoping for a large share of the work in the Pounds 2bn airport project.
However, Malaysia is pressing for substantial concessionary finance from
Britain.
It has also signalled it wants other trade-offs - such as more British
landing rights for Malaysia Airlines, the national carrier.
Other infrastructure sectors in which British companies are pursuing
business include upgrading Malaysia's railway network, developing ports,
building private hospitals, and work in the country's rapidly expanding
telecommunications sector.
Both Shell and BP are involved in petrochemicals projects, while North West
Water is finalising negotiations on its 25 per cent stake in a Pounds 1.5bn
project to privatise the country's sewerage system.
As elsewhere, Britain faces tough competition in winning contracts ahead of
Japan and, more recently, Germany and France.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Major stresses Asian priority for Britain: Kevin Brown on
Britain's role as 'best friend'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MR John Major moved on yesterday from Japan to Malaysia, it was clear
that the fuss in the UK over his leadership has obscured an important shift
of emphasis in British relations with Asia.
The UK prime minister went out of his way during the trip to stress the
government's determination 'to give Asia a new place in our national
priorities,' and even spoke of a 'special relationship' with Japan - a
phrase historically associated with the US.
'Until the 1980s,' Mr Major said at a dinner with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
Japan's prime minister, 'we in Britain were frightened of your surging
economic might.' Now, he said, the old barriers were down.
At times, Mr Major's enthusiasm for things Japanese exceeded that of his
hosts. He suggested, for example, that Japan could become a permanent member
of an expanded United Nations Security Council as soon as it wished.
The suggestion reflected Britain's increasing sympathy for Japanese
international aspirations. Perhaps it was not Mr Major's fault that it was
delivered at the very time that Japan is toning down its campaign for
security council membership because of domestic opposition by pacifists.
Nevertheless, Mr Major made his point. In case anyone should misunderstand,
the message was rammed home by the highest-powered business delegation ever
to leave British shores - including senior executives of a dozen leading
companies such as GEC, British Telecom, British Gas, Rolls-Royce and Cable &amp;
Wireless.
Part of the presentation problem faced by the British party was that there
were no attention-grabbing contracts to be announced, in contrast to Mr
Major's last such trip, to India. Nevertheless, the trade element of the
visit was judged more of a success than the much larger trade mission to
Japan led last year by then US President George Bush, which was widely
regarded as too large and overly aggressive.
For example, Rolls-Royce, which powers most of Japan's maritime self-defence
force, said the trip had provided a useful opportunity to lobby for an order
worth up to Pounds 1.2bn over 20 years to supply engines for Japan Air
Lines' new fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft.
There were also signs of movement on improved access to the Japanese market
for Britain's insurance, financial services and legal sectors. Guinness, the
drinks group, said it hoped the trip would increase pressure on Japan to
honour its Gatt commitment to equalise excise duties on domestic and
imported spirits.
The Japanese were pleased, too, by the British party's enthusiasm for inward
investment and the prime minister's rejection of managed trade as a solution
to the Pounds 5bn trade gap between the two countries. Mr Major's message
that multilateral trade is 'good for everyone' was welcomed by Japan, as was
his trenchant criticism of Washington's position on sectoral trading targets
in US-Japan framework talks taking place in Hawaii.
Mr Major was also given private assurances by Mr Hosokawa that Japan will
seek to assist completion of the Uruguay round of Gatt negotiations in spite
of the domestic political difficulties in liberalising its closed rice
market.
The friendly tone of the talks reflects in part the ideological
compatibility of the British government and its six-week-old Japanese
counterpart on issues such as deregulation, which both have made a policy
priority.
Underpinning the mutual warmth is an increasingly close economic
relationship, which has more than doubled two-way trade from less than
Pounds 5bn in 1984 to Pounds 9.7bn last year.
However, the key element in the relationship is Japan's growing direct
investment in the UK, which amounts to 40 per cent of such investment in the
European Community. Mr Major made clear to the Japanese that Britain has
none of the reservations about inward investment which have created tensions
between Tokyo and Washington. Indeed, he lavished praise on the Japanese car
factories in Britain, which he said had 'changed the way we work'.
Mr Major did not say so, but businessmen and officials travelling with his
party left little doubt Britain's objective is to cement its position as
Japan's 'best friend' in the Community - a role that Tokyo appears content
for London to play.
Mr Major left open the details of how Britain's putative closer relationship
with the rest of Asia will work, limiting himself to an offer to use British
security council membership, military expertise and 'experience of conflict
resolution' to assist Asian friends. Fittingly, however, for the leader of a
country emerging from a serious recession, Mr Major's objectives appear to
be largely trade-related.
'Already in the Asia-Pacific, Britain is the largest European investor, the
largest European exporter of invisibles, and the second largest European
exporter of goods. We shall do better,' he said.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Muted welcome for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE business leaders gave a muted welcome to yesterday's three-quarter
percentage point cut in official interest rates.
The cut, the seventh since early 1991, brings the Bank of Japan's official
discount rate from 2.5 per cent to a new low of 1.75 per cent, a quarter of
a point below what the markets had been expecting. It follows last week's
Y6,150bn (Pounds 38.7bn) package of government spending.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, central bank governor, said he saw no sign of a recovery
in domestic demand, but the rate cut should help return the economy to a
'non-inflationary sustainable growth track'. Senior industrialists welcomed
the cut but doubted whether it would be enough to revive the economy and
repeated calls for income tax cuts.
The coalition government is divided on income tax reductions, which are
being studied by an official panel as part of a general reform of the tax
system. The administration plans to consider a fiscal stimulus only if the
economy remains stagnant by the end of the year.
The Keidanren, the economic federation and leading mouthpiece for the
business community, would evaluate the rate cut, said Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, its
chairman. The move showed the bank realised the economy was in a worse state
than it at first thought, he said.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' organisation, said
he was unsatisfied with the size of the cut; there was room for more. The
Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association agreed: it warned that an
interest rate cut alone was not enough to stave off fears of a double-dip
recession.
Officials from the steel, electrical machinery and precision instrument
industries added that they could only increase capital investment if they
government took steps to stimulate personal consumption.
Household spending fell for the third month running in July, because of cool
weather and a decrease in summer bonuses, said the Management and
Co-ordination Agency. Average July spending was, in real terms, 2.3 per cent
below the same month in the previous year.
The only significant private sector welcome for the rate cut came from the
Zenginkyo bankers' federation, whose chairman, Mr Tadashi Okuda, said it
should have a great psychological effect.
Analysts doubted that the cut would have a big impact on borrowing costs,
since rates on three-month certificates of deposit, at which commercial
banks lend to each other, have already fallen since early August.
The Bank of Japan is expected to try to nudge market rates down again to
encourage a drop in the prime rate, on which commercial banks base their
lending to business. 'At least this takes monetary policy off the plate for
the next six months. It means that taxes will now be the focus of interest,'
said Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia.
Share and bond prices rose slightly as a result of the move, with the Nikkei
index up 200.62 points to 20,466.65.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Japan to ask US to curb budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MORIHIRO HOSOKAWA, Japan's prime minister, plans to ask the US to curb
its budget deficit and improve industrial competitiveness when he meets
President Bill Clinton next Monday.
He told parliament in a policy speech yesterday: 'Our country will strive to
achieve non-inflationary economic growth based on domestic demand and
improve access to its markets. At the same time, (Japan) will ask the US to
cut its budget deficit and boost its international competitive edge.'
Mr Hosokawa will meet the US president for their first summit after
addressing the United Nations general assembly in New York. This will be
scrutinised closely by the Japanese public as the first test of the new
prime minister's statesmanship and his ability to stand up to the US.
Relations between Washington and Tokyo are becoming sensitive again as they
enter the second week of talks on trade and economic co-operation, clouded
by a fresh spate of scandals over alleged bid-rigging in Japan's
construction industry.
His speech, Mr Hosokawa's second policy statement in the Diet, the lower
house of parliament, was designed to set the tone for a 90-day special
session to debate political reform, due to end on December 15. He repeated
his pledge to push through plans to reform the corruption-prone political
system by the end of the year and to pursue plans to reform Japan's
administration and deregulate the economy.
He used the occasion to underline the wider importance of political reform
to Japan's place in the world. 'Japan has been beset with the scandal of
political corruption virtually every year and the spectacle of the Diet in a
frenzy trying to deal with these scandals has not only exacerbated distrust
of politics but even threatens to undermine Japan's international
credibility.'
On deregulation, he argued it was vital to pass on benefits of Japan's
economic power to ordinary people. Mr Hosokawa expressed the highest respect
for those who worked single-mindedly since the end of the war to achieve
economic and industrial growth.

FT  22 SEP 93 / US outlines blueprint for foreign policy: Clinton strategy
sees expansion of market democracies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is proposing a new US foreign policy strategy of
'enlargement', to replace the containment doctrine of the cold war years.
Mr Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser,
yesterday drew a blueprint of the strategy to expand the reach of democracy
and market economics.
'During the cold war even children understood America's security mission; as
they looked at those maps on their schoolroom walls they knew we were trying
to contain the creeping expansionism of that big, red blob,' Mr Lake said in
a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins
University in Washington.
'Today, at great risk of oversimplification, we might visualise our security
mission as promoting the enlargement of the blue areas of market
democracies.'
Mr Lake's speech, given before the latest crisis in Moscow erupted, is the
most elaborate articulation so far of the administration's vision of a
foreign policy for the post-cold war era.
He argued that while US efforts in Bosnia and Somali were 'important
expressions of our overall engagement', they did not by themselves define
the broader US strategy. The US, he said, still supported lifting the arms
embargo against Bosnia - a proposal rejected by its European allies - and
remained committed to helping implement an acceptable peace agreement.
'But while we have clear reasons to engage and persist, they do not
obliterate other American interests involving Europe and Russia, and they do
not justify the extreme costs of taking unilateral responsibility for
imposing a solution,' Mr Lake said.
Instead, he suggested, the first concern in the US's enlargement strategy
should be strengthening the core of market democracies in North America,
Europe and Japan.
The US should also seek to foster and consolidate democracy and market
economics, particularly in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe but
also in key countries which could influence an entire region, such as South
Africa or Nigeria.
Mr Lake said the US must isolate and, if necessary, strike back at the
states which combat democracy, especially those, such as Iran and Iraq,
which are regional powers.
Finally, he said the US must intervene in humanitarian crises, but warned
that few intra-national ethnic conflicts would justify military
intervention.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE HAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dutch government yesterday abandoned its target for cutting the 1994
budget deficit, because of slower economic growth and sharply rising
unemployment.
The 1994 budget, presented to parliament yesterday, calls for a budget
deficit equivalent to 3.9 per cent of net national income. This is unchanged
from this year, but above the 3.25 per cent target set in 1989.
The government also published projections showing that growth in gross
domestic product will be flat this year but should return to a rate of 1 per
cent growth in 1994.
Unemployment will rise this year and next, with 715,000 people expected to
be drawing unemployment benefit in 1994, a new post-war high. This is
equivalent to an unemployment rate of just over 10 per cent of the
workforce.
Total government spending will be reduced next year to Fl 198.7bn (Pounds
70.9bn) from a projected Fl 207.1bn in 1994. Slower economic growth will
cause state revenues to drop even more sharply to Fl 178.1bn from Fl 195.7bn
this year. Inflation is expected to fall to 2 per cent this year, from 3.3
per cent last year, but to rise to 3 per cent in 1994.

THE European Commission's controversial restructuring plan for the steel
industry could fail if Germany insists on subsidising new capacity at
Ekostahl in eastern Germany, warned Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry
commissioner, in Brussels yesterday.
Mr Bangemann was speaking after a meeting of EC industry ministers in which
the future of the east German plant emerged as the key remaining obstacle to
a resolution of the subsidies issue - which would clear the way for
restructuring to go ahead. Mr Bangemann said the Commission hoped to be able
to propose a 'reasonable' solution in the next two to three weeks for Ilva,
the state-owned Italian producer.
'We have already found a solution to the Spanish case,' said Mr Bangemann,
referring to the restructuring plan for the main Basque plants agreed by the
Commission, Madrid and the Basque government in recent weeks.
'It depends on the attitude of the German government as to whether we can
complete the package.'
Industry ministers need to approve settlements of all the three main subsidy
issues - Ilva, Ekostahl and CSI in Spain - before the private sector
steelmakers come forward with their own offers of capacity cuts.
The European Commission said it had opened an inquiry into a planned venture
between Germany's Mannesmann, Valtubes, a unit of France's Vallourec, and
Dalmine, a subsidiary of Italy's state steelmaker Ilva, to see whether
competition in the market would be badly damaged by the alliance, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
German steelmakers yesterday said they would appeal in the US Court of
International Trade against the US government's decision to impose stiff
dumping duties on steel products from 19 countries, writes Ariane Genillard
in Bonn.

HOUSING starts in the US rose 7.8 per cent between July and August,
indicating that the lowest mortgage interest rates for 20 years are
providing a powerful stimulus, writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
The increase was larger than analysts expected and took the level of starts
to an annual rate of 1.32m, the highest in more than three years.
The figures, published yesterday by the Commerce Department, came as Federal
Reserve governors and regional presidents met in Washington to review
monetary policy.
The central bank is not expected to signal an early change in short-term
rates, which have stood at 3 per cent (zero after allowing for inflation)
for more than a year.
Housing starts rose in all regions except the north-east. The strongest
sector of the market was starts of single-family homes, which rose 11 per
cent nationally to an annual rate of 1.18m, the highest in six years.

THE Institute of International Finance, which represents many large
commercial banks, yesterday called on the World Bank and regional
development banks to assume bigger risks in support of their lending to
private sector investment in the developing world, writes Peter Norman,
Economics Editor, in Washington.
Mr Charles Dallara, the IIF's managing director, said international
financing institutions should revise some of their lending rules to
encourage private capital flows. In a letter to Mr Philippe Maystadt,
Belgian finance minister and recently-elected chairman of the IMF's
policy-making interim committee, he suggested the World Bank and regional
developments banks should think again about their insistence that
governments in countries borrowing from them should guarantee all their
loans.
Mr Dallara also suggested the institutions should provide coverage of a
broader definition of political risk in countries such as Russia to attract
private capital.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S largest political party yesterday decided against pulling out of
the coalition government although it remained divided about its longer-term
links with President Itamar Franco.
Leaders of the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB) voted to
stay with the president when it became clear a small but powerful faction of
the party, led by Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, Sao Paulo governor, was
losing support in its call for a split with the government.
PMDB leaders decided that leaving the government would highlight the party's
own divisions and risked strengthening the hand of its main centre-left
rivals, the Brazilian Social Democratic party of finance minister Fernando
Henrique Cardoso.
The decision ends the immediate threat of a rupture between the PMDB and
President Franco, who angered the party by making appointments without
consulting it.
But the party remains torn over whether it should remain with an unpopular
government, especially with elections next year, or risk being blamed for
triggering instability by leaving the government without a congressional
majority.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Salinas brushes up Mexico's polls image: A look at attempts
to take the controversy out of elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas, who assumed power under a cloud of allegations of
electoral fraud, has made a last effort to dispel criticisms of Mexico's
political system and prepare the way for a clean and trouble-free
presidential ballot next year.
Last week, at his behest, Congress passed electoral laws that will set the
first-ever ceilings on campaign contributions, give independent electoral
observers formal status, make the electoral institutes more independent of
the government and regulate access to the media by the political parties.
The reforms are the last electoral changes before next August's presidential
ballot, in which President Salinas is barred from standing by the
constitution. They were passed by overwhelming majorities in both houses of
Congress after the government had made last-minute concessions to the
conservative National Action party (PAN), which had opposed the laws.
However, the reforms drew fire from the leftist Party of Democratic
Revolution (PRD), which has fought for more profound political changes and
abstained from voting. The PRD, like many independent observers, charged
that the new laws would do little to loosen the Institutional Revolutionary
party's 64-year grip on power.
Under the new laws, the supposedly non-partisan Federal Electoral Institute
(IFE) remains answerable to the interior ministry and will have the power to
set the limits on campaign spending. Next year, individual contributions to
a party will be limited to the equivalent of about Dollars 650,000 (Pounds
422,000) while associations will be allowed to give about five times that
amount. Such generous limits will work in favour of the PRI, which has close
ties with most of Mexico's wealthy businessmen.
While regulation of access to the media will ensure there is no formal
discrimination against the opposition buying advertisements, there is no
sign yet that the favourable light in which the government is treated on all
television networks will change.
The new owner of Mexico's recently privatised television networks has
expressed his admiration for President Salinas. In doing so, he is following
the pro-government line that has helped make Televisa, the main television
network, one of Mexico's most profitable companies and Latin America's
largest media concern.
The changes come after the government, among other measures, last month
agreed to double the number of Senate seats and, in a modest concession to
PAN, to permit the child of a foreign-born Mexican parent to be eligible for
the presidency. This latter reform will not take effect until 1999, so that
the PAN's most popular candidate, Mr Vicente Fox, who has a Spanish-born
parent, will not be able to run in next year's election.
President Salinas hailed the new laws as creating conditions for 'civil'
elections and reducing the 'perspective of tension'. Put together with the
changes passed earlier in his term, which included the drawing up of an
accurate electoral roll, they make a repetition of the 1988 election, when
fraud was widely reported, less likely.
Protests which followed that election and others, and complaints at massive
spending by the PRI and its control of much of the media, undercut the PRI's
legitimacy. This has become one of the side-issues surrounding the North
American Free Trade Agreement. Several US congressmen have voiced concern
about lack of democracy in Mexico and the issue is likely to be raised in
congressional hearings on the trade deal later this year.
However, with the PRD opposing the reforms and the PAN in two minds about
their merits, it is not certain that the laws will fulfil their function of
making Mexico's elections fully credible. While the government has brushed
aside the PRD's opposition to the reforms, its candidate in next year's
election, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is expected to be the most serious threat
to the PRI, as he was in 1988.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Low rates buoy US housing starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING starts in the US rose 7.8 per cent between July and August,
indicating that the lowest mortgage interest rates for 20 years are
providing a powerful stimulus.
The increase was larger than analysts expected and took the level of starts
to an annual rate of 1.32m, the highest in more than three years.
The figures, published yesterday by the Commerce Department, came as Federal
Reserve governors and regional presidents met in Washington to review
monetary policy.
The Fed faces conflicting pressures on interest rates.
Some economists are pressing for an early tightening of policy to curb rapid
growth of bank reserves and head off a speculative bubble in share and bond
prices. Senior administration officials, however, say that interest rates
must remain low in order to stimulate economic growth and job creation.
The Fed is not expected to signal an early change in short-term rates, which
have stood at 3 per cent (zero after allowing for inflation) for more than a
year. However, several senior officials, including Mr Alan Greenspan, the
chairman, have indicated real rates are well below 'equilibrium' levels.
Housing starts rose in all regions except the north-east. The strongest
sector of the market was starts of single-family homes, which rose 11 per
cent nationally to an annual rate of 1.18m, the highest in six years.
The surge last month followed disappointing figures earlier this year when
bad weather affected building in many regions. For the first eight months
starts were up only 3 per cent from the same period last year.
However, building permits - a guide to future construction - rose 16 per
cent in the year to August, suggesting continued market buoyancy.

FT  22 SEP 93 / World Bank 'should step up risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Institute of International Finance, which represents many of the world's
large commercial banks, yesterday called on the World Bank and regional
development banks to assume bigger risks in support of their lending to
private sector investment in the developing world.
Mr Charles Dallara, the IIF's managing director, said the international
financing institutions such as the World Bank should revise some of their
lending rules to encourage private capital flows.
In a letter to Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister and
recently-elected chairman of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making
interim committee, Mr Dallara suggested that the World Bank and regional
developments banks should think again about their insistence that
governments in countries borrowing from them should guarantee all of their
loans.
Mr Dallara also suggested that the institutions should provide coverage of a
broader definition of political risk in countries such as Russia to attract
private capital to large projects. Mr Dallara, who was a senior official at
the US Treasury and US executive director to the IMF in the 1980s, said such
changes were needed to support developing nations that were putting greater
emphasis in their policies on privatisation and private sector investment.
He called for the creation of a 'deputies working group' of senior officials
from IMF and World Bank member countries to work out plans for early changes
to the policies of the development banks and the Fund so that they would be
better able to mobilise private capital flows.
To some extent, the IIF is pushing on an open door. The International
Finance Corporation, a World Bank affiliate which promotes the private
sector in developing nations, is expanding its activities with particular
emphasis on encouraging private infrastructure investment in emergent market
economies.
But it is unlikely that his plea for the international financing
institutions to take on greater risk in support of private sector investment
will gain rapid support in the IMF or World Bank. Both bodies feel they are
running substantial risks already, especially in the former Soviet
republics.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Moslems say sea access agreed: Deal with Croats could clear
obstacle to Bosnian peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Moslem leaders yesterday said they had agreed with Croat leaders on
the crucial question of access to the sea for the Bosnian Moslem republic,
potentially clearing a big obstacle to a broader peace deal.
In Zagreb, Mr Haris Silajdic, Bosnian foreign minister, said the dispute
over access to the Adriatic had been resolved during secret talks between
Croat, Serb and Bosnian Moslem leaders on a British naval vessel in the
Adriatic on Monday.
But in an apparent blow to a rapid agreement, Bosnia's Moslem President
Alija Izetbegovic yesterday said he could not recommend acceptance of the
latest peace plan to end the republic's 17-month war.
'I personally am not inclined towards that proposal,' he said in Sarajevo.
'I think that the solution for access to the sea fits the needs of Bosnia in
an economic sense. . . But I am not satisfied with the territorial
solution.'
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international mediator, said however: 'We are
closer to a solution than at any time in the history of the negotiations.'
The Bosnian parliament is due next Monday to consider the peace plan, which
would create a loose 'union' of three ethnic mini-states.
The latest peace proposals includes four separate territorial agreements
between the Bosnian Moslem and Croat leaders, including a plan to give the
Bosnian state a port on the River Neretva near the village of Celjevo,
joined by an additional corridor and road to the Moslem state, and a 99-year
lease on a facility in the Croatian port of Ploce.
Mr John Mills, the mediators' spokesman, yesterday said the Bosnian Serbs
had also offered the Moslems extra land around the eastern enclaves,
although Moslem demands for land around the northeast enclave of Bihac had
apparently not been met. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, however,
played down Serb concessions.
Although the Moslems have repeatedly said the village of Neum should be
their port, the Croat leaders have resisted this, saying Moslem control of
Neum would leave the Croat port of Dubrovnik isolated.
However, as a sign of the pressure now mounting on Mr Izetbegovic to accept
an alternative, Mr Mills said that the talks had taken into account findings
which confirmed Neum would be ill-suited for a deep-water port.
The accord now envisages that part of Neum will be controlled by the
Moslems, with a joint Croat-Moslem authority to develop tourism in the area.
Meanwhile, heavy fighting was yesterday reported to be continuing in Central
Bosnia, in defiance of the latest ceasefire accord. Moslem troops were
reported to be advancing on Croat-held areas in the central Bosnian town of
Vitez, and on Mostar, further south.
And in a grim omen for winter, 10 people were reported to have died of
starvation in the central Bosnian town of Zenica, where some 150,000 Moslems
have been increasingly isolated by recent fighting between Moslems and
Croats.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Germany faces row on plan to cut holiday pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the German government coalition yesterday hit upon a new source
of cash to paper over cracks in their own unity: the holiday pay of German
workers, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
They came up with an extraordinary scheme to cut pay packets by 20 per cent
on each of 10 national holidays - such sacred days as Christmas, New Year's
Day, Easter Monday, May Day, and even the newly-created Day of German Unity
 -in order to help pay for a new pillar of the social state.
Their plan was received with instant incredulity in the labour movement, and
equally dismissed by employers as irrelevant. Trade unions promised to
complain direct to the supreme constitutional court.
The idea behind the plan is somehow to find a way of compensating German
employers for the cost of a new multi-billion D-Mark social insurance
scheme, intended to finance costs of home nursing care for the old and
handicapped.
In itself, the scheme is highly popular, which is why Chancellor Helmut Kohl
is seeking to push it through parliament before next year's elections. But
he cannot find any way of funding it which meets wide approval, either
within his own coalition, or across party lines, with the opposition Social
Democratic party (SPD). The latest financing plan, worked out late on Monday
by party experts, and agreed yesterday by leaders of the three-party
coalition, is supposed to replace an earlier plan to cancel sick pay for
workers for up to six days a year. That was totally abhorrent to the entire
labour movement.
Growth in broad money supply exceeded the Bundesbank's target range for the
fifth successive month in August, the German central bank reported
yesterday, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
However, the seasonally adjusted, annualised 7.2 per cent rate of growth in
M3 which comprises cash in circulation as well as savings and short-term
time deposits was lower than the 7.4 per cent rate in July and better than
many economists predicted.

<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of coal miners blockaded the threatened Bergkamen pit in Germany
yesterday after Ruhrkohle, the country's largest coal producer, announced
6,000 more job cuts, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
The company, which produces 80 per cent of west German coal, said it would
close down the Bergkamen pit and reduce production by two-thirds at two
other pits, from January 1994. The move aims to cut output by 3m tonnes of
coal and coking coal.
The latest cuts, bringing planned job losses to 18,000 by the end of 1994,
were caused by the worsening crisis in the steel industry, the company's
second-biggest customer after energy, Ruhrkohle said.
IG Bergbau, the miners union, said it would organise protests next month
before the company's supervisory board meets to ratify the decision,
expected in November.
'We have run out of space to store it and must reduce capacity,' the company
said.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Poor prospects seen for incomesin east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT will take 35 years for eastern European incomes to reach even half the
level of average western incomes under current predictions for economic
growth, Mr John Flemming, the chief economist at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, said yesterday.
His sober prediction came as the EBRD issued its annual economic outlook,
which examines the pace of economic reform in eastern Europe, four years
after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
With the economic fortunes of east European countries varying enormously,
the bank refrains from proscribing a single solution for transition to
market economies.
But with all east European countries experiencing a contraction in their
economies in the past three years, ranging from a fall in GDP of 19.4 per
cent in Georgia to 3.1 per cent in Belarus, the report warns that overall
recovery may be slower than previously hoped.
Although most economists agree that growth will resume in 1994, predictions
vary wildly, Mr Flemming said.
Ukraine, which some economists believe will see its GDP collapse by a
further 10 per cent next year, represents the gloomy end of the spectrum.
More optimistically, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are predicted to
have growth rates of around 4 per cent.
But since the economies of the OECD countries are forecast to grow by 2 per
cent, even 4 per cent growth in eastern Europe will not allow the region to
catch up with western Europe for many decades, Mr Flemming added.
'What is needed to close the gap is the growth we have seen in the Pacific
rim,' said Mr Flemming, citing China's economic growth rate of 10 per cent,
'but no one is predicting that type of growth in eastern Europe.'
Little fall is predicted in inflation levels, which run from the low 'teens'
in the 'success stories' such as Poland to 1,000 per cent in Russia.
As a result, the report suggests the punitively high levels of effective
marginal labour and capital tax rates create 'dismal prospects for private
investment. . . that have not been widely appreciated.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / Poland may get left-of-centre government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of a left-of-centre coalition government in Poland increased
yesterday after the Democratic Union, (UD), the mainstream Solidarity party,
said it would not join a coalition with either of the two victorious parties
with their roots in the communist past.
The UD leadership said it was the duty of the two parties that won the
election, the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasants party
(PSL), to form a government. 'These parties have aroused social expectations
which cannot be fulfilled, and we don't intend to join such a government,'
it said.
In response Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, giving his first
post-victory press conference, yesterday concluded: 'This means we will have
to start talks with the PSL and the Union of Labour (UP) on the possibility
of forming a coalition with them.'
The UP, led by Mr Ryszard Bugaj, won 7 per cent of the votes and around 42
seats, and although left-wing on many social issues, is deeply
anti-communist and unlikely to agree to an alliance which includes the SLD.
The SLD, with over 20 per cent of the vote and around 173 seats, and the PSL
with over 15 per cent of the vote and around 130 seats, together command a
'constitutional majority' of over two-thirds of the 460 seats in the Polish
Sejm, the lower house of parliament.
This not only gives them the opportunity to govern in coalition with each
other, but also gives them the power to dictate the terms of the new
constitution needed to replace the present interim 'Mala Konstytucja', or
small constitution.
One of the issues to be decided is the future division of powers between the
elected president and the parliament. Mr Kwasniewski denied yesterday that
the SLD intended immediately to cut powers enjoyed by President Lech Walesa
or his term in office, which runs until autumn 1995.
But he made clear the SLD would press for a future constitutional model in
which the president plays a less active political role, stepping in only
when needed as an arbiter. But he added: 'The constitutional question will
have to the subject of a broad-based debate in and outside parliament.'
Asked about what he had to say to foreign investors Mr Kwasniewski replied,
in English, 'Don't worry. Foreign investment is essential if the economy is
to be revitalised,' adding that the SLD in government would press the EC for
a timetable for Polish entry.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Ski resort bristles with Serb menace: Laura Silber visits a
Bosnian stronghold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE people of Pale in Bosnia can tell you how Serbs and Moslems lived
alongside each other in peace before war began in April last year. They
remember those times, but now they speak the language of war - of military
victory and of their contempt for their Moslem adversaries.
Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold just 10 miles above the besieged Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo, was once a prosperous ski resort, hosting the 1984
Winter Olympics. Now it is overrun with soldiers and refugees, and is the
makeshift headquarters of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state.
Every home is surrounded by stacks of wood in preparation for the harsh
Bosnian winter, as townspeople tend their gardens. Flocks of sheep wander
through the village streets crowded with men in khaki uniforms.
Serb artillery guns are positioned just outside the town nestled in
picturesque mountain peaks dotted with wooden chalets and fields filled with
livestock.
'The only solution is to defeat the Moslems militarily,' said 40-year-old
Mrs Biljana Rajic, a hairdresser, showing no trace of regret as she speaks
of her former countrymen.
Many of the townspeople show impatience and contempt for their Moslem
adversaries.
They blame the Moslems for the 18 months of destruction and war. They name
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, as the main obstacle to peace.
A Bosnian Serb soldier, Marko Subotic, remained defiant: 'We are not going
to make new territorial concessions that Izetbegovic is seeking. He is only
trying to stop the peace process by demanding access to the Adriatic or more
land.'
Some accuse Mr Izetbegovic of orchestrating revenge against their new Serb
state. Mr Ljubomir Klacar, a 59-year-old labourer, said: 'They want access
to the sea only to smuggle in weapons.'
Serb nationalists in Pale yesterday warned that the Moslems faced total
military defeat if they rejected the proposed tri-partite division of Bosnia
into ethnic mini-states. Mr Izetbegovic, they said, would have to endorse
the plan put forward by international mediators or lose everything.
Mr Bozidar Kostovic, a former trade clerk turned fighter, said: 'Serbs have
already ceded 20 per cent (of Bosnia). The Moslems hold 10 per cent but are
refusing to agree to the plan which gives them 30 per cent.'
'A solution will be reached only when the Moslems lose what they hold now.
Then they will talk.'
Even after the cancellation of yesterday's meeting in Sarajevo to sign an
agreement on Bosnia's division, Mr Slavisa Rakovic, senior adviser to the
Bosnian Serb state, remained optimistic the plan would soon be endorsed.
Although he admitted the partition might unleash a further exodus of
refugees, Mr Rakovic said: 'If there is a successful settlement here, I
don't see any possibility of the war spreading.'
Although he called Mr Izetbegovic the main 'loser', he dismissed Bosnian
objections that, under the peace plan, their landlocked republic would be
doomed, wedged between hostile Serb and Croat states.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Russian betrayal leaves Georgia's
president adrift - A look at the plight of Eduard Shevardnadze, risking
death or capture by secessionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGIA presents the most miserable spectacle of any of the countries which
achieved 'independence' since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Economically
prostrate, in the process of being dismembered, its head of state now in
danger of death or capture by secessionists, it is close to collapse as a
functioning state.
The present conflict centres on the formerly pleasant resort of Sukhumi,
capital of the Abkhazian autonomous republic - where Abkhazian forces,
seeking independence for their state, yesterday claimed to have advanced to
within 300m of the Georgian government headquarters in the town, having
taken the TV tower and a hill overlooking the city administration building.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of state, is in the city, possibly in that
building: with him is Mr Gia Karkarishvili, the defence minister. Both have
called on Sukhumi to be defended 'to the last drop of blood'. Mr
Shevardnadze, the co-architect with Mr Mikhail Gorbachev of the grand turn
in Soviet foreign policy which brought an end to the cold war, may end his
days in the hopeless defence of a provincial capital in a small country
whose fate he has made his own.
Histrionic and impulsive, the Georgian leader also seems to have been
betrayed by the Russians. He agreed with foreboding to a Russian-guaranteed
ceasefire with Abkhazia. When the Abkhazians broke it with a ferocious
attack on Sukhumi last weekend, the Russian Foreign Ministry threatened
sanctions against Abkhazia.
This was not the position taken by the Defence Ministry, which had the power
to enforce the ceasefire by the use of troops. General Pavel Grachev, the
defence minister, told the Georgians, not the Abkhazians, to withdraw their
troops from Abkhazian territory as the only way to get peace. In this, he
takes the same position as the Abkhazian negotiators at talks going on in
the Russian resort of Sochi.
It now appears clear that Russian policy, at least that followed by the
Defence Ministry, is solidly pro-Abkhazian. 'It is already too late to help
them,' the visiting UK defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, was told on
Monday.
Georgia's humiliation at the hands of Abkhazian formations, armed with
modern, sophisticated weapons, is an object lesson in the crudity of Russian
pressure. Russia's assistance to the Abkhazians has been matched by its
absence of support to Georgia: as in Azerbaijan, where losses to the
Armenians forced a change of government and a decision - taken two days ago
 -by the parliament to apply for membership of the Russian-dominated
Commonwealth of Independent States, so in Georgia the question of mending
the fences with Russia has arisen.
Mr Vakhtang Goguadze, chairman of Georgia's parliament, told fellow deputies
on Monday night that he favoured joining the CIS. Part of the reason, he
said, was that Russian generals had told him they could not help Georgia
because they had no security treaty with it.
The Abkhazian forces seem likely to prevail in Sukhumi, and thus to
consolidate control in territory from which the Georgians have largely been
expelled - in spite of the fact that they outnumbered the Abkhazians by
nearly three to one.
Abkhazia has made it clear it wants its autonomous status safeguarded by
Russia, not by Georgia.
It is not alone. South Ossetia, another autonomous region, was also at war
with Georgian forces two years ago. Peace was secured last year by Russian
troops.
Adjaria, the third autonomous area, where comparative peace has been
observed, is also distrustful of Tbilisi, but lacks a common border with
Russia.
The lesson few Georgian politicians have learnt is that all non-Georgian
peoples in the republic appear to prefer Russian to Georgian rule.
Further, the man violently displaced to make room for Mr Shevardnadze -
former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia - has not given up his ambitions to
return.
His troops have taken most of the towns in Mingrelia - the region in the
centre of Georgia from where Mr Gamsakhurdia originates. They have said that
they have suspended hostilities, ostensibly to assist in the government's
efforts to hold Sukhumi. Their column, which set out from the town of
Ochamchira on Monday to fight its way into Sukhumi, has yet to appear in the
Abkhazian capital.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Crisis tests the loyalty of a disaffected
army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin has taken care to pay court to, and be photographed with,
elite divisions of troops stationed near to Moscow in the past two weeks.
He declared, on one of these visits, that he would 'work with the military',
one day out of every month. It is now obvious why this attention was
lavished on a group which had felt - and probably still feels - out in the
cold.
The Russian Army - the successor to the Soviet Army - has shrunk faster than
any military force not demobilised from war and has suffered a precipitous
decline in prestige, to the point where thousands of (especially young)
officers are resigning their commissions.
It is so limited in its supplies that training flights are disallowed,
firing practice is curtailed and there have even been cases of starvation
reported in the Pacific Fleet. An army under such pressure may be a
dangerous army and may also be a disloyal one.
Its first response was standard. The head of the Defence Ministry
information service, General Vladimir Kosyrev, said last night that the
'armed forces of the Russian Federation in all its actions would be guided
only by the constitution and the laws of the country and would above all
observe strict political neutrality.'
The difficulty is, however, in knowing what political neutrality means when
two rival 'presidents' - one of them, General Alexander Rutskoi, was a
distinguished serving officer - both claim the constitutional right to tell
them what to do.
At the top level, Mr Yeltsin has taken care to have his own men. General
Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, is a hero of the coup attempt in August
1991 (when he refused to deploy the paratroopers he then commanded against
Mr Yeltsin's stand in the White House) and, though often said to be isolated
at the top of an officer corps who regards him as an upstart, is probably
loyal.
Yet, according to a senior parliamentarian last night, Gen Grachev had
yesterday argued violently on the phone with Mr Yeltsin, who was clearly
soliciting his support - at one point saying: 'What do you want me to do?
Bring the troops in (to Moscow) or what?'
At the Security Ministry (the former KGB), a new appointment has just filled
the gap left by the departure of Mr Victor Barannikov, the security
minister, whose loyalty was in doubt.
Mr Nikolai Golushko, his deputy, now minister, is a long-serving KGB man
(once the head of the department which spied on internal dissidents), and is
likely to have been checked out for allegiance to the president.
Mr Victor Yerin, the gruff interior minister (who has like Mr Golushko, many
thousands of troops at his command) is likely to be loyal, if for no other
reason than that the parliament wishes to sack him.
These are the president's military men; however, the men below them may be
more restive. The Officer's Union, the openly hostile group of serving
officers within the military which have long called for a resumption of
Soviet rule, are vocal and may also be numerous. Each officer will have a
tug on his loyalty oath: it is to the president, but to which president?

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Yeltsin's attempt to break the deadlock in Russia by suspending
parliament threatens to split public opinion down the middle, to judge by
the results of a recent nationwide survey.
A public policy survey of Russians conducted in mid-summer showed that 52
per cent favoured presidential rule by decree - but 48 per cent were
opposed. Furthermore, 48 per cent of Russians said they believed parliament
should have the right to veto presidential decisions.
The survey, based on interviews with 1,975 respondents in urban and rural
areas from late June to late July, was conducted by the Russian Centre for
Public Opinion Research. It showed Russians effectively split into four
groups, none of them in the majority: 32 per cent supported rule by
presidential decree without a veto by parliament; 28 per cent advocated
legislative rule by parliament without presidential decrees; 20 per cent in
effect favoured gridlock - a combination of presidential decrees and a
parliamentary veto - and 20 per cent opposed both presidential decrees and
parliamentary rule.
Mr Yeltsin's call for an early parliamentary election is endorsed by 65 per
cent of Russians. In addition, 44 per cent believe there should be an early
presidential election. Here again, opinion splits four ways, for one-third
of Russians would like elections soon for both president and parliament, and
28 per cent are against any election.
A total of 84 per cent of Russians said they thought the Constitutional
Court should resolve disputes between the president and parliament.
Two-fifths would prefer Mr Yeltsin to be replaced by an old-style communist
regime.

study on east European public opinion.

<TEXT>
THE FACT that the Russian army, although demoralised, underfunded and in the
throes of a sharp reduction, is still a force to be reckoned with was amply
demonstrated yesterday to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the visiting UK defence
secretary.
Mr Rifkind, who has held extensive talks here with his Russian opposite
number, General Pavel Grachev, was treated to displays of paratroop
assaults, helicopter and ground fire power and hand-to-hand fighting near
the Tula military base south of Moscow.
The 106 Guards Airborne Division garrisoned at Tula played a crucial role in
the August 1991 coup attempt in Moscow by failing to move in support of the
coup leaders.
There was no sign of abnormal activity around the base early yesterday
afternoon, although journalists were given no access to senior Russian
officers attending.
The elite division, commanded by Major General Alexander Lebyed, one of the
most respected officers in the Russian army, is considered a showcase and
betrays little of the troubles affecting other parts of the armed forces.
A senior officer complained recently that a large proportion of soldiers had
not been paid for two months.
Many units are seriously under strength, with only 13 to 15 per cent of
conscripts responding to their call-up papers. Troop reduction is taking
place faster than planned.
Experts consider the army, which has changed its uniforms and insignia from
the old Soviet model, is lacking a hard core of competent senior
non-commissioned officers, but say it retains the structure of an organised
force.
President Yeltsin has come under fresh criticism from the military
establishment for remarks indicating he would not object to countries such
as Poland and the Czech Republic, former members of the Warsaw Pact, joining
Nato.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Die is cast in Moscow for a fight to the
finish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIE, long awaited, appears to be cast. In his television address to the
nation, broadcast at 8pm Moscow time on the channel still received in most
parts of the former Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin finally and
explicitly acknowledged that he could not create new constitutional forms of
government without breaching the present, Soviet era constitution. He has
decided to do so: and has signed the order dissolving the parliament.
It has been an excruciating delay since, in April, he received the support
of the Russian people in a referendum for himself and for his economic
policies. That vote, surprisingly positive from a people wearied of
political squabbles and economic decline, was followed by further squabbling
(at a higher pitch) and further decline (at a faster rate).
Mr Yeltsin had identified two projects which he was determined to set in
train. One was the creation of a federation council which would form the top
tier of a new, two-chamber parliament, to be known as the federal assembly.
It is this last body which, last night, he said would be the supreme
legislative body in the country - even though, last weekend, at their
meeting in Moscow, the regional leaders refused to agree to their
transformation into the new assembly's upper tier.
The second was the publication of a new constitution, to lay the legislative
basis for the vexed question of the division of power among the presidency,
parliament, government and regional and local administrations. He wanted at
the very least an electoral law and a 'short constitution' allowing
elections to the new body which would supersede the standing Supreme Soviet
and its Congress of People's Deputies.
Parliamentary leaders, with their own draft of a constitution, had appealed
to the president to meet them to discuss merging the two drafts. This
appeal, apparently, had fallen on deaf ears, probably because the president
and his advisers did not believe that a draft outlining a strong presidency
and a subordinate parliament could be merged with one calling for a strong
parliament and a presidency confined largely to foreign affairs, nominations
of leading government figures and ceremony.
Mr Yeltsin devoted at least half of last night's address to attempting to
show that all his efforts at compromise over the past months had been in
vain, saying that in the last few days it had become obvious no co-operation
between presidency and parliament was possible.
'Parliament', he claimed, 'has been seized by a group of persons who have
turned it into the staff of the irreconcilable opposition. Hiding behind
deputies, this group is pushing Russia towards the abyss. . . (it) has lost
its right to be in control of crucial levers of state power.'
As well as a stasis of political power, the president has seen a collapse of
any hopes of economic regeneration this year. Inflation, lowered in the
spring to around 15 per cent a month, reached around 30 per cent in August.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, said in an interview published
yesterday that it would not fall below a 15-20 per cent range this year.
Decisions by the parliament to increase spending on a range of social and
industrial programmes would have pushed the deficit up to around 25 per cent
of GNP - and Mr Yeltsin's refusal to sign the budget into law was held by Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, to be a breach of the
constitution.
In naming Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former acting prime minister, to be first
deputy premier in charge of the economy, the president again defied a
parliament which had brought about Mr Gaidar's dismissal from office last
December. In his appointment, Mr Yeltsin was also trying to address the
fears of the Group of Seven nations and the International Monetary Fund that
the reformers were hopelessly off track and could not attract more
assistance while they remained so.
Now that he has, in a stroke, rid himself of his opponents, he will
presumably give free rein to Mr Gaidar and to the reformers to bring in the
measures about which they have spoken for so long - tight credit, cuts in
budget programmes and faster progress in privatisation.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Economy at heart of conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS no accident that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister
who approved earlier this month a package of emergency measures to cut
budget expenditure, stipulated the bulk of remaining funds should go to the
army.
But although Mr Yeltsin now bids for the army's support, his conflict with
parliament had in recent weeks crystallised over the more mundane issue of
the country's budget deficit.
Last night he cited parliament's 'so-called economic policy' - led by its
demands for increased budget expenditure without a corresponding increase in
revenues - as a glaring example of 'political games played at the expense of
the people'.
His suspension of parliament cancels at least one appointment he had been
anxious to avoid; parliament was due on Friday to consider the government's
request to borrow just Rbs4,700bn from the Russian central bank to finance
the deficit.
Deputies were intending to force the government to borrow Rbs15,000bn, to
make parliament appear the kinder side in the conflict.
The government has sought to keep such loans down to avoid the financial
system's collapse. The money would simply have been printed by the central
bank, thereby fuelling inflation. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance
minister responsible for the budget, said in an interview last week: 'I am
afraid that if it does this, parliament will say the government has this
money and must therefore spend it.'
The government's strategy has been to keep down the deficit and raise
revenues with a package of emergency measures, including stiff tax increases
and sales of up to 100 tonnes of government gold stocks to Russian
commercial banks.
The government's main challenge now, should parliament stay dissolved, is to
pursue unpopular policies.
If, in addition to the various measures being undertaken by the Finance
Ministry, central bank loans were kept to Rbs5,000bn, the deficit could fall
to 8 per cent of GDP by the end of the year.
This would put it within the 10 per cent limit agreed by the government with
the International Monetary Fund as a condition for at least Dollars 1.5bn in
additional financial assistance by the end of the year.
Sales of these dollars within Russia would help keep inflation down by
absorbing surplus roubles held in the economy, and relieve pressure on the
government to apply the tough tax increases it probably does want to impose
in the months leading up to parliamentary elections.
Another big challenge facing the central government - especially if some
regions rebel against Mr Yeltsin's announcement - is to get all the regions
and republics to pay their taxes.
Speaking before Mr Yeltsin's announcement, Mr Alexashenko said the
government had options to bring rebel republics and regions into line over
taxation by, for instance, withholding deliveries of cash, or confiscating
valuable exports bound for the west.
But again, Mr Yeltsin will be relying on republican and regional leaders to
stay on his side.
Although it has been held up as a key justification for Mr Yeltsin's
dramatic action, economic policy is likely once again to take a back seat
until the political dust settles.

Mr Boris Yeltsin's decision to tackle his parliamentary opponents head-on
was widely seen yesterday as the moment when he finally staked his political
survival on the success of his economic reforms, Edward Balls reports.
An observer close to the reform effort, who would not be named, said
international financial institutions were not surprised Mr Yeltsin had acted
because it had become clear the two sides' failure to compromise on
constitutional differences could not be sustained.
If these could be settled, Russia could press on with economic reform.

FT  22 SEP 93 / US, German air talks near climax

NEGOTIATIONS between the US and Germany on a new aviation agreement between
the two countries are expected to reach a climax this week and threaten to
have significant repercussions for airlines on both sides of the Atlantic.
If agreement is reached during the latest round of talks starting in Bonn
today it would clear the way for a far-reaching collaboration deal between
Lufthansa, the German airline, and United Airlines, one of the three biggest
US carriers.
However, both sides are still deadlocked on a series of controversial
issues.
Germany has already threatened to abrogate the existing bilateral aviation
agreement which expires at the end of next month. It would follow the
example of France which has already abrogated its aviation agreement with
the US.
Germany, like France, has complained that US airlines have had an unfair
advantage over their national carriers because old bilateral accords have
given US carriers virtually unbridled access into their markets without
similar access for their airlines in the US.
Lufthansa has suffered a drastic loss of market share on north Atlantic
routes since 1989 when US carriers started intensifying their drive into the
German market. The German airline has seen its market share drop from 40 per
cent to barely 25 per cent during this period.
Lufthansa urgently needs to improve its yield on transatlantic routes which
account for about 20 per cent of its overall business and contributed
significantly to an operating loss of DM482m (Pounds 195m) in the first five
months of this year.
The German government is seeking two important concessions from the US
including a three-year freeze on capacity on North Atlantic routes and
agreement to allow Lufthansa to enter a code-sharing partnership with United
Airlines.
Code-sharing, a marketing arrangement between two airlines, allows them to
use each other's identification codes in computer reservation systems. This
would allow Lufthansa to book passengers to far more US destinations and in
turn offer the same advantage to United in Germany.
It would also place Lufthansa on a more competitive footing against British
Airways, which has an equity partnership and code-sharing deal with USAir,
and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which has a similar arrangement with Northwest
Airlines. Air France has also recently negotiated a commercial agreement
with Continental Airlines.
But the US in return is asking Germany to allow Northwest the right to
extend its Amsterdam services to the German market through its code-sharing
arrangements with KLM.
This has been opposed so far not only by Lufthansa but also by another US
carrier, Delta, which has invested heavily in developing a hub at Frankfurt
by acquiring the German business of the now defunct Pan American Airways.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Ekostahl subsidy could hit EC steel plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER, REUTER and ARIANE GENILLARD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's controversial restructuring plan for the steel
industry could fail if Germany insists on subsidising new capacity at
Ekostahl in eastern Germany, warned Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry
commissioner, in Brussels yesterday.
Mr Bangemann was speaking after a meeting of EC industry ministers in which
the future of the east German plant emerged as the key remaining obstacle to
a resolution of the subsidies issue - which would clear the way for
restructuring to go ahead. Mr Bangemann said the Commission hoped to be able
to propose a 'reasonable' solution in the next two to three weeks for Ilva,
the state-owned Italian producer.
Talks between the Italian government and the Commission had stalled in the
summer over capacity cuts at the heavily-indebted steelmaker, but are now
making progress. Further high-level talks were held yesterday between the
Commission and the Italian delegation to yesterday's meeting.
'We have already found a solution to the Spanish case,' said Mr Bangemann,
referring to the restructuring plan for the main Basque plants agreed by the
Commission, Madrid and the Basque government in recent weeks. 'It depends on
the attitude of the German government as to whether we can complete the
package.'
Industry ministers need to approve settlements of all the three main subsidy
issues - Ilva, Ekostahl and CSI in Spain - before the private sector
steelmakers come forward with their own offers of capacity cuts.
The original deadline for achieving this was September 30, but the
Commission still hopes that all the subsidy issues can be resolved by
November 18, when industry ministers meet again. The list of some 30m tonnes
of capacity cuts could then be completed by the end of the year and
implemented in 1994.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said the Commission could not
object to new capacity being built at Ekostahl or elsewhere if it was
privately financed. But if a majority of the funding came from the state,
the Commission would be unable to recommend that industry ministers approve
it.
Otherwise, yesterday's meeting made some headway, with all ministers
expressing the need for urgency and for real cuts in capacity.
Two smaller state subsidy issues, involving Freital in Germany and Sidenor
in Spain, were resolved in principle, but delegations from the UK, the
Netherlands, Denmark and France insisted they should not be approved finally
until all subsidy issues were settled.
The European Commission said it had opened an inquiry into a planned venture
between Germany's Mannesmann, Valtubes, a unit of France's Vallourec, and
Dalmine, a subsidiary of Italy's state steelmaker Ilva, to see whether
competition in the market would be badly damaged by the alliance, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
German steelmakers yesterday said they would appeal in the US Court of
International Trade against the US government's decision to impose stiff
dumping duties on steel products from 19 countries, writes Ariane Genillard
in Bonn.

The following are excerpts from Mr Boris Yeltsin's live television address
to the Russian people last night:
'Parliament has been seized by a group of persons who have turned it into

'My duty as president is to state that the current corps of deputies has
lost its right to be in control of crucial levers of state power. The
security of Russia and its peoples is more precious than a formal obedience
to contradictory norms created by the legislature.
'These will not be fresh elections to the Congress or Supreme Soviet

Deputies' credentials are invalid.
'I appeal to the leaders and peoples of foreign states, to our friends
abroad - there are lots of them around the world. Your support is important
for Russia. The measures to which I had to resort were the only way to
defend democracy and freedom in Russia.
'Any actions aimed at preventing elections will be considered illegal and
persons involved in these actions will be brought to account under criminal
law.
'The already weak legal foundation of the already weak Russian state is
being deliberately eroded. Laws are being approved for the sake of momentary
political goals. Most of the sessions of the Supreme Soviet have been going
on with violations of the established procedures. That discredits the very
foundation of parliamentarianism.
'The only way to overcome the paralysis of state power is to fundamentally
renovate it on the basis of the rule of the people and constitutionality.
'The current constitution doesn't allow that - neither does it allow for the
passage of a new constitution. Being the guarantor of security of the state,
I must offer a way out of the stalemate, and to break this disastrous,
vicious circle.'

FT  22 SEP 93 / Yeltsin plunges Russia into crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA was plunged into an acute political crisis last night as its
president and vice-president both claimed supreme state authority and the
allegiance of the people and the armed forces.
President Boris Yeltsin precipitated the long-awaited confrontation with
parliament and General Alexander Rutskoi, his vice-president and main
opponent, when he dissolved parliament, called elections for December and
took emergency executive powers.
But his unilateral action was immediately challenged by parliament, the
constitutional court and Gen Rutskoi, who proclaimed Mr Yeltsin's act
unconstitutional and declared himself president.
Early this morning the army appeared to be staying neutral and there was no
evidence of imminent armed conflict. But it was unclear who was in control
and the scene seemed set for a prolonged power struggle.
In a nationwide television address Mr Yeltsin told the Russian people he had
dissolved the existing legislature - the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of
People's Deputies - and had called for elections to a new bicameral
parliament, or Federal Assembly, for December 11 and 12, to be followed by
early presidential elections.
The country's constitutional court ruled that Mr Yeltsin had violated the
constitution and could be impeached. Its chairman, Mr Valery Zorkin, told
parliament after an emergency session the court had concluded that Mr
Yeltsin's decree and statement did not correspond with the constitution and
were a 'basis for impeaching the president'. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary speaker, appealed to all military, interior and security
troops and militia to disobey the 'criminal orders' of the president and
parliament voted to order the central bank to stop financing government and
presidential structures.
Shortly afterwards parliament reported that Mr Sergei Glazyev, the country's
trade minister had resigned in protest at Mr Yeltsin's action.
Mr Khasbulatov called on all regional and republican parliaments throughout
Russia to hold immediate sessions to denounce the president's decree and
told workers to mount strikes in defence of the constitution'. However, the
prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, in an effort to calm an inflamed
situation, indicated he remained loyal to Mr Yeltsin. 'I will carry out what
is necessary for the government and the orders of the president,' he said
after a government meeting. When asked if he meant Mr Yeltsin, Mr
Chernomyrdin replied 'yes'.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister - who returned to his
duties yesterday after being cleared of corruption charges - said that the
heads of the 'power' ministries of Defence, Security and the Interior, who
command all of the country's armed forces, had expressed support for Mr
Yeltsin.
There were signs, however, that Mr Yeltsin had not gained the full consent
of all of his supporters before last night's dramatic announcement. A senior
parliamentarian, speaking on condition of anonymity, said many members of
the presidential team had advised against the move.
He said senior members of the collegium of the Ministry of Defence had come
to parliament after a meeting yesterday - and had retailed an account of a
conversation between Mr Yeltsin and General Pavel Grachev, the defence
minister, in which, in response to obvious pressure from the president for
his support, Gen Grachev had asked: 'What do you want me to do - bring in
the army, or what?'
Last night a statement from Russia's armed forces said they would obey the
constitution and 'as in the past maintain strict neutrality'. Communists
manned the barricades outside parliament in protest at Mr Yeltsin's decree,
but there was little sign of stepped-up military activity.
The parliament responded swiftly to Mr Yeltsin's announcement by voting late
last night to strip him of his powers. A hastily-convened emergency session
swore in Gen Rutskoi, still suspended by Mr Yeltsin from his
vice-presidential duties on corruption allegations, as president.
Gen Rutskoi quickly announced his first decree: 'To declare null and void
all decrees issued by President Boris Yeltsin on September 21. Leaders of
regions and (semi-autonomous) republics within the Russian federation are
obliged to act within the constitution.'
Earlier Gen Rutskoi said Mr Yeltsin had dismissed himself from power by
breaching the constitution, and that he, Gen Rutskoi, was now president.
'This is a direct violation of the constitution,' he said from within the
White House, or Russian parliament. 'It is an open state coup.'
Mr Yeltsin said in his address he had taken all necessary measures to ensure
security - and lorryloads of troops were deployed outside buildings such as
the Interior Ministry.
Anarchy, Mr Yeltsin said, could not be allowed in a country possessing
nuclear weapons. His action was necessary to preserve both democracy and the
still weak Russian market.

FT  22 SEP 93 / Coal to be split for sell-off against management wish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is to be offered for sale as five regional businesses, contrary
to the wishes of its management, which wanted to keep it together.
Announcing preliminary details of the privatisation yesterday, Mr Tim Eggar,
energy minister, said that this structure was most likely to attract buyers.
But he emphasised that a purchaser could bid for any number of parcels, so
British Coal could still be sold in one piece.
A privatisation bill will be put to the next parliamentary session so that
the sale can be made by early summer 1994.
The regions into which British Coal will be split for the sale will be
Scotland, Wales, the north-east and the central coalfield, to be divided in
two based on Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.
The businesses will be offered to trade buyers, but government finance is
also available to help management and employees put together buy-out teams.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, said: 'It will be interesting to
see, following their assessment of the business and the various risks
involved, whether prospective purchasers will be seeking combinations of
sale packages when they submit offers to the government.'
Mr Eggar said he had received expressions of interest reaching 'double
figures'. 'This structure is just what we wanted,' said Mr Richard Budge,
chief executive of RJB Mining. The UDM, the breakaway miners' union, said it
also was working on a bid, with East Midlands Electricity and an unnamed
foreign partner.
A threat to the sale emerged yesterday, however, when Nacods, the mining
supervisors' union, was allowed by the courts to challenge a radical
overhaul - essential to privatisation - of health and safety regulations.
The High Court ruled that the reforms might conflict with the health and
safety law principle that changes must not lead to a deterioration in safety
rules.
The reforms, which are due to take effect on October 1, abolish the function
of deputy, the supervisory workers represented by Nacods, replace some
statutes with codes of practice and give mine managers more discretion over
applying safety rules.

FT  22 SEP 93 / West backs Russian leader but markets waver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, GEORGE GRAHAM, LAURIE MORSE and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON, CHICAGO, KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN leaders yesterday gave broad backing to President Boris Yeltsin in
his battle for power with the Russian parliament, but Wall Street underlined
their nervousness by ending the day sharply down.
President Bill Clinton said he 'believed that the path to elections for a
new legislature was ultimately 'consistent with the democratic and reform
course', and Mr Warren Christopher, his secretary of state, said support for
Russian reform at this time was 'an investment in the national security of
the United States'.
Mr Clinton had delayed any substantial comment on the events in Moscow until
he had spoken with the Russian leader by telephone 'to seek assurances that
the difficult choices that he faces will be made in a way that ensures
peace, stability and an open political process'.
The White House seemed to be caught by surprise at the turn of events in
Moscow, but Mr Clinton acknowledged that Mr Yeltsin faced 'a constitutional
crisis that had reached a critical impasse and had paralysed the political
process'.
Arriving in Washington, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, was
much more forthright in his backing for Mr Yeltsin's dissolution of a
'hangover from the past'.
'I believe that President Yeltsin is justified in what he has done. His
democratic credentials are far stronger than those of the body that has been
dissolved,' Mr Hurd said, accusing the Russian parliament of wanting 'to one
degree or another, to go back to a communist state'.
In Bonn, however, the government made no formal pledge of support. It said
Germany was watching developments with great concern, and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl was being kept constantly informed. A proper evaluation of the events
was not possible, because of the lack of clarity about the outcome.
It was unclear whether Mr Yeltsin had informed western powers of his
intentions in advance. Reports from Bonn said western ambassadors in Moscow,
had been told, but delayed reaction appeared to belie this.
One senior US official said that Mr Christopher had received warnings more
than a week earlier, but the State Department insisted that it had only
learnt of the plans an hour beforehand.
Britain was the first country to throw its support decisively behind Mr
Yeltsin. Mr John Major, the prime minister, on a visit to Malaysia, issued a
statement stressing that Mr Yeltsin was the first democratically elected
president in Russia and urging support for his reforms.
This position was echoed more moderately in France, where Mr Alain Juppe,
the foreign minister, said Mr Yeltsin now had democratic legitimacy in
Russia.
In New York the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 38.56 to close at
3,537.24, while news of the turmoil pushed the dollar, gold and oil prices
higher. In early Tokyo trading today, the Nikkei shed more than 270 points.
The reaction on US grain markets was subdued, largely because Russia's
status as a US grain buyer has been diminished by its poor credit position.

A TWO-DAY visit to Malaysia by Mr John Major, the prime minister, was jarred
last night when Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, accused
Britain of standing by while Bosnian Moslems were 'wiped out'.
Mr Major was clearly surprised by Dr Mahathir's attack, which soured the
atmosphere at a ceremonial banquet in Kuala Lumpur, the first official
function of the visit.
The Malaysian prime minister appealed to Britain to influence the European
Community to put an end to 'ethnic cleansing' before Bosnia was 'forever
cemented in history as the blackest catastrophe of the modern world'.
Taking hurried notes of Dr Mahathir's comments, Mr Major inserted a long
passage defending Britain's Bosnian role into his planned speech on
Commonwealth friendship. He said he felt 'as strongly as anyone else about
the wickedness and intolerance we see daily in Bosnia,' and claimed that
British action had saved hundreds of thousands of Bosnian lives.
The impact of Dr Mahathir's speech was, however, blunted by his reputation
as a frequent critic of Britain's role as a former colonial power. Observers
also suggested that Dr Mahathir was keen to demonstrate his concerns about
Bosnia to Malaysia's Moslem majority and to Moslem leaders elsewhere.
He said Malaysia's 'hearts cry out to the tragedy of an entire race being
wiped out in total disregard for even elementary decency', and warned that
'we cannot accept that it is right and just and democratic to sit by and
watch while such brutish acts are committed'.
Dr Mahathir said he understood Britain's concerns for the safety of its
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and the continuation of humanitarian aid. But
he said the European powers had repeatedly backed down from the threat of
air strikes after the threats had been 'arrogantly ignored' by Serb forces.
He called for 'resolute and credible action' against the Serbs, and told Mr
Major that European inaction risked igniting a widespread Balkan war.
'You are sending the wrong signals to certain countries east of Yugoslavia -
countries with a past history of violent acquisition of other people's
territories.'
Dr Mahathir was visited recently by Lady Thatcher, Mr Major's predecessor,
who has also called for stronger European action against the Bosnian Serbs.
Ironically, Lady Thatcher was at the centre of the last row with Malaysia in
the early 1980s, when Dr Mahathir launched a 'Buy British Last' campaign in
protest against British policies on trade.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (8): Innovation on all
fronts - Miniaturisation is allowing designers to pack more and more power
into notebook computers / Computing on the move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR most of the 1980s the business computer user who left the office faced
two unenviable choices - either to abandon access to computing power and the
data it generates, or to lug a heavy weight 'laptop' computer and all its
accessories.
That is no longer the case. The advent of the notebook computer in
particular has put real mobile computing power in the hands of users and in
turn led to the proliferation of mobile computing devices.
Today's portable computers range from high power colour note books boasting
state-of-the-art features to small hand held devices and the new generation
of Personal Digital Assistants epitomised by the Apple's Newton MessagePad,
pictured above.
Indeed, the portable segment of the personal computer market has been the
star performer over the past couple of years.
According to Dataquest, the market research organisation, worldwide notebook
computer shipment, led by manufacturers such as Toshiba, Apple, NEC and
Compaq more than doubled last year to 4.35m units.
Dataquest estimates that almost one in every five PCs sold last year was a
portable and the trend is accelerating. By 1997 Dataquest expects portables
and PDA's to account for more than 45 per cent of unit sales.
The notebook computer revolution has been made possible by greater silicon
integration and the overall trend towards miniaturisation which have allowed
designers to pack more and more computing power into lighter packages.
At the same time, low-power chips, new lightweight components like
PCMIA-card drives have enabled manufacturers to deliver most if not all the
functionality of desktop systems in much smaller boxes.
Notebook computers are used in addition to desktop machines, and increasing
as replacements. Mr Jeff Goldberg, European industry analyst with Dataquest
in London, says most corporate users want machines which offer similar
facilities to desktops and are able to run the same software. Increasingly
that means fast Intel 486 processors and colour screens.
For a growing number of business users, notebook computers form one part of
the 'mobile office.'
Equipped with a fax-modem and a mobile telephone they can be used to send
and retrieve data, electronic mail and facsimiles while on the move.
One Swindon based company, Vocom, has taken this process to its logical
conclusion building an integrated mobile office, comprising removable mobile
telephone, letter quality printer, fax and data modem and notebook computer,
into a briefcase. A single in-built power supply and battery charger meets
the power re quirements for all the equipment.
Other innovative machines to appear on the market recently have included
modular designed systems like the latest notebook computer range from
Elonex, the North London-based computer group.
The Elonex NB400 notebook allows the user to change almost every facet of
its operation. Aside from the ability to upgrade the CPU, expand removable
hard disk storage capacity and batter ies the user can simply and easily
switch screens.
Elonex claims this will enable customers to keep up with future display
technologies while the removable hard disk also allows a group of users to
'share' a machine but each retain their own hard disk data.
A handful of other manufacturers including Japan's NEC and Italy's Olivetti
with the recently launched Philos have adopted similar modular design
approaches.
OTHER innovations have included pen-based 'notepad' systems from a growing
number of notebook manufacturers and the Grid Convert ible, now supplied by
AST alongside its new ranges of high and budget-priced notebook systems. The
Convertible boasts both keyboard and penpad.
Pen-based systems, including smaller handheld devices like ACS Data's
robust TouchPC, are mainly being used for niche applications, for
example by insurance assessors, engineers completing customised forms on
site or warehousemen checking stock.
Apple has also achieved considerable success with its PowerBook systems
which were among the first notebooks with an integrated trackerball - a
feature which is increasingly common. Last year, Apple sold over 500,000
PowerBooks, worth more than Dollars 1bn.
More recently Apple's Duo System has begun to exploit the grow ing demand
for 'docking' systems. The Duo, like machines from other manufactures
including Compaq, combines a lightweight note book computer for use on the
road with a docking station which turns the machine into a sophisticated
desktop hooked up to the office network.
At 4.2 lbs, the Duo comes close to entering the sub-notebook category of
devices pioneered by Olivetti with the Quaderno, now in its second
generation, and Hewlett Packard with the recently launched Omnibook. But
despite high expectations the sub-notebook market has so far failed to live
up to expectations.
Dataquest's Mr Goldberg believes this is because they have been too
expensive and are generally viewed as 'add-ons' similar too, but more costly
than, electronic organisers. They also require the user to make more
compromises in terms of screen and keyboard sizes than full size notebooks.
However, he concedes that they could be successful 'if people get the price
and the market right.'
Mr Goldberg is equally doubtfull about the short-term market for PDAs,
arguing that the first machines from manufacturers like Apple, Casio, Sharp
and others including Amstrad in the UK are generally too expensive and so
far offer few clear advantages over cheaper handheld computers and
pen-operated electronic organisers.
Even when prices fall he doubts whether PDA's will initially sell in
sufficient volumes to generate significant revenues for their manufacturers.
But not everyone agrees. Despite its relatively hefty price tag (Pounds 649
in the UK), the innovative Apple Newton MessagePad, which was officially
launched in Britain this month, has already found some ardent supporters.
MR Richard Woodington, director of Rothwell group which claims to sell more
Apple computers into the corporate sector than any other UK-based supplier,
says: 'Newton is breaking ground for the PDA market much the same way as the
Macintosh did for personal computing.
'Much of the same approach is evident in Newton - easy and intuitive use,
integrated software design and built - in communications.'
He claims that large businesses are allready showing tremendous interest in
Newton mainly because of its ability to log on to office electronic mail
systems, send and receive faxes and talk to PCs - all in a package which
fits on the palm of the hand and can also recognise handwriting.
'We see Newton as a potential mobile extension for client/server technology,
whereby an authorised user could have transparent access to a corporate
database from wherever they are,' he says.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the initial reaction to Newton from some
quarters has been mixed because of disappointment that it cannot immediately
provide cordless communications. But he says that the introduction of new
digital mobile services, like Mercury's One-2-One in the UK and GSM services
throughout Europe will 'bring Newton into a new dimension, making it truly a
mobile communications system.'
What does seem certain is that the worlds of digital processing and
telecommunications are continuing to converge and that in the future
business computer users will be offered a wide range of mobile computer and
communications systems aimed at specific market niches. Mobile computing
has, after all, not even reached its teenage years.

bid for FNAC

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH stock market authorities have asked Altus Finance and Compagnie
Immobiliere Phenix to clarify their intentions towards FNAC, the music and
books retailer, following an official investigation into their bid for
control of the company.
The investigation, which began last month after complaints about the
circumstances of the Altus and Phenix bid, concluded that a fair value for
FNAC, a bastion of French retailing and the dominant force in the music and
books market, was between FFr2.4bn (Dollars 427.05m) and FFr2.7bn.
Under the terms of their bid Altus, a subsidiary of the Credit Lyonnais
banking group, and Phenix, part of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux utilities
concern, had an option to buy a controlling 54.78 per cent stake in FNAC for
FFr1.2bn, thereby valuing the company for only slightly less than the lowest
estimate.
Altus and Phenix negotiated the option to buy the controlling holding with
Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires (GMF), the French mutual insurance
group which needed to raise capital to counter its losses on other
activities.
Other prospective purchasers have indicated their interest in FNAC, notably
Pinault-Printemps, the heavily indebted French retail group, and Bertelsmann
of Germany.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Nordbanken's gain shows in agency's loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENT of the problems jettisoned by the Swedish commercial bank
Nordbanken was made clear yesterday when Securum, which took on most of its
bad debts, announced a SKr12.9bn (Dollars 1.64bn) loss in its first six
months of operation.
Securum was set up by the Swedish government in January to speed up the
reconstruction of Nordbanken, allowing it to be returned to the private
sector as early as the second half of next year. Some SKr67bn in bad debts
were taken on by Securum, a separate state-owned agency which received a
SKr24bn equity injection from the government.
Nordbanken's subsequent return to profit has prompted criticism that it has
gained an unfair advantage over rivals who have not received state
assistance. In the first half of 1993, Nordbanken bounced back to a SKr1.7bn
profit from a SKr5.2bn loss in the same period of 1992.
Securum's six-month deficit stemmed almost entirely from SKr12bn in credit
losses, mainly linked to the collapse of the Swedish property market. Around
40 per cent of the losses are linked to 15 large credit engagements.
The process of selling off assets has already begun, although the focus of
Securum's efforts has been to sort out its bad loan portfolio with a view to
enhancing future sales values. The agency has been deliberately constructed
to avoid the need for distressed sales, with the sell-off phase expected to
last up to 15 years.
'We are only two miles into a marathon,' said Mr Lars Thunell, the head of
Securum.
The reorganisation of the credit portfolio is nearly complete and future
losses are expected to be much smaller. Around SKr15bn of Securum's SKr24bn
capital has already been wiped out, and the balance is expected to disappear
during the disposal phase.
Securum has 15 daughter companies, with activities in Sweden, the US and a
range of European countries including the UK, Germany and the Benelux
states.
It has already taken over 450 properties in Sweden, but the final total is
expected to be between 1,500 and 2,000. In addition to property, Securum
owns 61 per cent of Nobel Industries.
Sweden's Bank Support Authority, the state body set up to tackle Sweden's
banking crisis, said yesterday it had written down the value of Securum by a
further SKr13.15bn to SKr1bn.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Finns to debate new nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN energy industry leaders and environmentalists will be watching the
Finnish parliament closely today as debate opens on whether to approve
construction of a nuclear power plant.
The project, one of a few of its kind in Europe, has become the focus for
wider arguments over the merits of nuclear power. Within Finland, it has
prompted sharp debate in recent years, with the outcome of a free vote by
MPs due on Friday still uncertain.
Commercial interests are watching developments closely. Bids to build the
proposed FM10bn-FM15bn (Dollars 1.75bn-Dollars 2.62bn) plant have already
been received from ABB Atom of Sweden, Atomenergoexport of Russia and NPI, a
consortium formed by Siemens of Germany and Framatome of France.
Finland already has four nuclear reactors, built in the 1970s, with a total
capacity of 2,300MW. They supply about a third of the country's electricity
needs. Two, at Loviisa, east of Helsinki, are Soviet-made pressurised water
reactors with Finnish control systems. The other two are Swedish-built
boiling water reactors at Olkiluoto, on the south-west coast.
In 1975, talks began on building a fifth reactor of about 1,000MW capacity
at one of the existing sites. By 1986 the authorities were close to giving
the go-ahead when the Chernobyl nuclear accident led to radioactive fallout
over Finland.
The project was frozen until two years ago. The cabinet finally gave its
assent, by an 11-6 vote, in February, but that only intensified a debate
which has split the two largest parties, the governing Centre party and the
opposition Social Democrats.
Mr Markku Nurmi, a member of the national Energy Policy Council, says
Finland should not buck the international trend away from nuclear power. He
rejects projections showing steeply rising demand for electricity as
outdated.
But Mr Juhani Santaholma, head of the nuclear power utility Pevo, says
electricity consumption has gone on rising in spite of a fall in overall
energy consumption resulting from recession and several mild winters. He
insists that demand will rise significantly and that a new nuclear plant is
the only realistic way of bridging the gap.
Finland's energy-thirsty and powerful forestry industry is behind Pevo, as
are the unions. But the anti-nuclear camp has some key supporters of its
own, including Mr Esko Aho, prime minister and leader of the Centre party.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Arafat bid to calm Jordanian fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, flew to
Amman yesterday to discuss implications of the Gaza-Jericho accord, James
Whittington reports from Amman. Mr Arafat's visit also served as an
opportunity to calm fears that Jordan was being excluded from issues
effecting Palestinians and the region as a whole.
Despite initial reservations about being left out from the Israeli-PLO
negotiations, King Hussein has fully endorsed the Palestinian peace deal.
There has, however, been a noticeable shift in policy over the past week
from the traditional joint Jordanian-Palestinian stance to one where the
kingdom's interests take priority.
Two issues expected to be discussed with Mr Arafat were Jordan's economic
relationship with the West Bank, and the future status of the kingdom's
Palestinians who make up over half the population.
The government says it may have to postpone this year's multi-party
elections until the status of Palestinians living in the kingdom is
clarified. The elections, scheduled for November 8, were to be the first
since 1956 in which political parties would campaign.
However, there are fears that the elections may become a referendum on the
peace process with Islamist and leftist parties winning votes from those
Palestinians who have nothing to gain from the settlement.
Western diplomats express severe reservations about any postponement. 'The
damage to democracy would be considerable,' said one. 'Palestinians in
Jordan will feel targeted which could prove destabilising,' said another.
Jordan's nationalist parties and tribal leaders are especially vocal in
their calls for postponing the elections. Head of the nationalist party Al
Ahd, Mr Hadi Abdul Majali, who is also the prime minister's brother, argues
that either Palestinians who will be allowed to return should relinquish
their voting rights or the elections should be postponed.

<TEXT>
ITALY'S Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) has been embarrassed by
revelations that it failed to declare some L400m (Dollars 260,000) to the
tax authorities on a property deal.
The discovery led to the imprisonment over the week-end of Mr Marco Fredda,
in charge of property at the PDS, and Mr Primo Greganti, a former official
of the party when it was the Italian Communist Party (PCI).
This is the first time the PDS is accused of being involved in illicit party
financing. PDS officials have insisted no illegal party financing is at
stake like that of the other main parties.
However, the admission the party had knowingly kept funds which should have
been declared to the tax authorities has shown the PDS as anxious as the
rest to maximise its revenues.

VOTERS in Oslo may have to go to the polls again after a computer failure in
last week's general election, Reuter reports from Oslo.
But officials said that any rerun was unlikely to weaken the ruling Labour
Party's grip on power.
Oslo's electoral committee said a study of the September 13 election, when
the computer crashed after an overload, turned up irregularities which meant
it could not recommend that parliament accept the result of the vote in
Oslo.
'We don't think the result and the mistakes which have been discovered
affect the share-out of seats (in parliament), but there were so many
mistakes that it makes it difficult to approve,' Oslo's mayor, Ms Ann-Marit
Saeboenes, said.
A final decision on whether to rerun the election in Oslo, which elects 15
of 165 seats in parliament, will be taken by the new parliament on October
8.

THE THREE Bosnian factions were yesterday locked in secretive meetings on
board a British naval vessel, as international mediators made a last-minute
attempt to overcome obstacles to a Bosnian peace deal, due to be signed in
Sarajevo today.
Representatives from all three sides, including Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the Bosnian Croat leader,
Mr Mate Boban, held talks with Lord Owen and Mr Theovald Stoltenberg, the
international mediators, on board the aircraft carrier, HMS Invincible, in
the Adriatic sea.
Bosnian Serb officials in Pale, the capital of the self-styled Bosnian Serb
state, yesterday said that the Serb side was represented by Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader.
The meeting, said to have beencalled at the mediators' request, appeared to
mark a final attempt to overcome remaining territorial disputes, in
particular the Bosnian governments' demand for access to the Adriatic. The
three sides are expected to meet in Sarajevo today to sign a broad agreement
which would turn Bosnia into a loose union of three ethnic mini-states.
However, after all three sides indicated at the weekend they remained
opposed to any fresh territorial concessions, Lord Owen yesterday warned
that the meeting was still not definite. The mediators now appear to be
pushing the three sides to agree to an outline agreement, leaving some of
the territorial details to be decided at a later date.
But in spite of the sudden ceasefire agreements conducted between the
Bosnian government and their Serb and Croat counterparts last week, the
sticking points to a peace agreement remain the Bosnian government's demand
for further land and access to the sea.
Diplomats yesterday said the mediators' decision to call the meeting on the
ship appeared to be an attempt to escape the media spotlight and increase
pressure on the three sides.
'The thing about meeting on a ship is that you can't suddenly storm out,'
commented one British official yesterday.
Fighting was reported to be continuing between Moslem and Croat forces in
parts of central Bosnia in defiance of the ceasefire agreed last week.
A Bosnian Croat said Moslem forces had launched a three-pronged attack on
the city of Mostar. UN peacekeepers in central Bosnia said that earlier
fighting between Moslem and Croat forces around Vitez and Gornji Vakuf
appeared to be dying down.
Russia may be unwilling to send extra troops to help enforce a peace
agreement in Bosnia, General Pavel Grachev, its defence minister, has
indicated, writes David White in Moscow.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, said General Grachev made
clear in talks yesterday that he was not contemplating an increase.
The National Bank of Yugoslavia is to issue a 10bn dinar note to replace
currency made almost worthless by a devastating daily inflation rate of 20
per cent, Reuter reports from Belgrade.
The new white, black and red note will be issued today, the Belgrade-based
news agency Tanjug quoted central bank officials as saying. It is worth
Dollars 6 on Belgrade's foreign currency black market.
This will be the third new banknote issued in a month, each with more and
more zeroes to it. In mid-August the bank issued a 500m dinar note then
worth Dollars 3.50 and now worth 30 US cents.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Ex-communist who won over the Poles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Alexander Kwasniewski, the leader of Poland's neo-communist Left
Democratic Alliance (SLD), is the kind of man you probably would buy a used
car from.
But it clearly takes more than a smooth line in political patter to persuade
more than 3m Poles to cast their vote for a spruced up model which was
effectively scrapped in elections only four years ago.
At that time Mr Kwasniewski was an aide to Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Poland's
last communist prime minister. He played an important role in hammering out
the details of the 'round table agreement' with Solidarity which led to the
partially free elections in June 1989.
Designed to ensure continuing communist domination of the lower house of
parliament, the agreement blew up in the communists' face when Solidarity
made a clean sweep of all the seats in the senate and the limited number of
seats allocated to non-communist parties in the lower house.
But yesterday Mr Kwasniewski, 39 years old, was busy putting out feelers for
a grand coalition. If it comes off the SLD, by far the largest party of the
new parliament, would sit in alliance with at least one of the three
Solidarity-era parties which managed to pass over the 5 per cent entry
hurdle. That would seal an extraordinary reversal of political fates in only
four years. Even Mr Kwasniewski, whose reputation for strategic smartness
and political class soared during the election campaign, has been taken by
surprise.
Over a press dinner in one of Warsaw's smartest restaurants last week he
explained how the most optimistic of the young ex-communists who put
together the SLD from the ruins of the defunct communist party in 1990
thought it would be 10 or 15 years before it gained acceptance as a
mainstream, European, social democratic party.
But after a spell in a coalition, Mr Kwasniewski, like Willy Brandt of
Germany's social democrats, or more appropriately Spain's Felipe Gonzalez,
could take his SLD into power across the generation gap which Solidarity,
with its ageing, squabbling leaders, failed to achieve.

<TEXT>
THE US yesterday called a conference of potential donors to drum up aid in
support of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said he and Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, would convene a donors' conference to help
co-ordinate aid for Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
'Today, on behalf of President Clinton, I announce our intention to lead a
wide-ranging effort not simply to give peace a chance but to ensure that it
will not fail,' Mr Christopher said in a speech at New York's Columbia
University.
Administration officials said the purpose of the conference was not just
economic, but to demonstrate backing for last week's agreement and to
maintain momentum for the peace process.
Mr Christopher said the US would itself contribute Dollars 250m in cash,
loans and guarantees over the next two years.
Senior administration officials said the conference was likely to be held in
Washington in the next two weeks, taking advantage of the arrival in the US
of finance and foreign ministers attending the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as the United
Nations General Assembly.
They hoped the conference would produce several hundred million dollars of
commitments to cover the next 18 months, making a successful start towards
the World Bank's Dollars 300m a year estimate of investment needs over the
next 10 years.
Mr Christopher's speech yesterday, the first in a series of foreign policy
statements planned ahead of President Clinton's address to the UN on Monday,
declared the US's strong commitment to an active and assertive role in
international affairs.
'We must remain engaged not out of altruism, nor out of what one scholar has
called the 'imperial temptation', but because there are real American
interests that will suffer if we are seduced by the isolationist myth,' Mr
Christopher said.
The International Monetary Fund has approved a three-year, Dollars 569m loan
to help Egypt open up and reform its economy, Reuter reports from
Washington.
Although Egypt does not plan to draw down the loan, Cairo needed IMF
approval of its economic reform programme to win over Dollars 3bn in debt
forgiveness from the US and other creditor nations. Under a 1991 deal,
creditor nations agreed to write off 50 per cent of Egypt's Dollars 25bn
debt.

FT  21 SEP 93 / EC battles to save Gatt after food import objections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community was last night desperately trying to head off a
crisis over the Gatt world trade talks amid a warning from the UK that
failure to reach a deal would bring normal EC business to a halt.
Germany warned of 'catastrophic dangers' to its economy if Fran ce's
objections to the Blair House agreement between the EC and the US on
limiting subsidised farm trade wreck chances of concluding the Uruguay Round
by its December 15 deadline.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the EC would be paralysed by
recriminations if the Uruguay Round failed. 'It's not the case that in
causing a crisis in Gatt we can avoid an internal EC crisis,' he said. 'I
cannot conceive how the EC will continue with the normal transaction of
business if it were seen as causing the collapse of the Uruguay Round.'
As 35 EC foreign, agriculture and trade ministers met in Brussels, there
were nevertheless signs of an emerging consensus in favour of giving the
European Commission authority to test if the US is ready to accept an
amplification of Blair House to accommodate French concerns over limits on
its lucrative food exports.
Senior Commission officials, and others who negotiated Blair House last
November, said efforts to reach a compromise would centre on finding a
formula to delay cuts in subsidised food exports so as to run down EC food
mountains. 'If the Americans want to be helpful, that is an area in which we
can help resolve this,' one Commission negotiator said.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EC trade negotiator, has written to Washington
setting out concerns. But he warned ministers of the danger that the US
would in turn exact new concessions in other areas of the Gatt talks.
France's latest outline of its demands went further, covering adequate
protection for the EC against food imports, extension of the so-called
'peace clause' on EC-US farm trade disputes, and a provision indexing the
EC's share of international markets to their future growth, particularly in
Asia. 'What is at stake is the basic concept of Europe and solidarity
between us,' said Mr Alan Juppe, French foreign minister.
UK officials would not be drawn on whether Mr Hurd's comments amounted to a
UK threat to boycott EC initiatives. French officials seemed surprised by
the recent hardening of Britain's position, which other member states and
the Commission warned could make it more difficult to paper over
differences.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister and Bonn's foremost defender of
Gatt, said the French were 'playing for the highest stakes,' but added that
'we don't want to have a clash.'
Sir Leon pleaded to ministers not to tie his hands in the complex
negotiations running up to the Gatt mid-December deadline. He is due to meet
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, on September 27.
There was broad agreement last night that France would not force a vote on
Blair House, or seek to saddle the Commission with a formal mandate to
renegotiate Blair House.

FT  21 SEP 93 / BNP eyes European bank links: Privatisation candidate may
use Dresdner alliance to expand retail activities in the EC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris, the first candidate for privatisation by France's
centre-right government, may extend its alliance with Dresdner, the German
bank with which it has a cross-shareholding agreement, to include links with
other European banks.
Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman of BNP, said yesterday before the launch of the
bank's privatisation marketing campaign that BNP and Dresdner might consider
forging commercial links with other European banks to expand their retail
banking activities into other areas of the European Community.
'The agreement with Dresdner means that BNP's French clients can use the
Dresdner network in Germany and their German clients can use our branches in
France', Mr Pebereau said. 'Eventually we will need to offer a similar
facility in other countries. It is possible that together we might link up
with banks in Italy or the UK.'
Mr Pebereau emphasised that future alliances would be devised on a purely
commercial basis and, unlike the BNP/Dresdner deal, would not involve equity
participation. 'These agreements will be co-operative commercial ventures,'
he said. 'They will not involve an exchange of equity'.
The agreement between BNP and Dresdner, one of a number of cross-border
ventures recently concluded in European financial services, enables each
bank to take up to 10 per cent of the other's equity.
Shares will not be exchanged until after BNP's privatisation, which is
scheduled for completion by December 20. It also awaits authorisation by the
European Commission.
Mr Pebereau said BNP and Dresdner had not yet begun negotiations with any
prospective European partners. He added that the French and German banks
would wait until after BNP's privatisation and EC authorisation before
deciding how to orchestrate their future expansion in Europe.
He described the Dresdner alliance as central to BNP's strategy in retail
banking and in international banking for companies.
Mr Pebereau said BNP planned to concentrate on internal growth to develop
its international banking operations, but it might consider strategic
acquisitions in specific sectors.
He and the BNP board are beginning a series of marketing presentations this
week in preparation for the bank's sale to the private sector. BNP is under
considerable financial pressure because of the French recession.
BNP recently reported a 61 per cent fall in interim net profits from
FFr1.33bn in the first half of 1992 to FFr522m (Dollars 91.6m) in the same
period of this year, when it made net banking income of FFr21.23bn. Mr
Pebereau said that 1993 would be a difficult year and that 1994 would be
'difficult too' with 'the real recovery' coming in 1995.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (16): Service in high
demand - Training from a distance is the task of Ace-Hi in the Highlands and
Islands, but it needed the right technology to hold 'conversations' with
trainees / Remote working in rural areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FEW would deny that the quality of life in the Highlands and Islands is
high, but there is little highly-paid work. Ace-Hi is a government-funded
organisation set up on a Scandinavian telecottage model which trains people,
mostly women, to become teleworkers or teletrainers.
Ace-Hi's chief executive officer, Caroline Hay, believes there is a large
resource of highly skilled people in the highlands and islands, especially
among women. It might take as many as three flights and a ferry to reach the
Invergordon telecottage, so remote teletraining is vital and the service is
much in demand.
'Three years ago we did a pilot training scheme for women in Ross and
Cromarty who were housebound by caring commitments,' explains Hay. 'We had
100 applications for places.'
Ace-Hi sought technology that would enable its DOS-based PCs to connect via
a modem, and provide interactive 'conversation' with the trainee. There were
three criteria: a simple, friendly connection process for the end-user;
cost; and the degree of interactivity - 'there were only a handful of
possibilities three years ago. Microcom won on simplicity of use, but as an
unexpected bonus we also got easy file-transfer,' says technical officer
Colin Craig.
Hay is working on a vocational qualification for teletrainees, which she
says must preface any large-scale attempts to train and market telework
services. But already she notes a pattern of co-operation among the four now
fully productive workers trained in the 1991 pilot. They have several
contracts of their own, but other work is shared.
'Skills such as word processing and other business tasks are easily done
from home,' she says. 'It's a better-paid alternative to seasonal work in
the tourist industry or waitressing.'

A CAREER with computers no longer means working in an office for eight hours
a day. Many programmers already work remotely. And salespeople, too, are now
home-working and travelling with laptops and modems.
On this page, CLAIRE GOODING looks at some of the arguments in favour of
teleworking, and introduces some case-studies.
This topic was also examined in detail in the recent issue of the FT's
'Software At Work' survey, published on Wednesday September 8. The next
issue of 'Software at Work' on November 29 will look at: office automation;
geographical information systems; object orientated technology. For more

MARKETING pharmaceuticals to Russia and other former Soviet states is a job
that demands high-quality, specialised skills. And, as John Dyer, managing
director of the Hollister Group of companies points out, most of the
qualified people are of an age and experience to have established families,
and are not keen to relocate, however exciting the opportunity with a young
company such as Hollister.
'We use teleworking exclusively for our operations. We deal direct with
large institutions, ministries and government, and for that we need
experienced people who have worked for pharmaceutical companies, wherever
they are,' he explains.
Hollister has staff in Norfolk, north London and Hammersmith in west London,
all equipped with Macintosh computers, using Mac Connect software and ISDN
lines. Another is coming on-line soon in Heathrow.
'We have Macs because they are far and away the best business machines, they
are quick to learn, intuitive to use and inherently simpler.'
The Planet board gives access to ISDN; any alternatives, says Dyer, were
painfully slow. Going into ISDN is simple, with a point-and-click menu and a
list of pre-programmed numbers: the whole process can be made into one
shorthand keystroke.
Hollister used a local Cambridge consultant, System Support, to advise,
specify and implement the system. It still provides 24-hour support and
advice if needed when unfamiliar software is used. The equipment cost about
Pounds 6,000 per installation.
'The business benefits of teleworking are clear' says Dyer. 'I can employ
people who otherwise wouldn't work for me. We can all communicate easily,
and standardise on systems.' He uses his own Powerbook system at home and
when travelling.
On the whole, teleworking has proved very straightforward, although the one
disadvantage is that the employees miss social interaction in the office,
and so regular reviews and contact is necessary. 'However, most people love
it - and with ISDN we can operate all over the world,' says Dyer.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (17): Students log on
 -Education at home and in the office is available all over the world, on a
study programme run from Wolsey Hall, Oxford / Long-distance tutorials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MBA is much sought-after qualification, but its popularity comes at a
time when companies find it difficult to release staff for studies. Wolsey
Hall, Oxford, is a Distance Education centre and is helping Oxford Brookes
University to run a long-distance MBA programme for students all over the
world.
According to Peter Newell, chairman of Open Learning Centre, Wolsey Hall,
students come from every conceivable background, with ages ranging from
27-45, and one in 10 living outside the UK.
Although Newell hesitates to call this teleworking, long-distance computer
conferencing is an important part of the teaching structure, connecting the
tutor with a group of students who can log on for the cost of a local phone
call.
'With the tutor as moderator, a valuable interaction takes place, not
instantaneously, but perhaps over 24-36 hours,' he says.
The mechanism for connecting the students is supplied by CECOMM, which
provides each student with a 'conference connection' pack, which enables
them to connect a PC via a modem to the MBA host computer, using EUnet's
Internet services.
The host runs electronic mail and conferencing software, and via Internet
students can take part in the discussion groups or send private messages to
the tutors, course administrators, or other students.
Newell uses the system to connect 15 outworkers, (editors and proof readers
for the courseware) and 200 authors and tutors. 'The system is a good way of
communicating for people who learn to use it well,' says Newell.
'Electronic mail is not good for the autocratic manager because it's an
equaliser. It's not a substitute for conversation but it's a remarkably
powerful form of communication for quality, speed and efficiency: it enables
communications to fly around the business very fast indeed.'
EUnet GB pioneered the exchange of information between computers on public
access networks in 1979. Now it supports the communications networks of
hundreds of UK corporations.
CECOMM, an EUnet user, was set up in the 1980s to develop telematics in the
educational field and is currently developing the teleworking methodologies
used by such organisations as Wolsey Hall and the Oxford Business School.
'We train tutors and co-ordinate people using the systems who can be
corporate managers, part-timers - anyone using long-distance telecom
tutoring,' explains Charles Jennings, CECOMM consultant on Telematic
systems.
Providing a simple interface is part of the job, especially as users cannot
always have the standard Macintosh or DOS equipment.
'People just want a nice simple pipe that works,' says Jennings.
When sitting alone at the screen, getting lost in the system is a danger. To
help navigate, and answer the 'Where am I?' question, CECOMM has devised a
way of visualising the system with a 'map' using a floor layout which looks
like a faculty building, including administration (reception), conference
hall, cubicles for study, seminar rooms and even ja cafe.
In Jennings' experience, distance-learning by teleworking can suit all
sorts.
'Some of the people with the least technical experience, who work with
non-technical subjects, have produced some of the highest-quality work as
teletutors.'

applications are mainly limited - for the moment - to training and
point-of-sale information.
Multimedia combines animated, high-resolution graphics and video, hi-fi
sound, computer data, communications and - most important of all -
interaction between the system and the user.
Today's multimedia market is pre-eminently about training, although
presentations and kiosk applications - usually taken to mean point-of-sale
(p-o-s) displays or point-of-information screens in galleries, shopping
malls, airports or exhibitions - are fast-growing.
The research consultancy Ovum has estimated that the US and European market
for multimedia products and software would grow from just Dollars 500m in
1991 to over Dollars 9bn by 1997.
The expectation was that the training market, for example, would grow from
some Dollars 326m in 1991 to Dollars 422m by 1994 and Dollars 536m by 1997.
But even within that relatively conservative prediction, there are potential
pitfalls for vendors and those that invest in them. For while software
revenues are expected by Ovum to rise at an average of 13 per cent per year,
hardware revenues were only expected to rise by 5 per cent a year,
reflecting a decrease in hardware prices that is only likely to be partially
offset by ever-increasing volumes.
Training, distance-learning, open-learning (a slightly different concept)
and further education are inseparable within the multimedia canon. To
understand why, it is only necessary to quote one example - provided by the
National Council for Vocational Qualifications which, during its 'World
Class Britain' conference, last year, said that it wanted to see 1.2m
workers achieve NVQs by 1996.
At a time when all budgets for training and further education are under
pressure, that high target is unlikely to be met by conventional means. It
is, instead, being met by the use of new multimedia products such as CD-ROM,
CBT packages and multimedia's primogenitor, interactive videodisc.
Lloyds Bank, for example, has installed around 100 multimedia systems (based
on Wang computers, VideoLogic boards and CD-ROM) which supplement its
1,500-machine interactive video network and its use of computer-based
training (CBT). The use of the multimedia systems propels Lloyds distance
learning into the management arena.
'Distance-learning' is cost-independent of the number of students - and
there is considerable evidence that distance-learning reduces the overall
costs of training, says the senior manager of Lloyds training development
group, Howard Hills.
Further examples of this are evident elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, the
Deutsche Bundespost Postdienst has saved DM14.2m in time and travel costs
during the first four months of its multimedia training project.
Based around VideoLogic systems allowing the integration of video, audio and
still images on to 2,000 PC-based learning stations installed in German post
offices, more 100,000 employees have already undergone training.
Even more important, the market for generic materials, which had to some
extent been held down by the cost of interactive video replay systems, is
beginning to take off in the UK. It is already burgeoning in the US.
New companies, such as the Gloucestershire-based Xebec, which has just
signed to produce six packages a year for distribution in the US; CD-I
Training; Lasermedia; IIS, Maxim, Skillchange and Pitman (which acquired a
multimedia production house, Convergent, last year), are emerging to rival
the film and video training hegemony of companies such as Video Arts,
Longman Training and Melrose Films.
There are signs that the generic market for training is fast spilling over
into the education and what is termed the 'edutainment' sector, as well.
Educationalists have already toyed with a variety of systems while more than
Pounds 10m of government funding has been spent in the last five years on
attempts to bring interactive media into the classroom or the lecture
theatre.
Suddenly, things have started moving again, with products like 'The World of
Numbers' videodiscs and a CDTV-based project called 'Global Maths,'
targetted towards the National Curriculum. Education and the blend between
education and entertainment ('edutainment') also form the core of many
consumer-orientated CD-I and CDTV catalogues.
Point-of-sale multimedia has been slower to take off in the UK and Europe,
as was the use of more conventional media, such as video.
Mr James Roper, director of the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG)
believes that potential customers have been confused by the technology -
'there has also been a horrendous failure rate with pilot projects, because
people didn't realise the complexity of what they were getting into,' he
adds.
With more than 500 interactive retailing pilot projects started worldwide,
but a handful of success stories, Roper is, if anything, understating the
problem. But there are success stories. In the UK, Zanussi has increased
sales (up by 30 per cent over three years), and boosted brand awareness and
market share by using interactive p-o-s in nearly 600 white goods stores.
In Denmark, the estate agency, Home, has increased its market share from
15-23 per cent since installing an IBM-based system in 120 of its outlets.
In Germany, 550 pharmacists are plugged into the Tele-Apotheke
through-the-window marketing system; and in the US Sears Roebuck has
publicised the fact that it expects to make annual savings of Dollars 50m by
cutting 7,000 staff and replacing them with p-o-s systems and interactive
multimedia ordering kiosks.
All this activity so far represents only the tip of an iceberg. If the
analysts' predictions are to come true then more than Dollars 5bn worth of
new applications will need to come on stream in the next four years. That
seems unlikely, but may not be impossible, for the latest multimedia
communications systems being experimented with by high-flying corporations
are multi-faceted, very large and relate to businesses' operational cores.
It is worth considering one case in point: in California, Pacific Bell
recently experimented with a networked multimedia information and training
system, linking 10 sites. Designed to replace 'old' information delivery
systems using video and printed materials, the new Employee Knowledge Link
used a Sun fileserver and workstations connected by ISDN telecom lines to
carry voice, music, sound effects, text, animated images and stills.
The technology used was significant - 'we considered using CD-ROM,' the
project leaders told a US conference held in April, 'but because the time
and cost-concerns with creation, distribution and storage, we decided it was
not the ideal solution.' Yet the core nature of the experiment was, if
anything, more significant. Having already started to break down geographic,
temporal and cost boundaries, multimedia communications could soon make an
impact on the barriers erected between corporate departments, changing the
way businesses are run, as well as the means by which they communicate.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (13): Big business
implications - British companies are leading the way in Europe in applying
EDI - a simple idea that saves time, effort and money / Electronic data
interchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of electronic data interchange (EDI) have been so great to
Tesco, over the last six years that the retail chain has stopped measuring
them against the costs.
'The EDI costs are absolutely negligible and are covered by our savings on
the phone, fax and mail alone,' says stock management director Mr Dave
MacInnis. 'That means we have all the business benefits for nothing.'
Those benefits are impressive: 'We've reduced stock levels yet improved
stock availability and sales; cut lead times on orders; cut administration;
and improved communication with our suppliers.'
Tesco, an EDI pioneer, now trades electronically with over 1,200 companies
of all sizes, representing more than 95 per cent of products on its shelves.
Half these suppliers send their invoices to Tesco by EDI. Tesco has also
used EDI to forge close business relationships with a quarter of them,
sending 13-week sales forecasts to help them schedule production and reduce
stocks - thus keeping their own costs and prices down.
Computer manufacturer ICL is enjoying similar gains by using EDI as a route
to just-in-time ma nufacturing and business process re-organisation,
according to chief executive Mr Peter Bonfield: 'In manufacturing we've
reduced the time from manufacture to invoice from 20 days to three. We've
reduced our inventory by Pounds 100m, with a big impact on the balance sheet
and customer response time. The delivery time for PCs has been cut from four
weeks to 48 hours maximum. Automating our purchasing has reduced our
administration costs by 70 per cent.'
Companies like these have gone way beyond the original EDI idea of
exchanging routine business documents such as orders, acknowledgements and
invoices over telecommunications lines between computers run by customers
and suppliers.
Tesco's experience shows that this in itself is enough to justify EDI, by
reducing the delays and human error which are built into the process of
keying order information into a computer, printing it and mailing the
document to a supplier, where it is keyed in again. This process is repeated
right down through the supply chain. Indeed, it has been estimated that
50-70 per cent of computer output becomes computer input.
The UK is the clear leader in Europe in its use of EDI and the number of
companies trading electronically is growing at 25 per cent a year. But even
so, less than a third of the top 1,000 companies have taken it up. The likes
of ICL and Tesco have cajoled and helped their smaller trading partners into
EDI, taking the total number to around 10,000. But, as Sir John Harvey-Jones
told a recent EDI conference, 'we are barely scratching the surface.'
'Why are we so loath to use the opportunities of electronic trading when it
pays for itself in paperwork savings alone, without the additional business
advantages?' Sir John demanded. He went on to answer his own question,
reflecting the views of leading users, consultants and service suppliers in
this field.
'The real pay-off from information technology only comes when it is used to
totally transform the way business is done and the way a company is
organised. Companies have made a major jump ahead of the competition by
having vision and openness to change.
'However, most companies are still organised in vertical components. Those
that look across the totality of the business are all too few. This is one
reason why getting EDI to really run and show its paces has been such a
problem. It has tended to be looked on as the preserve of the IT department,
not as a valuable enabling tool to change the way that every part of the
organisation does its business.'
He added: 'I pushed ICI into EDI not for the savings per invoice - although
these were respectable - but because I believed EDI was a key to altering
the way our business was done and the relationships we had with our
suppliers and customers.'
EDI is a 'proven strategic vehicle' for business says Ray Walker, chief
executive of SITPRO, the Simpler Trade Procedures Board. He is chairman of
the UK National EDI Conference. The forthcoming EDI 93 event in October (see
details on page four of this survey) is the largest yet.
Most of the growth in EDI has been led by big companies, whether those with
such vision or those simply looking initially at cutting administration
costs. Neil Lawrence, EDI manager at service supplier British Telecom,
believes the number of the top 1,000 companies using EDI will double to
around 600 in the next two or three years - and each will bring in 1,500 or
more of its suppliers.
Meanwhile the UK's main service suppliers - market leader INS, AT&amp;T - Istel,
European leader GEIS, IBM and BT - are trying to make EDI more attractive to
small companies. These suppliers run networks which direct messages from one
company's computer to any other company's system.
'Tesco, Sainsbury's and others are doing sophisticated things and have
transformed their business but we haven't really got to the volume market
yet,' says INS marketing director Colin Billinge.
'The market has become more competitive and we want to stimulate growth
still further by attracting the hundreds of thousands of small firms.'
INS, which has 55 per cent of the UK market, has recently packaged its
network and support services in new ways and cut prices for smaller new
entrants. This month it has launched a software package which enables
companies to adapt quickly to the message formats and procedures of
different trading partners.
Service suppliers are also wooing communities of users and finding unlikely
successes among some of the smallest companies. For example manfacturers of
small electrical appliances, including Braun and Tefal, have set up an EDI
community with local repair shops, some of which are two-man bands with a
personal comp uter working from a market stall. The repair firms send orders
for parts via the British Telecom EDI service, cutting the repair time from
a week or more to 24 hours in many cases.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (11): Out of the

computer is really such a wonderful tool for business, asks Claire Gooding,
why has it been kept behind the scenes for so long?

UNTIL recent years, relatively few top executives had the incentive to have
a computer terminal or PC on their desks. Those who did were in an
enlightened minority, despite the vigorous efforts of the suppliers of
software packages known as executive information systems (EIS).
The first generation of EIS products grew out of more general decision
support software for forecasting and modelling. The main problem they
tackled was that of having too much information, not too little.
Computer systems tended to deliver fat, inflexible reports, through which
few executives were prepared to plough to find the relevant facts.
The EIS promised a slick, flexible alternative, a way of looking at facts on
the screen and drawing information from all the existing data systems in a
company's computers.
The graphical representations of data were flexible, allowing 'drill down '
 -the refining of information down to its source facts - and other
manipulations. There were two 'extras' which distinguished the EIS from its
humbler counterpart, the management information system (MIS). One was the
ease of use: it was presumed that no top executive would ever have the time
to master a keyboard. The other was its links with various systems, not only
the internal accounting and production systems but external links, to
databases and online information services.
In its 'unique selling propositions,' the EIS trod a path that the rest of
the computer industry was to follow. Comshare, the market leader, and other
suppliers including Holos, Acuity and Pilot could offer speedy development
and flexible reactions to changes, presented in a graphical form, even when
the basic data came from the mainframe.
At the heart of the EIS was its flexibility - the ability to turn data
inside out, manipulate it, look at different views of it, and perform 'what
if' exercises.
The rest of the computer industry has now caught up with what made the EIS
so special a few years ago. Rapid applications development and graphical
user interfaces have gone along way towards making applications more
flexible and easier to use. But EIS also foreshadowed another development:
business process re-engineering.
When implementing an EIS, consultants soon discovered that the real effort
went into defining a company's real needs.
Even managers who believed in the benefits of an EIS found it difficult to
answer the basic question 'what do you want from a system?'
To enable an executive to grasp the essentials swiftly, somebody somewhere
has to do a lot of groundwork. The exercise of deciding who needs what
information, why, from whom, when, and how often, throw into relief the
relationships, and particularly the redundant processes in a company. It can
even re-focus an organisation to look at its basic purpose and
profitability.
Better information systems often mean human redundancies: ICI Fibres, for
example, reduced its head office staff from hundreds to a handful. Managing
director Scott Davidson keeps in touch with the dozen or so staff now based
in Brussels via his laptop computer.
The ICI Fibres Business Information System is a model of how an EIS can
evolve. Consultants Executive Information Systems have nursed the system
through various incarnations, working closely with managers from ICI Fibres
and ICI Acrylics.
The system was initially written in PC Express, and later refined using a
mixture of Lightship and Lotus 123. Once everyone was satisfied with the
prototype, the final system took shape in the Focus 4GL from Information
Builders.
The EIS suppliers have shifted their ground a little in recent times,
perhaps aware that their territory is being encroached by less specialist
software. In practice, few executives use external links regularly, and the
main value of EIS has been that corporate users 'all sing from the same hymn
sheet'.
Predictably, the data fed into EIS models is internal, such as sales and
accounts information. EIS has proved to be not a periscope, looking at the
outside world, but a microscope, illuminating internal data.
So, argue the EIS suppliers, the acronym should now stand for 'Enterprise
Information Systems.'
The benefits of a system in which everyone shares should be felt outside the
boardroom. Remote computing, also known as 'teleworking' seems to have
brought a new element into the pattern, giving access to the mainframe, and
to colleagues.
VAG, the UK importer of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles and parts, is one
company that has used an EIS as an 'enterprise' rather than an 'executive'
system.
Part of the Volkswagen Group in Germany, VAG is a marketing and distribution
organisation based in Miltion Keynes. It retails through 300 or so
franchised dealer outlets employing nearly 10,0000 people, and accounting
for turnover exceeding Pounds 1bn in the UK.
A re-examination of productivity and resources in 1991 convinced VAG that it
simply did not have the right information available to enable it to sell its
cars in the fiercely competitive 1990s.
At the time the company was organised in traditional divisions: sales and
marketing, parts and services, each with its own field force.
Steve Underwood, then a manager of information systems, described the
problem: 'In essence the divisions were companies in their own right. There
was very litte interaction between the people selling vehicles and people
selling parts and service.'
The re-organisation focused on getting closer to dealers. Twenty district
managers were to take responsibility for every area of operation in their
local 'patch,' working from home.
'Suddenly the district manager had to be a generalist, with a tremendous
amount of knowledge about all parts of the business,' says Steve Underwood.
He was responsible for setting up a technical solution, an EIS that would
collect all the available information from existing parts, vehicle, and
finance systems on the mainframe, and deliver the information to the
district manager in a useable format.
As with most EIS solutions, this meant a new layer of technology, drawing on
what was alreadu in place. Pilot Software's LightShip was chosen as the
front-end, to give users easy access via 'point and click' windows but also
because of its extensive links with databases and other software products.
The managers use IBM L40 laptops with modems, connected to an OS/2 computer.
This extracts data from the DB/2 mainframe database via an SQL server, using
LightShip's high-speed Lens 'middleware' to search and deliver information
at high speed.
Robert Couldwell, a VAG district manager based in south London, readily
points out the benefits of the system, although he was new to computers and
home-working back in 1991.
'To motivate dealers to achieve sales targets you need information. That
used to rely on lots of telephoning and hard-copy reports delivered by
post,' he says.
'Now I keep in touch with market share, parts performance, and can check up
on the latest figures when I get home at night.'
He stays in touch with the office and colleagues through electronic mail,
and when negotiating sales targets with dealers, the laptop goes with him.
'From the dealer's point of view, the laptop doesn't lie. It's fact, not
conjecture, if you can show the development of market share over the last
three years by each model. That's powerful.'
VAG is among the companies who have made their historical information work
for them, but this is still the exception rather than the rule. When West
London Training Enterprise Council surveyed 719 companies in its area,
ranging from the smallest to the largest, the most common applications were
still the back-room functions of accounting and office automation.
Its most disturbing finding was that business managers are top of the league
table in the matter of IT skills deficiency. EIS suppliers, it seems, still
have to convince the world at large that the computer belongs in the
boardroom. VAG's experience suggests that it might be more useful on the
road, or at home.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (12): Europe points
the way to new standards - Ergonomics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST companies only think about ergonomics when there is evidence that
something, somewhere, is going wrong.
But according to the latest bulletin on the subject from the International
Data Corporation (IDC), ergonomics is about to become a big issue among
employers in Europe. It believes litigation and productivity will bring the
issue to the fore.
IDC analyst Andrew Baul-Lewis points out that more attention is paid to the
ergonomics of the average car than is paid to the comfort of the worker's
desk. Along with other voices in the IT industry, notably ICL and Olivetti,
IDC argues for a broader interpretation of ergonomics, traditionally
associated with engineering issues, the design of screens and visual display
units. There has been a tendency to isolate such things as screen displays
and eye strain as separate issues, without realising that health and safety
affects the whole person, mental and physical.
Ergonomics is a growing standards issue in Europe, where the recent European
Commission directive which came into force on the 1st January 1993. IDC
argues that employers will soon have to take such regulations, along with
the International Standards Organisation's recommendations, into account
when purchasing equipment.
In the US, there is also concern for the environment, and electricity
consumption, promoted by the US Environmental Protection Agency's Energy
Star programme, which is encouraging PC power consumption to be reduced to
30 watts. This concern is beginning to be reflected in European legislation,
such as Germany's law, coming into force in 1994, that makes electronic
suppliers responsible for collecting obsolete equipment.
Hans Malmkvist, director of ICL's ergonomics programme based in Stockhom,
has proof from many Scandinavian companies that ergonomics pays in terms or
productivity and reduced absenteeism. 'There are lots of EC directives, but
the real challenge is to get users to understand and take responsibility for
their own layout,' he says.
ICL's so-called 'Just In Time' training uses the computer to teach in situ,
using self-programmable multimedia techniques, including videos of physical
exercises. Taking the lead from Nokia, acquired by ICL in 1991, ICL now has
'ergonauts', as Malmkvist calls them, advising customers all over Europe.
An enlightened holistic approach would take into account the entire working
environment - surroundings, view, lighting, noise level, seating and
posture, as well as the keyboard and terminal. Software is also coming under
scrutiny, at a time when graphical user interfaces and object-oriented
programming are making products easier to use, but are also creating a
confusing diversity of options.
Software ergonomics are an increasing part of the picture. More end-users
are coming online, and are expected to use a variety of software products.
The frustration of finding that they all use different keyboard conventions
can lead to much time-wasting and unacceptable levels of errors. How
sensible it would be to have a set of accepted rules, similar to those which
established the F1 key as the escape or 'reverse out' route in the earliest
generation of PC applications. But this goes against commercial judgment,
and companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Sun are fighting through the
courts to retain their own individual 'look and feel' on the desktop.
'The problem is litigation,' says Therese Cory, main author of the 1993
Software Quality Report from IT researchers Butler Bloor. 'It would make
more sense, instead of the legal battle for the desktop, for them to agree,
or at least allow, some flexibility.'
Software designers are beginning to appreciate the need for clearer
signposting. It is possible, with graphical user interfaces and
object-oriented programming, for software to be a delight to use. Software
house Unify has just launched its own client-server development software,
Unify Vision, which mimics human thinking by using icons and pointers to
develop 'intuitive' applications. 'It's a matter of productivity and ease of
use' says Reza Mikailli, senior vice-president of products at Unify. 'The
mouse gives you a screen of options and you can jump from one to another:
there is no dictation of the thinking process as with old style systems.
It's a matter of getting closer to people's thinking processes: these can
change fast, so the tools you use to write programs should let you react to
every event. That's what being human is all about.'

vision - Object-oriented technology is reviving an engineering paradigm /
Computer-aided software engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   IN the optimistic mid
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
1980s, computer-aided software engineering (CASE) was heralded as the
panacea to the problems of building complex computer software.
By combining formal design methods and powerful tools, CASE aimed to harness
the computer itself to help create useful applications quickly, easily and
cheaply.
Its most enthusiastic advocates said that CASE would let you model a
business problem, turn a 'handle' and the software for a full-blown IT
application would appear like magic.
This long-term vision of the virtues of CASE remains - despite a growing
realisation that it is not as easy to put into practice as was first
thought.
The fundamental ideas in CASE are sound: engineering discipline is good for
software production and computer power can be used to help to build useful
systems. But the reality is that users have been slow to adopt CASE methods
and, more importantly for the software industry, they have been reluctant to
buy CASE tools.
There are a several reasons for the apparent failure of the CASE vision.
Users were expected to throw out all of their previous development
technology and invest enormous sums in re-training - which was more an act
of faith than a sound business decision.
Their expectations were raised to a level which could only be met by
something miraculous - and CASE was, inevitably, well below this.
Furthermore the technology goalposts moved. In the late 1980s, when good
CASE products for proprietary mainframes and minicomputers first began to
appear, attention switched to open, networked client/server systems.
Such systems use several different types of computer and operating
environment, each with their own idiosyncrasies.
CASE tools could not cope with this change and have only recently begun to
catch up.
Early CASE also put greater emphasis on technology than on business problems
and, in the recessionary climate of recent years, this was a mistake.
There are signs of change, however. CASE methods vendors have learnt to
accommodate older so-called 'legacy' systems.
CASE tool suppliers have extended their products to work with network
systems as targets and the emphasis has switched away from technology to
business problems.
In addition, CASE has received a boost from object-oriented computing.
Both share common roots in engineering principles and complement each other
well: object-oriented computing provides a foundation for defining software
'components' and CASE provides the mechanisms for assembling them into
applications.
'CASE must be related to a business architecture. The older CASE tools were
about throwing systems at chunks of the business rather than seeing the
whole picture,' says Mr Roger Stenson, assistant general manager of Norwich
Union's management services department.
As an experienced user of CASE methods and tools, Norwich Union has had the
chance to assess the value of the technology to its business.
Mr Stenson has no doubts about its long-term value: 'We have to get the
business of writing software away from being an art to being a branch of
engineering,' he says.
'But there is still some way to go and the technology needs to mature.'
Norwich Union's main CASE tool is Knowledgeware's Application Development
Workbench (ADW) which maintains the business model used as the basis for
application systems. It also uses Bachman Information System's data
modelling tools and Softlab's Maestro CASE project management package.
'Nobody's got all of it. You have to a framework which takes in a variety of
tools,' says Mr Stenson.
The best-known CASE framework is IBM's Application Development (AD)/Cycle
which aimed to put IBM squarely in the CASE software market along with
third-party suppliers who supplied appropriate tools.
AD/Cycle has not lived up to IBM's hopes - partly as a result of changes in
the structure of its own market and partly because the opportunity has not
been fully exploited. AD/Cycle is restricted to generating applications for
IBM hardware only and this has reduced its chances of success in the open
networked computing environment of today.
'Although it has some sound ideas in it, AD/Cycle has not been very
successful for IBM. We have our own framework and we have kept compatible
with AD/Cycle where possible. We want to keep our options open,' says Mr
Stenson.
Despite its high hopes for AD/Cycle, IBM has had problems building one of
the key components - the data 'repository.' CASE tools need a repository to
hold data about the business model, the relationships between systems and
even the technology of the system itself. Development delays and the lack of
repository sales has undoubtedly held AD/Cycle back.
Other manufacturers have been less ambitious than IBM - but claim greater
success. Amdahl, which makes IBM-compatible hardware for the mainframe
market, was an early pioneer of CASE techniques with its Huron system.
'Huron is a set of tools which helps to manage software change. It has a
repository at the centre where a single copy of the business model is kept.
This keeps track of change in the business and the applications,' explains
Mr John Paton, European sales and marketing director for the Antares
Alliance Group, a CASE joint venture between Amdahl and software company
EDS.
'We see facilitating change as the main role of CASE. Without the ability to
re-engineer their processes easily, users start to believe it is so
difficult that they can't change,' he goes on.
Relating the use of CASE directly to the business has become essential -
both in order to justify the application of technology and to maintain the
overall integrity of the business model.
'In the past, CASE has been seen as methods based when it should be mission
based. You have to remove anything that distracts from the business
mission,' says Mr Paton.
He adds that object-oriented computing is the key: 'It is much easier to see
real world systems in terms of objects and it is not difficult for business
people to define the objects that they have to deal with. It is only when
the technologists get involved that things get complicated. Object-oriented
computing makes it easier for the technologist and the business managers
think in the same way.'
In addition to being able to provide this direct link between business
problems and the system, object-oriented technology shares the same
engineering principles as CASE and will revive interest.
'CASE was oversold in the 1980s. People saw it as a silver bullet and
expected the tools to give them a development process. We now see that you
need the process first. Object technology helps us to identify this,' says
Mr Don Kavanagh, a consultant with CASE tool supplier Interactive Data
Environments, (IDE).
'Object let us gain a higher level understanding of the business problem and
relate that back to the technology, he adds.
Object-oriented technology is also having an impact on users too. Mr Stenson
of Norwich Union is enthusiastic: 'The entire future of software is
object-oriented and I fully endorse it. It the most critical component of
where we are going with CASE. We just need more mature tools to realise the
potential,' he says.

FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (10): 'Intuitive'
Newton launched
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer has launched the first product based on its Newton technology
 -the Newton 'MessagePad.' This hand-held communications aid, pictured
right, is designed to allow users to collect, organise and distribute
information with ease and spontaneity.
The MessagePad 'learns' the user's handwriting and work patterns - and then
implements them on cue over a short period of time. Whether it is printing a
letter or faxing a message, the product learns to anticipate the user's
needs. With an optional connection package, users can transfer, synchronise,
back-up and update information between the MessagePad and a personal
computer. Apple plans to introduce wireless messaging and electronic mail
facilities for the product.

READING this FT survey on the train might make good use of your commuting
time. If, that is, you are not already busy with your laptop and portable
modem.
Even better, you could cut out commuting altogether by becoming a teleworker
(see the case studies on page eight of this survey).
The suggestion regarding teleworking is now promoted with fervour by British
Telecom, which cites productivity improvements of up to 40 per cent for home
workers. A job in data processing of any sort used to presume a fairly
sedentary sort of life, probably spent in a data centre somewhere, and all
too often in a basement. A pretty view, and flexible working hours were low
on the list of probabilities. But increasingly, the pressures in the
computer industry and such movements as downsizing, enterprise-wide
networking and client-server computing have forced organisations to look at
de-centralisation.
While this has been seen as the death-knell of the traditional 'dp' centre,
(a rumour much exaggerated) it actually creates a number of new
opportunities for people in the IT industry and beyond. As computers become
'distributed', so do people, and work opportunities.
Networking used to concentrate on the sharing of scarce and expensive
hardware resources, such as printers. Now the emphasis is on saving labour
costs, and companies are looking at contracting out centralised computer
facilities. This can bring a saving on office-space, and also on employment
costs including workspace, national insurance, and pension contributions.
The network has become a notional as well as a technical vehicle, and
employees are being enabled and encouraged to work at home. Flexible working
in a wider sense offers further savings, and the idea of teleworking,
particularly contracting out to freelancers, is not far behind.
In any work involving computers, there has to be a distinction between those
who do it all day, every day, like software developers, and those for whom
using a computer is only a part of the job.
So far, only a fifth of the UK working population use computers, as compared
to around half in Sweden. The computer industry was among the first to
capitalise on home-working for software developers. But it is increasingly
likely that any job - clerical, publishing, selling, banking - will depend
on being able to use a computer.
The technology is readily available, and a number of recent launches such as
Apple's Newton, and Tricom's Pearl portable fax/modem have recognised that
computing on the move is no gimmick, but part of many people's working
pattern. BT is beginning to put ISDN in place for high-speed data
transmission and services such as voice and videophones. Some areas, such as
the Highlands of Scotland, have have been quick to put it to stake a claim
in the remote service market. (See case study, page eight).
The Henley Centre for Forecasting has calculated that over a sixth of the
hours worked in the UK would be worked at home by the mid-90s; more than
3.3m people by 1995.
British Telecom, admittedly with a vested interest in teleworking, claims
that a central London employer can save Pounds 2m a year by teleworking 100
senior people.
MAKING A VIRTUE OUT OF A NECESSITY
Sales organisations have been quick to make a virtue out of necessity. Out
of several 'business process re-engineering' projects has come the single
message: to save costs, re-organise, consolidate separate activities under
one local area manager, and send people home, armed with laptops. Unipart,
in the automative industry, and Sun Alliance, in the insurance business,
have been among the large organisations taking this seriously. But if there
is to be a large 'connectable' workforce, there are several issues to
address, each illustrated by the very different stories here.
One is remote training, which will become more a of a necessity as large
organisations refuse to bear the costs of training in old-style 'dp'
centres.
There has to be a way of delivering education by computer. Bulletin boards,
for group-wide communication, have kept students at the Wolsey Hall Open
Learning Centre in touch with one another and with tutors.
Ace-High, the Highlands consortium, has taken an innovative approach to
remote training, just as successful and more suited to the workflow now
shared between its first proteges. For the Hollister Group, the problem was
completely different. The work had to go to where the skilled people were
already settled, and teleworking was the only option. Finding equipment easy
to use was the main priority, and the Macintosh offered just that. Apple
Computer, developer of the Macintosh and the Newton, is one of the main
contributors to the Teleworking movement, both in the Telecottage
Association, and in the high-tech community in Kington, Herefordshire. This
is a pilot scheme, known as 'Connected Community,' to see what potential
benefits can be provided for the social fabric of small towns.
The aim is to generate n ew business and employment opportunities,
especially for disabled people and women returners. BT and the Rural
Development Commission are supporting the experiment, which is to be
monitored by the Henley Centre.
There are also some moral and personal issues which arise from teleworking,
not shirked by British Telecom in its comprehensive information pack, the
Teleworking Programme, (call 0700 800 854 for free copies).
BT points out that teleworking can be disruptive to other people in the
home, and that it does not suit gregarious people whose main pleasure in
work is the social life. Computer manufacturer and service company
Hewlett-Packard has already addressed another issue of personal safety, by
its co-operation with the Susie Lamplugh Trust, the personal safety
awareness organisation set up in memory of the estate agent who disappeared
whilst keeping a professional appointment in a house.
Another active body in the area is MSF, the white-collar union, whose
concerns include employment rights. Health and safety - particularly in
terms of ergonomics and a suitable working environment - is a responsibility
which gets passed down to remote teleworkers, who may not be aware of the
importance of vdu regulations and guidelines, the correct adjustment of
chair height, and precautions to be taken in using a computer.
More information on teleworking is available in the most recent issue of the
FT review, 'Software At Work,' published on September 8.
THE NEXT ISSUE OF SOFTWARE AT WORK
The Winter Issue is due for publication on Monday, November 29. It will
include two user-based reports, on office automation and geographical
information systems (GIS).
The hot topic in this issue will be is Object Oriented Programming.
Questionnaires for those wishing to participate in the user-research are
available from the Surveys Department, Financial Times, Number 1, Southwark
Bridge, London SE1 9HL.
In particular, the section on Office Automation (Part 1) will focus on:
Integration: Users no longer find any novelty in mere word processing. They
are looking for better and more effective ways of integrating other
applications with the routine paperwork.
Word processing is no longer standalone, but has become linked with
database, communications, and spreadsheets.
Users are less likely to be confronted with a choice between one package or
another on the basis of pure functions. Nowadays they are more likely to be
concerned with exchanging documents and formats, regulating in-house
standards and usages, and keeping in-house training up to date with new
versions.
The management of software - and human - resources is likely to play an
important part in the office automation stories we tell.
GIS - Geographical Information Systems: these systems for mapping
geographical information used to be be a niche market, relevant only to
specialist users. Programs such as the route-mapping program AutoRoute have
now found their way into people's homes, and helped awareness of the larger
potential of GIS.
Commercial applications are now becoming appealing for corporations in such
areas as research and marketing, especially as the availability of CD-ROM
has made demographic and other high-volume detailed information readily
available.
The hot topic - Object Oriented Programming: the latest buzzword for the
programming community leaves most non-technical people bewildered. Software
At Work will explain what it means, what it will enable users to do, and why
most people don't really need to know more than that.
