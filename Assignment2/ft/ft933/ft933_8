FT  20 SEP 93 / Hamburg voters snub establishment

THE VOTERS of Hamburg last night delivered a resounding snub to the ruling
coalition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and to the opposition Social Democrats,
in a clear indication of popular anger with the German political
establishment.
The winners in the city election campaign were all the protest parties, led
by the Greens, who almost doubled their support from 7.1 per cent in the
last election to 13.5 per cent last night.
A non-political citizens' protest party, called the Statt (Instead) Partei,
won eight seats in the 121-member Hamburg parliament with a vote of 5.7 per
cent.
To universal relief, the extreme right-wing Republicans failed to win any
seats by the narrowest of margins, gaining 4.9 per cent support - just below
the 5.0 per cent needed to enter the assembly.
Both Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, with a slump from 35 to 25 per
cent support in the election, and the SPD suffered their worst poll results
in the city since the second world war.
The setback to the ruling establishment was confirmed by a disastrous result
for the liberal Free Democratic party, the minority partner in Mr Kohl's
Bonn coalition, which will lose all its seats in the parliament. Its support
tumbled from 5.4 to 4.1 per cent.
The Hamburg city election, called two years early after the CDU was found
guilty of undemocratic methods of selecting its party candidates in 1991, is
the first of no fewer than 20 national, state and local elections in the
next 13 months.
The SPD, which has ruled Hamburg virtually without interruption for 46
years, ended the night with 40.4 per cent support, compared with 48 per cent
in 1991, giving it 58 seats in the parliament. It has therefore lost its
absolute majority of one seat, and will now have to negotiate - either with
the CDU, the Greens, or the Statt party - to form a coalition city
government.
The collapse in the CDU vote was the biggest surprise of the night. Mr
Kohl's party was clearly one of the main losers to the Statt party, which
was formed by dissident Christian Democrats. The FDP also lost support to
the non-party protesters.
The result for the Republicans was clearly a disappointment for the party,
which had been slipping in recent opinion polls. However, the total
far-right vote, including the German People's Union (DVU), reached almost 10
per cent. The result for the extremists suggests their overall support has
peaked.
Mr Henning Voscherau, the Hamburg lord mayor and SPD party leader in
Hamburg, must now decide with whom to negotiate a coalition city government.
The most likely outcome is a coalition with the Greens, who campaigned
openly in favour of such an outcome.

Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic at the weekend cast doubt over whether
he would endorse a plan for the republic's partition after mediators failed
to win concessions from Serb and Croat leaders, writes Laura Silber in
Belgrade.
'Peace is everybody's dream in Bosnia-Hercegovina, but not peace at any
price,' Mr Izetbegovic said.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, had
accelerated their efforts to clinch a deal between the three leaders of
Bosnia's rival communities.
But Lord Owen was quoted as saying that, if there was no sign of a
breakthrough, a meeting scheduled for tomorrow might not take place.

GEORGIA teetered yesterday between slender peace hopes and fears of
worsening civil war as its leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, issued a
desperate plea for outside help, Reuter reports from Sukhumi.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported that Georgian and Abkhazian
representatives signed an unexpected agreement to withdraw their forces from
the war zone in Abkhazia, where fresh fighting last week shattered a
seven-week-old peace deal.
But the agency reported almost simultaneously that Abkhazian separatist
forces had broken through to the outskirts of Sukhumi, the government-held
regional centre.
Earlier, Mr Shevardnadze called on Russia and the west to help stop the
rebels. He said his country was 'being pushed to the abyss'.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Polish Elections: Poland's old guard lures rural voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE APPLEBAUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAKLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND, whose successful free-market reforms are the toast of the western
financial community, was projected to give the largest number of votes in
yesterday's election to left-wing parties, writes Anne Applebaum in Naklo.
To understand why, it helps to visit Naklo, a provincial town of 15,000
people in western Poland.
In Naklo - which has an old market square, a single cinema, a museum which
displays memorabilia from the last war and not much else - the advantages of
communism's demise seem scarce. Few people here care much about the freedom
to travel or the freedom of the press, which have enhanced life for
residents of larger cities. 'Ach, there are so many newspapers to choose
from,' said a man queueing at a news stand yesterday.
The disadvantages, however, are clear. A series of regional financial
scandals have created much resentment; the word 'thieves' has been scrawled
on election posters of free-market parties.
Like other towns of comparable size, Naklo's economy depends on small,
state-owned agricultural enterprises, including a sugar factory and several
meat packing plants. Whereas larger state enterprises in more important
centres attracted government sympathy and foreign investment, cuts in
agricultural subsidies and increased imports have forced many of these small
companies to dismiss workers in the name of efficiency. Now, 23 per cent of
Naklo's inhabitants are unemployed.
Yet even those who have managed to find new jobs seem to resent making the
effort. In small towns people dislike change, even when it appears to have
left them better off.
'I am voting for the old communists because the brick factory I used to work
in was ruined by privatisation,' said one Naklo man, whose grocery shop did
not exist four years ago.
Down the street, in a shop selling imitation Teflon frying pans and plastic
cutlery, the proprietor said he would vote for the Polish Peasant's party
(PSL), formerly allied to the Communist party, because his nine-acre farm
had been put out of business by the economic reforms. 'The Peasant's party
will give bigger credits to farmers, and then I can go back to farming.'
None of those questioned believed the former communists and their allies
represented a new form of social democracy.
'I am voting for the former communists because they represent the old
nomenklatura, and I am a member of the old nomenklatura,' said one
policeman.
Those who support economic reform at the national level have done a poor job
of marshalling support in the town. Although the former communists still
have a local cell, few of the other political parties have local activists;
although Warsaw newspapers have changed ownership in recent years, the
regional press remains in the hands of former communists.
So while the former communists represent a clear, familiar option to the
inhabitants of the town, the many parties which descend from the former
dissident movement represent a confusing cornucopia of ideas, ideals and
leaders. In Naklo, the tiny group of anti-communist intellectuals, once
united by their membership of Solidarity, are now divided and disoriented.
Thus Mr Janusz Wybranski, a former Solidarity leader, is standing for
parliament on the ticket of the Centre Alliance, a descendant of
Solidarity's right wing, because he believes his Christian democratic ideals
are closest to the old movement.
But Mr Janusz Chrzaszcz, a local art collector who suffers from Chekhovian
frustration at the absence of intelligent conversation in the town, said he
supported the Democratic Union, a party linked with former dissidents which
he sees as the party for intellectuals. His wife, meanwhile, chose the
Labour Union, the left wing of the old Solidarity movement, because she
believes in higher pensions for old people.
Even priests, once the most effective opponents of communism in Poland, can
no longer offer clear advice. On election day the local church was
overflowing. At the end of mass, those standing at the back strained to hear
the priest's electoral advice.
'There are many people running for Poland's parliament who oppose our
national traditions and faith, people who are anti-religious and
anti-church,' he said. 'Please keep this in mind as you vote.'
While that could be construed as advice to vote against the former
communists, it could also be interpreted as opposition to those former
dissidents who support abortion rights and oppose religion in schools.
Perhaps that explains why church-goers walking towards the polling booths
professed support for no less than six different parties.
But the habits of communism are still strong; many of Naklo's inhabitants
were not voting at all. Sitting at a local bar one young man said he did not
care to go to the polling booths. 'I am unemployed so I am not interested in
politics,' he said. 'In any case, I don't see what politics have to do with
Naklo.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPE-WIDE scheme to guarantee the young unemployed skills and work
experience will be put forward today by Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs
commissioner.
In a speech in Barcelona to European employment agency advisers, Mr Flynn
will call for 'mainstream Community funding' to complement national schemes
for unemployed school-leavers, which he refers to as a new 'lost
generation'.
'We must stop this rot. If we do not, Europe's future into the 21st century
is one of irreversible decline and social disintegration, Mr Flynn says.
The scheme would be targeted on the 5m youngsters in the EC with no
secondary school or vocational qualification, whose chances of getting a job
are four times worse than that of their peers.
Mr Flynn wants Community backing 'to reinvent the notion of apprenticeship
Europe-wide.'
His Youth Start scheme, if it won support from the Commission and member
states, would be introduced at national level but co-ordinated at European
level, in co-operation with governments, companies, unions, education and
training organisations.
It would also be cross-border, with participants taking part in work and
training projects, including learning languages, for six to nine months in
other EC countries. Mr Flynn singles out environmental protection, urban
regeneration and cultural projects as particular areas where it could be
focused.
The commissioner's advisers acknowledge this is 'by no means a fully-fledged
policy proposal,' but that 'we want to see what sort of reaction we get'.
'All this would cost money,' Mr Flynn acknowledges, but 'there is also a
huge cost attached to doing nothing. More than anything at this stage, I am
looking for political commitment to do better by our youth.'

MR Steffen Heitmann, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's candidate for federal
president when the post is vacated next year, yesterday came under criticism
from the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition, for
remarks he made about the Holocaust, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
In an interview with the Suddeutsche Zeitung daily, Mr Heitmann, justice
minister of the eastern state of Saxony, said: 'The time has come - now that
the post-war period is finally over after German unification - to put this
event (the Nazi period) in its proper place.' He said the killing of 6m Jews
by the Nazis was a unique event, but that Germany 'must not have a special
role until the end of time'.
The Christian Social Union, sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union, still has to decide whether to back the CDU's candidate. But the
controversy surrounding Mr Heitmann may persuade the Free Democrats to apply
more pressure on Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, to
stand, despite his reluctance.

FT  20 SEP 93 / EC labour costs to fall below Japan: Survey shows Europe
narrowing gap with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE European Com-munity hourly labour costs will this year fall below
those in Japan for the first time, and Europe is also narrowing the gap with
the US, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's annual survey of
European labour costs.
The survey, based on production workers in manufacturing, casts some doubt
on the growing pessimism about Europe's ability to compete in world markets.
But the favourable trend for European hourly wage costs is largely due to
the strength of the yen and the dollar and European wages are still expected
to rise faster than in the US or Japan this year. The survey predicts a rise
of 4.9 per cent in Europe, down from 5.7 per cent in 1992, compared with 3.2
per cent in the US and 2.8 per cent in Japan.
The survey also finds that western Germany's wage cost problem is
deteriorating further. The country tops the league table with an hourly
average of Dollars 25.34, well ahead of Switzerland on Dollars 22.48. The
problem is compounded by the strength of the D-Mark against other European
currencies.
In contrast Britain's labour costs will drop to an hourly average of Dollars
12.90 this year, less than half the German rate and a third lower than the
European average. The UK is placed 12th in the table of 16 western European
countries at the lower end of the 'Europe medium' cost band which is headed
by France, moving ahead of Italy and Finland.
The 'Europe high' group in order of cost is: western Germany, Switzerland,
Norway, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria. The Europe
'medium group' is France, Italy, Finland, UK, Ireland and Spain, while the
Europe 'low group' is Greece and Portugal, with the latter on Dollars 4.69
per hour.
'While France has pursued a 'franc fort' policy, Italy has been able to reap
the benefits of currency devaluation following the lira's suspension from
the ERM last year. The UK figures suggest that a similar pattern is emerging
for Britain', says Mr Graham Hatton, director of the survey.
The survey takes account of all direct payments made to employees, including
overtime, bonuses and holiday pay, plus non-wage costs incurred by employers
such as health and social insurance costs.
On that basis, average weighted EC labour costs will be Dollars 18.64 an
hour this year - a 6.5 per cent decline since last year in dollar terms -
compared with Dollars 16.58 in the US, up 7 per cent year-on-year, and
Dollars 19.05 in Japan, up 18 per cent. For western Europe, including
several non-EC European countries, the figure is Dollars 19.08.
The gap between European and US labour costs will narrow to 15 per cent in
1993, against 26 per cent the previous year.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Doubts surround Yeltsin agreement on early poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has appeared to agree to an early
presidential election but has left open the timing of the poll and the law
under which it would be held.
His decision at the weekend to call elections contradicts earlier statements
that he wished to serve out his term of office to 1996. However, it is
unlikely that elections can be held this autumn as there is no majority
among regional leaders and the time is too short to prepare for the poll.
Parliament must approve the calling of elections, and as yet there is no
agreed electoral law, no deal between the presidency and the parliament on
the division of powers and no agreed draft constitution.
Mr Yeltsin also moved to strengthen his position at the weekend by issuing a
decree confirming Mr Yegor Gaidar as first deputy premier, appointing Mr
Nikolai Golushko as security minister and putting Mr Yuri Skokov, a close
ally, in the powerful role of secretary of the Security Council.
Mr Gaidar has repeatedly underscored the need to curb state spending to
bring inflation and the budget deficit under control. However, in a call for
lower taxation he appears to conflict with the stated aims of Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance.
Mr Yeltsin also stripped General Alexander Rutskoi, the dissident
vice-president, of his one remaining right - to stand in for Mr Yeltsin
during his absence from the country.
Mr Yeltsin is to continue his series of high-profile visits to military
units based near Moscow. In the past fortnight he has visited tank,
paratroop and Interior Ministry bases.

<TEXT>
THE British defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, is seeking clarification
from Moscow and Kiev about the recent agreement for Ukraine to hand over to
Russia its strategic nuclear weapons and its share of the Black Sea naval
fleet.
Mr Rifkind arrived in Moscow yesterday. In the first visit by a UK defence
minister since the break-up of the Soviet Union, he will meet defence chiefs
from both countries this week.
Mr Rifkind said the agreement earlier this month between President Boris
Yeltsin and Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk left open several crucial
questions including the timetable for the transfers and how the agreements
were to be ratified.
The nuclear agreement covers 176 intercontinental missiles as well as
air-launched weapons based in Ukraine.
Mr Rifkind said the missiles themselves, as distinct from the warheads, also
needed clarifying.
Discussions will also focus on joint peace-keeping efforts and Russian
attitudes to peace-keeping in former Soviet territories. It was important
that any Russian participation should come under an international mandate,
Mr Rifkind said.
An agreement on UK assistance for resettling former members of the Russian
armed forces is due to be signed today

In an interview with the Suddeutsche Zeitung daily, Mr Heitmann, justice

Mr Hermann Otto Solms, parliamentary leader of the Free Democrats, told the

has really understood the people of our country and German history'.
Mr Heitmann's remarks on the Holocaust follow last week's controversial
comments challenging ratification of the Maastricht treaty. In an interview
with El Pais, the Spanish daily newspaper, Mr Heitmann was reported to have
said the Maastricht treaty had been 'imposed' on European Community
countries.
'It was not a result of a big debate over European unification, but it was
ordered from above.'
The Christian Social Union, sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic

<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic at the weekend cast doubt over whether
he would endorse a plan for the republic's partition after international
mediators failed to win concessions from Serb and Croat leaders.
'Peace is everybody's dream in Bosnia-Hercegovina, but not peace at any
price,' Mr Izetbegovic told Sarajevo radio on Saturday.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators,
accelerated their efforts at the weekend to clinch a deal between the three
leaders of Bosnia's rival communities.
'If there is no sign of getting signatures on the agreement then the meeting
(tomorrow) may not take place,' Lord Owen was quoted as saying. Mr
Izetbegovic, a Moslem, played down speculation that he would sign the
'compromise' package dividing Bosnia into three ethnic republics unless his
mostly Moslem mini-state received more land.
'What was offered in Geneva we rejected and we will reject again if they
make the same offer,' he said. 'I personally don't see it and I told Owen
that.'
But Serb and Croat leaders at the weekend reiterated their refusal to cede
any more land than already agreed at the Geneva peace talks.
The peace envoys met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the Bosnian Croat
leader, Mr Mate Boban, in an attempt to persuade them to give the Moslems
access to Adriatic ports.
But Mr Boban dismissed any possibility of giving up Neum, a fishing port on
Bosnia's patch of Adriatic coastline. 'We will never concede any Croatian
territory,' he said.
Fighting appeared to subside yesterday after separate ceasefires came into
effect. But Sarajevo radio reported that 15 people were killed and 27
injured in south-western Mostar, where 50,000 Moslems are under a Croat
siege.

FT  20 SEP 93 / BMW Rolls-Royce in talks on new engine for DC9s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine joint venture between the UK power group
and the German luxury carmaker, is in talks with McDonnell Douglas of the US
to provide new engines for old DC9 jets.
The programme, which may initially involve up to 150 of the twin-engine
airliners built 25 years ago, would represent a breakthrough for BMW
Rolls-Royce in its efforts to develop a BR700 family of engines ranging from
12,000lb to 22,000lb thrust to power corporate jets and regional 100-seat
airliners.
The three-year-old joint venture has won orders from Gulfstream and Canadair
to power new business jets with its 15,000lb thrust BR710 engine.
The two companies see a bigger market in the 100-120 seat airliner sector
for its more powerful 20,000lb thrust BR715 engine.
Apart from the DC9 negotiations with McDonnell Douglas, the joint venture is
also planning to offer the BR715 to power the proposed twin-engine RJX
regional jet, which British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace are considering
developing in their new joint venture.
BMW Rolls-Royce executives have held preliminary talks with Taiwan Aerospace
and are offering Taiwan some component manufacturing if the BR715is
eventually selected for the RJX.
The talks with McDonnell Douglas follow the US group's decision to offer
financially weaker airlines an upgraded DC9 as a cheaper alternative to
acquiring new aircraft.
The upgrade, which would involve new engines meeting more stringent noise
and emission standards as well as new cockpit avionics, would stretch the
life of the DC9 by 15 years.
It would provide a new approach to helping financially strapped airlines to
finance their fleet renewal programmes, since a fully refurbished DC9 is
expected to cost about Dollars 18m (Pounds 11.6m), against Dollars
30m-Dollars 35m for a new twin-engine 100-120 seater.
McDonnell Douglas is already in advanced negotiations with Air Canada and
Finnair to upgrade a total of 42 DC9s. The two airlines are expected to
decide whether to accept the DC9 offer or buy new aircraft by the end of
this year. Other airlines with large DC9 fleets include Northwest with 147,
USAir with 73, Continental with 34, TWA with 46 and SAS with 36.
Overall, there are nearly 750 DC9s which will have to be either upgraded to
meet new standards or be replaced with new aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas is seeking to maintain its share of the twin-engine
airliner market with this programme, against intense competition from
Boeing, which recently launched the 737X, and the European Airbus A320.
Boeing is developing the faster, longer-range 737X as a replacement for
older 737s as well as an eventual replacement for DC9s.
Rolls-Royce and its partners in the International Aero Engine consortium,
which manufactures the V2500 engine, have decided not to compete for 737X
business against the Franco-American CFM International partnership of GE and
Snecma, which has long dominated the 737 market.
Sir Ralph Robins, the Rolls-Royce chairman, said: 'We saw no point in
entering the 737X competition.'

FT  20 SEP 93 / Poland returns ex-communists to prominent role: Disillusion
with market-led economic reforms revives fortunes of leftwing parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLISH voters yesterday opted for a slowdown in the pace of market-led
economic reforms by sweeping the disgraced former communists back into a
prominent political role as the largest single party in the next parliament.
First results reported early today by Polish television indicated that the
Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) had increased its share of the vote from 12
per cent to 19.5 per cent since the last elections in October 1991.
What may prove to be lengthy negotiations over a new coalition government
are expected to start today. As the polls closed SLD leaders hinted that
they would be prepared to enter a coalition only if the Democratic Union
(UD), the mainstream party of the fragmented Solidarity movement, agreed to
participate.
They indicated that they would stay in opposition rather than join a
coalition made up entirely of leftwing parties which would be politically
vulnerable and unlikely to deliver any economic improvement in the short
term.
However, as the night drew on, the possibility of a leftwing government
strengthened. The early returns suggested that the SLD and another party
with its roots in the communist past, the Polish Peasants Party (PSL), might
together hold nearly 300 seats in the 460-seat lower house.
The PSL was in second place with 15.1 per cent of the vote after winning
strong support from Poland's disgruntled rural voters.
Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, said: 'We are elastic. We are
ready for talks which should be quick and energetic.'
The UD of Ms Hanna Suchocka, outgoing prime minister, was relegated to third
place with 12.1 per cent. It was followed by the leftwing Union of Labour,
another Solidarity-based party, had 6.6 per cent.
The two main parties datingback to the communist era - the SLD and PSL  -
managed to capitalise on the resentments of public-sector workers,
pensioners and the 2.8m unemployed who feel they have failed to share in the
new wealth created by the booming private sector.
The expected results will send a discouraging message to market reformers in
Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states struggling against
conservative forces linked to the former Soviet system.
They also send a warning signal to potential foreign investors and the
foreign commercial banks that are seeking to impose tough conditions for the
rescheduling of Poland's Dollars 12bn bank debt.
Five smaller parties are hovering around the 5 per cent share of the
national vote required for entry into the 460-seat lower house of
parliament, the Sejm.
The fate of the minor parties, whose presence in the new parliament would
increase the capacity of the post-communist-era politicians to form a
coalition that would leave the SLD in opposition, will become known when the
votes are counted later this week.
The small parties include the Non-party Movement for Reform supported by
President Lech Walesa, the rightwing nationalist Confederation for an
Independent Poland and the free-market Liberal Democratic Congress.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Rivals put Pounds 115m into bids to host Olympics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTENDERS to stage the 2000 Olympic Games have poured well over Pounds 115m
into an unprecedented global lobbying battle which reaches a climax this
week in Monaco.
The campaign has broken all records for the intensity and emotion, the
resources and ingenuity invested in winning the votes of the 91
International Olympic Committee delegates. The figure excludes the large
amounts spent by China, which has not provided expenditure figures.
The five rivals - favourites Sydney and Beijing, along with Manchester,
Berlin and Istanbul - present their final arguments to the IOC on Thursday.
They have already gone to great lengths to impress one of the world's most
courted electorates, spending more than Pounds 1m per delegate on promotion.
China has lent a priceless 2,200-year-old life-size terracotta warrior to
the new Olympic museum in Lausanne - a project dear to the heart of Mr Juan
Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic Committee's president.
Daimler-Benz, the German motor group and a leading sponsor of the Berlin
bid, will make its presence felt on Thursday by providing 40 limousines and
12 buses for the meeting.
Delegates have been flown around the world to assess the sites and have
stayed at first-class hotels. Seventy-nine of the IOC's 91 members have
visited Manchester, while 66 have visited Sydney. A group of five-star
Australian hoteliers provided ADollars 1m of accommodation.
Behind the scenes, big business is thought to have played influential roles
in the campaigns. Large sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Kodak and IBM are
thought to be unanimous in wanting Beijing. An IOC official said: 'It will
give them astonishing presence and contacts in the only world market
experiencing double-digit growth.'
Governments are also pegging their reputations to the bids. Mr John Major,
Mr Paul Keating and Mrs Tansu Ciller, the British, Australian and Turkish
prime ministers, are expected to take part in the Monaco presentations.
Giant banners extolling their cities' virtues hang from the side of the
Manchester headquarters of Granada TV, and flutter from the Sydney Harbour
Bridge. Istanbul's slogan - 'Let's Meet Where the Continents Meet' is
plastered all over the Turkish city. An IOC evaluation report this summer
placed Sydney first and Manchester second in terms of the technical merits
of their facilities.
But the prize for the most thorough promotion has already gone to Beijing.
The early release from jail last week of Wei Jingsheng, China's most
celebrated dissident, appeared an effort to allay human rights anxieties.
While not matching China's extravagance, Manchester, backed by Pounds 5.5m
in promotional funding from the UK government and leading companies, has
pursued an energetic campaign with smaller businesses giving Pounds 2.5m in
kind.
In Sydney, the cost of promotion is close to ADollars 25m (Pounds 10.3m) and
the private sector has contributed about ADollars 14m.

FT  20 SEP 93 / Major set for showdown with rebels: PM urges his rightwing
critics to stop the squabbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, TORQUAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday admitted that rightwing critics
of his leadership were undermining the government's authority.
Mr Major's startlingly frank call for party unity, to allow the government
to function normally, confirmed that the future of his leadership would be
the dominant theme of the autumn party conference season.
It sets the scene for a showdown with the rightwing rebels at next month's
party conference which will be a crucial test of Mr Major's leadership.
Speaking in Tokyo, where he is on a four-day official visit, Mr Major left
no doubt that his patience with the rebels had run out: 'It is time to cut
out this stupid internecine squabbling and get on with the job the country
elected us to do. That is their job, as well as mine.'
Mr Major's decision to tackle his critics confirms that their persistent
sniping is beginning to wear him down, despite official attempts to belittle
them.
Mr Major warned the rebels that the leadership controversy had to end to
allow his government to work properly: 'When decisions need to be taken, and
those decisions are in the interests of the British people, then I have the
right to ask for the support of parliament, particularly the support of my
party. That is what I intend to do.'
Mr Major plans a showdown with the right at the Conservative party
conference in Blackpool which he believes he will win easily. He said: 'The
Conservative party in the country is sick and tired of these distractions,
and I think they will show that at the conference.'
The television interviews were intended as the first shot in a battle for
control of the Conservative party which Mr Major began planning during his
holiday in Portugal last month.
Mr Major's call for unity was backed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
who dismissed as 'silly' and 'irrelevant' speculation that Mr Major faces a
leadership challenge in November.
Mr Clarke, regarded as the clear frontrunner in any battle for the
succession, poured scorn on the idea that he had been jostling for position
with Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the
chief secretary to the Treasury. The chancellor said that Mr Major had the
unanimous backing of the cabinet and the firm support of the 'vast majority'
of Conservative MPs.
In typically robust form, Mr Clarke admitted on BBC Radio that the
government remained in the 'dreadful hole' he had first alluded to in early
summer. He warned again that he could not rule out further tax increases in
his November Budget.
Mr Clarke also refused to contemplate scrapping or scaling back the
government's intention to impose value added tax on domestic fuel despite a
weekend Mori opinion survey showing a backlash against the tax among party
activists. He said any change to the VAT plan would smack of 'weak
government'.
Mr Major offered an olive branch to his critics this morning in a speech
which dwelt on his vision for Europe - a main irritant in his battle with
the right.
Using language calculated to appeal to Euro-sceptic disciples of Lady
Thatcher, former prime minister, he said the European Community must 'take
account of the national identity, old cultures and proudly held traditions
of Europe's members'.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Glaxo wins lawsuit on Zantac patent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's largest drugs company, yesterday won its crucial lawsuit
against Novopharm of Canada over the US patents for Zantac, the world's
best-selling medicine.
Zantac, an ulcer treatment, is vital to the UK group. In the last financial
year it generated sales of Pounds 2.17bn, equivalent to 44 per cent of group
turnover. About half Zantac's sales are in the US.
The case was brought by Glaxo after Novopharm, a manufacturer of generic
(unbranded) drugs, sought government permission to make generic Zantac. The
Canadian group had challenged Glaxo's patents on the grounds that the
version of Zantac marketed by the British company, known as Form Two and
whose patents expire in 2002, was no different from another version, Form
One, which has never been marketed but whose patents expire in December
1995.
The victory comes as a significant relief for Glaxo. Had Novopharm won, it
would have been able to market generic versions of Form Two Zantac from
January 1996. Sales of drugs whose patents expired recently have halved
within 12 months.
Novopharm was unavailable for comment last night. Normally, such cases go to
appeal.
Worldwide sales of Zantac increased 11 per cent in the last financial year.
Sales in the US rose 13 per cent.
Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive, said Zantac's performance was
remarkable. However, this month he warned that there remained other threats
to the Zantac franchise besides the Novopharm challenge:
The expiry next year of the US patents of Zantac's main competitor,
SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Zantac will have to compete with cheap generic
versions of that drug.
Generic versions of Form One Zantac after its patents expire at the end of
1994.
New-generation drugs, such as Astra's Losec.
However, in spite of those threats, Dr Sykes insisted, Zantac's franchise
had a positive future.

FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Paramount shares soar on reports
of rival bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Paramount Communications, which agreed to be acquired by Viacom
for Dollars 8.2bn last Sunday, rose sharply yesterday afternoon on reports
that Mr Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System, is considering a
rival bid for the group.
News agency reports said a board meeting of Turner Broadcasting had given Mr
Turner the green light to explore a rival offer for Paramount, best known
for Hollywood's Paramount Pictures film studios.
Shares in Paramount closed at Dollars 68 3/8 , up Dollars 3 5/8 , on the New
York Stock Exchange.
No comment was immediately available from Turner Broadcasting, but Mr Turner
is believed to have held informal talks with Paramount about a possible
link-up earlier this year.
Turner Broadcasting, best known for its CNN 24-hour news channel, recently
agreed to pay Dollars 600m to acquire two of Hollywood's few remaining
independent film studios, New Line Cinema and Castle Rock Entertainment.
Responding to yesterday's bid reports, a Paramount spokesman said: 'We
repeat what we have said from the first day: the merger with Viacom is a
perfect business fit, and is in the best interests of our shareholders. It
will be completed.'
QVC Network Inc, a fast-expanding home shopping cable business, is also
believed to be weighing a rival bid for Paramount.

An Egyptian student and a cab driver from England were shot yesterday in
separate incidents in Florida, AP reports from Daytona Beach.
Mr Ehab Souka, 24, the student, stopped at a railway crossing when he was
approached by two men who attempted to get into his car.
He saw a flash and felt a sharp pain to his left temple. Mr Souka was able
to drive himself to hospital.
The cab driver, Christopher Bartley, 28, was called to a Daytona Beach motel
to pick up two men. He drove them to their destination where, neither having
said anything, one shot him in the face, police said.
He jumped out of his cab and ran away, then returned to the car and found
the men had gone. Mr Bartley managed to drive back to base and call an
ambulance.
Both victims were in a stable condition in hospital last night.

MR Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State is expected to announce on

reports from Washington.
The White House has underscored its effort to follow up on the accord
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation that was signed on
Monday in Washington.
Mr Christopher has agreed to spearhead the effort to raise money to make the
peace plan work by developing the impoverished Gaza and West Bank areas
where Palestinians are to gain self-rule. Some have estimated it would cost
Dollars 3bn. US officials have refused to disclose details of the
conference.
Israel and the Vatican are on the verge of establishing full diplomatic
relations as a result of Israel's recognition of the PLO, the World Jewish
Congress said yesterday. It said the two had made good progress and could
establish relations 'within weeks.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday told Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime
minister, that the US would like to see a political initiative to stop the
violence in Somalia, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Clinton was speaking at a photo-session in the US capital with Mr Ciampi,
who has voiced concern that the UN mission in Somalia should not turn into a
'police operation'.
Italy, a former colonial power in Somalia, believes the US and the UN have
turned a peacekeeping mission into a military campaign aimed at capturing
warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed.
Mr Clinton was asked about a letter sent by Gen Aideed to the UN asking for
an independent commission to evaluate criminal charges against him and
pledging to abide by the results. 'My main concern is not to allow Somalia
to deteriorate into the conditions in which it was in before the UN went
there,' Mr Clinton replied.
'Obviously we would like it if some political initiative could be taken to
stop the current violence, but we cannot afford to do anything that would
permit the country, after all the efforts the UN has made, to deteriorate to
its former conditions where thousands of people are killed or starve at
random.'
Mr Clinton said US officials were 'looking at our options' in Somalia but
had made no decisions.
Italy has about 2,400 soldiers in Somalia, but because of disagreement with
the US over how the UN mission is run, it plans to move them out of
Mogadishu to a post north of the capital.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (21): Be wary of taxes and
lawyers - Property abroad / In Europe, the purchase price is only the
beginning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S SINGLE market is now in place, but it has not yet made the purchase
of residential property across borders much easier. Buying a house in
another EC country can be as fraught with complications, unexpected costs
and differing legislation as it would be further afield.
Most buyers of second homes abroad are smitten with a place or a particular
property while they are on holiday, and many are tempted to hand over their
money there and then. This is when the unprepared start tumbling into the
numerous pitfalls lurking in unfamiliar property markets. Advice is
essential.
The Federation of Overseas Property Developers, Agents and Consultants* has
fact-sheets on the legal aspects of buying property in Spain, France,
Portugal and Switzerland. Guides for Italy and Malta are in the pipeline.
The fact-sheets give basic advice on how the process works and the main
pitfalls, and also an indication of the cost components; but the federation
strongly recommends prospective buyers to instruct a local lawyer to guide
them through the transaction. It can refer buyers to a suitable lawyer in
most countries.
The price-tag on a property is not the only factor to take into account.
Taxes, lawyers' fees and other costs involved in the house-buying process
can add considerably more to the price than in the UK. In some countries, it
is customary for the purchaser, rather than the vendor, to pay any estate
agent's commission, though this may be included in the price quoted.
The Woolwich building society, which also has a European operation, earlier
this year carried out a survey of house purchase costs in Europe, and found
that Britain was the cheapest place in which to buy. Additional costs put
only 2 per cent on to the purchase price, on average, while in Spain and
Portugal the extras pushed up the total by more than 10 per cent.
Spain still accounts for by far the largest proportion of UK-owned
residential property overseas, though France, the US, Portugal and Italy are
also very popular.
A new tax regime, intended to combat widespread tax evasion, is raising
protests from foreign owners of property in Spain. The law means that, even
if you do not let your Spanish property, you are liable for tax on deemed
income from letting, calculated on a percentage of the house's value. This
applies even if the property sits empty all year.
Another problem in Spain, as well as other places, is that debts can be
attached to a property rather than its owner. New owners can be presented
with bills for back taxes, or threatened with repossession if the previous
owner did not clear a mortgage on the property. It is absolutely essential
to get your lawyer to check that the house is free of charges.
What would happen if you died may not be the first thing on your mind when
you are buying a holiday home abroad, but arrangements made at the start can
avoid later inheritance problems. Unlike British law, where a Will is
binding when it comes to the disposal of property after death, laws in some
other countries lay down that your children are each entitled to a share of
the property, no matter what your Will says. France is where most British
buyers experience this problem. There can be ways round these laws, such as
owning the property through a company, but this needs forward planning, and
may be best done at the time the property is bought.
Double-taxation treaties between the UK and other countries should usually
mean that you will be able to offset any income tax, capital gains and
inheritance tax you have to pay in the country where you have your second
home against your UK tax liabilities. However, there are exceptions; so seek
advice from the Inland Revenue or an accountant if you are unsure.
The property markets in most EC countries are now relatively free of
restrictions for EC buyers; Denmark is one exception, effectively banning
the sale of holiday homes to non-Danes without a residence permit.
Elsewhere, however, there can be severe constraints on who can buy what, and
where.
Switzerland imposes a number of restrictions on outside buyers, including
annual quotas for foreign purchases in each canton. This year, non-Swiss
buyers will be allowed to buy about 1,420 properties, but owning a home
there does not entitle you to residency. Foreign purchasers or their
immediate families must occupy the property for a minimum of three to six
weeks a year, and there may be a maximum number of weeks it can be let each
year. The property cannot be resold within two years, except in extreme
circumstances, and there is no guarantee that it can be sold to another
non-Swiss.
Jersey is for the really seriously rich: strict regulations mean no one with
an income of less than about Pounds 500,000 a year need apply to buy a
house. Permission must be sought from the island's housing committee, which
allows five to 10 people to take up residence every year, on the basis of
the social or economic contribution they can make to the island's welfare.
With income tax at 20 per cent, the minimum expected tax contribution is
Pounds 100,000 a year. The not-so-wealthy but famous also stand a chance, if
it is considered their image would be good for Jersey.
Guernsey is less limited, but is still a place where money talks. Most
dwellings on the island cannot be bought by outside purchasers, but about 10
per cent are available on the open market. Open-market properties start at
about Pounds 200,000, and go up to well over Pounds 1m. Income tax in
Guernsey is 20 per cent, and there is no capital gains tax.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Private View: The king's holiday of a lifetime - The exiled
monarch of Greece caused uproar by taking his family there this summer. Does
King Constantine want his throne back?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO, I said, did you enjoy your holiday? The question was not innocent,
especially not on the day the Greek government collapsed.
The former king of Greece smiled blandly. 'I did indeed. Absolutely. It was
a great holiday - all the family together on this small boat going round our
country, which was a wonderful feeling.'
Was it not spoilt by the crowds, the television cameras, the warships and
aircraft following you?
'The shouting of the crowds was wonderful, the warships I could have done
without. There were certain moments of tension, but a lot of relaxation, and
swimming and running around with the little children.
'No, we had a good time,' he added. 'It was just some elements in the Greek
hierarchy got the wrong impression. I think they assumed a lot and
over-reacted on that assumption, and therefore the trouble started.'
The man who styles himself His Majesty King Constantine, former King of the
Hellenes, but whose enemies call 'Mr. Constantine Glucksburg', enraged
republicans by taking his wife Anne-Marie and five children on a tour of his
homeland last month, the first since he fled into exile 26 years ago.
On his return to London, where he lives, the ex-king conducted a round of
interviews arranged by his public relations courtiers. I was ushered into
his Mayfair office for an audience which included his elder daughter Alexia
and second son Nikolaos.
'I don't understand why they had to over-react,' Constantine innocently
continued, though conceding that the nightly display of popular enthusiasm
on sympathetic TV channels might have had something to do with it.
Wasn't it naive of you not to anticipate the fuss, I asked? It's not as if
you went incognito, slipping ashore at night for an ouzo in the local cafe.
'Thank God nobody yet has accused me of being naive.'
Did you not foresee how politically sensitive your holiday would be?
He paused. 'I anticipated that there would be quite a considerable amount of
support, quite an amount of indifference and quite an amount of hostility.
'I didn't actually know how people would react. I really didn't'
You guessed that Karamanlis would throw a wobbly, didn't you? (Karamanlis,
the 86-year-old Greek president, organised the 1974 referendum which
abolished the monarchy and threatened this summer to resign if the royal
party were not kept under surveillance).
'It's not a concern of mine because I'm a private citizen and I'm entitled
to do what I want. If he wants to have a wobbly . . . well, he can go and
wobble.
'Don't forget that for 18 years since the Republic was proclaimed I have
deliberately kept away because I didn't want anybody to accuse me of
interfering.
'Eighteen years is a long time for the Republic to get on with its act. It
should be strong enough to cope with a private citizen going back.'
He did not add that until he sorted out his tax dispute with the government
last year, a visit could have been risky.
'The other consideration I had was my children. My children are Greeks,
educated as Greeks. We speak Greek to each other. They speak Greek to each
other. It's their homeland. They want to start going back. I thought the
time had come . . . '
Why go back with such a fanfare?
'It wasn't a fanfare. That was created by the authorities at home once I got
there. They could have easily, simply, ignored it.'
You could have gone on a package holiday to Corfu . . .
'There would be a fanfare. The moment I set foot . . . '
Nobody would know who you were.
'You bet your life they would] The moment I come out into the streets the
whole of Corfu would come out.'
What conclusion did you draw about the level of your support? (Surveys
suggest it has fallen from 30 per cent in 1974 to 10 per cent today.)
'No conclusions at all. I wouldn't even think about that in terms of
percentages. I was taken aback quite honestly by the fact that wherever we
went we were treated so kindly.'
Given the political instability of the Balkans, do you think kings have a
part to play?
'It could well be. It's very hard to answer that truthfully. I think there
is a very good chance that it could happen. It doesn't necessarily mean that
it will.'
Was your holiday a test? Or was it just a tease?
'It was neither a test nor a tease. If it was a test there would have to be
a hidden agenda. I don't have a hidden agenda.' Constantine lit another
cigarette.
'Nobody in my family, and certainly not I, is going to do anything to try to
overthrow the republic.
'Quite honestly, and quite legitimately, I want to have the rights of every
Greek citizen.'
But have you renounced your ambition to sit on the throne of Greece?
'I have said nothing of the sort. I have simply said that the Greek people
are sovereign. I will do nothing to prejudice their sovereignty. They can do
whatever they like.
'If they were given the opportunity to say 'we want a referendum' and then
'we want the king back', I would do it.'
You'd like to be King of Greece again?
'Absolutely, provided the Greek people wanted it. I would not like to be
King of Greece just for the sake of it. You can only be a sovereign, and
constitutional monarchy can only work, certainly in Europe, if it's by the
free will of the people.'
What conditions would precipitate such a demand?
'I haven't the faintest idea.'
Can you see anything in the present system which leads you to hope?
'I don't see it on the political agenda at the moment at all.'
So you've been a king in waiting all this time, I said, like an actor
waiting for the producer to call?
'I wouldn't describe it like that. I would do that if I didn't have any
other interests in my life. I am a very happy man. I've got a wonderful
family. I've got a lot of interests around the world. I'm not sitting around
for the telephone to ring, under any circumstances.'
When, at the start, I asked him how he liked to be addressed, Constantine
affected not to care. His publicity material speaks differently. I asked him
why he did not drop his title.
'What name shall I take? I mean, I don't have another name.'
Don't you have a family name?
'No, never had one.'
What is your name, then?
'King Constantine.'
So who is this Mr. Glucksburg?
'It's an invention. A total and absolute invention.' Glucksburg, he said,
was merely the German name for the place in Denmark from which his ancestor
King Christian IX had come. 'It's as if you were called Mr Kensington or
something.'
You said you are not just a king in waiting. But what is your job?
'Looking after my family,' Constantine replied. He talked about the
association of Kurt Hahn schools he had founded. (They include Anavryta,
where Constantine was educated, and Gordonstoun, where his cousin the Duke
of Edinburgh was sent).
Have you ever had a job as such?
'No, no, no.'
Have you ever worked for money?
'No.'
There are stories you worked for the Shah of Iran, and that you sold
armoured cars.
'I know, I read all those things, too.'
How do you live?
'With difficulty. But I have to find my way.'
Who pays for this office?
'I find the means of doing it.'
Is it John Latsis? I mentioned the Greek shipowner who has given Pounds 2m
to the British Conservative Party.
'No.'
Or anybody like him?
'I'm not going to get involved in that, I'm sorry. That's my private
business.'
If it became clear that Greece would never want a monarch again, and your
funds ran out, what kind of job would you seek?
'I suspect that I might knock at your door.'
Journalism?
'Yeah.'
Why do you say that?
'I don't know. Just interests me. I used to be quite interested when I was a
kid in the theatre. Used to put up Shakespeare and ancient Greek tragedies.
I loved doing that. So I might go on stage or be a journalist.'
Would you feel it beneath you to ask for a job, having sat on a European
throne?
'No, no, that wouldn't bother me in the least but I'd be amazed if I got the
job. Very difficult to employ a 53-year-old guy.'
He lit another cigarette.
As a former head of state, he said, he could help promote inward investment
and tourism. He talked about re-occupying the family palace at Tatoi, and
opening his remaining acres for public recreation.
'I want people to understand,' he said, dropping the languid manner and
setting his face, 'that I am going to go back now, all the time. There are
people who don't like that. Tough luck. They can't have the luxury of their
Republic as well as me sitting in exile. I've been polite enough for 18
years.
'I can understand that people think there must be a hidden agenda and other
motives. But I tell you that there isn't'

INTERGENERATIONAL tension. It is an unpleasant prospect, and not at all
suitable for contemplation in what has been deemed the European Year of
Older People. But the arguments raised in Britain about the extent to which
pensioners should be protected from rises in value added tax might be
regarded as harbingers of more serious disputes to come.
Years ago, in his Private Eye column, Auberon Waugh used to fantasise about
relieving state pensioners of the weight of their wallets as they staggered
out of the Post Office. Now, one need only consider the growing number of
juveniles apparently reduced to beggary on the streets to imagine how
Waugh's impertinence could be translated into a genuine terror of
anti-geriatric resentment.
Other phenomena attest to a shift in the balance of the generations. Some
are banal: the bumper stickers which proclaim 'I'm Spending My Children's
Inheritance', and the celebrity of TV retirement sit-coms (One Foot in the
Grave, Waiting For God, etc).
More serious indices include the establishment of the 'University of the
Third Age' up and down the country and the success of Richard Ingrams' The
Oldie magazine ('Buy it before you snuff it').
The statistic which underpins these phenomena is that 15 per cent of the
British population is now over 65. The proportion is unlikely to grow much
in the future, but it is a significant departure from the past.
All this makes the campaign of Age Concern ('How Long Before People Call You
Names? Fight Ageism Now') timely, but confusing. To create a class of 'Third
Age' citizens, with its own behavioural attributes and almost tribal
cohesion, is not equivalent to putting a civic premium upon longevity.
Recognising the rights of the old is not the same as honouring their duties,
and to stress the 'normality' of the old is misguided. And for the old to
create hermetic spaces of their own, in which they proceed to ape the young
 -it happens, most notoriously, in Florida - is asking for marginalisation
and ridicule.
The stereotypes on which an entertainment like One Foot in the Grave relies
are, if one thinks about it, spurious. Peevishness is a fault of character,
not of age. But the tendency to sideline the over-60s is enough to turn any
of them into misanthropic ranters. As Cicero argued in his Essay on Old Age,
mental agility has always been more highly valued than physical prowess. So
why should anyone assume that muscular weakness implies failing powers?
What we need is to recover a collective acceptance of the ageing process
which properly salutes those we already term senior citizens. That many old
people in Britain resent that denomination is a mark of communal failure.
Seniority has become conflated with senescence, or even with senility; we
have somehow lost the ancient understanding that an infant is born
'mindless' and is only shaped into a rational being by the passage of years.
A busload of pensioners may not add up to a coterie of philosophers, but the
association of age with wisdom is not dismissable as some outmoded
sentiment. It is the logical consequence of the tradition of empirical
knowledge.
'Ageism', if it implies the perceived redundance of anyone beyond 60 (or 50,
or even 40, as some women are finding), simply runs against the grain of
scientific method.
The latitudes of age are a measure of good sense. This was something that
our ancestors understood, with their essentially presbyterial societies; and
it just survives in our present constitution with that stronghold of sages,
the House of Lords. Ageism is irrational. To the defeat of irrationality,
let us raise our glasses of chronologically challenged claret.

FT  18 SEP 93 / As They Say in Europe: A surfeit of good news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAPERS faced a real problem this week. What could they say about an
amazing event that, by the time it took place, had become a bit of an
anti-climax? And after all it was hard to say anything that added to the
news itself. For me the high point of the ceremonial signing of the Middle
East peace agreement came with the sight of Mrs Al Gore tripping across the
White House lawn on the arms of an airman, a scene surely stolen from that
dreadful, long-forgotten Hollywood musical North Atlantic.
Even though the superfluity of comment has never stopped a leader writer
writing leaders, this week there was clear evidence of comment fatigue. The
Germans showed it most clearly. On Monday the press review of the radio
station, Deutsche Welle, opened with the words: 'The main theme in the
editorials of the German papers today is the outcome of the election for the
Mayor of Munich. In addition there is the long-running discussion over the
successor to President von Weizsacker as well as the signing of partial
autonomy agreement for the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip and Jericho.'
The French, on the other hand, threw themselves into a frantic cliche
competition. Walls of hate, a hundred years of bloodshed, salute the men of
peace, 1989 all over again - it flowed in an endless stream. Eventually
Liberation won the Purple Bore award by opening its commentary with the
words, 'It has been said, it has to be repeated, the agreement signed in
Washington resembles that of 15 years ago which put an end to the war
between Israel and Egypt only in form and in its staging.'
The headlines ranged from 'Peace sealed with a handshake' to 'An end to
bloodshed.' Aftenposten of Oslo was able to write, for the first time quite
legitimately, about 'Norway and the Middle East problem.' The Neue Zurcher
Zeitung, with its usual cheap sensationalism, ran the headline, 'The
Gaza-Jericho Agreement signed' right across two columns.
This paper joined its peers elsewhere in solving the problem of what to
write about when there is one big story and little else. You write about
football. The NZZ examined the crisis in the Scottish game, which might seem
odd until you remember that Scotland's attempt to enter the World Cup final
rounds in the US next year seems to have collapsed. The Scots have been laid
low by the ultimate ignominy - victims of Swiss sporting prowess. Not that
the NZZ actually gloated, it just examined how the Scots felt and what would
happen to the manager, Andy Roxburgh. (He resigned).
The paper's counterpart in Paris, Le Monde, devoted its front page
commentary to the corruption crisis surrounding Olympique Marseille and its
banning from the European Cup following bribery allegations and the curious
behaviour of the team's owner, the millionaire socialist Bernard Tapie. In a
piece headed 'Planet Football,' Le Monde tried to assure its readers that
events surrounding OM and the European authority, UEFA, were worthy of
attention, for they were part of a wider European phenomenon. 'Having
excluded from the competition in the last few weeks, one by one, clubs from
Poland, Georgia and Latvia, UEFA is only spectacularly confirming its policy
of intransigence in a period of transition that sees the burgeoning in
Eastern Europe of young, inexperienced football federations.' In other
words, UEFA is not playing its role in the European process.
The last of the big three, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung devoted its
main editorial last weekend to the prosperity of the German league, the
Bundesliga. 'Bad times are good for football. Thus many analysts see the
boom in the Bundesliga. Things are not so bad in Germany, with recession and
structural change, that everyday cares have stopped fans going in their
droves to football matches.' Only in the old eastern states, said the paper,
did football fail to flourish.
So it emerges that football is a symbol of national political failure - 'The
Bundesliga has again become what it was before unification - a purely west
German quality sports product.'
Thus these top papers confronted a familiar marketing problem - how to
achieve product differentiation when the product is the result of external
forces which are the same for everybody. Curiously El Pais in Spain failed
to adopt the football solution. Regularly last week, on page seven, a full
page contained a picture of the lower part of a male torso, fully clad. The
caption read, 'His testicles will appear in El Pais.' Turn over to page nine
and a photo of a clearly defined upper torso of a woman appears. Its caption
is, 'Her breasts will appear in El Pais.' Page 11 was an advertisement for
the 'El Pais Visual Encyclopaedia of Living Beings.' A Spanish colleague
blamed this on the coarse Benetton ads featuring sick people and suchlike,
but I think it was there to distract attention from all the good news.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (20): Tiny twins turn
their attention to Europe - Profile, The Channel Islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS RECENTLY as 30 years ago, the Channel Islands scarcely had an offshore
financial industry worthy of the name. Now, however, Jersey and Guernsey
together boast bank deposits of over Pounds 85bn and offshore investment
funds worth not far short of Pounds 30bn.
To put this into perspective, the two tiny islands - Jersey has a population
of rather more than 80,000, Guernsey of about 60,000 - have attained a size
statistically equivalent to between a fifth and a quarter of the banking and
investment funds industries on the UK mainland.
This is, of course, rather deceptive. These offshore centres are basically
booking and processing centres, and almost all of the money is actually sent
on to the UK or elsewhere for investment. And while Jersey and Guernsey are
big in these particular sectors, they are very small in life assurance and
pensions, because these kinds of investment lack the tax incentives that
have driven their growth on the mainland.
Guernsey and Jersey have also long been prominent in the area of offshore
trusts, a standard means by which wealthy people can hold assets out of
reach of mainland tax men. Another important service is offshore company
registration, sometimes for big multinational parent groups, but more
usually for family businesses or for the purpose of individual tax planning.
The relatively high costs of the Channel Islands mean that they find little
attraction in seeking low-value business from the mainland, although several
UK building societies market offshore deposit accounts from Jersey and
Guernsey. For a better choice of building societies, and a selection of
offshore life companies, try the Isle of Man, or Dublin.
In the past the staple business of Jersey and Guernsey has been providing
investment services to UK expatriates dotted around the world, who find it
convenient and safe to hold their investments in the tax-free Channel
Islands. More recently, however, the islands have been developing the
concept of 'offshore Europe', in order to attract custom from the European
Community, outside which they lie for the purposes of financial services.
Guernsey, in particular, has been forging interesting connections with
various Swiss banks which have found it less and less profitable to handle
private banking business within their own borders, mainly for tax reasons.
Geographically, the Channel Islands are reasonably well-positioned, within a
short plane ride of London, Paris, Zurich and other European centres, and in
this respect they score over centres such as Bermuda and Cayman. In terms of
type of business, they have positioned themselves in the middle of the
market, seeking business from the moderately wealthy - although the
super-rich probably still get a better service in Switzerland.
Quality of service can still be a problem. Labour shortages have been eased
by the recent recession, but investors who use offshore centres have to
balance the tax advantages with the frustrations and hassle of dealing with
faraway bank officials.
It is not easy to run substantial financial industries out there in amongst
the ocean waves, but Jersey and Guernsey manage the trick better than most
of their rivals.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (19): Homecomings call for
careful planning - Expatriates and offshore investment / Donald Elkin
examines the tax position of Britons who, through choice or circumstances,
live abroad, and of those who eventually decide to return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO PERVASIVE is the UK tax system that few of the estimated 2m Britons who
live and work overseas manage to escape its clutches completely.
Permanent residents of the UK pay tax on a worldwide basis, ie on income,
realised capital gains and, when they die, assets too. However, becoming not
resident and not ordinarily resident eliminates the income tax charge on all
overseas income and some UK sources, too, together with all capital gains -
except those arising from assets used in a UK business.
Ceasing to be domiciled in any of the countries which make up the UK reduces
the inheritance tax charge to UK assets only. Of course, these reductions in
UK liability may be achieved only at a cost of paying tax in your host
country.
Most working expatriates acquire non-residence by being absent on employment
for a minimum of a full tax year (April 6 to April 5), and by ensuring that
intervening UK visits exceed neither six months in any tax year nor three
months a year on average. By contrast, nothing less than permanent
emigration will enable you to replace your UK domicile with a domicile of
choice in your new country of residence.
As will be seen, provided you eschew all UK taxable investments, becoming
non-resident will enable you to ignore UK tax factors when making investment
decisions - until resumption of UK residence is once again in prospect.
Then, it is clearly desirable to plan ahead, not only to avoid untoward
results, but also to achieve the optimum tax position available.
Resumption of permanent residence in the UK will, in the normal course of
events, reinstate worldwide liability. Whilst you have every right to
attempt to modify this by the arrangements you make, remember that in doing
so, you may be swimming against the legislative tide. Consequently, the
Inland Revenue will not disregard any flaws which your plans may contain.
Some planning - for example, for pension provision - needs to be effected at
very long range; say, 10 years or more before return to the UK. Since
non-residents are not permitted to effect UK personal pension plans, various
insurance-based schemes are available, using the concept that the proceeds
of a qualifying policy (minimum term 10 years) are tax-exempt even in the
hands of a UK resident. By means of a fragmented policy structure, such
maturity proceeds can be used as a pension.
For those who, at the time the benefits are drawn, are liable to higher-rate
tax, the advantages can be considerable, since the tax paid by the life
companies on their income and gains is at a rate equivalent to the basic
rate. However, this fact usually makes the oft-claimed tax advantages
illusory as far as basic-rate taxpayers are concerned.
Short-range planning is frequently concerned to ensure that the period of
transition to the UK does not produce unnecessary disadvantages.
Typically, though, the actual date of arrival in Britain is not critical. Or
put another way, the cost of delaying that arrival beyond what would
otherwise be the most suitable date, usually outweighs the tax which can be
saved. However, particular circumstances can be otherwise; for example, if a
large payment of investment income or a large capital gain will arise
shortly after your chosen date of entry into the UK.
Frequently, tax can be avoided by provoking the realisation of accrued
capital gains before UK residence is resumed, using the well known 'bed and
breakfast' procedure. Somewhat similarly, tax on income from overseas
deposit accounts etc. can be minimised by closing them immediately before
you return to the UK.
By contrast, holding assets in offshore trusts can produce much longer
lasting and highly beneficial results, although great care is necessary. A
poorly drawn trust can give rise to endless problems.
Undoubtedly, the greatest potential benefit is achievable by returnees who
are not domiciled in the UK. For them, offshore discretionary trusts have
the capacity to produce total exemption from inheritance tax in relation to
all assets held within them - even if the individual himself subsequently
becomes a UK domiciliary.
Capital gains tax advantages can be achieved by overseas and UK
domiciliaries alike, particularly if action is taken in a tax year before UK
residence is resumed.
Neither offshore single-premium bonds nor offshore 'roll-up' funds give rise
to a taxable event until benefits are drawn - and in the former case until
they exceed 5 per cent a year. Consequently, such investments can be an
important means of deferring tax. Indeed, by delaying drawings until your
marginal tax rate has declined or your liability has ceased, perhaps as a
result of retirement or resumption of non-residence, tax can be permanently
avoided.
But what if your return is sudden and unexpected, so that you have no time
for forward planning? Even then, all is not lost. Dividing assets between
you and your spouse, and making use of the government approved tax-exempt
schemes (Peps, Tessas and National Savings certificates) can produce a very
satisfactory income tax position, although, depending on the figures, more
action may be appropriate on the inheritance tax front.
Suppose you return from overseas with Pounds 1m to invest, having already
purchased a house valued at Pounds 500,000. If the capital is divided
equally between you and your spouse and is invested as follows:
Pounds                                  Income
104,000 cash                             6,240
46,000 Peps/Tessas/NS certificates      (2,250)
425,000 fixed-interest investments      27,625
425,000 equities                        14,875
1,000,000                     Taxable   48,740
                              Exempt     2,250
the resulting tax position will be:
1. Income tax: Pounds 9,782 a year at a top rate of 25 per cent and an
average rate of 19.18 per cent.
2. Capital gains tax: exemptions. Inflation plus Pounds 5,800 a year (each).
First Pounds 3,635 of gains (each) charged at 25 per cent. Excess at 40 per
cent.
3. Inheritance tax: if the first to die leaves assets of Pounds 150,000 to
the children and the balance to the surviving partner, no tax will be
payable at that time. Liability on the second death: Pounds 480,000 at a
marginal rate of 40 per cent and an average rate of 35.55 per cent.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (18): Claim regularly,
wherever you may be - Medical insurance / Some policies now cover GP visits,
dental treatment and spectacles, as well as childbirth and physiotherapy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET for private medical insurance has expanded rapidly in recent
years. Policies now on offer range from the most basic, which will cover
in-patient treatment if the National Health Service waiting list is longer
than six weeks, to those covering every aspect of private healthcare.
The choice to be made is between cost and convenience. New policies emerging
at the top end of the market are aimed at busy people who need to have
medical treatment when and where it suits them, rather than at the health
system's convenience, or at a shortlist of hospitals where the insurance
company has arranged the best deals.
They may also want to be covered for more primary medical care in the
private sector, and also dental care, as more dentists opt out of treating
patients on the NHS. Privacy and punctuality are a consideration for many
people, who do not want to spend time in crowded waiting rooms.
The most comprehensive insurance policies now cover private GP visits,
routine dental treatment, even spectacles and contact lenses in some cases,
as well as complementary medicine, physiotherapy and normal childbirth.
Unlike traditional medical insurance, these policies are designed to enable
you to make regular claims. They are also likely to cover treatment during
travel outside the UK.
There are still a few exclusions, commonly HIV and Aids, self-inflicted
injuries, alcoholism, war injuries and cosmetic surgery.
Obviously, policies as comprehensive as these do not come cheap. Jan Lawson,
of Private Health Partnership, the specialist intermediary, says
top-of-the-range comprehensive policies are likely to cost 60-70 per cent
more for any given individual than a standard policy.
The Clinicare Carte Blanche plan, from Medical Insurance Agency, has set out
to be the most comprehensive policy on the market. It covers the full list
of GP consultations, prescriptions, dental treatment, spectacles and contact
lenses, maternity and complementary therapy, as well as all the usual
hospital benefits and specialist consultations. There are cash limits on
some of the benefits, for example Pounds 1,000 for dental treatment.
The other big selling point for Carte Blanche is that it can cover some
existing conditions, for an extra premium determined by the company's
underwriters. Other insurers either refuse cover altogether to people with
existing medical problems, or exclude treatment for that condition
permanently or for a period of years. Clinicare will provide cover for most
conditions from day one.
The policy also includes travel insurance for holiday or business trips of
up to 30 days, excluding winter sports, but it is not available for anyone
living or working outside the UK.
Cover for a single person in good health, aged 30, would cost Pounds 68.13 a
month, while a married 40-year-old with two or more children under 18 would
pay Pounds 221.60 a month. The maximum age at entry is 64, at which a
married couple with no problematic medical conditions would pay Pounds
288.06 a month. Annual premiums work out slightly cheaper.
Norwich Union's most comprehensive policy is its Premier Care plan. This
covers GP consultations, prescriptions, and routine dentistry; pregnancy,
psychiatry and rehabilitation are covered after two years, as is limited
infertility treatment, which is excluded by the Clinicare policy. Existing
conditions are excluded, but there are no upper age limits on joining. There
is Pounds 50,000 of cover for emergency medical treatment on overseas trips
of up to 90 days.
With the Norwich scheme, a married man aged 40 with two children would pay
Pounds 285.20 a month. There is a 5 per cent discount if premiums are paid
annually by direct debit.
WPA's Oak scheme is its most comprehensive, but it does not cover quite the
same range of services. It excludes GPs' bills, and private childbirth, and
only pays for an annual dental and optical check-up, not for any treatment
or spectacles. However, it does cover a limited amount of treatment by
chiropodists, osteopaths and chiropractors. Overseas travel is covered for
up to 60 days a year. A married 40 year-old with a family, living in London,
would pay Pounds 158.60 a month for Oak cover.
ate policy covers a similar list of treatments, except that it will pay for
childbirth if the mother has been a subscriber to the scheme for 10 months
or more. Worldwide cover excluding the USA and Canada for a 40-year-old plus
spouse and family would cost Pounds 173.40 a month.
Older people have particular problems in finding appropriate medical
insurance. Some insurers have quite high age limits at entry, or none at
all, but the big problem is the exclusion of existing conditions. The older
you are when cover commences, the less likely it is that you will have a
completely clean bill of health. For similar reasons, changing insurers late
in life can also be problematic. Some insurers have specialist policies for
the over-60s.
Tax relief is available on private medical insurance for UK residents over
60, but on condition that most of the insured benefits are in the UK. So if
you spend part of the year somewhere sunnier, you could lose out. One
solution, used by Jan Lawson, is to arrange long term travel insurance with
comprehensive medical benefits in addition to a UK medical insurance policy.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: The Bolshoy at its best - Andrew Clark admires the
company's performance in Lucerne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIANT tone, powerful voices, larger-than-life performances: that sums up the
Bolshoy Opera, whose visit to Lucerne this month was the undisputed high
point of the festival. It was an extraordinary meeting of opposites - the
extravagant Bolshoy style and the undemonstrative orderliness of this neat
Swiss city. Even without the visual enhancement of staged productions, the
Bolshoy concerts were full of drama and roof-raising sound, more attuned to
the company's big Moscow home than Lucerne's modest Kunsthaus. Here was a
different tradition - not just well-preserved, but bristling with vitality
and excitement.
Since the Gorbachev reforms, the Bolshoy has been overshadowed in western
eyes by the Kirov, thanks to the St Petersburg company's growing links with
Britain's Royal Opera, its recent recordings and the independent reputation
established by its artists. The Bolshoy has always seemed the more
monolithic institution, known less for personalities than politics and
spectacle. It made its British debut in Glasgow and Edinburgh three years
ago, but the visit was dogged by technical problems. Lacking a big theatre,
Lucerne dispensed with the old-fashioned splendour of the Bolshoy's
stagings, and made do with concert performances of Rakhmaninov's Aleko,
Tchaikovsky's Iolanta and Yevgeny Onegin.
What impressed was not so much the quality of individual singers or
instrumental sections, but the overall excellence. These were company
performances through-and-through, conducted with no-nonsense authority and
balletic energy by the Bolshoy's music director, Alexander Lazarev. The
sheer unanimity of ensemble and size of tone were breathtaking.
Equally striking was the arrival of a new, younger generation of solo
singers: no ageing, spreading sopranos or wobbly basses here. The singers
looked their parts, Pavel Chernykh's handsome Onegin as much as Vladimir
Matorin's formidably bearded gypsy father in Aleko. They also coloured and
projected the words as only Russians can in their native tongue, blending
their voices and reactions in the manner of a seasoned ensemble. And these
were without exception big voices, part of an historic national tradition,
selected for their ability to penetrate the furthest corners of the Bolshoy
Theatre. Nowhere else will you find voices of such amplitude today.
Pride of place went to Maria Gavrilova, the unflamboyant Semfira in Aleko
and dignified Tatyana in Onegin, a classic Russian lirico-spinto soprano
with bright, forward tone. Her virile tenor partner in Aleko was Oleg Kulko;
in Onegin the sweet-voiced Lensky was Arkady Mishenkin. All the leading
baritones, including Nicolai Reshelniak's Aleko, sang with more thrust than
warmth; Yuri Vedenyev had the best opportunity of all in the Duke of
Burgundy's aria in Iolanta, bringing out its dramatic fervour without a
trace of self-indulgence. Irina Bikulova may have lacked the ideal vocal
purity for the blind princess Iolanta, but her duet with Vladimir Bogachev's
impassioned Vaudemont was suitably open-hearted: these Russian singers are
not afraid to express strong emotions. And among the excellent comprimarios,
there was a golden-haired, golden-voiced young bass, Maxim Mikhailov, who is
clearly destined for greater things.
Aleko, a one-act graduation piece drawn from a narrative poem by Pushkin and
premiered at the Bolshoy in 1893, benefited least from the concert setting:
its episodic musical character really needs the stage colour of the gypsy
setting, and it proved a pale companion-piece for Rakhmaninov's Second
Symphony. Iolanta, Tchaikovsky's last, shortest and most benign opera,
offered less scope for the imagination than Onegin, in which the musical
drama easily compensated for the concert setting. The spontaneous standing
ovation which the normally sedate Lucerne audience accorded the Onegin cast
was fully deserved.
Change has come slowly and steadily to the Bolshoy since the fall of
communism. The ease with which talented younger singers can rise to the top
is one of the more obvious developments. Another is the drop in political
interference. According to Vitaly Fomin, the company's commercial director,
the Bolshoy is now self-governing and receives its state subsidy direct from
the Ministry of Finance, amounting to 70 per cent of the budget. Another
five per cent comes from private sponsors - wealthy Russian individuals who
have revived the pre-1917 tradition of supporting the arts without expecting
something in return.
The Bolshoy is also learning to sell itself in the market place. It has
signed a deal with Britain's National Video Corporation for films of The
Maid of Orleans, A Life for the Tsar and Mlada. It has entered a
co-production arrangement with Genoa for Prince Igor, one of two new opera
stagings to be shown in Moscow in the coming season (the other is May
Night). The touring schedule has increased: the Bolshoy Ballet is currently
in Japan; and the orchestra - which has already toured Germany and
Switzerland this year, visits Britain this month and the US in October and
November.
But old habits die hard. The payroll is as big as ever: the Bolshoy still
has well over 2500 employees, including a social welfare programme that
embraces a kindergarten, hospital and Black Sea health resort. The number of
performing artists alone runs to 1000, including more than 70 principal
singers. All are salaried staff. Although soloists are given leave for guest
contracts in the West, no-one has left the company since the fall of
communism - in striking comparison to the Kirov. Such is the proud sense of
company identity.
The downside is that singers feel no obligation to give a minimum number of
performances. 'We hope to settle this problem in the coming season, so that
artists know their repertoire-plan in advance, and can organise their
foreign work around it' says Fomin. 'But we have no intention of reducing
the number of staff. We don't have unnecessary fat, and we appreciate the
work of each person in the theatre. This is their home.'
The Bolshoy Orchestra, conducted by Alexander Lazarev, plays in 14 British
cities over the coming month, including Glasgow tonight, Birmingham (Sept
21/22), London's Barbican Centre (27) and Cardiff (Sept 30 and Oct 4). It
also tours the US from Oct 23 to Nov 17.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Fame: more precious than money - The semi-finalists in
the Leeds piano competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGHT AFTER night, Leeds has been playing host to a grand pub-pianist
contest. I was truly sorry to miss it - but unfortunately it coincided with
the 11th Harveys Leeds International Pianoforte Competition (classical), and
that had a prior claim.
From Monday to Wednesday last, its 12 semi-finalists - survivors from the
original 76 contestants - played their make-or-break solo recitals. Last
night and tonight the six lucky finalists are delivering their chosen
concerti on BBC television, with Simon Rattle and his City of Birmingham
Symphony.
Why do up-and-coming young pros (for Leeds, they must be under 30) put
themselves through such a stressful, possibly excruciating, even humiliating
experience?
Simply for the chance of being noticed. In a musical world over-populated by
pianists, it is a rare debutant who can get public notice in a major
capital. The Leeds contest ensures an invaluable string of engagements for
its winners, more precious than the generous money-prizes (now bigger than
ever). And if these international competitions are to matter so much, better
that there should be lots of them: even the most distinguished juries are
fallible, and performers have their unlucky off-days.
Among the semi-finalists Francois-Frederic Guy (24, already a member of
Boulez's Ensemble InterContemporain) must have had an off-day. His Mozart
sonata, K570 in B-flat, had no detectable spark of life, nor was there the
least hint of a visionary thrill in his Skryabin 5th. Unluckier still, he
offered his tame, underpowered Brahms no. 3 the day after the 29-year-old
American Mark Anderson had delivered that declamatory sonata with
barnstorming assurance (young Brahms himself was a famously hefty performer)
and in magnificent orchestral colours, from crystalline trickles to barking
trombones.
Anderson also gave us a superb Bartok Improvisations, their pawky springs
and hesitations sounding so spontaneous that listeners may have thought them
his own ideas. And though we had admired Filippo Gamba's Debussy that
afternoon, in 'Les fees sont d'exquises danseuses', Debussy's fairies
(inspired by Barrie's Peter Pan in the Kensington Gardens]) had not danced
at all; for Anderson they did, airily and eerily. For mature range and
communicative power, nobody else matched him in these semi-finals.
Though the Taiwanese Ya-Fei Chuang (22) was fluently practised in the
'Ondine' and 'Scarbo' of Ravel's Gaspard de la nuit, Schubert's
Sonata-Fantasy and her slower Rakhmaninov pieces were in dire need of some
ongoing impulse. Elisso Bolkvadze (26, from Georgia) and the Russian
Margarita Shevchenko (25) both played Gaspard complete. Some compromises
were needed to accommodate Miss Bolkvadze's small hands in the big
chord-stretches of 'Le Gibet', but her faultless old-school technique was
masterly in Chopin's Andante pianato &amp; Grand Polonaise, and Prokofiev's 2nd
Sonata. Despite the town hall's swimming-bath acoustics, her tempo for
Liszt's 'Feux Follets' was breathtaking.
In elegant pink pyjamas and a cascade of red-gold hair with a bow,
Shevchenko lived up to her image. Her fleet fingers were as soignee as the
soft, winsome curves of her lyrical line, alike in Schubert's late B-flat
Impromptu (the 'Rosamunde' one) and Rakhmaninov, and the 4th Chopin Scherzo
and Gaspard. The distinct climates of those pieces melted together under her
all-purpose charm.
Contrariwise, her compatriot Katia Skanavi (21) - lean and sulky in black
jacket, leggings and spiky lovelocks, as near punk as you can get without
actually safety-pinning your ears - stormed bitterly through Schubert's A
minor Sonata D784, and crowned her sulphurous reading of Schumann's
Kreisleriana with an epilogue of dry, unwinking, baleful precision.
Extraordinary performances, potently original. By comparison the resonant,
well-planned, extrovert accounts of Chopin's 24 Preludes and Rakhmaninov's
2nd Sonata that we heard from Maxim Philippov (also 21) sounded reassuringly
familiar. But his Ravel 'Alborada' was terrific: miles away from Lipatti's
legendary poise, and that much nearer to the controlled detonations that
Ravel composed.
The six finalists are: Mark Anderson, Riccardo Castro, Filippo Gamba, Leon
McCawley, Maxim Philippov and Margarita Shevchenko.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: A dramatic souffle - Alastair Macaulay is captivated
by Tom Stoppard's 'Travesties'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UPROARIOUS, virtuoso, heartless, Tom Stoppard's Travesties returns to the
Royal Shakespeare Company only nine months before its 20th birthday.
Brilliantly it combines its contrasting ingredients: it is a pyrotechnic
absurdist souffle about an overlap of art, aesthetics, and politics; it is a
bitter little joke about the derangements of memory; and it is a postmodern
mix of song-and-dance, history, dialectic, farce, time-travelling,
striptease, and Oscar Wilde pastiche. Following it closely, one clings on
giddily, recklessly, helplessly. But this is delight at the expense of
sympathy. Stand back, and it becomes easy to resent the play's darling
cleverness.
Travesties, you may recall, covers that time in 1916/17 when Lenin (at the
point of departing for the Finland Station), Tristan Tzara (at the moment of
proclaiming Dadaism), and James Joyce (in the thick of writing Ulysses) all
lived in Zurich. The play sees them through the eyes of Henry Carr, a
British consular official who was preoccupied by playing (for Joyce)
Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest. Carr was a callow young dandy
then, but is old and doddery now. He is the play's protagonist; and it
covers his hopeless efforts, then and now, to cope with these three
historical figures.
The intricacy of Stoppard's invention is astonishing. Likewise his
irrepressible comic flair. There are new touches in Act Two, where Lenin
(Carr's Lenin), in full rhetorical flood, now proclaims 'To lose one
revolution looks like a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness',
and Old Carr comments 'There was nothing wrong with Lenin except his
politics.' The classic jokes - ''tween the before-the-war-to-end-all-wars
years, and the-between-the-wars years', 'When I was at school . . . if you
had a chit from Matron you were let off to spend the afternoon messing about
in the Art Room. Labour or Art. And you've got a chit for life?' - remain.
The sublime centrepiece of this new/old Travesties is Antony Sher as Carr.
Though his is a virtuoso role - now old, now young; a self-preening dandy
lost in the shoelaces of genius; a self-aggrandising dotard dazed in the
pursuit of lost time - the impression Sher himself leaves is of
transparency. He dissolves himself into the part. He places Carr high in the
satirical gallery of silly Englishness. His very vowel sounds recall the
most inspired flights of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Beyond the Fringe,
and subsequent Alan Bennett roles. His Algernon would honour the most
perfect Importance cast. And the way he contrasts the thoughtless energy of
youth with the muddled reflectiveness of age is the only poignant thing
about the play.
Adrian Noble's staging makes the play as lucid as can be. By means of
amplification, musical accompaniment, and dance, it stylishly points out all
the more deranged flights of Carr's reimaginings. David Westhead's natty
Tristan Tzara is a match for Sher; Amanda Harris and Rebecca Saire are
consummately polished as Cecily and Gwendolen; Geoffrey Freshwater and
Darlene Johnson give excellently sober accounts of Lenin and Nadya. The
tense Lloyd Hutchinson, however, lacks authority as James Joyce.
The play requires two sets, the library and Carr's room: which Richard
Hudson has designed in ideal contrast - the library a crazily vermilion
corridor, the room a wide, pale, Dadist arc. I do not adore the cuckoo-clock
that tells us and Carr when his mind is wandering; but, like everything
else, its timing is perfect. In fact, Noble has the play running like a
clock, oiled to perfection.
Travesties reminds me of the German girl working in Foyles's English
Literature department. A customer asked, 'Do you know where I can find Oscar
Wilde?' The girl replied 'I think he's gone for his lunchbreak.' Does it
matter that the play is heartless to the point of being pointless? It
coruscates, exhilarates - and then, with the curtain calls, evaporates.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (17): Helpful variations
on a traditional theme - Life policies / Bethan Hutton discusses products
that can maintain one's living standard, provide assistance in times of
illness and ensure support for dependants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE ASSURANCE's origins as a protective measure can sometimes be forgotten,
now that it is so commonly sold as a savings or investment product.
Its usefulness as protection has not disappeared, but it has been joined by
an array of other products, designed to protect your standard of living and
your dependants against the impact of illness and accidents.
Life, permanent health and critical illness insurance can all have a part to
play in financial planning, particularly for individuals with substantial
income or assets to cover. The first thing to check is what benefits are
provided by any employer's scheme, and work out where they are likely to
fall short. For example, a company's death-in-service benefit may be set at
four times salary, but with the salary capped at Pounds 75,000. For a family
accustomed to an annual income of Pounds 300,000, a one-off payment of this
amount might not be enough.
Arranging Pounds 50,000 of life cover can be as simple as filling in a form
and signing a direct-debit mandate. Unfortunately, arranging Pounds 500,000
of cover can be a rather more complicated process.
Medical underwriting becomes more rigorous the bigger the sum assured gets:
up to Pounds 100,000-Pounds 200,000, companies may be happy to rely on a
report from your own doctor. Above that amount, a medical will become
necessary. These days that will usually include an HIV test and an ECG.
Problems can arise when arranging really large amounts of cover if a single
company is unwilling to shoulder the entire risk, so it has to be split
between several. One company in the group may not be satisfied with the
original medical report, and will insist on a second or even third medical.
For a busy person, this can become too time-consuming.
Peter Smith, a regional director of fee-based advisers Hill Martin, says he
tries to get all the insurers involved to agree in advance to accept a
medical from a Harley Street doctor. This can have the added benefit of
being more convenient for the client, who will not usually be kept waiting
as long as at many GPs' surgeries. The equipment is also likely to be more
sophisticated than the average GP can offer.
Large contracts can require the intermediary to devote a lot of time to
shepherding the application through, and clearing up misunderstandings.
'Unless you can slot into their boxes, you do have to spend a lot of time
talking to them, and talking to the right people. It takes a lot longer to
get cover than it used to,' says Karina Challons, of independent financial
advisers Murray Noble.
She cites the case of one client who was having difficulty getting
acceptance with an insurer. They eventually discovered that the underwriter
was worried about her course of hormone replacement therapy.
Insurers will also ask why you need the cover. They are usually happiest if
it is for standard inheritance tax purposes. If it is for anything else -
for example, shareholder protection - they may demand detailed financial
information. Some would-be insureds are unwilling or slow to provide this
kind of information.
'While there are restrictions and conditions imposed by companies, part of
the difficulty in getting policies on risk for some high net worth
individuals is actually in dealing with those individuals themselves,' says
Mark Bolland, of independent financial advisers Chamberlain De Broe.
He says that one important point to look for, after choosing between
variations on whole-of-life or term assurance, is guaranteed insurability at
a reasonable cost. This means that, if your health deteriorates in the
future, you can be sure of maintaining cover.
For term assurance of less than 10 years, Lloyd's is a possibility - it has
the advantage of flexibility, and Lloyd's underwriters are less afraid of
unusual risks than some life companies, but Smith says premiums are less
competitive than they used to be.
The need for insurance against premature death is accepted almost without
question. However, the chances of dying prematurely are considerably smaller
than the chances of suffering a serious illness which may leave you unable
to work but with large financial commitments.
Permanent health insurance is designed to provide a replacement income if
you are too ill to work for an extended period. If necessary, it can pay out
until retirement. Policies can have different waiting times for payment to
begin, depending on your employer's sick-pay arrangements, if any. It is a
very useful protection product, but benefits are usually limited to about 75
per cent of an individual's salary, less state sickness benefits.
Insurers also impose cash limits on the benefit payable under PHI policies,
even if an individual's salary is very high. The maximum benefit is often
about Pounds 40,000-Pounds 50,000; a handful of companies go further
(Norwich Union's maximum benefit is Pounds 78,000), but it is rarely
possible to replace a six-figure salary under an individual PHI contract.
PHI policies taken out by businesses may be able to provide a higher income,
but for a limited period.
Anyone who either depends on unearned income (which PHI cannot cover) or
wants to top up PHI and life cover could also look at critical illness
insurance. This can sometimes overlap with PHI, but also covers different
circumstances.
Critical illness policies are designed to provide a lump sum if you are
diagnosed as having one of a list of serious illnesses. The main illnesses
covered are heart attacks, strokes and cancer, which account for the
majority of claims, as well as organ transplants, heart surgery and numerous
other conditions. The illnesses do not have to be terminal, or even prevent
you from working. The lump sum can be used for whatever purpose the insured
wishes.
Some critical illness policies automatically include a death benefit; if you
already have adequate life cover, it may be better to choose a stand-alone
policy, which should be cheaper.
Critical illness policies often have clauses including permanent total
disablement and loss of limbs, which are also the main ground covered by
personal accident policies.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: There's a funny thing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BASINGSTOKE, that small southern English town, has suffered at the hands of
dramatists ever since Gilbert &amp; Sullivan. Now it has its revenge with the
splendidly refurbished Haymarket Theatre, entirely reconstructed since June
last year and reopening with The Cheeky Chappie, a play about the comedian
Max Miller.
The theatre itself was on show for the event. The building opened in 1865 as
a Corn Exchange, and then passed through lives as a cinema, roller-skating
rink and fire station.
The 18-month restoration has consolidated and developed existing resources.
The Haymarket now seats 450 in a two-level auditorium, with raked stalls and
a hanging circle built within an iron frame inside the old barrel-vaulted
theatre. The auditorium presses itself on the senses with primary colours,
the foyers are bright and clear, the restaurant in the basement itself a
tricksy stage set. If this seems overdone, it is at least intelligently
overdone and consistently carried through.
Outside, original moldings have been meticulously renovated, and from the
street the theatre looks inviting and easy on the eye.
Architects Renton Howard Wood Levin - theatre credits include the Donmar
Warehouse and the Prince Edward Theatre - should be congratulated on the
Haymarket, as should Basingstoke and Deane borough council and Hampshire
county council which provided Pounds 2.5m and Pounds 640,000 respectively
for the project. The patron, Richard Attenborough, should have better
fortune with this than with his latest  - fictional - charge of Jurassic
Park in Michael Crighton's film.
Now for the show, easy to hear and see because of the inclined auditorium
and apron stage. Adrian Reynolds directs a breezy, undemanding dash through
the life of Thomas Henry Sergeant (1895-1963) who became Max Miller. He was
happily married for 44 years, notwithstanding the appalling jokes about his
wife Kathleen Marsh, but still concealing a 20-year relationship with his
secretary, Ann Graham.
John East's biography, The Cheeky Chappie, has the facts, but Dave Simpson's
1986 play with music conjures a fuller, rounder character out of the
on-stage smut and the off-stage paranoia.
Miller had a laugh like a starter motor and a mind like a sump: 'I went home
the other night, there's a fellow there, not a stitch on. 'Who's this?' I
says to the wife. 'Oh, he's a nudist, and he's come in to use the phone]' -
that's a clever one from the wife, eh?' There is plenty more of this, from
Miller's famous 'Blue Book' of jokes.
The chorus dances and sings a range of music-hall standards, from the
resolutely English of 'Let a smile be your umbrella' and 'If you were the
only girl in the world' to the neatly contrived irony of 'I can't believe
that you're in love with me' sung by Miller's wife (played by Pamela Power)
while Miller and Ann (Helen Fraser) go to bed in the background.
Kenneth Macdonald, who plays Miller, has all his traits and tricks: the foot
on the footlights, the walk developed to avoid creaky planks in seaside
boarding houses late at night, the jaunty shoulders, the high elbows and the
rotating wrists. It is a wonderful characterisation of this teller of puns
and reveller in double entendres.
The Haymarket, Basingstoke (0256 465566) until October 2

FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Berlin courts curators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERLIN IS booming. Germany has the largest domestic market for art and
antiques in the EC. So why is this year's biennial Orangerie art and
antiques fair, the most important in the country, such a perplexing mixture
of the exceptional and the run of the mill?
The Orangerie concept, introduced by the Berlin Association of Art &amp;
Antiques Dealers under the direction of Berndt Schultz in 1982, is to invite
objects rather than than dealers to exhibit. Submitted works of art are
selected, vetted and exhibited chronologically, as if in a museum where
every object is for sale.
Certainly the Orangerie is a place where museum curators like to shop
because the quality as well as authenticity can be tightly controlled. The
silver and parcel gilt Baroque centrepiece by the Augsburg goldsmith
Melchior Gelb I brought by Albrecht Neuhaus of Wurzburg, for instance, would
grace any museum treasury. Indeed its two counterparts are to be found in
the Kunsthistorische Museum in Vienna and the Moscow Armoury.
Other museum-worthy pieces come from Rainer Zietz of London with a massive
Gothic Revival silver presentation cup and stand designed by Schinkel in
1830; Daxel &amp; Marschall of Munich offer a spectacular roll-top desk by the
influential German cabinet-maker David Roentgen; and the 180-piece mid 18th
century Meissen dinner service displayed by Steinbeck of Aachen. Light from
the Orangerie's tall windows plays over its gleaming surfaces.
As in previous years, there is marvellous silver, sculpture, ceramics and
furniture, including a fine group brought over from Paris, but the general
standard of the pictures is lamentable. fair. There is nothing of the
stature of Beckmann's 'Journey on a Fish' which was offered in 1991 for DM
6.9m.
This year's Orangerie is a pre-eminently a Berlin-orientated event. One
reason, no doubt, is that the city's museums now have more money to spend
than any other in Germany. Dealers have also been able to draw on the rich
resources of Berlin's hinterland cut off since Partition. There is a mass of
Berlin porcelain, prospects galore of the city, Berlin iron jewellery, even
a woven silk version of the last will and testament of Frederick Wilhelm
III.
Whatever the quality, the fair, as a result, smacks of provincialism. The
works of art that are not Germanic are French, Flemish or English. (Most of
the red stickers on opening night were to be found on English silver.)
Norbert Pokutta's Canaletto and Sabrina Forster's Castiglione drawing
provide a rare and welcome breath of warm, Southern air.
In transforming the fair into an international event in 1988 the Berlin art
trade took an important step towards re-establishing Berlin's pre-war
position as a major European art market. But if the Orangerie is to vie with
the Paris and London fairs, its organisers, now a limited company, will have
to fight hard to maintain, if not improve, the quality and presentation of
objects to ensure the continued support of the best national and
international dealers.
Orangerie '93 is open daily, 10am-7.30pm, until Sept 26

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Art in the 20th Century is the latest in the Academy's ambitious
series of survey exhibitions, in which the art of a longish lifetime is
being examined, country by country. The modern art of Italy, Germany and
Britain has already been treated, and now it is America's turn to come
before the joint-selectors' eye. For yet again, as with the others, the view
of the subject in both general and particular is that taken by Norman
Rosenthal of the Royal Academy, and Christos Joachimides of the
Zeitgeist-Gesellschaft at Berlin, where the exhibition has already been
shown. Here, then, is no lack of controversy or entertainment. And critical
substance? Well, up to a point, Lord Copper.
The difficulty has been well rehearsed with their previous shows, but
clearly must be set out again. Here is a show that advertises itself as 'a
breathtaking survey' and again 'a monumental survey'. Epithets
notwithstanding, it is no such thing. Some 60 artists in all are shown,
which is not an enormous number, especially given the generous
representation some of them enjoy. Furthermore, 19 of them, something over
30 per cent, are shown in the post-1970 section at the Saatchi Gallery. A
mere 14 take us from 1913 to 1940. The period before 1913 is dismissed
altogether as of no account.
These are disproportionate figures, but only if the claim to being a true
survey is taken seriously. Yet 'survey' it is, which can only invite
expectations bound to be disappointed. What Rosenthal and Joachimides have
given us is their own partial and opinionated selection of the work they
consider relevant and significant within their brief. There is nothing wrong
in that, no matter how wrong-headed and perverse they may be. They should
only declare themselves in their true colours.
As it is, there is nothing for it but to take issue with them. Did modern
art in America really only begin in 1913 with the Armory Show in New York?
In a limited sense perhaps it did, in first bringing the likes of Cezanne,
Van Gogh and Picasso into general public view. But artists themselves, and
indeed the more sophisticated American public, were surely better informed
than that, and certainly no less well-travelled than their European
counterparts. Are we to take it that in the disowning of the Whistlers, the
Sargents and the Prendergasts of the 1900s, for being perhaps too
Europeanised, we may read too the critical dismissal of impressionism and
post-impressionism in their wider aspects? Certainly it would explain the
marked absence of so many of the more figurative artists of the earlier
period - no Sloan, Marsh, Bellowes, Bishop, Nadelman. Edward Hopper must
stand for them all, which is a gross misrepresentation of a vigorous
tradition.
Ah] you might say: but what about the necessity of an essentially American
subject matter, that at least is given here in the works of Georgia O'Keefe
or Charles Sheeler, besides Hopper himself? But what could be more American
than Reginald Marsh's burlesque theatres and strip-joints, or Isobel
Bishop's railway stations, or George Bellowes's fighters? And what is so
especially American about Man Ray, who spent so much time in Europe, or the
Frenchman, Marcel Duchamp, with whom the exhibition begins?
The whole point of American art, of course, is that it is hardly American at
all. It is, rather, but one element in an international, interdependent
picture, viewed only in a particular cultural and historical light. As much
has been true of western art for centuries. It is the old story of
immigrants, expatriates and stay-at-homes, and their coming to terms with
the currency and inheritance - the baggage you might say - of European art.
How fascinating it is to find Marsden Hartley, in such images as his
pre-1914 German Officer, so early and assured in his response to Cubism; and
how strong the proto-Pop paintings and assemblages of the 1920s, of Arthur
Dove and John Covert, Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis, now appear, straight
out of Dada and the early collages of Picasso.
So it is with the next generation of artists, the founding fathers of
abstract expressionism, whether newly-immigrant or native-born but united in
their assimilation of the later surrealist, expressionist and abstracted
examples of such artists as Picasso, Ernst, Miro, Kandinsky. Here the
selection is at its strongest and most spectacular, with Arshile Gorky
beautifully chosen and hung in the Academy's Room II, and the Banqueting
Hall given to de Kooning, Pollock, Francis, Still and Kline. I would say
here that whatever my feelings on the selection itself, the actual display,
both at the Academy and at Saatchi, is admirably done.
But the problems with the selection simply will not go way. With certain,
favoured artists, such as Pollock or de Kooning, the choice is exemplary,
shown in strength and offering something of the proper development of the
work - and if there should be nothing of de Kooning after the mid 1960s,
well, fair enough. But, again, immediately, we tread on a step that is not
there. If Gorky and Pollock are followed through the 1940s, where is Rothko,
whose work of that time is of the first importance as against the more
familiar formulaic paintings of his last 20 years?
And given Kline, where is Motherwell? Was Barnett Newman the only
colour-field painter worth considering after 1960? Where is Morris Louis,
where is Poons? Come to that, where are all the other later painters,
Diebenkorn, Pearlstein, Rivers, Dine? Such lacunae are not so much
inexcuseable as inexplicable, in a survey exhibition. Watch, as one might
say, this space. I return to the matter on Tuesday.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Japanese passion and commitment - Max Loppert attends
a remarkable music festival at the foot of the Japanese Alps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRULY festive music festival offers a special, unrepeatable combination of
place and artistic purpose. The 'Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto' is founded
on one of the world's most remarkable orchestral enterprises, the Saito
Kinen Orchestra of Japan, and located in a provincial city nestling in
beautiful countryside at the foot of the Japanese alps. The orchestra is
remarkable for the quality of its ensemble and character of its players, who
come together only occasionally from around the globe in homage to a
visionary Japanese musician who schooled most of them in western music.
Hideo Saito (1902-74), a cellist and conductor trained in Germany, was
largely responsible for the post-war flourishing of music in Tokyo. In 1948
he founded there the small Music School for Children; 13 years later, after
many struggles, this was expanded into the city's now-celebrated Toho Gakuen
music school. An extraordinarily rich crop of fine musicians has been
germinated by this institution - Ozawa, Japan's international conductor
superstar, was one of the initial intake.
The orchestra gathers its former Toho Gakuen students - at some cost to
themselves - from European or North American symphony orchestras or from the
ranks of internationally established soloists (such as the viola player
Nobuko Imai).
The former pupils first performed together in Tokyo, under Ozawa and the
conductor Kazuyoshi Akiyama (co-director of the orchestra), in their
master's memory in 1984. (Saito Kinen translates as 'memorial to Saito'.)
The success of that memorial concert sowed a seed.
Tours abroad were mooted, and then brought about. London audiences will not
easily forget the three Saito Kinen visits here (Barbican 1987, Proms 1990,
South Bank Japan Festival 1991).
Two years ago Philips started to record the orchestra; and last year the
Saito Kinen Festival was launched with Ozawa as artistic director. According
to report, the entire 1992 ticket allocation was gone within an hour of
first being offered for sale; this year's box office returns told a similar
story.
The 1993 festival programme included chamber music (this year a marvellous
Juilliard Quartet concert of Haydn, Janacek and - with Nobuko Imai - the
Mozart G minor Quintet) and other imaginative programmes (notably a
confrontation of western 19th-century melodrama - poetic recitation with
piano - and Japanese traditions of speech-and-music). But its core,
inevitably, was the three Saito Kinen orchestral concerts and the two
concert-hall staged performances of Honegger's Joan of Arc at the Stake, in
which the orchestra was joined by an international cast. (Last year the
staging had been of Stravinsky's Oedipus rex, with Philip Langridge, Jessye
Norman and Bryn Terfel.)
All three concerts - I attended the latter two - had the Beethoven Seventh
as second half; Schoenberg's Verklarte Nacht in its string-orchestra
arrangement formed the first half of the first and last, the Schubert
Unfinished Symphony that of the middle.
The final-afternoon account of the Schoenberg produced some of the most
astonishingly pure, radiant, fine-grained string-playing I have ever heard.
One expects well-trained Japanese string players to work together precisely
in ensemble; but here the unanimity, controlled intensity and tonal lustre
of the Saito Kinen strings created the illusion that the work was being
returned, in some flawless enlargement, to its original (and preferable)
sextet form.
This was a festival experience to set alongside the most memorable of a
lifetime. Ozawa, whose restless high-octane musical intelligence enables him
to master difficult late-Romantic and 20th-century scores with consummate
skill, has in the past shown himself an unidiomatic conductor of the great
classical symphonies.
At first this seemed still true of his Schubert and Beethoven: the
muscle-power of the strings seemed used only for athletic display, not
invigorating argument. (Philips were recording the performances live, which
may have added to the tension.) But on the final afternoon, with the
recording apparatus now removed, the Beethoven danced and sang with a new
and often exquisitely good-humoured lightness of touch.
The Honegger Joan of Arc, a 1930s 'dramatic oratorio' on a text by Paul
Claudel, was termed a 'vast popular fresco' by its composer. When Ozawa's DG
recording, made with Paris forces, was issued two years ago, I was
particularly troubled by its queasy blending of fulsome mysticism, banal
folksiness and arch infusions of jazz. But this boldly simple staging by the
Paris actor-director Georges Wilson (who also played Brother Dominic, as he
does on the records) made all the elements click into the right dramatic
place.
Marthe Keller, the Swiss actress, was an involving, personable Joan lacking
only a certain French grandeur in her command of rhetoric. The stirring
brilliance and flashing rhythmic articulation of Ozawa and his orchestra
were equalled by a magnificent large combined choir from Tokyo, who in tonal
firmness and eloquence easily surpassed their Radio France opposite numbers
on the DG recording.
To hear Japanese choral singers' impeccable delivery of the French text
provided a noble token of all the passion and commitment that had gone into
the performance - and, indeed, into the Saito Kinen Festival as a whole.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Shock tactics needed - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU, AS a lover of the arts, are being called to the colours. In your
programme at the National Theatre, at the RSC, at ENO, in theatres and
concert halls throughout the land, you will find your recruitment paper, a
leaflet spelling out the threat to the arts in the UK which will follow from
the government's apparent commitment to cut expenditure on the arts, indeed
on the entire heritage, by 2 per cent in the November budget.
Already the shock troops of the arts, the supporters of the Theatre Royal in
Plymouth, have taken to the streets, lobbying yesterday outside the
Department of the National Heritage in London. More discreet consultations
are taking place in private, with businessmen and worthies on the boards of
leading arts companies seizing any opportune meeting with the Prime Minister
to make the case for the arts.
There is a slight element of desperation creeping into the campaign. The
arts establishment is convinced that National Heritage Secretary, Peter
Brooke, has lost his battle with the Treasury; that Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke is indifferent to the arts; and that only the PM can avert a cut,
perhaps even as deep as 5 per cent. This would mean a Pounds 12.5m fall in
the Arts Council's grant.
The leaflets in the programmes are to rally public opinion, and to persuade
arts goers to lobby their MPs, pointing out the flourishing state of the
arts, how profitable they are for the UK.
The Arts Council intends to spread the misery of any cuts evenly around its
clients. It has quietly backtracked on its plan to back winners and punish
losers. Removing grants from clients hardly made the Council look like the
standard bearer for the arts. Those regional theatres threatened with severe
cuts in their grants will not now suffer, and the proposed reduction in the
drama budget will somehow be restored.
There is also an official desire to steam ahead with the completion of the
British Library. If only a little of the Pounds 50m plus going each year
towards its construction in St Pancras could be switched to the performing
arts then a voracious lobby would quickly be quietened.
The art market is still convalescent but the opening of two galleries in
Cork Street suggests a new confidence among dealers.
The appearance of Beaux Art on the site of the old Kasmin Gallery brings to
London a leading Bath dealer. The first show is of sculptures by the late
Elisabeth Frink, priced up to Pounds 56,000. The opening on Wednesday of a
new David Messum gallery on the site vacated by Bill Jackson (he has moved
to New Burlington Street) is fraught with irony.
Messum was forced by the the art market slump, and his bankers, to close his
smart St George Street shop just over a year ago. Messum had virtually
created the market for British Impressionism, and his stock of Newlyn School
and Scottish Colourist pictures was one of the best in the UK and valued at
well over Pounds 1m.
County Bank found that trying to dispose of Messum's stock at auction was a
commercial disaster. Now most of it has been returned to him to sell, and to
his old clients. But in these cautious times the pictures in Cork Street
will be modestly priced (under Pounds 3,500).
The Royal Albert Hall is the latest arts organisation to make its case for
some of the Millennium money to be raised by the Lottery. It did so
gracefully as befits one of the most successful arts bodies in the UK
(profits last year of Pounds 1m on a Pounds 4.4m turnover). It only wants a
one-off Pounds 12m to modernise the Hall and pedestrianise its site.
It joins a queue headed by Covent Garden (seeking Pounds 45m); the Tate
(Pounds 50m for its new gallery of modern art); and Cardiff Opera House
(costed at Pounds 60m), and many more. And still no one has any idea how
much the Lottery, which now looks unlikely to start before 1995, will
produce. The best bet is that the Millennium Fund will get around Pounds 50m
a year.
But here is some good news. There will be two Millenniums, or rather
Millennia. Some arts organisations will want to celebrate in their new or
renovated building on December 31 1999, while others, with a stricter
adherence to truth, know that the new Millennium actually starts at midnight
on December 31, 2000. This gives the Lottery more time to spew forth money.
But one word of warning. The mega international artistes, orchestras, dance
companies, etc., have quickly realised that they can command astronomical
fees for appearing on December 31 in either year, or both. Of course
promoters, who are already starting to plan their programmes, are taking a
terrific gamble on the state of, say, Pavarotti's voice in seven years time,
but amidst all the euphoria of the occasion few will be in a state to
criticise the great man, or the price of tickets at the main arts venues.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (16): A high-value premium
may cost less - Insuring your precious possessions / Specialist underwriters
know that anyone who can afford a home full of rare artefacts usually has
better security than the average householder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICH art collectors living in big houses are generally a better risk for
insurance companies than the average householder, whose most valuable
possession may be a video recorder, yet this is not always reflected in
their respective insurance premiums.
'Most thieves would probably walk straight past a Rembrandt,' says Aron
Shapiro, of Artscope International, specialist fine art brokers. Young,
opportunistic burglars tend to go for easily disposable televisions and
videos, not unique works of art which are much harder to sell in a hurry.
Standard household insurance policies tend to be rated on the assumption
that your home is stuffed full of electrical goods and gold necklaces,
rather than old masters. The main risk that general insurers are concerned
with is theft, whereas for art or antiques, fire or water damage could be a
more serious threat. So collectors may be paying more than they need for
insurance, if they stick to standard policies.
Insurers who specialise in high-value home contents insurance can afford to
offer lower premiums, because claim rates are much lower than average.
Depending on the area, premiums for the high-value items can be as little as
a quarter of those with mainstream policies.
As a rule of thumb, if you are currently paying much more than Pounds 1,000
for household contents insurance, and you have a number of valuable
non-electrical items, it could be worth trying a specialist high-value
policy. Companies have different minimum premiums and sums assured, but if
you are on the borderline, insuring buildings and contents with the same
company could bring you into the net and cost you less overall.
The big names in the field are Hiscox, Nordstern and Sun Alliance, but a
broker should be able to help pick the most appropriate one for you. This
type of insurance is nearly always sold through brokers rather than direct,
as policies have to be tailored to individual requirements, demanding more
involvement from the broker than most off-the-peg household insurance.
Specialist underwriters have learned from experience that anyone who can
afford a home full of rare and beautiful artefacts usually cares enough
about them to have far better security than the average house.
Most proposal forms will ask detailed questions about locks and burglar
alarms, while some insurers insist on carrying out a security audit of your
home, and making recommendations about how to improve it, before accepting
the risk. The good insurers, however, realise that while no one can object
to proper locks, the joy of collecting is ruined if everything has to be
kept in a bank vault or safe.
One problem with collectables is that, unlike stereo equipment, they cannot
easily be valued and replaced once they have disappeared. A customer may
feel that no money can adequately compensate for the loss of his lovingly
built up collection of pre-war cigarette cards, but he will demand
compensation anyway, and the insurance company's business is to attach a
price-tag to the priceless.
However, getting valuations on which both insurer and insured agree can
sometimes be tricky, particularly if the collection is an unusual one. This
is where the insurers' specialist knowledge and contacts can be useful for
finding an authority on the most obscure objects.
Specialist policies often operate on an 'agreed value' basis, which means
that the insurer accepts a valuation for an item and will pay that amount if
a claim is made. This makes the claims procedure simpler, but valuations
must be reviewed periodically to take account of fluctuations in the market.
Apart from price, specialist insurance policies also have the advantage of
cover designed specially to meet collectors' needs. For example, most have
clauses based on the idea that the loss of, or damage to, one item of a pair
or set will reduce the value of the remaining items. Insurers will either
pay for the lost value, or accept the remaining items as salvage and pay for
total loss.
Masterpiece, from Sun Alliance, automatically covers new acquisitions up to
a certain proportion of the total sum insured - so even if your house went
up in flames the day after you had bought a new painting at auction, it
would be covered.
Insurers are also involved in promoting schemes to make it harder for
thieves to dispose of stolen art objects, and improving the chances of
recovery. One is the Art Loss Register, which in spite of its name will
record the loss of not just works of art but any unique or rare item, with a
minimum value of Pounds 1,000. The register is international, and
subscribers include most big insurance companies, dealers and auction
houses. The police are increasingly taking an interest.
Another useful enterprise along the same lines is Trace magazine, which
publishes photographs and descriptions of stolen items, to alert anyone who
may have bought or been offered one. Both these systems rely on owners
keeping photographs and precise descriptions of their belongings in a secure
place for use in case of theft.

EGON by Carey Harrison Heinemann Pounds 14.99 309 pages
SHEAR by Tim Parks Heinemann Pounds 13.99 214 pages
THE POSSESSION OF DELIA SUTHERLAD by Barbara Neil Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99,
247 pages
ON THE strength of Egon, the third novel in a quartet entitled To Liskeard,
Carey Harrison's examination of post-war European consciousness looks set to
become essential reading. (The first two volumes, Richard's Feet and Cley
are available in Minerva paperback.)
It is useful to remember that Harrison, who has written more than 60
television plays, was responsible for BBC2's six-part dramatisation of the
life of Sigmund Freud. Egon opens with a rather odd story, in which an
amnesiac in post-war England is trying to recall the events leading up to a
car crash. Only on page 67 is it revealed that this was a passage of dreams
belonging to a headmaster by the name of Hanbury, who now takes over the
narration.
As we get to know Hanbury we see how his experiences were converted by
dream-work into the earlier configurations. This puzzle-solving is
intriguing in itself, but is only a by-product of Hanbury's real concern:
the 'wolf child', Egon, who was discovered in the forests of East Germany
aged about eight, where he had lived alone since his parents' disappearance
three years before.
Egon is believed to be the son of an aristocratic Anglophile, Peter von
Lutzow-Bruel and his English wife, both of whom were killed after the 1944
assassination plot against Adolf Hitler.
He is rescued by an English uncle, who works in the pornography trade in
Hamburg, and his upbringing is entrusted to a more conventional family
member, a Cornish MP, who sends him, eventually, to Hanbury's school.
The Reverend Dr Hanbury is a decent, self-deprecating Englishman with a
lively sense of humour. He comes to love Egon like a son and their story is
both funny and tragic. Hanbury spends a hilarious Christmas in Hamburg's red
light district looking for Egon's uncle (whom he knew during the war) and
eventually takes Egon back to East Germany where he finds the tree house
that he used to live in.
As Egon's psychological problems start to emerge the novel reads like one of
Freud's case histories. But here the mix is even richer. Identity is a key
theme, and seldom has it been examined with such intelligence, compassion
and wit.
Shear is a thriller of the more intellectual kind which uses its complicated
plot to consider deep existential questions. Peter Nicholson, a 40-year-old
geologist, has taken his 'mistress' with him on a working trip to a
Mediterranean island.
He is tempted to leave his wife, but his 23-year-old girlfriend does not
want to get tied down. Nicholson is an obsessive geologist who tends to see
his mid life crisis in geological terms, an oddly effective analogy that
rescues his tired old dilemma from total banality.
Nicholson is rather naive and easily seduced by Thea, his beautiful but
mysterious interpreter. Things turn nasty when he discovers evidence of a
cover-up at the quarry, which has already led to one man's death.
The plot is absorbing, and the technicalities involved are explained very
clearly. At the same time Tim Parks manages to create a strange, almost
poetic fusion between the real world of stone and the process of Tim's
breakdown. The fine writing is actually more interesting than the character
it is describing. Nicholson is such a self centred prig that his sticky end
seemed richly deserved.
If you are interested in the sort of woman who calls her labradors Bung and
Ho and refes to sex as 'stuffingtons' then The Possession of Delia
Sutherland will suit. Unfortunately this is not a comedy, but a deeply
serious romance.
Delia, who farms Sleet, a 3,000 acre estate in the north of England, marries
an extremely wealthy white Bahamian, Francis.
The marriage soon founders due to his philandering and Delia's lack of
social graces, and they live mostly apart for some 20 years. Because the
dogs ate a rather important letter (I repeat, this is not a comedy) which
Francis wrote to her after a particularly tedious row, and when Francis dies
in an accident, Delia is unaware of a codicil to his original will in which
he leaves Sleet to Leon Kennedy, his love child by a black Bahamian. Leon
turns out to be a charming young man who delights the old retainers and is
soon having a steamy affair with Delia which is, of course, bound to end in
tears.
The whole is recalled from a cafe table in Marseille whither Delia has fled
to lick her wounds. Barbara Neil is such a beguiling story teller that at
the time of reading everything seems quite plausible; only on reflection
does the absurdity of it all reveal itself.

A PRICE BELOW RUBIES: JEWISH WOMEN AS REBELS AND RADICALS by Naomi Shepherd
Weidenfeld Pounds 25, 336 pages
IMAGINE European history with no royal families, no national revolts, no
feudal nobility and no Christianity. Where would women come in? No queens,
no revolutionaries like Joan of Arc, no martyrs, no lovely ladies wooed by
chivalrous knights, and no escape into honourable celibacy for those
unwilling or unable to find a husband.
That, says Naomi Shepherd, is how history looked to Jewish women until the
19th century. In the small Diaspora communities, women were little more than
chattels traded between families in arranged marriages; historically, they
were faceless. Christian culture has romanticised biblical heroines like
Judith and Esther, but they belonged to a period when Jews existed as a
political entity.
For centuries, Jewish society reflected rather the words of the Talmudic
sage, that 'a woman before marriage is a shapeless lump, and concludes a
covenant only with him who transforms her into a useful vessel'. And once
married, religious law, going back to a time when rabbis had even dictated
sexual habits for different workers (twice a week for labourers, once a week
for ass drivers, once a month for camel drivers), dominated every aspect of
private life. No wonder, then, that by the 19th century, intelligent Jewish
girls were frothing with rage against their orthodox families and were among
the first to embrace the revolutionary politics that promised to do away
with social and sexual repression.
This enlightening new book tells the story of the most extravagant and
exciting of these women, and of how their Jewishness inspired and
complicated their radical lives. Here is Rosa Luxembourg, the Spartacist
murdered in Berlin in 1919, landing like a comet from Poland and churning
revolutionary passion through the sedate socialist parties of western
Europe. Here is Manya Shochat, shooting men and posting bodies to fictitious
addresses in Odessa, smuggling pistols in false-bottomed suitcases across
Europe, holding up wedding canopies with rifle butts, and then exporting
Utopian socialism to Palestine and the first kibbutz. Here is neurotic,
civilised Bertha Pappenheim, Freud's 'Anna O', unleashing her frustrated
sexuality on a campaign against Jewish prostitutes. And here is the wild
girl Emma Goldman, agitating for anarchy and sexual freedom in East Side New
York, a symbol of terror to fascinated Americans before she was deported to
Russia in 1918.
Each of these lives makes a noisy, bloodcurdling and satisfying tale,
through which Ms Shepherd threads her observations on the way ideology and
culture translate into political action. How did revolutionary women
reconcile Jewish culture with Marxist internationalism and anti-Zionism? How
did reformers from within, such as Pappenheim, cope with anti-Semitic
prejudice from without? How did early feminists resolve their relations with
male revolutionaries? To many such questions, still relevant today, Ms
Shepherd brings a firm historical perspective and an open mind.
One reservation. By over-emphasising the Jewishness of her heroines, Ms
Shepherd sometimes seriously loses sight of how some women saw themselves
and their goals. She is indignant that Emma Goldman, pacifist and anarchist,
opposes the second world war and Zionism. Luxembourg, revolutionary and
feminist, was simply not interested in things Jewish; Shepherd's suggestion,
that she 'suppressed' her Judaism only to seek, in her death, 'the personal
sacrifice expected of the Jewish women, implicit in Jewish tradition', is
nonsense. But these are small flaws in an always entertaining and original
piece of social history.

THE GREAT SAFARI: THE LIVES OF GEORGE AND JOY ADAMSON by Adrian House
Harvill Pounds 20, 465 pages
HIGH IN the bestseller lists of the 1960s and '70s was a trio of
artlessly-told, beautifully-illustrated books about a lion cub who was
adopted by a Kenyan couple, reared, and then returned to the bush. Born
Free, Living Free and Forever Free sold in their millions; the image of the
happy pair was probably most effectively conveyed by the film of Born Free,
in which Joy and George Adamson were played - wonderfully - by a thespian
couple, Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers. Virginia McKenna in those days
was the archetypal girl-next-door, and Bill was an appropriately beefy and
amiable partner. The casting was brilliantly successful - and grotesquely
misleading.
The fact is that Joy Adamson was a monster, George was a wretched,
long-suffering spouse, usually living apart from her, and the marriage had
been made in hell. In their different ways, their lives were rescued by the
animals of East Africa.
Adrian House was their London editor, and has at last written the history of
the Adamsons. It is one of those biographies which, regrettably, feels
obliged to cram in everything the author knows, from the Scramble for Africa
to the history of Mau Mau; it is not well written; but the story comes
through, and has a horrifying compulsion. For anyone who remembers the books
or the films, this is a fascinating read.
The Adamsons represented two opposite faces of White Kenya. George was a
classic example of the dedicated game warden, always happiest in the
ferocious terrain of the Northern Frontier District, where the Somalis
persist in their southern migration (they would eventually murder him). Joy,
originally 'Fifi', was a neurotic Austrian cosmopolitan with two husbands
behind her, a Nazi step-father, broken English, pretensions to culture, a
passion for the safari, a record of dissatisfied promiscuity, and a chronic
inability to be civil to her servants (who would eventually murder her).
Mr House is on George's side, but his portrait of the appalling Joy has the
stink of truth. Heaven knows why George put up with her for 35 years; Mr
House concludes, in effect, that he was a gent. She married him in a grand
and mutual passion, went off him sexually within a fortnight, developed a
renewed craving for her (equally long-suffering) Swiss ex-husband, and - as
all Kenya knew - made George's life miserable for much of the time. She even
refused him a share of the fortune she made from the books, although his
role in the dramas of Elsa and her cubs was fundamental. He was only saved
from penury by the films Bill Travers made with him later, and the spin-off
books under his own name in the 1980s.
Nothing in this domestic tragedy would be a particularly unusual story in
Kenya if it were not for the lions. Why did Joy's first book have such an
extraordinary impact? The answer, at its simplest, is not hard to
understand. In Peter Scott's words, 'as an example of near perfect
relationships between man and animal, it is unique'. Plenty of game wardens
had raised lion cubs, but Elsa reached maturity, was successfully released
into the wild, and then retained her affection for the human 'parents' even
after she had mated and borne cubs.
So, for many people, this apparently ordinary story was unexpectedly moving
because it seemed to offer them a bridge between man and the natural world
at a time when - we can now see - we were beginning obscurely to worry about
this gap. (Other books were having a similar effect at the time: see, for
instance, the otters and Gavin Maxwell, whose biography also appears this
month). At a deeper level of interpretation - and Mr House only flirts with
this point but he is at least aware of it - it would be necessary to go into
the legendary role of the lion in the life of man throughout the ages.
There was a debate about the value of the Adamsons' work. They were not
scientists, so what was the significance of their anthropomorphic
observations? After all, lions were never an endangered species, so why all
the fuss? And wasn't it dangerous to return these lions to the bush, and in
particular to a national park? Were the Adamsons producing man-eaters? (In
later years George was to be directly and painfully confronted by this
point.)
The conclusion today seems to be that the Adamsons' observations added
something to the sum of human knowledge and offered the conservationists
various lines for future inquiry. More important, I suspect, is the very
simple point that the Adamsons transformed public opinion in that they did
more than anyone to make lions accessible, wonderful, majestic, loveable, to
all of us.
After Elsa, Joy reared a cheetah and also raised leopard cubs. She had a big
affair with Billy Collins, her publisher, described here in discrete detail.
She saw less and less of George. She wounded her hand and lost her separate
career as an extremely distinguished artist of Kenya's flora and
anthropology. She was killed in 1980.
George had retreated to a remote camp on his beloved Tana River and lived to
a hearty old age, rearing lion cubs and entertaining British soldiers and
uninhibited young ladies. Then, in 1989, the Somalis came and killed him. He
was, in Adrian House's affectionate portrait, rather a hero.

THE LETTERS OF NANCY MITFORD: LOVE FROM NANCY edited by Charlotte Mosley
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 20, 538 pages
IN THOSE country houses where bedrooms are always kept ready for guests,
this collection of Nancy Mitford's letters will make an appropriate addition
to the books thoughtfully placed there. One or two of these effervescent
epistles should provide an ideal nightcap. But consumed in bulk in the
belief that here is a volume comparable in readability to novels like The
Pursuit of Love, Love in a Cold Climate, The Blessing, or period-pieces like
Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire in Love, The Sun King, the reader is likely to
suffer rejection symptoms.
Nancy Mitford was a compulsive letter writer. For much of her life she was
isolated geographically from the people she loved most and she poured out
her thoughts to them in a ceaseless flow. The fact that so much of what she
writes seems at this distance of time gushingly trivial is not really her
fault. There was no thought of pleasing posterity when these letters were
written nor of eventual publication - only of keeping the gossip going.
Occasionally letters written for purely private consumption do have the
lasting worth to become literature. The classic instance is the
correspondence of the Marquise de Sevigne (1626-96). She wrote long chatty
letters almost every day to her daughter in another part of France. Nancy's
friend Violet Hammersley, 'the Wid' - to whom many of the letters in this
book are addressed - made an English translation of Mme de Sevigne.
The comparison is not to Nancy's advantage. The Marquise was involved in
much of what was going on both at the court and in the country. We owe to
her, for instance, an account of the trial of Fouquet; of Vatel's, Louis
XIV's chef's, suicide; of a performance of Racine's tragedy Esther. By
contrast Nancy seems often tediously absorbed in her own domestic affairs,
in buying modish clothes, and in keeping track of who among her wide circle
of well-born friends was currently liaising or quarreling with whom.
The war forced her to emerge from her shell; a wartime job in a Mayfair
bookshop gave her a sense of the workaday world, though many of the
customers were her own smart friends. On one occasion, just after the war,
her rapidly blossoming reputation as a novelist took her into the
hurly-burly of the theatre. She was commissioned in 1949 by HM Tennant to
make an English version of Andre Roussin's comedy The Little Hut. Nancy did
a fine job, gaining a long run on Shaftesbury Avenue for the piece and
providing Robert Morley with a juicy starring role.
Nancy was worried about what the author would say to her embellishments of
his piece. 'I guess' she concluded, 'so long as it goes well and makes money
he won't mind'. He didn't; but disappointingly we get no account of the
meeting between them or of the first night. Her friendship with the director
 -Peter Brook, aged 25, and already well-known - comes to a sudden
unexplained full-stop, and in spite of a handsome share of the gross, she is
turned off working for the theatre for the rest of her life. It is almost as
if even that degree of exposure to - in her eyes - a common environment was
too much for her.
What we have, then, is a high-level Aga saga; the Aga in her case being the
Aga Khan. Nancy meets him at a party given by Daisy Fellowes at her
apartment in Paris in 1948, one of thousands of similar gatherings she
attended. 'Mrs Rodd?' he greets her. 'Your grandfather was a great friend of
mine . . . I expect you know he just fell between two stools - it doesn't do
for brilliant people to be snobs or snobs to be brilliant'.
The Aga put his finger on it. For Nancy and her friends, snobbery was their
greatest commitment, transcending all other affiliations, professional,
political, religious. The extent of the name-dropping in these letters may
be gauged by the amount of work the editor Charlotte Mosley has had to do to
make them comprehensible to the reader who comes to them un-Debretted. It is
nothing short of heroic.
There have been two biographies of Nancy Mitford - a personal one by Harold
Acton and a comprehensive one by Selena Hastings; and we also have an
account of her within the context of the whole family-group in Jonathan
Guiness's The House of Mitford (1984). The Letters put more flesh on these
biographical bones: they give insights into her draconian childhood, her
disastrous marriage to Peter Rodd ('Prod'), whom she did not succeed in
divorcing until 1957. She met her great passionate attachment, the Gaullist
Free French diplomat, Colonel Gaston Palewski in London during the war, and
followed him to Paris afterwards. She never became his wife or his mistress
but enjoyed his company often and was in regular communication with him
until her death in 1973. Even at her most abject her letters to him have
unfailing high-spirits, her redeeming virtue.
He is always addressed in English; as 'Dear darling' or sometimes jokingly
as 'Dear Colonial'. Many of her friends and relations are likewise known by
their in-group nick-names. Those for her own family have become common
currency thanks to the books they have published about each other - Farv,
Muv (Lord and Lady Redesdale), Debo (Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire) Decca
(Jessica), Bobo (Unity, Hitler's admirer who attempted suicide and died in
1948), Bodley (Diana, Lady Mosley) to whom she wrote many of the letters
printed here. But who the heck are Keck, Lulu, Honks and Boots? Answer:
Cecil Beaton, Louise de Vilmorin, Lady Diana Cooper, Cyril Connolly. All
such sobriquets are explicated by Charlotte Mosley in a rash of square
brackets within the text.
Snobbery breeds deep enmities. Thus the full nickname given to Connolly,
perhaps the most brilliant, if not the most snobbish of them all, was
Smarty-Boots. When the tables are turned on him and Evelyn Waugh gives The
Unquiet Grave a stinking review in The Tablet, Nancy tells Waugh how much
she enjoyed his 'Boots-baiting'. Waugh was her great mentor and in her
letters to him she is at her most candid. 'You must remember' she tells him
almost in tears at his strictures on the manuscript of Love in a Cold
Climate, 'That I'm an uneducated woman (her emphasis)'.
Nancy also tells Waugh what happened when her mother dined with the Colonel.
She picked all the truffles out of her omelette and left them. 'The Col
delighted - Most people pick out the truffles and leave the rest, very
patrician of her'. Pace Lady Redesdale, I feel that the best way to read
this book is the non-patrician way. To pick out the truffles and leave the
rest.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Books: Japan is no joke

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE by Joe Joseph Viking, Pounds 15.99 275 pages
CAUGHT IN A MIRROR: REFLECTIONS OF JAPAN by Lisa Martineau Macmillan, Pounds
16.99 305 pages
SILENT THUNDER by Peter Tasker Orion, Pounds 14.99 287 pages
WITH ITS mixture of ancient and modern, East and West, deep spiritual roots
yet ruthless pursuit of hedonistic pleasures, Japan is one of the most
fascinating countries to observe, but one of the most complicated to explain
to a western audience. It is particularly difficult for Western newspaper
editors to understand, with their desire to package the world into a few
colourful paragraphs.
One approach is to look at the ways in which Japan differs from the rest of
the world. Clearly, there are enough of those to give Joe Joseph a whale of
a time, reporting on the initiation rites of freshmen 'salarymen' as Japan's
business executives are called, on the role of women - 'a woman's place is
in the wrong' - on one of the world's richest men who mends his shoes with
black sticky tape, on the profusion of political scandals and the new
'modern Mikado.'
Long before the end the task has overwhelmed Joseph. Admittedly, he seems
happy enough, poking fun and pausing long enough to mint and polish his own
phrases which, sadly, have 'Look what a clever boy I am' stamped over them.
He skims the surface of Japanese life. Though his subtitle is 'Strange but
not strangers' he gives little indication of having got to know or
understand any Japanese. Much of his material could have been culled from
newspaper cuttings, especially those detailing the oddities and idiocies of
Japanese life, of which there are many, but they do not make the whole
story.
Some of his facts are wrong - the Japanese are not second to America in
defence spending, but fourth or fifth, depending on the strength of the yen.
Some of his statements are crass, for example: 'Yoshiaki Tsutsumi carries on
a feud with his half-brother Seiji that makes Cain and Abel look chummy.'
But didn't Cain killed Abel and aren't both Tsutsumis alive and well and
masters of big business empires? Joseph used to be the Tokyo correspondent
of The Times, and his book is also a reflection of the declining
international role of once great British newspapers. With the exception of
the FT, the British press sees Japan as rich but still rather comic. News
editors will leap at stories that poke fun and ignore seminal events as too
boring.
Lisa Martineau is aware of western ignorance about Japan and early on draws
attention to it: 'As it was in the 1890s it is in the 1990s: the Japanese
know much more about us than we know about them.'
She does not talk down, either to her readers or the Japanese, and resists
the temptation to make cheap jokes. Instead, she takes off on an exploration
of Japan, beyond plate-glass Tokyo and into the depth of the countryside.
Patiently, letting the Japanese speak for themselves, she draws the curtains
to reveal the life and the feelings of today's Japanese. It is a highly
personal journey, but carefully observed, sometimes touchingly amusing and
always informative.
I wish, though, that Martineau had offered more support for her claim that
'young (Japanese) people firmly expect they will have to fight a war with
America.' More unfortunately, the book is marked by the absence of an index,
for which the useful glossary does not make up, and by some sloppy errors.
She talks of the Nankyu Braves baseball team when they were sold to Orix in
1988 and became the Orix Braves. She claims that Nanae Mori is the wife
(presumably widow now) of the real estate magnate Taikichiro Mori, who died
recently.
For something completely different, try Tasker's novel, a romp. Tasker is a
serious man, Balliol and Kleinwort Benson, and won the title of Japan's most
respected research analyst last year. He has produced an unbelievable tale
of the seamy side of modern Japan, full of its corrupt lines between
politicians, bureaucrats and gangsters and littered with dead bodies. Its
sleazy hero is a character you can warm to. He has a sharp eye for the
Japanese underworld. And as for the unbelievable plot, who would have
believed the true stories of Japanese corruption unearthed with the
investigation of ruling party 'Godfather' Shin Kanemaru?

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (15): Keep it in the
family - on your own terms - Creating a trust / Great care is needed in
drafting the legal document, and in the selection of trustees, if it is both
to satisfy the Inland Revenue and also to be effective against rapacious
relatives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANY SERIOUS investor knows how difficult it is to make capital and how easy
it is to lose it. But a trust can be a useful weapon in an armoury to
protect capital from rapacious relatives and the ravages of taxation.
A trust is the legal relationship between a settlor (the person who provides
the funds), the trustee (the person who holds the funds), and the
beneficiary (the person for whom the funds are held).
The settlor creates a trust, usually by means of a document, which can
either be part of a Will, in which case it does not come into effect until
death, or by a trust deed, in which case it can come into effect as soon as
the funds are transferred to the trustees.
To be effective against rapacious relatives, the trust must be carefully
drafted. For example, if you want your son to inherit your wealth, but not
so as to fritter your capital on wasting assets, you could include a trust
in your Will, so that he is only paid the income during his lifetime, but is
not entitled to the capital without the trustees' consent. The capital can
thereby be protected for his children provided your trustees have invested
the capital sensibly and are able to resist your family's frivolous demands.
Of course, this means that you must choose your trustees and their
successors with care. During your lifetime there is no reason why you and
your spouse should not be trustees, with or without a trusted adviser or
friend. Only if there is no one you trust and who is resident in a suitable
jurisdiction need you pick a professional trustee. A suitable jurisdiction
is one which recognises trusts, such as the UK or the Channel Islands. An
unsuitable jurisdiction is one which does not recognise the Anglo Trust,
such as France or Germany.
To be tax-efficient, a trust should be drafted by a lawyer familiar with
trust tax legislation. For example, a simple clause giving the trustees
power to accumulate the income could dramatically affect the trust's
tax-effectiveness.
Trusts are taxed according to the type of trust and the relationship between
the settlor and the beneficiary. The type of trust depends on what the
trustees can do with the income of the trust fund. If the trustees must pay
all the income of the trust to a particular beneficiary - the 'life tenant'
 -then the trust is an 'interest in possession' trust. All other trusts are
'discretionary' trusts, because the trustees either have discretion as to
which beneficiary should receive the income or how much the beneficiary
should get, leaving the trustees free to accumulate what remains of the
income with the existing capital of the trust fund.
One important sub-class of a discretionary trust is the 'accumulation and
maintenance' trust, for children under the age of 25. Provided the
conditions set out in the inheritance tax legislation are met, the penal IHT
provisions imposed on discretionary trusts can then be avoided.
Family wishes and tax objectives are not always compatible, but with care a
good compromise can usually be found.
For example, say you would like to set up a trust to take advantage of the
favourable IHT provisions which you do not think will last for many more
years. Your children are aged only 18 and 20, and at the moment you have no
grandchildren. Ideally, you would like to set up a discretionary trust for
your children and grandchildren, so that the capital and income can be
accumulated until such time as either your children or your grandchildren
(assuming you get any) need it. However, you do not want to pay up to a
maximum of 20 per cent IHT on setting it up or up to 6 per cent IHT every 10
years.
One way of achieving your wishes in the most tax-efficient way would be to
set up an accumulation and maintenance settlement for your children, so that
the income can be accumulated, at least until your children reach the age of
25. Thereafter, the trust will become an interest in possession trust, and
the income will have to be paid to your children or for their benefit.
However, provided the children are well provided for, there is nothing to
stop you as trustee switching the investment policy, so that little or no
income arises to the trust and therefore little or no money need be paid out
of the trust to the children at that time. Then, when the grandchildren
arrive, you, as trustee, can exercise a power of appointment and appoint
part or all of the funds away from your children to your grandchildren, at
which point the income can once again be accumulated without adverse tax
consequences.
The most tax effective trust, of course, is one set up by a 'non-UK
domiciled' settlor for UK resident beneficiaries (one of whom could be the
settlor) with trustees resident in a tax haven. This trust can effectively
avoid UK income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax if carefully
structured and managed.
If a trust is to be created, for whatever reason, it must be remembered that
tax laws can change, beneficiaries can die out of order, and people can live
longer or shorter than expected. It is not always possible to unravel a
trust, and therefore it should be drafted with care, treated with respect
and not entered into lightly.

solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Motoring: Where big is best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MERCEDES-Benz had the misfortune to introduce the new S-Class
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
its biggest, dearest car for a generation - just as Europe moved into
recession.
Sales may not have lived up to the most optimistic expectations but all
makes of large luxury cars have had a tough time recently.
However, the S-Class Has not been the disaster some commentators would have
you believe. As Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz president and chief executive
officer, said at Frankfurt show last week, it is still several lengths ahead
of the competition with a 27 per cent share of market segment.
The S-Class, like Rolls-Royce's off-the-peg models, is being promoted as a
tool for high-mileage business professionals, not a status symbol. Can this
be justified?
Having driven one to Frankfurt and back last week, I think it can. For me,
there is a direct relationship between car size and relaxed comfort. On long
motorway journeys, there can be no question that big and spacious cars are
best. S-Class buyers drive larger than average annual mileages, which rather
proves the point.
The model I drove was a sign of the times; a six-cylinder, 2.8-litre engined
S280, budget priced at Pounds 37,500; the multi-cylinder versions cost
between Pounds 51,400 (S400 saloon) and Pounds 97,400 (S600 coupe).
Compared with the S-Class V8s' 286 or 308 horsepower and the V12's massive
389 bhp, the 197 bhp output of the S280's multi-valve six may seem modest.
But it is marginally more than that of the 3-litre engine of the former
300S. In the real world, the S280 does not feel underpowered. A 0-100 kph
(0-62 mph) time of 10.7 seconds and a maximum speed of 130 mph (210 kph) are
claimed.
It has to be fairly low geared but it swooped along the autobahn at a legal
100 mph (161 kph) and 4,000 rpm in doubled-glazed near-silence. The only
time the engine raised its voice was when I kicked down from top to second
for sharp acceleration when baulked on a hill.
A heavy-footed driver who expected the S280 to go like an S500 would fare
worse but I averaged a very reasonable 22.45 mpg (12.58 l/100km) and had no
need to tank up between Dover and Frankfurt. The S280 is no stripped-out
shell of a car to keep the price down. It comes with driver and front
passenger airbags, ABS brakes, automatic transmission, walnut trim, tinted
glass, outside temperature gauge, anti-theft system including engine
immobiliser and power-adjusted, heated mirrors that fold flat at the touch
of a button.
The main casualty is air conditioning and there is no radio. Mercedes always
lets customers choose - and pay for - their own. For an extra Pounds 1,500
buyers can have an electric tilt / slide sunroof (still usable at 60 mph/96
kph), power-adjusted steering wheel and headlamp wash/wipe. Alternatively,
Pounds 4,655 extra buys computer-controlled air conditioning, leather seats
and eight-hole alloy wheels.
There is a huge amount of room for up to five people inside an S-Class, with
boot capacity to match. Buyers probably fly first class just to get the same
amount of space around them.
Understandably, its bulk is unwelcome in town and fitting it into a
multi-storey may call for some nipping and tucking. But on open roads and
motorways the S-Class is supreme. The loudest noise was tyre whine on some
autobahn surfaces. I forgot how good the suspension was until I noticed
other cars bobbing up and down on ill-maintained surfaces while the 280S
rode flat.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Dozy days ahead: Country note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAY my wife wrecked her car was a good one for dormice. In no time the
recently vacated car-port was taken over by three large cages and I was
licensed as a keeper in the dormouse captive breeding and release scheme.
Dormice are mouse-sized rodents, ginger in colour with furry tails, which
hibernate for more than half the year and emerge during darkness to feed
high in the trees.
It is hardly surprising that their numbers had become severely depleted
before anyone noticed.
It was not always thus. The hazel dormouse tends to live in areas of hazel
coppice where the spreading limbs of the older trees provide it with aerial
routes essential for its arboreal lifestyle. Rich hazelnuts enable it to
almost double its weight before hibernation.
In the past, coppicing was a major industry in the countryside and hazel was
an important component of the rural scene, providing material for hurdles,
thatching pegs, tool handles and fuel for charcoal.
Woodsmen often came across dormice and they were kept as pets by children.
In 1882, Theodore Compton, in his book on the Mendip Hills, wrote: 'The
pretty dormouse, more squirrel than mouse, is sometimes caught by our
village boys who call it the seven sleeper.' The dormouse often sleeps for
seven months of the year.
This long hibernation is matched in the summer by periods of torpor, when
the weather is poor or food is scarce, from which the dormouse can take up
to 15 minutes to awaken.
The disappearance of hazel coppice and hedgerows has not only deprived
dormice of their habitat but also their means to move from one wood to
another, for they rarely come down to the ground unless to hibernate. Many
coppice woodlands have been reclaimed for agriculture while others have been
felled and replanted with conifers.
Even those purchased by conservation organisations generally have been
managed to encourage woodland flora. Such regimes are rarely sympathetic to
the needs of the dormouse.
It is to emphasise the plight of this elusive and secretive mammal that
English Nature, as part of its Species Recovery Programme, has declared
eight days next month, October 27 to November 3, National Dormouse Week.
Information will be available on the threat to dormice and their habitat,
guidance on the special needs of dormice will be given to woodland owners
and managers, and everyone will be invited to take part in the Great Nut
Hunt.
Dormice extract the nut kernels from hazel shells in a characteristic way
and, by searching for such shells and sending them to a centre, members of
the public can help English Nature to improve its knowledge of the status
and distribution of these mammals.
Dormice are thought to have disappeared completely from a number of northern
and eastern counties of Britain. Only recently, for instance, were they
discovered in a Northumberland wood and none is believed to exist in
Scotland.
The Great Nut Hunt will continue into 1994 and it is hoped that as many
people as possible, especially children, will take part.
An increasing number of woodlands are being found which, possibly because of
benign neglect over the years, have all the right ingredients to supply the
needs of dormice yet lack the animals themselves.
The captive breeding scheme aims to put dormice back into these woods by
controlled releases of dormice bred in captivity. The parents of the
released animals are taken from the wild in the autumn if, on November 1,
they weigh less than 14g (half an ounce).
Late litters do not have time to amass enough fat to keep them ticking over
during hibernation. Under normal circumstances they would die.
Instead, they are taken into captivity and fed throughout the winter.
Their young are released into the wild using special release cages. These
contain food so the dormice can return at night to supplement their diet
until they have learned enough to fend for themselves. Several animals were
released last spring using this method, into a secret woodland location in
the eastern counties.
These dormice bred during the summer and four litters have been recorded.
Now they have to find suitable places to hibernate and survive the winter -
the most dangerous part of any hibernator's life. But then sleeping seems to
be what dormice do best.
To take part in the Great Nut Hunt, write to: English Nature, (NDW),
Northminster House, Peterborough, PE1 1UA or Countryside Council for Wales
(NDW), 43-45 The Parade, Roath, Cardiff, CF2 3UH for a survey pack which
includes full instructions.
The Mammal Society has published a useful booklet called Dormice, by Paul
Bright and Pat Morris. Pounds 2.50 inc p&amp;p from the Mammal Society Office,

FT  18 SEP 93 / Motoring: Promising concepts for your family - Frankfurt
Show / Stuart Marshall has been looking at exciting cars of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE a car that at four metres (13ft 4in) long is shorter than a Toyota
Corolla hatchback but has more rear seat room than a Toyota Lexus LS400
luxury saloon. The floor, front and back, is completely flat. Its 1.8 litre
lean-burn engine drives the front wheels through a four-speed automatic
transmission.
If you think it sounds like a very sensible family car for the mid-1990s, I
can only agree. But there is more. Accelerator, foot and parking brakes are
electronically operated, like the 'fly-by-wire' controls in the latest
aircraft, though with fail-safe mechanical back-up.
The driver sits high. To make parking in tight places easier, only the first
30 cm (12 in) of the bonnet are out of sight. The digital speedometer is a
'head up' display - you see the speed reflected in the windscreen without
having to lower your eyes from the road.
A single enormous motor-driven door on each side moves slightly out and then
back at a finger touch, with the rear view mirrors folding automatically.
Even if you have to park very closely to the car alongside, getting out will
not be a struggle.
This paragon of commonsense is called the Toyota Raum. I rated it the most
practical and promising of all the concept cars at Frankfurt Show. Although
Raum is clearly a concept car, it could be produced now, using existing
factory facilities. But will it? Toyota says it is not a technological tour
de force, just good old-fashioned innovation, and is a good indication of
what might find it way into Toyota dealerships in the not-too-distant
future.
Among other eye-catching concept cars at Frankfurt were the Buick Sceptre, a
rear wheel driven, supercharged 3-litre V6 engined four-door with active
suspension and styling that might grow on one, and the Mitsubishi HSR-IV and
ESR.
The HSR-VI has a 1.6-litre V6 but one complete bank of cylinders is shut off
at low speeds, reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. All four
wheels drive and steer.
ESR (for ecology, science and research) is a futuristic hybrid vehicle,
driven by nickel-hydrogen batteries recharged by a 1.5-litre petrol engine.
It looks like a Star Wars prop, seats four, is fitted with six air bags for
all-round passenger protection, has a top speed of 124 mph (200 kph) and a
range of up to 625 miles (1,000 km).
I never dismiss concepts like ESR as flights of high-tech fancy. My
grandchildren may be driving them in 20 years time.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Gardening: Clear colours and new varieties for autumn -
Pokers are no longer overheated and crocosmias are getting more and more
unusual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN POURING rain this week, gardeners have been able to shelter and enjoy
their Great Autumn Show. I am not sure which is more welcome. The rains have
brought fresh colour to my fuchsias and lengthened the season of the late
sweet peas. The two-day show is held yearly in London's Royal Horticultural
Society halls and continues to raise my sights for autumn. The days seem far
behind us when gardeners complained of too much strong yellow and believed
that dahlias were all vulgar.
In a Great Autumn Show you no longer see chrysanthemums: they now have to
wait until late October. Instead, you confront clear colours in new
varieties from old and new families. Some of them have emerged in families
which used to be all orange and hectic, crocosmias, perhaps, or over-heated
Pokers.
Nowadays, the main Poker at the shows is the pale yellow Little Maid, a
marked reversal of colour and gender. Other pale colours have turned up in
half-hardy families, spread around for the new plantfinding market: I
continue to profit from Brian Hiley's unusual forms of half-hardy salvias
for pots.
Some particularly rewarding forms are coming back from the wild, not least
from Roy Lancaster's recent collections in China. From Paradise Centre in
Suffolk, I admired a tall white-flowered Artemisia called Ghizou but its
exhibitors do not yet list saleable plants of this border-flower for the
future, dark-stemmed and holding its flowers at pleasantly wide intervals to
a height of 4ft or 5ft.
I also admired a new bright apricot Lychnis called cognata. There seem to be
no problems here. Carol Klein, of Glebe Cottage Nurseries, raised it from
seed collected in China and rightly placed it in the foreground of her
outstanding exhibit. She foresees no difficulty with it and so I have bought
one. Lychnis cognata grows about 1 1/2 ft high and has rounded flowers like
an enlarged form of haageana, whose colour is a sensational shade of
apricot. If it continues to flower in autumn, it will soon be all over the
garden centres: whatever will China be found to be hosting next?
Wherever you look nowadays on the smaller stands of hardy plants, good
exhibitors are showing unusual crocosmias, those easy-growing corms with
rushy leaves and flowers which used to be in various shades of orange. Once
upon a time, the red and orange forms were believed to be tender but they
are proven survivors in the worst winters of discontent.
Will the new pale yellows and apricots prove to be so tough when we have a
really testing season? I have been trying to pick the better forms, helped
by John Metcalf, of Four Seasons Nurseries, at Forncett, St Mary, Norwich,
Norfolk NR16 1JT, who supplies by mail order only. Like his exhibit, he has
a sharp sense of the best performers and best value.
Many of us have been struggling with Crocosmia Emily McKenzie, which has
orange flowers with a brown blotch but never seems to last for very long. I
have been blaming my cultivation. Metcalf agrees, and although he sells this
variety, he does not reckon much to it. He prefers the new Star of the East,
which he does not yet stock but which I value for its star-shaped flowers in
orange and its long season at a height of about 2ft. Among the paler
yellows, any visitor to the show would choose Citronella, which is also one
of the cheaper varieties: I have bought one to celebrate and can imagine it
in a sunny bed among the blues of autumn. I also fancy the pale apricot
Solfatare, which has pleasantly bronzed leaves but which does not always
flower freely.
Nobody is entirely certain that these pale-flowered forms will survive a
hard frost but there is one helpful trick: try to feed them with a potash
fertiliser from July onwards so that they build up stronger corms below
ground before the frost.
Other varieties keep turning up, including a newish bright yellow called
George Davison, which looks too orange to my eye, and the older James Cooey,
which has small flowers and has not made much of an impact with me in the
past five years. I would put Citronella first, at least until the winter
sorts it out.
On acid soil, anyone would be seduced by copying the exhibit from Edrom
Nurseries, in Scotland, and multiplying the many forms of autumn gentian as
an edging to their borders. The pale blues and the best white form are quite
appealing but the best are surely the deep blues, which we all associate
with this superb plant for cool northern gardens. I wish that everyone would
plant it instead of yet more heather: once again, the best form seemed to me
to be one of the cheapest, the dark blue macaulayi.
Patient gardeners might consider giving it the background blue of a new
shrub with blue-coloured leaves. Fothergilla Blue Mist was being shown by
Starborough Nurseries below some good specimens of Nyssa sylvatica, which
colours so prettily to red and orange in its leaves. Both these plants grow
slowly and need patience, moisture and no lime. Nonetheless, they ought to
be taken up by gardeners with the right soil and the need to find something
for autumn among a core of azaleas.
As always, I fell for Aylett's marvellous dahlias, the reputation of those
who think that there is nothing between the awful forms with mauve pompons
and the over-estimated red Bishop of Llandaff. A few, well-chosen forms add
backbone and soft colour to a border from August onwards: if you disbelieve
me, you can see them at their best in the National Trust's flowerbeds at
Hidcote before you walk forwards up the famous Red Border.
This year, the pink form with flowers like waterlilies, called Emily
Crutchfield, look irresistible. Alternatively, there is even a pink called
Gay Princess, about the only novelty which the tabloids have still not
sprung on us.
Thirty years ago, I remember the old Great Autumn idiom: apples on plates
against green hessian; musty heleniums and chrysanthemums already on the
in-curve. Nowadays, the best Michaelmas Daisies are small-flowered with
names like Coombe Fishacre, a pale pink, and Little Carlow, a tall
violet-blue at up to 6ft. Neither suffers from the dreaded mildew, which
upsets the older show varieties, especially those with red flowers.
Conscious of the changing fashion, I found myself circling past the tweed
skirts and back to Glebe Cottage's enterprising stand. Even the familiar
Japanese Anemone has taken a new turn in their observant care. They have
picked out a rich rose-pink called Eugenie: she is a richer pink and has an
unusually pretty shape to the flower, which sets her apart from the other
pink forms of the well-known japonica.
She shares their willingness to flourish in dry shade. She is the sort of
speciality which you only see at a seasonal show and so I blessed the RHS's
new willingness to allow plants to be bought throughout show hours and left
with Eugenie in a polythene bag with the RHS symbol. Thirty years ago, not
only the plants were more limited: shopping was strictly curtailed, to the
visitors' disadvantage.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (14): Be sure your Will is
correctly drawn - Inheritance tax planning / The government's budget deficit
may be be an ominous sign for people who want to pass some wealth on to the
next generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY STILLERMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INHERITANCE TAX has been called a 'voluntary tax'. It is possible to give
away a large part of your wealth, and if you survive for seven years from
the date of the gift, no IHT will be payable.
Indeed, the rules have never been more generous, with some businesses and
farming land now fully exempt from inheritance tax.
However, the cloud on the horizon is the current budget deficit. The
government needs to raise money from somewhere, and while it is more likely
that the finance will be found from VAT, national insurance and income tax,
which are more widely based, it is quite possible that inheritance tax rates
could increase or the regime be changed so that it is less flexible.
The table shows that it is important to ensure that your will is
tax-efficient.
A husband and wife each have a nil band of Pounds 150,000. In the first
example, that band is not being used by the husband, so that Pounds 340,000
is payable to the Inland Revenue when the wealth passes to the children on
the second death. However, in the second example, both husband and wife
utilise their nil rate band on their respective deaths, thereby saving
Pounds 60,000 of tax.
If you examine the value of your estate, your house may be one of your
largest assets. It is also a non-income producing asset, so that, if it were
to be given away, your income would not fall. Unfortunately the
gift-with-reservation provisions do not allow you to merely give your house
to beneficiaries, such as your children, if you continue to live there while
they do not. If you do so and do not pay a market rent to your children,
then the provisions will still enable the Inland Revenue to tax the value of
your home as though it were part of your estate.
However, these provisions do not apply on death, so that if a husband and
wife were to hold their house as tenants in common, they could then give a
share of the house to their children, or in trust for their children, on the
first death. This is a useful way of using the nil rate band.
For example, if the house is worth Pounds 300,000, then a half share of the
house could be given to the children on the first death, with the surviving
spouse keeping the remaining 50 per cent share.
This does not give the surviving spouse security of tenure, as the children
could force a sale of the property; but if the family relationship is sound,
it may be a good way of using the nil rate band.
There are other methods of giving away a house while continuing to live
there using certain leasehold arrangements, but a great deal of care is
required in these more complex arrangements, which should only be considered
if the value of the home is very significant.
If you are the founder of your family business, the improvement in business
property relief discourages you from passing your shares to your children,
because, if those shares are increasing in value, your children would
acquire the shares at probate value for capital gains tax purposes on your
death. However, it is quite possible that business property relief at 100
per cent may not be available forever, so that you may wish to consider a
making a gift of shares now while there may be no charge to stamp duty,
capital gains tax or inheritance tax.
Many wealthy individuals are too concerned with the Pounds 3,000 IHT annual
exemption. Although they are correct in taking advantage of this tax
exemption, planning should not end here, as a larger gift only becomes
taxable if the donor dies within seven years; and after three years,
tapering relief applies so as to reduce the tax charge.
Also, if you have surplus income after tax and your normal living
expenditure, then this income can be given to your children without
inheritance tax being payable if properly structured.
The following illustrates the points:
                     Pounds 000
Taxable income               80
Tax (say)                   (26)
Annual expenditure          (40)
Regular annual gifts        (10)
Remaining surplus             4
There are other arrangements which are worth considering if you have left
planning very late. For elderly people, there are available plans that
enable you to continue to enjoy income, provide you with scope to receive
back your capital while also making a substantial gift now, which could
reduce the inheritance tax charge even if you die the day after making the
gift.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Property: A special place to keep the world at bay - An
Englishman's home is his castle - if he can find one at the right price -
probably in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLAND has so few castles to live in that the benighted English have to
make do with words: 'My home is my castle' - a mythical place where the
world intrudes only by invitation, and the stout-hearted owner pulls up the
drawbridge by switching on the burglar alarm. Or Englishmen build
castellated follies as sentimental substitutes, and dream of kings and
glory.
Why are castles rare, when they are common in Scotland and Ireland, and in
France? Defence and subjugation are the main purpose of these buildings. But
the long era of domestic peace in England meant that there was hardly any
need to build them after the Middle Ages, or to maintain the medieval
castles. They are mostly ruins, while still-used medieval churches stay
spick and span. Instead, the English started building grand country houses,
which did not have fortifications, except by antiquarian whim, but did have
the same economic power as the castles and monasteries.
Across the Channel the French do not live in country houses or have a
translation for the English term. They have chateaux. It is always a
surprise travelling in France how many there are, and that most of them are
basically military. But think of the invasions and evenements France has
suffered - and remember the fate of the nobles in the French Revolution -
and it makes sense to live in a castle or, in the 19th century, to follow
tradition and build a house looking like one.
In Scotland and Ireland the story is similar. Life was uncertain for
centuries. Even when it improved, the tradition, and the memories of 1745
and the Young Pretender or the Irish uprising of 1798 - and the ensuing
repressions by the English - were so alive that castles never disappeared.
Many houses in Scotland began as fortified tower houses, with the main room
on the first floor reached by a spiral staircase, and pepperpot turrets
where the laird's sentry could shoot at the rival clan coming to attack, as
happened often.
In the 19th century Scottish castles became more spacious. The tower-core
had wings added and an extra staircase or two, built in the Scottish
Baronial style which had become a romantic way of showing that Scotland was
separate from England. Mish-mash, enlarged castle houses are the result,
pleasing for the romantic sense of danger they exude.
The spiritual foundations for Scottish castles were tradition and Walter
Scott's stories. With steep roofs and round turrets, these Scottish castles
look like chateaux and reflect the anti-English Auld Alliance of Scotland
and France.
Gardyne Castle, in Angus, eastern Scotland, is a multi-period castle, for
sale from Savills with a guide price of more than Pounds 390,000 (but
needing a thorough redecoration). The Gardyne family built it as a tower in
the 17th century, when they were battling the Guthrie clan. It has three
fine pepperpots and a 'dungeon' connected to the drawing room by an access
hidden in a cupboard. Later additions make it a sympathetic family fortress
with plenty of room.
The walled garden on a south-east facing slope running down to the burn is a
golden opportunity for a serious gardener. It already has a laburnum walk.
The Gulf Stream helps the gardens at Penkill Castle in Ayrshire on the west
side of Scotland, also 16th century and acquired in the 17th century by the
Boyd family, who rebuilt it in the 19th when their friend, Pre-Raphaelite
artist William Bell Scott, painted murals up the staircase to illustrate The
King's Quair, a poem written in 1420 by James I of Scotland when imprisoned
in Windsor Castle. Scott included W A Swinburne as a courtier of Venus, and
himself with Alice Boyd's pet duck. In this century Elton Eckstrand, an
American devotee of the Pre-Raphaelites, bought it and restored it. He has
instructed Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Edinburgh, to sell this chateau
extraordinaire for more than Pounds 300,000.
Kinnaird Castle is gloriously placed, overlooking the Firth of Tay between
Perth and Dundee (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, offers over Pounds 500,000), with a
king's room, prison, doo'cot (dovecot, still working) and a famous alpine
garden. A lonely alternative, unscarred by 19th century Baronial additions,
is Freswick on the Caithness coast in the north of Scotland, offered by
Hamptons at more than Pounds 175,000 and needing work. It is another 16th
century building, incorporating a mediaeval tower and a Viking hall.
For the full 19th century romantic experience, consider Dunselma near Dunoon
in Argyll, built in 1887 by the son of the Coats textile family, and on sale
at more than Pounds 370,000 from Hamptons. In Edinburgh, Peffermill is a
1636 tower house, on sale for only the second time in its 356 years and
sympathetically restored so that it keeps the simplicity - some would say
austerity - that a castle should have. Warriors do not need fitted carpets.
Offers over Pounds 390,000, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
Sundrum Castle, in Ayrshire, dates back to the 14th century, with many
alterations. Now Salopian Estates is converting it into separate houses. The
owners will take a share in the estate company and pay for maintaining the
gardens, woods, park and tennis court. Inquiries to West Highland Estates or
Cluttons.
In England, Clearwell Castle, in Gloucestershire, is an attractive-looking
18th century Gothic concoction with battlements, at present a country house
hotel, which Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hereford offers at over Pounds
750,000. More remarkable is the castle that Sir John Vanbrugh, architect of
Blenheim and Castle Howard, built for himself in Greenwich, south east
London, at the top of Maze Hill. It has been divided into four houses, one
of which is for sale from John D. Wood for around Pounds 400,000 - worth it
for the view across Greenwich Palace to the City of London, let alone the
pleasure of living in Vanbrugh's own house (listed Grade I).
For the same price Humberts is selling the castellated Castle Lodge, at the
foot of the castle mound, at Lewes, Sussex. The castle is now a ruin open to
the public, and not available.
A complete Victorian fort can be bought for Pounds 1m. Fort Corblets, on
Alderney, in the Channel Islands, was built to keep the French in check, and
converted in the 1970s into a family house. It brings the tax haven
advantages of the Channel Islands and overlooks a sandy beach. Agents are
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Swoffers in Guernsey. If you need a castle in
Ireland, Jackson Stops McCabe usually has one or two on its books.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (13): Rising markets will
pull more into the net - Capital gains tax planning / The Inland Revenue
expects increased turnover in stocks and property. Scheherazade Daneshkhu
considers some of the measures that can help to reduce the bill on gains
above the annual exemption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
CAPITAL GAINS tax is not a problem for most people. The number who pay it
has been falling steadily. In the 1992-93 tax year, there were 1.6m
higher-rate taxpayers, but only 85,000 taxpayers faced a bill for CGT,
compared with 155,000 in 1989-90.
The amount of CGT assessed by the Inland Revenue has also been falling, from
Pounds 2.8bn in 1989-90 to Pounds 1.2bn in 1992-93.
The drop was influenced by the relatively poor performance of the stock
market. However, the Inland Revenue expects an increase in turnover in
stocks and property, and estimates that 125,000 taxpayers will be eligible
for CGT in the current tax year. An oddity introduced by the 1993 Finance
Act is that, in some cases, the existence of capital gains can produce an
extra income tax bill as well as a CGT bill.
CGT is charged on gains made when disposing of assets. You are allowed to
make Pounds 5,800 of gains in the current tax year before being liable to
CGT. Some assets, such as your main home, are exempt from CGT.
Measures which reduce the bill on gains above the annual exemption are an
indexation allowance, which gives protection from the effects of post-1982
inflation, and the ability to offset losses against gains.
One investment trust, launched this year by Ivory &amp; Sime, was based on
exploiting the annual CGT exemption. The Isis trust automatically sells 7
per cent each year of an investor's original capital in order to generate a
monthly income plan.
BES and Peps: The Business Expansion Scheme and Personal Equity Plans are
free of CGT. Investors can place Pounds 40,000 in a BES in a single tax year
but the investment must be held for five years for the CGT exemption to
apply. This is the last year of the BES which will be wound up on December
31.
There is no time limit on a Pep but the annual limits are relatively small.
Only a maximum of Pounds 9,000 (via a Pounds 6,000 general and a Pounds
3,000 single company Pep) can be invested in any one tax year.
The drawback with these investments is that if you were unlucky with them,
it would not be possible to offset losses against gains elsewhere.
Bed and Breakfasting: This is the term given to a sale one day and a
purchase the next of shares, to establish either a loss (to offset against
other gains) or to realise gains in order to use up as much as possible of
this year's allowance, since it cannot be carried forward.
The main problem with a bed-and-breakfast deal is that it involves costs,
such as commission and stamp duty, and it carries the risk that prices might
move while you are out of the market.
Bed and breakfasting does not work for 'relevant securities' - those covered
by the accrued-income scheme, deep-discount securities and shares in
non-qualifying offshore funds. Establishing an allowable loss on convertible
loan stock, for example, requires care, because the settlement day for the
re-acquisition must be later than that for the sale.
It is best to consult an accountant about CGT on the sale of non-listed
shares.
Married couples: If you are married (and living together), one way of
lessening the CGT bill in any single tax year is to transfer assets to your
spouse, in order to use his or her annual CGT exemption, or to ensure that
gains are taxed on the spouse with the lower tax rate. The transfer is
usually tax-free, and when the spouse comes to sell the asset it will be
taxed as if they had acquired it at the same price as you paid, broadly
speaking.
Deferring payment or sale of assets: Brian Todd, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says
that, if you are planning to leave the UK for more than one complete tax
year, you should defer the sale of any assets likely to incur a hefty CGT
liability, until after the end of the tax year in which you leave the
country. The assets can then be sold in the next tax year, and there will be
no CGT liability so long as the Inland Revenue regards you as not resident
(and not ordinarily resident) in the UK.
To minimise annual gains, Touche Ross suggests postponing disposals
scheduled for just before the end of the tax year until just after. This
reduces the gains taxable in the current year and delays the date on which
tax becomes payable. The danger is that tax rates may be higher in the next
year.
If you have no gains in one tax year but expect making them in the next,
Maurice Parry-Wingfield, of Touche Ross, suggests realising allowable losses
in the current tax year and carrying them forward to the next year. This
ensures that next year's gain is reduced by next year's annual exemption. If
the loss is realised next year, the gain will be reduced by the loss first,
so that the annual exemption would be wasted.
Full-time directors of unquoted companies, selling shares in their company,
can benefit from a new CGT relief. If they held at least 5 per cent of the
shares for at least one year and, in the last year, had invested (or planned
to invest within three years) in another unquoted company, they may be able
to hold over part of their gain and therefore defer the capital gains. Todd
says that the investor would have to hold at least 5 per cent of the shares
in the new company to qualify for the relief.
James Higgins, of fee-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe, recommends a
number of CGT planning devices for those with sizeable capital gains,
including the use of offshore bonds and 90/10 funds, which hold just under
90 per cent in sterling cash and 10 per cent in other currencies. These
funds can be used to establish an indexed book loss to offset against gains,
but are more effective in times of high inflation.
Higgins says that, in some cases, those with large share holdings in private
companies who wish to transfer assets to children or other members of the
family, may consider the use of a discretionary trust.
The transfer of shares into the trust is regarded as a disposal, and is
therefore liable to CGT. However, hold-over relief applies, whereby you are
effectively passing on the gain to the recipients. There is no capital gains
tax to pay on death, when your assets are instead liable to inheritance tax.
Since Pounds 150,000 of assets can currently be passed on to your heirs free
of inheritance tax, the discretionary trust is one way of getting around the
CGT problem for large shareholdings.
Relevant leaflets from the Inland Revenue are: CGT4 (owner occupied houses),
CGT 6 (retirement relief on disposal of a business), CGT13 (indexation
allowance for quoted shares), CGT 14 (an introduction), CGT15 (a guide for
married couples) and CGT16 (indexation allowance disposals after April 5
1988).

FT  18 SEP 93 / Sport: Beijing may pay for the fast pace - Olympics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANG Junxia's record-breaking feats on the track may just have clipped
Beijing's chances of hosting the 2000 Olympics. The 20-year-old
middle-distance runner pared a huge 16 secs off the women's world 3,000m
record in two separate races at the National Games in Beijing last week.
Yet around the world scepticism, rather than applause, greeted the the news.
The International Amateur Athletics Federation announced it would spend
another Pounds 167,000 on drug-testing next year - most of it in China.
British athletics team manager Joan Allison, an Olympic runner a generation
ago who quit the sport in disgust at Eastern bloc drug-abuse, was
disbelieving.
'You just can't go out and run those times - certainly not at 20. The new
records just can't be taken seriously. I throw my hands back and say 'Here
we go again',' said Allison.
On Thursday night in Monte Carlo the members of the International Olympic
Committee meet to choose between candidate cities for the Millennium Games.
Beijing, with Sydney, is a co-favourite. Already the Olympic elite, with
their precious votes, are talking of little else than Chinese runners.
'To Western eyes, with a sophisticated appreciation of the media, it looks
the crudest and most counter-productive propaganda coup. One could scarcely
credit that the Chinese could be so naive,' said one Olympic 'player' who
has been involved at the highest level for nearly a decade.
However, the adjective most often used by insiders to describe the Beijing
bid is 'brutal'. It is now Chinese policy at the highest level to secure the
Games. It shows in many ways. At the East Asian Games in Shanghai earlier
this year, 1,000 postmen were trained for months to ride illuminated
bicycles into the stadium in the formation of the number 2,000.
Clearly the Beijing mandarins have failed to gauge the sensitivity of the
drugs issue in the Olympic movement. With the Butch Reynolds litigation
hanging over the US Olympic team (the runner claims a drugs-test exclusion
from the team was unlawful) and the spectre of Ben Johnson still too fresh
to be ignored, the elite of the IOC in Lausanne react to even the suspicion
of chemically-induced improvement like a vampire faced with garlic.
There are 91 members of the Committee entitled to participate in the secret
ballot. Probably only 89 will do so. President Juan Antonio Samaranch choses
not to vote and Bulgarian member Ivan Slavkov is not allowed to leave Sofia
by the post-communist regime.
The 1992 games regenerated Barcelona, indeed Spain as a whole. National
self-esteem climbed as international praise flowed and the government said
national GNP was lifted 1 per cent by the Olympics. The five contesting
cities know that 45 ayes could change their nation's history. Beijing has
been letting it known that they have 30-35 votes 'in the bag'. This is
almost certainly an over-estimate but few would doubt that the Asian group
of IOC members are behind China. Even Taiwan's IOC member Ching-Kuo Wu has
pledged his support.
It seems clear that either Berlin or Istanbul will be first to be
eliminated. Berlin has suffered the dreadful handicap of a vociferous - and
potentially dangerous - anti-Games campaign within the city. The safety of
IOC members has been threatened by the 'NOlympics' campaign and graffiti
painted on the walls of the IOC headquarters in Lausanne. Most damagingly of
all, the support of the two German IOC members has seemed at best lukewarm.
Whether Istanbul survives beyond the first ballot - the least-supported bid
is eliminated in each round until there is a clear majority - depends on the
existence of an 'Islamic bloc' within the IOC. Traditionally regional
solidarities have played an influential role in the early stages of voting
but this may be a decreasing phenomenon. While technically adequate, the
Turkish proposal suffers from the lack of a clear identity.
It does not even have the comfort of a compromise role. Should the rival
attractions of Beijing and Sydney, the one geo-political, the other
sybaritic, prove deadlocked. Manchester will probably emerge as the middle
way.
In 1990 the candidature of Britain's foremost northern city was scarcely
credible and it won only five IOC votes. Much has changed in the intervening
four years. Bid chairman Bob Scott has become one of the most persuasive and
popular figures in the Olympic movement. Within his own country he has
charmed Pounds 75m out of John Major's government for infrastructure
beneficial to a 2000 Games.
'I sense that we can win, although I'd be a fool to say that we will,' said
Scott, who will have Major and Olympic gold medallist Linford Christie
flanking him when he makes the final presentation in Monte Carlo.
Australian prime minister Frank Keating will be banging the drum for his
home town, Sydney. The cry for justice which has echoed down the Australia's
past is still in evidence. 'Oceania has had the Games once this century'
(Melbourne in 1956). If the five rings mean anything then it must be our
turn,' said spokesman Hamish Fraser.

SAM Torrance, the roguish Scot, was trying to explain to David Feherty, the
irreverent Irishman, the special tensions attached to playing in a Ryder Cup
match.
'It's like having a baby,' said Torrance finally. 'Until you've become a
father, you don't know what it's like. You can read all the books, take all
the advice anyone wants to give you but you have to experience it for
yourself to know what it's really like.'
Later this month, at the Belfry, Torrance will be experiencing the thrill -
and the fear - for the seventh consecutive time while Feherty will be biting
his nails on the sidelines. He coped well on his debut at Kiawah Island two
years ago (beating Payne Stewart, the US Open champion, in the singles) but
failed to make the team this year.
Torrance has won numerous individual titles, including three this season,
but he said nothing matched striding up the 18th fairway at the Belfry in
1985 knowing it was in his hands to win the Ryder Cup. 'In a tournament,
you're only letting yourself down if you blow it. That's the big difference,
having other people relying on you. It's very special.'
That was demonstrated for the whole world at Kiawah last time, when Bernhard
Langer had a putt of a few feet to beat Hale Irwin and retain the Cup.
Langer missed and the agony or the ecstasy was written on every face. The
emotions might have been similar if Langer had had that putt to win the
Masters or the Open Championship but they would not have been felt so
universally or so intensely.
Feherty called it the 'high temple of stress' and Irwin, three times US Open
champion and a man who thought he was used to tense situations, admitted he
could barely breathe as he played the last hole, so crushing was the
pressure.
Tom Watson, captain of the US side this year, was not at Kiawah but said,
'Just watching it on television was worse than the pressure of winning an
Open.' And Watson won the Open five times and the US Open once. Everyone
sympathised with Langer, specially Irwin, who had suffered with him in the
cauldron, and admitted, 'There is no way that I would ever wish what
happened on the last hole to happen to anyone.'
It was the sort of thing that might have ruined a career but Langer proved
that he is blessed with an iron will and an admirable sense of perspective
when he won the German Masters the following week. Bernard Gallacher,
Europe's captain then and now, was full of admiration. 'Extraordinary,' he
said. 'Such maturity. Such resilience. I might ask Bernhard to play last
again,' he added, 'and I think he'd accept the position.'
There is no doubt that Langer would. Earlier this year, he was asked if he
would be happy to face a similar putt, in a similar situation, at the
Belfry. 'Yes,' was his answer, given without an instant's hesitation. Fred
Couples, the former US Masters champion, asked the same question, also said,
'Yes,' but only after a long pause and without anything like Langer's
conviction. Yet he could only imagine how hard it would be. Langer knew.
Watson, who has played on four Ryder Cup teams, has no doubts that the
competition is 'a top ticket event, a major if you like.' He reiterated his
view that it is, in some respects, more major than the majors. 'There is no
question that the pressure of playing in the Ryder Cup is greater than that
you experience in a major championship. You are testing the human bottle,
the human spirit, the human capability to its utmost.'
Winning the Cup is relatively straightforward: you just collect more points
than the other lot (although in the Americans' case, a tie would allow them
to retain the trophy). All the passion, all the effort, all the blood, sweat
and tears boil down to a simple set of figures, figures that will be there
for ever, indicating no more than who won and who lost, taking no account of
how close things were or how the luck ran. That is another thing that makes
the Ryder Cup so tough and so special. It is all or nothing. There is no
place to hide.
Harry Vardon, who won the Open Championship six times, once said: 'For this
game you need, above all things, to be in a tranquil frame of mind.' Vardon,
however, never played in a Ryder Cup.

</HEADLINE>

ANYONE who followed the campaign leading to the choice of Atlanta for the
1996 Games knows Charlie Battle. The Georgia lawyer was the General Patton
of the charm offensive. Anywhere an IOC member could be found, Charlie was
alongside them.
Now Battle is executive vice-president of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games. He is uniquely placed to comment on how the candidates play
the endgame in Monaco next week - and it is worth remembering that Atlanta
was never favourite to win the 1990 vote in Tokyo.
He thinks cities are mistaken in paying too much attention to atlases. 'I've
never believed too much in the 'bloc' vote,' said Battle. 'The ballot is the
one area where an IOC member can do exactly what they want to.
'They can ignore what their government wants and what their sport wants them
to do. You should never forget that in that secret moment they vote from the
heart.
'And even now there is still everything to play for. The last few days can
be critical. Keep working on the one-on-one relationships and then confirm
your whole vision in the presentation.'
Opinions differ on the value of the final brief presentation to the full
IOC. Some say that votes are already decided, others that it is the crux of
the entire three-year effort.
'I don't think you can win on your presentation but you definitely lose
existing support,' said Battle.
'By the time Tokyo came around our bid was really running short of funds and
we had to put together a very basic presentation which relied almost
entirely on the personal appeal of Billy Payne (the Atlanta chairman) and
Andrew Young.
'You can't just get up and blow them away with some bang-up show you've
rehearsed for seven months. Each of the 91 people will react differently.'
Keep to the course previously set and maintain that personal contact right
up to the eleventh hour and the 59th minute, is the Battle advice. 'It ain't
over until until it's over,' he adds.
'I still don't know to this day exactly why we won,' Battle said. 'The
beauty of this whole game is that it's such a spectacular exercise in
conjecture and speculation.'

FT  18 SEP 93 / Sport: Cathedrals of the game - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the pressing questions early in each soccer season is how well clubs
have spent their money over the summer. Usually, this means casting a
critical eye over the talent on the field - but not this season. Roy Keane
may have cost a record fee. But while Manchester United paid Pounds 3.75m
for him they spent Pounds 10m modernising the Stretford End of Old Trafford.
United were not alone. Before the season started a friend phoned to report
that he had already been to Highbury, just to inspect the new Pounds 22m
North Bank stand.
There comes a point for fans when their obsession with soccer spreads beyond
the game and embraces the stadia in which it is played. Sports arenas are
often casually referred to as cathedrals. But for soccer fans the place
where they have performed their weekly ritual of torment and euphoria does
take on a superstitious aura.
This obsession manifests itself in different ways. Fans go to the ground in
the off season to watch paint dry. On the other hand Millwall fans, faced
with the prospect of a move to spanking-new Senegal Fields, marked the last
match at their ramshackle slum on Cold Blow Lane by pelting the club's
directors with abuse and turf.
Whenever fans gather, conversation turns to stadia. Part of the reason is
pragmatic: is there a good Balti restaurant near Villa Park? How can you get
away from Upton Park without being beaten up? But there is something more:
what is a ground like as a place to perform the Saturday ritual? Talk turns
to the architecture and the atmosphere.
A strange new book, The Aerofilms Guide To Football Grounds, (Dial, Pounds
9.99) attempts to answer the practical questions. Like so much that is sold
to the English soccer fan it opts to offer too little rather than too much;
it works best as an illustrated companion to Simon Inglis' wonderful,
eccentric Football Grounds of Great Britain (Willow, Pounds 9.95).
In the Aerofilms book, each club's entry contains sparse information. The
interest is in the two aerial views of each ground. One taken from a great
height, is plastered with helpful yellow code. Arrows point into the
distance. 'Oxford BR Station 3 miles' reads one useful caption. A letter 'T'
shows toilets for visiting fans (only ever one it seems). Anything which
encourages fans to use the urinals is a good thing. But there is not a word
to explain the question that is raised by nearly all the splendid
oblique-angle aerial close-ups: why is the ground that shape?
One after another there are asymmetrical grounds (Barnet, Birmingham,
Bradford, Brighton, Bristol Rovers) and stands with strange kinks
(Blackburn, Bolton and so on). Hardly an English ground is an architectural
whole. Everywhere there are gleaming new stand roofs next to aged brown
expanses of terracing. Everywhere the spy plane flew the builders were in,
as clubs raced towards the deadline for all-seater grounds.
The pictures of Highbury, Elland Road and Old Trafford show building sites.
What good to the fan is a picture of a hole where there is now a stand? But
as a historical document of a game in a period of rebuilding the book is
excellent.
It is also highly suggestive. Here are the newly-built Bescot Stadium,
Walsall, and Senegal Fields sitting in their freshly-cleared urban
wastelands, surrounded by the little yellow boxes of generous parking
facilities.
Here is Old Trafford, the shape of big grounds to come, rebuilt into a huge,
symmetrical donut, but pictured with a large bite - the Stretford End -
missing. It still has room to breathe and expand. Here is White Hart Lane
hemmed on three sides by roads. One of its old assets, its compactness,
cramps the potential capacity of an all-seater stadium.
Tottenham are planning a development that will make the ground look rather
like Old Trafford, with a single sweeping, curving roof. But where Old
Trafford holds 45,000, White Hart Lane's capacity, even when the development
is finished and every corner crammed with seats, will be 40,000 at the most.
How will Spurs compete financially with United if they sell 5,000 fewer
tickets for every home game?
At least Spurs do not have the problems of Chelsea. The aerial picture of
Stamford Bridge offers a condensed history not just of a soccer club but of
England itself over the last 20 years.
The Bridge was one of the few English grounds built to the Continental oval
model. A dog track separated the fans from the action. In 1972, after
winning the FA Cup and the European Cup winners cup, the club started the
redevelopment they hoped would cement their place in the game's elite. It
began with the magnificent East stand which perches close to the pitch
towering over the rest of the ground. Here John Major, Norman Lamont and
David Mellor, sit in luxury in their royal blue seats, to watch their
soccer.
The stand almost bankrupted the club. The Mears family, Chelsea's founders,
sold out to brassy Ken Bates, the lease passed into and out of the hands of
property speculators, the club slipped into the second division and
abandoned redevelopment. The fans have had to finance the debt through high
ticket prices.
In the aerial picture the contrast is clear. Next to the great stand sits
the Shed: a small roof over a large expanse of terracing which can hold
10,000 standing fans. Part of it closed, marked off by a snaking blue
barrier, in one corner stands the remains of a floodlight pylon. The Shed is
separated from the action by a great bow of grass and the wide sweep of the
unused track. At Spurs, fans in two stands can reach out and touch a player
taking a corner. A Sheddite would have trouble hitting him with a hurled
brick.
Here is proof that environment and behaviour are linked. Stamford Bridge
was, and according to a recent police report, remains, the home of the
nastiest fans in English soccer; the lumpen proletariat outside the palace.
Now it is threatened by the club's planned Pounds 36m redevelopment. No
doubt fans will protest. They will have a point. The Shed is part of English
soccer's history. Someone should slap a preservation order on it. Mind you,
I will never stand in it again.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A blow to the G and T set - Giles MacDonogh
thinks gin drinkers have cause for concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE course of the past year or so, I have begun to feel sorry for the gin
and tonic drinker. I realise that the manufacturers of his favourite drink
do not think much of him and feel they can slip water into his gin without
him noticing - except that a few people did notice.
When I learned that Gordon's had reduced the alcoholic strength of its UK
bottlings from 40 per cent alcohol by volume to 37.5 I called a gin and
tonic drinking friend and asked him his reaction: 'Dear boy', he said, 'I
poured myself my usual sundowner and had a snort and then I said to myself
'something's wrong]' At this point I looked at the label and suddenly the
mystery was solved.'
Gordon's controls about half the UK market for gin so when it sneezes all
the other companies catch cold. In the wake of Gordon's' decision, one by
one they all followed suit, with the exception of Burroughs' Beefeater which
remains at 40 per cent. Beefeater is now being punished for its
stubbornness, for the other brands have made around 50p a bottle out of this
move, or if you prefer: Pounds 6 a case.
Gordon's latest move is to remove the mention 'the heart of a good cocktail'
from the label. It was right to do so: at 37.5 per cent it was certainly
untrue.
I have it on no less an authority than the head barman of the Palace Hotel,
in Madrid, that it is quite impossible to make a decent dry Martini with
less than 47 per cent; and he used to make Martinis for Ernest Hemingway, a
man who knew a thing or two about drinking.
Gordon's has been able to get away with all this because gin is basically a
non-drink. Anything which is really worth drinking must be drinkable on its
own: neat, or as near as dammit.
Few people, however, drink gin by itself, or even with a splash of water:
the odd Oxford don and the totality of gin distillers. I cannot even think
of a handful of others.
In this country gin and tonic drinkers account for 70 per cent of the people
who buy gin. When I spoke to the distillers at Gilbey's Gin a few years
back, they told me that they even tasted the gin with tonic to see how the
product blended up with the tonic water from Schweppes.
I think I must enjoy about one gin and tonic a year: on a perfect, English,
summer evening (there have not been many of these this year) when care has
been taken to put the lime, the tonic, the gin and the glass in the fridge;
then, and only then is it a refreshing aperitif. The pub gin and tonic has
to be classed as one of the most disgusting concoctions known to drinking
man.
The US uses gin more inventively than we do, and this is borne out by the
fact that the gin distillers have not tampered with the strengths of gin on
the American market: Plymouth is still at 40 per cent, Gordon's is at 43 per
cent and Beefeater at a cocktail strength of 47 per cent, to name but three.
The reason for this is abundantly clear: Americans use gin to make cocktails
they do not drown it with tonic water.
There was one respectable way of drinking gin in this country but these days
it is rarely seen outside naval circles. That was the pink gin. You swilled
a little angostura bitters around a glass and then tossed them out. Then you
added gin and topped up with a little water. The result had the palest pink
tinge.
The favourite gin for making pink gins was Plymouth. Being so close to the
dockyards in the great port, naval officers developed a loyalty to Plymouth
gin which they never lost.
Plymouth gin also had a slightly different character in that the chief
'botanical' constituent (or flavouring, if you prefer) was orris, or iris,
root. Gordon's is perhaps the most juniperry of gins.
All the other main brands have opted for the London Dry formula which relies
far more on citrus character. This derives not only from the use of orange
and/or lemon peel as a botanical, coriander is also a vital ingredient for
making London Dry. Beefeater also stresses the importance of the highly
aromatic angelica root.
Gordon's has been making a big effort lately to explain to drinks writers
that strength is not important: 'Alcohol is just a vehicle for carrying
flavours', it says.
It denies that the winetaster's term 'mouthfeel' has any importance when it
comes to gin. This may be true in a gin and tonic, where the result of
Gordon's decision to water its gin will mean simply that you will have to be
more sparing with the tonic, but it is simply nonsense in the case of a dry
cocktail.
My advice to gin drinkers is the following: if you drink gin and tonic buy
Beefeater; if you make cocktails buy Tanqueray at 47.3 per cent, the only
generally available high-strength gin on the UK market; if you do not like
the strong juniper-character of Tanqueray you must bring back your favourite
brand at 47 per cent the next time you go abroad; or, if you are anywhere
near Plymouth you could drop into the distillery shop and buy a bicentennial
distillation at 57 per cent. Do not bother with tonic, drink it pink.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: How to deal with a sleeping partner - Clients
who fall asleep pose a real challenge for a restaurateur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME YEARS ago when I was running a London restaurant, I read an article
that had a very big influence in my attitude to customers.
It was not written for the trade by a fellow restaurateur, nor did it appear
in a specialist catering magazine. It was written for Vogue by Christopher
Matthew, a perceptive and unbiased amateur, under the headline WIC
These initials, Matthew noted, stood for the conversation that so frequently
takes place between couples on their way to their chosen restaurant which
can, as I learnt only too quickly, affect their mood from the moment they
walk in and, ultimately, their enjoyment of the meal.
Such 'Words In Car' may range from: 'If you hadn't bothered to take that
phone call we would have been there by now' to 'Why didn't you park there? I
am sure you could have squeezed in' or, most ominously, 'What on earth made
you book a table here?'
Yes, Matthew is absolutely right: so many things outside a restaurant's
control can ruin a meal. For example, it may be very difficult to please
diners who are still feeling the disappointment of a bad performance at the
theatre. Still worse are the occasions when a company has to entertain
overseas clients who have pulled out of a deal at the last minute.
Retirement dinners, especially for someone taking early retirement - and
taking it reluctantly - may be the most difficult of all.
But in the best restaurants, such situations can be salvaged. Just as a
thoughtful maitre d' remembers his regular customers' aperitif, so the swift
delivery of the menu and wine list to an unhappy looking table can help
matters. A word too to the kitchen to ensure that a potentially difficult
table's order is dealt with promptly shows the same concern. As does a word
of warning to a young commis waiter to steer clear and not aggravate
matters.
But during the summer I witnessed for the second time in a top restaurant a
scenario that can unnerve even the best-drilled waiting staff and provides a
set of initials to rival Matthew's WIC Mine are ZAT - Zzzz's At Table'. What
do you do when a diner falls asleep?
The first time I spotted this phenomenon was at a two-star Michelin
restaurant in London's West End. In spite of the attractions of the food,
wine and company my attention was suddenly distracted by what was happening
at a table across the room at which the woman seemed to be physically
propping up the man.
I was riveted. The snoozing diner was young, in his early 30s and dressed in
a pin-striped suit. Every few minutes he would lean forward over his plate
and doze off. His companion, unhappy with his behaviour - particularly as,
five years ago, they would have had to reserve their table some weeks in
advance - kept shaking, prodding and pushing him in an attempt to wake him.
All to little effect. The waiting staff sadly offered no help, pretending to
ignore him and to keep away from the table, only interfering when it seemed
that some damage might be done to restaurant property. There was no
alternative. She called for the bill and escorted him out.
I thought this just an isolated episode until this summer when in a
restaurant in France we were seated across from a table of four Japanese.
They seemed quite relaxed, with an empty bottle of white wine by their table
and their first course finished. No sooner, however, had the main courses
been served than one of the men began to sway tellingly over his dish.
Within minutes he was deeply asleep.
Cultural differences in how to treat the sleeping diner were soon obvious.
His three fellow diners made no attempt to rouse him but continued their
meal without paying him the slightest attention.
When they had finished their main course the waiters cleared the plates
without making any reference to the untouched dish. By the time they
returned with the desserts the sleeping diner had awoken and, greatly
refreshed, devoured his food and ordered an espresso coffee.
There are obvious explanations: jet-lag, over-indulgence, ill-health,
fatigue or boredom, which many readers may have experienced themselves and
sympathise with. So far this phenomenon seems to only affected men in
expensive restaurants. But it has left two otherwise highly professional
sets of waiting staff lost for the appropriate response. For the concerned
restaurateur the case of the sleeping diner presents a new set of challenges
in customer care.
I would be delighted to hear from any reader who has an ingenious solution
or can tell me of a similar experience. I will reward the best reply with a
bottle of pink champagne.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The fruits of Rioja - Common Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOGRONO is the urban hub of the Rioja region of Spain, best known for its
wines. Apart from a few streets which radiate from the central square by the
cathedral, Logrono is not a very attractive place: much has been rebuilt in
the post-Franco years and now the impression one gets is of mile-upon-mile
of shabby flats.
The market is no longer in the square. It was long ago transferred to a
covered building a few streets away. At the back of this runs the Calle del
Laurel, the city's most lively street after dark, where all the tapas bars
appear to be.
Rioja is near enough to the coast to be interesting for fish and close
enough to the cool mountains to be regularly supplied with pork (the pig is
naturally the king of the domestic beasts in the limited space given to a
mountain farm) and cheese. The plains of Rioja Baja also provide vegetables:
not just the famous white asparagus of Rioja and Navarre, but all those
vegetables which are constituent parts of the local menestra de verduras:
artichokes, potatoes, cardoons, peas and green beans.
In August Logrono market had few vegetable rarities to offer, but one thing
did catch my eye: borraja or borage, in England used only as a dressing for
summer Pimms, but in Spain the tender young shoots are cooked with potatoes
as a first course. The rest was more predictable: white beans, green
chillies, Swiss chard and heaps of oyster mushrooms. The strangest fruits
were the tiny pears and miniature flat-ended peaches called paraguayos.
There was no absence of fish from the market stalls. As one might expect
there was a lot of hake (the national fish), sea bass, sea bream, bonito and
monkfish. Perhaps more interesting was the grading accorded to dried cod in
the market: the best bacalao came from the Faroe Islands, those from Iceland
and Norway were markedly cheaper.
These piscine offerings notwithstanding, from all the evidence of the
market, the people of Logrono must be tremendous meat eaters. In a
restaurant the previous night there had been a great many jokes about
vegetarians. I asked if there were any vegetarians in Spain. My hosts became
thoughtful. Finally, they suggested, but were not certain, that the Queen
was a vegetarian, and left it at that.
There were no vegetarians in the place I visited first that morning: the
chorizo factory just outside Logrono which belongs to the Palacios family.
Here they produce chiefly chorizos of the thin, horseshoe-shaped variety;
fairly mild sausages without the hefty dose of pimenton one might expect in
the south of Spain. Palacios told me that many chorizos were getting milder
because children did not like hot foods.
Palacios also makes salchichon, which are mild and made without pimenton;
and papadas: pigs' cheeks seasoned with pimenton, salt and garlic.
Pigs' bits were also one of the market's major themes: black puddings from
Burgos or Rioja; butifara sausages from Catalonia; fresh chorizos for frying
or adding to bean or chick pea stews; chitterlings; cracked up pieces of
roasted pigs' heads; pigs' snouts; slightly ropey bits of highly priced
Jabugo ham, but these were not from here - they had been airlifted from
Seville.
It was not all pork, however, embuchados de cabrito seemed to be little
balls of kids' guts. Smiling suckling pigs were arranged alongside sheeps'
heads, tiny lamb trotters and calves' ears.
The earthy quality of the food available from the market strongly contrasts
with that offered by the best restaurants in the region. Meson Chuchi in
Fuenmayor specialises in meat cooked in a baker's oven: suckling pig, milk
fed lamb and kid. It looks a bit like a medieval torture chamber with its
pseudo-gothic vaults and iron grilles, but quality is good.
The best restaurant in Rioja is in Logrono itself at La Merced, in the old
heart of the city. Here you will eat the best food of the region: gamba
croquettes on the finest tomato sauce; lobster salad; braised oxtails
pimientos rellenos, or stuffed pimentos; or squid cooked in its own ink. All
these dishes will be moistened with good Rioja wine.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: If you're ready, Oysters dear . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN R in the month marks the official return of native oysters, wild scallops
and mussels to our menus. Oysters are classically served raw and are so
delicious that way that it seems a mite foolish for the cook to devote any
time to them. I would rather conserve my energy for cooking other things.
Mussels invite far greater variety of kitchen treatments. Just think of
soups like moules mariniere, mouclade and our own mussel brose for a start.
The only trouble about mussels is the time it takes to clean them. Reluctant
to dally in the kitchen I shall save mussels for darker days when the appeal
of lingering in the warmth of the kitchen soars.
And so to scallops, which more often than not come ready cleaned by the
fishmonger and which need little cooking. Scallops, like oysters, are of
course exquisite to eat raw when beautifully fresh, with a squeeze of lemon
or lime and perhaps a light scattering of chervil, or plain and simple just
as they are.
That is the way I gobbled my way through dozens of little queen scallops at
John Noble's Loch Fyne Oyster Bar at Cairndow (there are branches in
Nottingham and at Elton, near Peterborough). Marvellously tender and sweet
they were with a briny whiff of the sea.
Unless, however, the weather is truly brilliant, hot scallops may seem more
appealing, in the evenings at least. Here is a timely way to serve them.
GRILLED SCALLOPS WITH RED PEPPERS, TOMATOES &amp; BASIL
A main course for 2-3 or a generous appetiser for 4, in which case I would
serve the colourful mixture in (real or china) scallop shells. The peppers
and tomatoes can be prepared ahead for the sake of convenience, but allow
time to reheat them in the oven before grilling the scallops.
Six fine fresh scallops (enough to yield  1/2 lb or so of flesh); two red
peppers;  1/2 lb cherry tomatoes; a small bunch of basil; a sliver of
garlic;  1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds; three tablespoons extra virgin
olive oil; wedges of lemon and good bread for serving.
Core the peppers, quarter them or cut them into strips as necessary to lay
them flat, and wipe away the seeds. Cook them, skin side up, under a hot
grill until the flesh feels soft and the skin is blistered and black.
While the peppers are grilling, pour boiling water over the tomatoes. Leave
for one minute then drain and slip off the skins.
Cover the cooked peppers with a cloth (to keep the steam in) until cool
enough to handle. Then strip off the skins and cut the flesh into chunks.
Put the peppers into a warmed dish, add the tomatoes and mix gently.
Crush the garlic and pound the coriander seeds to a coarse powder. Put the
flavourings into a small pan with 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil. Warm gently
until sizzling then pour the aromatic mixture over the vegetables. Swirl to
mix and season with sea salt and black pepper. Cover the dish and slip it
into an oven heated to 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4 while dealing with the
scallops.
Gently separate the corals from the whites and slice each white across into
two rounds. Lay them on a sturdy baking tray. Season them with sea salt and
a grinding of pepper and dribble the remaining  1/2 tablespoon of olive oil
over them. Turn them to coat them all over and slip the tray under the grill
at a little distance from the flame. Grill, turning once, until the corals
firm up and the whites turn from glassy looking to pearly. One minute on
each side is probably plenty.
Tip the contents of the scallop pan on to the vegetables and mix gently,
adding a generous scattering of torn basil leaves. Serve with wedges of
lemon and plenty of bread to mop up the fragrant juices.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (12): Look ahead on
interest rates - Tax-efficient investments 4, National Savings /
Certificates are the most suitable product for higher-rate taxpayers, says
Scheherazade Daneshkhu. But investors need to plan over a five-year period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL SAVINGS products have at least two things in their favour. One is
the tax-free return that some of them offer; the other is security - the
government is the safest institution you could invest in.
If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, the most suitable investments are the
certificates. These are free of both income and capital gains tax, but you
have to hold on to them for five years to obtain the full return, and they
pay no income.
The rates on the certificates are fixed, so the main concern if you are
thinking of buying now is where you think interest rates will be over the
five-year period. The latest issues pay considerably less than last year
when bank base rates were higher. For example, it was only just over a year
ago, that the 37th issue certificates were offering a guaranteed return of 8
per cent a yearcompound if held for five years, compared with 5.75 per cent
today.
If you think base rates will rise significantly within the next five years,
this may not be the best time to lock your money away for a fixed return.
But if you think base rates will fall as low as 4 per cent by the end of the
year, as some economists have predicted, and will continue to remain low for
several years, these may be the highest rates on offer for a while.
The minimum investment in either the savings or the index-linked
certificates has recently been raised from Pounds 25 to Pounds 100;
purchases above the minimum are in units of Pounds 25. The maximum
investment in either is Pounds 10,000, although an additional Pounds 10,000
can be reinvested from matured certificates of earlier issues. If you forget
to cash in the savings certificates and do not reinvest them, they will
continue to attract interest but at a much lower rate. The general extension
rate is currently 3.75 per cent a year.
Savings certificates: The current 40th issue pays a guaranteed return of
5.75 per cent a year compound if held for five years. The return is the
equivalent of 9.58 per cent to a 40 per cent taxpayer (7.67 per cent to a
lower-rate taxpayer).
Index-linked certificates: These pay 3.25 per cent a year above the rate of
inflation, measured by the retail prices index. It is possible to hold both
these and the 40th issue certificates, but if you wish to choose between the
two, you have to decide where you expect the inflation rate to be within the
next five years. If you think it will be above 2.5 per cent a year, then
index-linked certificates are going to offer the higher returns.
(Those with a gambling instinct could buy premium bonds. The prize fund is
calculated at 5 per cent on all eligible bonds and the prizes are tax-free.
There are over 160,000 prizes of between Pounds 50-Pounds 250,000 a month.
The minimum investment has also been raised to Pounds 100, and the maximum
is Pounds 20,000.)
Capital bonds: The most suitable product for non-taxpayers are the Capital
Bonds which also offer a guaranteed return if held for five years. They are
subject to tax but non-taxpayers will have the benefit of receiving interest
gross, because the return comes in the form of a capital gain at repayment.
Basic-rate taxpayers will face a tax bill on their accrued 'interest' each
year, although they do not actually receive the return until the five years
are up.
The present Series G offers a gross return of 7.75 per cent a year, compound
over five years. The bonds are sold in multiples of Pounds 100, to a maximum
of Pounds 250,000.
Income bonds: The main NS product which delivers an income is the income
bond. Once again, interest is taxable but tax is not deducted at source -
making bonds suitable for non-taxpayers. National Savings has recently made
income bonds more attractive by adding a differential rate which is higher
for larger investors. Rates are variable.
Balances under Pounds 25,000 attract an interest rate of 7 per cent a year
gross, while that paid on amounts above this is 7.25 per cent gross. The
minimum investment is Pounds 2,000, the maximum Pounds 250,000.
Children: Parents who transfer money to their children usually have to pay
tax on the income. NS offers a tax-free savings route with its Children's
Bonus Bond. Issue E pays a guaranteed return equal to 7.85 per cent a year
when held for five years.
Unfortunately, only a maximum of Pounds 1,000 can be invested in this way;
the minimum is Pounds 25. Adults have to purchase the bond for children
under the age of 16, and there are no more returns after the 21st birthday.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Travel: Paradise of birds - In Hauraki Gulf, off Auckland,
Michael J Woods visits islands being returned to nature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRANGE green blob on the green screen had been bothering Warwick Murray
for some time. Then we burst through the dense grey curtain of fog into a
few acres of sunshine gleaming on the bright sea. And there was our green
blip - a large container ship, a sheer steel cliff, foghorn bawling,
plugging gently through the water.
Warwick eased back the throttles and the inflatable settled sluggishly in
the water and stopped almost on the spot. We had barely skirted the vessel
when we were enveloped by fog once more. Now a much longer green line showed
on the boat's radar screen - a line of islands. We were almost upon it and
already in radio contact with Ray Walter, the resident warden, when the mist
cleared abruptly and a steep green hillside reared up in front of us, topped
by a red-and-white lighthouse.
We motored gently to the end of the wooden pier and climbed on to the island
of Tiritiri Matangi, just one of some 47 islands in Hauraki Gulf maritime
park, directly off Auckland, New Zealand.
Few big cities have such beautiful areas of wilderness as close to their
centre and as directly accessible as Auckland does. While Tiritiri Matangi
is not quite as easy as some of the islands to reach, it is an open
sanctuary and has been at the centre of an initiative by the Department of
Conservation over the past decade to preserve native wildlife.
When New Zealand originally split from the ancient super-continent of
Gondwanaland, it possessed only two mammal species, both of them bats, so
its wildlife was able to develop without fear of ground predators. An array
of flightless birds such as the kiwi, and a large green ground parrot called
the kakapo, emerged.
Although Tiritiri remained free of predators, pastoral farming reduced the
original native forest cover to scattered remnants in a few steep gullies:
too small to support indigenous wildlife. But once acquired by the DoC,
agriculture ceased and re-afforestation began.
A range of organisations - sports clubs, schools, youth organisations,
walking groups - volunteered to visit the island and plant young trees. Over
the past nine years, more than 200,000 saplings have been planted and
already the 550-acre island is reverting to natural bush, enabling many
threatened native birds to be re-introduced.
Along the shore I found breeding boxes for blue penguins and, by opening the
trap doors in the roofs and peering through the grubby glass ceilings, I
could see the small but chubby silvery birds within. A board-walk nature
trail leads to the top of the island past a small pond containing a pair of
brown teal, the fourth most endangered water fowl in the world. From thick
shrubs I heard the warbling notes of tuis, or parson birds, and spotted
several saddlebacks picking through the leaf litter.
The DoC has already brought a number of bird species to the island. I came
across the feeding holes left by the long slender beaks of the nocturnal
little spotted kiwi and saw several brilliantly-plumaged takahes courting.
I followed another board-walk back to the boat, winding through a remnant of
natural bush, dense dark woodland dominated by huge sprawling pohutakawa
trees with tatty bark. In the gloom we saw one of the 24 rare North Island
robins imported to the island a year ago.
Buoyed by its success on Tiritiri Matangi, the DoC is about to undertake a
much more ambitious scheme in the gulf, the replanting of the island of
Motutapu. Motutapu and the neighbouring island of Rangitoto are connected by
a short causeway. It is hard to believe that two islands so closely linked
could be so different.
The 3,750 acres of Motutapu are green farmland, full of echoes of the Dorset
countryside: steep dells, wonderful views and a nearby sea. Rangitoto might
as well be the moon, for it is an island of lumps of tumbled black basalt,
great bare deserts, touched and crusted here and there by a few daring,
flaky grey lichens and the occasional bold moss.
But small areas of woodland are becoming established, the tree limbs hairy
with lichens. Rangitoto is a mere 600 years old - a volcano which last
erupted 200 years ago - and its colonisation is of international interest.
It is a favourite destination of Aucklanders, with a regular boat service
from the city. Runners trot up to its 800-ft summit, and Sunday walkers
enjoy its paths and the magnificent views from the top where the crater is
now thick with native bush.
From here the vehicular track led me down to the causeway which I crossed to
wander over Motutapu's green acres, enriched by the fertile ash erupted from
its neighbour, before returning along the shore path to the ferry landing on
Rangitoto.
The unfamiliar evergreen trees overhanging the water have a strange
resemblance to the gnarled and twisted oaks on the north-west coast of
Scotland, and this similarity was reinforced by the fluting call of a
blackbird whose predecessors were brought here by acclimatisation societies
in order to make new immigrants feel more at home.
The DoC's project to replant Motutapu is not only ambitious in terms of
size. There are other problems to be overcome. Introduced herbivores -
possums and wallabies - confined to the wild areas by farming operations had
almost destroyed the natural vegetation both there and on Rangitoto. So
helicopters were used to spread over Rangitoto a poisoned bait palatable to
mammals but not to birds. The work is continuing, but the number of feral
animals has been greatly reduced and native tree species are showing
promising signs of recovery.
From the summit of Motutapu it is possible to see right down the gulf and
pick out the distant form of Tiritiri. Its prefabricated lighthouse was made
in London last century and carried to the island in sections by ship - one
of the better things exported from Britain to New Zealand.
Rangitoto and Motutapu are accessible from Auckland. The visitor centre
(tel: 09-366-6888) has details of all services, but Fullers Rangitoto
Ferries (09-771-771) provides the most frequent service. Check times of
return ferries as alternative transport is expensive.
Tiritiri Matangi can be reached by a twice-weekly ferry in the summer. The
DoC in Auckland will help (09-307-9279). You can stay in the bunkhouse on
the island, though you need to take your own food and bedding (09-479-4490).

FT  18 SEP 93 / Travel: Violent landscape in bubbling repose - Michael J
Woods flies above the volcanoes of Rotorua, climbs into their craters and
bathes in their sulphur springs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOT sulphurous steam belched from the mountainside and rose in stifling
clouds from the main crater, rolling upwards towards the rim before being
torn to shreds and melting away to invisibility in the powerful
south-westerly wind.
The helicopter, insignificant against this great mountain, banked over the
crater, bucking in the uplift. As it did so I stared into the volcano's evil
depths to glimpse the sump of viscous grey liquid in the bottom. Only the
bilious yellow of sulphur coloured the moonscape. Like iodine around a
wound, the sulphur had left a saffron deposit round every vent and crack.
The helicopter landed on the slippery surface of the old mudflow, deeply
scored by water channels, where the wind piled in from the sea between two
cliffs. This was White Island, an active volcano 31 miles off the east coast
of New Zealand's North Island. Fishing boats may shelter in its lee and
gannets and mutton birds may nest on its outer edges, but the interior is
far less hospitable - the living planet in the making.
White Island is at one end of a volcanic region which stretches inland
south-west to Ruapehu volcano, 150 miles away, and contains all New
Zealand's historically active volcanoes. One of its most notable
manifestations is Mount Tarawera which erupted in the early morning of June
10 1886 to cause New Zealand's biggest natural disaster.
We flew over it on our return from White Island, looking down into a
gigantic cleft 850ft deep, blasted out of the mountain's three-domed summit
in a rift eruption which runs for more than 10 miles.
While a helicopter ride gives you a good overview, nothing beats climbing
down into the crater, so later I was driven close to the top before
slip-sliding down a long, steep scree slope into the crater itself.
Stand still and the silence is almost overwhelming.
But the earth has not finished its business here. Although my guide
repeatedly reminded me that the giant beneath Tarawera was only sleeping,
there was no sign of geothermal life. Go down the hill to the south-west and
cross Lake Rotomahana into Waimangu Valley and there is enough activity to
satisfy the most ardent enthusiast. And it would be harder to find one more
ardent than Bradley Scott, from the volcano surveillance team of New
Zealand's Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences, who took me there.
He regularly monitors temperatures and water levels of the two lakes, Frying
Pan Lake and Inferno Crater Lake. As they gently steamed before us, he
explained that the two swap water via a freak underground chamber from which
it is forced as if from a subterranean pressure cooker.
Over a 38-day cycle, the level of Inferno Crater Lake can vary by as much as
39 feet, by far the largest such fluctuation in the world. By keeping an eye
on things here, Brad should be able to predict any further eruptions and
avoid the surprise that Tarawera sprung just over a century ago. In volcanic
terms that was a minor eruption. Far larger ones have taken place here in
the past, throwing out huge amounts of molten rock.
Tourism based on hydrothermal activity was already growing before the 1886
eruption. Displays in Rotorua museum, located in a failed
turn-of-the-century bath house, explain that Europeans were then making the
long journey to New Zealand to bathe at the magnificent pink and white
terraces which looked like two great glaciers pushing into the original Lake
Rotomahana, except that these were created by heat rather than cold. They
were regarded as one of the wonders of the world in their day.
The Victorians enjoyed describing these delicate silica cascades in flowery
tones. The hottest, deepest pools were at the top, cooler, shallower ones at
the bottom. The topmost pools on the pink terraces contained shimmering blue
water.
Sadly, the terraces were blown away during the Tarawera eruption, Brad
assured me, but, to his obvious amusement, optimistic expeditions still
arrive occasionally, intent on excavating the terraces from the mud which
buried the two Maori villages of Te Ariki and Moura and partially engulfed a
third during that fateful night.
This last, Te Wairoa, has been excavated and can still be seen on its site,
south-east of Rotorua. It was here that visitors to the terraces would stay
overnight before setting out by boat or on horseback with Maori guides,
often purchasing freshwater crayfish on the way to cook in the terrace
pools. The introduction of a cash economy meant that the destruction of
their money-spinner was an even greater disaster for those who survived.
It is still possible to enjoy a soak in the steaming opaque Polynesian
pools. The acid and alkaline baths are open to the sky and at night they are
dimly lit by strings of white fairy lights. The half-naked figures which
silently came and went through the thick plumes of steam made my baths here
a relaxing but surreal experience.
Today there is a growing fascination with geothermal activity, and the Maori
arts and crafts institute on the edge of Rotorua is partly funded by its
popular guided visits to the boiling mud pools and geysers in its grounds.
The institute fosters the craft of Maori carving.
An evening at a Maori marae (meeting house), where a concert is followed by
the customary hangi (meal cooked under the ground), gives an insight into
the rituals of these people. The arriving party is treated as a rival tribe
by the residents of the village and various rituals are observed.
Warriors come forward with appropriately fierce threats and gestures until
the peaceful intentions of the visitors are established. The night I went we
were approached through the darkness by a tattooed, spear-wielding, grunting
warrior. I am not sure which impressed me most  - this ferocious man or the
unintentional helicopter acrobatics over White Island's yawning maw.

income, here is a significant advantage

THE GREATEST relief from tax lies in enterprise zones. Once the Business
Expansion Scheme has disappeared, at the end of this year, they will offer
the only serious option for investors with significant sums to shelter from
tax.
However, that relief is only offered as a compensation for taking a serious
risk - investing in commercial property in depressed areas.
Promoters of enterprise zone investments have found that the route to
success, as with the BES, is to remove as much risk as possible.
They have succeeded to an extent. Some enterprise zone deals have been
secure, and have sold out quickly in consequence. But the market in
collective investments in enterprise zones has been damaged by a series of
embarrassments for promoters over the past two years, which have left
investors seriously out of pocket.
It is impossible to marginalise risk to the same extent as is achieved with
the BES. For that reason, it is best for most tax shelterers to take
advantage of the BES first, while it still exists, before moving on to
dabbling in enterprise zones.
The tax advantages are undeniable. As with the BES, you are entitled to
relief at your top marginal rate of tax, but without any upper limit, on
investments in enterprise zone property.
This gives EZs a significant advantage for the serious investor over the the
BES, which is limited to Pounds 40,000 a year.
Tax relief is available on loans taken out to fund the property, if the
interest is paid using rental income. And there is no fixed five-year
period.
Most serious investors, with large sums to shelter from tax, have no great
need of income, so this represents a significant advantage.
Special loan deals are often tied up in advance, and offered by enterprise
zone sponsors as an integral part of the investment.
Zone investment comes in two forms - either direct, or as part of enterprise
zone trusts. With a direct investment, you buy an enterprise zone property
outright. Unless you are buying only a small unit, this is likely to be
expensive.
Enterprise zone trusts (EZTs) are syndicated deals which buy a property, and
are then split into units for investment. This allows smaller investors to
invest in large buildings which might otherwise be beyond their scope.
It is also possible to buy into a spread of properties this way, hence
reducing risk. For these reasons, trusts have grown in popularity.
However, they have one big disadvantage compared with direct investment  -
the exit route. No EZT has yet been wound up and its profits realised, so
this remains completely untested. In most cases, it is possible for the
trust to sell after five years, if unitholders agree. Whether they will
agree, given the conflicts of interest which could emerge, and what price
they might receive, remain to be seen.
Some trusts have, in the past, offered defined exit routes by giving
developers options to buy at a fixed price after a fixed period.
How should you choose between trusts? According to Ian Pugh, of the
Allenbridge Group, the vital factor is a sizeable, secure income stream. If
you have this, then you can gear up to make the investment with some
confidence.
The yield (the rent paid each year expressed as a proportion of the purchase
price) is important here. Allenbridge avoided EZTs last year, because the
premium (in terms of a lower yield) which developers asked for in return for
EZ tax advantages was too great.
However, yields are now more in line with the market, according to Pugh,
allowing investors some genuine value.
Security is harder to legislate for. In an ideal situation, the property is
pre-let to a financially strong tenant. In a few cases, EZTs have even
bought property for government departments, whose covenants are obviously
very secure.
In other cases, covenants in force are much weaker. Bankers' guarantees
should be available as a fall-back on an EZT, to keep paying a fixed level
of rent if pre-arranged tenants default. These will only usually be
available for the first few years of the trust's existence, but add
significantly to the security.
EZTs with financially weak tenants, lacking the security of a bank
guarantee, are best avoided.
Last year, other problems also bedevilled EZ investors. A disagreement over
how the land element in a property purchase (which is not eligible for tax
relief) should be valued led to lengthy delays in tax relief being paid by
the Inland Revenue. Other schemes had to endure long waits before the
Revenue would confirm that they had qualified for tax relief.
These factors helped to make last year (1992-93) a disaster for the
industry, with only Pounds 43.2m invested in EZTs, compared with about
Pounds 160m in both of the two previous tax years. The popularity of BES
non-recourse loans did not help.
But next year, enterprise zone investment may well make a recovery. Once the
BES has disappeared, investors anxious to shelter from tax will have little
alternative.
But it is vital to examine the security and strength of the underlying
property. It never makes sense to make an investment for tax reasons alone.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Travel: An aristocrat in the Outback - Nicholas Woodsworth
fends off the crocs in an Englishman's luxury resort in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH

<TEXT>
WHEN Will Burrell told me the evening I arrived at El Questro that he was
having a spot of trouble with a salty in the gorge, and would I like to
throw a muffin at it, I hoped my face did not show total incomprehension. I
said I would be delighted to.
Leading me outside the living room to a wide wooden veranda, he placed a
muffin in my hand and told me to let fly. Down in a wide arc it sailed until
some 40ft below the house it landed with a splash. In the glare of
spotlights illuminating the gorge over which the El Questro homestead sits
precariously cantilevered, I watched a horde of small bream throw themselves
on the muffin.
Abruptly they scattered. An impossibly large, dark form rose through the
murky water, rippled its surface, and, like the muffin, vanished.
'Salt-water crocodile,' murmured Will. 'About 15ft. Sometimes they come
up-river from the mudflats on the Cambridge gulf. They are killers,
absolutely vicious. He would be much happier to eat you than a bit of
bread.' He turned to Celia, his muffin supplier and wife-to-be. 'Do remind
me, darling,' he said, 'to phone the croc-catcher on Monday.'
Will Burrell is probably the last person you would expect to find running a
1m-acre cattle station and luxury resort in the middle of nowhere. A tall,
languid Englishman with fair hair and public school manners, there is
something of the tearaway about him. He might more properly be found in
various London haunts than here in the Kimberley, one of the wildest and
most isolated regions of northern Australia.
Equally, there is something of the old-fashioned gentleman-adventurer about
this 26-year-old. Will's great-grandfather, Lord Thomas Denham, went to
Australia as its governor-general and started a tradition. Succeeding
generations have also travelled out as young men for stints Down Under.
Will has thrown himself into the deep end. Two years ago he was wearing a
grey suit and working as a City of London financial management consultant.
His purchase of El Questro in a near-derelict state has changed his
priorities. Today you are more likely to find him in dirty work-shirt and
chasing cows on the back of a trail-bike.
He and Celia, daughter of a Melbourne business family, are now more
concerned with beef markets than financial ones - he is working to build-up
a herd of 3,000 cattle - and have opened what is probably the most luxurious
outback resort in Australia. They are also having a good deal of fun.
I enjoyed doing what most guests at El Questro do. Ninety minutes' flight
from the coastal city of Darwin and an hour's four-wheel-drive from the
nearest shops or settlement, the homestead sits in splendid isolation in the
midst of vast, spectacular and unpopulated hill country. There is an
end-of-the-earth feeling about the place which makes the vivid contrast
between opulent living and wild surroundings all the more remarkable.
Salties or no salties, I puttered down the Chamberlain gorge in a small
boat, past high red cliffs, odd tropical plants and sulphur-crested
cockatoos, to gaze at Aboriginal rock paintings; they are as mysterious as
messages from space. Surrounded by lush panadus palms and with a cold drink
in hand, I lay in the natural rock pool of the Zebedee hot springs, sighed
deeply, and felt sorry for people with whirlpool baths.
At the station paddocks five miles down the road from the homestead, I
watched in consternation as the wives and young children of stockmen,
mounted and thundering through the dust at impossible speed, tore about
after heifers at an impromptu rodeo. Outbackers are as tough as any cowboys
in the American west. Miraculously, all survived, but I declined an
invitation to break my own neck.
These thrills palled, though, when one morning a helicopter flew in and
settled gently on the manicured lawns of the homestead. As fond as he is of
working with horses and cattle, Will has an almost overpowering addiction to
playing with bait and fishing rods. It is something his wife will have to
watch in the future. But what red-blooded gentleman-adventurer could resist
fishing El Questro-style, which means jumping into a helicopter, flying to
some river canyon or estuary and fishing for the great barramundi,
Australia's premier sports fish.
I am not inexperienced in matters of aerial transport. I have flown in
crippled Russian Tupelovs, scared myself silly with hung-over Cessna pilots
in the Sahara and jumped from Swiss mountains in nylon para-gliders. But
none of these experiences matches the fun of flying low over the red rock
ridges of the Australian outback in a perspex bubble with the doors removed.
From up above one gets an idea of the emptiness and ruggedness of the
Kimberley, and the temerity of the people who have settled it. This is not a
country for the faint-at-heart. Here we were just 15` off the equator and a
short hop from the southern islands of Indonesia. In 'winter' the land can
turn tinder-dry and die of prolonged drought; in the 'Wet', the monsoon
season, temperatures rise to 40`C, the air becomes saturated with moisture,
and heavy rainfall cuts roads for weeks at a time.
Heat, humidity, isolation and hard outdoor work breed a special type here.
The people who live and work in Australia's Top End - truck drivers and
miners, croc-catchers and buffalo hunters, cattlemen and helicopter
musterers - are as tough as the land around them. But they are also
dreamers: visionaries sustained by the belief that one day their hard work
will bring prosperity to the area.
Will Burrell is no different. As we flew over the green ribbon of the
Pentecost river we could follow its twisting course northward through
sparsely-covered bush to the Cambridge gulf and the tropical waters of the
Timor sea. Up on the gulf, amid miles of mudflats and mangrove swamps, lies
the tiny port of Wyndham, a sleep-stunned settlement that once lived on the
hopes of gold mining.
Today it dreams of a future as a port for new Australian exports to Asia. In
his mind's eye Will sees thousands of bellowing El Questro cattle being
loaded live at Wyndham for shipment to the cities of Malaysia and Indonesia.
For now, though, there were barramundi to catch. With only inches of space
free for its whirling rotors, the helicopter put down on a rocky shelf
beside the Durack river. First there was a matter of bait, the barramundi's
favourite being the pop-eyed mullet that swarm in the brackish shallows
along the mudflats.
We caught a few pop-eyes, but Amanda, a member of our party, had a truly
surprising catch. No sooner had she cast her line into midstream than a
great black and white fish eagle dropped out of the sky, firmly embedded the
hook in its talons, and rose into the air. It took some skill to play the
bird down to earth and free it.
As the afternoon wore on we all caught bream and catfish, but in the end it
was Amanda, again, a city dweller from Melbourne, who proved the best
outback fisher. A hard strike, a long struggle, a quick tail-dance on the
surface of the river and minutes later a prehistoric-looking barramundi was
roasting over our river-side fire.
One of these days, Will told me later that evening as the campfire burned
low and we put in some punishing work on a bottle of Bundaberg over-proof
rum, he and Celia will move back to England. One cannot avoid ancestral
duties and the more conventional life forever. But he did not seem too sad.
Life might be tamer in Mayfair and the green hills of Surrey, but El Questro
will always be there to return to. No matter what the dreamers and
visionaries come up with, they will never entirely tame the outback.
Nicholas Woodsworth travelled to Australia with British Airways (tel:
081-897-4000). BA return fares begin at Pounds 1,245. His trip was arranged
by Austravel, 50 Conduit St. London, W1R 9FB, tel: 071-734-7755.
Accommodation at El Questro homestead (12 guests maximum) costs Pounds 200
per day inclusive. Rates for helicopter fishing are Pounds 75 per half-hour
flying time. Further information about camping, bunk-house and twin cabin
accommodation on the station may be had from El Questro, PO Box 909,
Kununurra, Western Australia 6743, tel/fax: (091)-614320.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (10): Property offers
shelter from risk - Tax-efficient investments 2, The Business Expansion
scheme / There is little time left in which to make an investment that
provides one of the most generous tax-breaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RISK AND business expansion schemes used to go hand in hand. Originally, the
BES was intended as a way of raising equity for new businesses from the
private sector.
The carrot for investors was the generous tax relief extended at the
investor's marginal rate, as long as the BES shares were held for five
years. Any gains made on the sale of the shares were free of income and
capital gains taxes. But the tax incentives were often not enough to make up
for the stick of risk. As Nick Percival, director of Best Investment, says:
'The early schemes were high-risk trading companies, and a lot of the
companies did not make any money.'
The scheme changed in 1988, when the government decided to use it to bolster
the private rental property sector. Tax rebates were offered to investors in
companies which purchased and then let property on assured tenancies.
It was with assured tenancies that the BES really took off - attracting
Pounds 345m in the 1988-89 tax year, compared with Pounds 175m the previous
year - as people perceived investment in property as a safer bet than
trading companies. Assured-tenancy schemes now dominate the BES market.
The sponsors have been ingenious in constructing schemes to squeeze out risk
through the introduction of bank guarantees and arranged-exit schemes,
whereby the sale of the BES company shares is pre-arranged at a set price.
To make the schemes even more appealing, the 'loan-back' BES was invented
last autumn, whereby investors would take out a loan, with shares in a BES
company as security.
This allowed them to realise their investments after six months instead of
five years - a blatant contravention of the spirit of the legislation, but
it pulled in the investors, who provided Pounds 928m of BES funding in the
1992-93 tax year, almost three-quarters of which was in loan-back schemes.
The government abolished the schemes in the March budget, having already
announced, in its 1992 budget, that the BES would be wound up on December 31
this year.
The assured-tenancy schemes fall into two broad types. In an arranged-exit
scheme, the company, on whose behalf the scheme is being issued, contracts
to buy back back the shares at a pre-arranged price after five years; some
arrange for cash deposits or a bank guarantee to back up the obligation.
A recent innovation has been to link returns to rises in the stock market,
instead of offering an exit price.
The cash-backed arranged-exit schemes, combined with the generous tax relief
 -a higher-rate taxpayer parts with only Pounds 24,000 for a Pounds 40,000
investment - has made the BES a proposition for serious investors to
consider, once they have taken advantage of other tax-efficient investments.
The early assured tenancies, issued in 1988, have not fared well, however,
according to Ian Pugh, of Best BES Advice, because they bought property at
the height of the market.
Investors in the early schemes also face the problem of removing tenants and
selling the properties at a good profit.
Arranged-exit schemes: A higher exit price may reflect greater risk. The
Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College issue, in July, sponsored by Downing
Corporate Finance, offered an exit price of 127p after five years for every
100p invested, making it one of the highest returns, but it had little cash
backing.
Where there is cash backing, Nick Percival says that the investor should
check that this is for the full exit price and not just a portion. If there
is a bank guarantee instead, check that the bank has a good credit rating.
Other points to note are the reputation of the sponsor and its ability to
send out BES 3 certificates, which are needed to claim the tax relief,
quickly. The effective annual returns to the investor quoted by the sponsors
are based on the BES 3 certificates being sent out in time for the investor
to claim tax relief for the year, otherwise the overall return to them is
reduced.
Stock market-linked schemes: There is no arranged exit price. Instead, the
investor receives a fixed price per share (minimum 60p - the effective
investment after tax relief is given) after five years, plus a return linked
to the FT-SE 100 index.
As with a personal equity plan, the investment will be free of income or
capital gains tax. BESSA Oxford, issued in August by sponsors Close
Brothers, had automatic lock-ins, to protect against falls in the market
towards the end of the five-year maturity date.
David Harris, of independent financial advisers Chantrey Financial Services,
says that these schemes are best suited to the wealthier investor who can
afford the worst-case scenario of a drop in the market.
Tax considerations: There are different ways of obtaining tax relief,
depending on whether you are under the PAYE system or are self-employed.
In the former case, a proportion of the relief will be given every month,
according to Mavis Seymour, BES specialist at accountants Stoy Hayward. 'If,
having made an investment in August 1993, the inspector changes your PAYE
code in time for your January 1994 salary payment, you should obtain 10/12
of the BES relief in January, 1/12 in February and 1/12 in March 1994,' she
said.
If you are self-employed and pay half your tax liability on January 1, 1994,
and half on July 1, 1994, half of the BES relief received before January 1
reduces each of these payments.
The BES has been structured in a way to appeal to the higher-rate taxpayer,
but, like all investment decisions, the choice should be made on the
soundness of the investment rather than purely on considerations of tax
savings. Independent financial advice should be taken before making a
decision.
Best BES Advice, published by the Allenbridge Group (071 409-1111), and BESt
Investment (071 936-2037) monitor the industry and provide research and
advice.
The BES Association (071 613-0032) operates as the trade association. Also
useful are Inland Revenue pamphlets IR 51, The BES; and IR 85, The BES -
Private Rented Housing.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Fashion: A crash course in fashion on a grant - Sasha
Jensen, a third year at Warwick University, offers some tips for first-time
students on looking good on a tight budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SASHA JENSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU have won a place at university this October the words budget, budget
and budget will probably be echoing in your head. This is, after all,
probably the first time you will be officially in charge of your own life.
Apart from the precious pounds you will spend on books, accommodation and
food, there is the matter of your wardrobe. Clothes should be suitable for
the life you lead - and student life normally consists of going to and from
lectures, playing lots of sport and socialising in any and every pub you can
find. Thus you need to find some cheap but good-quality buys that will stand
you in good stead during your stay in academia.
The essentials are jumpers, jackets, track suits, tops, a decent pair of
shoes and some jeans - and you ought to be able to find all this for a
maximum of Pounds 100.
Marks and Spencer is an excellent first stop for the bargains essential to
every budget-conscious student. The M &amp; S unisex 'warmhandle' shirt (Pounds
29.95) is a thick, brushed cotton shirt which will keep the cold air away on
a wind-swept campus. It comes in red, black or a colourful Mexican-style
stripe. To match this there are jeans for men and women for Pounds 19.99
available in all colours.
Its lycra-jodhpurs (Pounds 19.99) are the basis of many a female student
wardrobe as they can be teamed with almost anything: the unisex M &amp; S
T-shirt (Pounds 7.99) or a round-neck ribbed top at Pounds 13.99 which comes
in black, white or lime. Look out also for a nice patterned wool/silk-mix
jumper (Pounds 35) in colours such as cream, lime and peach.
Young women heading straight for the disco after lectures should snap up the
M &amp; S crushed velvet, suede-look leggings - they are stunning in dark brown,
beige and black (Pounds 19.99) and would match the wool/silk jumper or the
arrow cuff and collar shirt (Pounds 19.99) which comes in white or blue.
The menswear department is always worth looking through - best buys I
spotted include striped rugby tops for Pounds 19.99 or a good black and red
checked shirt at Pounds 25.
To see you through three years you will need good quality shoes. For girls
there is the classic leather penny loafer in black or red-brown at a
reasonable Pounds 25.99, or the more dressy but less practical suede loafer
with a slight heel (Pounds 25). Boys could step out in M &amp; S's heavy
work-boots (Pounds 45), loafers in black and brown (Pounds 29.95) and a
reliable brogue at Pounds 29.95.
A really warm coat is vital. M &amp; S has two types of fleece jacket which will
shelter you from colds, flu and bankruptcy: a navy blue zip-jacket with
checked collar at a mere Pounds 35 or a blue and green check jacket which
zips at the front at the same price.
All students should make their way to a Levis store - a sturdy pair of jeans
is a must for college and Levis offers a 10 per cent discount to those who
can produce their library or student card. Levis has a new range of jeans
that might pass for casual trousers, which helps to explain the price. The
unisex 417 (Pounds 50) comes in saddle, blue, green, ecru and black. It has
a hugging fit but can be worn in a baggy style.
To match this there are short-sleeved, ribbed grandad tops in black, red,
white and cream at Pounds 20.70. The most interesting trouser design is the
Bedford cord (Pounds 50.50) which is close fitting and looks like a cross
between a cord and a jean.
Students who are really pushed for money should head for Flip in Long Acre,
Covent Garden, London. It is one of the cheapest places for T-shirts and
jeans, partly because most of the clothes it sells are second-hand. You can
find some second-hand Lee and Levis jeans for Pounds 15 downstairs. Upstairs
there is an array of second-hand jackets, waist coats and jeans going even
cheaper - from Pounds 10.
Flip sells new clothes, too: grandad tops for Pounds 16.99, T-shirts
starting at Pounds 4.99, long sleeved T-shirts at Pounds 9.99, track-suit
bottoms for Pounds 22.99 and a fluffy sweat-shirt top with a hood for Pounds
25.99.
Just two doors up from Flip is Longpoint Bay, where you can rummage around
for stylish bargains. The sweat jean-jacket Pounds 42.50 is shaped like the
classic jean-jacket, which means you can dress it up or down, with jeans or
trousers. If you are bored with the usual sweat-pants look Longpoint has its
own 'jogging trousers' which have a trouser-like effect because of the smart
zip that sits in the side of the leg. Colours for the jacket and joggers are
navy, bottle green, red, and grey.
To match these there are some long-sleeved button-up tops for the girls, in
grey and white (Pounds 22.99), and some button-up long-sleeved polo shirts
with ribbed cuff and collar in navy, red black, and bottle-green (Pounds
29.95). The unisex roll-neck polo top is a little number everyone could use
 -it can be worn with almost anything and is a sure way to keep warm in
student digs when winter arrives. Colours include mustard, crimson, cream,
black and navy. There is also an array of over-dyed jeans (Pounds 36.95) in
all sorts of colours, including blue, red, and green.
Another good port of call for budget shopping is the Next chain of stores.
The women's checked 'weekend' shirt at Pounds 29.99 is colourful and
thermal. The button-through V-neck jersey-top (Pounds 19.99 in black or
rose) can be worn either to the college disco or the daily seminar.
For boys there is a cotton striped rugby shirt in blues or red and green
(Pounds 29.99), or a heavy-knit polo-neck which comes in aqua and a light
cream. If anyone, male or female, wants a really cosy jumper then the
menswear section is the place to look. Next's ribbed neck and cuff sweater
(Pounds 34.99) is famous for its wonderful rib stitching. If you want a
heavier jumper then the chunky-rib turtle-neck fits the bill - it is
available in navy or stone for Pounds 29.99. Next also has some nice
sweat-shirts at Pounds 29.99 in blue and green.
Two other chains that women should look at are Oasis and River Island. The
Oasis Bohemian-print ankle-length skirt with lace-up top to match is an
outfit that is fashionable but flexible because it can be worn in the
evening or the day. There is a long white shirt which you can mix and match
with anything.
River Island has lots to offer the poundless student. There is a pinafore
dress with black and cream dot print (Pounds 39.99), a black button-through
flared skirt with white stitching (Pounds 16.99), some black lycra leggings
at (Pounds 9.99) and a grey, ribbed, cropped jersey top (Pounds 16.99).
Choose just a few of these items and you have yourself a wardrobe to take
you though winter, spring and summer - all for under Pounds 100.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Fashion: The return of an old Italian master - In the 1950s
Brioni epitomised La Dolce Vita. It is still the last word in subdued
classics for men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS ONE of the world's most expensive menswear companies. Its suits are
favoured by top international business executives, film stars and foreign
royals. The precursor of Nino Cerruti and Giorgio Armani by several years,
it pioneered the Italian look. Yet, in the UK, it remains one of fashion's
best-kept secrets, in an industry that is big on hype, it has quietly gone
about the business of tailoring, relying on the exclusive grapevine of its
rich and famous customers as it main marketing vehicle.
On Monday, Beale and Inman, on London's New Bond Street, starts its Brioni
Week, the first promotion of the Brioni brand by a UK retailer for more than
30 years. Around the corner at Savile Row, the grand old tailors who recall
the last promotion may feel an uncomfortable sense of deja vu.
When Brioni launched its collection in the UK in 1959, a newspaper headline
shouted: 'Look out, London] Here comes another Roman invasion'. The
company's mission was to usurp the heavy, bespoke suit with its own
lightweight, ready-to-wear version. The ambassador of Italian style aimed to
revolutionise men's fashion.
The scene of the historic debut was a catwalk show at the Hyde Park Hotel in
Knightsbridge, London, organised by Brioni stockist, the newly-opened (now
deceased) store, Woollands of Knightsbridge. Men's fashion 'parades' and
men's boutiques, not to mention the collection, were considered to be
incredibly risque at the time. The Spectator said the event was 'as brave an
act as holding a whist drive in the Kremlin for the Friends of Capitalism.'
The style commentators of the day marveled at the novel use of colour and
fabric. The range included emerald silk smoking jackets, plus cashmere
coats, lilac striped shirts with matching brocade waistcoats, crimson and
white brushed mohair blazers and even suede trenchcoats.
The latter was, according to the critic in The Spectator, 'all hung about
with tabs and windbreaks and buttoning etceteras; worn with skin tight
trousers, there seemed nevertheless to be some lack of pockets and the model
was actually carrying a handbag.'
While many concluded that the more progressive excesses were unsuited to
British tastes, others applauded the new slimline silhouette and the relaxed
elegance, achieved by the lightest of wools and, most important, the absence
of padding. Jackets had three buttons at the front, two vents at the back,
sloped shoulders and the widest point of the lapels was 2in. Trousers were
17in round the bottom with no turn-ups.
This was a far cry from anything else before: the utilitarian demob suit in
coarse grey wool, with its enormous shoulder pads, oversized chest, high cut
trouser and wide shoe-covering leg was standard. The more advanced Savile
Row tailors such as Bunny Rogers had reinvented the Edwardian look by
producing frock-coat style jackets, narrow 'Guards' trousers and
velvet-collared covert coats, topped by bowler hats. This trend, combined
with the Zoot suit from the US, may have given birth to street style and the
teddy boy phenomenon, but it was too dandy to take off among traditional
bespoke customers.
Meanwhile, Rome was gaining a worldwide reputation for glamour and style
following the hit film La Dolce Vita. Brioni's founders, Nazareno Fonticoli,
the tailor, and Gaetano Savini, the business brain, captured the mood of the
'sweet life', realising that society was more cosmopolitan, men now lived in
climate-controlled homes and offices, drove cars, were slimmer and healthier
and did not want or need heavy, stiff, grey clothing.
Brioni is no longer in the fashion vanguard, preferring to emphasise to
customers that an exquisitely cut, classic suit in the finest cloth is an
investment. Although the bulk of its business is ready-to-wear, it still
adopts bespoke techniques and takes great pride in the craftsmanship of its
tailors.
The company employs 700 workers including 200 tailors and makes 250 suits
each day. Each suit takes 18 hours to make from individual hand-cutting
through hand-stiching and ironing. It also keeps the measurements of 25,000
clients on computer in Rome, allowing customers to order custom-made suits
by telephone and receive them in five weeks without even a fitting.
However, the main attraction is the cloth, much of which is from British
mills Bower &amp; Roebuck and Johnston. Try most suits with an Italian designer
label and you notice how light and smooth they feel. Try on a Brioni suit
and you feel you might as well be wearing silk pyjamas. It is possible to
roll up a Brioni Cashmere overcoat into the size of a rugby ball, stick it
into a suitcase for a few hours. When you unfold it, it will be crease free.
The pursuit of excellence does not come cheap. Off-the-peg suits range from
Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 1,900 and custom-made suits from Pounds 3,500 to
Pounds 4,000. An unlined cashmere overcoat costs Pounds 1,695, a blazer,
Pounds 995, a shirt, Pounds 189, and a silk tie and handkerchief set, Pounds
119.
This level of the market is recession-proof, according to Umberto Angelino,
Brioni's chief executive. Clients past and present include Henry Fonda, John
Wayne, Peter Sellers, Rock Hudson, Richard Burton, King Constantine, the
King of Malaysia, film director Michael Winner, Arab sheikhs and even former
arts minister David Mellor.
Next week at Beale and Inman, the full Brioni collection will be displayed
and the company's master tailor, Checchio Fonticoli, will be at hand to take
measurements for custom-made suits and ready-to-wear adjustments.
Brioni gained a reputation for being a bit nouveau riche during the 1980s.
It tended to be too flexible to outlandish demands from customers. It was
the 'if sir wants a cream silk safari suit, he may have one' syndrome. Now,
Brioni is focusing on its subdued classics, believing that quality can come
in all guises - but it is better when it is tasteful.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (9): Guard now against
future governments' tax policies - Tax-efficient investments 1, Personal
Equity Plans / Peps offer a useful shelter for capital gains, explains
Philip Coggan, which is why some of their biggest users appear to be people
with large portfolios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST sight, it might seem that the annual Pounds 6,000 limit on a
personal equity plan would make little dent on a millionaire's portfolio -
making Peps of only marginal interest to the wealthy investor.
But since the first Peps were sold in 1987, a husband and wife could have
accumulated over Pounds 92,000 if they had put in the maximum allowance each
year (if you include the additional Pounds 3,000 single-company Peps, which
started in 1992). Throw in a modest amount for growth and you have a
six-figure portfolio.
All income and gains made within a Pep are free from tax. Depending on the
plan you choose, you may find that much of the income tax benefit is eaten
up by management charges, at least in the early years. However, the benefits
of a Pep are much more clear-cut for a 40 per cent taxpayer.
A wealthy investor will also be able to use a Pep as a shelter against
capital gains tax. Anyone with more than Pounds 100,000 in investments might
find it quite easy to make gains greater than the annual CGT threshold -
Pounds 5,800 in 1993-94.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of the biggest users of Peps to date
have been investors with large portfolios, who have gradually switched their
holdings into a tax-free form.
The snag is that there are only relatively limited circumstances in which
shares can be transferred directly into a Pep. Instead, the shares must be
sold and then bought again via the Pep manager. That incurs dealing costs;
but, even more important, it creates a liability to capital gains tax at the
time of sale.
So there needs to be careful planning when existing shares are placed in a
Pep. One route might be to take the opportunity to sell some unprofitable
holdings, realising a CGT loss which will offset the gain on the shares you
want to place inside the Pep.
Brian Tora, of stockbrokers Greig Middleton, says he uses a Pep as a chance
to take a critical look at a client's portfolio. 'Are there any investments
which can be sold to raise cash? That cash can then be used to invest in the
latest ideas, and put those investments in a Pep.'
Once inside a Pep, the investor can switch between shares without any fear
of the tax consequences. The only real restrictions are the need to be in
shares, not gilts or cash. Cash can only be held as a short-term measure
while funds are 'awaiting investment', which may restrict the
manoeuvrability of an investor who wants to pull out of shares at the top of
the market.
Finding the right Pep manager is, of course, an important part of the
process. Most private client stockbrokers will provide their own Pep, but
charges can vary enormously between firms. Chase de Vere publishes an annual
Pep guide* which gives details of managers and their charging structures.
If you already use a stockbroker, you may find that the convenience of
keeping all your investments in one place may be more important than the
saving you will make by moving to a lower-charging broker.
Alternatively, you could concentrate your Pep portfolio on unit and
investment trusts (although you cannot use the Pounds 3,000 single-company
Pep allowance for collective funds). Some unit trust Pep groups, such as
Fidelity, have a low front-end charge, with an exit fee for those who sell
during the early years; provided you are prepared to invest for the long
term, this might be an attractive charging structure.
Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts tend to impose an additional charge
for Peps; nevertheless, the overall charges of an investment trust will
usually be lower. Split-capital investment trust shares can also form part
of an overall investment strategy; for example, someone who is bullish on
the market, but who regularly faces a CGT bill, might place capital shares
within a Pep to get the maximum tax-free capital gain.
Figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds show how a
Pep really can pay off over the long term. Someone who invested Pounds 1,000
in the median UK equity income unit trust would have seen his investment
grow to Pounds 1,436 over the five years to July 1. Had the money been in
the same fund, but in a Pep, the money would have grown to Pounds 1,549.
Over 10 years, the difference is slightly greater: Pounds 4,298, compared
with Pounds 5,028 within a Pep. But over 25 years, the difference is
startling; Pounds 21,945 in a taxed environment, against Pounds 38,073 for a
Pep. Those are powerful statistics for any 40-year-old thinking of
additional ways of saving for his or her retirement.
But perhaps the best argument for a Pep is that no one knows what future tax
policy will be. With the government running a Pounds 50bn budget deficit,
the wealthy may well face an increase in their tax burden. For them, the
more money that can be tucked away in a tax-free environment, the better.

FT  18 SEP 93 / How to Spend It: Bright ideas for lighting - How to
transform your home with subtle shades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE seen some hideous light fittings in other people's houses and I have
installed (or more accurately hammered in) some pretty terrible fixtures in
my own home. In fact, three inherited 1970s style tracked spotlights are
aimed at my head as I write - so ghastly is the sight that I am paralysed
into inaction.
Very few people get lighting right. Many simply do not bother and use the
pendants granny left them, while others fill their ceilings and walls with
the latest fiddly systems from pretentious designers with hairdresser names.
There is a way out of the darkness, but finding it is difficult. This is
because the business of lighting is, it seems, three parts technical, five
parts fashion and two parts nonsense. Making mistakes is not only
terrifically easy but terrifyingly expensive. If you, like me, have shadows
where you want light and glare where you need a soft, reassuring glow, read
on.
There are three routes to effective illumination - all involve thinking,
bother and money. The difference between the options is in the price and the
degree of nuisance.
Option one: hire a lighting consultant. These are people who know their
footcandles from their lux (metric and imperial measures of illumination)
and will wash a wall with light rather than graze it (in-talk for a dappled
effect). This option is only for those prepared to spend quite a lot of
money to get the job done well.
Consultants will ask about needs, make suggestions and then produce a plan.
Architects can do the job, but the cost will probably be the same, so it is
worth going for the specialists. The consultants will also organise the
electricians, find the right fittings and oversee the job.
It is inevitable that the room or house will have to be cleared. Beefy men
with cold chisels, power screwdrivers and portable radios tuned to Kiss FM
will move in and create dusty mayhem. They will hack channels in the walls,
lift floorboards and rip up ceilings to hide wires and bulky fittings.
This is not a job for the faint-hearted, but in the end the chances are
strong (but not guaranteed) that you will have a room which is both
functional and comfortable. It is probably best to coincide this brutal
activity with re-wiring or timing it to precede the next decoration.
Option two: become your own consultant. This and the final option involve
quite a lot of learning. It is the stage I am in now and I wish I was rich
enough to hire a consultant.
The first step is to buy a book that gives the basics and is written for the
DIY enthusiast rather than architects or professional interior designers.
Most books on interiors, such as the Conran series, have chapters on
lighting. But the best - although far from brilliant - choice is the The
Lighting Book by Deyan Sudjic (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 14.99).
This is a book where the text was, it seems, written around a bunch of stock
pictures. But Sudjic has some good hints and provides the basic theory of
lighting in an approachable format. In spite of its inadequacies, the book
will help prevent elementary blunders and save its cover price many times
over.
You, like me, will learn about the different qualities of light sources  -
traditional tungsten versus tungsten-halogen and fluorescent (warm,
intermediate and cool). The quantities of light needed, the distribution,
effects, and fittings are described. And there are plenty of pictures to see
how others have achieved well-lit bliss. The book also lists consultants and
suppliers.
With some learning, and lots of enthusiasm, it is possible to plan your own
lighting scheme. Start with pencil and paper (draw on a squared sheet to
scale, if possible) and not in the shop. Buying the equipment and fittings
is the last part of the task.
Collect catalogues from lighting shops and use the information provided to
work out how many fittings you need to get the desired effect. This is
sometimes difficult for the uninitiated, so experiment as much as possible
with an extension cord and temporary fittings.
After many weekends wasted on bodging DIY jobs, I have learnt to hire
professionals who do the job well and in half the time. This is especially
necessary with the safety that electricity demands.
Once you have drawn up the plan, talk it through with a qualified
electrician who will be able to help on the technicalities and should be
able to buy most of the fittings at trade prices.
This is particularly true if you decide to use recessed fittings and
low-voltage systems. The supplier catalogues will show the sort of space
needed in, say, the ceiling void, but an experienced electrician will be
able to make an instant judgment on the practicalities. It is always wise to
build in as much flexibility as possible.
Option three: fiddle with what you have. Given that most lighting has not
been planned at all, it is possible to make huge improvements with a little
thought and a few changes to the fittings. This is probably the best course
if you rent and are not allowed to hack into the fabric of the building to
hide wires and recess fittings.
Dramatic differences can be achieved simply by reducing the role of the
central pendant, changing shades, installing dimmers (remember that some new
light sources, such as low-energy bulbs, cannot be dimmed), plugging in more
table lamps, bouncing light off ceilings and shifting existing lights by
lengthening the flex.
The least you can do is reduce eyestrain and make your home more welcoming.

FT  18 SEP 93 / How to Spend It: From boardroom to the bedroom - Want to
work from home? John Morgan advises on how to set up the perfect in-house
office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH many people dream of working from home, few seem to be very good at
it when they get the chance. Some, after years of institutionalised
corporate life, find it difficult to adjust to a self-imposed regime. Others
discover that they are easily waylaid by domestic distractions.
However, advances in technology and more elastic attitudes towards work are
making working from home, and its fashionable sibling, 'flexible' working,
increasingly feasible and attractive options. With a little planning,
judicious investment and some imagination, running your office from your
house can significantly improve your lifestyle. Here are a few tips.
First, stick to regular office hours. An acquaintance of mine, having left
the City of London to begin his own consultancy, kept to his previous
routine with military precision: he rose, bathed, dealt with his
correspondence and calls at the same time as before; he even dressed in his
business suit for a while.
This helped him make a successful transition from one way of working to
another.
It is also a good idea to have your office as far away as possible from the
diversions of home life: in a distant bedroom, attic, basement or, as in the
case of a certain romantically-minded writer, in a strawberry gothic
summerhouse.
Then you will want to construct an office. You will obviously need some sort
of desk, perhaps put together from components. The Nomos Collection by Tecno
is probably the most flexible and stylish of this kind.
Designed by Sir Norman Foster, it uses a simple tubular system to construct
a variety of surfaces ranging from the simplest table to workstations that
can accommodate complicated filing, sophisticated up-lighting and complex
electronic equipment with its attendant wiring and cabling.
The structures are free-standing and can be easily enlarged or modified.
Nomos is available in a choice of finishes including glass, laminate and
wood, and therefore manages to suit both traditional and modem interiors.
Prices start at Pounds 2,700.
Technology, although the sine qua non of the home office, remains a
stumbling block for many. A bewildering array of products, often with
overlapping functions, can make choosing the right equipment confusing and
unnecessarily costly.
The first investment is a good computer: one that will not only fulfil your
current needs, but that also has the capacity to accommodate your business
future expectations. Whether you choose an Apple Macintosh or an IMB
compatible system is now largely a matter of preference, as both systems now
share similar functions.
Apple was designed as a totally integrated graphical system and is thus
ideal for those whose work has a strong visual element such as designers,
journalists and even estate agents. It is very user friendly, elegantly
designed and includes myself in its loyal following.
Apple's Performa range is for the beginner and has been designed to be
simple to use. It is available in three models, the most advanced being the
Performa 600CD, Pounds 2199, which has an internal CD Rom Drive. Or users
can invest in the Mackintosh Duo System, around Pounds 2000, which combines
a portable notebook and desktop computer. The notebook slots (docks) in or
out of the main desktop computer and is ideal for working on the move. It is
light, powerful and has a standard-sized key-board and a bright easy-to-read
screen.
More advanced is the Centris 660AV, from Pounds 1964 - the computer that you
can talk to. It offers the latest audio visual technologies and provides new
ways to communicate by combining telecommunications, video and speech.
Frome the large array of IBM compatible machines the Dell range can be
recommended as its systems can easily be up-graded Of its three ranges, Dell
Dimension is ideal for the home worker as it is competitively priced at
around Pounds 859 and is backed by the company's excellent support service.
It comes pre-loaded with business software such as Microsoft Office which
has all the basic functions such as data base, spread-sheet and
word-processing.
IBM itself offers several grades of computer ranging from the IBM PS/1,
which is aimed at the first time PC buyer. It is easy to use, set up, and
includes all the basics. But most business users will want at least the PS/2
which has the new fast technology and also boasts a sophisticated data base
and multi-media capabilities.
A glance at one of the computer magazines will show a wide variety of
machines on offer with similar performance, including many offered by mail
order companies. If ordering by mail, however, it is important to be
satisfied that service guarantees will be honoured. Purchase by credit card
can give useful protection against non-delivery.
Increasingly sophisticated telecommunications are also greatly helping those
working from home. Both BT and Mercury now operate voice messaging systems.
Ideal for those who travel a great deal, these enable recorded messages to
be sent from and received through a central 'mailbox'.
The system records more and longer (up to five minutes) messages than the
conventional answering machine and will store them for up to a month. There
is also Email (electronic mail) that allows text messages on a PC to be
sent, via a modem, to mailboxes.
The answering machine, long the freelancer's best friend, has also greatly
improved. The Panasonic KX-F2090BE, Pounds 599 plus VAT, is one of the best
available: it answers calls, records voice messages and sends and receives
faxes. It requires only one line and switches automatically between fax and
telephone. It has a memory and polling function that allows you to check-in
for messages on compatible faxes.
BT has the new DF200, a fax, telephone and answering machine that uses new
digital technology rather than the usual tape. It is very small (slightly
bigger than A4), has ten minutes answering time.
You will also need your own photocopier. Xerox has just launched the 5310,
an easy-to-use, compact copier designed for the home worker. It costs Pounds
1600 and can cope with up to 1,500 copies a month, will reduce and enlarge
images between 70 per cent and 124 per cent, and, thanks to a special bypass
system, copies on to different sizes of paper.
Canon offers a wide choice of very good machines ranging from its new Mini
Copier FC330, Pounds 795 plus VAT, which is very small, portable and
suitable for low volume work to its all-singing, all-dancing big brother,
the CLC10 colour copier, for Pounds 3,450. It produces excellent quality
copies thanks to Canon's 'bubble jet' technology and therefore is ideal for
those who need to produce high-quality colour documents.
If your answering machine does not include a faxing option, a separate fax
machine is vital. Canon has the B200 for Pounds 900, a new plain-paper fax
which produces documents on real paper rather than the usual flimsy,
fadeable thermal variety. Its sharp resolution makes it ideal for faxing
photographs and a 24 hour transmission function allows you to send documents
at pre-set times, thus making the most of international time zones and
cost-effective telephone rates.
Amstrad has recently launched the PS8000 fax. Comfortably known as 'The
Personal Secretary', it sends and receives faxes, copies documents and
records telephone messages. It will also forward messages to you and record
the time they were received.
And finally, your very own portable super secretary - the brand-new Psion
Series 3a hand-held computer, Pounds 329.95. Although small enough to fit in
your pocket it has a remarkably large screen and software of a
sophistication and scale normally found on desk-top computers.
Add an excellent lighting system, a well-designed chair such as a Charles
Eames design from the 1950s, from Pounds 700, and a terrific hi-fi system
for a little music therapy and the totally efficient and life-enhancing home
office is yours.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (8): You may be wise to
fish in the pool - Collective funds / It's less exciting, admits Philip
Coggan, but even the better-off should not ignore unit and investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEALTHY tend to overlook unit and investment trusts. Perhaps this is
because collective funds are seen as suitable only for the 'small investor'
and that, once one has more than Pounds 100,000 or so, direct equities
represent the 'real thing'. Perhaps it is simply more exciting to follow
one's investment in Tesco or Hanson than it is to track the growth of the
M&amp;G Dividend fund.
But unit and investment trusts have a number of advantages that the
better-off investor would be unwise to overlook. For a start, both are
exempt from capital gains tax (CGT) when portfolios are re-arranged. This
means that, while a private investor may hesitate about switching from, say,
Glaxo to British Gas, because of a potential CGT bill, a trust manager can
easily make the change.
Of course, if the investor wanted to sell his holding in a unit or
investment trust, he could still face a potential CGT liability. But a
collective fund makes long-term investing that much easier. Running a
portfolio of direct equities involves the investor in a series of difficult
choices - in which the desire to take profits and the fear of a tax bill
continually come into conflict.
In contrast, if the investor has a stake in a holding in a large investment
trust, he can rely on the manager to make the switches for him. The holding
need only be sold if the manager performs badly, or if cash is needed to
meet an important commitment.
Secondly, unit and investment trusts have published track records which the
investor can monitor. (Figures for the leading trusts appear every three
months in the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, and the statistical
records of all trusts appear every month in the FT's sister publication
Money Management.)
Most private-client stockbrokers say (not unreasonably) that each investor's
temperament and needs are different, so they cannot publish an 'average'
portfolio to show how they have performed. This makes it a lot more
difficult for a potential client to judge whether the firm is worth using.
Another advantage can be cost. In the unit trust sector, wealthier investors
may get a better deal than the less well-off. In July, a reporter from the
FT's sister publication, Financial Adviser, called the dealing desks of 15
unit trust groups, posing as a private investor with Pounds 55,000. He was
offered a discount off the initial charge at 12 of them. The discount varied
between 1 and 3 per cent, a maximum saving of Pounds 1,650.
And among investment trusts, wealthy investors may well find that the
management fees represent good value compared with the charge that would be
levied by a private-client stockbroker for looking after the same amount of
money.
Unit and investment trusts may well offer a wider range of investments than
the private-client stockbroker. One would have to be a very wealthy
individual indeed to be able to buy a spread of equities in, say, the
Brazilian market. A stockbroker seeking to give his clients exposure to such
markets would probably use a unit or investment trust in any case.
Finally, some unit trust groups offer a complete range of funds, including
cash and bond trusts, and allow investors to switch between them at reduced
cost. It is relatively easy to select a trust that will provide the required
level of income, or pure capital growth. They can thus represent a 'one-stop
shop' for an investor's portfolio needs.
Having said all that, there are some areas where unit and investment trusts
may not be able to offer the same services as a stockbroker.
The first is personal service. Some investors like to chat about their
investments with the person in charge of them; that may be impossible if you
are trying to deal with seven or eight very busy investment trust managers.
Furthermore, a private-client stockbroker may be able to offer to
consolidate all the dividend payments (to simplify tax returns) and will
certainly offer regular valuations. The investor using unit and investment
trusts would have to do that for himself.
A stockbroker will also be able to advise a client on the right time to
switch out of equities and into cash, to avoid an event like the crash of
1987 (provided - and this is a pretty large proviso - the broker can see the
crash coming). Most unit and investment trusts are simply unable to switch
from shares into cash on any significant scale.
The investor is also faced with the responsibility of choosing the unit or
investment trusts himself. With some 200 investment trusts and 1,500 unit
trusts in existence, that could be quite an arduous task.
One answer to these problems is to opt for a unit or investment trust
portfolio management service. These tend to be offered by stockbrokers and
independent financial advisers. Most managers offer a range of products
designed to produce growth, income or a balance of the two.
Although this service may be administratively easier, the investor can
easily find himself paying two sets of management fees (one to the broker
and one to the managers of the underlying trusts). In addition, as with the
direct equity service offered by brokers, it may be difficult to obtain past
performance figures for such portfolios.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Fishing: Okay, I'm hooked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
I SEE that British television coverage of the world chess championship is to
extend to 75 hours, which is doubtless pleasing to the country's small band
of chess enthusiasts. For the rest, I suspect that the spectacle of two
immensely brainy men thinking, and assorted lesser brainboxes trying to
divine what they are thinking about, may pall.
It set me pondering on television's scurvy treatment of Britain's most
popular participatory sport, fishing. I fear this reflects a general
prejudice, an absurd picture of a man sitting under a green umbrella staring
through the rain at a motionless float.
In addition, I suspect that few anglers are to be found in the councils of
the programme commissioners. But whatever the bias at work, I doubt if the
total of hours given to the sport since television was invented would match
the time devoted to Kasparov's heavy menace and Short's pink gums and pebbly
spectacles.
There are also obvious factors inhibiting fishing from taking the place of,
say, darts. For long periods not much happens, and when it does, excitement
lies more in the heart of the fisherman than in the event itself. The very
presence of heavy-footed cameramen waving their lenses puts fish to flight.
But there are honourable exceptions. Many years ago the BBC screened a
first-rate series called An Angler's Corner, in which the incomparable
Bernard Venables chewed his pipe and paraded his wisdom. Jack Hargreaves
made many decent, unpretentious films for Southern TV. More recently, Jack
Charlton and John Wilson have made series which - whatever one's
reservations about the antics of the chief performers - have at least given
an idea of what fishing is like.
None of these, however, has remotely approached the series running on BBC 2
on Sunday evenings, A Passion For Angling. In terms of beauty, excitement,
truth and eloquence, these programmes - I write after seeing the first two -
stand alone.
What Hugh Miles, the man who made them, has done is to recruit two of
Britain's finest fishermen, Chris Yates and Bob James, and allow them to
follow their noses - while he follows, camera in hand. Yates and James are
not in the mould of the normal personality. Yates is the best writer on
fishing in the land, and James is his chum. Together, they have evolved
their own philosophy of fishing.
Now, there are weaknesses in all this when shaped to television's demands.
As you sit beside a reed-fringed lake watching the sun begin to suck away
the dawn mist, your mind is liable to be suffused with sub-Wordsorthian
images. Putting those reflections into words which are neither syrupy nor
pretentious is tricky; and having them narrated by Bernard Cribbins is
sometimes a risk too far.
The music - all sighing strings and mellow woodwind - reinforces this
slightly precious atmosphere of the waterside idyll, established in the
first place by the glories of Hugh Miles' camerawork. Nor, in the first
programme, was I enraptured by the starring role given to the lad, Pete,
complete with his bamboo and string, and squashed tweed hat.
But these are minor cavils, compared with the marvels. The second programme
in particular - on carp-fishing at Redmire Pool, home of monster carp - was
tremendous. Here, our heroes shed their self-consciousness as they
contemplated the stately monsters of this fabled water. The moment at which
Yates' second big fish opened his rubbery lips to engulf the floating dog
biscuit was unbearably thrilling. And my children were transfixed by the
climax, at which the intrepid duo leaped from the upper branches of a tree
up to their waists in mud and water to do battle with another leviathan.
Of course, these programmes do not tell anything like the whole truth. The
boredom, the occasional wretchedness, the rages, the heartbreaks are either
absent, or sentimentalised. But what television can do, at its best, is to
give an authentic, intense taste of a reality, and that is what these
programmes do.
The best test is whether they make a fisherman want to fish. Within an hour
of watching perfect Pete catch his 9lb barbel on the Hampshire Avon, I was
seated beside my own favourite barbel swim on the Kennet. I was maddened by
midges, missed a succession of good bites, and in the end caught - not a
barbel - but a 4lb tench. That is real fishing.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Only a short wait now for the big cheque: Leonard Barden and
David Spanier analyse the manoeuvres on and off the board at the world
championships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEONARD BARDEN and DAVID SPANIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKMAKERS have stopped quoting odds on Gary Kasparov's victory in the world
chess championship, and an international guess-their-moves competition has
been abandoned because of lack of interest. Kasparov leads Nigel Short 4-1
before today's sixth game at London's Savoy Theatre, and watching
grandmasters are worried that the match will be finished far quicker than
its scheduled 24 games spread over a leisurely eight weeks.
Short has lacked confidence when the game reaches its crisis, usually in the
fourth hour of play when the time limit approaches. In game one, he lost on
time in a good position; in game three, he missed two easy draws; in game
four, he caught Kasparov with a prepared opening but failed to create a
decisive attack and lost. Only in Thursday's fifth game, where his homework
put him an hour ahead on the clock and obliged the champion to concede an
18-move draw as White, was there a glimmer of hope.
Kasparov is confident, even patronising at the post-game press conferences
which Short never attends after a defeat. Kasparov claims that the Briton
has big psychological problems and lacks the experience for a world
championship. This is from a man aged 30 talking about a rival aged 28.
The Times has put up a prize fund of Pounds 1.7m, the largest ever purse for
British sport outside boxing. Costs of administration and a publicity
campaign are estimated at between Pounds 1m and Pounds 5m. At first the
newspaper expected to recoup much of its outlay through sales of tickets at
between Pounds 45 and Pounds 150. A full house for every game in the
1,000-seat Savoy Theatre would have raised Pounds 2m. But two months before
the match, sales figures were disastrous in spite of campaigns on LBC radio
 -'It's war on 7 September' - and on London buses - 'Only room for one on
top'.
The minimum seat price was reduced to Pounds 20, and there were special
Pounds 10 offers to readers of the News of the World 'the newspaper most
read by chessplayers' and The Sun. Prices could fall again if Short keeps
losing. Audiences for the first four games were between 500 and 800, but
fell to about 300 on Thursday. At the last title match in New York in 1990
seat prices were Dollars 50 at the start, yet near the end tickets were
given away to schoolchildren.
Channel 4 bought the television rights and is screening two hours a day.
BBC2 is devoting only half an hour with no live pictures or Kasparov
interviews, but has better graphics and less frenetic commentaries than C4's
soccer-style approach. Both channels attracted encouraging audiences of
nearly 1m for their early programmes, but Kasparov's current pace would
crush Short and reach a winning score of 12 1/2 points after only 16 or 18
games. Normal championship matches stop when one player reaches a winning
score, but The Times has said all 24 games will be played.
Nicholas Chesworth, of the event organisers CPMA who took over marketing the
match in July, is considering a switch to rapid chess, at one hour for all
the moves, to maintain interest.
In 1921 Lasker conceded a best of eight wins match to Capablanca when the
score was 0-4 and Robert Huebner, one of Short's aides, twice withdrew from
candidates matches. But at Pounds 60 a move and with a contract to honour,
Short would have to be broken by continued defeats to take such a course,
and as of this weekend he looks resilient.
Jan Timman trails Anatoly Karpov 2 1/2 -3 1/2 at the rival Fide championship
in the Netherlands, which has attracted audiences of nearly 1,000, even
though both contestants were earlier defeated by Short. All the Pounds
900,000 prize money for Timman and Karpov is being provided by the Sultan of
Oman. Oman will stage the second half of the match when, it is said, only
the grandmasters and the royal family will be allowed into the playing hall.
Money is always a problem in chess. Most professionals only scrape a living.
It is a perennial struggle to conjure up commercial support for chess in
Britain. Many British players play for French, Belgian or Dutch clubs at
weekends. This year a UK club league has begun, but it has only six teams
and has yet to prove its viability.
In contrast, Kasparov has earned Pounds 2.8m in his career, from
tournaments, matches and simultaneous exhibitions against amateurs where his
normal fee is Pounds 20,000. Short has so far won Pounds 150,000 from world
championship qualifiers, and however badly he is crushed at the Savoy, will
pick up Pounds 637,500 as loser.
Two world championships and two rival organisations in chess have caused
dissension among the top players. Short and Kasparov broke with Fide, the
governing body of world chess, after it awarded the match to Manchester's
Pounds 1.2m bid. Short claimed he was not consulted. Kasparov, who had long
disliked Fide and its president Florencio Campomanes, jumped at the chance
to create the Professional Chess Association after the two players had
turned down an increased Manchester offer.
Along with the PCA, a new name has come to the fore in international chess.
Bob Rice, a New York tax lawyer, opened a small chess club in Wall Street
and found a shoal of investment brokers and bankers keen to play. One of his
legal clients was Kasparov, so Rice, a relaxed and entertaining man, emerged
as Commissioner of the PCA, registered in Delaware like the tennis and golf
professional groups on which it is modelled.
Rice says the PCA is not a rival to Fide. 'We are a professional
organisation to help chess players,' he says. 'Fide will continue to do what
it always has, for amateur players around the world.'
Others view it differently. John Nunn, the respected UK grandmaster, fears
that the PCA will fail and that hardliners in Fide will then overturn
reforms which have allowed players to become more involved. Nunn believes
that Kasparov lacks business sense he says the champion promised, but failed
to deliver, US and Japanese sponsors.
A critical test for the PCA is its Groningen qualifier in December for its
1995 title match. Many grandmasters will enter, though there will also be
significant absentees. The prize fund is Pounds 150,000, but no sponsor has
been announced. Some in the chess world believe that The Times has an
exclusive agreement with the PCA until the end of the London match, and that
the Groningen sponsor will then be revealed as Intel, the microprocessor
maker.
Back at the Savoy, Short needs to avoid a wipeout, stabilise the score with
a series of draws, then dig into his reserves of courage. The hype and
controversy has been more of a strain for him than for the ebullient
Kasparov, and the chess schism has made some of his old friends among
players unwilling to help him.
Many believe that he would have put up a better fight, and safeguarded his
chess future, if he had accepted Manchester's offer. The jury is also out on
whether Kasparov v Short will stimulate British chess by attracting players
or will damage it by discouraging sponsors who see only huge costs and
uncertain returns. Perhaps this controversial match will do both.

FT  18 SEP 93 / How we saved the rhino with rifle and chainsaw: Elizabeth
Robinson watches a desperate attempt to beat the poachers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELIZABETH ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONVOY giving chase through the African bush was an assortment of
pick-ups, a Land Rover and trucks all being directed by a crackled message
from a scout helicopter, call sign Z-HOT.
Trackers had scoured the earth for clues and reported to the helicopter.
When the animal came within 30m of the chopper - the range of the full-bore
air pressure rifle on board - it was shot. In many cases, mothers and their
young were felled within metres of each other; sometimes the baby panicked,
ran off and collapsed as far as a mile from where its mother lay.
Rhino hunting in Zimbabwe has found new impetus. But take heart - these are
hunts to save the lives of a vanishing species, performed by vets using
sleep-inducing darts, not the AKs of the poachers. Poaching has wiped out
all but - at an optimistic estimate - 500 of Zimbabwe's rhinos; four years
ago there were more than 2,000.
The hunter's aim in both cases is the same: to remove the rhino's horn. A
successful poacher will get less than Pounds 100 for the horn, which is then
sold for as much as Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 13,000) in the Far East where it
is thought to enhance sexual potency, or to Yemen to be made into highly
prized dagger handles. A successful vet will hope that the dehorned rhino
has been given a stay of execution.
Zimbabwe has been dehorning its rhino population for a year, following the
example of Namibia. Mark Atkinson, a vet for Zimbabwe's National Parks
working almost exclusively on the dehorning programme, believes about 60 per
cent of Zimbabwe's rhino population has been dehorned.
He stresses that the programme is not a long-term solution to save the
rhino, but prefers to call it 'crisis management'. In other words, the vets
are trying to give the rhinos a respite from poachers so that the species
can build its numbers up to a comfortable level. By dehorning the few left,
the species may survive.
It costs between Dollars 500 and Dollars 1,000 to dehorn one rhino. It can
also take several days to track one animal, and a dozen or more burly men to
heave the captured rhino into a crate for transportation to a safer area.
With no dedicated rhino unit in Zimbabwe, the conservationists are desperate
for any help they can get. The British Army's Mozambique Training Team,
based in the east of the country, has been lending radios, trucks and muscle
to Zimbabwe's effort. They helped to move seven rhinos at Lake Kyle which
had been stranded when the rains came, and took part in a three-week
operation to dehorn about 60 animals in the Bushey Park area.
Under Lt Col Robert Martin, officers and senior NCOs from BMATT (British
Military Advisory and Training Team) joined the veterinarian team and
trackers at a private game lodge about three hours south of Harare. The vets
particularly wanted help in dehorning and moving the white rhinos, which are
more susceptible to stress than black ones.
Once the trackers and vets have sighted and shot a rhino, the convoy of
trucks with its winches and crates rushed to where the animal lay. A hood
was placed over the rhino's head to shield its eyes and ears. The removal of
the horn takes only a few minutes. Chainsaws cut through it as easily as
through a small tree; the vet takes longer to shape the stump so that it
will not become ingrown. Rhino horns regrow at an average of 8cm a year.
Small slivers of horn are barely distinguishable from a human fingernail.
Part of the exercise was to move the rhinos to a safer area - private
gameparks or farms. A truck winched down a crate to lie with its open door
facing the rhino and a rope was tied around the animal's huge snout. About
eight soldiers took up positions around the animal to push it into the
crate, while as many again were at the back of the crate ready to heave on
the rope and pull the rhino in.
Rather than shift two to three tons of deadweight, the animal was revived
with a sleeping drug antidote and water was poured into its ear to wake it.
As soon as it started moving, the heaving and pushing began until the door
of the crate was closed on a very irate and confused beast.
The crate was then winched on to the truck and the rhinos driven to a secret
location where they are released into a corral and monitored before being
taken to a safe area.
There are so few rhinos left that the vets keep detailed identification
details of each one they catch. As well as nicks cut out of their ears, age,
condition and distinguishing marks being noted, 'mug shots' are taken.
Seven rhinos were dehorned that weekend - one calf, at four to six months
old, had no horn to speak of.
Euan Anderson, a Zimbabwean vet, believes that since the dehorning programme
started in Zimbabwe, four to five dehorned rhinos have been killed by
poachers. This may be because when poachers have spent several days
following rhino spoor they may kill the animal to cut off its ears as proof
to their paymasters, or it may simply be that the poachers were not aware
until after the shooting that the rhino they had been following was carrying
nothing of value. To combat the latter, Zimbabwe has been advertising its
dehorning programme on Zambian television - it is believed that the poachers
come from Zambia, though some have hinted that the worst culprits are much
closer to the Zimbabwe parks.
Studies are in progress in Namibia and Zimbabwe to determine the long-term
effect on the rhino's behaviour of having its horn removed. Euan Anderson
believes that the rhino is not greatly affected. Even in self defence, as he
says, if a three-ton beast charges towards impact at full speed, it does not
much matter whether it has a horn or not.
More than one of the officers involved in the rescue observed that 'Civvies
would pay a fortune to do this'. Indeed, I felt privileged to be there to
see the magnificent animals sleeping, touch their skin that feels like
slightly spongy granite and stroke their ears, which on black rhinos are
fringed with long silky black hairs.
Zimbabwe had, in fact, investigated the possibility of selling 'rhino
hunting', particularly to the US. The idea was that for around Dollars
30,000 a hunter would be given the facilities to track and dart a rhino,
leaving the vets to do the rest, and take home the horn as a souvenir.
However, the proposal met with outcry and resistance in the US. Another idea
that the vets approve of is to flood the market with the huge stockpile of
legally-removed rhino horn, force down the market price and thus make
poaching unviable. They stipulate, however, that the revenues should be
ploughed back into rhino conservation.
Bushmen and vets in Zimbabwe are passionate in their commitment in saving
the rhino from extinction. While Mark Atkinson was busy with the chainsaw, a
vet from the US whispered: 'Your gardeners in England earn more than he
does.'
Earlier, on a walking safari deep in the bush of Hwange National Park, I was
nervously quizzing my armed guide about the procedure should an animal
charge (do not shoot until it is 10 feet away and approaching). And what if
your party of tourists should be charged by a rhino? I asked. He shrugged.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (7): An ill-fit for the
rich - Pensions, The earnings cap / The implications of the obstacle for
high-flyers' retirement aspirations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS ago, the government decided it would limit the subsidies it would
provide for the pensions of the truly wealthy.
Lord Lawson, in his memoirs, records the outcry over the so-called earnings
cap - second in volume perhaps only to that over the suggestion that
pensioners should no longer be allowed to take a portion of their retirement
benefits in a tax-free lump sum.
But the policy has remained, and increasing numbers of highly paid
individuals are having to seek alternative tax-beneficial ways to provide
additional income in their retirement.
The earnings cap was first set at Pounds 60,000 in 1989, meaning that an
employee could save enough money to entitle him to a pension of up to Pounds
40,000. After much debate, it was decided that the cap would rise annually,
but only in line with inflation as measured by the Retail Price Index.
Because national average earnings rise by 2 to 2.5 percentage points a year
faster than RPI, the industry calculated that, even those on relatively
modest earnings, could find themselves up against the earnings cap at some
point in the future. At that point they lose the tax advantages if they make
any further pension provision. High-flyers, who, through rapid promotion,
experience much larger pay rises, are likely to bump up against the cap even
more quickly.
Price Waterhouse estimates that a 40-year-old high-flying executive on the
relatively modest salary of Pounds 28,200 will bump up against the earnings
cap before reaching retirement age if his pay outstrips RPI by 4 percentage
points a year.
Things appeared even more ominous earlier this year, when the then
chancellor, Norman Lamont, citing the UK's low inflation rate, said the
earnings cap for the 1993-94 fiscal year would be frozen at Pounds 75,000,
and would not be allowed to rise to Pounds 77,400 as had been planned.
'This is the thin end of the wedge,' said Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the
National Association of Pension Funds and pension and benefits manager at
Grand Metropolitan. The NAPF fears that the move will provide a precedent
for future chancellors seeking to raise cash by taxing the well-off.
But for all the anxiety, relatively few people have been affected so far.
That is because the limit only applies to members of occupational schemes
set up after March 14, 1989 or those people who joined existing schemes
after June 1, 1989.
'The sort of people who have been affected are those who are high earners
and who were recruited by head hunters to responsible positions since 1989,'
said Geoffrey Calvert, tax consultant at Price Waterhouse. Employers who
wished to attract and retain such people have had to figure out how to make
a pensions promise that the individual will regard as iron-clad. 'The issue
for the employee is one of security. They will want a funded promise,' Mr
Calvert said.
Because contributions attract no tax relief, anyone whose employer makes one
on his behalf will be hit with a tax bill for 40 per cent of the sum. Rather
than ask employees to take such a hit, some employers have been relying on
unfunded promises - that is, promising to pay the pension out of current
income when it falls due at some future date.
Stewart Ritchie, director of pensions at Scottish Equitable, said that
high-flyers can sometimes have their pension needs addressed by making
modifications to the existing scheme. For instance, it is typical for
employees to accrue 1/60th of their final pension entitlement for each year
of employment. After 40 years of service, a full two-thirds pension is
earned.
But Inland Revenue limits allow schemes to grant as much as 1/30th of final
pension accrual in each year. 'An individual earning Pounds 150,000 will be
able to accrue as much pension entitlement each year in a 1/30th scheme as
an individual earning Pounds 75,000 in a 1/60th scheme,' Mr Ritchie says.
Thus, depending on how much previous pension benefit the high-flyer has
accrued, employers may be able to find tax relief for pension contributions
simply by setting up a new scheme with a faster annual accrual rate.
Alternatively, the scheme may establish a separate section which accrues
benefits more quickly.
But for those who cannot take advantage of such a device, or those who are
not satisfied with unfunded benefits, the pensions industry has been
perfecting Furbs - the Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme. Unlike
unapproved company schemes, there are no limits on the level of pension
benefits or lump-sum payments that can be provided.
Furbs will never offer the tax advantages of pension arrangements before the
earnings cap was set in place. But it can mitigate some of the more onerous
tax consequences, while offering greater flexibility in the payment of
pension benefits. 'You can retire at 45 if you want to,' Mr Ritchie said.
According to Price Waterhouse, Furbs become attractive when contributions
are likely to exceed Pounds 100,000 in total over the first two to three
years of contributions.
Furbs work like this: the high-flyer earns tax relief on pension
contributions up to the ceiling under the earnings cap. The employer then
makes the additional necessary contributions, which would attract a tax
charge on the employee as a benefit-in-kind. But typically, the employer
will pay the high-flyer's tax charge, treating it as a normal business
expense for his own tax purposes. Furbs offer an additional advantage to
employers, because contributions do not attract the National Insurance
contribution, currently at 9.25 per cent of full pay. The NIC savings thus
offsets some of the employer's pension expense.
The funds are then usually invested in an onshore trust, which attracts tax
at the basic-rate of 25 per cent on capital gains and 20 per cent on
dividend income. Alternatively, funds may be invested in an offshore trust,
which attracts no tax in certain cases. However, Mr Ritchie warns that the
Inland Revenue may not allow the tax advantages of offshore investments to
remain forever if it perceives that they are being widely exploited.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: On the track of crooked dealers -
Clive Fewins talks to an international private investigator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MANY bars and night clubs in the far east almost every other bottle of
spirits sold is a counterfeit, according to international investigator Wayne
Grant.
'The usual trick is to supply the first bottle of the correct spirits -
usually a brand of cognac. Then when the clients have had plenty to drink
and they order another the bartenders substitute a bottle of cheap brandy
made in Cyprus, Spain or elsewhere in a bottle expertly disguised as the
real thing,' said Grant.
Grant International tracks down the counterfeiters and supplies the
appropriate law enforcement agency with enough information to apprehend
them.
It is a highly specialised - and often dangerous - task, but one to which
Grant, a 6ft 2ins 19-stone former Thames Valley Police detective - is well
suited.
'When I entered the force as a 19 year-old 29 years ago I had absolutely no
idea that I would end up controlling a company with a turnover of Pounds
1.8m and a staff of 85,' Grant said.
'In many ways I still do not regard myself as a particularly good
businessman. It just so happened that I was fascinated with the process of
investigation, and when I was offered the chance to come out of the force at
the age of 31 and join an international cigarette company as a security
specialist it was an offer I couldn't refuse.
'After that it was a matter of luck, and the fact that to do my job well I
had to build up a bank of information that has subsequently proved valuable
to many major manufacturers of the world's fastest moving commodities.' That
information has been the key to the Grant success story.
Grant stayed with Rothmans for four years. During that time he decided to
form his own specialised international investigation agency.
In 1980 Grant used half his Pounds 3,000 severance pay to travel to the US
and sign two cigarette companies as his first clients. Grant International
now has more than 60 clients in various industries who pay retainers ranging
from Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 70,000 a year.
In that first year Grant calculates that he travelled round the world 20
times, while his wife Carole dealt with the administration from the family
home in Bicester.
Turnover in the first year was Pounds 187,000, of which more than half was
profit. It was achieved not only through negotiating retainers but also
through much directed (specific investigations) work.
It was a good beginning - and gave Grant a cash base on which to build the
company.
'The main problem in that year was keeping up with my sleep, and explaining
to my bank, in what was then a small country town, why I had such a huge
appetite for cash,' Grant said. Even in those days one week's travel budget
could total as much as Pounds 10,000.
As most of the international companies he was trading with paid on a 60-day
basis Grant International had cash flow problems in the early years. 'Once
the bank realised just exactly what I was doing it as good as gold,' Grant
said. 'Unlike many small businessmen I can honestly say I have experienced
nothing but help from my bank, Lloyds.'
Turnover roughly doubled in each of the first 10 years, but growth has
tailed off slightly since 1989.
'For the past four years we have added roughly Pounds 100,000 to our
turnover each year, which our accountant says is very satisfactory,' said
Grant. 'Our profit before tax in our last trading year was Pounds 550,000 on
a turnover of Pounds 1.8m.'
Grant said the slowdown was not due to the recession, but because in some
sectors he had reached saturation point.
It is possible to expand, however, by undertaking more directed work for
individual clients. This is because counterfeiting is a growth industry,
particularly since the opening up of the former the USSR.
Grant International works for all the 28 largest liquor producers in the
world and for most of the large cigarette manufacturers.
The biggest decision each year is which industries to enter to expand the
Grant operation. This year the new industry was food. There was also an
expansion of work for manufacturers of crystal jewellery.
In both industries the growing problem is not so much one of counterfeiting
as one of the 'grey market,' otherwise known as parallel trading. Many large
producers export the same goods at different prices to different countries.
But this means that local traders can, often quite legally, divert the goods
and make a profit. 'For many years this has been a big problem with
industries such as tobacco, drinks and confectionery, all of which depend on
a high volume and comparatively low price products,' Grant said.
The task for Grant International therefore is to pinpoint the 'culprits' and
advise client companies of ways of overcoming the leakage.
Grant has paid employees and contract staff in some 30 countries who act,
chiefly, as intelligence gatherers.
'A very high proportion of the work is the stuff of which day-to-day
detective work is made from: hard, intelligent, day-to-day grind, with the
spark and the inspiration to know when to act on a hunch,' Grant said. 'Six
of our 15 headquarters staff in Bicester and a good proportion of our
overseas employees are former police. There is nothing quite like a police
training in this sort of work.'
Grant has been present at a dozen or so big raids, but many of his staff
never see such drama. Their lives are spent on the end of a phone or at a
computer screen, talking to and paying local contacts and analysing data
such as export statistics, a surprising amount of which is public
information - if you know where to find it.
Nevertheless there can be risks. Two years ago two of his investigators were
killed and a third seriously injured in Mexico when a lorry drove into their
car on a mountain road. They were investigating a swindle involving the
resale of cheap white rum.
Grant's nightmare is the unsuccessful raid. 'The worst thing I can imagine
is spending tens of thousands of pounds of clients' money, involving the
local police and customs authorities, only to go in and find it's the
genuine stuff,' he said.
'But I would be very surprised if it happened. We proudly proclaim that we
have bought a successful outcome to every enquiry bought to us. But we could
be set up. It is a good reason for remaining on our toes ...'

FT  18 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Artist who followed his muse to
success - Ann Marriott meets a potter who would not compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANN MARRIOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH a turn of his potter's wheel, artist Martin Homer left behind a
lucrative business supplying London's top stores for a creative independence
in rural Worcestershire.
Having reached an enviable position in a tough creative market, Martin
swapped it all for a one-man concern centred on a school for potters based
at his oast-house home.
'I make what I like and hope somebody else will like it too,' he said. The
same philosophy - artistic integrity versus market necessity - has doubtless
driven many small businesses to the wall. But Martin's tale is one of
success.
In the mid-1970s he led a team of potters supplying Liberty's but quit to
concentrate on his own creative work, which he sold through his own shop. It
proved to be an excellent choice. His job satisfaction increased, sales
turnover doubled within two years and profits benefitted from dispensing
with middlemen.
After Martin left Birmingham Art School at 20 in 1965, he supplemented what
he earnt from selling pots with part-time teaching. For 20 years he taught
at Walsall Art College in the West Midlands. During that time he established
himself as a potter. An important early step was to find an agent who
secured an entree to Liberty's.
Martin's first workshop was in the dining room of the tiny cottage that he
and his wife Tina rented for Pounds 1 a week in the late 1960s. Later he
moved his kiln to a lean-to shed he erected himself with materials provided
by a friend.
In 1970 he rented a bigger workshop in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, for
Pounds 1 per week from a local ceramics enthusiast. As the business, which
he called Workshop 20, expanded Martin took on two assistants.
By 1980 Martin knew he would have to simplify his production process and
standardise his products to keep up with demand. He was unwilling to make
this creative sacrifice, so he called a halt. His remaining assistant was
ready to form his own business and Workshop 20 closed.
In 1976 Martin had opened a shop in Ludlow, called the Potters Shop, with
another potter. Each potter sells only his own work, each has his own space
and they keep separate books but all expenses are shared.
'Owning the shop gave me the freedom to make expensive, creative pieces.
When I was wholesaling, shops just wanted standard ranges of mugs and jugs,'
Martin said. His clientele has built steadily and buys items as works of
art. 'If anyone needs a jug, they can go round the corner to Woolworths and
buy one. They buy mine because it is an individual, hand-made piece,' Martin
said.
His work, which ranges from Pounds 3 to Pounds 300, is hand thrown. He still
makes jugs, each with their own character and ranging 'from the fat,
pot-bellied to the tall and sensuous'.
His speciality is a technique known as 'sprigging', which dates from the
17th century. The sprigs - clay pictures in relief that are made from
traditional moulds ranging from geese, rabbits and mice to a stylised sun
and ears of corn - are stuck to biscuit-fired pots with liquid clay. They
adorn mugs, jugs, butter and cheese dishes and bread crocks.
In 1977, flush with the success of the shop, Martin and Tina bought a
converted oast house in a state of disrepair and a sitting tenant. A small
payment gave them vacant possession and in 1979 they moved in and started
the renovation project.
The house gave the couple a second string to their bow - it is big enough to
run summer art schools. These started immediately in 1979 - 'We fed them
well and they didn't mind the absence of window sills,' Tina said.
The summer schools offer courses for eight potters and 10 painters at a
time. A garden producing organically grown vegetables helps provide lunch
for the group, which is billeted with local families. Courses cost Pounds
269 inclusive a week. Between them the two businesses provide a comfortable
living for a family of five.
Martin teaches the potters and hires tutors for the art students. The school
attracts foreign students for courses of varying length. 'Lots of people
come year after year and become good friends,' Martin said.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (6): Swiss mystique fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO DOUBT a Swiss bank account still has a cachet all of its own. But as with
many hoary traditional things, the reality no longer coincides with the
myth.
There has ceased to be any point in having a Swiss numbered account operated
anonymously for you by a lawyer, for example. Swiss law requires that a bank
know the identity of the beneficial owner of all its accounts.
It also requires that the bank disclose the identity in the event of
criminal inquiries, and it authorises bank directors to inform the
authorities if they are suspicious that the account is being used for
something illegal. (The Swiss are now discussing making this latter practice
obligatory.)
Some Swiss banks now play down the importance of secrecy in marketing their
services to high net worth individuals.
And that leads to a second misapprehension among potential clients. Time was
that Swiss banks actually charged foreigners a fee on deposits  - in other
words, a negative interest rate. No longer. They are now as eager to attract
deposits as any other bank, and pay reasonable interest rates, too.
So why bother having a Swiss bank account?
In general, there is not much of a case for it. If you have frequent
business in Switzerland or in Swiss francs, then a Swiss franc account will
undoubtedly be useful. But these days, most international banks will offer
accounts in all major currencies, so there is no obvious need to go to a
Swiss bank.
And even if you spend a lot of time in Switzerland, it may not be wise to
put your money in a Swiss franc account. The Swiss franc also has a slightly
outdated reputation for being firm and stable. Although it is going through
a good patch at the moment, its performance in the past decade has been
among the least impressive of major currencies.
If you are thinking of stuffing some money away for retirement, then
certainly the big Swiss banks are among the strongest in the world. Indeed,
among the world's top 15 banks, Union Bank of Switzerland has by far the
best tier one capital ratio (7 per cent).
However, even though they pay reasonable interest rates, the banks are
obliged to extract a 35 per cent withholding tax from earned interest.
Switzerland has double taxation treaties with most countries so you can get
it back, but it is a nuisance.
A secondary, but nevertheless important, consideration is that the Swiss are
still extremely careful and competent bankers. One does not need to worry
about funds being misplaced or transfers going astray when dealing with
them.
Finally, even though bank secrecy has eroded considerably, the Swiss still
cling tenaciously to a few elements of it. They will not co-operate at all
with foreign governments' tax investigations, and they will not help an
ex-spouse trying to get his or her share of a family fortune.
For most people, however, these considerations do not apply. Thus, to get
the best of Swiss banking without the possible disadvantages, it might be
best to take out an account with a reputable Swiss bank in your home
currency and in your home country.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (4): Everything under one
roof - Private banking / The implications of high street banks' entry into a
hitherto exclusive sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION IS entering the genteel world of private banking, a market
increasingly coveted by providers of financial services as a relatively
risk-free way of selling services and products lucratively.
The high street banks have begun to invade territory mainly at the expense
of the traditional private banks. In July, Adam &amp; Co, an Edinburgh-based
private bank, was taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland. Earlier this year,
Barclays launched a private banking arm in Mayfair, to cater to the
investment needs of those with Pounds 500,000 or more in liquid assets.
Lloyds' private banking arm, launched in 1985, adopted a different strategy
from other private banks by requiring a minimum of only Pounds 75,000 of
disposable assets from its customers.
'The attraction of private banking for UK banks such as Lloyds and Barclays
is that it is almost exclusively asset management,' said Peter Kinahan,
editor of Private Banker International, a newsletter published by Lafferty.
'It does not tie up capital, it is non-lending and is very profitable for
the banks which get it right.'
Coutts and Lloyds are the two largest players in the UK market. Coutts,
perhaps the best-known name in private banking because of its association
with the royal family, has Pounds 6bn of client funds under management,
while Lloyds has Pounds 4.1bn, according to Datamonitor. Barings, Hill
Samuel and Guinness Mahon merchant banks are the next largest players.
Private banking originally offered wealthy investors a safe deposit for
their funds, with the possibility of loans. Today, increased demand for
investment advice and fund management has broadened the range of services,
until they are similar to those offered by other institutions such as
merchant banks or stockbrokers that have private banking arms.
Services include discretionary portfolio management, money market accounts,
trust management, insurance, school fees planning and tax advice, though
each bank is likely to have its own definition of what a private banking
service should offer.
'Private banking is not a defined set of services,' said Ian Woodhouse,
private banking consultant with Price Waterhouse Management Consultants. 'It
is a personalised service oriented towards investment.'
The emphasis in all cases is on the customer-banker relationship. 'We will
handle anything relating to our customers' financial affairs including
buying them a vintage car,' said Michael Maslinski, head of business
development, at Coutts private bank, speaking of the Campbell's Office, the
integrated financial and banking service offered to very high net worth
individuals.
Flexibility is also a defining characteristic. The minimum level of assets
can range between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 1m, depending on the bank, but
you could still be accepted with nothing like this amount if you are the son
or daughter of a valued customer.
The same flexibility extends to charges. Private banking's bread and butter
comes from fee-based services, such as investment advice and moving money
between countries. But what you pay depends on how frequently you use the
services and the size of your portfolio. Charges are usually negotiable if
your portfolio is large.
'In the past, customers would not question the fees, but now prices tend to
be broken down so that you know how much you are paying for individual
services,' said Woodhouse. 'Whereas there used to be a fee for the overall
service, the tendency now is to make a charge for the service used.'
You may, however, be paying over the odds for personalised service. For
example, at Coutts, the basic banking service comes free only if you
maintain an average minimum of Pounds 3,000 in your account, otherwise there
is a quarterly charge of Pounds 30.
However, James Cooper, chief executive of Lloyds private banking, argues
that it can be cheaper to have all your financial needs managed in one
place. 'We charge a fee of 1 per cent for assets under management; you might
find yourself paying more by going to a series of advisers or fund
managers.' He says another advantage is that the charge for financial advice
can often be rolled into the fund mangement fees.
Assuming you have sufficient assets, why go to a private bank rather than an
investment house, stockbroker or a series of specialists, such as a
financial adviser and an accountant?
Cooper argues that the great attraction is the ability to have your banking
and other financial needs, including tax affairs, administered through the
private banking executive appointed for each customer. Other advantages are
enhanced banking facilities: the Lloyds service offers an automatic
borrowing facility of Pounds 17,500 at preferential rates of interest, as
well as a Pounds 500 daily cashpoint limit and a cheque guarantee card for
Pounds 250.
Woodhouse says that the form of assets you hold determines to a large extent
the type of bank you need. 'If your assets are mainly liquid, on deposits or
in bonds, there are banks which specialise in this. If your assets are
predominantly in securities, you'll look for a securities-oriented
institution with a global network. But if your assets are mainly in
property, you might choose a property/tax adviser.'

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (5): Expatriates can roll
it up offshore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS WHO wish to keep their assets on deposit, but who are expatriates
or intend to move abroad, might consider offshore funds as an alternative to
holding money in a UK-based bank or building society, writes Scheherazade
Daneshkhu.
Many are similar to unit trusts; but, unlike their onshore counterparts,
offshore funds can pay income gross (though November's Budget may bring
change).
Offshore funds are broadly divided into two main types for UK tax purposes:
distributor and accumulator funds. Distributors must pay out 85 per cent of
their income as dividends. UK investors pay income tax on the dividends, but
any other profits are taxed as capital gains.
Accumulators do not pay out income, but 'roll it up' within the fund. Gains
are taxed as income, not capital gains, but only when investors sell their
holding. Accumulator funds can, therefore, be useful for postponing a tax
liability. If an investor knew he was going to retire and move into a lower
tax bracket, he could invest in a roll-up and take profits at the most
tax-efficient moment.
Furthermore, the roll-up can enhance performance. Since tax is postponed,
investors can compound their investment gross rather than net. Roll-up funds
tend to invest in the money markets, or in bonds, where income is high
enough to get the full benefit of the roll-up process.
Many investment houses offer a range of funds, allowing investors to switch
easily between cash, bonds and equities without incurring the same costs as
moving between different institutions. Investors can also switch between
currencies.

Could you please clarify the position for a private individual, with regard
to buying and selling shares on the stock exchange through a stockbroker?
I understand that losses may be offset against gains, in a financial year;
but are the brokers' charges for buying and selling, and stamp duty costs,
allowed to be deducted from any profits arising in individual share
transactions.
Yes, by virtue of section 38(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Can you tell me if it is strictly necessary to give details on a tax return
of share disposals exceeding Pounds 11,600 in a tax year even though capital
gains do not exceed Pounds 5,800?
It seems rather pointless. If so will the Inland Revenue require copies of
the relevant sale contract?
I have a number of sales where I am only part of a group sale (to save
commission) although contracts are in my name, or in joint names with my
wife. 1) Yes; subsection 6(b) of section 3 of the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992 only lets you off the hook (subject to your tax inspector's
tacit consent) if 'the aggregate amount or value of the consideration for
all disposals made by (you) (other than disposals, gains accruing on which
are not chargeable gains) does not exceed an amount equal to twice the
exempt amount for the year'.
2) No, probably not (although the inspector has the right to ask, if he or
she wishes to check the facts stated in your tax return).

FT  18 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wrong end of the stick
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been living and working outside the UK, principally in Spain, for the
past seven years.
I intend to invest in the UK stock markets and as a non-resident, I presume
I would be exempt from UK income tax but would I also be exempt from capital
gains tax?
If I am not exempt from capital gains tax, how would it be collected? Would
it be in the form of a with-holding tax or a demand at the end of the tax
year?
You have got hold of the wrong end of the stick. People who are neither
resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK are exempt from capital gains
tax, but are not exempt from income arising in the UK.
As a non-resident Commonwealth citizen, however, you are entitled to a full
personal allowance (currently Pounds 3,445 for a single person born after
April 5 1929).
As a resident of Spain, you cannot be charged more than 12 per cent UK
income tax on interest.
Also, as a Spanish resident you will be entitled to a minimum payment of a
quarter of the one-quarter tax credit which each UK dividend carries: this
leaves you with a maximum effective UK income tax rate of 15 per cent on the
aggregate of each dividend and its tax credit.
The Spanish tax authorities will allow credit for that residual 15 per cent
UK tax against your Spanish tax liability on the aggregate figures;
similarly they will allow credit for the 12 per cent UK tax when calculating
your Spanish tax bill on any UK interest.
Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand,
London UK WC2R 1LB, for a copy of the free booklet IR20 (Residents and
nonresidents: liability to tax in the UK).
Presumably copies of the Spain-UK double taxation convention are obtainable
locally: the relevant articles are 11 for interest, 10(3) for dividends and
24(2)(a) for credit against your Spanish tax liabilities.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT and my accountant's fees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recently I have used my accountant to calculate Capital Gains Tax liability
before making sales of investments, in order to avoid incurring tax.
Owing to a miscalculation in one case a small liability has, in fact, been
incurred.
When I suggested to my accountant that his charge for this service could be
offset against this liability he said that: 'Section 32(2) of the CGTA 1979
relates to professional fees relating to acquisition and disposal of assets
and not the calculation for tax purposes.'
It seems to me that when I sought my accountant's advice on the gains
position before selling, this 'related to disposal of assets'. I should be
grateful for your comment on this.
Your accountant's fees, including VAT, will be deductible in calculating the
chargeable gains or allowable losses to the extent that they relate to
'making any valuation or apportionment required for the purposes of the
computation of the gain (or loss), including in particular . . .
ascertaining market value where required', by virtue of section 38(2)(b) of
the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (which reenacts section 32(2)(b)
of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979).
So, if you simply bought a parcel of shares after April 5 1982 and sold the
entire holding, no part of your accountant's fee for doing the CGT
calculation would be allowable.
This is because he would not have had to do any apportioning or any
ascertaining of market values.
If you bought any shares before April 6 1982, on the other hand, his fee
would be allowable to the extent that it covered the time which he spent
looking up the March 31 1982 value in one of the books of prices for CGT
purposes.
If you sold only part of a holding, his fee would be allowable to the extent
that it covered the time which he spent in apportioning the base cost
between the shares sold and the remaining balance; and so on.
If your accountant uses a computer service to calculate his client's CGT
gains and losses, then the appropriate portion of his fee will be deductible
from the figures produced by the computer (unless of course the computer
program takes his prospective fees into account).
The rules are quite arbitrary, as you see, like many - perhaps most - of the
rules of capital gains tax: it is futile to try to discern any logical basis
for Parliament's decision on which expenses should be allowable.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Storm clouds over shares - Diary of
a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON October 15 and 16 1987, gale force winds wreaked havoc in my garden in
Dorset, southern England. Trees were ripped up, branches crashed down. On
October 19 that year the New York Dow Jones Index plummeted 508 points; in
London the FTSE 100 share index fell 250 points. It subsequently fell
further.
On October 20, 1989 gale force winds wrenched branches from my trees. But
the stock market 'mini crash' that year started on October 13.
Last Sunday (September 12) gale force winds again damaged to the trees in my
garden. So will the stock market fall? Or has the 'crisis' already passed.?
In 1927 women tended to favour shorter skirts than in previous years, but by
1930 day-skirts had lengthened to mid-calf or lower. The great Wall Street
crash was in 1929. During the 1968-72 period the mini-skirt was popular and
share prices boomed until the midi-skirt became the height of fashion and
the stock market plunged. Where are dress lengths now?
Skirt lengths, sun spot activity, and all sorts of other things have been
put forward by people as indications of stock market trends. Perhaps just as
valid, therefore, are the effects of gales on the south coast - or my own
discovery: the slimness connection.
Looking back in 20th-century history, whenever there has been a reaction
against ultra-thin fashion models, there has been a market downturn. Twiggy
was the world's most famous model from 1966 to 1971. When people considered
her then look to be no longer fashionable, the market went down (1973). In
1992 followers of top fashion model Kate Moss tried to emulate her physical
shape - but recently there has been much newspaper comment against the
'waif-like' look. So will the market go down if figures expand?
I am not seriously advancing gales and dress sizes as indicators of market
trends - I much prefer a closer look at market activity and general future
prospects for companies.
It was fairly easy to predict the crash of 1987 - indeed, I did so in this
column in August and October of that year. The average price earnings ratio
of US companies was then at its highest level for 26 years. I had a genuine
feeling of unease about the market, which seemed increasingly to be
influenced by rumours and by institutional investors playing 'pass the
parcel' with ever-increasingly overpriced shares: what would happen when no
one wanted the parcel?
On reflection, there was another good indicator of that crash. A bull market
is at its peak when the amount of 'bull' written about why the market will
continue to rise is also at its peak. When people seek to justify a
continuing rise in the market by looking for unusual explanations, then the
market is due for a fall.
But what of the stock market today? Many market commentators have already
stated that the US and UK markets cannot continue to rise at the same rates
as earlier in the year. Price earnings ratios have again reached record
levels. There will have to be a setback eventually - or at least a lengthy
pause on a plateau. There is much less bull talked about why the market will
rise.
I think the future direction of the market is now in the hands of margin
traders and institutional investors in the US and pensioners and the
institutions in the UK.
Many private investors in the US deal 'on margin': they pay cash for only a
part of the cost of their shares and borrow the rest from their brokers.
Comparatively low interest rates and rising share prices have made this
increasingly attractive.
But were there to be a sudden downturn in the market and/or an increase in
interest rates, some of these investors may not be able to meet their
'margin call' and their brokers would sell some of the shares they are
holding as security for the loans. This could deepen any downturn.
In the UK many pensioners have been severely affected by the drop in
interest rates on their bank and building society deposits. They have been
forced to look elsewhere for a means to achieve good returns with which they
can supplement their pensions.
Unfortunately, in a similar way that some pensioners were attracted to
Barlow Clowes for its 'higher-than-usual' returns, so they have been
beguiled by the 'attractions' of penny shares and other highly-speculative
ventures.
While a number of companies with a share price of less than, say, 35p are
safe and sound, some of them are rubbish. Increasing investment support for
this rubbish has made it overpriced rubbish. Even for some non-penny shares,
dividend yields achieved in the past may no longer be feasible and future
prospects could be grimmer than originally anticipated.
But it is the institutions which hold the key to the direction of the stock
market. In the Wall Street crash of 1987 it was discovered that the top 15
sellers on the stock market accounted for about 20 per cent of the total
sales. In the futures market, the top 10 sellers accounted for roughly 50
per cent of the business.
It therefore only takes a relatively small number of fund managers to panic
and the market will plummet, with computer traders, trackers and others
following in their wake. I wonder how many of them follow fashion trends -
or even the weather? And how many people will be unable to jump ship before
it takes on water?
I feel the private investor needs to follow the market very closely at the
moment. It may plateau-out - or it could drop sharply and suddenly. At the
time of writing, I am ready to jump at the slightest hint of trouble.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Endowment fund launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FUND which will invest in second-hand with profits endowment policies has
been launched by BZW. The structure of the fund, which will be based in
Jersey but listed on the London stock exchange, is designed to help
investors with their financial planning for items such as school fees.
The BZW endowment fund will have a 12-year life, but will distribute its
assets to investors over the last five years of its life, during 2001-2005.
These payments will be taxed as capital, not income and could be an
advantage to those who do not use their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800
in 1993-94). Such an arrangement would not be possible for an investment
trust.
The fund will buy second-hand endowments from market makers Beale Dobie and
Policy Portfolio at a discounted rate. Although bonuses on such policies are
expected to be cut again, BZW believes the fund can return 10.1 per cent per
year to investors.
This expectation is based on the assumption of a one-off 10 per cent cut in
bonuses and no growth in bonus rates thereafter.
BZW is attempting to raise Pounds 20m by offering shares at 100p each. The
shares will be payable in two instalments of 50p, with the second instalment
due in April 1994. The partly paid structure will help the fund time its
purchases of second-hand endowment policies in what is a relatively illiquid
market.
Income-seeking investors should note that the fund will pay no dividends.
The annual management charge will be 0.5 per cent and the costs of issue
around 5.5 per cent.

SIX DIRECTORS of Rathbone Brothers, the diverse financial services company,
sold shares following the announcement of interim results which were
marginally up on the same period last year.
The shares have been outperforming the market by a considerable margin over
the past year and all the directors retain considerable stakes in the
company.
Shares in Fairey Group have also been performing relatively well.
Interim results for the electronics and specialised ceramics company were
announced on September 6 and showed pre-tax profits up more than 25 per
cent.
Two directors, sold a total of 240,000 shares at 710p. Lord Gregson is left
with a holding of only 50,000, but Michael Fay retains over 150,000.
Buying has continued in Transfer Technology. In July this year five
directors bought shares at price around 512p.
This month Richard Rimington, the non-executive deputy chairman, bought
26,000 shares at 489p, more than doubling his holding.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: How to provide for a sweet life of
retirement - With many new pension schemes on offer, do not take it for
granted that your company provides the best option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE OF us who are members of company pension schemes should not assume
automatically that we are adequately provided for. The new breed of 'money
purchase' pensions includes flexible alternatives to the traditional 'final
salary' arrangement, and some of the schemes are much better than others.
To assess your money purchase company pension it is important to understand
how the different schemes operate. Traditional final salary schemes, as the
name suggests, link the value of the pension to the employee's salary at
retirement. The employer's contribution is unrestricted, while employees can
pay in up to 15 per cent of pensionable earnings per annum (restricted in
certain cases). The maximum pension is two-thirds of final salary (also
restricted in certain cases).
Death-in-service benefits of up to four times salary can be paid.
Contributions are directed into a fund which is invested to meet the
scheme's liabilities such as pensions in payment, lump sum death benefits
and preserved pensions for early leavers.
The main point to remember about final salary schemes is that the employer
bears the risk. If there is not enough money in the fund to meet
liabilities, the employer is obliged to top it up. Moreover, the pension
provides an ideal hedge against inflation through its link to final salary
as wages tend to outstrip prices.
By contrast, money purchase pensions - whether on an individual or group
basis - shift the financial risk to the individual. The contribution and
benefit rules vary but in most cases there is no central fund. Contributions
build up in individual funds and are used at retirement to purchase
annuities to provide income.
Although some money purchase schemes aim to provide a pension that is
expressed as a proportion of final salary, there is no guarantee. The level
of pension will depend on how well the money was invested, inflation, the
provider's charges and annuity rates at the time of retirement. If these
factors are unfavourable, the employer is under no obligation to top up the
pension.
If your employer provides a money purchase pension it is important to find
out if it represents good value for money and whether it needs topping up
either by increasing contributions to the main scheme or through additional
voluntary contributions. These are the relevant factors to consider: Type of
scheme
Most money purchase schemes will fall into one of three main categories.
Contracted out money purchase schemes (comps) are Inland Revenue approved
occupational pensions and as such will follow the same contribution and
benefit limits as final salary schemes. A comp scheme must have a trust deed
and rules and there must be a board of trustees who, as with final salary
schemes, must provide annual accounts and are there to protect the interests
of scheme members.
Comps are contracted out of the state earnings related pension scheme
(Serps) and receive a rebate of employee and employer national insurance
contributions.
Contracted in money purchase schemes (cimps) are similar to comps but
employees remain in Serps and the scheme provides benefits on top of the
state earnings related pension. Younger employees can join a cimp and
contract out of Serps on an individual basis using an 'appropriate' personal
pension to receive the NI rebate.
Group personal pensions (GPPs) are not occupational schemes but are simply a
series of individual personal pension plans which can be used to contract
out of Serps and to invest additional regular or single premiums to boost
the pension provided by the NI rebate. The rebate for personal pension plan
holders is marginally higher for employees over 30 compared with the rebate
available under a comps. The combined employee and employer contribution
must not exceed 17.5 per cent of earnings (more for older employees but
there are restrictions for high earners).
The retirement income provided by the personal pension is not linked to
final salary. Death in service benefits are not compulsory, although the
personal pension itself may provide a return of contributions plus interest.
Extra life assurance can be taken out to increase this benefit. Contribution
level
This is where you start to separate the wheat from the chaff. Money purchase
schemes can match or even exceed final salary pensions provided enough
contributions are paid. Unfortunately, these arrangements have earned a
reputation for giving employers a cheap alternative to final salary schemes
and in some cases the combined employer/employee contribution is too low to
provide an adequate pension.
Actuaries at Godwins, the employee benefits consultants, provided the
following approximate guide to the total combined contributions needed to
match a typical final salary scheme. Between the ages of 21-34, total
contributions should be 7 per cent; ages 35-44 9 per cent; ages 45-54 11 per
cent; ages 55-63 15 per cent.
The 'typical' final salary for this purpose is one where the pension builds
up at a rate of one sixtieth of final salary for each year of service,
allows for 5 per cent annual increases to the pension and provides a
spouse's pension of 50 per cent. Death in service benefits would vary
according to the type of scheme but as a rule of thumb, in order to achieve
a benefit of three to four times salary you should add 1 per cent to 1.5 per
cent to the above figures.
Clive Grimley, senior manager at consultants Gissings, said:
'Contribution-matching in money purchase schemes is a valuable feature. The
scheme basis might, for example, require a contribution of 5 per cent from
both employer and employee. On top of this some employers agree to match any
further contribution the employee makes up to an agreed limit.'
The provider
The money purchase pensions market is dominated by the life offices,
although several unit trust groups also offer arrangements. Your employer
should have taken expert independent advice and conducted an analysis of
different providers' financial strength, the management and commission
charges, administration facilities and investment record.
Employers advised by a salesperson or tied agent would have received details
of only one provider.
Investment options
It is important to check that the right funds are available. Experts
generally agree that a fairly high proportion of equity investment is
sensible during the early part of an employee's career (75 per cent or more
depending on age) but that it is essential to have a phased switching
facility to move funds into cash and bonds in the run-up to retirement. This
protects the fund against a stock market crash during these crucial years.
The charges
The scheme provider's charges may have a direct impact on the investment
return and flexibility of your pension scheme. Where a standard life office
package is used there are likely to be high commission costs to the
salesperson or adviser and a complex series of management and investment
charges. Many advisers are prepared to rebate part or all of the commission
in return for a fee. A good adviser will establish the most cost-effective
contribution method.
Flexibility
Flexibility has been put forward as one of the main attractions of money
purchase pensions because the employee has an easily identifiable and
apparently portable pot of money. The important point to check here is what
happens if you leave the scheme when you change jobs. Long term, regular
premium life office contracts are notorious for their early termination
penalties. Ideally your contract should have been established on a
non-commission basis. Alternatively, contributions should be paid on a
recurring single premium basis, as the upfront charges are modest and there
are no early termination charges.
There are no hard and fast rules on the merits of comps versus group
personal pensions. Personal pensions can be used to secure a very high level
of benefits for senior executives but they are also sold to employers who
want the cheapest and simplest structure available.
Barry Johnson, senior assistant director at Godwins, said: 'In practice a
comp scheme tends to be more generous and more cost-effective to the average
employee than a group personal pension.
'This is because under a comp the employer is likely to bear the
administration charges and the cost of life assurance and will probably pay
in a more generous contribution. Moreover, with a comp the employer is not
restricted to using a life office administration and investment package with
its associated higher and more complex charging structure.'

IN ITS last few months, the Business Expansion Scheme seems to have been
entirely devoted to the welfare of Oxbridge undergraduates.
One new issue this week seems to be a more logical use of such a generous
tax break from the Government. House the Homeless of London is supported by
the charity, the Peabody trust. It will be the last issue backed by the
Peabody (the BES will be abolished at the end of this year) and hopes to
raise Pounds 21m to buy properties in the boroughs of Haringey, Greenwich,
Hackney and Hammersmith &amp; Fulham.
The Peabody has agreed to buy back the properties in five years time at a
price which will bring investors 126p per share, which it claims is the
highest currently available return. The annual return to 40 per cent
taxpayers will be 14.9 per cent, and for basic rate taxpayers, 10.5 per
cent.
Although the deal is not cash-backed and lacks a bank guarantor, Peabody has
some Pounds 839m of assets. House the Homeless is sponsored by the
London-based Downing Corporate finance. The minimum investment is Pounds
1,000.
The Netherhall Residences scheme is sponsored by brokers James Capel and is
guaranteed by Midland Bank which, like Capel, is owned by the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank. The Pounds 5m scheme will buy properties for occupation by
students of the Netherhall Educational Association, a registered charity.
The principal objects of the NEA are described as 'the advancement of
education and the training of character in accordance with Christian
principles and ideals'.
NEA has agreed either to purchase the shares or repurchase the properties
after five years; the issue is designed to return 121p after five years with
Midland Bank guaranteeing to make up the shortfall. The return equates to
13.99 per cent per annum for top rate taxpayers, or 9.63 per cent per annum
for basic rate taxpayers. Minimum investment Pounds 1,000.
Perennial BES sponsors Johnson Fry has launched Pathfinder Recovery, a
company which will buy London properties, refurbish them and then let them.
Other Pathfinder companies, according to the prospectus, have achived a
gross rental yield of 12 per cent across a portfolio of 185 residential
properties. Unlike most of the other current BES issue, there is no
guaranteed price; on the other hand, there is no upper limit on the growth.
The company aims to achieve Pounds 1.40 per share for investors by the
target date.
Blenheim, which will manage the properties, will receive a fee of 1.95 per
cent of the funds raised per company, plus a fee of 1 per cent of the total
cost of each property bought, plus 4 per cent of the refurbishment costs.
Adminstrative costs will be 1.45 per cent per annum and the sponsor will
charge an annual fee of 0.5 per cent. If the share price rises above Pounds
1.40, the managers will receive A shares entitling them to 35 per cent of
the rise in the value of the company above that level.
The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 and a maximum of Pounds 10m is on
offer. Shares are available at 98p until October 5 and 100p thereafter.
Johnson Fry is also launching the Eleventh Johnson Fry Super Growth Scheme
to raise money for King's College London. The buy-back price is 125p; those
who invest before September 27 will pay 99p per share, equivalent to a
return for top rate taxpayers of 14.77 per cent per annum. The offer is not
cash backed but the property assets of King's are insured for Pounds 632m.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (3): The right balance
will reduce the risk - Structuring a portfolio / Philip Coggan invites three
financial advisers to consider the needs of three different types of
investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST SERIOUS investors realise that they should have a balanced portfolio.
Equities are too risky, cash and bonds are vulnerable to inflation, overseas
markets provide diversification but a currency risk.
But how should one put the disparate elements together into a portfolio? We
asked three financial advisers to suggest portfolios for three types of
wealthier investor. They were allowed to assume that the individuals had
already provided for basics such as pensions and life insurance.
The following were the advisers' thoughts in late August; market changes
between then and the publication date may have affected some of the
recommendations, so the portfolios should be treated as a starting point
only.
A portfolio of Pounds 500,000, for a UK couple who want income.
Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'We would divide our clients'
money into two distinct elements: an income or 'sinking' fund, and a
'growth' fund. The income fund, held in the building society and, perhaps, a
few income shares of split-level investment trusts, is responsible for
providing a quarterly, or even monthly, income for the investor.
'Drawing a mixture of interest and capital, the income fund is called upon
to deliver a regular fixed sum over a term of, say, five years. At the end
of that term, the income fund will have been totally eroded.
'However, over the same term, the growth fund should increase sufficiently
to replace the capital lost in the income portfolio. The growth fund makes
use of whatever allowances the client has available to maximise the tax-free
maturity of investments at the five-years stage.
'For husband and wife, I suggest that Pounds 90,000 would be in a postal
building society account, Pounds 60,000 in income shares of split-capital
trusts (Pounds 12,000 of this would be placed in a personal equity plan),
and Pounds 50,000 in debenture shares.
'This part of the portfolio would provide income, with the building society
account being steadily eroded.
'The income shares would have a high yield, and thus might lose some capital
over five years; the debenture shares would come from Dartmoor investment
trust, which have a 6 per cent gross yield, and where the income and capital
are index-linked.
'For the growth part of the portfolio, I suggest Pounds 114,000 in the
zero-coupon shares of split-capital investment trusts, then Pounds 90,000 in
a cash-backed Business Expansion Scheme (Pounds 40,000 each in the current
tax year and Pounds 5,000 each carried back to the 1992-93 tax year, if
invested before October 5).
'A further Pounds 40,000 can be invested in the 6th issue of index-linked
National Savings certificates. Each spouse can buy Pounds 10,000 for
themselves and hold a further Pounds 10,000 in trust for each other.
'For some growth, we might put Pounds 30,000 in the Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial
Protected Capital Plus, which is a three-month rolling account, tracking the
FT-SE 100 index. If it goes up, you get nearly all the rise. If it falls,
your quarterly loss is limited to 2 per cent.
'For extra growth, we would look at emerging markets. Investment trusts in
this area are at a bit of a premium right now, so we would put Pounds 20,000
in Olliff's City of London Emerging Markets unit trust. Finally, each
partner could put Pounds 3,000 into a single-company Pep.
'This combination will yield a net income of just over 5 per cent and
provide a decent level of capital growth at the end of five years.'
A portfolio of Pounds 500,000, for a UK individual who wants capital growth:
Michael Thompson, of stockbrokers Gerrard Vivian Gray, suggests a portfolio
with the following split:
Gilts, 20 per cent; zero-coupon preference shares, 20 per cent; and cash 2
per cent. The remainder would be invested in investment trusts specialising
in the UK (15 per cent), international (22 per cent), North America (5 per
cent), Europe (5 per cent), the Far East (5 per cent) and emerging markets
(6 per cent).
'In the gilts,' says Thompson, 'I would select Funding 3 1/2 per cent
1999/04 and the Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 2006. Although I believe
that we will be in a climate of low inflation and low interest rates for at
least the next two to three years, I believe it makes sense to maintain some
exposure to index-linked stocks as a hedge against the unexpected.'
Zeros offer investors steady capital growth but no income. Thompson opted
for four different zero stocks: TR Technology, Abtrust Preferred,
Contra-Cyclical and Fleming Income &amp; Capital.
For the investment trust selections, Thompson opts for, in the UK: TR City
of London, Murray Income, Derby Trust capital shares and River &amp; Mercantile
capital shares.
In the international category, he likes: Murray International, Alliance,
Bankers, F&amp;C and F&amp;C Smaller Companies. For Europe, he picks Ecu trust; for
North America, American trust and F&amp;C US Smaller Companies; for the Far
East, Fleming Japanese and EFM Dragon; and for emerging markets, Murray
Smaller Markets, Templeton Emerging Markets and the Latin American
Investment Trust.
A portfolio of Dollars 750,000 for an expatriate, or international investor,
whose base currency is dollars:
Graham Barnes, of Wilfred T Fry, in Worthing, says: 'An investor with dollar
liabilities will logically want to buy dollar assets, usually through
equities and US government bonds.
'However, problems face both sectors at the moment. First, it is difficult
to justify buying at the US stock market's current levels. Secondly, US
interest rates are low with little prospect of further immediate falls, and
there is little scope for capital profits from US bonds. The solution to
this problem would appear to be partly in timing and partly away from the
US.
'We would invest equally in bonds and equities. We favour European bonds,
where interest rates are most likely to be cut, probably further than in any
other economic area. That could well weaken European currency values against
the dollar, which would suggest hedging the currency exposure. Although
complicated, hedging can be arranged even for the individual.
'Stock markets can give growth in terms of income as well as capital. Thus,
two quite separate equity portfolios are indicated.
'First, 20 per cent of the total portfolio should be invested in a mixture
of Asian Pacific, emerging markets and European equities. Clearly, we are
looking for our capital gain away from the US in more volatile markets,
since we believe the potential reward justifies the currency risk (ie, local
currencies depreciating against the US dollar).
'Secondly, 30 per cent of the total portfolio should go into the US market,
but only when Wall Street declines from present levels. This part of the
portfolio would be invested for dividend growth and stability.
'It is important to state that the overall asset allocation set out here
would need regular review.'

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Permanent Interest Bearing Shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES OF Permanent Interest Bearing Shares have risen (and thus yields have
dropped) since we last printed the table on August 14. But Pibs fell back
this week as news of higher than expected inflation weakened the prices of
all fixed income instruments.
PIBS are fixed interest paying shares issued by building societies. Income
is usually paid twice a year. They offer higher yields than gilts because of
their higher risk: building societies are less secure than the government
and if a society collapsed, PIBS holders would be last in line to be paid
back.
As their name suggests, PIBS will never be repaid and there is no guarantee
that investors will get back what they paid for them. Broadly speaking, the
higher the PIBS yield, the more risky the society is perceived to be by the
market.
Simon Mozley of Hoare Govett, which supplied the table, says that the recent
issue from the Halifax 'met strong demand despite the current low yield
levels. This was a function of the near-par price at which it was issued
compared with the premium prices that exist for other issues.' The Halifax
issue is denominated in Pounds 50,000 chunks, which makes it unsuitable for
small investors.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Everything in the garden's . . .
locked up - The whys and hows of protecting your external assets against
theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE who would not dream of leaving their house unlocked quite happily
leave items worth hundreds of pounds lying around unsecured every day.
Somehow, when the items in question are in the garden, their potential for
being stolen is overlooked.
Unfortunately, thieves are not so shortsighted. Garden statuary, fish, rare
plants, furniture, lawnmowers and even gnomes are all targets.
You might assume that most of these items would be covered by your household
insurance, but in most cases household insurers limit cover for objects kept
outside to a few hundred pounds. For example, the Prudential has a limit of
Pounds 300.
The contents of your shed or any outbuildings will normally be treated like
any other house contents, if the shed is kept securely locked and in good
repair. Greenhouses are impossible to keep secure - windows need to be open
for ventilation, and glass can be broken - so insurers apply the same limits
to greenhouse contents as to objects kept outside. Accordingly, it is better
to keep tools and machinery in a locked shed. Brokers Artscope say they have
seen an increasing number of claims for stolen mowers and chainsaws.
Plants are vulnerable to theft as well as storms and vandalism, but
household policies will not usually cover living things. There is one
specialist, stand-alone garden policy on the market: Garden Guard, from UNAT
Direct, insures growing, fixed and portable objects against theft,
accidental damage, most weather and vandalism. There are some exclusions,
such as damage by frost and vermin. Four levels of cover are available: the
maximum is Pounds 6,750, costing Pounds 12.95 a month, and the minimum
Pounds 2,250, costing Pounds 4.95.
Plants can also be insured in conjunction with buildings and contents at
Hiscox, the specialist high-value household insurers. Rare plants can be
covered for a premium of 2.5 per cent of value, while for Pounds 50 you can
get a tree extension which provides up to Pounds 7,500 to make safe or
remove trees damaged by storms or vandalism.
Fish theft is a growing problem, not surprising when some koi carp can fetch
thousands. Adrian Brodrick, of specialist livestock insurance consultants
Brodrick &amp; Sons, has arranged insurance for koi carp collectors at Lloyd's.
A group of fish worth Pounds 3,000 was insured for an annual premium of
Pounds 150, against all perils, including death from disease, provided that
the fish were properly kept. Policies of this sort have high excesses, of
about 10 per cent of the sum insured. Minimum premiums are also high, but
owners can earn no-claims bonuses.
The people with most to lose from their gardens are collectors of sculpture.
Demand for good examples of 17th to 19th century urns and statues is high
throughout Europe and the US. Organised gangs with lorries and lifting gear
make selective raids, and the haul may be transported abroad within a matter
of hours. Even good reproductions can be at risk.
Obtaining insurance for art objects kept outside is difficult. The risk is
so high that insurers are unwilling to cover such items alone. The only way
is to add them to ordinary household contents insurance or, if you also
collect indoor artworks and antiques, to a fine art policy offered by
specialists such as Hiscox, Nordstern, Masterpiece and Wellington. Hiscox
would charge 1 per cent of value to cover outside objects as an add-on to a
household contents policy.
If you can find an insurer willing to take on the risk, you will often be
asked to improve security. A report on the theft of garden statues and
ornaments, published this week by the UK branch of the International Council
on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and Haddonstone, manufacturer of
reproduction garden statuary, found that few owners had adequate security.
'Most owners fail to take even elementary precautions, although a range of
sophisticated methods is available,' says Edward Fawcett, chairman of ICOMOS
UK. 'The aim must be to deter thieves by early warning and giving them
insufficient time to complete the theft.'
He recommends measures such as securing the statue with a stainless steel
dowel attached to a concrete block below ground level. Gates should be
locked to prevent lorries or cranes getting close. Alarms and
movement-sensitive lights can also be used.
Rob Page, of Hiscox, recommends keeping statues surrounded by cultivated
ground rather than lawns. This makes them more difficult to remove, as
lifting equipment needs a stable base, and also means thieves will leave
marks which could help identify them.
However, thieves can break through almost any security system given time and
determination. If an object is stolen, chances of recovery are small, but
can be maximised by keeping good photographs of all the items, and marking
them.
If security measures are not possible, or the statue is very valuable, one
alternative is to have a replica made, or buy a similar but cheaper work,
and keep the real thing somewhere more secure.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: China fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEMINGS is launching what will be only the second specialist China
investment trust in the UK. The Fleming Chinese Investment Trust aims to
take advantage of high growth rates and the rapid development of a free
market in China to produce long-term capital growth for UK investors. The
fund will aim to raise between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m from institutions
and investors.
The number of companies with shares listed on mainland Chinese markets is
very small - a total of 30. Therefore initially a large proportion of the
fund will be invested in smaller Hong Kong companies, with a market
capitalisation of less than USDollars 300m, which derive a substantial part
of their revenue from China. The fund will also buy 'H' shares, issued on
the Hong Kong exchange by mainland Chinese companies.
However, a significant amount will be invested from the start in the 'B'
shares open to foreign buyers on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges
and, as opportunities arise with new issues, the proportion of the fund
invested directly in China will be increased. Small proportions will also be
invested in Taiwanese and Korean companies with strong China connections.
The investment portfolio will be managed by Jardine Fleming, which is based
in Hong Kong but has offices in Shanghai, Taipei, and Seoul. Jardine Fleming
already runs two China funds, listed in New York and Hong Kong.
The offer price for the new trust is 100p a share. There will be one warrant
issued with every five shares, which can be exercised at 100p on dates
between 1998 and 2004. The fund's life is unlimited, but there will be a
continuation vote after ten years.
Expenses for the issue will be capped at 3.5 per cent, but should be closer
to 2.8 per cent if the full Pounds 50m is raised. Annual management fees and
administration costs will add up to about 1.45 per cent. The shares will not
pay a dividend. The public offer opens on September 22, and closes at 10am
on Friday October 8.
The minimum investment is Pounds 1,500, the maximum that can be invested in
this kind of fund via a Pep. However, investors who make use of this route
will have to use a self-select Pep. It will also be possible to invest
through a monthly savings scheme once dealing in the trust's shares has
started on October 19. Minimum investment is Pounds 40 a month.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Three steps to success - Unit Trusts
/ Gartmore British Growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW person in charge always likes to make a fresh start. When Duncan
Trinder took over the running of the Gartmore British Growth fund in June
1989, he says he stood back and asked himself what holders would want a unit
trust to provide.
He decided there were three main factors: the ability consistently to
outperform the FT-A All-Share; to provide liquidity by investing in
marketable stocks; and for the manager to perform serious, in-depth research
on individual shares.
'The only way of achieving all three objectives,' says Trinder, 'was to
concentrate on a restrictive list of around 200 large companies. Choosing
the right large companies can produce outperformance, large company stocks
provide liquidity and a restrictive list allows you to conduct in-depth
research.'
Trinder says he cut the number of holdings in the fund down from 90 to 25
stocks. 'Management of this trust is very much a stock-picking exercise. In
no way is this an index fund.' This certainly makes sense from Gartmore's
point of view; it already has a low-cost trust (no initial charge, annual
charge 0.5 per cent) which tracks the All-Share.
There is no magic formula to successful investment, says Trinder. But he
adds: 'Ever since I've been involved in the stock market, it has been
sector-driven. Every industry has a cycle, which is dependent on too much or
too little capacity. When capacity is short, pricing is strong and
profitability is strong.'
Accordingly, he tries to find stocks that can benefit from the cycle and
that have a below-average market rating and an above-average dividend yield.
He says he is more of a value than a growth investor. 'I don't like paying
high price-earnings ratios and I don't get emotionally involved with stocks.
If the p/e is high and you feel the position could deteriorate, you should
sell the stock.'
As an example of his style, he cites the reasons for buying shares in GEC,
his largest holding which forms 8 per cent of the fund. When he first bought
stock, GEC shares were on a price-earnings ratio of only 75 per cent of
market average and on a high yield. The company had conservative accounting
policies, scope for margin improvement and alliances with major companies
such as Siemens. The shares have risen from 185p at the time of his first
purchase to around 340p today.
Apart from GEC, the rest of Trinder's top 10 stocks are: Prudential, Hanson,
George Wimpey, BICC, BPB, Great Universal Stores, Cable &amp; Wireless, Lonrho
and Reed International.
The list shows a greater concentration on capital goods stocks. 'Capital
goods companies will perform a lot better in the 1990s,' he says. 'Consumers
worldwide will be frightened of spending the sort of money they spent in the
1980s. They will not be prepared to pay high prices and will look for
value.'
While unemployment remains high, Trinder feels governments will be forced to
pursue Keynesian policies and spend money on infrastructure. 'Even where
governments are in budget deficit, they will not cut back on capital
projects,' he argues. 'Furthermore, low growth, low inflation and low
interest rates will be conducive to capital formation.' As a result, Trinder
believes the margins of consumer companies will fall, while those of capital
goods companies will rise.
So far Trinder's methods have been successful. The British Growth trust is
fourth (out of 116 funds) in the UK Equity Growth sector, with a return of
111.86 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested. Source: Micropal).
Over three years, the performance is also impressive, with growth of 68 per
cent placing the fund 14th out of 136 funds.
Only over the past year has the relative performance dropped, with British
Growth placed 75th out of 144 funds (albeit still recording a healthy 36.8
per cent return). This, argues Trinder, is because of the outperformance of
smaller companies since the start of 1993. The FT Small-Cap index rose 31.1
per cent between January 1 and September 10 and the FT-SE 100 Index was up
6.7 per cent.
Trinder is unrepentant. 'If I went into smaller companies, I'd have to buy
lots of them as the fund grew. The fund would lose its discipline.' He
believes his focused strategy will enable him to beat the All-Share over the
long run.
Charges. The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual charge is 1.5
per cent. For those buying the trust in Pep form, however, the initial
charge is just 2 per cent; there are then exit charges of 3 per cent in year
one, 2 per cent in year two and 1 per cent in year three. The bid-offer
spread inside the Pep is 3.5 per cent; outside the Pep it is 6.49 per cent.
The yield is 1.3 per cent - not a fund for income-seekers. Minimum
investment is Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 50 for Peps.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Warrants: what's the risk? - The
Speculator / How to assess an investment for the brave-hearted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POTENTIAL advantages and disadvantages of an investment in warrants were
highlighted in my article last week. But how do you assess the relative
attractiveness of individual warrants?
The most important consideration must be the underlying performance of the
company's ordinary shares. If a company is going through a poor period and
the ordinary shares have fallen in price, then their respective warrants
will not perform well, irrespective of their own technical merit.
Individuals should use the usual methods of analysis when evaluating the
ordinary shares, such as future company profitability, assets and the record
of management.
In evaluating the warrants themselves, prospective investors will need to
analyse factors including the time to expiry, gearing, price volatility and
the capital fulcrum point (CFP).
The price premium
Owing to the potential benefits that warrants confer, they will normally
(though not necessarily) command a higher price than the warrant is
intrinsically worth at its conversion date. This 'conversion premium' is the
price one pays for buying the warrants rather than the shares. The lower the
premium, the 'cheaper' the warrants.
The premium is calculated by adding the warrant price to the exercise price,
then deducting the share price, and finallydividing the result by the share
price. Investors will find that premiums vary dramatically and are one of
the most important technical factors used when evaluating the worth of a
warrant.
Time to expiry
The longer the remaining life of a warrant, the greater the opportunity for
its intrinsic value to increase as the underlying share price appreciates.
Accordingly, the premium also takes into account and incorporates what is
known as 'time value'. This reflects the likely appreciation in price during
the remainder of the warrant's life. The time value may be considerable if a
warrant has several years to run, but will diminish as the time to expiry
approaches.
Capital Fulcrum Point (CFP)
The Capital Fulcrum Point is an indicator of the annual percentage growth of
the share price required for an individual to be equally well off, in
capital appreciation terms, whether he buys the warrants or the shares. A
growth rate above the CFP will make the warrants a better buy; a growth rate
below the CFP will be better for the shares.
If, when calculated, the CFP equals 8 per cent and the share price were
actually to rise by 10 per cent per annum to the final conversion date, then
investors would have been better off buying the warrants. In general, the
lower the CFP, the more attractive the warrants.
An example of the above principles may help. XYZ plc's share price is
currently Pounds 1.20, with an exercise price of Pounds 1.10. The warrants,
priced at 40p, currently command a premium of 25 per cent (Pounds
1.10+40-Pounds 1.20 = 30p; dividing by Pounds 1.20 gives 25 per cent). The
warrants have eight years' life remaining.
In this case, the CFP is 4.06 per cent. Theoretically, therefore, if the
shares rise at this level over the next eight years, investors would be
equally well off with either the warrants or the ordinary shares. (You would
actually be better off with the shares as this calculation does not take
account of dividends paid, only capital appreciation).
The formula for calculating the CFP is extremely complicated and an expert
should be consulted.
Volatility
The more volatile a company's share price, the more likely it is that the
warrants will show a capacity to provide higher levels of capital gains (or
losses).
As you can see, evaluating warrants is a technical process involving a
number of variables. Without the benefit of professional advice, this
analysis may be beyond many ordinary investors. However, help is always at
hand.
The 'Warrants Alert' newsletter includes a constantly updated table of
expensive or cheap warrants based purely on technical analysis. It is
published by Andrew McHattie (0275-855 558). McHattie has also produced an
introductory guide to warrants costing Pounds 6 and, for more sophisticated
investors, has written a book entitled The Investor's Guide to Warrants,
costing Pounds 42.55. The Association of Investment Trust Companies (071-586
5347) also publishes a free factsheet guide for individuals thinking of
making an investment.
I cannot stress enough the need for accurate and detailed analysis prior to
making an investment into warrants. It is a volatile market in which the
opportunities for spectacular capital gains are counter-balanced by the
possibility of an investment falling to zero. Investment into warrants
should in my opinion, never form more than 10 per cent of an overall
balanced portfolio. Used wisely, however, they will make a valuable
contribution to the portfolio's overall capital growth prospects.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: LAS sold to building society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOLLOWING the sale this week of Life Association of Scotland to Britannia
Building Society, the average investor must be wondering whether there will
soon be any independent life insurance companies left in Britain.
The answer, according to industry analysts, is that yes, there will be, but
there will be far fewer of them and those that remain will be the industry
giants or those which specialise in niche products.
With the acquisition, Britannia, which through its branches and estate
agencies has roughly 250 outlets, says that it now has the largest retail
financial services operation of any UK building society.
By all accounts, the acquisition of LAS came not a moment too soon for the
Edinburgh-based life insurer, owned for the past 25 years by Internationale
Nederlanden. According to data from Standard and Poor's, which now rates the
financial strength of life insurance companies, LAS has been facing
difficulties.
Its so-called free-asset ratio, broadly defined as the excess of assets over
liabilities, had fallen to just over 7 per cent at the end of 1991. The
minimum excess set by insurance industry regulators is 4 per cent and S &amp; P,
in a recent report, noted that the very high costs of acquiring new business
were placing further strains on capital.
Thus, for policyholders, news of a new parent with capital to inject should
be good news. Britannia has declined to say exactly how much it is paying
for LAS, but it does intend to inject some Pounds 25m in fresh capital into
the new subsidiary over the next two years.
How that money will be deployed is not yet clear. If it is used to build up
LAS's unit linked businesses, the effects are likely to most help new
policyholders who could reap the benefits of lower overheads.
Indeed, Britannia cited LAS's unit linked product line as one of the most
attractive aspects of acquiring the insurer in the first place. Its existing
operations feature so-called with profits policies which smooth investment
returns to investors over time.
ING had last injected capital into the unit several years earlier in a
largely unsuccessful effort to boost sales by developing a direct sales
force. John Heaps, chief executive of Britannia, said much of that
'cold-calling' sales force will be relocated to branch offices, cutting the
cost of each additional sale.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: New medical cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNHILL Insurance is moving into the private medical insurance market for
the first time, in a link-up with Deutsche Krankenversicherung, the largest
health insurer in Europe. It is launching a range of three policies under
the name Cornhill HealthCare Options.
Option A is a comprehensive plan, covering in-patient and out-patient
treatment at a wide range of hospitals. It also covers physiotherapy,
chiropractic and osteopathy. Treatment for chronic and incurable illnesses
is covered after a person has been continuously insured for five years.
Option B provides cover of up to Pounds 12,500 a year in mid-range hospital
accommodation, which can be increased if complications arise.
Option C limits cover to Pounds 10,000 a year in lower-priced accommodation,
but the limit can be raised if there are complications. Unlike most low-cost
plans, immediate private treatment is not dependent on NHS waiting lists
being longer than six weeks.
All the plans include Pounds 50 a night cash benefit if the customer is
treated as an NHS patient, and emergency cover up to certain limits in EC
countries. Option A would cost Pounds 84.90 a month for a healthy
45-year-old, option B Pounds 57.83, and option C Pounds 39.87. The maximum
age at entry is 59.
Private Patients Plan has revamped its range of medical insurance policies,
introducing two low-cost schemes. The Premier and Classic plans are
equivalent to existing comprehensive schemes, while Secure is a low-cost
option with a six-week rule. The new options are Select and Value. Both
operate a six-week rule.
Select covers out-patient treatment, psychiatric treatment, home nursing,
private ambulances, medical travel insurance, and a parent accompanying a
child aged under nine into hospital. There is no overall limit on claims.
Value limits cover to Pounds 10,000, Pounds 20,000 where complications
arise.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Spring Ram await Wednesday's announcement of its interim
results with a sense of foreboding. New chairman Roger Regan is likely to
have ordered a harsh scrutiny of the troubled kitchens and bathrooms group's
fortunes after being brought in by institutions following three profits
warnings and a share price collapse. Analysts do not know what figures to
expect, but will really be seeking reassurance that there are no black holes
in the accounts of the fallen stock market favourite.
Tesco, the UK's second biggest grocery retailer, is expected on Tuesday to
announce a 6 per cent increase in interim profits from Pounds 253m to about
Pounds 268m. The figures are expected to do little to improve market
sentiment on Tesco, especially as its announcement could well be followed by
further pessimistic observations from Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda
about saturation in the UK food market, at that group's annual meeting on
Wednesday.
William Morrison Supermarkets, the supermarket chain based in the north and
Scotland, reports on Thursday and is expected to lift pre-tax profits from
Pounds 36.2m last time to between Pounds 43m and Pounds 45m this. The
dividend is likely to be lifted from 0.16p to between 0.19p and 0.2p.
MAI, the financial services group which reports annual profits on Monday, is
expected to unveil a 9 per cent increase to about Pounds 78m at the pre-tax
level. Shareholders are expected to be rewarded with a 10 per cent rise in
the dividend to 6.6p.
Hays, the business services group, is expected on Tuesday to report
full-year profits of about Pounds 66m. Analysts had been going for up to
Pounds 75m until the interim results in March, which were at the bottom end
of expectations.
Analysts are undecided about Thursday's half-year pre-tax results for
Guinness, the brewing company, and have given forecasts of between Pounds
305m and Pounds 338m, against Pounds 353m, for the six months to June 30. A
dividend of about 3.7p (3.35p) is expected. The market will be looking for
progress in the company's Spanish beer operations and will be checking the
size of any currency gain.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (2): First, understand the
three varieties - Choosing a stockbroker / The decision is more of an art
than a science, says Philip Coggan. It's difficult, but a useful guide may
by provided by the performance of any unit or investment trusts that your
prospective broker runs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR SOME people with 'old money', the family stockbroker is like the doctor
and solicitor, a faithful adviser whose wisdom is passed from generation to
generation.
But those who have acquired their wealth more recently face the problem of
finding a broker for the first time. There is perhaps a natural suspicion
that the wrong choice may result in the loss of a hard-earned fortune - that
the quickest way of becoming a millionaire is to give a stockbroker Pounds
2m to invest.
The first step in choosing a broker is to understand that there are three
types of stockbroker:
Execution-only
Execution-only brokers will buy and sell shares on your behalf, without
giving any advice.
Their chief attraction is that their commissions are lower than those
charged by other brokers. Rivals sometimes claim that execution-only brokers
fail to get the best price in the market for their customers, and that this
negates the commission saving - but this argument is hotly disputed by the
execution-only sector.
Advisory
Advisory brokers, as their name suggests, will give clients advice on which
shares to buy, and at what price. However, the overall responsibility for
decisions remains with the client. The brokers receive their payment in the
form of commission every time the client deals.
Discretionary
Discretionary brokers take full charge of the client's portfolio. They may
charge a fee for this - based on a percentage of the amount of money managed
 -or they may earn their return in the form of commissions.
In recent years, there has been a tendency for advisory brokers to get
squeezed out by the other two types. Charging a fee to manage a portfolio
creates a stable source of income for the discretionary broker; cut-price
dealing services attract a mass market (and high volumes) for the
execution-only broker.
The advisory broker must rely on clients who may only decide to deal once or
twice a year. But the differences between the three categories are becoming
increasingly blurred.
Sharelink, for example, is an execution-only broker but it produces low-cost
information packs on companies, designed to help investors to pick shares.
Choosing a broker is rather more an art than a science. If one opts for an
execution-only service, it is slightly easier, since it is mainly a question
of opting for the lowest commission rate. (Nevertheless, wealthy investors
should take care. Some execution-only brokers slant their rates towards the
smaller investor).
Judging an advisory broker is also difficult, because it is virtually
impossible to quantify the value of advice. And even discretionary brokers
are hard to judge, because they will rarely be able to produce figures for
the 'average' client, on the grounds that each client has different needs
and a different level of tolerance for risk.
One useful guide can be provided by any unit and investment trusts run by
the broker. They have a published record, which can be checked in
publications such as the FT's sister magazine, Money Management. If the unit
and investment trusts have not performed well in their sectors, that ought
to say something about the firm's investment management skills.
But qualitative, rather than quantitative, measures may be important. You
may well wish to be able to speak regularly to a named broker; you may want
the firm to handle all your dividend payments and associated tax credits,
and to deal with your capital gains tax planning. You should certainly
expect regular, and easy-to-understand, portfolio valuations.
Where might you expect investments to be made? Mercury Asset Management
describes a typical portfolio, for a UK client, as: UK shares, 60 per cent;
cash/bonds, 17 per cent; European shares, 8 per cent; US shares, 7 per cent;
Far Eastern shares, 4 per cent; and Japanese shares, 4 per cent.
Some brokers offer money market accounts, which pay competitive rates of
interest on cash held by clients as they move between equity investments.
And services can be a lot more sophisticated than that.
Prudential Bache Securities, for example, has a Luxembourg-based private
bank, which will lend customers money against the value of their stock
portfolios.
A good broker ought to have no problems in buying and selling overseas
shares, or indeed in offering services in other major currencies such as the
US dollar.
Nor do you need to rely on the investment skills of one broker alone.
Pru-Bache also offers Managed Assets Consulting Services which gives
investors the choice of a range of top money managers, whose services might
not be otherwise available for individuals.
A similar concept is provided by the Optima fund, a Bermuda-registered fund
run by Dixon Boardman, formerly of Kidder Peabody, which selects the 12 best
managers of US mutual funds. The minimum investment is Dollars 500,000.
For some, all these additional services may be irrelevant; all they want is
a broker that they can rely on to be careful with their money. The
recommendation of a friend or colleague may well be the best guide.
But for those who want to find their own broker, a list can be obtained from
the Association of Private Client Managers and Stockbrokers, 5th floor, 20
Dysart Street, London EC2A 2BX.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Following in George Soros' footsteps
 -One year on from Black Wednesday, Philip Coggan finds out what scope there
is for the private investor in currency funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago, sterling dropped out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and its
value against other European currencies dropped sharply. The international
investor George Soros supposedly made a billion dollars out of the pound's
fall.
So how easy is it for private investors to follow the Soros route? Nipping
down to the bank to exchange your pounds for Japanese yen is obviously too
expensive a way of playing the foreign exchange markets.
Currency funds are designed to give small investors the chance to diversify
their assets. They need not be used purely for speculation. If you are
planning to retire, or emigrate, to another country, a fund gives you the
opportunity to build up savings in the currency of your new home. Given that
the pound has shown a long-term tendency to decline (sterling was worth
Dollars 4.03 in 1949), it may be sensible for a UK investor to hold part of
his or her assets in a foreign currency.
The drawback of currency funds is that they are invested purely in cash, or
deposit, instruments. Over the long run, therefore, they tend to produce
poor returns compared with the alternatives of bonds and equities. For
example, the average dollar-denominated fund produced a return of 85.8 per
cent over the 10 years to September 1 (offer-to-offer: source Hardwick
Stafford Wright); the worst performing UK equity growth unit trust returned
98.9 per cent over the same period, whilst the average was 283.8 per cent.
However, if you opt for a bond or equity-based overseas fund, you are no
longer making a pure currency play. You might have picked the right currency
(one which will appreciate against the pound) but the wrong equity or bond
market, so that the losses on the latter wipe out your foreign exchange
gains.
One should also try not to get carried away by the short-term movements on
the foreign exchange markets. Back in August 1992, the Weekend FT ran a
piece highlighting the fact that the pound was worth around two dollars, a
situation which appeared to be unsustainable, and suggesting ways that
investors could profit from a dollar rebound.
Sure enough, just over one year later, the pound is worth Dollars 1.53. The
average dollar-denominated currency fund has given investors a return of 37
per cent, in sterling terms, over the year to September 1. But an investor
would have done better to buy a UK equity growth unit trust, which returned
an average 40.96 per cent over the period. Soros made his billion by
allowing his funds to borrow to invest in the areas they favour. But that
would be most unwise for a private investor.
Having established all the caveats, suppose you are convinced that you have
the power to predict the movements of the foreign exchange markets and you
want to back your judgment. How do you pick your currency and how do you
pick your fund?
The factors which govern exchange rate movements are highly complex, but
there are three obvious long-term influences:
Inflation. The higher a country's inflation rate, the more its currency will
tend to depreciate. Economists talk of 'purchasing power parity'; the theory
that tradable goods, such as Mars bars, should cost the same, after exchange
rate conversion, round the world. If goods are very expensive in one
country, that is a sign its currency may be overvalued.
This process can be self-perpetuating; if currencies devalue, the price of
imported goods will rise, increasing inflation and putting pressure on the
currency to devalue once more.
Latin America provides an obvious example of the effect of inflation on
currency values; in some countries, such as Brazil, hyperinflation and a
rapidly deteriorating currency go hand in hand. But major currencies may
stay out of line with their purchasing power parity values for quite a long
time. Balance of payments. If a country is running a trade deficit then
obviously it is paying out more for imports than it is receiving for its
exports. Foreign traders will start to accumulate its currency, with which
they will buy bonds or other investments. Since buyers and sellers of a
currency are matched, the outflow on the current account of the balance of
payments is ofset by an equal inflow of capital. For this reason, a big
trade deficit may be sustained for several years; but if foreign investors
lose confidence in the government's ability to control inflation or its
trade and budget deficits, they will withdraw their money and the currency
may depreciate extremely steeply.
Alternatively, countries with balance of payments deficits may devalue their
currencies, in order to make their exports cheaper and more attractive to
foreign buyers. Japan, which has a large balance of payments surplus, is
willing to see the yen rise (which makes its exports more expensive for
foreigners). The reasoning, no doubt, is that it is better to eliminate the
deficit through a strong yen than through protectionist measures on the part
of the West.
Interest rates. If a country increases its interest rates, that increases
the attraction of holding its currency. Therefore, high interest rates can
be used to support a currency, as Britain used them during its membership of
the Exchange Rate Mechanism between 1990 and 1992.
However, high interest rates can often indicate a weak currency, since
investors need the high rate to compensate them for the expected
depreciation. And investors will be happy to invest in a currency with low
interest rates, if they expect the exchange rate to appreciate.
It was foolish to think, in 1990, that there was an easy way to a cheap
mortgage - borrowing in a foreign currency with lower interest rates than in
the UK. The pound's decline since then will have increased the sterling
value of the debt. Similarly, it would be wrong to assume that investing in
a country with higher interest rates is a surefire way to achieve enhanced
investment returns.
It is important to remember, however, that all these factors which may be
important to exchange rate movements in the long run may not matter in the
short run. Foreign exchange traders tend to worry about the next hour rather
than the next year; sentiment and chart patterns are just as likely to
govern their actions as macro-economic factors.
Once you have chosen your currency, based perhaps on its inflation, balance
of payments position and so on, how do you make the next step of choosing
the right fund?
The first thing to realise is that currency funds are usually offshore-based
and so, for those who remember Barlow Clowes, security must be an important
consideration. The safest decision is to opt for those funds which come
under the 'SIB recognised' heading in the Managed Funds pages of the FT.
This means the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's chief financial
services regulator, has accepted that regulation in the offshore centre is
equivalent to that in the UK, and that the funds are run in a proper manner.
After opting for a SIB-recognised fund, you must then make two further
choices. The first is between a roll-up and a distribution fund. With the
former, any gains made or income received are accumulated within the unit
price; UK investors only pay tax when they withdraw money. This means that
tax can be deferred, perhaps until the investor is in a lower tax bracket or
has moved offshore.
Distribution funds must pay out at least 85 per cent of their revenue as
income, which is taxed as income. Any other gain (ie not income) is taxed
under the capital gains tax rules. Distribution funds pay income gross which
may be handy for non-taxpayers.
Having chosen between distribution and accumulation (or roll-up funds), you
must then choose between a managed fund and a single currency fund. Under
the former, you select a fund manager who makes investment decisions on the
basis of his or her expectation of currency movements. By investing in a
broad spread of currencies, the fund is more stable than a single currency
fund; however, the charges tend to be higher and investors cannot back their
individual currency 'hunches'.
The range of single currency funds is now very wide. Fidelity's
Bermuda-based funds, for example, offer Australian dollars, Austrian
schillings, Canadian dollars, Deutschmarks, Dutch guilders, Ecus, French
francs, Hong Kong dollars, Irish punts, Italian lire, New Zealand dollars,
Spanish pesetas, sterling, Swiss francs, and US dollars. Rothschild Asset
Management's Guernsey funds also offer a very diverse selection, including
Belgian francs and Danish krone.
The tables show the top performing SIB-recognised funds over the past year
in three categories: managed, US dollars and Japanese yen. Those seeking
further details can find addresses and phone numbers on the Managed Funds
pages in section one of today's FT.

FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (1): Life without
double-digit returns - Introduction / As investors face a period of
adjustment, they should realise that tax-saving is not everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL services industry is eager to befriend the wealthy investor.
Whether your lump sum comes from a redundancy pay-off, an early retirement
package, the sale of a business, or the death of a relative, you will be
sure to find plenty of people willing to advise you how to invest it.
The problem lies in telling the difference between those who will make you
wealthier still and those who will make themselves wealthy at your expense.
Those who seek to help will display themselves in many guises:
private-client stockbrokers, private bankers, independent financial
advisers, financial planners, solicitors and accountants. Often the services
will be very similar: private client stockbrokers offer money market
accounts for your spare cash; private bankers emphasise their skills in
money management.
Choosing an adviser may, in the end, come down to whether you feel you can
trust the individual concerned, whatever the category of organisation he or
she works for. A good rule of thumb is to distinguish between technical and
investment expertise. There are plenty of people who can give sound advice
about tax and pension planning. But it would be a mistake to assume that
your accountant knows where the stock market will be in six months time, or
whether ICI will outperform Hanson. If he knew all the investment answers,
he would have quit accountancy to live in Barbados long ago.
Many investors will feel the need for a good adviser at the moment. For
those who live off the income from their savings, the past three years have
been challenging. Interest rates have tumbled around the world, reducing the
attraction of the easy option of keeping money on deposit.
Those who managed to switch out of cash at the right time - UK long gilt
yields were still 12 per cent in early 1990 - have reaped the benefits. But
many people realised what was happening late in the day and have only
started to contemplate the switch in recent months.
For them, choices are difficult. Lower interest rates have led to a rally in
the prices of financial instruments. Bond yields have tumbled - 30-year US
Treasuries were offering a touch over 6 per cent in August, long gilt yields
around 7.5 per cent. Meanwhile, equity yields dropped below 3 per cent in
the US, and 4 per cent in the UK. Even though economic recovery appears to
be under way in both countries, those yield valuations look quite expensive
by historical standards.
So not only do equities and bonds offer, by recent standards, a modest
income; there is always the prospect that if the interest-rate cycle turns,
there may be a sharp fall in share and bond prices.
Nevertheless, with inflation subdued in most leading economies, the world
could be due for a long period of low interest rates. The bulls argue that
the old measures of equity valuations, based on periods when inflation was
much higher, are no longer relevant.
Even so, investors face a severe psychological adjustment: they can no
longer expect the double-digit percentage returns they received in the past.
Some argue that a major investment theme of the moment is the gradual
transfer of economic power from the high-wage west to the low-wage
developing world, and in particular the Far East. The correct investment
approach, therefore, is to buy bonds in the developed world and equities in
the so-called emerging markets. Certainly, a week rarely passes at the
moment without a new emerging markets fund being launched on an enthusiastic
investment community.
For those seeking ideas for their own investment strategies, this survey
includes articles on portfolio planning - with tips from three financial
advisers - and on unit and investment trusts, which the wealthy can easily
overlook.
Tax is also a very important issue for the wealthy investor, especially as
the 1980s tax-cutting tide appears to be receding, with governments in the
US, UK and Germany all producing tax-raising packages.
For the British investor, there are a number of tax breaks available, from
the soon-to-be-abolished Business Expansion Scheme (BES) to the flourishing
personal equity plan (Pep). The survey has articles on the major shelters,
as well as pieces on coping with capital gains tax and inheritance tax, and
on setting up a family trust.
As a wise investor once said, 'there are worse things in life than paying
taxes', and it is a mistake to be carried away by the tax-free label. It is
far better to earn 10 per cent and pay tax on the profits than to lose 5 per
cent in some badly timed tax-free investment.
Nevertheless, sometimes the tax shelters seem too good to be true; under the
BES, for example, cash-backed property deals can offer to double the
top-rate taxpayer's money over five years at minimal risk. And Peps have
probably been of most benefit to wealthy investors (the most likely to pay
CGT), who have simply transferred a chunk of their portfolios into tax-free
form.
For the international investor, it is the offshore tax havens that supply
the siren voice. It is a mistake to think these havens are really tax-free:
a UK investor is obliged to pay tax on his or her worldwide income. But a
classic use for an offshore fund is to postpone tax until the individual is
in a lower, or simply more advantageous, tax bracket.
The activities of Bernie Cornfeld, and more recently Barlow Clowes, have
indicated the dangers of investing beyond the regulators' net. Some offshore
centres, concerned about their reputations, have tightened up their
regulations and established compensation schemes; in the Managed Funds pages
of the FT, investors should look for the label 'SIB-recognised', which
indicates regulation of a standard similar to that applying in the UK.
Such is the potential of the 'jet-set' market that many highly respectable
firms have set up offshore funds. The giant US group Fidelity, for example,
has a range of money market funds in Bermuda and a range of equity and bond
funds in Luxembourg.
With modern executives frequently moving between countries, the offshore
market is likely to grow substantially; so this survey contains an article
on financial planning for expatriates and a profile of the Channel Islands.
Finally, the serious investor should not forget the importance of other
types of cover; which is why the survey has pieces on insurance, both for
your life and for your possessions, and, given the ever-rising cost of
healthcare, on the latest medical insurance plans. Failure to insure oneself
properly against these costs may be more financially ruinous than making the
wrong stock-picking decision.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Markets: Breath of fresh air as summer's lease ends - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of summer is always a refreshing time in New York. As the heat and
humidity drops, so the energy level picks up noticeably. City dwellers
return from their summer homes, the tourist numbers dwindle, schools reopen,
and the first flecks of autumnal browns appear in Central Park.
The financial markets also seem to come to life as the summer slumbers
recede, and there was enough action on Wall Street this week to keep
investors, traders and analysts buzzing for at least another month.
There was some disturbing news on inflation, which prompted a week-long, and
potentially rally-busting, slide in bond prices. There was talk from senior
central bankers about 'speculative bubbles' in financial markets, which,
combined with an unexpected jump in money supply figures, sparked renewed
speculation about the outlook for monetary policy and interest rates. There
was also a huge merger in the entertainment industry that could yet turn
into the first billion-dollar takeover fight of the 1990s.
And to top it all off, there was the latest quarterly 'triple-witching', the
simultaneous expiration of stock and stock index futures and options
contracts that can temporarily turn the day's trading into a frenzied
roller-coaster ride.
Yesterday's witching hour did not disappoint - sell orders related to the
expirations backed up quickly as the market's opening approached, creating
huge order imbalances in a small army of stocks. Soon after the starting
bell rang, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 17 points, and by the
end of the first 30 minutes of trading a 159m shares had changed hands - the
busiest half-hour in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.
Five days earlier, the week had kicked off with a big surprise from the
monthly inflation data. Just two days after the core measure of August
producer prices had recorded its biggest decline in history, the consumer
prices index was released showing a much stronger-than-expected August
increase of 0.3 per cent. The news rocked the bond market back on its heels,
sending the yield on the long bond back above 6 per cent.
Although plenty of analysts warned not to read too much into one month's
figures, and said that any selling of bonds was a natural reaction after a
summer-long rally that surprised almost everyone in its length and depth,
the CPI data injected a note of uncertainty into the fixed-income markets
that lasted the entire week. The losses in bonds quickly fed through into
equities, where the Dow closed 18 points lower on Tuesday.
If traders and investors were expressing new concern about inflation, senior
officials at the Federal Reserve were voicing their own fears about the
impact of low interest rates on domestic financial markets.
David Mullins, vice chairman of the Fed, and Lawrence Lindsey, a governor at
the Fed, said in newspaper interviews that the central bank had to be wary
of pushing interest rates any lower for fear of encouraging a speculative
bubble in stock and bond prices of the kind that emerged in Japan in the
late 1980s. They warned that the bubble could eventually burst with drastic
consequences, just as the bubble burst in Japan, sending its economy into a
long slump.
These warnings, more candid than normal Fed utterances, were remarkable
enough in their own right, but took on an added relevance when Thursday's
money supply figures were released showing a sharp rebound in the growth of
M2 - the broadest measure of money supply. Although the Fed recently played
down the importance of M2 because of the unreliability of the data, the jump
in M2 during the first week of September was regarded by many analysts as
proof that interest rates need go no lower.
While the M2 numbers exacerbated the decline in bond prices, equities
managed to hold their ground. Stock market sentiment was relatively robust,
in part because of the week's big corporate story - the Dollars 8.2bn
acquisition of Paramount Communications by Viacom International, the
fast-expanding cable television group.
Although the deal was agreed between the two companies on Sunday, by midweek
talk of a rival suitor for Paramount was sweeping the market. QVC, the
home-shopping network run by former Hollywood and television mogul Barry
Diller, was seen as the most likely bidder to emerge as a rival to Viacom.
By Friday there was no hard evidence that a counter offer was imminent, but
the speculation was enough to send traders and investment bankers home happy
at the thought of the money that might be made from the market's first
competitive multi-billion-dollar bid in more than three years.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Markets: Recognising the spirit of adventure - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HE WHO ventures has definitely been winning over the last year. If any
sector epitomises the helter-skelter pace of the bull market, it must be
venture capital investment trusts, which back developing, and mainly
unquoted, companies.
For a long time during recession, the sector seemed to produce nothing but
disastrous news from the likes of Drayton Consolidated, Ensign and Gresham
House, as their portfolios were devastated by corporate bankruptcies. But
over the year to September 1, the average venture capital trust produced a
share price total return of 66.35 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with
net income reinvested; source Micropal.)
A significant transformation in investors' attitudes seems to have occurred
over the past six months. When we wrote about Electra, the largest trust in
the sector, in February, in our series on investment trusts, its shares
stood at a discount of 34 per cent. Now, according to S G Warburg
Securities, the discount has dropped to 15 per cent. The shares, then 214p,
are now 276p.
Electra's results in June were moderately encouraging - a 14.7 per cent rise
in net assets and a 4.5 per cent increase in dividend. Michael Stoddart,
chairman, said in his statement: 'I believe that the worst is over. The
majority of companies in our portfolio look to be set for better times and
we should start to see a gradual increase in the underlying values.
'All in all, while maintaining a cautious approach to the US and UK
economies, I do believe that the outlook for your company is more
encouraging than it has been for some time.'
But the market is evidently taking an even more optimistic view. As John
Symanowski, of SG Warburg Securities, says: 'The asset values of venture
capital trusts tend to lag the rest of the stock market.' First the economy
starts to recover; then the companies owned by the trusts have to complete
their financial years; then those companies have to report improved results
two or three months later; finally trusts, when they revalue their assets,
can translate the improved results into increased asset values.
In short, after a long time during recession, when the markets appeared to
believe that companies were being insufficiently cautious about the value of
their unquoted holdings, investors evidently believe there is scope for
asset values to increase.
There is plenty of room for recovery; Electra's asset value is still below
its level at the end of September 1989.
Robbie Robertson, of NatWest Securities, argues that, after all the problems
experienced in the sector, many trusts adopted a stringent approach to the
valuation of their unquoted holdings. 'There were far more write-downs of
assets than write-ups in the years 1990-92' he says. 'Trusts have cut away
the deadwood in their portfolios.'
Venture capital trusts have also been helped by the revival of smaller
company shares which has occurred during 1993, with the FT Small Cap Index
far outstripping the performance of the Footsie.
Many venture capital trusts own quoted small company shares - usually long
term holdings which they have successfully seen though from development to
flotation. The increase in the prices of these shares flows straight through
into the asset values of the trusts.
Furthermore, the small company revival has led institutions to review their
venture capital weightings, according to Robbie Robertson, and decide there
was a risk involved in being left behind. A venture capital trust represents
a quick way of getting exposure to the sector.
Another important factor, according to Robertson, is the incidence of stock
market listings. 'It's easy for trusts to put money into companies,' he
says, 'they have got to be able to get it out as well.' When companies
float, that results in an immediate uplift to asset values, as the 'discount
for illiquidity' disappears.
All these factors make Robertson believe the revival in the venture capital
sector has been justified. But Warburg's Symanowski takes a different view.
'I think the rally has been overdone. There is not enough sign of a UK
recovery to justify the revival.'
'I wonder how much we will see of the living dead factor' adds Symanowski.
'Some companies have been teetering on the brink and trusts have not written
them off. But as valuations rise across the rest of their portfolios, they
will use the chance for write-offs.'
For those who side with Robertson, rather than Symanowski, the top
performing venture capital trusts over the past year, according to Micropal,
have been SUMIT (up 189 per cent), Murray Enterprise (171.3), Govett
American Endeavour (107.7), Foreign &amp; Colonial Enterprise (105.1) and
Electra (87.8). Over five years, the top five are: Manakin (which is
gradually winding itself down and distributing its assets), Candover (up
202.8 per cent), Pantheon (185.1) Foreign &amp; Colonial Enterprise (146.8) and
Group Development (77.5).

FT  18 SEP 93 / Markets: Something nasty in the long grass - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE an autumn gardener stumbling over a rake, the markets this week
received a sharp, unpleasant blow from a long forgotten source.
The culprit, inflation, had vanished from sight over the summer. Hidden by
long grass and the yellowing heaps of analysts' circulars, it had lost its
power to frighten. The artificially low 'headline' figures for the retail
price index, held down by the cuts in interest rates, showed annual
inflation of 1.4 per cent in July. Such exceptionally low numbers flattered
the figure for underlying inflation, helping to create the belief that
prices were headed remorselessly lower.
This expectation was one of the factors behind the summer rally in bond and
equity markets. The effect is captured in the chart, which shows the
markets' measure of expected inflation (derived by subtracting the yield on
index-linked gilts from the yield on their conventional counterparts). This
line, in steady decline for most of the past year, is mirrored by the rise
in the equity market.
In recent days, however, both lines have moved the other way. The reversal
of trend was particularly abrupt on Wednesday, when the August inflation
numbers appeared, showing a noticeably faster rise in prices than the
consensus expectation. Headline inflation had jumped to 1.7 per cent. The
official measure of underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest
payments, had risen from 2.9 per cent to 3.1 per cent, its highest level
since March. And on a still more pessimistic measure of the price level -
adjusting for the continuing impact of the shift of local taxation - the
figure is 3.6 per cent.
Because it was so unexpected, this fairly small rise in inflation had an
exaggerated impact. The government bond market had its worst day since the
pound left the ERM exactly a year before; the yield on 10-year gilts rose
from 6.86 per cent to 7.04 per cent. The FT-SE 100 index also suffered,
dropping 38.6 points to 2,989.4, its largest one-day fall for seven months.
By the end of the week, with the markets unsettled also by the expiry of the
Footsie futures contract, equities had recovered somewhat. The FT-SE 100
index ended on Friday 3005.5, a drop of 31.5 points on the week. It was
safely back above 3,000, and the scale of the setback was only modest; but
the tone of analysts' comments had changed.
The most famously bullish of their number, Nomura's Nick Knight, was
admitting to a 'more hesitant stance in the short term', which is
analyst-ese for 'Excuse me while I back-pedal'. Bearish commentators, such
as Panmure Gordon's Robin Aspinall, had cranked the tone-knob further
towards gloom: UK equities were 'dangerously exposed,' he said, offering at
best a long period of poor performance, 'and the worst does not bear
thinking about.'
An analysis couched purely in British terms would miss an important part of
the week's news, however. London was not the only equity market to suffer a
sharp setback on Wednesday: Paris fell 2 1/2 per cent, Frankfurt 1 per cent,
Amsterdam 2 per cent. One common influence on all these markets was the
outlook for long-term US interest rates, which moved back above six per cent
this week after their headlong fall throughout the summer. Although the
scale of the US reversal was not great - less significant, to a chartist's
eye, than the move in the UK  - it too was influenced by inflation worries
and it left investors understandably nervousness. Was the turn in the US
interest-rate cycle at hand?
Chris Golden, who watches worldwide bond markets for Lehman Brothers in
London, thinks the worry is overdone. 'People have a gut feeling: 'My God,
these rates are really low,'' he says. But adjusted for inflation, yields
are safely above their long-term average of around 2 1/2 -3 per cent. And UK
yields are in real terms among the highest.
Still, this week's inflation flurry has given investors reason to shift
their attention from the relative yields on stocks and bonds - a comparison
that helped to propel the equity market to its summer highs. If there is a
little more uncertainty than there was over the future direction of
long-term interest rates, that serves to heighten the scrutiny given to UK
earnings. The flow of results and trading comments this week have not stood
up well to such inspection.
On Thursday, in particular, there were worrying announcements by two big
companies. LIG, the condom-maker, made its second profits warning in seven
months; Tony Butterworth, its chief executive, announced that he would be
retiring early. Earlier this year, analysts had been expecting annual
profits of about Pounds 40m. After this week's news of poor trading in the
photo-processing division, they had slashed their forecasts to Pounds 18m,
and the shares fell 63p to 140p in response.
On the face of it the big corporate result of the day, interim figures from
United Biscuits, was more cheerful. Despite recession and fierce price
competition, UB had managed to keep pre-tax profits before exceptionals
moving ahead, even though the gain was only 1 per cent. Investors were not
in a mood to be cheered however: UB shares dropped 37p on the week, closing
at 351p. The results highlighted a margin squeeze at the McVitie's biscuits
division, one of British industry's most famously well-run businesses.
Market share had come under pressure in the first quarter; the division won
it back in the next three months but had to sacrifice profitability to do so
 -and lower margins were likely to persist for the foreseeable future. This
is not the sort of news that a stock market selling at 20 times earnings
likes to hear.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Markets: Laporte impresses sceptics - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKEOVERS have become unfashionable. Academic research suggests that
acquisitive companies seldom achieve the hoped-for benefits. During the last
takeover boom of the late 1980s, companies were often urged into unsuitable
deals by merchant banks more concerned with generating fees than commercial
logic.
The City was therefore pleasantly surprised this week when Laporte, the
speciality chemicals group, announced a rapid improvement in the results of
Evode, the chemicals and plastic group it bought in January.
By cutting Evode's workforce by 8 per cent, closing its headquarters and
drastically slimming the management structure, Laporte obtained operating
profits of Pounds 13.1m from Evode in its first five months with the group -
almost as much as it made in a whole year under the previous management.
The rapid success vindicated the judgment of Ken Winton, Evode's chief
executive, who had to convince a sceptical City that the Evode deal would
enhance Laporte's earnings. Some analysts feared Evode had overpaid when it
came in as a white knight to make an agreed offer of Pounds 129m for Evode,
topping by Pounds 16m a hostile bid from Wassall, the mini-conglomerate.
The acquisition of Evode was, however, only the latest of a series of deals
which have transformed the UK's second largest independent chemical group,
shifting Laporte's focus from commodity chemicals towards high-margin
speciality markets.
Minton says the concept is quite simple. Whereas commodity chemicals are
sold on price alone, specialities are sold for other considerations. The
business differs from bulk chemicals because it is research-orientated,
changing the product to meet the customer's need.
'A speciality customer is prepared to pay more because the supplier has a
monopoly, or has a better product, or his salesmanship is better. A bulk
chemical manufacturer is obsessed by production - cutting costs to improve
margins. But for specialities, marketing becomes far more important than
production chemistry,' he says.
Laporte has focused on five core divisions - organic speciality chemicals;
construction; absorbents and pigments; hygiene and process; metals and
electronics chemicals. The group enjoys an average profit margin of 14 per
cent, and Evode's margins have already been lifted from 4 per cent to double
figures.
Although Laporte's shares jumped by 6 per cent on news of the Evode success,
they are still only trading on a prospective multiple of 15.5 - the market
average. That does no seem overgenerous at this stage in the cycle for a
group which makes 65 per cent of its sales to the recovering economies of
the US and UK, and has only a 25 per cent exposure to the declining
Continental European markets.
While some analysts are convinced by the Laporte restructuring story, others
say the group has a record of promising more than it can deliver. Apart from
Evode, the recent performance of its other business has been fairly flat,
after the impact of acquisitions and currency is removed.
The City was alarmed to discover that debt climbed to Pounds 190m
immediately after the Evode deal, but has since come down to Pounds 170m,
giving Laporte gearing of 57 per cent. It is likely to come down, helped by
tight control on working capital and disposals of unwanted Evode assets.
A further reason for City uncertainty is the bewilderingly wide range of
Laporte's products - everything from cat litter to fine chemicals for the
pharmaceutical industry. No analyst or fund manager can hope to understand
such a diverse range of markets. Observers are also struck by the rapid rate
at which Laporte has changed: more than 80 per cent of the group's business
has come in within the last 10 years.
Laporte promised the City a period of consolidation after the takeover, and
the rapid improvement in Evode's margins is a good start. If Winton can
produce a solid series of trading results from his refocused group, the
share price should benefit.

FT  18 SEP 93 / On patrol in the townships of death: Patti Waldmeir spent a
night on South Africa's front line with the 'self defence unit' of one
embattled black community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We killed him and then we burned his body'.
SHALL I bother to ask why, as though reason can comprehend the primordial
hatred that spurred the deed and the bloodlust that carried it through?
But I cling to reason in this land driven half-mad by violence. I insist on
a rational motive for the deed and it is chillingly simple: this South
African township, Katlehong, is at war, one of the focal points of a
conflict that has left 10,000 blacks dead since 1990. And the dead man was
the enemy.
He was a resident of a migrant workers hostel - which means he was probably
also a Zulu and a member of the Inkatha Freedom Party. And his killers -
these young black men who tell the tale in a cramped township kitchen, while
I perch on a Formica stool and glance nervously at their AK-47 rifles - are
residents of the area surrounding the hostel, who owe allegiance primarily
to the African National Congress.
They are obviously filled with a sense of righteousness at their deed, a
victory in the just war against the cruel aggressor: 'hostel dwellers' they
explain, have killed scores of residents in this section of Katlehong;
burned, looted and destroyed their homes; forced them to flee.
Now the residents have formed a 'self-defence unit' to protect their
territory; and anyone found on the wrong side of the invisible line that
separates 'residents' and 'hostel dwellers' - or ANC and Inkatha, if you
prefer neater, though less accurate labels - courts a gruesome death.
The dead hostel dweller was found well behind enemy lines: at the taxi rank,
in 'residents' territory. On his way home, he was caught, killed and set
alight. When I ask who killed him, the reply is obvious: 'the community'.
Thabo, 27, is the leader of this band of urban guerrillas. Disarmingly shy,
with a slow wide smile and a gentle manner, he inspires no fear; he does not
even tell me to disguise his identity, but I have done so. Still, he is the
one who instructs the others - young men with hard, wild eyes which have
seen too much atrocity - in the art of loading an ammunition clip on to an
AK-47.
It is near midnight, and we are in the kitchen of an abandoned house that
the self-defence unit uses as a base, on the front line with a neighbouring
area colonised by hostel residents. (The latter have established security
zones around the hostels, driving out the residents and setting up their
own, ostensibly defensive bases).
On one side of the eerie, empty street, young men from the self-defence unit
sit in darkened rooms behind incongruous net curtains, their weapons trained
on the houses opposite - where other (usually older) men from the hostels do
the same. Thabo claims to have 15 such bases, 150 fighters, and to have
killed 200 hostel dwellers. We both know he exaggerates, but his point is
clear: the self-defence unit is extensive and relatively well-armed - and it
is winning the just war against the hostels. (Some 200 people were killed in
Katlehong and its contiguous townships of Thokoza and Vosloorus last month,
as well as 400 the previous month, but police do not record the allegiance
of corpses).
Thabo guides me into a pitch-dark sitting room, and cautiously shifts the
net curtain a few centimetres to point out the enemy base opposite. He
recounts numerous recent incidents of police collusion with the
hostel-dwellers - on such-and-such a day they brought Inkatha men in
armoured cars to attack the residents, another night they brought guns to
the hostel fighters, or attacked the residents entirely of their own accord.
Some of the stories must be apocryphal, but they cannot all be untrue. And
it is clear that Thabo's motives for launching the self-defence unit were in
his view unassailably righteous: the community, a tight-knit group that
developed a strong collective identity under apartheid, was under attack
from the hostels; he could not stand by while defenceless women and children
were killed.
But the worst savagery often proceeds from the purest motives, and the just
war is notoriously hard to end. Thabo's troops may not thank him for ending
it, even if he would; for they are the 'lost generation', teenagers who have
known only the fight against apartheid, and now the battle against police
and Inkatha. They clearly enjoy the exalted status which SDU membership
brings, prefering the romanticised life of the guerrilla to the desperate
boredom of the hopeless unemployed.
These young men are my bodyguards as I join one of the unit's nightly
patrols, following a maze of paths between houses that crowd upon each
other, wall to wall, past malodorous outdoor toilets (the water was switched
off earlier in the day), under washing lines in backyards crammed with
rubble, taking cover from snipers behind half-demolished walls. All the
houses are dark - residents observe the SDU's 8.30pm curfew, and black out
windows with blankets - and Thabo explains that he will shoot at anything
that moves.
Luckily, nothing does. It is a quiet night. Occasionally, Thabo scratches
quietly at a back door, and a resident lets us silently into a warm kitchen
where the patrol deposits me for a while. One terrified resident after
another tells a horrifying tale of daily life in Katlehong: the fear, the
nights of shooting, the ever-present danger; the gratitude to the SDU, which
has substantially improved security. Then we are out again into the night,
squeezing through fence gaps, waking up the dogs, sprinting across wide dirt
streets open to snipers. A police armoured vehicle trundles by, with its
powerful spotlights trained on the houses; we freeze, a single shot rings
out (not aimed at us, they have not seen us), and then move on.
When I decide I have had enough, sometime in the early hours, Thabo sends
two young runners to negotiate my safe passage out of the township with the
neighbouring self-defence unit; they might otherwise shoot at an alien
vehicle breaking curfew.
But before I go, he has some serious complaints to lodge against Nelson
Mandela, the ANC leader. Thabo was a member of the South African Communist
Party, the ANC's staunchest ally. But the SACP 'betrayed the struggle of the
working class' to the ANC, whose moderation he condemns, and so he has
joined the 'Communist International'. He opposes negotiation, resents
Mandela for suspending the armed struggle and leaving Katlehong residents
unprotected, and thinks the ANC should go back into exile. Mandela cannot
control him, and neither can the police; how will the new South Africa
survive him?
But it would be wrong to suggest that Thabo is the only, or even the worst,
threat to post-apartheid Katlehong. For every party to the conflict believes
that right is on its side; they excuse the most ghastly acts on the grounds
of just cause.
That cause is not ideological, nor theological, nor even truly 'political';
their battle is for survival. Wilson, a young resident of Madala hostel in
Thokoza, puts it simply: 'They think we are going to attack them and we
think they are going to attack us.' Residents think the hostel dwellers want
their homes; and hostel residents think the residents want the hostels
demolished. For both, poor people who live perilously close to the edge of
survival, housing is a life-and-death issue.
Even the police have seen 1,000 of their members killed in the past decade
as part of an anti-apartheid strategy to kill security force members, and
they too know fear.
But the triple township - Katlehong, Thokoza and Vosloorus are known
administratively as 'Katorus' - was relatively quiet until 1990, in spite of
its desperate poverty, intense competition for housing, high population
density and low employment. Something set them at each other's throats, and
no one knows for certain what it was.
Most experts believe that the already high level of socio-economic rivalry
was ignited by the political competition set off by the release from prison
of Mandela in 1990. ANC branches were formed, IFP strengthened its presence,
and political leaders from both sides inflamed passions with aggressive
rhetoric. Repeated massacres, carried out by shadowy characters never
apprehended by police, kept tensions at boiling point and suggested the
involvement of a 'third force' from the right wing or the police. Though
Judge Richard Goldstone found no evidence of such a force in a 1992 report
into Thokoza violence, most township residents still believe it exists.
Inkatha, for its part, says the ANC launched a campaign to 'wipe out the
Zulus', giving the early conflict a strong ethnic flavour as Zulus in the
hostels fought Xhosas in squatter camps and in the main township. Since that
time, the hostels have been ethnically cleansed, with only Zulus daring to
remain and many Zulus from the township withdrawing into the hostels for
protection. But though an ethnic element remains, it is far from clear-cut:
many of the SDU members are also Zulus, including Thabo.
Hostel dwellers now feel just as threatened as Thabo and his residents:
besieged within the hostels, they believe the ANC wants their homes
demolished (Thabo is certain they will be levelled before next year's
elections); they also complain of police harassment, and ask why - if the
police are on their side - they have not defeated the ANC-supporting
residents long ago.
Peter Harris, director of the Wits-Vaal Peace Secretariat, which maintains
permanent peace monitors in the area, says: 'There is a powerful cocktail of
ingredients in the social makeup of (the area) that contributes to the
violence: a complete disintegration of civil society; a large criminal
element that uses violence as a shield; a total breakdown in law and order;
intense political confrontation; conflict around housing.' The list goes on
and on.
But possibly the worst problem of all is the belief among residents that the
police are the real enemy, worse even than Inkatha. Residents do not believe
police will protect them, so they form self-defence units; they will not
co-operate with police, so crimes are not solved.
Until they trust the security forces - and until police give them cause to
do so - violence can only drag on.
                *                *               *
'Time for our regular dose of adrenalin,' says Police Sergeant Jakes
Bleeker, as he pulls up beside the moonlit shacks of Thokoza's Phola Park
squatter camp. He is driving a Nyala armoured personnel carrier filled with
members of the police riot unit, the Internal Stability Division. 'If we sit
here long enough they always shoot at us,' he says; behind us, their assault
rifles at the ready, young constables taunt the shack residents in
Afrikaans: 'Come, shoot at us,' they cry out, not even trying to conceal
their lust for action. If they will go this far with a journalist present, I
wonder what they will do when I have gone.
During eight hours of night-time patrol, I (not surprisingly) see them
commit none of the much-rumoured atrocities. But I leave with a new
understanding of why township residents complain of harassment,
intimidation, insults. And the events I saw at Phola Park lends credence to
the claim that police often shoot at residents - with little, or no
provocation.
But the real problem is their attitude. Maybe they too have been brutalised
by violence; but when we stop to collect a dead body, they laugh and joke in
the face of the bereaved husband and sister; when they dump the body on to a
stretcher, they do not notice that the wind has blown her skirt up above her
waist (the husband hastily reaches forward to make her decent); they look
for no witnesses, ask no questions, merely collect a cartridge for
ballistics testing. They assure me that 'these people' don't even notice
death any more; and neither do the police, nor, one suspects, do they try
very hard to stop it.
With the best will in the world, they could not in any case: there are too
many guns, too much hatred, too many scores to be settled. One can only weep
for the people of 'Katorus'; their lives are unending nightmare. The new
South Africa, from which they expect so much, can do little for them.

FT  18 SEP 93 / The Long View: The Norman inquest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY THIS week articles began to appear celebrating the UK's year outside
the European exchange rate mechanism. It had all gone better than anybody
could have expected, with the economy returning to growth, and inflation
running much lower than most people can have expected after the substantial
devaluation on Black (sorry, Golden) Wednesday. Moreover the feared crises
over public sector funding and the balance of payments deficit simply had
not happened. The great and the good in Britain, including the captains of
industry, are now in favour of a floating currency.
On Thursday, moreover, a director of Rothschilds called Norman Lamont burst
into anniversary print to declare that the UK had gone into the ERM for all
the wrong reasons. The man who once assured us that there would be no
devaluations, no leaving the ERM, is now urging John Major to pull the UK
out of the plan for European economic and monetary union.
The one-year-on celebrations, however, had a strange familiarity. They read
uncannily like the articles that appeared at the beginning of October 1991
to celebrate the first anniversary of the UK's ERM entry. It had all gone
better than anybody could have expected. Inflation was tumbling, interest
rates were falling steadily, and sterling had stayed within its band without
strain. As for falling gross domestic product and rising unemployment, they
were prices well worth paying (by other people, anyway). The great and the
good, especially those captains of industry, were almost unanimously
pro-ERM.
In fact, Britain's ERM honeymoon ended almost as soon as the first birthday
cake had been consumed. Sterling suddenly crashed to the bottom of the ERM
grid, and the struggle against unequal odds began in earnest. We never quite
got to the moment for lighting two candles. This week, too, an anniversary
jinx spoiled the party. The industrial production figures were revised
downwards, unemployment edged up again, inflation jumped back above 3 per
cent on an underlying basis, and the Footsie index slipped temporarily back
under 3,000 - albeit on a wave of profit-taking in international bond
markets.
Now, this is not put forward as evidence that economic strategies have a
one-year shelf life. I suspect that we are going to discover that an economy
cannot be satisfactorily run through violent changes in strategy, and that
we should not allow ourselves to be misled by the time lags that are
involved, so that we have benefited from the ERM's disinflation long after
we have left it. As Bill Martin, of UBS, puts it, if devaluing the pound and
cutting interest rates were all that were required the UK would have a
world-beating economy.
After a year back in a floating rate regime there are signs that some of the
bad old ways of the UK economy are reasserting themselves. Pay growth in
manufacturing, the most buoyant sector of the economy at present, may have
bottomed out at around 5 per cent, giving an indication of what may happen
when the services sector recovers.
There is bound to be fierce resistance to the Government's rather feeble
attempt this week to impose a semi-freeze on public sector pay. After a year
in which inflation has almost always undershot expectations it has started
to forge ahead again, and the prospect that the headline rate, boosted by
indirect tax increases, might top 3 1/2 per cent next year is cooling the
market's hopes of an interest rate cut this autumn, at any rate one that is
unaccompanied by significant tax increases and deficit reduction.
The low level of inflation has not, however, been entirely good news - not
for the corporate sector anyway. In spite of the latest spell of weakness
the Footsie index remains 26 per cent above its level at the close on Black
Wednesday (and 32 per cent higher than at the low point in August a few
weeks earlier, when the market began to scent the imminent change of
course). The upsurge has been founded upon the scope for companies to raise
their prices and their profitability. But it has been very difficult in
practice for companies to pass on higher costs in the domestic market place
and some sectors - food manufacturing, for instance - have been squeezed.
So the current profits reporting season has been a little disappointing, and
certainly the prospects for a large increase in manufacturing investment in
the UK to cure our underlying trade deficit do not look bright. True, the
manufacturing productivity figures are very good but low wages and layoffs
do not promise a convincing route to long-term prosperity. Rapid output
growth would be much better, but it does not look a likely prospect.
Depressed Continental Europe remains the big problem here, as business
surveys are highlighting. We can break free of the ERM but we can scarcely
escape from the constraints of weak European demand. And for all the fuss
about the ERM crisis at the end of July, and the switch to wide currency
fluctuation bands, more than half the EC member states have short-term
interest rates at 9 per cent or more.
Although the foreign exchange speculators have been away sunning themselves
and counting their profits they must now be tempted to have another go at
individual currencies. The bond market shakeout may reflect fears that
countries like France and Belgium will, after all, remain obstinately
trapped in the economic doldrums.
We can float, but we may not be able to beat the tide. In any case, the bond
market itself is becoming an important source of financial linkage between
economies. The British government, for instance, is estimated to have
financed anything up to 40 per cent of its fiscal deficit this year by
selling bonds to foreign investors. Foreigners hold 17 per cent of the
outstanding debt, and they expect prudent policies. Even outside the ERM
freedom is relative.

FT  18 SEP 93 / US expected to press EC for faster cuts in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is expected to urge France and other European Community countries to
make faster cuts in interest rates when finance ministers and central bank
governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations meet in
Washington next Saturday.
European monetary officials say the US has said in preparatory talks that it
is disturbed at the slow easing of monetary conditions among Germany's
partners in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) after the currency
crisis in July and August.
The US has argued that the ERM member states had been forced into too tight
a policy position by linking their currencies closely to the D-Mark. Now
that fluctuation margins have been expanded to 15 per cent either side of
the ERM central rates, some US officials want interest rate cuts of perhaps
one percentage point at a time in countries such as France, rather than the
cautious cuts made so far.
Underlying the US stance - which is likely to be supported by other nations
attending the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank in Washington at the end of this month - is concern about the sluggish
economic recovery in the industrialised world.
The next issue of the IMF's World Economic Outlook, to be published in
Washington on Wednesday, is expected to revise downwards the growth forecast
for the industrialised world next year to about 2 1/4 per cent from nearly 3
per cent in April.
In Helsinki yesterday, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, chief economist of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, said it now expects
growth in its 24 industrialised member states will be only about 1 per cent
this year compared with 1.2 per cent forecast in July.
It is understood that the latest IMF growth forecasts for the US and Japan
have been revised downwards since the first calculations were circulated in
August.
The IMF expects practically no growth for Japan this year, holding out the
possibility of a full-blown recession.
In Washington, Britain and other countries are expected to press for a
speedy and successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks as a way of strengthening global growth prospects.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Unions split on plan to freeze public-sector pay: GMB fears
attempt to 'trap' workers into strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIVISIONS emerged yesterday among trade unions opposed to the government's
plan to freeze public-sector pay next year.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said strike action by
public-sector workers might play into the hands of the government. His
warning is likely to anger the more militant leaders of Unison, the 1.4m
strong public-service union, and the smaller Fire Brigades Union, who favour
industrial action.
The split appeared as unions representing more than half a million nursing
staff submitted a 10 per cent pay claim and come just days before a TUC
meeting to discuss opposition to the freeze. Earlier this week, teachers
called for an 8 per cent increase and a Pounds 1,000 one-off payment.
Mr Edmonds told a conference of Labour councillors in Manchester yesterday:
'The chancellor's pay freeze is an attempt to trap public-sector workers
into a strike and to take the spotlight off his own difficulties.'
Mr Jack Dromey, the chief local government officer of the Transport and
General Workers' Union, said: 'It is clear that part of the government's
agenda is to trap us and thereby trap the Labour party.'
Together, the two big general unions represent 500,000 of the 5.5m
public-sector workers, but they will carry disproportionate influence on the
TUC committee.
The nurses and teachers have submitted their claims to their pay review
bodies. Doctors, the armed forces and top civil servants have still to
submit claims.
None of the bodies, which are independent of the government and make
recommendations on pay, has yet met to consider the implications of the
Treasury's freeze. This week Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said pay
rises in the public sector would be allowed only in exchange for
productivity increases.
The unions say productivity is impossible to measure in many parts of the
public sector. Ms Judith Carter, of Unison, said yesterday: 'We find no
evidence that performance-related pay will improve service quality.'
Many public-sector managers welcome the shift to more local bargaining,
which is likely to be one consequence of the pay arrangements for 1994-95.
The civil service agencies, such as the Benefits Agency, are already
scheduled to take control of pay bargaining for more than 250,000 civil
servants next year.
They are also expected to make efficiency savings of 2.5 per cent, and some
managers fear that further efficiency gains will be clawed back by the
Treasury rather than paid to staff.
Ms Susanne Brierley, head of the organisation representing personnel
managers in NHS trusts, welcomed the greater flexibility that should be
provided by moving away from a pay norm.

FT  18 SEP 93 / China hint of Atlanta Olympics boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOP Chinese official warned yesterday that his country might boycott the
1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta unless Beijing was chosen to host the Games in
2000.
As delegates gathered in Monaco for the annual meeting of the International
Olympic Committee, which will decide among five contenders on Thursday, Mr
Zhang Baifa, chief executive of the Beijing Olympic bid committee, said that
in his view a boycott was possible because of political interference by the
US House of Representatives, which voted in July to oppose China's bid on
human rights grounds.
In Beijing, however, an official said those comments were 'definitely not
the position' of the Chinese committee. Mr Zhang's remarks, which he
confirmed to Reuter in Monte Carlo, were made in an Australian television
interview to be screened today. Odds on Sydney to host the Games shortened
yesterday, with William Hill, the London bookmaker, offering 11-8 compared
with 11-4.
Beijing remains the favourite at 8-11, with Berlin at 5-1, Manchester at 7-1
and Istanbul the outsider at 100-1. Berlin's already battered cause was
weakened by midweek bomb explosions which damaged premises of those
sponsoring the city's campaign - some in Berlin oppose the bid on grounds of
expense. The chances of Amsterdam as a 1986 candidate were irreparably
damaged by protesters throwing paint and flour bombs at the Olympic elite as
they entered meetings.
It seems likely that the majority of African IOC members will support
Beijing.

FT  18 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Profit warnings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After London International's 31 per cent fall on Thursday, yesterday it was
Proudfoot's turn to fall 40 per cent on poor interim figures and a profit
warning. Such violent reactions lend support to those who argue that the
stricter climate on corporate disclosure is counter-productive. LIG, in
particular, had become so tight-lipped since it was censured by the Stock
Exchange in May that investors had no apparent inkling of what was going on.
Yet it was clear when LIG issued its results in June that a wet summer would
wreak further damage to its important photo-processing business. At least it
issued a statement virtually as soon as that non-summer was over.
Using formal statements to improve equality of access to information
inevitably makes share prices more volatile in the short term. One mistake
is to assume that this is to the detriment of small investors who are
usually long-term holders. How the information comes out will make little
difference to where the price finally settles. By contrast it is large
institutions that benefit from private individual briefings designed to
smooth the market. The bad news, when it comes, is less of a shock but they
will have had a chance to take their profits first.
The other mistake is for companies to assume that a greater focus on formal
statements means their lips must be sealed at other times. The more
information they put formally in the public domain, the less they have to
fear from answering analysts' questions.

FT  18 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of bubbles and market crashes are all the rage this season, though it
is a little hard to understand why. True, money has been shifting from
low-risk bank deposits to bonds and shares, stretching valuations somewhat.
But while there has been a shift in the mix of financial assets held, there
is little sign of the margin-trading and grotesque overvaluation which
characterises genuine speculative booms.
Indeed, a moderate asset-price inflation may be beneficial. Private-sector
balance sheets were severely strained by high borrowings and falling asset
prices in the recession. To the extent that rising asset prices increase
wealth, that problem is eased. Such asset-price rises only become a general
inflationary threat if they encourage consumers to use their increased
wealth as collateral for unsustainable borrowing and consumption.
Such an outcome looks extremely unlikely. The current level of asset prices
thus gives little reason for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
With the US economy still growing below its long-run productive potential,
and demand in the world economy subdued, near-term inflationary fears look
overdone. Indeed, disappointing first-half, and potentially third-quarter,
US growth figures might argue for a further easing. Hopes of stronger growth
will, however, probably keep Fed policy on hold until 1994. A rise in
interest rates then as the economy grows is a more credible threat to market
valuations than a bursting bubble now.

FT  18 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is too early to conclude that the positive factors which have propelled
UK equities are fading, but the market has lost its easy confidence. The
proximate cause is economic data suggesting that inflation is, if not
resurgent, at least reluctant to lie down and die. One month's figures do
not constitute a trend, but gilts tumbled nonetheless. With the equity
market already backpedalling after making strong gains last month, the FT-SE
100 index fell below 3,000 for the first time since August 11.
While both the equity and bond markets have regained a measure of composure,
there are good reasons to be cautious about gilts in particular. The auction
announced yesterday is the first hurdle. A maturity of around 10 years is
pitched to attract overseas interest, but it remains to be seen whether
foreign buyers come forward in any numbers. Gilts no longer offer such an
attractive yield premium over French or German government bonds. Neither
does sterling offer much prospect of a currency gain. Either way, the run-up
to the auction on September 29 will do nothing for frayed nerves.
In theory, the yield gap is sufficiently comfortable to allow equities to
progress even if gilts are becalmed. In practice, that will require
inspiration from company results, which has been lacking so far. With the
big food retailers starting to report figures and President Clinton's
healthcare reforms due to be announced next week, there is scope for more
disappointment in some of the least popular sectors.

FT  18 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler loses its shine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any company with annual sales approaching DM100bn, and half-year profits of
only DM168m has got a problem. Under US accounting practice, however,
Daimler-Benz loses the magic of released provisions and other convenient
adjustments. The US-style loss of DM949m is a much better measure of the
size of the difficulty facing the company. Daimler is apparently moving to
cut the losses, yet the 12 per cent cut in staff numbers announced yesterday
will be phased over three years. With conditions in the European motor
industry abysmal, most, if not all, of those cost savings will be lost to
competitive pressures.
Even if more painful cuts are made, European unit production costs are much
higher than those in the far east, and that gap may prove unbridgeable. In
some ways Mercedes-Benz's position is even worse than that of Volkswagen
since the luxury car market is under threat both from Japanese competition
and the trend towards smaller cars. And as much of the allure of buying a
Mercedes is in its dependable German construction, the company is in a
double bind. Were production transferred elsewhere, the brand's cachet could
be compromised.
In fairness, Daimler recognised some of the strategic threat when it
diversified into aerospace and electronics. Yet its expensive purchases have
proved poor value, and have failed to protect the company from the
automotive cycle. They may also have distracted management attention from
the central problem facing its car business at a critical time. Flotations
in New York and rights issues in Europe will not avail Daimler if the
company's heart ceases to beat.

FT  18 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks fall sharply on
futures expiry
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
HEAVY selling related to 'triple-witching' (the quarterly expiration of
equity derivatives contracts) sent share prices tumbling in extremely heavy
trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 17.61 at 3,613.24.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.56 lower at 458.87, while
the Amex composite was down 0.87 at 452.81, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.31
at 740.11. Trading volume on the NYSE was well above normal levels at 370m
shares.
Stock markets ended a trying week on a downbeat note, although the early
losses were primarily the result of technical, not fundamental, pressures on
prices. Yesterday was triple-witching day, when stock and stock index
futures and options contracts all expire on the same day. Traditionally,
triple-witching creates substantial volatility in prices, often biased
toward selling.
Yesterday was no exception, and was in fact busier than most such days. The
sell orders piled up before the opening, creating order imbalances in scores
of leading stocks.
When trading started, prices tumbled, leaving the Dow 17 points lower within
minutes. At 10am, trading volume stood at 159m shares, making it the busiest
half-hour in the New York Stock Exchange.
Although prices often recover at the end of the session on triple-witching
day, analysts warned that the mood of the markets was sombre and that prices
could stay at their lows for all of the session.
Declines in bond prices did not help sentiment, and although bonds recovered
slightly in mid-afternoon, equities did not follow suit.
Among individual stocks, Westinghouse tumbled Dollars 1 to Dollars 13 7/8 in
volume of 3.2m shares after the company warned analysts to expect a 50 per
cent drop in its third quarter earnings, and said that it did not foresee an
early improvement in its business outlook.
General Motors slumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 in volume of 2m
shares on newspaper reports that Ford's wage agreement with employee unions
is not good news for General Motors. In contrast, Ford was up Dollars 1/4 at
Dollars 54 3/4 , and Chrysler was unchanged at Dollars 45.
Paramount Communications jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 68 3/8 in volume of
3.2m shares after Turner Broadcasting confirmed that it is interested in
making an offer for Paramount, which is already the subject of an agreed
Dollars 8.2bn bid from Viacom. Turner 'A' shares ended down Dollars 5/8 to
Dollars 25 3/4. Drug stocks also bucked the trend, primarily because they
were hard hit by selling earlier in the week. Schering-Plough rose Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 62 5/8 , Merck held steady at Dollars 31 3/8, Johnson&amp;Johnson
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 39 1/8 and Bristol Myers-Squibb firmed Dollars 1/2
to Dollars 58 3/8.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed lower in moderate trading, finishing out a
see-saw week on a negative note.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index fell 9.75 points to close
at 3,978.31. Declining issues outnumbered advances 337 to 333. On the week,
the index lost about 23 points.
Volume today was 64.976m shares, down from Thursday's 86.632m shares.

<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTMENT over the government's failure to include income tax cuts in
Thursday's emergency economic package affected sentiment, and share prices
lost ground on selling by arbitrageurs and corporate investors, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 111.11 to 20,391.04 after a high of 20,532.65 just
after the market opening, and a low of 20,305.33 in the afternoon as
institutional investors moved to realise profits ahead of the September 30
book closing.
Volume was 295.3m shares against 259m. Declines outpaced advances by 674 to
296 with 195 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell
5.75 to 1,651.34 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.37 to
1,259.67.
The Y6,150bn economic package is seen as containing little actual inflow of
funds into the economy. The failure of the Bank of Japan to cut its official
discount rate has also discouraged investors. Traders hope that the round of
recent selling ahead of the mid-term book closing will have run its course
by next week. However, some market participants remain pessimistic over the
economy and do not expect a rush to buy shares.
Large capital shares faced profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the day's most
active issue, fell Y5 to Y331 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost Y2 to
Y685.
Electronics companies were also lower. Sony fell Y90 to Y4,350, Hitachi
declined Y17 to Y833 and NEC lost Y10 to Y955.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y5,000 to Y886,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 216.38 to 22,499.53 in volume of 89.5m
shares.
Roundup
THERE was no trading in Hong Kong yesterday because of a severe storm.
TAIWAN rose 4.7 per cent after the central bank cut the reserve requirements
of the country's commercial banks, and later a number of banks announced
further cuts in interest rates.
The index jumped 176.48 to 3,941.49, but off an intra-session high of
3,963.90. The index has gained 1.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was
TDollars 30bn, its highest level since May.
Financial sector stocks led the day's rally, rising by 5.8 per cent. China
Steel was the most heavily traded stock, ending 90 cents up at TDollars
18.80.
MANILA hit a record high in an across-the-board rally spurred by Philippine
Long Distance Telephone, up 15 pesos to 1,375 pesos, following a strong
advance in New York.
The composite index climbed 20.64 to 1,996.37 in combined turnover of 723.1m
pesos, for a 4 per cent rise over the week.
AUSTRALIA turned sharply higher after recent falls, helped by BHP's strong
first quarter profit results and firmer gold stocks. The All Ordinaries rose
22.9 to 1,925.5, but was 0.8 per cent lower on the week. BHP advanced 52
cents to ADollars 15.96 after reporting a 22.1 per cent rise in net profit
to ADollars 316.1m in the August quarter.
SEOUL saw a mild technical rebound after the retreats of the three previous
sessions and the composite stock index added 1.95 to 688.34, 1.1 per cent
lower on the week.
Exporters were helped by a trade ministry forecast that Japan's economic
stimulus package would boost South Korea's export performance by Dollars
500m, while reports that the country expected its largest ever steel trade
surplus helped steelmakers to advance.
SINGAPORE edged higher as the consolidation continued and the Straits Times
industrial index rose 7.67 to 2,008.38 after picking up from an intra-day
low of 1,996.31, 0.5 per cent higher on the week.
BOMBAY was higher on sustained buying by both Indian and foreign
institutional investors and the BSE 30 share index rose 17.15 to 2,763.59,
up 2.1 per cent in the week.
NEW ZEALAND weakened in light trading, as Telecom shares lost 5 cents to
NZDollars 4.10. The NZSE-40 capital index shed 23.38 to 1,945.23 in turnover
of NZDollars 29.3m.

FT  18 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Portugal's rally ignited by lower
interest rates - Emerging market funds have also been taking a closer look
at the equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a startling rise from a low of 1,707 in mid-May to a peak of 2,688 on
September 10, Lisbon's Bank of Totta &amp; Acores (BTA) share index fell to
2,459 yesterday, as the market continued its correction following its
biggest advance since 1987.
Analysts are convinced that this downturn will be limited. 'Unless their is
a disaster outside the country, the index should remain pretty stable until
the end of the year,' says Mr Rodrigo Marques Guimaraes, director of Midas,
the independent brokers.
The main factor behind Portugal's equity boom has been interest rates, which
have fallen considerably more sharply than in the rest of Europe. Prime bank
lending rates have fallen from around 20 per cent at the beginning of the
year to 13.75 per cent, while the Bank of Portugal's main absorption rate
has lost 400-basis points over the same period, falling to 10.8 per cent.
'The fundamentals were all there. We were just waiting for something to
ignite the market,' says Mr Joaquim Luiz Gomes, a manager at Midas.
'Interest rates were the spark that lit the fire.'
Another key influence has been the growing interest of emerging market funds
in Portugal. The country is now included in the IFC index for emerging
markets.
'These funds follow the Portuguese market on a continuous basis and have
brought in a great amount of liquidity,' says Mr Luiz Gomes. 'Being included
in a core index has been a tremendous boost for Portugal. Foreign investors
are no longer just moving in and out when the pickings are not so good
elsewhere.'
Today, Portugal has to be compared with markets such as Turkey, Jordan,
Greece and Thailand. And market operators believe that the conditions in
Portugal compare very favourably with other emerging markets in terms of the
sophistication of the trading system, investor protection, ease of
settlement and the availability of information.
Another reason for the surge is the medium-term outlook for the economy.
'International organisations like the OECD and the EC are forecasting
positive growth for Portugal in 1994 and investors are discounting that
growth now,' says Mr Rui Martins dos Santos, chief economist of Banco
Portugues de Investimento.
Even companies with poor half-year profits are selling well on the basis of
this expected growth. But eventually companies will have to deliver.
'Eventually investors will stop focusing on interest rates and start looking
at the fundamentals of individual stocks,' says Mr Luiz Gomes, 'that is when
they will want to see the better economic environment translate into better
earnings.'
Mr Martins dos Santos believes that investors are finding Portuguese shares
cheap. But he points out that many shares, except in the banking sector, are
now overvalued.
Domestic investors are also moving strongly back into equities as bonds
yields have fallen from 18-20 per cent to around 10 per cent.
It is estimated that the value of institutional investment in Portugal is
around Esc1,300bn (Dollars 7.9bn), of which 5 per cent is placed in
equities. 'Even a one per cent swing of institutional investors towards
equities makes a tremendous impact on liquidity,' says Mr Marques Guimaraes.
The liquidity of the market is a telling indicator of how it has progressed
over the past year. In January, the average daily turnover was Dollars
2-2.5m; today it stands at Dollars 10-15m. From 1989 until the present rally
the country suffered from being the worst performing market in Europe.
An additional factor is the very low liquidity of some companies. They are
so easily manipulated that a rally in the market can increase their price by
100 to 200 per cent almost overnight.
Industrial Portugal has clearly out performed the banking sector in the
recent boom. If prices have risen some 40 per cent overall, analysts say
that the industrial sector has grown about 70 per cent and the financial
sector only 30 per cent.
This has a lot to do with how foreign investors perceive Portugal.
'Non-resident fund managers tend to see the country as an infrastructure
story, with growth based on construction fuelled by huge inflows of EC
structural funds,' comments Mr Marques Guimaraes.
Investors are more wary of the banking sector, where they fear that falling
interest rates will hurt profits and are also worried about a rise in
non-performing loans. But market watchers believe that banks have a bright
future as investors take profits after the recent boom and begin to
rearrange their portfolios.
Bank credit will grow as the economy picks up and products new to Portugal,
such as mortgage lending and consumer credit, are introduced. Even on a
profit decline of 40 per cent, BPI has shown a 17 per cent return on
earnings, with inflation at 5.6 per cent.
Indicating the reach of the current correction, Soares da Costa, a leading
construction company, has already lost some 20 per cent after peaking at
Esc4,900 in August, for example. Although it must be taken into account that
the share price has doubled since the beginning of the year.
Analysts believe there will now be some profit-taking and repositioning of
portfolios. 'Investors will be choosing their equities on a more selective
basis but the medium- and long-term outlook for the market remains bright,'
Mr Luiz Gomes believes.

FT  18 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses end the
week on a higher note
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OPTIONS expiry affected trading in a number of continental markets
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's rise of nearly 1.5 per cent was driven both by technical trading
from the options and futures exchanges and a sharp rise in Daimler as
traders covered short positions after the release of the group's interim
results. A revival of the dollar also helped sustain sentiment.
The DAX index closed up 26.32 at 1,881.99, for a week's rise of 1 per cent.
Turnover was DM12.5bn.
However, a broker at Commerzbank said that he did not expect the market to
maintain the up-trend since there had been an absence of institutional funds
and genuine buy orders yesterday.
Daimler was the most actively traded stock, outperforming the market largely
as a result of a short squeeze. The interim figures came in much in line
with forecasts and the shares closed up DM19.00 or 2.7 per cent at DM721.50.
PARIS saw turnover pick up after mid-session, but trading remained generally
uninspired. The 1 per cent rise in the CAC-40 index was put down partly to
technical factors given the absence of many fund managers. The index closed
up 23.86 at 2,099.50, a week's rise of just 0.4 per cent. Turnover was
around FFr3bn.
St Gobain gained FFr15 to FFr572 as investors were encouraged by better than
expected half year data.
AMSTERDAM added ground with the CBS Tendency index gaining 0.4 to 124.0,
barely changed on the week.
Hoogovens rose Fl 1.20 to Fl 45.60 after announcing that it had won a French
contract.
Nedlloyd lost 10 cents to Fl 43.10: it announced further restructuring in
Europe.
ZURICH moved ahead amid renewed talk of lower interest rates but shares were
unable to hold on to their best levels and the SMI index finished 10.8
higher at 2,385.2, 0.9 per cent higher on the week.
Zurich Insurance put on SFr20 to SFr1,176 as it unveiled half yearly figures
that were at the top end of expectations and forecast higher 1993 profits.
Bearer shares of SMH, the watchmaker, continued under pressure, losing SFr32
to SFr1,045 with investors awaiting an announcement on the future of the
Swatchmobile ecological car project.
Saurer, the textile machinery and technology group, tumbled SFr90 to
SFr2,290 in spite of its announcement of favourable 1993 first-half figures.
MILAN picked itself up after Thursday's fall as domestic investors returned
and the Mibtel index rose 50 to 10,350. The Comit index was unavailable
yesterday.
The prospect of further rights issues remained a worry. Italmobiliare shed
L1,495 or 3.6 per cent to L39,805 in further response to its plans.
Fiat dipped L78 to L5,897 but Snia, the chemicals and synthetic fibres
subsidiary, rose L39 or 3.2 per cent to L1,256 in response to better than
expected first half results.
Ferruzzi traded limit down for the sixth successive session, the share
shedding L29.75 or 10 per cent to L265.
Sme, the foods group and privatisation candidate, shed L49 to L4,141, after
reports that bids for its Autogrill restaurant chain and GS supermarkets had
been rejected as unsatisfactory.
STOCKHOLM was slightly firmer as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 1.1 to
1,264.6 with the shipping sector showing the day's biggest advance. Stena
gained SKr3.50 to SKr47.50.
BRUSSELS turned lower in heavy trading after a session dominated by basket
trading linked to the expiry of September options contracts. The Bel-20
index finished 6.35 lower at 1,301.66, although 1.5 per cent higher on the
week.
Glaverbel, the glass maker, surged BFr110 to BFr3,750 ahead of its
first-half earnings publication, which showed a BFr1.78bn group net loss.

FT  18 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous close to the trading account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPIRY DAY in the derivatives markets brought brief turmoil in share prices
yesterday as the big international securities houses competed to balance
their investment exposures to equities, futures and index options.
The settlement passed off more comfortably than had been feared. Leading
Japanese and US houses appeared to be sellers of stock with a leading Swiss
house active on the other side of the balance.
But apprehension revived as London braced itself for the opening of the new
trading account. The Footsie Index faces a testing time on Monday morning,
when twenty Footsie stocks will trade in ex dividend form and three new
entrants join the 100 stock list.
After falling 12 Footsie points in early trading, the stock market moved
upwards during the futures expiry to show, at the day's best, a gain of 16.5
at 3,020.4. But this largely technical rally melted away as Wall Street,
facing its own Triple Witching Hour, made a slow start, with many leading
shares making a delayed opening, and the Dow Index 17 points off in UK
hours.
The closing reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,005.5, with the day's gain cut
back to only 1.6 points. The Footsie has fallen by nearly 32 points this
week on concerns over inflation and disappointing company trading reports.
Over the two week account which closed last night, the Footsie has shed
51.18 points. But it has fallen 109 points, or 3.5 per cent since the
trading peak of 3,115 reached on August 31.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which gained 4.5 to 3,425.7 yesterday, has lost 1.5
per cent over the trading account.
Against the background of technical factors in both London and New York,
market analysts were loath to draw conclusions from share price movements
yesterday.
Weakness among retail and consumer stocks continued to reflect waning
confidence that UK base rates can be cut in the near term. Reports of US
sellers unsettled oil shares but some leading pharmaceuticals, which have
proved still vulnerable to worries over US healthcare policies, moved
firmer.
Long-dated government bonds turned sharply high towards the close, showing
half point gains following the announcement that the next auction will be on
September 29, with stock details and when-issued trading next Tuesday.

FT  18 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOUBLE expiry in both the futures and traded options went off smoothly
and was followed by strong two-way business with the sellers eventually
gaining the upper hand, writes Joel Kibazo.
After a brief spate of selling, the September futures contract duly expired
at 10.30 am, finishing trading at 3,008 and a closing volume of 3,627.
Attention then turned to December and having opened at 3,003, strong demand
from the leading houses, including Salomons, James Capel, and a leading
Swiss house, the contract leapt forward, reaching the day's high of 3,050
just ahead of midday.
However, selling from those same houses and from some of the leading
independents saw earlier gains relinquished and a poor Wall Street only
served to increase the selling. December closed at 3,007, at an 11-point
discount to fair value which stands at 18 points. Volume was 16,112.
Expiry of the index options was the main event in traded options and it
passed off comfortably. Total volume reached 36,408.

FT  18 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewing deal seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation intensified that the long-running saga over the sale by Grand
Metropolitan of its Chef &amp; Brewer chain will soon be resolved, with
Whitbread emerging as the main contender.
Drinks analysts said sources close to the negotiations indicated that the
two sides were near to an agreement which would involve Whitbread buying
around 1,050 pubs and restaurants for about Pounds 700m. The remaining 550
outlets are likely to be bought by management. The speculation received
further credence yesterday from an article in the trade press quoting Chef
and Brewer sources that such a deal was being finalised. Whitbread said it
never commented on market rumours.
GrandMet shares gained 6 to 427p and Whitbread A's 4 to 544p, with turnover
in both stocks above average. The speculation drew attention to how
Whitbread might fund such a deal. Mr Eric Frankis at Hoare Govett believes
the group would opt for the sale of its 50 per cent share in the Whitbread
Investment Company, which has a substantial holding in the high voting B
shares. Any such move would necessitate freeing the structure of the group's
low-voting 'A' shares.
In buying over 1,000 pubs, Whitbread would have to sell or untie a similar
amount to comply with the Beer Orders. It would also be locked into a
substantial beer supply contract with its rival Courage for which it would
have to pay compensation to exit.
However, Mr Frankis believes the deal would make good sense. 'This would be
a very logical acquisition for Whitbread and a good strategic long-term
move,' he said. Advising a hold, he added: 'But investor enthusiasm for the
enfranchisement of the shares is reflected in the current share price.'
Hotel group Forte fell sharply, although old talk of a rights issue was
dismissed by leisure analysts, who put most of the speculation down to
nervousness ahead of the results in a few weeks.
The company is expected to reveal that it plans to float off its airport
catering business next year. Forte shares closed 7 off at 230p in turnover
of 4.8m.
Institutional presentations by Granada were said to be carrying a bullish
message on current trading. The shares gained 8 to 453p.
The surprise dividend announcement by Glaxo that gave such a boost to the
share price a week ago was helping again. Glaxo goes ex at a higher than
expected 22p dividend on Monday and buying for that payout lifted the shares
8 to 644p on turnover of 11m shares. The rest of the sector was held back
ahead of the publication of the Clinton healthcare reforms next Wednesday.
Speculation that President Clinton will only adjust excise taxes marginally
when he reveals his healthcare reforms next week helped spirit stocks.
Guinness jumped 7 1/2 to 465p.
Strong two-way business in conglomerate BTR pushed turnover to 11m as the
shares hardened 2 to 375p.
Hoare Govett and Kleinwort Benson were reported to be positive on BICC
following a presentation and the shares firmed 3 to 412p.
Morgan Crucible were bought ahead of figures on Monday and the shares rose 4
to 301p.
Profit-taking in Kwik-Fit following well-received interims earlier in the
week sent the shares down 2 1/2 to 170p.
MB Caradon firmed 7 to 330p after an egm approved its acquisition of most of
the Pillar business from mining group RTZ. RTZ hardened 2 to 688p.
Among the oil exploration and production groups, Lasmo held up against a
downgrade by the US house Kidder Peabody.
The brokerage said that once all non-recurring items were stripped out,
Lasmo's first half profits were very disappointing. Kidder is now
forecasting a full-year earnings per share loss off 5p against a previous
estimate of a 5.8p gain. Lasmo shares closed a penny stronger at 135p.
Hazlewood Foods advanced following Thursday's positive agm statement. The
shares closed 7 ahead at 180p.

FT  18 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure on oil sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUMBLING oil prices prompted one US house to turn bearish on the sector
yesterday. US investors have been the principal supporters of the leading
oil shares and the move raised the spectre of a change of mind on their
part. However, dealers said US buyers were still attracted by the recovery
potential of the leading oil stocks particularly BP.
Lehman Brothers published a broad downgrade based on a two-dollar cut to
Dollars 16.75 a barrel in its estimate for the average price of Brent crude
next year.
As a result, the house slashed its BP earnings forecast for next year to
16.6p a share from 22.1p. Analyst Mr Jeremy Hudson said: 'UK and European
energy stocks are priced more highly than their US equivalents and we are
recommending that BP's fair value is about 250p.' This contrasts with a
close last night of 296 1/2 p, down 7 on the day.
The house says Shell Transport is more up with events because of the
attractive valuation of its Royal Dutch arm but it has reduced its eps
forecast by nearly 5p to 40.8p and believes a fair share price is 612p.
Lehman's gloomy forecasts are approaching the historically cautious view of
SGST which is a long-time seller of BP. Strauss published a hefty review
earlier in the week which forecasts a first-quarter oil price of Dollars
15.50 a barrel and sees BP's share price slipping to 255p. Meanwhile, agency
broker James Capel reiterated its bearish view of the sector ahead of a key
Opec meeting on September 25.
Nearly 10m shares in BP traded. Shell, which goes ex a 7.2p dividend on
Monday, was held up by yield buying and closed 2 ahead at 657p.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Schlesinger helps the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was well underpinned against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday, helped by growing indications that the level of Germany inflation
is falling, writes James Blitz.
Few dealers expect any signal of an easing in German monetary policy next
Thursday, when Mr Helmut Schlesinger chairs his last meeting of the
Bundesbank's policy making council in his role as President. 'I suspect
they'll be getting the champagne out rather than discussing monetary
policy,' said the chief economist at one leading US bank in London
yesterday.
But comments from Mr Schlesinger on Thursday raised new speculation that
German interest rates are coming down faster than the market has expected.
The outgoing Bundesbank president said that M3 monetary growth in August had
not been as strong as anticipated, following the Bundesbank's DM30bn
intervention in support of exchange rate mechanism currencies.
There is also growing anticipation of a decline in German consumer price
inflation.
Next week, the German Lander will give their inflation figures for last
month. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London,
thinks that inflation will fall to 4 per cent for the whole country in the
August figures. He also thinks that by October, inflation will have fallen
below the 4 per cent level.
The dollar closed at DM1.6095 from a previous close of DM1.6065.
There was far less activity in the dollar/yen exchange rate, in spite of
what must be US disappointment in the fiscal stimulus launched by Japan last
week.
Both Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury Secretary, and Mr Larry Summers, the
Under-Secretary for International Affairs, have both expressed satisfaction
with the package. Some currency analysts have been surprised by that tone,
and believe that they may get more critical after Japanese officials visit
Washington next week. However, the US would not want to weaken the Japanese
economy so much by allowing the yen to appreciate so strongly, and that the
possibility of intervention by the Federal Reserve still exists.
The yen closed at Y104.35 from a previous Y104.40.
In Europe, exchange rates were little moved yesterday at the end of a quiet
week. Sterling closed at DM2.4700 from a previous DM2.4625. Next week's M4
money supply data is expected to be little changed on the week. But Mr David
Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said that there could be
renewed speculation about an interest rate cut if the figure was weaker than
expected.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Money Markets: European contracts rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN interest rate contracts were a good deal stronger yesterday amid
speculation that lower inflation in Germany could bring a faster pace to
interest rate cutting, writes James Blitz.
In comments made on Thursday night, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the outgoing
Bundesbank President, suggested that the rate of growth of German M3 money
supply was slowing down. Another Bundesbank member was also quoted yesterday
as saying that German inflation could be as low as 3.5 per cent by the end
of the year.
Both of these statements had a direct impact on German interest rate
futures. But the whole of Europe has received strong underpinning from a
wide range of official moves and comments made earlier in the week.
Both Belgium and Denmark have cut their key interest rates this week. Mr
Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank governor, also made a telling remark
on Thursday, when he said that Danish rates no longer have to move in tandem
with German rates and may decouple.
Mr Adrian James, an economist with NatWest Markets, says that all these
moves should be an example to other countries, including France, that high
interest rates are not a viable way of keeping their respective currencies
strong.
The December Euromark contract rose 5 basis points to close at 94.00. The
December Pibor contract was also very strong, closing 7 basis points higher
at 93.83. However, the December Belgian franc contract was unchanged at
92.80.
In the German cash market, the cost of call money rose to about 6.95 per
cent as the month's tax deadline led to another liquidity squeeze. Traders
said that most of the DM24.4bn injected into the market by the Bundesbank
earlier in the week had been soaked up by dealers.
Sentiment about interest rate cuts continued to be strong in sterling
markets, helped by Thursday's unemployment figures. The December short
sterling contract closed 6 basis points higher at 94.33. The March contract
closed 8 basis points higher at 94.46.
In the sterling cash market, there was also a slight softening of interest
rates, helped by the swift despatch of an Pounds 800m shortage forecast by
the Bank of England at the start of trading.
The overnight rate of interest was quoted as low as 3 per cent at one stage.
Three month sterling cash was more-or-less unchanged, however, at 5 15/16
per cent on the bid side and 5 7/8 per cent offered.

third-quarter fall

<TEXT>
SHARES in Westinghouse Electric softened on Wall Street yesterday after the
diversified US group warned of a substantial downturn in third-quarter
earnings.
The stock shed Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 13 7/8 in heavy volume.
Net income from continuing operations is expected to drop 50 per cent in the
period, against last year's comparable figure of Dollars 91m, or 22 cents a
share. The consensus forecast by analysts was earnings of 24 cents a share.
For the full year, operating results were expected to slip 10 to 20 per cent
from 1992 levels.
The company, which has been struggling to recover from poor property
investments in the 1980s, blamed the downturn on the deterioration of the
market for environmental products and services, especially in Europe.
Electronics systems, power systems, and broadcasting were also experiencing
a lacklustre third quarter, it said.
In an effort to reduce its heavy debt burden, Westinghouse has been
gradually withdrawing from financial services - particularly from real
estate investment.
In August it agreed to sell its electrical distribution and control
equipment business to Eaton for Dollars 1.1bn.

FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank clarifies role at
Daimler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bank's announcement yesterday that it was planning to reduce its
stake in Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, follows months
of speculation about the bank's intentions.
A member of the bank's board hinted earlier this year that a partial sale
was being considered. However, until yesterday the bank's formal position
was that it had 'no present intention' to reduce the stake.
Deutsche, Germany's largest bank, said it was likely to sell a 3 per cent
stake in Daimler through an offering to US shareholders. At current prices,
that will raise just under DM1bn (Dollars 625m) for the bank, leaving it
with a 25 per cent stake worth some DM8bn.
The move is linked to Daimler-Benz's plans to list its shares on the New
York Stock Exchange on October 5, making it the first German company to have
a 'Big Board' listing on the world's largest capital market. Deutsche said
the sale of some of its shares would help Daimler achieve its objective of
broadening its shareholder base in the US.
The offering is unlikely to take place until early next year. Deutsche said
it would wait until shares in Mercedes Aktiengesellschaft Holding (MAH) had
been converted into ordinary Daimler shares. MAH was a holding company set
up at Deutsche's initiative in the 1970s to protect Daimler from takeover.
It serves no purpose other than to hold 25 per cent of Daimler's stock.
Earlier this year Daimler said it would disband MAH, chiefly because, for
technical reasons, it makes it expensive for Daimler to raise cash via the
equity market.
Deutsche's relationship with Daimler is one of the enduring features of
German capitalism. It dates back to the late-1920s, when Deutsche helped
advise on the merger of two automotive manufacturers to create Daimler-Benz.
Since then, the bank has maintained its influence through its shareholding
and via the supervisory board.
By tradition, the chief executive of the bank has always been chairman of
the Daimler supervisory board, a position currently occupied by Mr Hilmar
Kopper.
Deutsche's role in Daimler's affairs has been subject to criticism from
those who say the bank - bigger in profits terms than its next two German
rivals - occupies too powerful a position in German corporate life. This is
cemented by dozens of shareholdings in Germany's largest companies, and by
hundreds of positions on German supervisory boards.
Under Mr Alfred Herrhausen, the bank's chief executive who was murdered by
terrorists in 1989, Deutsche was not shy about this influence. Mr Herrhausen
used to explain Daimler's strategy in the press, and was reported to have
been instrumental in ousting Mr Werner Breitschwert from his position as
Daimler's chief executive.
Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler's current chief executive and architect of the
group's controversial diversification strategy, was Mr Herrhausen's protege.
Under Mr Hilmar Kopper, who succeeded Mr Herrhausen, the bank has played
down its powerful role in German industry. It has said that, in principle,
it wants to reduce its extensive industrial holdings as the capital could be
better invested in its mainstream banking business. However, a 3 per cent
reduction does not amount to a withdrawal from Daimler's affairs. The bank's
25 per cent stake and the role on the supervisory board will leave the
relationship much as before.
That the move is taking place does, however, show the willingness of the
German corporate and financial establishment to 'think the unthinkable' amid
the worst recession in Germany since the second world war. Daimler's listing
in New York, to which Deutsche is co-adviser with Goldman Sachs, is also
evidence of this. The listing will require Daimler to disclose significantly
more financial information than is required under German accounting rules.
It is also likely to influence the way in which the group is managed,
putting the management board under greater pressure to generate short-term
profit and pay higher dividends to performance-oriented US shareholders.

FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Saint-Gobain eyes 2% BNP holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAINT-GOBAIN, the French glass and building materials group, said yesterday
it planned to take a stake of about 2 per cent in Banque Nationale de Paris
when it is privatised.
Saint-Gobain said the move would reflect a long-standing relationship
between the two companies. BNP holds just under 4 per cent of Saint-Gobain's
shares.
Mr Marc de Nadaillac, managing director, also said he saw no signs of
recovery in the group's principal markets in the current half. He was
speaking the day after the group announced a two-thirds fall in net profits
for the first half of the year, to FFr452m (Dollars 80.7m) from FFr1.4bn.
In particular, the sale of glass to the automotive industry, Saint-Gobain's
largest business activity, is expected to remain depressed as a result of
the continued sharp decline in the European car market.
Mr de Nadaillac said the company would expand outside Europe and develop
specialty products to counteract the effects of the recession in its
principal markets. Mexico, Korea and eastern Europe were being considered.
The company also plans to trim its debt and investments in the second half
of the year. Gearing is forecast to fall to 45 per cent at the end of the
year, compared with 46 per cent at the end of 1992. Industrial investments
are targetted at FFr4.6bn this year compared with FFr5.08bn in 1992.
The French finance ministry said the pre-subscription of BNP shares would
start on Monday, and that the privatisation of the bank would take place by
December 20 at the latest, market conditions permitting.
Analysts in Paris were surprised at the late deadline.

FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Accor in talks over Air France
hotel deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOR, the French hotel and tourism group, is holding talks with Air France,
the state-owned airline, concerning a merger of its Sofitel hotels operation
with the airline's Meridien hotel chain.
Accor said it had long been interested in merging the groups to create a
strong international luxury hotel group. The plan has received impetus from
Air France's announcement this week that it wanted to sell the Meridien
hotel chain as part of a package of economy measures.
The airline announced an ambitious strategy to reduce losses and cut costs
by about FFr5bn (Dollars 893m) by the end of next year. It named several
assets, including the Meridien hotels, in which it holds a 57 per cent
stake, as candidates for disposal.
Accor stressed yesterday it did not want to buy the Meridien hotel chain.
With net debts of about FFr16bn at the end of last year, the company is
constrained in making acquisitions. Instead, it envisages a new company
pooling the Sofitel and Meridien hotels.
According to such a scheme, Air France would receive payment from other
investors in the new hotel group.
A combination of Meridien and Sofitel would create a chain of about 140
hotels.

FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: VW rethinks Skoda investment
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN'S dramatic last-minute withdrawal from its planned DM1.4bn
(Dollars 875m) financing deal for Skoda, its Czech affiliate, was forced by
the drastic reduction in the group's capital investment plans, Mr Rutbert
Reisch, VW group treasurer, said yesterday.
'It is apparent that our investment plans for Skoda will change
substantially,' he said.
Volkswagen yesterday had been due to sign the DM1.4bn Skoda project finance
facility, the biggest yet planned for east Europe, with a banking group led
by the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The four lead commercial banks were Dresdner and Deutsche banks, J. P.
Morgan, and CS First Boston.
'It was the more honest and professional thing to do - to call off the deal,
rather than have all the banks come and sign - when we know that the
investment plans in the prospectus documents will change dramatically,' said
Mr Reisch.
'It was the lesser of two evils to call off the deal at short notice.'
The treasurer himself was only informed on Thursday morning by the group's
management board that the financing deal, which had been under negotiation
for nearly two years, was to be abandoned.
Mr Reisch was unable to provide any detail of how VW now planned to proceed
with the development of Skoda, in which it is acquiring a majority 70 per
cent stake.
VW had planned to spend DM7bn over 10 years at Skoda. This would have been
to double its production capacity to more than 400,000 cars a year, to
modernise its facilities, and to renew its products with the addition of a
second car range.
With VW suffering from heavy losses and sharply declining sales, Mr Reisch
said the group's investment plans were now 'in flux'.
'The whole expenditure process is being restructured and reviewed. This is a
huge task that proceeds at an enormous pace, but it still takes time to run
through all the elements,' he said.
He did not expect the move to have a detrimental effect on VW's banking
relationships.
The surprise of London bankers at VW's withdrawal from the financing deal
was mirrored by the Czech government and Skoda itself. Skoda executives said
yesterday they had been informed the deal was off less than 24 hours before
the planned signing.
Mr Jiri Hrabovsky, Skoda spokesman, insisted the company still planned to
double production to around 450,000 cars a year by 1997.

FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: US West plans Dollars 610m
charge to cover job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US WEST, the Denver-based regional telecommunications company, yesterday
announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs - 15 per cent of its workforce. The move
is part of a modernisation programme to cope with rapidly-growing
competition in the previously monopolistic US local telephone industry.
It will take a special Dollars 610m after-tax charge against third-quarter
earnings.
US West, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bell' phone companies, said it
would also be the first local US telecommunications group to adopt a new
accounting method allowing it to depreciate its plant and equipment more
rapidly.
The accounting move, which is also a response to growing competition, will
involve a third-quarter, one-time, non-cash charge of Dollars 3.2bn after
tax.
US local telecommunications companies face escalating competition from cable
companies, long-distance carriers, and new metropolitan service carriers as
the industry gradually converges with television to provide new multi-media
inter-active services.
Although all local companies have been trimming their workforces and
modernising plant to cope with these changes, US West's move is among the
most dramatic.
The company, which serves 14 states in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific
north-west, is to consolidate operating centres in 560 communities into 26
new centres by 1995.
The 9,000 jobs, which include 1,000 already announced, will be phased out
over the next three years, mostly through lay-offs.
US West said it was 'reinventing' many of its internal operations to make
itself more responsive to customer demands. For example, customers would be
able to get a new phone service in record time.
The accounting change involves moving from Financial Accounting Standard 71,
which governs regulated industries such as local telecommunications, and
requires depreciation of plant and equipment to be set using lives approved
by regulators, which tend to be very long.
US West will now adopt in its financial reporting shorter, more market-based
depreciation lives, though this will not affect the books it keeps for
regulatory purposes or phone charges. For example, copper wire will now be
depreciated over 15 years rather than 27.

advance

A SHARP increase in earnings from its steel division helped Broken Hill
Proprietary, the Australian minerals and steel group, report a 22.1 per cent
increase in first-quarter profits after tax, to ADollars 316.1m (USDollars
206.5m).
The performance was much better than many analysts had predicted: forecasts
had generally ranged between ADollars 250m and ADollars 300m. The shares
rose on the news, closing 52 cents higher at ADollars 15.96.
Earnings per share for the quarter, to the end of August, rose 17.3 per cent
to 23.7 cents. Group sales were up 7.9 per cent at ADollars 4.15bn.
BHP attributed the figures to a much stronger performance by its steel
division, aided - in turn - by the lower exchange rate with the US dollars.
This segment turned in an operating profit of ADollars 135.8m, compared with
just ADollars 53m last time.
BHP said steel operations had benefited from lower unit costs, attributed to
a 14 per cent increase in total raw steel production, its highest quarterly
level since 1981. Australian domestic steel 'despatches' were 991,000
tonnes, a 14 per cent increase year-on-year, while export steel despatches
from Australia were 629,000 tonnes, up 28 per cent.
On the minerals side, BHP saw a small 4 per cent decline in profits, to
ADollars 152m, reflecting lower US dollar prices for copper, iron ore,
manganese and Australian and Indonesian coal.
Profits from the petroleum unit fell 2.6 per cent, to ADollars 133.6m -
again due to lower world oil prices. These were only partially offset by
higher US gas prices and the weaker exchange rate.
Profit from the service companies advanced sharply, from ADollars 5.9m to
ADollars 418.7m.

<TEXT>
A FORMER top executive of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin)
group has reportedly admitted to magistrates that the much-trumpeted 1989
sale of control of its big Fondiaria insurance subsidiary was never fully
implemented.
According to leaked evidence to Milan magistrates investigating alleged
corruption, Mr Roberto Michetti, former finance director of Ferruzzi's
Montedison subsidiary, said the transfer of a controlling stake in Fondiaria
to the quoted Gaic holding company had never been put through.
Mr Michetti allegedly said the L3,600bn (Dollars 2.3bn) sale to Gaic, then
jointly controlled by Ferfin and the financier Mr Camillo De Benedetti, had
been conducted to shift borrowings off Ferfin's debt-laden books.
However, according to Mr Michetti, one of several former Ferruzzi executives
under investigation for alleged political corruption and financial
irregularities, control was never fully transferred to Gaic.
In the leaked testimony, published in today's Panorama magazine, he claims
Mr De Benedetti, who died earlier this year, put up only L300bn of the
L1,800bn necessary to gain control of Fondiaria through Gaic, which was in
turn controlled by a holding company jointly owned by Ferfin and Mr De
Benedetti's family interests.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper plunges as squeeze
ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE COPPER squeeze is over
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that much is clear. What remains far from clear, however, is how and why it
met its end. Having survived repeated warnings from the London Metal
Exchange management and last week's LME action to limit the cash/one day
premium to Dollars 5 a tonne, the squeeze that had been distorting the
market since the summer suddenly took a turn for the worse in after hours
trading on Thursday. And by lunchtime yesterday it had breathed its last.
The cash premium over three months metal (the 'backwardation'), which a few
days before had exceeded Dollars 70 a tonne and still stood at Dollars 43.50
at the close of Thursday's afternoon ring-dealing session, collapsed to
Dollars 20 during afterhours trading and by yesterday's close had been
replaced by a Dollars 5 cash discount.
A cash discount (or 'contango') is the normal market situation when adequate
supplies are available to the market, representing the cost of holding
physical metal. But although the total of copper stocks in exchange
warehouses has been at a 15-year high for some time much of it has been
securely held by a group of operators allegedly seeking to drive up nearby
prices to their own profit. Speculators who had sold copper forward in the
expectation that they would be able to make covering purchases at cheaper
prices as bearish fundamentals depressed the market found themselves having
to pay premiums to roll their positions over, to avoid taking heavy losses.
Explanations for the sudden collapse of the squeeze are many and various.
Chinese selling has been suggested, as has backroom pressure from the
exchange authorities. Other traders believe that much of the 'long' position
was held against a planned physical deal that had now been completed.
Another, and perhaps more likely, suggestion is that the 'shorts', dismayed
by the failure of the backwardation to narrow significantly following last
week's LME action, had done a deal with the 'longs' under which they cut
their losses and the latter cut their profits.
The actual explanation may or may not become clear in the fullness of time,
but traders are now more interested in watching the behaviour of the
unsupported market. The three months position, which closed yesterday at
Dollars 1,764.50 a tonne, has already fallen by more than Dollars 180 from
the peak reached two weeks ago and many analysts believe the sell-off is far
from over.
Compared to copper the nickel market is a model of simplicity. LME stocks
are at a record and growing; producers are still stubbornly refusing to make
the production cuts necessary to get supply into balance with demand; and
no-one has felt tempted to try to prop up prices. The result has been the
long downtrend that this week took the LME three-months price below the
equivalent of Dollars 2 a lb, the level some analysts have suggested will
force some producers to bite the bullet at last.
At the London Commodity Exchange cocoa moved out of coffee's shadow and into
the limelight this week as nearby futures positions stormed to levels last
seen in the summer of 1990.
A move towards the psychological barrier at Pounds 900 a tonne for December
delivery faltered on Tuesday, but the bulls - encouraged by a deepening
conviction that world stocks were set to fall heavily - were not to be
denied. After edging the price up again on Wednesday they went on the
rampage the following day, pushing the December contract to Pounds 909 a
tonne at one stage. Early trading yesterday saw the price at Pounds 907, but
it was pared back by profit-taking to close at Pounds 903 a tonne, up Pounds
47 on the week and Pounds 124 over the past month.
Traders were undaunted by yesterday's modest retracement, arguing that a
period of consolidation was 'hardly surprising' after such a strong
performance. They saw supply/demand prospects for cocoa as fundamentally
bullish and thought further gains were likely. 'We had been forecasting that
the December price would reach Pounds 1,000 by the end of the year,' said Mr
Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at London trade house GNI. 'Now it
looks as though it could make that by the end of the month.'
It will not be all plain sailing, however. Mr Eagles noted that there were
technical hurdles to be cleared at Pounds 958 a tonne, the life-of-contract
high for the December contract, and Pounds 967, the long-time high for the
second position (reached on May 24, 1990), before stiff psychological
resistance was met at Pounds 1,000 a tonne.
Mr Eagles said earlier in the week that the market's new-found confidence
was based on expectations of a third production deficit this year, resulting
in a stocks drawdown of between 200,00 and 300,000 tonnes, to which could be
added 179,000 of the 230,00 tonnes in the International Cocoa Organisation's
buffer stock. He explained that the agreement by producer and consumer
members of the organisation to dispose of the stockpile in an orderly
fashion over not more than four and a half years, to which finishing were
being put in London yesterday afternoon, transformed the 179,000 tonnes that
would remain after this season's disposals from an overhanging stock into a
predictable, medium-term source of supply.
The effective level of world stocks was therefore likely to fall by between
379,000 and 479,000 tonnes from the present level of about 1.2m tonnes.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Magnolia looks abroad for growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Magnolia Group, the picture frame and reproductions company, raised pre-tax
profits from Pounds 52,000 to Pounds 76,000 in the first half of 1993.
Turnover fell from Pounds 9.47m to Pounds 9.05m.
The company said the UK remained quiet but exports showed an improvement of
150 per cent. The result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds
93,000 (Pounds 108,000). Gearing at the period end was 18 per cent.
Earnings per share were 0.92p (0.61p). The interim dividend is again being
passed.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CSI back in black at interim stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANNON Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate with interests in hotels
and leisure, electronics distribution and food and drink distribution,
returned to profits at the interim stage, helped by profits on the sale of
businesses and lower interest costs.
The group, which has been restructured by a new management team, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.83m in the 28 weeks to July 17 compared with
restated pre-tax losses of Pounds 30m in the 26 weeks to June 30 last year.
Underlying the turnround, CSI posted trading profits from continuing
activities of Pounds 2.12m (Pounds 6.73m losses) on turnover of Pounds 96.7m
(Pounds 80.2m). Discontinued activities added Pounds 204,000 (Pounds
770,000) to trading profits and Pounds 2.91m (Pounds 46.85m) to turnover.
Profits were further boosted in the latest period by Pounds 4.32m profits on
the sale and termination of operations mainly related to the sale of the
Dutch Tamson business and the Georgian House Hotel - last time the group
recorded a Pounds 19.9m loss on the sale and closure of businesses.
Interest costs also fell sharply to Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 4.06m), reflecting
lower interest rates and a further reduction in net bank borrowings which
fell to Pounds 13.4m compared with Pounds 29.6m.
Mr Tom Long, chairman, said the turnround in operating profits was the
result of 'steps taken to bring greater management focus to the group'.
Among the three core businesses Mr Long said the electronics distribution
operations performed well, the leisure division had 'mixed fortunes', while
the food and drink operations achieved good results.
Mr David Smith, chief executive, said only two businesses, both linked to
the construction sector, failed to post profits in the first half.
Generally, he said, 'things are coming along steadily.'
The group reported earnings per share of 3.14p (losses 30.01p). However,
there is no interim dividend because earlier losses resulted in a deficit in
distributable reserves.
Now that the group has returned to profitability Mr Smith said the board is
considering a capital reorganisation which would allow the group to resume
dividend payments at some stage.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Proudfoot halved at Pounds 5.6m - Shares
fall sharply and interim dividend cut by two-thirds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Alexander Proudfoot, the troubled management consultancy group
chaired by Lord Stevens of Ludgate, dropped 51p to 76p yesterday, as it
announced halved first half 1993 profits and a big cut in the interim
dividend.
Pre-tax profits from continuing operations tumbled from Pounds 13.2m to
Pounds 5.6m, and the group warned that it would 'do well to match the
first-half pre-tax profit in the second half'.
Under FSR 3 accounting rules, there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.6m
(Pounds 12m profit) after taking a loss from discontinued operations of
Pounds 19.1m. This relates to the closure in April of its Indevo operations
in Sweden and Norway and represents a goodwill provision of Pounds 15.1m,
plus trading losses of Pounds 1.4m and closure cost provisions of Pounds
2.6m.
Mr David Gill, finance director since May, said that the recession in Europe
and tough trading conditions worldwide for consultancy businesses had hit
turnover and profits.
Turnover from continuing operations fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 79.4m
(Pounds 87.1m).
Philip Crosby, the managment consultancy which is predominantly US-based,
accounted for Pounds 3.6m of the Pounds 7.7m decline in turnover. This
translated into a Pounds 7.6m decline in profits from continuing operations
because of high fixed costs and the strength of the dollar.
Mr Gill said the reaction had been a cost reduction programme on people,
facilities and telecommunications which would lead to annualised savings of
Pounds 15m. The interim results included Pounds 700,000 of costs related to
the programme, and a further Pounds 800,000 would follow in the second half.
At the end of the first half the group had net cash and investments of
Pounds 9m. However, this had fallen to Pounds 4.6m as a result of the 1992
dividend payment and difficult summer trading conditions in Europe.
Adjusted earnings per share were 5.2p, down from 22.8p. The loss per share
after taking in the loss from discontinued operations was 26.3p.
The interim dividend has been cut from 6p to 2p a share. This represented
about 40 per cent of earnings per share from continuing operations - a
formula which it would follow in future.
A scrip dividend alternative will be offered.
COMMENT
The best that can be said of Proudfoot is that at long last it appears to be
taking some of the necessary action for recovery. The new management's
decision to cut the dividend sharply is sensible house-keeping. However, the
cost savings of Pounds 15m a year appear to have been achieved remarkably
cheaply for a people-based business. This could transform the business but
nothing dramatic is likely to happen this year as recession grips
continental Europe. Full-year profits of Pounds 8.5m give a p/e of 9,
reflecting uncertainty.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: IIMR gives definition of 'headline'
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE of Investment Management and Research has announced the final
definition of the 'headline' earnings calculation it will use in response to
changes in accounting standards.
The figure will include all trading profits and losses for the company for
the year, including interest and abnormal trading items, and those from
operations discontinued during the year.
Profits or losses on the sale or termination of a discontinued operation and
on the sale of fixed assets or of businesses should be excluded.
The adoption of the formula follows the introduction of FRS 3, the new
financial reporting standard on the profit and loss account, which is now
mandatory for British companies.
There has been one change since the Institute's draft proposals for a
headline figure announced in March this year.
Provisions for writing down fixed assets where there has been a permanent
diminution in value are excluded from the calculation.
So are profits and losses on the sale of fixed assets or complete
write-offs.
The Financial Times will be adopting the IIMR proposals for its calculation
of price/earnings ratios. Extel Financial will also be using the figure as
its principal earnings number.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Parambe hit by lower art income
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Parambe, which deals in securities and works of art, suffered a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 68,642 to Pounds 40,238 in the first half of
1993.
The result reflected a sharp fall in income from works of art, where Ashlar,
the art dealing offshoot, was unable to replace profits earned in 1991 from
the sales of old master drawings to an American museum. Current sales were
still 'disappointingly slow.'
Net asset value per share rose by 18 per cent to 71.6p in the period, mainly
due to a 33 per cent rise in the value of the investment portfolio.
Security dealing income grew from Pounds 4,140 to Pounds 47,240, while the
art contribution fell to Pounds 18,263 (Pounds 107,627). Investment income
was little changed at Pounds 41,289 (Pounds 40,852).
Earnings per share declined to 0.49p (0.83p), but the interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.55p.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Golden Vale sees turnover of IPounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Golden Vale, the County Cork-based dairy products company, reported pre-tax
profits of IPounds 9.14m (Pounds 8.64m) for the six months to June 30,
against IPounds 7.75m.
Turnover advanced from IPounds 155.8m to IPounds 184.5m reflecting the
inclusion of Dairy Produce Packers for the first time. The figures do not
include three large purchases announced in the period, Leckpatrick, 33 per
cent of A/S Vejle Margarinefabrik in Denmark and the ongoing acquisition of
Vonk in the Netherlands and Poland.
The company said that by next year it expected turnover to be about IPounds
500m.
In the first half there were increases in volumes in dairy spreads,
processed cheese and industrial sales whereas sales of primary products
continued to decline as a result of the company's ongoing strategy.
Net interest payable fell to IPounds 890,000 (IPounds 956,000). The company
said there was a significant reduction in interest on core borrowings but
this was offset by the inclusion of DPP borrowings.
Earnings per share were 4.66p (4.35p). The interim dividend is raised to
0.6p (0.5p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Wood &amp; Son (Longport), maker of earthenware, beakers and terracotta
teapots, turned round from a loss of Pounds 42,724 to a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 16,402 in the first half of 1993.
With turnover down 2 per cent at Pounds 1.53m, Mr Anthony Wood, chairman,
said the 'modest' result reflected the effects of a cost reduction drive.
The company experienced exceptionally bad trading conditions during the
period, but there had been a recent improvement thanks to a 41 per cent rise
in exports and a pick-up in orders from the home market.
First-half earnings per share were 0.55p (1.69p losses).

Pre-tax profits of Macallan-Glenlivet, the whisky distiller, fell from
Pounds 2.84m to Pounds 2.16m in the half year to the end of June. Turnover
fell to Pounds 6.49m, compared with Pounds 6.93m.
The company blamed weak demand for new fillings and lower interest rates
which cut net interest income from Pounds 474,000 to Pounds 279,000.
It added that full year results were expected to reflect the trend of the

Earnings per share were 1.37p (1.77p) but in view of longer term prospects
and the board's confidence the interim dividend is being raised from 0.3p to

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Losses at Ramus lead to new chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INADEQUATE management control was one of the reasons given for an increase
in annual pre-tax losses at Ramus Holdings, the USM-quoted building
materials supplier. Other reasons were poor trading conditions and the delay
in selling a freehold property.
Mr KC Wong has been appointed chief executive and will be supported by a
finance director from outside the group. Mr John Ramus, the managing
director has left the company immediately.
The shares closed down 5p at 18p. The ultimate holding company is Hong Leong
Group, the principle subsidiaries of which are registered in Malaysia.
On turnover of Pounds 41.5m (Pounds 52.9m) the pre-tax loss increased from
Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 4.22m. Exceptional costs of Pounds 677,000 covered
closure and rationalisation costs, stock write downs and provisions on a
property sale.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tobacco machinery boost takes Molins to
Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOLINS, the precision engineering group, lifted pre-tax profits for the
first half of 1993 by 14 per cent on the back of good sales of new tobacco
machinery.
The surplus reached Pounds 8m, compared with a restated Pounds 7m
previously. Turnover was ahead 16 per cent at Pounds 85.2m, compared with
Pounds 73.5m last time.
Mr Michael Orr, chairman, said that while margins were under pressure in the
two main divisions, order books were satisfactory, and the company was
better placed now than at this time last year.
The tobacco machinery's original equipment side had benefited from strong
Chinese demand and increased efficiency. In addition, there had been a
modest benefit from sterling's devaluation.
However, on the service side, while margins had been maintained, volumes had
fallen because of the cigarette price war in the US and lower demand from
Brazil. The latest figure includes a net pension credit of Pounds 1.8m.
Operating profits in the tobacco machinery division were Pounds 8.4m (Pounds
8m) on turnover of Pounds 52.2m (Pounds 48m).
Total operating profits were Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 8.5m), including a net
pension credit of Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.7m).
Earlier this month the group received Pounds 11.8m after tax from a surplus
in the pension scheme, which will be used to reduce borrowings.
The group said the repayment would have no material effect on earnings in
the second half.
The packaging machinery business, which is based mainly in North America,
reported operating profits down to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 700,000) on
turnover 33 per cent up at Pounds 32.6m from a previous Pounds 24.4m.
Net borrowings fell to Pounds 18.4m at the end of the period compared with a
previous Pounds 24.4m, giving gearing of 12.6 per cent against 18.5 per
cent.
Earnings per share rose from 17.4p to 20.1p . The interim dividend is
increased to 4.9p (4.5p).

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hornby hit by video games invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVASION of the high street by video games and just-in-time stocking by
retailers left Hornby, the hobby and sports boat manufacturer, with
first-half 1993 pre-tax losses of Pounds 791,000 compared with profits of
Pounds 158,000.
Mr Malcolm Thomas, the new chairman, said the downturn was also due to the
weakness of sterling increasing import costs. Sales of video games continued
to take cash away from traditional toys and retailers had continued to place
orders for immediate needs only.
But the company is confident about the full year. Mr Thomas said the current
order position was satisfactory and the value of orders received so far
represented a similar percentage of total planned sales compared with the
corresponding time last year.
He said the new Gladiator range, based on the television series, had
achieved wide distribution and was well received by customers.
Turnover fell to Pounds 8.12m (Pounds 11.5m). Mr Thomas said a change in the
time of new product releases and the later pattern of customer ordering had
accentuated the seasonal profile of sales, which are usually biased towards
the second half.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 16,000 (Pounds 58,000). Cash flow was
stronger, resulting from a lower volume of imports, tight controls on
capital expenditure, and lower base rates in the period. Net borrowings were
Pounds 2m (Pounds 5.7m).
Losses per share were 5.9p compared with profits of 1.2p last time. Hornby
does not declare an interim dividend.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Welsh Industrial net assets rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a year of transition, Welsh Industrial Investment Trust raised net asset
value by 12 per cent to 156p at April 5 1993, against 139p a year earlier.
As expected, pre-tax profits for the year were lower at Pounds 111,123
(Pounds 140,880). This mainly reflected the trust's policy of switching
progressively out of gilts and deposits into equities. Interest received was
also reduced at Pounds 23,858 (Pounds 52,859).
Earnings per share dropped to 6.13p (7.56p), while the dividend has been cut
to 4p (4.7p).

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Venables denies Spurs' share deal
allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARK Stephens, a solicitor acting for Mr Terry Venables, Tottenham
Hotspur's dismissed chief executive, yesterday fiercely denied allegations
made about his client's financial dealings with the football club.
Mr Venables, who was dismissed by Mr Alan Sugar, Tottenham's chairman,
during the summer, was accused in a special BBC television Panorama
programme on Thursday evening of unlawfully raising Pounds 1m for the share
deal he did with Mr Sugar when they took over the club.
The programme also alleged that an unwarranted Pounds 200,000 fee arising
from the sale of Paul Gascoigne, the England footballer, to Lazio, the
Italian football club, was given to an associate of Mr Venables.
Mr Stephens said the allegations were 'flagrantly untrue, partial and
partisan', and he added that his client was considering 'a whole range of
options' in response.
He claimed the allegations were based on stolen draft documents and working
papers 'misappropriated from his (Mr Venables') accountant' which Mr
Venables never saw and gave only a 'partial picture'.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Geevor announcement delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'TECHNICAL hitch' delayed yesterday's planned announcement of a rescue for
Geevor, Britain's oldest mining company - a move which could provide
employment for hundreds of miners made redundant by the government's pit
closures programme.
The official announcement, now expected on Monday, is expected to spell out
the structure of the deal under which Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial
director of British Coal, will become chairman of Geevor.
Mr Edwards said: 'It's just the sheer weight of work of putting together a
whole series of different bits and pieces. The problem is that you suddenly
find one contract in certain respects cancels out other obligations and the
whole thing doesn't fit together. It's been sorted.'
The deal involves a rights issue, the acquisition of a Welsh pit formerly
mined by British Coal and the conversion of Geevor's debt into equity.
Geevor will acquire one of Mr Edward's private businesses, Coal Investments,
which has made bids to take over five pits closed by British Coal - Betws in
Wales, Trentham in Staffordshire, Markham Main and Rossingham in Yorkshire
and Coventry.
The new business may be able to provide work for several hundred miners.

FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Recovery plans are based upon a store of
loyalty - The efforts of Upton &amp; Southern to return to its retailing roots
and profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIXTY YEARS OLD and now the newest store in town, trumpets the advertisement
for Uptons department store in Redcar, which reopens its doors today after
refurbishment.
Uptons' canny shoppers will find the keenly-priced offers they expect. They
may also notice a few things are missing, like the drips of rain which used
to seep through the store's roof.
Customers at the three Teesside department stores of Upton &amp; Southern
Holdings have proved loyal through bad times. Last year the company reached
near-bankruptcy with debts to the Bank of Scotland of Pounds 5.9m and a net
asset deficiency of more than Pounds 1.7m.
It was rescued by financial restructuring and management changes approved in
January. These brought in Mr Jim Hodkinson, international development
director at Kingfisher and past B&amp;Q deputy chairman and chief executive, and
Mr Jeffrey Gould, a founder and later managing director of John Kent, who
has nearly 30 years retail experience.
The challenge now for Mr Hodkinson, non-executive chairman, and Mr Gould,
chief executive, is to retain customer loyalty while raising margins,
sharpening buying policies and wooing younger shoppers.
'We have a very solid client base, I'm very conscious of not losing what
we've got,' says Mr Gould.
The restructuring raised Pounds 1m in new equity. Mr Hodkinson and Mr Gould
each put in Pounds 25,000. Debt was tackled by the sale for Pounds 3m and
leaseback of Uptons main retail properties, the issue to the Bank of
Scotland of 750,000 convertible Pounds 1 preference shares for Pounds 1.5m,
and the granting of a five-year secured Pounds 800,000 loan.
First priority was refocusing the business on its department stores in
Middlesbrough, which is also its headquarters, Redcar and Stockton-on-Tees
and extricating it from the loss-making property and other interests which
stemmed from the 1986 merger of Uptons, a family business founded in 1869,
and Southern and City Properties.
'The rationale at the time was that we had assets and not much profit and
they had profit and not many assets. That came unstuck in a very big way,'
says Mr John Upton, great grandson of Uptons founder and now managing
director of the group's retail subsidiary, E Upton and Sons.
Some property interests in the portfolio, which is spread nationally, have
been sold this year. The rest will go when the time is right.
The group's stake in a satellite tracking company is being disposed of, its
shipbuilding investment has gone. Its Rotherham store and warehouse have
been closed, the Teesside warehousing reorganised and six TV and audio
shops, a 1980s acquisition, rationalised.
The Teesside department stores' main customers are families of manual
workers who are in employment and enjoy spending money while keeping a keen
eye on prices. 'We aren't a discount operation, we're a value operation,'
says Mr Gould. His new slogan is 'Uptons, always a better deal'.
He and Mr Hodkinson are impressed by Teessiders' propensity to spend,
despite high unemployment. 'It's a much tougher environment, but there's a
lot of money up here,' says Mr Hodkinson.
Even in Upton &amp; Southern's darkest days the stores showed a trading profit.
Yet they too had suffered from lost focus. 'Because sales were very
difficult to achieve they bought with a scatter gun,' says Mr Hodkinson.
They were also overstocked. In February 1992 stock at cost totalled Pounds
1.85m. It is now Pounds 970,000.
Mr Gould's target gross profit margin is 38 per cent, against 29.76 before
his arrival. The stores are currently on 36 per cent.
The product range is being nudged slightly upmarket, while keeping value as
the prime objective. Mr Gould has initiated strong buying and financial
controls, sourcing direct from manufacturers where possible to hold down
prices.
'I've been very nervous not to create a perception that prices are going
up,' he admits.
Under-investment had left the stores looking shabby; the Redcar refit for a
frugal Pounds 150,000 will be followed by Stockton and Middlesbrough next
year.
'It's very much down to the detail in this business,' says Mr Hodkinson.
After Kingfisher board meetings where the talk is in millions of pounds, he
finds it salutary to get back to basics at Uptons.
'Jeffrey would be saying, this is going to cost us Pounds 467.50. In a big
company you don't look at that detail enough.'
Upton &amp; Southern's turnover in 1993-4 will be below Pounds 10m (Pounds
10.64m) because of shop closures but a return to profit is expected. The
1992-3 pre-tax loss was Pounds 635,426.
While there is still some way to go, says Mr Gould, the company has been
'substantially turned around'.
He and Mr Hodkinson are now seeking retail acquisitions for Uptons in the
Midlands or North of England. But this time, they insist, expansion must
strengthen Uptons focus, not dilute it.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Benefits for DRG Group pensioners not
poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From W B LOVETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'How does your pension rate?' (September 11/12) is based
on a questionable survey by Bryn Davies. It appears to be the result of an
analysis of the 101 leading pension schemes (only 1 per cent of all UK
schemes). It is at best misleading, using only a few criteria and ignoring
often crucial discretionary benefits like pension increases.
DRG was a fairly large plc which was taken over and broken up in 1989 and no
longer exists. The DRG Pension Fund retains only a small number of employed
members but mainly consists of a large number of pensioners and deferred
pensioners. It has no relevance in such a survey. Mr Davis knew of this so
it is most surprising that DRG is included.
In any event, the DRG Fund provided good benefits that compared favourably
with similar companies and workforce. One feature not fully valued in the
'analysis' is that immediate unreduced pensions are provided for members
made redundant after age 50. This has been particularly welcome during the
high number of redundancies in past years. In broad terms, it doubles the
value of the benefits for a member at age 50. To state that DRG 'offers
their employees among the poorest pensions packages in the country' is
untrue.
This, though, is history. The relevant feature for members is that we
secured all the large surplus at the time of the takeover for their
benefits. For our pensioners this means that increases to their pensions
will now be greater - another feature overlooked in the analysis.
The article has already caused members to be concerned at the security of
benefits which is totally unwarranted. We are dealing with a number of
inquiries from them and as a result administration costs payable by the fund
will increase. W B Lovett,
secretary,
DRG Pension Trust,
26 Baldwin Street,

FT  18 SEP 93 / Poor asset managers: Poland's mainstream party has not
exploited the prime minister's popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grubbing for votes is what election campaigns are all about. But this basic
rule seems to have been forgotten by many of the Polish politicians with
roots in the former anti-communist Solidarity movement, who face defeat in
tomorrow's general elections.
Unable to agree on pre-electoral alliances which would have guaranteed them
a place in the new parliament, the smaller ex-Solidarity factions have spent
more energy squabbling among themselves than trying to persuade a confused
and sometimes exasperated electorate to vote for them.
The main gainers have been left-wing parties with roots in the communist
past and a history of disciplined voting. They have promised to continue the
market reforms which have brought the first taste of prosperity to many
Poles, but with a human touch which would ease the pain of change.
Yet the prospects of an electoral victory for parties with their roots in
the old regime has been greeted with calm bordering on indifference. The
zloty, the Polish currency, even gained marginally against the dollar
yesterday on the foreign exchange markets, and there has been no sign of
panic among investors, who have pushed shares on Warsaw's budding stock
exchange to record heights in recent weeks.
The collapse of the Soviet empire, symbolised by today's withdrawal of the
last Russian soldier from Polish soil, coupled with a broad consensus on the
continuation of market reforms and parliamentary democracy, seem to have
taken the heat out of Poland's political life. Solidarity leaders are no
longer heroes, but the former communists are no longer devils either.
The Democratic Union (UD), the mainstream successor to Solidarity, has
suffered most from highly pesonalised attacks against party leaders and
against President Lech Walesa by breakaway Solidarity faction leaders like
Mr Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who accuse President Walesa of becoming a communist
tool.
But Mr Walesa also increased the disarray in Solidarity ranks himself when
he first encouraged the formation of a new political grouping, the so-called
Non-Party Movement for Reform (BBWR), and then distance himself from it as
the movement lost support.
The president's steadily declining prestige suffered another blow after he
castigated a former communist secret policeman, who acted as a double agent
for the Solidarity underground in the Baltic port city of Gdansk, as a
traitor. Mr Walesa's critics claim that the only crime of Mr Adam Hodysz,
the policeman, was to fail to destroy evidence of Mr Walesa's alleged
involvement with the secret police in the early 1970s.
It is not just a question of personalities. The Poles are also suffering
from electoral weariness. They have voted in more elections over the past
four years than any other post-communist electorate. Sunday's nationwide
poll will be the fifth since the semi-free elections of June 1989 when the
then Solidarity alliance of workers and intellectuals, backed by the
powerful Catholic church, won the moral victory which led to the domino-like
collapse of communist rule throughout the region.
But after four coalition governments in as many years the Solidarity parties
are looking tired and are suffering from the inevitable dissipation of the
once euphoric hopes invested in them when communism collapsed. The Catholic
church, meanwhile, has driven many into left-wing groups like the Union of
Labour (UP) by its steamroller tactics over abortion, religious instruction
in state schools and its insistence on the return of church property.
Even so, the mainstream Democratic Union could have made a much greater
impact on the electorate had it decided to make better use of its best
political asset, the popularity of Mrs Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing prime
minister. The elegant, no-nonsense lawyer from western Poland was plucked
from relative obscurity in July last year and managed to pick up the pieces
left behind by the ineffectual right-wing government led by Mr Jan
Olszewski, a former Solidarity lawyer.
She quietly established a clear set of priorities for the new government and
managed to keep together the extraordinary coalition of seven parties
ranging from free-market liberals to protectionist peasant farmers and
Catholic traditionalists.
The government was eventually toppled by one vote at the end of May by the
trade union wing of Solidarity, whose demands for higher pay for teachers
and other public service workers would have overburdened the budget and put
at risk Poland's close relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
The defeat was unexpected and unwanted. The Liberal and UD ministers at the
core of the government had managed to keep government spending under control
and were presiding over an economic recovery which could have transformed
the government's chances of re-election in a year or so. Once the government
fell, however, it would have been logical for the UD's campaign managers to
send Mrs Suchocka around the country, tirelessly trawling for votes as the
symbol of good governance. It did not happen.
Mrs Suchocka's good-natured face graces a thousand billboards around the
country but her electoral appearances have been few and she has spent most
of her time in Warsaw quietly and competently running the caretaker
government.
This may have been good for Poland. But without her the UD has run a
defensive, lacklustre campaign, fending off attacks from right and left but
unable to counter the rising self-confidence of the former communist, now
avowedly social democratic, left.
As Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Poland's last communist prime minister, summed up
yesterday: 'The left has not won this election campaign, the Solidarity
parties have lost it.'
But there was no triumphalism in his voice. The new rules, under which
parties which win less than 5 per cent of the vote fail to enter the new
parliament, plus the likelihood that nearly half the electorate will not
turn out to vote, raise a worrying possibility.
Monday morning could see a new parliament heavily tilted towards the left
but excluding many smaller parties including the Liberal free-market and
right-wing nationalist parties. That could shift the focus of Polish
politics out of parliament and on to the streets once more. For it would
create a 'silent majority' of those not represented in parliament who could
be tempted to declare open season on whatever centre-left or left-of-centre
coalition emerges from the political horsetrading that will start once the
results are known.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Lights, camera - reaction]: France's film industry fears a
loss of identity if culture is included in Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We cannot allow the Americans to treat us as they did the Redskins,' Mr
Bertrand Tavernier told the European parliament this week. He and other
French film directors fear that, if the cinema is included in the Gatt trade
negotiations, Hollywood will either kill off their livelihood or force them
on to some ever-shrinking cultural reservation.
So, a kind of Stars War has broken out between the US and France, already at
Gatt loggerheads over agriculture. Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture
minister, said this week that his government 'will not sign' a Gatt deal
that covers, however marginally, the audiovisual industry.
The threat of a French veto is nothing like as real over the cinema as over
farm trade. But the Gatt negotiations enter the home straight just as France
is bracing itself for what its culturally prickly establishment sees as
another wave of American celluloid imperialism. Yesterday Ted Turner's new
TNT/cartoon satellite channel started beaming across Europe, and Steven
Spielberg's Jurassic Park is about to hit French cinemas next month.
Gerard Depardieu, the thinking woman's truck-driver, and star of the French
cinema, joined Mr Tavernier and many other actors, producers and directors
in Strasbourg this week to lobby MEPs. He stoutly denies that, by taking up
cudgels against the US in Gatt, suspect he is being 'anti-American'. He
himself has appeared in US films, and has indeed helped distribute some in
Europe.
But he also recognises that Hollywood is 'a war machine, a state within a
state', which has captured nearly 60 per cent of the French market, holds an
average share of 80 per cent in Europe, and is voracious for more. Depardieu
says France's cinema constitutes 'our identity', which others claim he
incarnates personally.
'Gerard Depardieu is as much a symbol for the French as John Wayne was for
Americans,' says Mr Rene Cleitman, head of Hachette Premiere, which produced
the highly successfully Cyrano de Bergerac with Depardieu in the star role.
Films have a wider role in conveying a whole lifestyle, says Mr Nicolas
Seydoux, head of the Gaumont cinema chain, pointing out that, 'without
Westerns, blue jeans would not have invaded the whole world'.
Just as in France's other international dramas over currencies and farming,
the 'Anglo-Saxons' - a term more widely used in France than anywhere else -
are cast as the villains, with the British always wearing some of the 'black
hats'. Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner who is chief Gatt
negotiator in Brussels, is seen as the man who, wittingly or not, is about
to sell the French cinema down the river.
In fact, the quarrel arises out of a difference over tactics, not aims. Sir
Leon stresses that Hollywood should not, and will not, be allowed to
steamroller Europe's cultural identity. But his US opposite number, Mr
Mickey Kantor, who happens to hail from the tinsel town of Los Angeles, has
insisted that the audiovisual sector counts as a service for inclusion in
the Gatt.
Since Brussels is keen that no services should be allowed to escape the Gatt
 -precisely because Washington has tried to keep some financial, transport
and telecommunications services out of the Gatt - Sir Leon is suggesting
including the audiovisual dossier in the Gatt, but safeguarding it with a
clause declaring its 'specificity'. He believes that this would give
Europe's audiovisual industry protection against any unilateral US action.
France's government and film industry believe this to be a fundamental
miscalculation, and urge that Europe should make the audiovisual industry a
formal 'exception' to the Gatt (as Canada did with its film industry in its
free trade deal with the US). The threat of American bullying, outside Gatt,
is phoney, says Mr Dominique Wallon, head of France's powerful Centre
National de la Cinematographie. 'What could the Americans retaliate against,
when we have only 1 per cent of their market?' he queries.
Worse, 'putting the very complex French system of film support under the
Gatt would at best freeze it, preventing its further development, and at
worst lead over time to its dismantling, piece by piece', Mr Wallon fears.
'Very complex' is indeed an understatement about a system which helps French
film-makers at every step:
Some FFr1.6bn (Pounds 182m) a year is raised, from levies of 5.5 per cent on
TV stations' turnover, 11 per cent on cinema tickets and 2 per cent on video
distributors' turnover, to back new films.
FFr600m a year in public money goes to help script-writers, to copy films,
renovate cinemas and even promote cinema studies in the classroom.
French programmes must fill no less than 40 per cent of TV stations' prime
airtime, and EC-made programmes at least 60 per cent. They also have to
'pre-buy' a certain number of French films a year.
For their part, radio stations have a French content requirement of 15-65
per cent. Hardest to meet, says Mr Andrew Manderstam, head of the RFM radio
rock station, is a requirement to play records by relatively unknown
'nouveaux talents' twice an hour.
So, in a sense, France has already put its film industry on an Indian
reservation against further encroachment from Hollywood's cavalry. Yet this
self-protectionism does not appear to have dulled the creativity of French
cinema, which - with the decline of its Italian and UK counterparts - is
Europe's largest and most successful. The evidence is that French filmgoers
want to go on having the best of both worlds (their own and America's),
rather than end up with the worst as well as the best of one Americanised
world.

FT  18 SEP 93 / First building block wedged in place: Prospects for UK
commercial property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, this week celebrated the
beginning of the end of his 35-year struggle to build 'an outstanding
example of modern architecture' at One Poultry, in the heart of the City of
London.
Soon after claiming victory in his long-running battle with the planning
authorities, he overcame another important obstacle. He secured sufficient
funds for his project by going into partnership with Mr Dieter Bock, the
German entrepreneur who is joint managing director of Lonrho.
Lord Palumbo is convinced that his building will have a place in history.
The scheme, the only London office designed by the late Sir James Stirling,
is already notorious for the skirmish it has provoked between
traditionalists and modernists.
Conservationists bitterly opposed to the proposed demolition of the existing
buildings - fine examples of Victorian commercial architecture - and loathe
the so-called masterpiece that is due to replace them. Prince Charles
described an early modernist design for the site by Mies van der Rohe as a
'glass stump' and the design by Sir James as a '1930s wireless'.
Lord Palumbo now believes that his uncompromising stand will be vindicated.
'The buildings for which we have the greatest affection today received the
greatest hostility at their time of construction,' he says. 'Architecture is
an emotional art form. The great validator is time.'
Although the debate over One Poultry has focused on rival architectural
visions, there may be a wider significance to the announcement that goes
beyond arguments over heritage and the future face of the City.
Lord Palumbo's success in arranging funding, details of which Mr Bock has
kept to himself, suggests that sceptics who regard conditions in the London
office market as too depressed to justify such an extravagant new building,
were over pessimistic. 'This partnership (with Mr Bock) is an indication
that the recession has turned a corner,' says Lord Palumbo.
However, it might be wrong to read too much into this for the wider property
development market in the City. One Poultry is, in many ways, a special
case. Though relatively small, it occupies one of the best positions in the
City. And Lord Palumbo's desire to build the development is as much the
fulfilment of a lifetime's obsession as a hard-headed commercial venture.
There is little other evidence that the property development market has
turned the corner. Only 6.2m sq ft of offices are currently being built in
the UK's cities, compared with the 15m sq ft completed in the peak year of
1991, according to Chesterton, chartered surveyors. More than 72m sq ft of
office space remains in the planning pipeline.
The development boom of the late 1980s and the severe recession of the last
three years have left deep scars. More than 15 per cent of offices in the
UK's city centres are empty. Rents are still falling, except in parts of the
retailing sector, and demand for new space from tenants remains feeble.
But the gloomy outlook for developers contrasts starkly with the buoyancy of
another sector of the property market: investment in buildings that are
already generating income.
The investment market has been transformed in recent months. Property
values, which fell by an average of 42 per cent between November 1992 and
May this year, have begun to recover.
This recovery has resulted in large part from sterling's traumatic exit from
the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago, which some in the property
industry believe saved the market from collapse. High interest rates were
triggering defaults by tenants and putting pressure on companies' balance
sheets, forcing them to sell property.
Once interest rates came down from 10 per cent to 6 per cent, the tensions
eased and the cycle of decline went into reverse. Buying commercial property
to rent out was no longer seen as a recklessly risky investment; a cool
appraisal of its prospects demonstrated that it had considerable attractions
to investors.
Property prices had tumbled to a level where yields - the ratio of annual
income to capital value - were significantly higher than on gilt edged
securities. As a result, property appeared to offer an each-way bet: a
combination of a high, secure income together with growth potential.
Some now believe the opportunities are exceptional. Richard Ellis, the
surveying firm, is predicting that returns on investments in office
buildings will reach 25 per cent by the middle of next year.
The investment market is seeing a spending surge resembling the one that
reached giddy heights in the mid-1970s and the mid and late 1980s. After
years of minimal investment in property, financial institutions have
earmarked more than Pounds 7bn for property investment over the next 12 to
18 months, according to recent surveys.
The sudden rise in interest from institutions has even raised fears that
parts of the market are overheating. Fund managers report a scramble to
invest in the sector, creating a shortage of suitable properties.
Mr Matthew Oakeshott of Olim, the fund mangers, points to the 'white hot'
market for retail warehouses. 'The institutions are being sheeplike. They
have gone from panic selling to panic buying in three years. It is quite
dangerous.'
'There is a limited amount of stock and a multitude of desperate
purchasers,' according to Mr Robert Maxted of Pillar Property Investment.
'Yields have moved quite dramatically in the last two weeks.'
The strong demand for property is currently centred on properties occupied
by financially secure tenants on long leases. But, gradually, frustration at
the difficulty of securing such properties will force investors to be more
adventurous.
As confidence grows, the activity in the investment market may eventually
spill over into property development. Finance for property development
remains scarce, because banks are reeling from losses incurred in the market
over recent years, but there is evidence that small schemes by developers
with a strong understanding of local markets are emerging.
High profile schemes, such as the City landmark that Lord Palumbo wants to
create, will probably remain rarities for some years. Nonetheless, the One
Poultry project provides palpable evidence that developers are prepared to
risk a comeback.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: When too much weight is given to
verbal element of human intelligence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN PITTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the jobs column of September 15 ('Why established theory is now
suspect'), Michael Dixon asked if readers might suggest explanations of the
apparent paradox of an autistic person, almost incapable of communicating by
speech, being enormously creative in music and the visual arts. May I
suggest that the explanation lies in the role of speech and the ability of
the brain to convert thoughts into words.
We do not think entirely in words. We, like other animals, do a lot of
thinking in non-verbal ways. We then develop our thoughts by using language,
both as a logical structure for analysis, and as a means of recording steps
in an analysis which would be too complex to memorise. In addition, of
course, we use it as a means of exchanging ideas and data with others.
Much of human brain power must be taken up in interpreting and using speech.
Perhaps it is analogous to the latest developments in computer technology
where a lot of additional computing power has had to be introduced to
operate graphical interfaces. These have made it easier to communicate with
the computers but have not necessarily made the computers inherently faster
or more powerful. An autistic person who has some fault in the mental
processes involved in the interpretation of speech may have excellent
faculties in the non-verbal processes of the brain.
We may have put too much weight on the verbal element in intelligence. My
cat regularly goes out into the fields and comes back quite soon with a
rabbit. He has made a study of animal behaviour and worked out a successful
strategy for obtaining a regular supply of his preferred food. He cannot
read, write or speak.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Report acknowledges energy shortages,
despite efficiencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL JEFFERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A few words of clarification on Bronwen Maddox's thorough article on
our Renewable Energy Resources report and references to the World Energy
Council Commission Report, Energy for Tomorrow's World (Business and the
Environment: 'Answers in the wind', September 15):
The commission does point out that under a 'business as usual' evolution, or
even quite rapid improvements in energy efficiency, the world is likely to
run short of oil and natural gas around the middle of the next century
despite improved technology and rising real prices.
However, the commission also points out that an ecologically driven case
(though our case has extremely testing assumptions on energy efficiency for
policymakers and consumers), which expands 'new' renewables rapidly, would
avoid that - particularly if generally acceptable nuclear power were also to
be more widely available.
If, on running short of oil and gas, people think they can simply switch to
coal, they will find only temporary relief. If this is the only option taken
up, the world is likely to run short of coal around 2100 even if the
environmental impacts could be mitigated.
'Traditional biomass' was excluded because its main component, fuelwood, is
widely used in an unsustainable manner. Large hydro also raises problems.
Ms Maddox rightly states that the Renewables Report says too little on the
future costs of renewables - but this is because too little can reliably be
said. It is clear that costs in general have been coming down, and will
continue to do so.
Both the reports point out the serious local environmental impacts that
'new' renewables can have, and the need to ensure consistent, sensitive
environmental criteria are applied throughout the field of energy provision
and use.
Finally, the World Energy Council is delighted to have published the
Renewable Energy Resources Report, and its commission report has pointed out
the need for accelerated development of 'new' renewables if they are to play
a significant role in the future. Michael Jefferson,
World Energy Council,

FT  18 SEP 93 / Woman in the News: Heroine to her country's bumpkins - Anne
Enger Lahnstein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of Norway's Centre party, was in defensive mood
yesterday in her office in the Storting (parliament), still festooned with
flowers after her triumphant performance in Monday's general election.
Explaining the propensity of language-differences to pervert meanings, she
insisted on answering questions in Norwegian, despite her own good command
of English. After all, she said, leaders such as John Major, Francois
Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl would speak in their own tongues in similar
circumstances.
Her determination to control interviews stems from the suspicion that the
outside world - not to mention many urban Norwegians - regards her
resolutely anti-European Community party, now the leading opposition in
parliament, as not much more than nationalist country bumpkins grown fat on
Norway's endless stream of subsidies to its farms and regions.
It is a tag she angrily rejects. Opposition to Norway's application to join
the EC, she says, runs much wider and deeper than fears of a loss of income
by the country's rural communities, the original power base of her party.
Animatedly, she relates Norway's history of 400 years under Danish rule, a
century under the Swedish yoke that ended only in 1905 and, finally, the
bitter years of Nazi occupation during the second world war. The EC
question, she explains, is above all one of independence and
self-determination. Breaking back into English, Ms Lahnstein declares: 'We
want to take care of our own democracy, not because we feel we are better
than anyone else, but because we believe that is the best way for society.'
The clarity of this message, repeated relentlessly during the campaign and
always accompanied by her impish smile, struck a deep chord with many
Norwegians whose hostility to EC membership propelled the Centre party to
its best election result, tripling its representation in the 165-seat
Storting to 32 and overtaking a demoralised pro-EC Conservative party as the
biggest opposition party.
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's ruling Labour party managed to
survive the storm. But it remains a minority government and now faces
guerrilla political warfare with the buoyant Ms Lahnstein and her party as
Labour attempts to reverse anti-EC sentiment and win an eventual referendum
on membership.
Ms Lahnstein, a nurse by training, is credited by Mr Johan J Jakobsen, her
immediate predecessor as leader, for having lifted the Centre party to such
heights since she took over two years ago as the head of what was then only
the sixth-largest group in the Storting.
In a country where women now dominate the top political positions, Ms
Lahnstein, 43, has none of the authoritative stature of Mrs Brundtland or
the intellectual aura of Mrs Kaci Kullmann-Five, the Conservative leader.
But she outshone both on the campaign trail with her forthright views and
the youthful passion with which she conveyed them. The Centre party suddenly
found itself winning voters on a scale it had scarcely imagined before. It
now has MPs in each of the country's multi-member constituencies and it is
clear that support is drawn from a wider pool than the 4 per cent of the
population still earning their living on the land.
Today, the Centre party has become a lightning rod for the anti-EC camp. It
has skilfully exploited the perception that EC membership would undermine
Norway's independence by threatening 'the Norwegian way' of elaborate rural
subsidies, which support the population in the country's far-flung and
frigid regions. 'I think we are talking about a very important question for
people - how to take care of this country,' says Ms Lahnstein. 'It is a
rough and tough life in many districts with long distances and a harsh
climate. This toughness is part of the Norwegian people's self-image.'
Many Norwegians who no longer live in rural communities nevertheless
continue to respond warmly to this thinking - which conveniently allows the
Centre party to continue to defend its traditional core agricultural
constituency and steal support from Labour among fishermen. Ms Lahnstein
admits that food production in Norway is 'not cheap'. IMF figures show
subsidies make up 77 per cent of the value of agricultural output in Norway,
compared with an EC average of 49 per cent. But she estimates 70,000
Norwegian farmers would go out of production if the country joined the
Community.
Instead, the Centre party is prepared to go on paying a high price to
sustain Norway's uncompetitive farming - a price that to date has been
financed from North Sea oil revenues. Ms Lahnstein is unimpressed by
arguments that access to EC markets would benefit Norway's underdeveloped
food processing sector, adding to exports. 'Exports are not so important for
us,' she says. 'Most important is to feed our own population and not have to
import more food. The 50 per cent we import now is enough.' Party policy,
indeed, calls for Norway to scrap its participation in the European Economic
Area trade pact with the EC due to take effect soon.
Reversing Norway's commitment to the EEA is not realistic, however, as it is
already ratified by parliament. Rather, Ms Lahnstein's challenge now is to
maintain the momentum of the election in her crusade against full Community
membership. She has plenty of ringing phrases left over from the campaign to
carry her forward. 'So many people dream of the new Europe. But ask the
people what will be the result of this. It will be too much power in too few
hands and too much power for money. I think it is good for the common people
to work where they live and to stay with their families,' she declares.
Then she prepares to head to her hytte, or country cottage, near her own
family's home east of Oslo for the weekend. 'I'm going back to my roots,'
she says.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Keeping the lid on pay rises: The public sector is unlikely
to rebel over a freeze on wages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the public sector lead a revolt against the UK government's economic
strategy? Four days after the announcement from Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor, that public sector pay bills would be frozen next year, and four
days before unions meet at TUC headquarters to plan their resistance, the
answer is: probably not.
Nearly a quarter of British workers are employed in the public sector, but
attitudes towards it remain ambivalent - a mixture of admiration for the
health and emergency services and disdain for much of central and local
government.
The planned pay bill freeze did not provoke an immediate wave of revulsion
similar to last year's pit closure plan. But neither did tabloid newspapers
strongly support the government's plan to pay wage increases only for those
workers who improve productivity. The editorial in The Sun newspaper asked:
'How can a nurse be more productive . . . Carry two bedpans at once?'
The public sector unions, representing more than 70 per cent of the 5.5m
public sector workers, are also in uncertain mood. Privately, some union
officials doubt a TUC co-ordinated campaign would have much effect, and fear
that 'demagogic public sector union leaders outbidding each other in
bellicosity will let the government off the hook', as one senior official
put it.
Sceptical, too, about industrial action is the Labour head of personnel in
one inner-London borough: 'Legal restrictions make it difficult for the
activists to set things alight these days. And are people really going to
take to the streets for social workers on Pounds 22,000 a year who, like
virtually all our employees, still have excellent job security?'
Nonetheless, there are low-paid parts of the public sector which attract
public support. The Fire Brigades Union will be doing its best to embarrass
the government, despite the fact that its own privileged pay formula looks
certain to be reinstated next year after this year's pay curbs. Many
activists in the all-embracing new public services union, Unison, will also
want to show off the union's muscle.
But by allowing for pay rises based on improvements in efficiency, the
government is defusing much potential discontent. Many public sector
workers, probably even most, will get rises of some kind, in the order of
1-3 per cent.
From the government's point of view the pay bill freeze has the double
advantage of capping the single largest item of public expenditure - the
public sector pay bill is Pounds 87.3bn for 1994-95 - while hastening the
transformation of bargaining from national to local level. One public sector
manager said yesterday that it would provide just the 'leverage' that he
needs to make pay bargaining more flexible after the 'straitjacket' of the
national 1.5 per cent limit this year.
These benefits would seem justification enough for the freeze without
claiming, as some ministers are doing, that in a 'post-inflationary' era the
annual pay rise is dead. This claim is premature: not only is inflation
expected to be back over 3 per cent next year but the private sector is less
of a model than it might seem.
Manufacturing industry is witnessing a sharp reduction in unit labour costs
as output picks up. But for those who have kept their jobs (in a sector
which has shed about 17 per cent of its workers in the past three years)
earnings are rising at 5 per cent a year, nearly three times the rate of
inflation.
Pay freezes in the private sector have been more common in the latest
recession than the early 1980s. But according to the Confederation of
British Industry, only 12 per cent of companies had freezes last year. Also,
the revival of interest in pay deals of longer than one year has been
modest, as in past periods of relatively steady inflation, according to pay
analysts.
What might be changing is that a greater divergence between pay rises in the
public and private sectors is now possible partly because of high
unemployment. A widening gap would allow the government to squeeze public
sector pay not just for the sake of its own balance sheet, but also to send
a clear signal of restraint to the private sector. Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the CBI, claims the current 1.5 per cent limit on public
sector wages has helped to cut 1 percentage point off private sector pay
this year.
Over the past 15 years, pay rises in the two sectors have oscillated around
each other. The private sector usually pulls ahead in economic upswings with
the public sector clawing back in downturns or just before elections.
Average pay in the public sector (Pounds 308 a week) in 1992 was slightly
higher than in the private sector (Pounds 303 a week) but that is usually
the case because the public sector has, proportionately, more white-collar
and professional staff. Comparing similar jobs, such as middle managers, the
private sector usually pays slightly better, except for women and the
low-paid.
Looking at annual pay increases since 1979, one finds the private sector has
risen slightly faster than the public sector and is expected to open up a
6-7 percentage point gap as a result of public sector pay restrictions this
year and next.
That may have a negative effect on morale, and therefore on services, as
several of the five independent public sector pay review bodies have argued
in the past. But at a time of high unemployment it will not necessarily
cause people to leave their jobs for the private sector, especially as many
public sector jobs do not have a parallel in the private sector.
The case for pay parity in the public sector is often countered by the
argument that employees enjoy greater job security. That has been true
through this recession, but could be ending as public sector managers offer
big pay rises in exchange for changes in working practices and job cuts. The
outcome could resemble the big increases in pay and job cuts experienced by
the utilities privatisation.
If the effect of privatisation is stripped out, the public sector can be
seen still to employ nearly as many people as it did 15 years ago. But in
the next two or three years, hundreds of thousands of jobs could go. Mr Eric
Caines, former head of personnel at the NHS, believes nearly one-fifth of
950,000 jobs in the health service could be cut.
One civil service manager pointed out that a recruitment freeze throughout
the public sector for one year would mean 'losing' nearly 500,000 new jobs
but would allow remaining staff a pay rise of well over 5 per cent.
The fear of public sector managers is not so much that the unions will opt
for jobs rather than pay rises but that the government will want to keep the
proceeds of any savings. 'The Treasury will want to have its cake and eat
it, too,' said one manager.
For the time being, the government appears to have judged the mood of the
country correctly, and is unlikely to face more than scattered local
strikes. But, as one government economist put it: 'The Pounds 2.5bn we save
now on public sector pay we could easily lose over the next two or three
years from the increase in unemployment created by speeding up the public
sector shake-out.' In which case, what looks like a good idea next year
might not look so good for Mr Clarke and the government as the next election
approaches.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVES who dream of replacing Mr John Major with a charismatic
leader, or one more to this or that political taste, would do well to pause
before unsheathing their daggers less than three years after the Tories
dismissed the then Mrs Thatcher, and willingly chose Mr Major to replace
her. It is less than 18 months since he led them to an unexpected general
election victory.
Following a campaign in which the central figure was Mr Major himself, the
Conservatives attracted 14.1m votes. No other UK party, and no other prime
minister, has ever won so many. British democracy would be damaged if he
were now to be replaced merely to suit the political convenience of his
party.
This does not mean that Mr Major can regard his hold on office as secure.
Unlike the president of the US he was not elected for a fixed term,
removable only by impeachment or the threat of it. A UK prime minister keeps
his job for just so long as he can command a working majority in the House
of Commons. When he loses the confidence of his own colleagues he, or she,
must go. It is that confidence that Mr Major is finding it so difficult to
maintain.
The fault is partly his own. The election was fought on the proposition that
the recession would end as soon as the government was returned. Voters who
found that it did not were understandably annoyed. Speeches made by the
prime minister before sterling was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism
a year ago sounded hollow in the aftermath of Black Wednesday. The authority
lost by Mr Major on that fateful day has not been regained. The government's
handling of much of its business, notably the plan to close coalmines, has
been inept. The prime minister's hesitant and incomplete changes in his
cabinet have added to an impression that he is a weak leader.
Disgruntled
It is not obvious, however, that any conceivable successor would find the
job more manageable. The government was returned with a majority of only 21
in April 1992; that figure has since fallen to 17 as a result of by-election
losses in Newbury and Christchurch. This gives disproportionate power, and
publicity, to disgruntled backbenchers seeking the limelight. Some dismissed
ministers have permitted themselves to become resentful and destructive
ordinary members, as shown by the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, this
week.
The deep divisions among Conservatives over European policy persist, in
spite of the passage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. There is a
genuine debate over the desirability of further increasing taxation in the
November Budget. The party may unite around the new chancellor's proposal to
squeeze public sector pay, but if the consequence is that services are
curtailed the process is unlikely to win popular support for the Tories, the
prime minister, or even the usually affable Mr Kenneth Clarke. Should the
latter replace Mr Major he would find that his undoubtedly superior
political skills would not in themselves suffice to turn the Conservatives'
fortunes around.
Fractious
The truth is that the Tories' fall in the opinion polls cannot be blamed on
Mr Major alone. The real problem is the present condition of the
Conservative party. In office since 1979, it has become fractious, divided,
uncertain of its own destination or that of the country. The frequent
complaint that the prime minister lacks vision might be directed at the
party itself. Potential successors vary in the images they project of the
kind of British society they would aspire to construct. There is no single
Conservative mission.
One of the by-products of the political cycle is that losing parties can
refresh their thinking while out of office. The Conservatives achieved this
most famously after 1945, and again in the years leading up to their victory
in 1979. A spell of opposition has its benefits. The Tories enjoy no such
luxury today. They are still in the early years of a new parliament. They
must find a means of re-energising themselves while still in power. If Mr
Major can show at the forthcoming party conference, or in the months
thereafter, that such an exercise can take place under his leadership, he
will have justified the confidence placed in him by the country at election
time.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Dream scenario fades: Mildly disappointing economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was all looking too good to be true - until this week.
Britain had seemed to be experiencing a near perfect economic recovery in
recent months. Falling unemployment, manufacturing output bounding ahead,
soaring productivity, a steady increase in consumer demand, robust exports
and unexpectedly low price rises combined to foster the belief that the UK
might be on course to achieving that holy grail of policymakers: sustained
non-inflationary growth.
Now, after a week of mildly disappointing official statistics, is not the
time to consign the recovery to the dustbin. But the news that manufacturing
output is growing by about 2 per cent rather than 3 per cent a year, and
that seasonally adjusted unemployment has risen by 10,000 over the past two
months after five consecutive months of decline, has brought the pundits
back to earth.
Sceptical Treasury officials had worried quietly that the 'dream scenario'
of the recent past did not add up. With continental Europe in what may be
its worst recession since the second world war, and an overhang in Britain
of personal debt and negative equity in the housing market, it always looked
more likely that recovery would be hesitant and patchy.
That now seems to be the case. This week's news that retail prices rose by
1.7 per cent in the year to August (compared with 1.2 per cent in June, when
the annual 'headline' inflation rate appears to have bottomed out) will make
it more difficult for the government to achieve its goal of a freeze on
public sector pay bills. But the fact that inflation is creeping upwards,
together with evidence of a less buoyant recovery, makes economy-wide pay
restraint more essential for future economic welfare.
Downward revisions to the industrial production figures over the first half
of this year have led to a reappraisal of productivity and unit labour
costs.
In mid-August, Department of Employment figures had suggested that Britain
might be enjoying a productivity miracle. The government reported that
output per head in manufacturing increased by 10.5 per cent in May compared
with the year before.
With 9.5 per cent year-on-year growth, May's revised productivity figure
still looks good. But annual growth of manufacturing output per head in June
and July has been less spectacular: at 5.1 and 5.5 per cent respectively.
The latest unit labour cost developments put the competitiveness of British
business in a less flattering light. Official government figures in August
showed that wages and salaries per unit of output fell by 5.3 per cent in
the year to May. That decline was revised to 4.4 per cent this week, when
the Department of Employment also reported sharply lower falls in unit
labour costs in manufacturing industry, of 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent in
the 12 months to June and July respectively.
These figures cover only manufacturing, which is less than a quarter of the
economy, and they are liable to revision. Provisional productivity and unit
wage cost figures for the whole economy in the first half of this year are
due to be released next week.
But the statistics strongly suggest that the annual growth of average
earnings at its present historically low rate of 3.5 per cent offers no
grounds for complacency. In particular, from the government's viewpoint, the
present 5 per cent annual increase in underlying earnings in manufacturing
is too high for comfort: it does little for the competitiveness of British
industry and undermines the case for public sector pay restraint.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Shocked by sound money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A period of exceptional buoyancy in world stock markets, investors
ought to be feeling exceptionally cheerful. Yet, paradoxically, many who
belong to the world's rentier class - retired people in the main - are
feeling poorer. Indeed part of the surge in the markets in recent months has
reflected panic buying of any form of investment that appeared to offer a
less paltry return than a deposit account at the bank. In effect, the urge
to compensate for a decline in nominal incomes is driving more and more old
people into high-risk assets in remoter markets. This is unfamiliar and
dangerous territory for a generation that came to regard high inflation as
the norm; and the nature of a rising market that makes some people feel
poorer bears thinking about.
What investors are now discovering is that unexpected disinflation can be
quite as arbitrary in its impact on incomes and wealth as unexpected
inflation. At first sight, there are some obviously symmetrical features in
the transition from the one process to the other. Borrowers who gained at
the expense of savers when inflation eroded their liabilities now find
themselves paying exorbitant real rates of interest. Yet it is on the asset
side of the personal sector's balance sheet that shocks are taking place and
where the money illusion created by inflation is turning into money
disillusion.
Perverse result
A collapse in nominal interest rates on bank deposits would not matter
overmuch if there were still a significant real return after allowing for
lower inflation. But in some countries, most notably the US, the real return
is now next to zero. In Britain it can still be possible to obtain a modest
positive real return on deposits. But savers' perceptions tend to be geared
to nominal rates, which have fallen sharply. They are thus desperate for
high-yielding assets, including fixed-rate bonds for which they have
hitherto had a marked aversion. The perverse result is that the chief
victims of inflation, older people, now feel that they are suffering as much
from the cure as the disease. Even more paradoxically, governments may
actually be subsidising savers at the taxpayer's expense by issuing long
bonds at too high a coupon, having earlier used inflation as a form of
hidden taxation.
Nobody can be sure what impact this is having on aggregate savings
behaviour. But it is conceivable that some people are saving more as
inflation comes down, just as they once saved more in response to an
acceleration in inflation. This would put an additional damper on an already
sluggish, debt-constrained recovery. Wall Street economist Henry Kaufman has
also argued that the emergence of the household sector as a bigger financial
risk-taker, swapping fixed-rate deposits for securities whose capital value
goes up and down, could increase financial volatility and cause consumption
to become more cyclical.
Less consumption
Inflation did, of course, cause the capital value of fixed-rate deposits to
change in real terms, so the increase in risk can be overstated. In the UK,
the postwar shift from a market dominated by private individuals to one
overwhelmingly captured by professional investors appeared, if anything, to
result in more rather than less volatility - a point that might run counter
to Kaufman's thesis. But perceptions are what counts; and it is not
implausible that a fall in market prices today might lead to a greater
negative wealth effect, and thus less consumption, than the earlier
inflationary erosion of capital in the 1970s.
One benign consequence of all this is that the banking system will be less
vulnerable to shocks. Money and mutual funds are not banking intermediaries;
if they invest in risky certificates of deposit in Thailand or junk bonds in
Argentina, the loss falls directly on investors. But if funds are prone to
move suddenly from the capital markets into the banking system and back, it
will wreak havoc with the monetary aggregates. And regulators will confront
more Barlow Clowes-type scandals, which will be hard to prevent in a global
retail investment market. Investors should remember, in their increasingly
desperate search for income, that fat returns invariably imply ferociously
big risks.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Birt pledges extra Pounds 75m savings in next two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Birt, director-general of the BBC, yesterday said that in the next
two years the corporation would save an extra Pounds 75m which would be put
into programmes.
The savings - Pounds 50m next year and Pounds 25m the year after - will
follow the Pounds 100m savings expected in the current financial year. They
come largely from reduced BBC bureaucracy and from the introduction of
Producer Choice, the controversial system which allows producers to buy
services from the outside market.
Mr Birt told the Royal Television Society's Cambridge convention: 'It is
ludicrous to present it (Producer Choice) as a shambles.'
He was speaking the day after Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary,
praised the BBC governors and management for improvements in the corporation
and the courage shown in tackling difficult issues.
Mr Brooke warned, however: 'If the BBC had not made, and does not continue
to make changes, the future of the licence fee in the short term and of the
BBC itself in the longer term might need to be considered from a very
different perspective.'
The statement was seen as tacit government support for the reforms
introduced by Mr Birt.
A government white paper on the renewal of the BBC's Royal Charter is due in
the next six months. The principle of the BBC licence fee is not expected to
be in doubt, but proposals for change could include the privatisation of the
BBC transmitter network.
Mr Alan Yentob, BBC 1 controller, yesterday accepted suggestions that
ideally he needed an additional Pounds 50m to Pounds 100m for programme
scheduling. BBC 1 is to receive Pounds 60m from the planned Pounds 100m
savings.
Mr Yentob accepted that this summer's level of repeats had probably been too
high. Repeats on BBC television are running at about 20 per cent during
prime time.
The BBC is to cut up to 131 jobs through a merger in research and
development, it said yesterday. The savings of more than Pounds 5m will go
to programme-making.
The corporation said that some redundancies would be achieved by not
renewing contracts, but that there may be compulsory job losses.
The plan to merge engineering research and development, currently run as two
separate departments with 281 staff, will take effect from April 1 next
year.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Lib Dems focus on full employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats will next week be asked to approve a paper advocating
financial incentives to encourage job-sharing, flexi-time, part-time jobs
and working from home, as the party's economic policy puts a new emphasis on
full employment.
The policy paper, Facing up to the Future, represents a further stage in the
leadership's efforts to establish a distinctive political identity for the
party.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, accepts that spelling out the
Liberal Democrat stance across a range of policies could lead to the loss of
some former Conservative voters, but appears to regard that as a price worth
paying for a sharper image.
'There is no long-term role for a third party - except hitting occasional
peaks here and there - if it is all things to all people,' he said. 'I want
people to take sides about the Lib Dems. I want them to love us and hate
us.'
The document, to be discussed by grassroots party members at the annual
conference in Torquay, which starts on Monday, marks a change of economic
strategy after last year's policy paper was criticised at last year's
conference for being too right wing.
The latest policy document is much more cautious about relying on market
forces to regenerate the economy.
The new emphasis on full employment is a reaction to anger on the subject at
last year's conference and Mr Ashdown's own long-term concern about
structural unemployment. He said that resolving the issue will involve
redistributing existing jobs as well as creating new ones.
Mr Ashdown said he believed that if society is based on the idea that the
citizen must have a job to maintain his or her dignity, then politicians
must consider what the consequences could be if unemployment becomes a
permanent feature of the economy. 'If that's so, then you'd better redefine
employment, otherwise you blow your society apart,' he said.
Mr Ashdown identified housing and the welfare system as the labour market's
two prime rigidities.
If flexible working practices are to be adopted without damaging the
competitiveness of British industry, then the benefits system will need to
be substantially altered to stop it acting as a barrier to jobs, he said.
While this approach to full employment is only one aspect of the framework
paper to be discussed next week, the fact that there will also be separate
debates on workers' rights and structural unemployment underlines the
importance of the issue in defining the party's position.
Mr Ashdown said he believed that the party must seize the opportunity of use
the conference to address its perennial difficulty - that no one knows what
it stands for. 'I'd like people to say . . . the Lib Dems have identified
that as the area in which they must work and they're beginning to map out a
very clear message,' he said. 'That's our task for the year ahead.'

FT  18 SEP 93 / ICI to end free hamper scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI ON Teesside is to stop giving free Christmas hampers to its pensioners
in order to save money as it continues its restructuring.
Since hamper distribution began 25 years ago, the number of people
qualifying has grown more than fifteenfold to well over 15,000, and now
threatens to be twice the number of ICI staff in the area.
The cost of issuing the hampers now exceeds Pounds 200,000 a year - a sum
described by ICI as prohibitive.
The news that this year's Christmas hamper will be the last broke in a
letter to the pensioners from Mr David Allan, ICI on Teesside's personnel
manager.
The TGWU general union deplored the move, but ICI said some pensioners had
said they understood the decision.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Boundary changes could hit Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSED constituency boundary changes could damage the prospects of the
Conservative party in next year's European elections and further undermine
the efforts of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to strengthen his hold on
10 Downing Street.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats seem likely to be the principal
beneficiaries of an initial re-drawing of the English section of the
European political map to accommodate five additional members of the
European parliament.
In accordance with the agreement reached at last year's EC summit in
Edinburgh, the number of English MEPs elected next June will be increased to
71.
The proposals, which are still subject to change, involve boundary changes
affecting all but 12 of the existing 66 constituencies.
Under the proposals, the Liberal Democrats would have high hopes of winning
in a newly created Somerset constituency, which would be their first success
since the introduction of direct elections for the European Parliament.
The party would also hope for a victory in the Plymouth and Cornwall seat
where they came second in 1989.
Details of the proposed changes will be officially announced on Wednesday.
Political parties and other interests have until October 22 to submit
counter-proposals. The committee will make its final recommendations to Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, before Christmas.
Controversy has already flared over proposals to increase the number of
Welsh Euro constituencies from four to five.
The suggestion that two new constituencies should be created through merging
Gwynedd and Dyfed and Powys and Clwyd has been attacked by Mr Alex Carlile,
Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Wheat harvest reaches record 14m tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS in the UK produced more wheat per hectare this year than ever
before, in spite of a decline of 3 per cent in the overall harvest of
grains, according to estimates by Dalgety Agriculture.
The amount of wheat harvested rose by 700,000 tonnes to 14m tonnes, which
will give arable farmers roughly Pounds 1.4bn at current prices.
However, prices are likely to have to fall in order to shift the surplus
production of 4.4m tonnes on to already over-supplied world markets. They
could fall by about Pounds 5 a tonne from about Pounds 100 a tonne.
Dalgety, which surveyed 900 farms to produce its crop predictions, said the
wheat crop increased because of good weather in the growing season and
improvements in seed quality.
Mr Andrew Barnard, Dalgety's arable crop marketing manager, pointed out that
wheat tonnages rose in spite of a 13 per cent reduction in the area planted
because of reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy
which encourages farmers to leave some land to lie fallow - the so-called
'set-aside' programme.
He said it pointed to the fact that the programme was not working as farmers
left their worst land fallow and improved yields on the rest.
The National Farmers' Union said: 'Set-aside causes mixed feelings among
farmers: it is a policy devised by politicians. But it is difficult to take
one harvest in isolation as an indication of trends.'
Overall production of grains fell slightly to 20.9m tonnes because of poor
yields of barley, particularly in Scotland.
Dalgety estimates that oilseed rape will prove profitable for the majority
of UK farmers, although plantings were depressed, because of adverse weather
during the sowing season. About 1m tonnes are expected - down from 1.2m
tonnes last year.
Wheat yields were a bumper 7.8 tonnes per hectare, but the quality of the
wheat crop was affected by heavy rain in some areas at the beginning of the
harvest season.
The lower protein content of part of the wheat crop could see millers
importing an extra 1.3m tonnes to blend with domestic grain, Dalgety
estimates.
Demand from animal feeds producers for this year's wheat is set to rise 10
per cent because of lower prices.
Barley quality was high, which will help farmers sell it at home and abroad,
although demand from maltsters and distillers, at an estimated 1.5m tonnes,
has not recovered from highs of 4 years ago.
Farmers are estimated to have produced 271,000 tonnes of linseed, the
distinctive blue plant, which has enjoyed a huge rise in plantings in the UK
in recent years.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Short shrift for another chequered British loser: Why it
looks like the chess hype may have to stop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS British challenger Nigel Short enters the sixth round of the World Chess
Championship today, he will not be alone in hoping for a win.
With Short so far having failed to win a single game in the series against
the defending champion Garry Kasparov, fears are growing about the fortunes
of Short and the much-hyped tournament.
One sure sign of concern is that William Hill, official match bookmakers,
has withdrawn bets on an overall Kasparov win - while still offering 3-1 on
Short failing to win a match, and 12-1 on a Short victory. 'We are desperate
for Nigel Short to win a game, otherwise this is going to be a dead duck,'
said William Hill. 'If Nigel loses a couple more games, the papers are just
going to start to forget about it. The hype will just die.'
Teleworld, the telecommunications company and joint sponsor of the match,
this week withdrew its 'predict-a-move' telephone chess line, which allowed
viewers in Europe to second guess the moves and phone in at a premium rate
of between 36 pence and 48 pence a minute. Teleworld says that it needed
2,000 players placing several calls a match to make it worthwhile. The
maximum at any match was 500 calls.
Mr Wytze de Back, vice chairman of Teleworld corporate communications, said:
'We are very disappointed. But there just wasn't enough interest, and so
this was the only wise decision.'
The Times newspaper, which provided the bulk of the Pounds 1.7m prize money
and tried to whip up chess fever with heavy pre-match advertising, is still
faithful - devoting almost a page a day to the match. Most UK newspapers
have quietly relegated it to a brief mention.
Channel Four, which bought exclusive television rights, reportedly for
Pounds 250,000, and plans 60 hours of coverage, insists that viewing figures
are better than expected. And though the match hall at the Savoy Theatre has
appeared half-empty during matches, the organisers insist that at least
two-thirds of the 1,000 tickets for each game have been sold for the matches
so far.
Ms Mary Fultan, speaking for the promotors, said: 'The reason you see empty
seats is because people come and go. Lots of people have gone off to the
bar, because there is coverage there as well.' But with 18 games to go, and
tickets already selling for about half their initial prices of between
Pounds 45 and Pounds 150, the sponsors will be hard-pressed to recoup much
of their investment.
The company hopes that the computer network it established can be used for
other projects, and suggests that the main reason for predict-a-move's
failure was the conservative nature of the chess world. 'We advertised in
all the chess magazines, but perhaps the product is a bit new,' said Mr de
Back.
He also acknowledges the sheer complexity of chess - and the problem of
maintaining a British interest when once again, a Briton looks like being a
loser.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Investment agencies face fight for funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INWARD investment agencies in the UK face sharply increased worldwide
competition in the 1990s to secure a much reduced number of new greenfield
projects, Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Northern Development Company,
warned yesterday.
Globalisation of production also poses a threat as international companies
operating at world-class manufacturing standards concentrate production on
only a few plants worldwide, instead of investing in capacity in every
market they serve.
Addressing the annual general meeting of the NDC, the economic regeneration
body for north-east England and Cumbria, Sir Ron said that much of the
inward investment in the 1980s was driven by the need for international
companies' to be inside the European Community as the single market
approached.
Since early 1985, the NDC area attracted more than 320 investments from
overseas, worth Pounds 3bn, with 37,000 jobs. This was more than 10 per cent
of all UK inward investment in the 1980s.
Sir Ron said competition for the fewer investments now available was coming
not only from EC countries but eastern and central Europe; equally companies
serving world markets were looking at sites in the Pacific Rim, South East
Asia and Central America.
Against this 'bleak analysis', said Sir Ron, it would be wrong to draw too
much comfort in regional terms from the emergence of the domestic economy
from recession, excellent news though that was. Nor could the north, in
spite of the fact that it has the UK's highest regional unemployment, expect
great help from outside as the entire nation had problems.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Lang firm on local authority reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday dismissed as 'an amusing
diversion' the campaign of non co-operation being waged by some local
authorities against his proposals for reforming local government in
Scotland.
He said that the reform - which involves creating 28 single-tier authorities
in 1996 to replace the present nine regional, three island and 53 district
councils - would go ahead regardless of whether local authorities
co-operated. It would strengthen local government in Scotland, he said.
The Labour-dominated Convention of Scottish Local Authorities decided in
late July to ban councillors and officials from speaking to the Scottish
Office about implementing the reforms, which will be contained in a bill in
the next session of parliament.
But the non-co-operation campaign is faltering, with many councils refusing
to support it. Yesterday the campaign came under attack from several
speakers at a Glasgow conference on the reforms.
A councillor from Sutherland District Council, which is to disappear under
the new structure, said that it was folly to try to influence the government
without talking to it.
Professor Arthur Midwinter, from Strathclyde University, called the
non-co-operation campaign irrelevant and a diversion from the main issues.
But Mr Charles Gray, a councillor and president of the convention, said that
the non-co-operation policy would remain in force.
The government has told councils that they could face financial difficulties
if they refuse to co-operate. The Scottish Office has asked councils to bid
for any special funding they may require to prepare for reorganisation next
year, and said that if they do not reply they might not receive the aid.
Labour opposes the reform because the government has not employed an
independent commission to draw the new boundaries, leading to charges that
it has 'gerrymandered' the new council map.

FT  18 SEP 93 / British National party expected to focus on the capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMMEDIATE question posed by the British National party's victory in
London's Docklands was whether the party would now break through to success
in other local authority elections.
In a statement issued after his win in Tower Hamlets, the BNP's candidate Mr
Derek Beackon spoke pointedly of 'the Isle of Dogs and nearby Greenwich'
once being the heart of Britain's greatness as a trading and maritime
nation.
The BNP puts substantial effort into organising in parts of the borough of
Greenwich - the presence of its bookshop in Bexley, just outside the area,
is a frequent source of tension with anti-racist campaigners. It is likely
that the party will concentrate heavily on next year's London elections,
fielding candidates in Greenwich and boroughs such as Hackney, Newham and
Brent as well as trying to make further gains in Tower Hamlets.
Representatives of the mainstream parties were yesterday of the view that
the BNP will find it impossible to maintain momentum in next May's
elections, and will lose its Isle of Dogs seat.
A similar view was taken of its prospects elsewhere in the country. Mr Nigel
Todd, a Labour councillor in Newcastle upon Tyne and a founder member of the
Tyne and Wear Anti-Fascist Association, said he thought there was little
chance of the BNP doing as well in north-east England.
Mr Malik Chaudhry, housing officer of the Tyne and Wear Racial Equality
Council, said there were signs that Sunderland was being targeted by
far-right groups.
'Sunderland has seen increased activity in a rather organised way,' he said.
'It looks like there have been incidents where they have been leafleting,
putting up stickers and insignias.'
Mr Chaudhry said there had also been incidents of racial attacks on housing
estates in Sunderland. People had had to be rehoused, he said.
Mr Sukhdev Grewal, acting regional officer for the Commission for Racial
Equality in the north of England and Scotland, said the BNP and the National
Front tried, without success, to win council seats in Durham a few years
ago.
In Cardiff, the BNP stood in the May local elections in the Glan Ely ward,
but its candidate came bottom of the poll - with just 47 votes.
The Ely area was the scene last year of a riot sparked by an attack on an
Asian shopkeeper, and some members of the Asian community are said to still
feel threatened. But political observers in Cardiff say that attempts to
exploit hostile feelings by extremists appear to have come from outside the
area.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Major discusses Paisley plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DELEGATION of the Democratic Unionist party from Northern Ireland, led by
the Rev Ian Paisley MP, met Mr John Major, the prime minister, at Downing
Street yesterday to discuss the DUP's latest proposals on the future
administration of the province.
These are contained in a DUP document - Breaking the Logjam - which was
announced earlier this week, although no details have been made public.
There have been stirrings of hope that the proposals might open the way for
renewed round-table talks in Northern Ireland between the main
constitutional parties, after the collapse of talks last November without
any agreement on new constitutional arrangements. Mr Major told Mr Paisley
that he and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, would study the
document.
Both the British and Irish governments last week re-affirmed their
commitment to restart the talks process if they could persuade the
participants to meet again.
It is thought unlikely that the DUP will retreat from its position that it
will not return to the negotiating table unless the Irish Republic drops its
claim to Northern Ireland.
Mr William McCrea, DUP MP for Mid-Ulster, said there could be no dialogue
with Dublin as long as Articles Two and Three - on territorial claims -
remained in place.
The party has since added a further pre-condition that Mr John Hume, the
SDLP leader, must first terminate his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader
of Sinn Fein.
Mr Hume met Mr Major on Thursday. He told the prime minister that the SDLP
was prepared to return to the negotiating table provided there were no
pre-conditions.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Ofwat set to fix water charges for next decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFWAT, the water industry regulator, will announce next July annual
percentage increases covering water bills for the next 10 years.
The price rises will come into effect from April 1, 1995 and will apply
until the year 2005. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said yesterday
that 'price setting will not be a process of negotiation'.
His statement followed comments from water company executives and investors
who have said they expected the new price rules to emerge from 'horse
trading' between Ofwat and the water companies.
Ofwat and the companies will spend the next six months trying to resolve
disagreements before the companies submit their business plans to Ofwat.
The industry has clashed with its regulator in the past two years over the
rate of return - a measure of profitability - which it should be allowed to
earn on new investment. The issue, which remains unresolved, is central to
the calculation of future prices because it determines how much of the cost
of the industry's current Pounds 45bn investment programme is passed on to
customers.
Between April and July next year, Ofwat plans to examine every business plan
and set draft price rises for each company on a confidential basis.
Companies will then be given the chance to respond in writing before a
single meeting with Mr Byatt, which 'would be the final opportunity for
companies to bring to (his) attention any points which they wish him to
consider'.
The process is the first wide-ranging review of water prices since the 1989
privatisation.
Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, said: 'All the
companies will be glad to have clarification of the procedures and it is
good that there is going to be some consultation through the final meeting.'

FT  18 SEP 93 / Vodafone tariff cuts intensify price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the UK's leading cellular mobile operator, has cut its London and
low-user tariffs to match those offered by Cellnet - intensifying the price
war in the industry.
The low-user tariff drops by 15 per cent, and a reduced-rate tariff comes in
for the London region, giving business users a 20 per cent price cut for
calls made in the London region in return for higher prices for calls made
outside.
The cuts are virtually identical to those announced by Cellnet a fortnight
ago, and reflect growing competition in the industry.
Competition was given a significant boost last week with the launch of the
Mercury One-2-One network within the M25 area. The new service features free
evening calls at week-ends for personal subscribers.
Vodafone's new London tariff - 'CapitalCall' - comprises a monthly
subscription of Pounds 20, with call charges of 20p a minute peak-rate
inside the M25 and 50p a minute outside.
Vodafone has also introduced special incentives for users with bills of more
than Pounds 62.50 a month.

writes.
Investment advisory group Matrix Securities is to try to capitalise on
renewed interest by investors - prompted by a possible Tube extension and a
proposed Pounds 1.1bn bank rescue package - with the launch of a Pounds 95m
trust.
The Matrix South Quay Trust plans to finish developing three buildings
opposite Canary Wharf by using enterprise zone tax concessions - available
for buildings started before the area's enterprise zone status ended last
year.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Shops give Sunday pledge: Big retailers seek to overcome
concerns over workers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST salvo in the autumn campaign to secure a change in the Sunday
trading laws was fired yesterday. Retailers in favour of Sunday opening
pledged to defend shop workers' rights and said they would support statutory
controls.
The move is an attempt to overcome a controversial aspect of the
government's options bill on Sunday shopping, published in July. This is the
lack of protection for future shop workers against being forced to work
Sundays.
MPs are due to debate the four options for replacing the widely flouted 1950
Shops Act in England and Wales in the coming session of parliament. An
intense round of lobbying from groups supporting the different options is
expected.
The options include unrestricted opening, partially restricted opening, and
two alternatives for limited opening.
The options do not extend protection to future shop workers, only existing
ones - an omission which some MPs and retailers have warned could derail the
attempt to reform the legislation.
Some of the UK's biggest retailers yesterday pledged to follow a formula
ensuring that no existing or future shop worker would have to work on
Sundays against their wishes. Sunday workers would also be guaranteed
premium rates of pay. The retailers included J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Argyll
(owner of Safeway), Boots, Asda, and Kingfisher (owner of Woolworths, B&amp;Q,
Comet and Superdrug).
The retailers, members of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which is
backing the option of partially restricted opening, hope to force other
employers to follow suit or risk losing employees. But they would be happy
to see the formula legally enforced.
The group said: 'We wish to make it clear that as employers we have no
objection to statutory enforcement. On the contrary, if MPs indicate that
they will settle for no less, we would urge parliament to enshrine our
formula in law.'
The latest in the growing band of campaign groups, Consumers for Sunday
Shopping, a group supporting the SHRC proposal, has designated tomorrow
National Sunday Shopping Day.
Some 3,000 stores will collect shoppers' signatures in favour of Sunday
shopping, and 5,000 balloons will be released at 16 locations throughout the
country, symbolising the 16m people said to shop on Sundays.

FT  18 SEP 93 / BT seeks to relocate most London staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications may move as many as 18,000 office jobs out of
central London under a relocation strategy being considered by an internal
review team.
The jobs would be moved out to the M25 ring, with only about 2,000 office
posts left in central London. The relocation would enable BT to rationalise
its substantial office holdings and could save the company up to Pounds 44m
in London weighting payments.
The scale of the relocation will not be decided until January. A feasibility
study was begun in July.
'The feasibility study is to determine whether it is actually possible to
transfer the posts,' BT said yesterday.
The company said the relocation plan was separate from its ambitions to cut
30,000 jobs across the country over the next two years. 'The two are not
directly linked and if (the relocation) goes ahead, most of the jobs would
simply be transferred,' it said.
The prospect of more job cuts was strongly attacked yesterday by the NCU
communications union. The 15,000 job losses projected for each of the next
two years come on top of deep cuts over the past three years.
BT's aim is mainly to reduce its engineering workforce, which is excessive
for the requirements of new technology. Clerical workers have not been
permitted to seek redundancy under the same terms as the engineers.
However, under a scheme introduced this year, engineers will be allowed to
apply to transfer to clerical posts. If enough of them do so, some clerical
workers will be eligible for the redundancy package.
Last year's redundancy package, Release 92, provided for payments as high as
Pounds 100,000 plus pension entitlement, although the average sum was much
lower.
About 20,000 employees were refused the package last year because of
oversubscription. BT said it was too early to say whether this year's
package would be fully subscribed.
BT will test a service later this month allowing customers to return their
last telephone call even if they do not know the calling number.
The six-month trial will be conducted in Perth, Scotland.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Rebels claim PM may step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY discontent with the party's leadership continued to simmer yesterday as
backbenchers speculated openly about whether - and when - Mr John Major
might resign.
While those raising fresh questions about Mr Major's authority are long-time
critics of the leader and regarded as mavericks by many of their colleagues,
their comments have reinforced the impression that the prime minister's
efforts to draw a line under the divisions and disarray of the past year
have not yet been successful.
Mr Major's allies insist, however, that he will lead the party into the next
general election, and that the Conservatives' political fortunes will
improve as people see more clearly the evidence of economic recovery.
As the prime minister left for a six-day tour of Japan and Malaysia, Sir
Richard Body, a persistent Euro-sceptic, suggested that Mr Major might leave
office 'sooner rather than later, by his own wish'.
Saying that he did not think Mr Major would want to be driven out of the
premiership, Sir Richard told BBC radio: 'He may announce his retirement at
the party conference. He's never known the rough and tumble of politics and
he is sensitive to criticism. The criticism has been going on for month
after month, it may be proving too much.'
Mr John Carlisle also claimed that Mr Major might decide to stand down. 'I
think personally he would go voluntarily if he felt that he had not the
command of the parliamentary party and the party in the constituencies, and
indeed of the people,' he said.
Mr Major's supporters see an opportunity at the party conference next month
to drive home the message that local associations want the party to unite
behind Mr Major and to cease their attacks.
They point out that in spite of the speculation about a leadership challenge
in the autumn, even Mr Major's most vociferous critics have made it clear
that they are not prepared to force a contest.
But the attacks increase the pressure on Mr Major to use his conference
speech to silence critics by setting out a clear vision of the direction in
which he is taking the party.
Last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, told workers in
his Tunbridge Wells constituency that Tories needed 'self-discipline,
steadiness and teamwork'.
'Conservatives in the country can stomach anything but disloyalty . . ,' he
said. 'They want to see staunch support for the prime minister.'

FT  18 SEP 93 / Docks community pours out its bitterness in by-election: The
fears and frustrations simmering on the Isle of Dogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY TWO seconds, day and night, the flashing of a beacon high on Canary
Wharf tower in London's Docklands can be seen up-river at Westminster.
The election late on Thursday night of a British National party councillor
on the Isle of Dogs in Docklands turned it into a warning light for the
mainstream political parties.
The initial reaction to the victory has been a focus on the unusual politics
of the London borough of Tower Hamlets, where the Liberal Democrats control
the council, but Labour runs the Isle of Dogs. Relations between the two
parties are often sour, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader,
yesterday set up an inquiry after Labour said that Liberal Democrat election
material had been racist.
But the fears and frustrations of a community that has faced unprecedented
change in recent years have also played an important role.
East London has long been home for groups of immigrants arriving in Britain,
but the ethnic minorities are not evenly spread. The Isle of Dogs remains a
predominantly white area of Tower Hamlets - 80 per cent of the population of
the Millwall ward, where the by-election took place, are white with
traditional working-class roots. Until the 1970s, the London docks continued
to provide well-paid mass employment; many families both lived and worked in
the area, with dock jobs passing from father to son.
In recent years, an increasing number of ethnic-minority families have
arrived on the council estates. Concerns over housing undoubtedly played a
big part in the by-election; some white residents complain that Asian
families receive preferential treatment in the allocation of accommodation.
Local authorities must give priority to homeless people, and Asian families
have moved in on this basis. The irony is that many Asians would much rather
not live there. They complain of feeling abandoned - away from the ethnic
shops, community associations and places of worship in other parts of the
borough. Since the BNP began concentrating its efforts on the area, they
feel intimidated as well.
But the isle's population has felt embittered for much longer than this.
When the docks closed, the Thatcher government responded by establishing the
London Docklands Development Corporation, with a mandate to turn the island
and surrounding area into the largest development site in Europe. Local
people were hostile, believing that there would be high-quality jobs for
skilled outsiders and a minimal number of low-grade ones for locals. Canary
Wharf came to symbolise feelings of anger and insecurity over the way
Docklands was being redeveloped, and the stalling of the entire project has
left a deep mood of cynicism.
Mr Ted Johns, a veteran Labour councillor and community leader, has lived on
the Isle of Dogs all his life. He thinks that local feelings about the LDDC
are crucial to understanding how the island's politics have developed.
'We are fond of the image of the East End as a racial melting pot,' he says,
'but minority groups have always had to struggle for acceptance against
racists. But I think there is a wider explanation for the result than that.'
Mr Johns' wider explanation draws together many strands of the old London
docks' recent history. When the government produced its vision for the new
Docklands, it took responsibility away from local authorities and gave it -
and funding - to the unelected development corporation.
People suffering from loss of jobs and the collapse of their community felt
deeply that they had no proper input to decision-making.
Mr Johns says: 'To a large extent being a councillor is like being a cypher
these days. All the important decisions are taken elsewhere.
'I think the election of the BNP is the worst day in the history of the Isle
of Dogs. But the ability of councillors to respond to people's problems is
now so constrained, it is not surprising if some voters start listening to
the promises of extremists.'

FT  18 SEP 93 / Scheme to finish Dockland properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW SCHEME to rescue bankrupt properties in London's docklands has been
announced following the news that the largest collapse, Canary Wharf, may
come out of administrative receivership at the end of October.
Investment advisory group Matrix Securities is to try and capitalise on
renewed interest by investors - due to a possible underground extension and
a proposed Pounds 1.1bn bank rescue package - with the launch of a Pounds
95m trust.
The Matrix South Quay trust plans to finish developing three buildings
opposite Canary Wharf by using enterprise zone tax concessions - available
for buildings started before the area's enterprise zone status ended in
1992.
Investors will be able to subscribe for units in the trust by providing
Pounds 325 for each Pounds 1,000 invested. The balance of Pounds 675 will be
provided by Hill Samuel, the merchant banking arm of TSB in the form of a
loan. Matrix says that a 40 per cent tax payer should receive a tax break of
Pounds 395 for each Pounds 1,000 invested, which means a paper profit of
Pounds 67. The minimum investment is Pounds 25,000.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Keating gives pro-independence speech to mark Australia
House anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, said yesterday that most
Britons would find it 'unexceptional and inoffensive' for Australia to sever
its links with the British monarchy and become a republic, write Alexander
Nicoll and Ivor Owen.
In a speech marking the 75th anniversary of Australia House, the country's
High Commission in London, Mr Keating sought to portray an Australian change
to a republic as a normal step for a nation forging a new identity in the
Asia-Pacific region.
Mr Keating discussed the issue over lunch with Mr John Major, UK prime
minister, who said afterwards that he would not be involved in advising
Queen Elizabeth II on the ending of her role as Australia's head of state.
It was a matter for the Queen and Australia's ministers and people, Mr Major
said.
The two premiers emphasised the warmth of relations between the two
countries.
Britain's tabloid press has interpreted the republican moves as an attack on
the Queen and has sprung to her defence, portraying Mr Keating as a rude
publicity-seeker. But he is expected to receive a warm welcome when he
visits Balmoral in Scotland today for private discussions with her.
Asked why he thought British people would support the Australian bid for a
republic, Mr Keating said a constitution democratically chosen would always
have the respect of a democratic people.
'So I do not think it is a matter of trying to put a dipstick into British
opinions, but rather looking at Britain's long-running respect for
democratic process and practices,' he said.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Size does matter, say New Delhi bureaucrats: Plans to
smother soft-drink bottles in red tape anger international bottlers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN bureaucracy, famous for its ability to wrap a sub-continent in
red tape, has turned its attention to the Coca-Cola bottle.
The ministry of civil supplies, consumer affairs and public distribution -
apparently oblivious to the efforts of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao to
liberalise the economy - has thought it fit to try to regulate the size of
soft-drink bottles.
The ministry argues that with India opening its economy, new companies,
including the US group Coca-Cola, will flood the market with bottles in all
shapes and sizes. The Indian consumer would then become thoroughly confused
and be cheated by small bottles pretending to be bigger than they really
were.
Since nearly half the population cannot read, labels stating the size of a
container offer consumers too little protection. 'Our country is different
from other countries,' says Mr N S Pangtey, a deputy director at the
ministry. 'Our masses are illiterate.'
Executives at the Indian affiliate of Coca-Cola are incensed at the
ministry's move. The company said that elsewhere in the world even
illiterate consumers quickly learned to distinguish between bottles.
Of the 195 countries in which Coca-Cola operates, only India is planning to
restrict competition by controlling bottle sizes. 'This is against the whole
process of liberalisation. The consumers should be free to decide what sizes
of bottles they prefer,' the company said.
Many countries standardise container sizes - so that consumers are not
fooled by a 195ml bottle masquerading as one of 200ml.
But the ministry of civil supplies is proposing to ban whole size ranges.
Soft-drink bottlers would be permitted to use only 250ml, 500ml, 700ml and
one-litre bottles, plus some larger sizes.
Bottles of 200ml and 300ml would be banned if the ministry's proposals are
approved by the government, even though bottles in these sizes have long
been sold in India.
The ministry also proposes to regiment the sizes of containers for a whole
range of other packaged drinks and foods, including bottled fruit juices.
However, for fruit juices 200ml and 300ml bottles would be allowed, but not
the 250ml to which soft-drink bottlers would be limited.
Mr Pangtey cannot explain this discrepancy expect by saying it was a
decision of the standing expert committee of weights and measures.

FT  18 SEP 93 / US urges China not to test bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is urging China not to conduct an underground nuclear explosion which
would break a year-old worldwide moratorium on nuclear testing.
US intelligence reports suggest China is preparing for an explosion at its
Lop Nor test site.
President Bill Clinton yesterday said China should 'step away' from any
plans to test a nuclear bomb. The US president earlier this year extended
the moratorium on US testing. This effectively precludes any British tests
which use the US Nevada test site. Russia is not expected to resume testing,
and France, which would like to conduct tests, appears likely to refrain so
long as only China among the nuclear powers is testing.
Diplomats have speculated China would delay any resumption of nuclear
testing until after the decision next Thursday on the location of the
Olympic Games in the year 2000, to avoid damaging Beijing's chances.
Yesterday China's top Olympic official ruled out a 1996 Games boycott but
refused to say that Chinese athletes would actually go to Atlanta.
Earlier the chief executive of the Beijing bid committee, Zhang Baifa, said
a boycott was possible because of political interference by the US House of
Representatives, which passed a resolution in July opposing China's bid on
human rights grounds.
Zhang stressed that this was a personal opinion he first expressed last
month. But He Zhenliang, vice president of the International Olympic
Committee (IOC), dismissed the apparent boycott threat as 'unfortunate
rumours' based on an erroneous interpretation of a statement. 'There will be
no boycott,' he said categorically. Boycott is a non-question.'
President Bill Clinton yesterday told Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime
minister, that the US would like to see a political initiative to stop the
violence in Somalia, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Clinton said he could not provide details of a possible settlement
because 'our position is not well enough formed yet .' But he said 'it
certainly doesn't mean more troops there.'

FT  18 SEP 93 / Sun still shines for big bucks tourism: Damian Fraser finds
Florida little shaken by murders among holiday-makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MURDER of nine foreign visitors in a year is the stuff of public
relations nightmares for every tourist destination. Florida reached that
unenviable record on Tuesday, with the killing of the British holiday-maker
Mr Gary Colley. It is waiting anxiously for the full impact on its premier
industry.
Florida is the world's most popular tourist spot, having overtaken
California last year. A little more than 41m tourists - about 36m Americans
and 7m foreigners - came to the Sunshine State last year, some 2 per cent
more than the year before.
Tourism is also Florida's largest industry. Tourist spending was Dollars
31bn (Pounds 20.1bn) last year, or 22 per cent of the total in the state.
Florida authorities are the first to admit the negative publicity from the
killings will have some short-term impact. Mr Greg Farmer, commerce
secretary, says the industry might suffer a 15-25 per cent decline this
year. Of particular concern is the booming convention business, which
received 680,000 delegates last year. 'They look for safety,' says Mr
Crotts, 'and the perception is Florida is not safe'.
Travel agents expected the biggest impact in the overseas market, the
fastest-growing segment of the tourist industry. They spoke of the immediate
reduction in bookings from German-speaking countries, and expected the UK
tabloid newspaper coverage of the murder of Mr Colley to have its effect on
the UK market. With more than 1m tourists to Florida annually, the UK sends
the largest number of its citizens to the state after Canada.
The immediate problem is not cancellations. These are unlikely just now,
given the deposits tourists pay, but the winter season, for which bookings
are now being made, is another matter.
The overseas tourists will be further put off by the appreciation of the
dollar against European currencies. The Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta) expects growth of UK tourism to Florida to slow to single digits per
cent this year, from 22 per cent growth last year.
But the Abta doubts there will be a decline of UK tourism, since most
would-be tourists realise that the odds against them being subject to a
crime remain long.
Local economists likewise doubt the impact of recent murders will be
'catastrophic', as Mr Farmer put it. Florida has enormous advantages -
winter sun, beaches, the world's best theme parks in Orlando, and a huge
amount of repeat business from Americans with homes or relatives in the
state.
Florida has established a critical mass of highly competitive tourist
services that offer some of the cheapest and best-value accommodation in the
world.
The state boasts varied attractions. Miami, notwithstanding all its dangers,
has become a commercial hub of the Americas, with companies such as AT&amp;T and
General Motors setting up regional Latin American headquarters in the city.
Orlando brings in mainly US tourists, though Europeans are catching up
quickly (growing by 32 per cent last year). Much safer than Miami, Orlando
attracts families and increasingly businessmen at conventions.
As the state's most important industry, tourism enjoys privileges. Hundreds
of murders of locals barely raise an eyebrow in the state but the killing of
Mr Colley and, last week, that of the German Mr Uwe-Wilhelm Rakebrand, set
off a massive campaign to promote tourist safety, including 24-hour patrols
of highway rest areas, plain-clothes police searching for lost tourists, and
free telephone advice to tourists.
Fear is not yet deterring investors. This week, Universal Studios voted with
its cheque book on the future of Florida's tourism industry by announcing an
estimated Dollars 3bn expansion in Orlando, including a Jurassic Park theme
park, hotels, a convention centre and golf courses.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Four Japan reform bills get go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S coalition government yesterday approved four bills to overhaul the
country's scandal-prone political system, setting the scene for a
parliamentary battle with the opposition Liberal Democratic party.
The coalition has promised that the bills will become law by the end of the
year, meaning that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, will need
to secure their passage during a 90-day extraordinary parliamentary session
which began yesterday.
Mr Hosokawa's proposals will be challenged by Mr Yohei Kono, who is certain
to remain as LDP president after the position was declared open to
challengers yesterday. The only potential challenger, Mr Michio Watanabe,
the former foreign minister, has decided not to stand.
'I will be a strong opposition leader,' said Mr Kono, who was chosen as
president after the LDP lost its parliamentary majority at a general
election in July.
His party will force prolonged debate on the four bills, which include
replacing the present multi-seat constituencies with a mix of single seats
and proportional representation.
Under the coalition proposal, the 511 seats in the lower house, the more
powerful of Japan's two houses, will be replaced by a 500-seat system, with
250 representatives chosen from single seats and 250 from a separate vote
for proportional representation candidates.
The bills include restrictions on donations by companies to individual
politicians and their support groups, while a central election fund of about
Y41.4bn (Pounds 253.9m) would be established to subsidise parties and reduce
their dependence on donations, seen as the cause of most corruption.
But doubt remains about the seven-party coalition's commitment to reform, as
some members of the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist
party, argue that the changes will benefit the LDP, which remains the
largest single party.
The SDP's position will be influenced by the outcome of an election
beginning today for a new leader to replace Mr Sadao Yamahana, who resigned
to take responsibility for the party's poor performance at the July
election.
One candidate, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, will continue support for the
coalition's policies, while a far left-wing candidate, Mr Masatoshi Ito,
opposes the electoral system bills.
Divisions within the SDP highlight the fragility of the coalition, which has
indicated that an election will be called after the electoral reforms are
implemented.
There is also a dispute between Mr Hosokawa and the Japan Renewal party, a
coalition member, which has suggested that an election should be called
later this year even if the bills are not passed.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new government is bracing itself for a rise in unemployment as
structural changes in the country's economy lead to drastic corporate
restructuring and redundancies.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, yesterday
warned that lay-offs and corporate restructuring were inevitable, and that
Japan would undergo 'painful times' for which there was 'no quick panacea'.
So far, Japanese companies have coped with the downturn in the economy by
cutting labour costs through staff relocation, lending employment to other
companies, and temporary lay-offs. The country's bureaucrats have denied the
possibility of wide-spread redundancies because companies fear a labour
shortage when the economy recovers.
Unemployment has been contained at 2.5 per cent. However, companies face
high levels of 'in-house unemployment', bearing the overhead burden for
staff who have nothing to do. 'Real unemployment would be substantially
higher than 2.5 per cent if such staff were considered,' said Mr Kumagai.
Large companies are now starting to drop such employees. Last month, Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, the telecom company, announced it would cut about
10,000 employees through voluntary retirement by the end of next year.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel-maker, said it was about to reduce
the number of administrative staff in its steel division.
William Dawkins adds: Further evidence of Japanese consumers' cautious mood
emerged yesterday, with Tokyo department stores reporting falling sales in
August for the 18th month in a row.
Last month's sales fell by 6.6 per cent from those of August 1992, said the
Japan Department Stores Association. It attributed the decline to an
unusually wet summer which, combined with the yen's continued rise, has
pulled Japan close to recession.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Two senators in trouble not to run for re-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US PARTY managers are relieved at the decisions of Senator Dave Durenberger,
a Minnesota Republican, and Senator Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat,
not to seek re-election next year.
Each man won 56 per cent support in his last election, in 1988, but both
have been tainted by financial scandal. They were likely to be challenged in
their own parties and neither was given much chance for next November.
These early retirements are causing analysts to rethink their calculations
on the prospects for both parties in 1994.
The Democratic majority in the Senate is 56:44. Of the 34 senators whose
terms are to expire in January 1995, 21 are Democrats and only 13
Republicans, giving the opposition a sporting chance of winning back control
of the Senate, lost in 1986.
Besides Mr Durenberger, two other Republican senators have announced their
intention to retire: Mr Jack Danforth of Missouri, whose seat is thought
likely to go to former Governor John Ashcroft, and Mr Malcolm Wallop of
Wyoming, whose departure clears the way for Mr Dick Cheney, President George
Bush's defence secretary, or Mrs Lynne Cheney, his wife, to return to
Washington.
On the Democratic side, Mr Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio is retiring, opening a
race expected to be fierce.

FT  18 SEP 93 / PLO intends to open office in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday it was planning to open
an office in Washington as soon as the US lifted its formal ban on contacts
with the organisation.
Mr Saeb Erekat, deputy head of the Palestinian negotiating team at the
Washington talks on the Middle East, said in Amman that he expected the US
would announce an end to the ban in about three weeks. The PLO mission would
not have diplomatic status but would fulfil a political role, said Mr
Erekat.
Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, said on his return to Tunis, a week after
the signing in Washington of the outline of an interim peace agreement with
Israel, that Palestinians should now consider US President Bill Clinton a
friend.
PLO officials are anxious to build quickly on the new relationship with the
US, in order to facilitate economic aid for the occupied territories and to
assist in the difficult negotiations with Israel that lie ahead.
Opponents of the Israeli-PLO agreement yesterday stepped up efforts to
marshal opposition to the deal. Leaders of Hamas, the radical Islamic
faction operating in Gaza and the West Bank, went to Damascus for talks with
Syrian officials and other Palestinian factions.
Hamas has agreed a truce with the PLO in the occupied territories but it
believes that Mr Arafat has betrayed the Palestinians. It has pledged to
continue the armed struggle against the continued presence of Israeli
troops. Hamas leaders are also looking for support from Syria, which remains
sceptical about the PLO-Israel accord but sent a representative to the
signing ceremony.
If Syria were also to reach an agreement with Israel, that would represent a
blow to Hamas - even more so to Hizbollah, the radical Shia Lebanese
organisation which is fighting to end the Israeli presence in south Lebanon.
Syria is the main conduit by which arms and financial support from Iran
reach Hizbollah.

MR Paul Oguma was nominated as governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria
yesterday, in the latest key official posting by the interim government.
It is unclear whether the appointment will survive the government, which is
due to stand down next March.
Mr Oguma succeeds Mr Abdulkadir Ahmed, who had held the post for more than a
decade, during which time there were steep devaluations of the naira,
balance of payments crises and uncontrolled public spending.
Mr Oguma has held two previous banking appointments - as managing director
of two of the top commercial banks, Union Bank of Nigeria and United Bank
for Africa - before he recently set up a consultancy. He is thought to
favour free market policies, but inherits an inefficient foreign exchange
system and insufficient money supply controls.

THE US is stepping up its pressure on the central Asian republics for
improvements in human rights, with a warning that aid will be tied to their
records in this area.
Mr Strobe Talbott, US ambassador-at-large with responsibility for the new
states of the former Soviet Union, cut short a visit to Turkmenistan this
week in protest at the imprisonment of four rights activists, and had a
'long and frank conversation' on rights in Uzbekistan.
Mr Mike McCurry, state department spokesman, said the early departure was a
'strong diplomatic protest'.
State Department officials denied that Mr Talbott had put off signing aid
agreements with the two countries because of human rights abuses, but said
that compliance with international human rights obligations would be 'a
factor in our aid decisions'.
US aid programmes amount to Dollars 73m (Pounds 47.4m) for Turkmenistan and
to Dollars 17m for Uzbekistan. For the coming year, US aid to the former
Soviet Union is under consideration in Congress, where some members have
shown an inclination to shift funds away from Russia, the principal
beneficiary so far, and towards the smaller republics. Congress has in the
past placed conditions on the provision of aid to the region.

Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday survived a mutiny
from his elite army corps when soldiers lifted their eight-day blockade of
Banja Luka, the biggest Serb-controlled city in northern Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic appears to have smashed the rebellion, dubbed 'September 93', by
arresting some of its leaders and winning over others. But the protest
reflects growing splits between the Belgrade leadership of President
Slobodan Milosevic and Serb leaders from outside Serbia proper.
There are growing fears the parlous state of the economy will give rise to
similar protests in coming months, even though the Serbs have effectively
won the war in Bosnia.
One reason is that Banja Luka, the north-western Serb military headquarters
and the industrial centre of the self-proclaimed Serb state in Bosnia, has
been much harder hit by the war than many other regions nearer Belgrade.
The soldiers who rebelled receive the equivalent of DM2 (80 pence) a month -
a fraction of what others earn.
The mutiny appeared to be an attempt to weaken Mr Karadzic, who has emerged
from recent peace negotiations in a strong position.
But there is continuing confusion about who instigated the affair. Mr
Vojislav Seselj, president of the powerful, ultra-nationalist Serbian
Radical party, blames the Communist Party-Movement for Yugoslavia led by Mr
Milosevic's wife, Mrs Mirjana Markovic.
In the first sign of the expected power struggle between Serbia's two
strongest leaders, Mr Seselj has accused Mr Milosevic's closest allies of
'trying to separate Serbia from Serbs living in Bosnia and Croatia'.

FT  18 SEP 93 / 'Rat-catchers' rattle the establishment: Increasing concern
as the right gains ground in Hamburg's city elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'DON'T LET the brown rat-catchers into the Rathaus,' Hamburg's popular
Morgenpost newspaper shouted in its front-page headline yesterday. 'They
want to take our taxes.'
It was quoting a colourful image coined by Mr Henning Voscherau, the city
mayor. The rat-catchers are the extreme right-wing parties seeking to
mobilise the growing fears of German citizens over immigration, law and
order, a European currency, and the rising costs of unification. Nazi
brownshirts once exploited the same sort of xenophobia.
The Rathaus is Hamburg's city hall, the seat of the city parliament, which
is up for election tomorrow with the result still wide open. All the main
political parties look set to lose support.
As for the literary context, it is a reference to that famous rat-catcher of
Hamlin, the pied piper, who enticed the town's children to a never-never
land with his magical music.
After weeks of trying to ignore the menace of a right-wing extremist vote in
the election, the German media are finally taking the threat seriously.
And the prospect of either or both of Germany's radical right-wing parties -
the Republicans or the German People's Union (DVU) - winning a handful of
seats in the parliament has got the entire political establishment rattled.
Hamburg is seen as setting the trend for no fewer than 19 national, state
and local elections in the next year.
The police are preparing for violent clashes tomorrow night, with extreme
left-wing, anti-fascist groups organising a rally at the central station,
just when the two right-wing leaders - Mr Fritz Schonhuber of the
Republicans and Mr Erich Frey, the millionaire publisher behind the DVU -
will be turning up in the Rathaus square. Whether they win seats or not,
they seem certain of close attention.
The city of Hamburg, based on its great international port, was a centre of
anti-Nazism even at the height of Hitler's power.
His party never won a democratic majority there when it swept the rest of
the country in the 1930s.
For Mr Voscherau, the Social Democrat mayor seeking re-election, his highest
priority is no longer winning an absolute majority for his SPD, but stopping
the right-wingers from gaining the 4 per cent they need to creep into the
Rat-haus.
'I beg all the citizens of Hamburg to go to the polls on Sunday and decide
democratically,' he urged a sad little rally in the rain on Thursday night
on the banks of Hamburg's Alster Lake. 'Don't follow the rat-catchers of the
right.'
Perhaps it was the weather rather than the political mood which kept the
numbers down, but Mr Voscherau's party seems certain to lose its absolute
majority for only the third time in 46 years, in the face of growing
political apathy and cynicism in the electorate at large.
At the same time, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
 -the ruling party in Bonn but the opposition in Hamburg - looks to be in an
even worse state. Mr Kohl pulled in an invited audience of 2,500 at the
Hamburg International Trade Centre for his rally on Thursday night, but his
speech was lacklustre and low-key, and the party seems to accept that it is
condemned to a poor second place.
The last opinion poll by the Infas opinion research institute put the SPD on
40 per cent, compared with 48 per cent at city elections two years ago, and
the CDU down to 31 per cent from 35 per cent. The other main Bonn party, the
minority Free Democrats (FDP) in the ruling coalition, is on only 4 per
cent, and may win no seats at all.
Only the Greens look set to make big gains, in what is both a protest vote
and an indication that they are now seen as part of the political
establishment: they are up in the polls from 7.2 to 11 per cent.
As for the right-wingers, both parties are bumping along at 4 per cent
support, together with the Statt Partei - a citizens' alliance without
programme or policy except a rejection of the party establishments.
What is most worrying for all the main parties, however, is the level of
those who don't know or won't say: 25 per cent have not yet decided, and 17
per cent refuse to say whom they would support. The latter could well be
tempted by the far right.
'There is a popular anger about, which we absolutely have to tackle before
the federal elections next year,' Mr Voscherau says.
'We need more social justice, straight-talking, morality and decency from
the political parties . . . we need to take radical action to ensure the
protection of life and limb, of property and the sense of security of the
small people in society.
'It is that anger which is giving the right-wingers the feeling that they
are getting the upper hand.'
But as for Mr Voscherau's unfortunate image of the rat-catcher, he seems to
have forgotten that it was the incompetence and miserliness of the Hamlin
town council which caused the pied piper to play a different tune.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Bosnia peace on Tuesday, says Owen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD OWEN, the international mediator, yesterday gave his strongest
indication to date that a peace agreement could be close in Bosnia, when he
said he expected the three warring sides to sign a deal when they meet in
Sarajevo on Tuesday.
Speaking in Macedonia on an intense round of diplomatic lobbying, Lord Owen
said: 'I expect that the agreement will be signed on Tuesday. It will be a
very difficult agreement, but it must be signed.'
The accord that the three sides have been asked to 'consider signing' on
Tuesday proposes a loose 'union' of three ethnic mini-states, with
provisions for the states to secede at a later date.
With many of the territorial issues still apparently unresolved, the tactics
of the mediators now appear to be to press for an outline peace settlement,
hoping that the final boundary details can be worked out at a later date.
But, as an indicator of the problems that will dog any deal, Mr Alija
Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, reiterated that he will not sign a deal
without further territorial concessions.
The latest round of peace talks broke down three weeks ago, when Serb and
Croat leaders refused the Bosnian government's demand for an extra 4 per
cent of territory, on top of the 28 per cent which the agreement now offers
them.
Although the commanders of the Moslem and Croat forces in Bosnia yesterday
agreed to a ceasefire, due to take effect at 10 am GMT today, fierce
fighting between Moslem and Croat forces was reported to be continuing in
central Bosnia, around the cities of Mostar and Vitez.
By way of a separate blow to the peace process, Serb forces were also
reported to have shelled Knin, in the Serb-controlled Krajina enclave, in
Croatia.

THE last Russian soldiers on Polish soil are due to leave this morning, a
day before Poles chose a new parliament in the country's fourth national
election since the communists relinquished power in 1989.
In a ceremony at his official residence in Warsaw's Belweder Palace
yesterday, President Lech Walesa bade farewell to representatives of the
Russian contingent which had, at its peak, numbered 64,000.
Poland will thus be free this weekend of foreign troops for the first time
since 1939. Hours before the ceremony, on the 54th anniversary of the Red
Army's invasion of Poland, Mr Walesa attended the funeral in Krakow of
General Wladyslaw Sikorski, the country's wartime leader. Gen Sikorski was
killed, in exile, in an aircraft crash in Gibraltar in 1943 and buried in
Newark in the UK. It was his last wish to be buried in a Poland free of
foreign domination. The day, replete with symbolism, was marred by the
cancellation of a visit on health grounds by General Pavel Grachev, the
Russian defence minister.
His decision followed warnings in the Russian parliament that President
Boris Yeltsin's recent statement removing Russian objections to Polish Nato
membership was premature.
Poland has used Mr Yeltsin's statement to press Nato for a declaration of
intent on future Polish, Czech, Slovak and Hungarian membership.
A survey carried yesterday in the Super Express newspaper in violation of a
ban on publication of poll results 12 days before the election, predicts the
farmers' PSL party will top tomorrow's ballot with a 20 per cent share. The
poll puts the former communist SLD movement in second place with a 16 per
cent share, leaving the Solidarity-based UD party in third place, with 13.5
per cent of the ballot.
The poll suggests that only six parties will enter parliament while the free
market KLD group, which has held posts such as the privatisation ministry
will fail to reach the 5 per cent of the ballot limit needed to enter
parliament.

MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday survived a mutiny
from his elite army corps when soldiers lifted their blockade of Banja Luka,
the biggest Serb-controlled city in northern Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic appears to have smashed the rebellion, dubbed 'September 93', by
arresting some of its leaders and winning over others. But the protest
reflects the growing splits between the Belgrade leadership of President
Slobodan Milosevic and Serb leaders from outside Serbia proper.
Yesterday, after securing pledges of improved living conditions the corps,
made up of Bosnian Serb soldiers, abandoned their eight-day protest, and
withdrew tanks and anti-aircraft guns. But with the Serb economy in a state
of near collapse, fears are growing in Belgrade that similar protests could
be repeated in the coming months.
One reason is that Banja Luka, the northwestern Serb military headquarters
and the industrial centre of the self-proclaimed Serb state, has been much
harder hit by the war than many other regions nearer to Belgrade.
The soldiers who rebelled receive the equivalent of a mere two DM2 (80
pence) a month - a fraction of what the new Serb traders who have sprung up
in the region are earning.
Captain Bilak, a leader of the rebels' crisis committee, yesterday accused
'spies of trying to hijack their protest' which, he said, was prompted by
economic rather than political aims.
'During recent days we noticed people planted among us who were very
dangerous for our state and our president, Dr Radovan Karadzic. But we
spotted them in time,' he said showing his loyalty to the current
leadership.
But Mr Nenad Zafirovic, a journalist at Belgrade independent radio B-92
yesterday said that resentment appears to be growing about Banja Luka's lack
of control over the political agenda, largely in the hands of Mr Karadzic.
'The Banja Luka corps has also provided the bulk of the manpower for
Bosnia's Serb army,' Mr Zafirovic said.
The mutiny appeared to be an attempt to weaken Mr Karadzic, who has emerged
from recent peace negotiations in a strong position. He managed to overrule
the objections of his commander, General Ratko Mladic, and hand over a small
amount of Serb-held territory to Bosnia's president Alija Izetbegovic for
the proposed mostly Moslem republic.
There is continuing confusion about who instigated what is seen by some as
an attempted coup. Mr Vojislav Seselj, president of the powerful,
ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, denies his involvement. He blames
the Communist Party-Movement for Yugoslavia which is led by Mr Milosevic's
wife, Mrs Mirjana Markovic.
In the first sign of the expected power struggle between Serbia's two
strongest leaders, Mr Seselj threatened to call a no-confidence vote in Mr
Milosevic's Belgrade government. Mr Seselj accused Mr Milosevic's closest
allies of 'trying to separate Serbia from Serbs living in Bosnia and
Croatia'.
Mr Milosevic seems increasingly keen to broker a peace settlement in the
hope of lifting UN sanctions. Yesterday international mediators Lord Owen
and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg arrived in Belgrade in an effort to win his
endorsement, ahead of the proposed signing of the peace plan on Tuesday.
As the mediators shuttled between the different political groups, the
leaders of the three communities appear to be moving closer to signing a
peace package. But Mr Izetbegovic insists that his landlocked republic must
get more land from Serb and Croat leaders before he signs any deal. Bosnian
and Croat commanders yesterday formally agreed to implement a ceasefire in
central and southern Bosnia, which, according to the agreement signed by
their leaders in Geneva earlier this week, should take effect today.
But as a sign of tension that could wreck the deal, fighting continued
between Moslem and Croat forces in central Bosnia, with fierce clashes
around Vitez and Mostar.

FT  18 SEP 93 / EC's plan for milk subsidy cut likely to turn sour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission, no stranger to controversy, is set to walk into a
storm of hostility when it proposes next week to cut sharply an expensive
subsidy on milk for 31m EC schoolchildren.
There is still some dispute about the size of the proposed cut. But it is
likely that Brussels will be lined up in popular demonology with the likes
of former UK prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher - who as education
secretary in the early 1970s earned the sobriquet of 'milk-snatcher' for
cutting free school milk - especially as Britain's current Conservative
government is unhappy about the measure.
The cut will be debated by EC agriculture ministers on Tuesday. According to
UK officials the Commission is proposing to halve the subsidy, risking the
continuity of a scheme taken up by local authorities across Europe,
particularly in the UK.
Only the Dutch are happy to sanction the cut, with France prepared to
consider it. Germany and the Mediterranean countries are determined the
subsidy will not be touched. The UK is somewhere in the middle, wanting both
savings for the EC budget and to avoid bad publicity.
Last year the EC laid out Ecu236m (Pounds 180.77m) on the subsidy, according
to figures from the Commission, which originally proposed to cut outlays
back to Ecu109m by next year. Officials now say the cut will be
significantly less, to Ecu176m. Across the EC, 143,000 schools get the
subsidy for 31m children; in the UK 31,000 schools with some 8m children
receive it.
The subsidy was originally financed through the revenue from penalties
levied on milk producers for exceeding the production quotas fixed by the
EC. These levies were abolished by last year's reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP), under which Ecu4.4bn was spent on the dairy
sector in 1992.
With the CAP budget now strained to its near-Ecu36bn limit, the Commission
and the EC are looking for cuts, especially as bills mount to buy off
producer interests unhappy with the production, export and price cuts
required by the CAP reform and as part of the Uruguay Round trade talks.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Russia may ban internal use of dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government plans to introduce a package of economic reforms,
including banning the use of the dollar within the country, as part of a
drive to pull the country back from the brink of hyperinflation and again
make it eligible for sustained western assistance.
The measures are being finalised as Mr Yegor Gaidar, the radical economist
who was acting prime minister until last December, rejoins the government in
the role of first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy.
His acceptance of the job was conditional on the removal of Mr Oleg Lobov
from the post of first deputy prime minister. Mr Lobov may be 'promoted' to
the influential secretaryship of the Security Council.
The banning of the use of foreign currency, widely used, has been proposed
several times in the past year but always delayed because of Russians'
preference for hard currency as a stable unit of value.
A steep slide in the rouble abated two months ago, and its current worth is
Rbs1,025 to the dollar. But because of inflation, the purchasing power of
the rouble falls by 20-30 per cent a month.
The government could stop the right of Russians as well as foreigners to
hold dollar bank accounts, as well as forbid its use in retail outlets.
However, such a move would be extremely difficult to police and would be
evaded.
The measures, probably to be introduced in a series of decrees, will also
include:
Raising value added tax on a range of goods by 7 percentage points from a
current average of 15 per cent. Proceeds would go into a fund to support the
energy industries.
Increasing marginal rates of income tax on all salaries over Rbs12m (Dollars
12,000) to 50 per cent from a flat rate of around 30 per cent.
Raising import duties on cars and other goods.
Further restriction of credits to industries, except for special cases.
A tough review of capital investment programmes.
Postponing interest payments on government debt to the central bank until
1997.
Cutting imports of raw materials by 30 per cent.
The package, constructed by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier in charge
of finance, would, if carried through, pit the government directly against
the powerful agricultural and industrial lobbies whose interests are in
continuing subsidies and soft credits.
The government, harried by foreign countries to which it is vastly indebted,
has decided to try again for macroeconomic discipline, with the lustre of Mr
Gaidar's name giving the project credibility.
Mr Gaidar will face an all but impossible task - with a budget deficit
plunging beyond 10 per cent of the gross domestic product, a hostile
parliament and a potentially difficult relationship with Mr Fyodorov, who
has been in charge of economic reform.

FT  18 SEP 93 / French economy stabilises
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH economic activity stabilised in the second quarter of this year, with
gross domestic product showing a zero rate of growth, according to figures
released yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office.
The Economy Ministry said they showed the economy had bottomed out after
sharp contractions in the final quarter of 1992 and the first three months
of this year.
But private sector economists expressed caution about the statistics. 'This
doesn't mean that the recession is over,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier,
economist at Salomon Brothers. Like other economists he said GDP growth
would probably fall again in the third quarter because of weakening consumer
spending.
Consumer expenditure was one of the factors which lifted the second quarter
results, increasing by 0.4 per cent over the previous three months after a
fall of 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.
The increase, which included a 7 per cent rise in spending on cars is,
however, expected to be offset in the July-September period by the effect of
increased taxes. The Contribution Sociale Generalisee, a tax on all income,
and levies on petrol and alcohol, have all been raised since July.
Industrial output also reversed its decline in the second quarter, rising by
0.2 per cent after a contraction of 1.8 per cent in the January-March
period. But investment fell for the eighth successive quarter, declining by
1.2 per cent.
Economists said the second quarter figures needed to be interpreted with
care. Using the measure of market sector GDP, which excludes state services
and more widely used in France until now, economic activity contracted 0.1
per cent in the first quarter.
Insee maintained its forecast that GDP would fall by 0.7 per cent for the
year as a whole. The consensus among private sector economists is a decline
of about 1 per cent.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Ashdown orders inquiry into 'racism' allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of all the main political parties yesterday condemned the local
by-election victory of the far-right British National party.
But Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, was forced on to the
defensive by Labour accusations that his party had issued racist leaflets
during the by-election campaign in Tower Hamlets, east London. He announced
an inquiry into the activities of local party members.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he hoped the BNP's first-ever
council success would not be repeated. 'I think it was an unfortunate result
and I want to make it clear that there is no place in our society for these
sort of policies,' he said.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the outcome represented 'a
deeply depressing day for democracy'.
In a strongly worded statement, the archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George
Carey, denounced racist policies as evil and emphasised: 'Christian people
should condemn and resist racism by all lawful means.'
The victory for Mr Derek Beackon, who won Millwall ward from Labour by seven
votes, has raised fears that the racial tensions that formed the backdrop to
the by-election campaign might erupt into violence again.
In a letter to the leaders of the Liberal Democrat group that runs Tower
Hamlets council, Mr Ashdown expressed grave concern yesterday that one of
the party leaflets 'could lend itself to a racist interpretation'.
He insisted that racism had no place in the Liberal Democrat party, and
emphasised that any party member who was proved to have acted in a racist
way would immediately be expelled.
The need for an investigation into the activities of Liberal Democrats is
particularly embarrassing for the party, which holds its annual conference
in Torquay next week. But party managers hope that by acting promptly they
will have succeeded in containing the setback.
Mr Jonathan Matthews, secretary of the Liberal Democrats' Tower Hamlets
branch, said local party members would go along with the investigation, but
vehemently denied that they were racist. 'We have a lot of Bangladeshi
members,' he said.
'We fought an extremely strong campaign and a very, very straight one. There
wasn't the slightest hint of trying to take advantage of any racial
tension.'
The immediate concern in Tower Hamlets is whether the BNP victory will lead
to an increase in the level of racially motivated violence on the streets.
Tomorrow the Bangladeshi Welfare Association has invited local MPs,
councillors and religious leaders to a meeting to protest against racial
attacks.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Minimum pension may be scrapped: Proposals part of
government campaign to reduce state benefits and ease private sector's
involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to scrap the Guaranteed Minimum Pension, which helps protect the
value of millions of occupational pensions against inflation, are being
considered by the government.
The move is being examined as part of the government's desire to roll back
state-provided benefits and to make it easier for the private sector to fill
the gap.
Whitehall officials have been meeting pensions industry experts over the
past few months to discuss possible replacements.
Employers are currently required to provide a Guaranteed Minimum Pension
(GMP) for workers who choose to contract out of the State Earnings Related
Pension Scheme (Serps). These guaranteed pensions rise by three per cent a
year to protect pensioners against inflation.
Although many pensioners in occupational schemes receive more than the GMP,
the system provides a floor as well as a mechanism which ensures most
schemes uprate benefits annually.
GMP acts as a safety net for pensioners whose scheme assets fail to provide
enough to cover their promised benefits. It ensures that they at least
receive the minimum amount guaranteed by the original 1978 legislation which
established the state pensions scheme.
Without these rules Maxwell company pensioners might have been left
penniless.
The pensions industry has argued that GMP, introduced before most
occupational pensions offered inflation-linked increases, is no longer
needed to protect pensioners' interests. It is also, they say, an
administrative nightmare.
If the government were to stop GMP entirely it would be attacking a
cornerstone of old-age provision in the UK.
Shifting responsibilities from the state to individuals or to employers is
one of the most controversial elements in the government's longer-term
efforts to cut the rising social security budget.
Employers whose schemes contract out of Serps earn rebates of National
Insurance contributions and in return, promise to provide minimum levels of
benefit for their scheme members.
From 1988, employers promise to increase the GMP portion of pension annually
by three per cent, and for those whose service has been interrupted to
uprate the GMP portion at seven per cent per year for each year until the
pension is drawn.
The pensions industry is urging the government to address the GMP issue when
it publishes its recommendations on equalisation of state pension ages for
men and women because GMP, available to men and women at different ages,
must also be equalised.
A Department of Social Security spokesman said: 'The government is aware
that employers feel there are problems with administering the GMP and that
they would like to see simpler alternatives introduced.
'However, if GMP were to be abolished there would have to be alternative
contracting out arrangements to ensure the system operated properly and that
the pensions positions of individuals was protected.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Delors pushes for monetary 'fortress Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, is pressing for a
monetary 'fortress Europe' to deter US and other non-EC speculators from
targeting currencies inside the European Monetary System.
After days of confusion, senior EC officials have confirmed that Mr Delors
favours selective measures such as temporary capital controls on foreigners
engaged in short-term speculation - such as Mr George Soros, the New
York-based investor.
Mr Delors called for collective EC action against speculators on Wednesday
during a bitter and at times emotional speech to the European parliament in
Strasbourg, in which he attacked 'Anglo-Saxon' critics of European Monetary
Union and branded currency speculators as 'golden boys'.
Many interpreted Mr Delors' remarks as advocating at least partial
reimposition of capital controls.
The president's chief spokesman, however, said the Commission president had
been misunderstood and that the importance of the speech had been
overestimated because it had 'only' been delivered to the European
parliament.
It emerged yesterday, though, that senior EC officials were privately
shocked by Mr Delors' comments, since they left the impression that he sided
with a minority of French and other continental commentators who have blamed
the EMS collapse on a currency plot by 'Anglo-Saxons'.
Other officials remain unimpressed at Mr Delors' suggestion of collective EC
action to impose a so-called 'safeguard' clause allowing all member states
to introduce temporary controls to deal with adverse capital movements
affecting their currency and monetary policies.
Senior Brussels officials emphasised yesterday that Mr Delors was not
advocating reimposition of capital controls within the single European
market, but was interested in targeting investors engaged in short-term
speculation, operating from New York or Tokyo. 'Delors is drawing a
distinction between what happens inside the EC and what happens outside,'
said one.
That interpretation looks like a direct threat to money market fund
operators such as Mr Soros, who made Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) profit
betting on a sterling devaluation last year.
It is certain to provoke charges in the UK, Germany, Japan and the US - all
of which favour the freedom of movement of currencies and are sceptical that
governments can regulate the Dollars 1,000bn daily foreign exchange market -
that Mr Delors wants to erect a monetary 'fortress Europe'.
Officials close to Mr Delors defended the president's other chief suggestion
to defend the EMS: a tightening of the rules governing short-term
speculation, possibly by requiring that banks lending money to speculators
should be required to deposit an equivalent amount at the relevant central
bank.
In his Strasbourg speech, which coincided with the first anniversary of
Black Wednesday, when the pound and lira were forced out of the ERM, Mr
Delors said Anglo-Saxons were dreaming if they believed that 'paradise'
would have arrived sooner without fixed exchange rates between EC
currencies.
'We should not under-estimate the effect of the past two or three years,
when there has been this movement of ideas led by the Anglo-Saxons
condemning as unrealistic or dangerous the objective of a single currency,'
he said.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Daimler plunges to loss of Pounds 380m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, plunged to a net loss of
DM949m (Pounds 380m) in the first half of 1993, a swing of nearly DM2bn from
a net profit of DM965m in the same period last year.
The automotive, aerospace and electronics group warned that its financial
performance had deteriorated still further in the third quarter this year.
The scale of the underlying losses were disclosed for the first time, as
Daimler-Benz was forced to present its financial results according to US
accounting conventions ahead of its imminent listing on the New York Stock
Exchange on October 5.
It will become the first German corporation to be listed on the NYSE, the
world's largest equity market.
The US-style figures reveal a much clearer picture of the underlying losses
of what has traditionally been Germany's most successful industrial company.
The results expose the full consequences of the German recession on the
group, which said it had also suffered an 'enormous fall in revenue' as a
result of the appreciation of the D-Mark over the last year.
The full impact of this is disguised under German accounting, which allows
the release of provisions from so-called hidden reserves to camouflage the
operating losses. Under German rules the group made a profit of DM168m for
the first six months, down from a profit of DM1.02bn in the same period of
last year.
Deutsche Bank, Daimler-Benz's largest shareholder, said it would probably
reduce its 28 per cent stake in the company to 25 per cent early next year
by offering some of its shares to US investors. The disposal would raise
just under DM1bn for the bank, leaving it with a holding worth some DM8bn.
Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz chief executive, said the group was planning
further steps to reduce its cost-base, by accelerating and extending job
cuts and by establishing more manufacturing outside Germany.
Faced by plunging car and commercial vehicle sales across Europe, including
a 34 per cent fall in its commercial vehicle sales in Germany alone in the
first half of the year, Daimler-Benz is now planning to cut a total of
43,900 jobs worldwide in 1993 and 1994.
Of this, 35,000 jobs are to be eliminated in Germany and would include some
compulsory redundancies, warned Mr Reuter.
Group turnover fell to DM41.64bn from DM48.09bn in the same period a year
ago. Daimler-Benz said it was still on course to achieve turnover
approaching DM100bn for the full year, however, after DM98.5bn last year.
Financial analysts forecast yesterday that the group would lose DM2bn on a
US basis for the whole of 1993. Despite this gloomy prognosis, the group's
share price rose strongly yesterday to close up DM19 at DM721.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Saint-Gobain posts sharp
downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAINT-GOBAIN, the French glass and building materials group, yesterday
announced 1993 first-half net profits of FFr452m (Dollars 81m), a sharp fall
from the FFr1.4bn recorded in the same period last year.
The decline in profits was blamed on 'the scale of the economic crisis in
Europe', which the company said affected virtually all of its product
markets. The company said that all of its principal customers in the
building, vehicle and packaging sectors had sharply reduced demand,
resulting in weaker volumes and prices.
The downturn was reflected in the sales figures for the half, which declined
to FFr35.74bn from FFr38.77bn in the 1992 period.
In spite of the problems in its European markets, the company said there
were some bright spots in the first-half performance.
The US and Latin American markets benefited from stronger general economic
conditions, which Saint-Gobain described as 'encouraging'.
All of the company's divisions suffered a fall in profits with the exception
of building materials, which receives about 90 per cent of its sales in the
US. Glass operations suffered from the sharp contraction in the European car
market, while the fibres division suffered from a fall in prices.
At the end of the first half, the group's net debt stood at FFr18.1bn, about
the same level as the beginning of the year, and about FFr2.2bn less than at
the end of June 1992.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Austrian oil group announces
shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the troubled Austrian integrated oil and petrochemicals group, has
embarked on a Sch3.7bn (Dollars 331m) restructuring programme to bring it
back into profit next year.
The partially-privatised group revealed last Friday that it would suffer a
Sch1bn operating loss and pass its dividend this year, as slumping prices in
European markets undermined its refining and petrochemical product margins.
It had earlier forecast a modest profit for the year.
Mr Richard Schenz, the chief executive, said yesterday that the group would
cut 40 per cent of its ammonia fertiliser capacity and would withdraw its
geotextiles subsidiary from the US market.
These and other restructuring measures would entail the loss of at least
1,500 jobs, nearly 12 per cent of its workforce, over the next two and a
half years.
The group's latest reverses have shaken both its own supervisory board and
the Vienna Borse, although public threats by Mr Oskar Grunwald, the
supervisory board chairman, to sack the personnel director and strip Mr
Schenz of some responsibilities have not been carried out.
Mr Schenz said he was still hopeful that the first step in the group's full
privatisation plans, the sale of a 20 per cent stake to a strategic partner,
could be fixed before year-end.
He admitted he was wrong to make a profit forecast in April, but said he
could not be blamed for the sudden deterioration in trading conditions in
the second quarter.
The group suffered its largest loss - Sch417m - in the second quarter, more
than treble the loss in the first quarter. It was then that the managing
board decided it had to take radical steps rather than hope that an economic
recovery would enable it to restructure more gradually.
Mr Schenz said he was not going to resign, and that the question was not
discussed at Wednesday's supervisory board meeting.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday invited 21 of the 700,000 people who have
written to the White House about US health care to come to Washington for a
citizens' forum.
Thus Mr Clinton has set about putting his campaigning skills at the service
of governing, ahead of what is likely to be the most complex challenge of
his presidency, reform of the US health care system,
Returning to a skill he perfected during his election campaign last year,
the president yesterday used personal stories to humanise some of the main
themes of the reform plan he will present in detail next Wednesday.
The tales - of struggling to pay for a relative's care, of being unable to
change job for fear of losing health insurance, of being charged Dollars
2,407 for a pair of crutches - were all fuel to his fire.
Opinion polls suggest the Clinton administration has been successful in
convincing people that the system needs reform. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC
poll, out yesterday, 78 per cent said that US health care was a big problem.
Less successful, however, has been the effort to persuade people that they
would benefit by Mr Clinton's proposed reforms. Most people are still fairly
happy with their own health care and insurance coverage, and only 20 per
cent in the poll thought they would be helped by Mr Clinton's plan. Even so,
55 per cent thought the country as a whole would be helped.
The White House's central message yesterday was the need to tackle insurance
companies' reluctance to cover people who have suffered an illness or who
have sick children or parents. Coverage is refused on the grounds of a
pre-existing condition. Mr Clinton said the pre-existing condition was now
'part of the everyday vocabulary of most working men and women in this
country. . . if you have it, you either can't get health insurance or you
can never leave the job you're in.'
But Mr Clinton also tackled head-on the issue likely to become one of the
most controversial in his plan: the requirement that all businesses provide
health insurance to their employees, paying at least 80 per cent of the
costs. This mandate is the principal difference between the Clinton reform
plan and proposals outlined by the Republicans this week.
Mr Clinton said that employers who did not provide health insurance to their
workers were getting a 'free ride' by using a health care system paid for by
those who did.
The president added: 'I don't want to pretend that this is all going to be
easy, but it seems to me that it is a fair thing to say everyone in America
should make some contribution to his or her own health insurance, and all
employers should make some contribution.'

<TEXT>
THE Cuban government has announced farm reforms to reduce state control over
agriculture, AP reports from Mexico City.
In the Communist Party daily Granma, the government said it would set up co
 -operatives on state land and allowing farmers to share in their profits.
The move is the latest in a series of retreats from hardline socialist
policy in Cuba, whose economy has shrunk by half since 1989, due to the loss
of its socialist backers.
The country's Catholic bishops, meanwhile, challenged the government to
introduce political as well as economic reforms in the bluntest church
criticism in decades of President Fidel Castro's regime.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Trade points way to Macedonian progress: Name trouble eases
for former Yugoslav republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SKOPJE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLEAREST sign of improved relations between Macedonia and Greece was the
appearance this summer of Greek brands of ice-cream at kiosks in Skopje, the
Macedonian capital.
Until recently, no Greek exporter would risk being accused of unpatriotic
behaviour by sending consumer goods to Macedonia. Dozens of joint ventures,
set up by Greek companies when Macedonia was part of Yugoslavia, were frozen
after it became independent in 1991.
The Greek government's objection to Macedonia's choice of name, on the
grounds that it implies a territorial claim on the northern Greek province
of Macedonia, resulted in an unofficial but damaging embargo on bilateral
trade.
Greek insistence that the republic of Macedonia find a different name in
order to win international recognition also soured relations with its EC
partners.
However, the Greeks have become less intransigent, agreeing last month to
hold direct talks with Macedonia, under UN auspices.
Whatever the outcome of the Greek general election on Oct 10, policy on
Macedonia is unlikely to change markedly. If the opposition socialists come
to power, they will, like the conservatives, refuse to budge on the name
issue, while being willing to encourage better economic relations.
Macedonia has managed to shake off diplomatic and economic isolation by
joining the United Nations under a temporary name, Former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia (Fyrom), in April. It has since been recognised by more than 30
countries.
Banks abroad are now willing to extend credit to Macedonian companies.
Foreign exchange reserves have tripled this year, to Dollars 130m, while the
new Macedonian currency, the denar, has stabilised against the dollar and
the D-mark.
Discussions with the International Monetary Fund on a stand-by loan are to
begin soon.
Even so, the talks in New York, to start once the Greek election is over,
must make substantive progress if Macedonia is to start pulling its economy
into shape, according to Mr Stevo Crvenkovski, foreign minister.
'It's important to get agreement quickly on some practical things. The
Greeks are our natural trading partners, so economic co-operation is
important. So is movement of people,' the minister said.
Since the name dispute erupted, Greece has granted very few entry visas to
Macedonians.
In the old days, thousands of Macedonians used to head for the Aegean Sea,
two hours' drive away, on a hot day. Now they are restricted to swimming in
chilly Lake Ochrid.
The absence of both Macedonian and Serbian visitors is blamed for a steep
decline in tourism to northern Greece, where the hoteliers' association
recently appealed to the government for compensation.
However, Mr Crvenkovski is cautious about predicting a compromise on the
name issue. Both sides rejected a proposal in June from Mr Cyrus Vance, the
UN mediator, that Macedonia be recognised internationally as
'Novamakedonija'.
Both the Greek and Macedonian leaders will remain under pressure from their
respective nationalist factions to make no concession over the name. But
that would not affect the chances of reaching agreement on economic
co-operation and confidence-building measures, according to officials in
Skopje and Athens.
The Macedonians know that time is on their side. EC foreign ministers
already talk about Macedonia, not Fyrom. If the Greeks persist in being
difficult, Macedonia may simply ask the UN general assembly to be recognised
under that name.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Border deaths defendants guilty
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE case billed as Germany's most spectacular trial since the Nuremberg
Tribunal wound up yesterday with three second-level East German officials
convicted for killings at the Cold War border to the west, agencies report
from Berlin.
But the cancer-stricken former communist leader, Mr Erich Honecker, 81, was
in Chilean exile and his security chief, Mr Erich Mielke, 85, was in a
prison hospital when the 10-month proceedings ended.
Former Prime Minister Willi Stoph, the third ailing member of the National
Defence Council who prosecutors said had ordered border guards to shoot to
kill, was living at home.
Of the remaining defendants, former Defence Minister Heinz Kessler was
sentenced to seven and a half years in jail, his deputy, Fritz Streletz, to
five and a half years and Suhl district Communist party leader Hans Albrecht
to four and a half years. Mr Kessler and Mr Streletz, who have spent 28
months in prison, were freed after the trial pending appeal. Mr Albrecht has
been free on account of poor health. All had denied any wrongdoing.
As in the 1945-46 Nuremberg trial of Nazis, the court judged the leaders of
a defunct state for human rights abuses according to a code that did not
exist when the alleged crimes were committed.
The trial opened after earlier manslaughter convictions for individual
border guards sparked off charges that authorities were punishing only the
'little fish'. Mr Honecker, whom the court released in January because of
his terminal liver cancer, was overthrown in 1989.
Prosecutors originally picked out 13 deaths from among hundreds of border
killings for manslaughter charges against the six original defendants. This
was later narrowed down to seven cases.

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler slips ahead of interim
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL trading dominated activity yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was moderately lower ahead of today's options expiry and the DAX
index slipped 4.72 to 1,855.67. Turnover was estimated at DM5.8bn.
Daimler, which is scheduled to release interim figures this morning, fell
DM6.30 to DM702.50 in expectation of weak data.
However, Bank Julius Bar, in a recent note on the car sector, commented that
because of restructuring measures, which will lead to 'sharply rising
earnings in 1994, we see the greatest turn around potential for VW and
Daimler'. Volkswagen was off DM1.50 at DM349.
Viag went against the trend with a rise of DM5 to DM435.00 after announcing
the terms of its forthcoming capital increase.
AMSTERDAM, also affected by options expiry today, was slightly stronger as
shares recovered some of Wednesday's losses. The CBS Tendency index advanced
1.2 or 1 per cent to 123.6.
Ahold recorded a gain of Fl 1.60 to Fl 88.60 after announcing details of a
share split ahead of its proposed listing in New York.
PARIS settled back slightly, the CAC-40 index off just 2.87 at 2,075.64 in
turnover of FFr3.8bn.
Chargeurs came off FFr16 to FFr1,135 following the release of its interim
figures after the close of trading on Wednesday which disappointed analysts.
James Capel yesterday downgraded Thomson-CSF to a sell on the worsening
outlook for Credit Lyonnais, in which Thomson has a 22 per cent stake.
Capel's forecast that Thomson will cut its dividend for the second year in a
row, suffer as a result of losses at Credit Lyonnais and see 1993 earnings
possibly fall 'to a lower level than in any year since 1984'. Thomson was
unchanged yesterday at FFr165 while the bank's CI's lost FFr12 to FFr688.
MILAN saw one of its recent fears come true as Italmobiliare, the industrial
holding company, announced that it was launching a three-prong capital
increase involving a three-for-10 stock offer, plus warrants and convertible
bonds.
Worries about an impending rush of rights issues have overhung the market
and the Comit index responded to yesterday's unexpected announcement with a
14.89 or 2.4 per cent fall to 596.15.
Italmobiliare shed L1,843 or 4.3 per cent to L41,300, while Fiat was L212 or
3.4 per cent lower at L5,981 as recent worries were rekindled that it might
also be planning an issue, speculation that it has denied.
Ms Deborah Rees of Smith New Court said there was concern that the market
would not be able to digest a rash of issues if companies were prompted to
launch capital raising exercises ahead of the government's privatisation
programme. She added that some estimates forecast that the government aimed
to raise up to L38,000bn from privatisations in 1994, which compared with
L8,000bn of Italian equities currently held in Italian mutual funds.
Ferruzzi again traded limit down, losing L32.50 or 10 per cent to L294.20 in
the wake of Wednesday's statement from Consob defending its decision not to
suspend trading in the shares.
ZURICH shadowed the dollar and initially easier prices firmed as the US
currency rose, leaving the SMI index to close 12.6 higher at 2,374.4.
Nestle, which traded as low as SFr1,039 in early business, finished SFr17
ahead at SFr1,158, while UBS bearers added SFr20 to SFr1,153.
STOCKHOLM saw a late rally lift some prices, with Ericsson B shares adding
SKr9 to SKr400. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 6.1 to 1,259.6 in
turnover of SKr1.4bn.
Volvo B retreated further, off SKr5 to SKr417.
ISTANBUL finished at a second straight record high in active trading, mostly
focused on blue chips and banking shares. The composite index rose 200.5 or
1.45 per cent to 14,026.6 for a gain on the week of 8.32 per cent.
Rising demand for Eregli, the steel group, helped the market ahead and the
share rose TL300 or 9.6 per cent to TL3,400.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen climbs sharply on package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN appreciated sharply against the dollar in European trading
yesterday, breaking through the important Y105 barrier, as dealers took the
view that Tokyo's latest economic stimulation package would disappoint the
US, writes James Blitz.
Since August 19 the seven-month-long rise of the yen had been halted, amid
signs that the US government had been mollified by the prospect of a big
fiscal boost. The Federal Reserve's intervention on that day made dealers
think the Clinton administration was no longer seeking a dollar depreciation
in an attempt to reduce the Japanese trade surplus.
Yesterday's package was a less powerful stimulus than many dealers had
expected. The headline figure for the package, at about 6 trillion yen, was
larger than had been anticipated, and the Japanese authorities claimed it
would put 1.3 percentage points on gross development product.
But there was no specific promise from the Japanese authorities to reduce
income tax and there was no cut in the official discount rate.
Comments from US officials were far from hopeful that pressure would come
off the Japanese authorities.
In the European afternoon, Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, said the
administration had expected that a bigger stimulus would be forthcoming.
Earlier in the day an unnamed official had been quoted as saying that the
proposed package would fall far short of what was needed to boost the
country's economy.
After closing at Y106.25 per dollar on Wednesday night, the yen broke
through the Y105 level and closed in London at Y104.40. A dealer suggested
that the yen could now break through the Y100 level for the first time. In
New York the yen finished at Y104.22.
At the start of US trading, the dollar weakened sharply against the D-Mark,
falling as low as DM1.5875, after US indicators showed that the country's
trade deficit was still very high. The data showed that the trade deficit
remained at a sizeable Dollars 10.34bn in July.
But there was strong buying of the dollar at this level, as US fund managers
entered the market, buying the US currency at what they clearly perceived
was a very cheap level. The dollar ended in London at DM1.6065, against a
previous DM1.5930, and in New York it closed at DM1.6037.
In Europe, sterling fell sharply following a very strong attack on Mr John
Major's leadership in two articles written by Mr Norman Lamont, the former
UK chancellor. The currency was also undermined by figures which showed the
second consecutive monthly rise in unemployment.
Both pieces of news raised speculation that the British government might
again be moved to cut UK base rates, either at the time of the Conservative
party's annual conference or in Mr Kenneth Clarke's first budget. The pound
closed at DM2.4625 from a previous DM2.4725.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Danes trigger rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER several days of uncertainty about the direction of European interest
rates, there was a new mood of optimism yesterday, helped in particular by a
cut in Denmark's official interest rates, writes James Blitz.
The Danish central bank lowered its discount and key deposit rates to 8.75
per cent from 9.25 per cent with immediate effect. Yesterday's move followed
last week's  1/2 percentage point easing in the Bundesbank's discount rate.
But it was the first discount and deposit rates cut since the central bank
raised both instruments by 1.5 percentage points to defend the krona in the
turmoil that preceded the widening of the European exchange rate mechanism
bands in August.
The move helped French franc interest rate futures to rise, even though the
Bank of France again left its official interest rates unchanged at its
regular Thursday intervention. The December French franc contract added 6
basis points to close at 93.76.
In Germany, Euromark futures were also a little stronger as dealers took the
view that sell-offs earlier this week had been a little over-done.
Comments from Mr Wilhelm Noelling, a former Bundesbank council member, that
the discount rate would be at 4 per cent by the end of the year helped
sentiment. So, too, did a rather dovish Bundesbank monthly report.
The Bundesbank drew attention to improving trends in M3 money supply from
October onwards. While calling for fiscal consolidation, it acknowledged
that first half deficits had gone according to plan; and it also admonished
France and Denmark for having cut their interest rates too timidly.
The December contract was up 3 basis points at a close of 93.95 and the
March 1994 contract gained 4 basis points, ending at 94.46.
Sterling interest rate futures also rebounded after the heavy downturn of
recent days. But the second consecutive monthly rise in UK unemployment also
helped to turn sentiment in the market.
The December short sterling contract moved up 8 basis points to close at
94.28 and the March 1994 contract climbed 10 basis points to finish at
94.39.
Events in the sterling cash market were less eventful. Three-month interest
rates again closed at 5 31/32 per cent. There was an Pounds 800m shortage
forecast by the Bank of England at the start of trading, which was only
removed through late assistance - but the overnight rate hovered at 6 per
cent for most of the day.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sales of jewellery in Japan
boost demand for platinum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Barry Davison, managing director of South Africa's Rustenburg Platinum
Mines, expects Japan's total platinum demand to reach between 63 and 64
tonnes this year, compared with 56.3 tonnes in 1992, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
He forecast that the country's platinum jewellery sales would rise from last
year's 40 tonnes to between 42 and 43 tonnes, thanks to healthy sales of
lower-priced platinum jewellery.
Rustenburg, one of three platinum group metal producers within the
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, is one of the world's biggest platinum
producers.
'The growth in jewellery is expected to more than offset the reduction in
the auto-catalyst sector,' Mr Davison said. Platinum demand for
exhaust-cleaning catalytic converters for Japan's flagging motor industry
was expected to fall by about 2.5 tonnes in 1993 from 9.5 tonnes last year,
he noted.
He added that the Japanese investment sector was likely to show resilience
because of lower yen prices resulting from the national currency's strength
against the US dollar this year. He declined to comment on expected price
levels.
According to Finance Ministry statistics, Japan's total platinum imports for
the first seven months of 1993 were 37.67 tonnes on a customs-cleared basis,
against 35.54 tonnes in the same period last year.
US platinum consumption would also increase in 1993, mainly reflecting a
recovery in car sales, Mr Davison forecast, while in Europe, demand would
rise with the introduction of new regulations requiring all new cars to have
catalytic converters, despite a drop in motor sales. He said he saw a slight
increase in overall demand.
Platinum supply will also get a boost from greater South African output, he
said. 'Overall, 1993 demand/supply of platinum will more or less be in
balance.'
Mr Davison thought it was unlikely, however, that prices would rise
dramatically for the time being.
'I don't see any major improvement in commodity prices in general, platinum
group metals and nickel included, until there is clear evidence of a
sustainable recovery in the world economy,' he said.
'Once such a recovery is under way, which will probably not occur for
another 12 months, I do see the prospect of platinum group metal prices
showing steady improvement,' he added.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa price touches Pounds 900
as surge gathers momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRICES soared yesterday as the market got to grips with a stream of
forecasts predicting a shortfall in this year's crop. The December futures
contract closed at a three-year high of Pounds 899 a tonne, up Pounds 37 a
tonne on the day.
At one point the London Commodity Exchange closed the cocoa market for 15
minutes as the March and May futures contracts hit their limit of a Pounds
40 a tonne rise - the first time this has happened for about 18 months.
December futures touched the key psychological barrier of Pounds 900 a tonne
but slipped at the close to Pounds 899 a tonne. 'It's unbelievable, nothing
seems to be stopping it,' one trader said.
The cocoa market has gathered momentum over the past couple of weeks on a
steady stream of poor harvest projections and analysts' forecasts of a
shortfall against demand for the third season in a row.
Trading was hectic yesterday as speculators and industry buyers piled in to
the rapidly rising market. Some manufacturers have kept out of the cocoa
market in recent weeks for fear they were witnessing a speculative rally
that would soon fizzle out.
'It's not a rally any more but a bull move and some people are talking a
couple of hundred pounds higher in the next two months,' said one trader.
The problem with the cocoa crop is that prices have been depressed for so
long that farmers have had little to invest in their crops. This has caused
many trees to weaken, reducing their yields as well as leaving them open to
attack by parasites.
Last week ED &amp;F. Man, the London trade house, forecast a deficit of 200,000
tonnes in the 1993-94 cocoa crop and a further shortfall of 150,000 tonnes
the following year. Particular problems have hit the harvest in the Ivory
Coast, which produces a third of the world's cocoa.
Although there have been output shortfalls for the past two seasons, cocoa
prices, depressed by seven years of surplus, hit their lowest level since
the mid-1970s last year.
Now that the market move has taken off, traders are not worried that plans
to liquidate the International Cocoa Organisation's buffer stock of cocoa
will depress prices. Delegates are due to hold their final meeting this
morning to agree a plan to sell cocoa over four and a half years at a rate
of 51,000 tonnes a year.
Coffee prices slipped as traders began profit-taking following a producers
meeting on Wednesday on the export retention scheme that is to come into
force on October 1. The November futures contract closed Dollars 6 a tonne
lower at Dollars 1,290 a tonne after touching Dollars 1,280 a tonne at one
point.
'There is some confusion in the market, but if you expect the producers'
retention scheme to work, you will see higher prices in the next couple of
months,' said Mr Peter Kettle, analyst at ED &amp; F. Man.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Volcano pushes Patagonian sheep
over the brink - After years of struggle the eruption was the last straw for
many
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHEEP farms of Patagonia are gradually disappearing. Sheep farming, the
only agricultural activity the barren, windswept steppes can support, has
become a ruinously loss-making business. Farmers burdened by rising debts
and falling incomes are abandoning their properties in increasing numbers.
Patagonia's sheep sector began declining in the 1960s, but the downturn
accelerated dramatically two years ago. The collapse in the international
wool market - a glut has driven prices to the lowest point in living memory
 -coincided lethally with spreading desertification, a radical shift in
government economic policy and natural disaster.
On August 13, 1992, Mount Hudson, a volcano high in the Chilean Andes
erupted, spewing vast quantities of ash over the southern half of Patagonia.
The ash ruined the sheep's wool, making it worthless, and transformed areas
of the province of Santa Cruz into wasteland. Sheep could not graze on the
ash-covered land and slowly died.
Mr Jimmy Patterson, a wool trader and descendant of the Scottish farmers who
first introduced sheep to Patagonia from the nearby Falkland Islands in
1885, says the ash made his parents close their 30,000-hectare family farm
on the east coast of Santa Cruz. Last year, 452 farms covering 8m hectares
in Santa Cruz went the same way. For most of them, the eruption was the coup
de grace that followed years of mounting losses.
Closures are common elsewhere in Patagonia and Mr Juan Ventura, who owns
three farms, says they will become more frequent. 'You don't see the effects
immediately. What is happening is that farmers are consuming their capital.
They're not spending on maintenance. Eventually they go bankrupt.'
Many farmers are trying to hang on. Mr Raul Assef, who owns a 1,500-hectare
farm on the western edge of Patagonia, says 'both my wife and I work in town
and use our wages to cover the loss of running the farm. You never know what
might happen in this country and the market might even recover one day'.
Patagonia's isolated farms cover huge areas but can only support small
flocks, making them expensive to run. In arid central Patagonia a sheep
needs 5 ha to graze on and farms of 2,500 ha are common.
Few farmers can afford the investments needed to improve efficiency or
switch over to more profitable cattle farming. Those who can are expanding
their cattle herds, now that Patagonia has been declared free of
foot-and-mouth disease.
Beef 'imports' from the infected north are banned, allowing local producers
to charge premium prices.
Others are branching into flower or fruit production. In the watered,
protected mountain valleys to the west, strawberries, boysenberries and
raspberries grow well. The government is negotiating a joint World Bank and
Inter-American Development Bank loan for an irrigation project in the east
of the province.
Even if wool prices do recover, Patagonia's farmers will not be able to
raise output much. A century of over-grazing has devastated the central
plateau, which covers about one third of Argentina's territory.
Desertification is a serious problem.
The arid plains are framed by distant low-lying hills and dotted with
occasional termite hills The stony soil is covered with khaki-coloured
shrubs and tufts of tough grass. Occasionally, small groups of sheep can be
seen searching for foliage.
Mr Guillermo Defosse, economic development under-secretary in the province
of Chubut, says that although the region's wool is considered to among 'the
finest in the world, little consideration was given to the vegetation and
the soil which supported that production'.
Production this year is forecast at 90,000 tonnes, 13 per cent less than
last year. In Chubut, wool production has fallen to 18,000 tonnes in 1992
from 26,833 tonnes a decade earlier.
Argentina's adoption four years ago of free market policies compounded these
setbacks. The government abolished its hated agricultural export taxes and
reduced other taxes. But its anti-inflation policies led to a strong
revaluation of the currency, reducing export revenues and increasing costs.
These policies hit farmers throughout Argentina, but few are suffering as
much as those in Patagonia. Federal and local governments are helping with
cheap loans, subsidies, grants and tax breaks worth over USDollars 75m are
available to support or convert farms to other activities.
Policy is confused, however. A Chubut official said 'one department wants
small farms to merge to reduce stocking levels and another encourages them
to survive by sharing equipment or through credit unions'. He also
recognises that the government has done little to introduce modern farming
and water-management methods that are less harmful to the land.
Although the disappearance of Patagonia's sheep farms is leading to the
depopulation of a vast area of the country and creating serious social
problems, it could at least have the long-term benefit of relieving pressure
on the land and slow the advance of desertification.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Contract security is main
concern of UK dairy farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK DAIRY farmers are more concerned about the security of their supply
contracts with dairy companies when the industry enters a free market next
April than they are about price, according to a survey published today in
Farmers Weekly magazine.
The survey of 918 farmers found that 87 per cent of them were worried about
security - in view of the fact that contracts to supply dairy companies and
Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk Marketing Board, run for only one
year - and 79 per cent were concerned about prices.
Milk Marque has wooed farmers by holding out the hope of higher prices for
their milk. And large dairy companies such as Northern Foods and MD Foods
have responded by suggesting that they will pay a premium over the Milk
Marque price.
But farmers appear to be looking for arrangements with a longer life than
the 12 months generally on offer, and half of those surveyed said they did
not trust the dairy companies to protect their interests.
The poll found that farmers could choose between 19 options for selling
their milk among large and small dairies, local groups and Milk Marque.
Among those who had already decided which organisation to link up with in
the new free market, 71 per cent said they would stick with Milk Marque and
4 per cent opted for the Northern Milk Partnership, which has been set up by
Northern Foods.
Farmers were almost equally split on whether they would agree to have their
milk collected on alternate days as the Milk Marketing Board has suggested -
52 per cent said they woud consider it and 47 per cent refused.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum up in New York and
London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having moved up strongly in the New York market overnight, the platinum
price opened sharply higher in London yesterday. It edged up further during
the day to reach Dollars 360.90 a troy ounce at the afternoon fixing, up
Dollars 7.15 from Tuesday.
The rise was encouraged by the continued recovery in the gold price, which
closed at Dollars 352.25 an ounce, up Dollars 4.65 on the day. Gold's rise
was attributed to investment fund buying and short-covering following the
recent sharp fall, which dealers said had left the market heavily oversold.
They also noted that the rally was encouraged by the return of physical
demand form south-east Asia.
The dealers said that the platinum price had been overdue for a correction
relative to the gold price as its premium over the yellow metal had narrowed
sharply in the course of the recent general decline in precious metals
markets. Immediately before gold retreated below the Dollars 400-an-ounce
mark on August 6 platinum's premium had stood at Dollars 17.50, but that had
shrunk to Dollars 6.50 earlier this week.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: High-powered smelters find the
going too hot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PECHINEY, Europe's biggest aluminium producer, is working with other
producers to gather as much information as possible about unexpected
technical problems affecting plant installed at the world's most
recently-completed aluminium smelters, all using the French group's
leading-edge technology.
Nearly 1m tonnes of annual capacity using this AP30 technology came into
operation in 1991 and 1992 at three very similar new smelters costing about
Dollars 1bn each and at an expanded operation at Alba in Bahrain.
Operators say that so-called 'hot spots' have developed in some electrolytic
reduction cells (called 'pots' in the industry jargon) and have lead to
failure of some pot walls after only 300 days, compared with the expected
life of 2,000 days.
Operators at the smelters involved say that at present the problem is not a
major one and they are convinced that Pechiney will eventually find a
solution.
Mr Christian Bickert, Pechiney's vice-president-aluminium technology,
confirmed that 60 pots at the group's own 250,000-tonnes-a-year smelter at
Dunkirk, which started up in November, 1991, had been affected. But he said
each one had been repaired and reactivated in 15 days. He said these were
'start-up problems'.
Other operators suggested, however, that, until Pechiney came up with a
solution, the problem would recur in repaired pots.
The two other smelters involved are both in Quebec, Canada, and have an
annual capacity of 215,000 each: Lauralco, owned by Amax of the US, and
Alouette, operated by VAW of Germany for a consortium which also includes
Hoogovens of the Netherlands, Austria Metall and a Japanese joint venture
between Kobe Steel and Marubeni.
The operators are now swapping information about the problems among
themselves and with Pechiney.
In aluminium smelting the aim is to push as much electricity through the raw
material as possible - the higher the amperage, the more metal can be
produced. But this is a tricky business. The magnetic fields created by huge
quantities of energy can play havoc and create very dangerous conditions in
the smelter if not properly controlled.
Pechiney won many technical contracts because it was the first company to
operate a pot line functioning at more than 280,000 amperes. At Dunkirk and
the other recent smelters, the group brought into operation the first
complete sets of pots running on a direct current of 300,000 amperes.
This technology makes the smelters the most productive in the world,
Pechiney claims. Dunkirk, for example, produces 400 tonnes of aluminium a
year for each one of the 550 members of the workforce.
The 300,000 amperes technology was a step up from the 280,000 amperes
Pechiney was previously offering. About 80 per cent of the smelters built
since 1985 use Pechiney's 280,000 amperes technology.
An executive at one of the new smelters said: 'Pechiney's 280,000 amperes
technology is absolutely perfect and we assumed that the new technology
would be the same. Our expectations were too high but, even so, Pechiney's
image has been dented a little by all this'.
Nevertheless, Alusaf of South Africa, the aluminium producer in the Gencor
group, although given the choice by Pechiney of 300,000 or 280,000 amperes
technology, is still opting for the former for a new Dollars 2bn,
466.000-tonnes smelter near its existing operations at Richards Bay. Mr
Francois Prins, Gencor's senior manager, intelligence and strategy, said the
opportunity to lift productivity from the present 80 tonnes per man a year
to 400 tonnes was irresistible and, in any case, Pechiney was giving certain
guarantees with the technology.

COPPER prices fell sharply on the lLondon Metal Exchange in after hours
trading, pressured by a savage contraction in the cash premiums, dealers
said. The cash to three months premium narrowed from Dollars 60 to Dollars
20 in about 30 minutes, as influential quarters, believed to be linked to
the recent squeeze, lent metal (sold cash and bought forward). The cash
price was last traded at Dollars 1,875 a tonne, down from Dollars 1,928 on
Wednesday and more than Dollars 2,000 just over a week ago. The three months
price ended at Dollars 1,850 a tonne, down Dollars 31.50 and Dollars 100
below the level reached at the height of the squeeze. One possible reason
for the sudden collapse in the tightness was talk that the major Far Eastern
company believed to be supporting the market had concluded a large long-term
physical pricing deal. Among the other LME contracts Tin's inexorable slide
continued, establishing fresh 20-yea lows, and nickel moved ominously close
to the Dollars 2-a-lb mark that some analysts have suggested will trigger
substantial production cuts. The three months price closed Dollars 80 down
at Dollars 4,437.50 a tonne, equivalent to Dollars 2.01 1/4 a lb.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Property Market: Scene set fair for a turnround - Sentiment
is buoyant, but concerns persist about the availability of suitable
properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few sectors have more cause to celebrate this week's first anniversary of
Black Wednesday than the property investment industry. Sterling's exit from
the European exchange rate mechanism, which eventually led to a 4 percentage
point reduction in UK interest rates, paved the way for a strong recovery in
investment demand.
Lower interest rates took the pressure off property companies' balance
sheets, easing the need to sell property. The high yields offered by
property and the falling cost of finance attracted overseas buyers and
private investors into the UK market. Growing confidence in the property
recovery, together with its high yields, prompted institutions to return to
the market.
The scale of this recovery is underlined in a report just published by DTZ
Debenham Thorpe, property consultants, which states that current potential
demand is the highest for at least five years. 'The retreat in the flow of
money into property over the past three years has reversed,' it says.
The report draws parallels with previous periods of heavy buying such as the
mid-1970s and the mid-late 1980s. 'The current bout of heavy buying fits the
cyclical pattern of property investment over the past 20-25 years,' says the
report. Periods of heavy buying have tended to be sporadic occuring when
values do not take sufficient account of the strength of expected demand, it
adds.
Different components of the market have been affected by the changed
conditions in different ways:
The institutional sector has experienced the biggest change in sentiment of
any sector. Its gross investment potential over the next 12-18 months could
exceed Pounds 7bn.
This represents a sea change in attitude. Last year, the combined
institutional net purchases of just less than Pounds 1bn was half the 1991
total and one of the lowest recorded over the past 12 years. As a percentage
of new investment, property has slipped from about 15 per cent at the start
of the 1980s to 5 per cent at the start of this year - 'a level that is
barely acceptable for a mainstream asset class', according to DTZ.
The abrupt change in outlook stems from increasing confidence in the
market's recovery, together with a greater appreciation of the attractions
of property's high, secure income as bond yields fall.
DTZ Debenham Thorpe Research surveyed 50 fund managers, who control Pounds
35bn of property or 60 per cent of total institutional property holdings.
DTZ found that investors were taking a 'very positive' view of future
performance, with nine out of 10 respondents saying that expectations of a
recovery in values over the next 1-2 years were an encouraging factor in
their investment decisions.
Property is viewed as a means of maintaining the performance of a portfolio,
given pessimistic expectations of future dividend growth and an
over-supplied gilts market.
The funds' total potential spending power could reach an annual peak of
Pounds 7bn over the next 12 months and remain at about Pounds 6bn through to
the middle of the present decade.
The DTZ survey suggests that about half the funds intend to raise investment
and maintain it at a high level for several years, 23 per cent propose a
short-term increase in purchases at some point over the next three years,
and 17 per cent are net sellers which intend to wind down their acquisition
programme.
But there are caveats. With so much money available for so few suitable
properties, values may rise to a point where they are no longer considered
as offering good value. Moreover, property sales are expected to increase
over the next two to three years.
About 55 per cent of funds expect to raise the turnover of their portfolios
this year, although only 10 per cent could be classified as heavy sellers.
Another concern for some funds is the possibility of legislative change
which could affect the security of rental income.
Enthusiasm for property is stronger among insurance companies than among
pension funds, says the report. A quarter of pension funds doubt whether
they will be positive investors over the next 12 months, compared with only
10 per cent of insurance companies. Pension funds' appetite for property is
restricted by the squeeze on their cashflow and the run-down of funds for
the large pension schemes.
Property companies are also playing an important role in the revival of the
property investment market. Share prices of property companies have nearly
doubled over the past year, providing excellent opportunities for companies
to tap the equity market.
Property companies have raised about Pounds 1.2bn in the six months to July
through rights issues, largely to reduce debt and fund new acquisitions.
Prospects for smaller companies are, however, more subdued, as most lack the
financial muscle to exploit the opportunities.
The knowledge that large property companies are no longer forced sellers has
increased confidence in the market. 'Whereas concern about the scale of
property company disposals has depressed the market in recent years, the
position is now almost reversed. The prospect that property companies are
becoming net buyers is widely seen as a positive influence on capital
values,' says the report.
Overseas investors have reduced their spending on UK property from Pounds
3bn at its peak in 1989-90, to an estimated Pounds 1 1/2 bn-Pounds 2bn for
1993. However, this level of investment may prove more enduring than the
investment pattern of the late 1980s, which was characterised by many
one-off mega-deals.
'The fall in volume represents a shift in the focus of overseas demand from
the mega-deals and developments of the late 1980s to a broader and
potentially more secure investment pattern.'
The majority of deals over the past 12-18 months have been struck by German
investors, although Asian and Middle Eastern investors have increased their
presence in the past 12 months.
Banks, unlike other sources of finance, are generally reluctant to increase
funds earmarked for property. 'For the forseeable future, possibly into the
mid-1990s, most banks are likely to be too preoccupied sorting out their
existing problems to enter into substantial new lending to the property
sector,' says the report.
Bank loans to UK property, which peaked at Pounds 41bn in May 1991, fell to
Pounds 36bn in mid-1993. Property debt is about 11 per cent of the banking
sector's commercial loan book, which despite being 1 percentage point lower
than in 1992, remains one of the highest exposures on record.
The banks' reluctance to lend to property may prevent the recovery from
spreading through to the entire market. But in some respects, the shortage
of bank finance is likely to add to the stablility of the market, since it
will prevent a surge in development from adding to the supply of new
buildings.
So long as interest rates and bond yields remain relatively low, the scene
is set fair for a continued surge in demand for property. The main concern
is that there are insufficient sellers of the right type of property at
current prices. This could force yields down below the level that buyers are
prepared to tolerate at this early stage in the cycle.
Although sentiment towards property has been transformed, it may take longer
than investors expect to translate enthusiasm into deals.

UK GILTS dropped nearly a point but recovered to end slightly higher, due to
a short squeeze in the futures market.
However, traders reported little buying on the lows, with international
investors deterred by sterling weakness and sentiment subdued by the
inflation spectre. Gilts are still 'trading on far too optimistic an outlook
on inflation,' said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of international bond research
at Yamaichi, who sees further downside for gilts.
Expectations of an auction announcement by the Bank of England today also
dampened interest in the cash market. Opinion remains split on the likely
maturity of the issue, with some traders betting on 2004 but others calling
for ultra-long dated debt.
FRENCH government bonds ended the day mixed, with 10-year bonds slightly
higher but 30-year bonds lower.
Traders remain frustrated by the uncertain outlook for French interest-rate
easing and were little surprised by the Bank of France's decision to leave
its 6.75 per cent repo rate unchanged at yesterday's open-market operation.
The key event today will be the release of gross domestic product data,
which are expected to show a 0.2 per cent decline in the second quarter.
DANISH government bonds eased about  1/4 point despite the central bank's
latest rate cuts. The Bank of Denmark cut its key deposit rates to 8.75 per
cent from 9.25 per cent and its two-week repo rate to 9.5 per cent from 10
per cent. While the Danish krone firmed on the news, 10-year bonds dropped
by more than  1/2 point before recouping some of their losses.
According to Mr Richard Gilhooly, international economist with Kidder
Peabody, liquidity pressures prevented the rate cuts from feeding into money
market rates, which remain above 10 per cent. This means that it is
expensive for traders to finance bond positions.
Traders reported a large seller of 10-year bonds in London, which further
depressed prices.
GERMAN bonds were less volatile but outperformed most other markets, with
the bund contract ending  1/4 point higher on a late squeeze in the futures
pits. Sentiment was also boosted by the Bundesbank's latest monthly report.
While the central bank reaffirmed its cautious easing stance, it said money
supply growth was set to slow. Analysts also welcomed its statement that
western German inflation rose by 2.5 per cent on a three-month annualised
basis.
JAPANESE government bonds eased again, mainly over disappointment that the
government's latest fiscal package was not accompanied by a cut in the 2.5
per cent official discount rate. Analysts expect the Bank of Japan to
monitor the currency's reaction to the package for a while before easing,
but most expect the cut to be imminent.
US Treasuries continued to trade in a volatile fashion yesterday morning,
posting modest early gains at the long end of the market before selling in
the afternoon pushed longer-dated yields back above 6 per cent.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/16 at 103
11/32 , yielding 6.003 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.841 per cent.
The day's economic news - slow August industrial production growth, a small
increase in weekly jobless claims and a narrowing in the trade deficit - was
mostly bullish for bonds, but given the market's uncertain, nervous mood,
the data had little impact on prices.
Prices opened firmer, buoyed by Wednesday's late rally which all but wiped
out the day's early heavy losses. Yet the initial upward momentum could not
be sustained, and prices see-sawed erratically around midday in the
slipstream of trading on the futures market. By mid-afternoon prices were
firmly entrenched in negative territory, and because of the Jewish new year
holiday, trading was relatively thin, exacerbating the market's volatility.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Argentina set to continue Latin
American sequence

THE international bond market had a Latin American flavour yesterday as
Venezuela launched its well-flagged, D-Mark Eurobond offering and Banobras,
the Mexican government agency for financing economic development, tapped the
dollar sector.
The Republic of Argentina is also due to tap the D-Mark sector. Mr Daniel
Marx, the finance under-secretary, said that Argentina will launch a
five-year Eurobond to raise between DM750m and DM1bn before the end of the
year. CSFB and Deutsche Bank have been awarded the mandate.
Mr Marx said the new placement was aimed at 'diversifying the investor base
by increasing sales in Europe and Germany in particular'. He added that the
D-Mark bonds will refinance Eurobond debt maturing this year.
The forthcoming offering will bring the government's bond sales to more than
Dollars 1bn this year. It follows two dollar-denominated Eurobond offerings
in April and July which raised a total of Dollars 500m. A third batch of
dollar debt will be issued in coming months, Mr Marx said.
Investors looking for high-yielding paper flocked to the Republic of
Venezuela's DM300m seven-year Eurobond offering. Demand was such that the
bonds' yield spread over underlying bunds narrowed to 260 basis points in
the afternoon from a break-even spread for co-managers of 290 basis points.
Lead manager WestLB said that retail clients in Germany and Switzerland were
particularly strong buyers of the bonds.
In the light of Venezuela's offering, the spread of 210 basis points over
underlying US Treasuries on the Dollars 100m five-year offering from
Banobras was not very tempting. The bonds were re-offered at 99.97 and they
were not freed to trade by the close of business.
The pricing of Banobras's bonds reflects the Mexican government's desire to
tighten the spread on its Eurobonds. However, investor focus has moved away
from Mexican offerings as other Latin American borrowers become more active
in the international bond market.
Corporacion Andina De Fomento, the Latin American supranational agency which
finances trade and infrastructure, is expected to launch a Dollars 100m
five-year Eurobond offering, via CSFB, early next week.
Elsewhere, the flow of Ecu-denominated Eurobonds continued as DNIB, the
Dutch re-development bank majority-owned by the government, raised Ecu150m
through an issue of five-year Eurobonds.
Lead manager Nomura said the DNIB issue was designed to tap the remaining
pockets of demand, particularly in Switzerland, for current-coupon bonds in
the Ecu sector. The bonds were re-offered at 99.47 and were not freed to
trade by the end of the afternoon.
As with the other recent issues, the bonds yielded less than the French
government's Ecu paper. This reflects the fact that there has been a
shortage of new Ecu-denominated issues.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Closed-end Vietnam fund meets
with strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for a new closed-end fund which invests in Vietnam has exceeded
expectations, reflecting the growing international interest in a
fast-growing Asian economy.
The Beta Viet Nam Fund has raised Dollars 65m through the placing of 1.3m
units, well above its target of Dollars 50m. Before its launch, the only
quoted vehicle for investment in the country was the Vietnam fund. Both
funds are listed in Dublin.
Mr Peter Scott, chief executive of Beta Funds, which specialises in
investing in emerging markets, said around 20 per cent of the units were
bought by Swiss, Scandinavian and Malaysian companies looking for an
exploratory investment. The remainder was bought by institutions.
In the event of the US lifting its economic embargo against Vietnam, the
fund will be reopened in order to satisfy demand from US investors, Mr Scott
said.
US companies are barred from investing directly in Vietnam and can only
participate in development projects which are funded by international
financial institutions, such as the World Bank or the International Monetary
Fund.
The immediate aim of the Beta Viet Nam Fund is to invest in joint ventures
that are likely to get a stock market listing in the future. The long-term
objective of the fund is to devote its investment to listed companies.
For example, the fund is thought to be involved in a joint venture which
will build and operate a new international passenger terminal at Noi Bai
Airport in Hanoi.

THE Singapore International Monetary Exchange is to go ahead with plans to
launch a Japanese government bond futures contract, in spite of objections
by the Tokyo stock exchange.
Mr Ang Swee Tian, president of Simex, said the decision to list the contract
 -from October 1 - was in response to demand from international market
participants, particularly the US-based Managed Futures Association.
'We also explained to the TSE officials that we believed the development of
a Simex JGB contract would generate increased interest in (the JGB market)
among global users,' many of whom already trade Simex's short-term
Eurodollar and Euroyen interest rate contracts, said Mr Ang.
He added that the inter-market trading opportunities would be 'mutually
beneficial' to the two exchanges.
However, Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the TSE, strongly criticised Simex
for not consulting with the exchange before the plan's announcement.
The move by Simex will harm the supply and demand situation as well as the
market mechanism on the TSE, he said.
The Simex contract is identical to that of the TSE, with a 6 per cent coupon
and a 10-year maturity.
The row is expected to worsen the relationship between the two exchanges,
which has already been soured by the success of Simex's Nikkei futures
contract, based on the Nikkei 225 stock index of the TSE.
The TSE has blamed stock futures and options trading for the volatility of
Japanese shares, and has been unhappy over Simex's refusal to implement
restrictions.
Trading of Nikkei futures on Simex has soared while the Osaka stock
exchange, which lists Nikkei 225 stock futures, has tried to curb trading by
increasing regulations.

FAY, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank, yesterday reported after-tax
profits of NZDollars 52.7m (USDollars 29.1m) for the year ended June, up
from NZDollars 24.3m a year earlier.
Pre-tax profits were little changed at NZDollars 14m. The net result
includes a NZDollars 40.7m profit on the sale of shares in Bank of New
Zealand, while the 1991-92 result took in a NZDollars 10.1m credit from
equity earnings against zero this time.
Mr David Richwhite, joint chief executive, said the merchant banking
operations earned NZDollars 17m in the year, up from NZDollars 12m.
Non-recurring costs were NZDollars 5.1m relating to the holding costs of the
Bank of New Zealand shares. Mr Richwhite said that total income from the
banking division was NZDollars 77m. Income from the New Zealand division was
in line with budget but Australian profits fell.
He said that the company expected to report an improved result in the
current year from its merchant banking operations.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Treading a road to strong
profits - UBS's London operation believes it is on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE Union Bank of Switzerland, Switzerland's largest bank, bought Phillips
&amp; Drew back in 1985, the road to strong returns for UBS's London operations
has been a long one. But in the first half of this year, London contributed
more than 20 per cent of UBS's 89 per cent surge in profits for the first
half of 1993.
Clearly, market conditions helped. 'Brisk activity on the major securities
markets, with dramatic rallies in some cases, as well as volatile
fluctuations in various foreign exchange rates and lower money market rates,
led to record profits,' said UBS's own results report.
But Mr Rudi Muller, chairman and chief executive of UBS Limited, the London
operation, insists that market conditions are only one factor. 'Our build-up
has thoroughly paid off and we are going to be an increasingly important
financial institution,' he says.
UBS's progress can be measured in both financial and league table terms. The
contribution of foreign operations, of which London is the largest
component, was 5 per cent 10 years ago, 20 per cent last year and 40 per
cent so far this year. With domestic banking under pressure, the growing
contribution of institutional banking operations outside Switzerland 'has
come at the right time', says Mr Muller.
In debt underwriting, UBS ranked sixth in the first six months of this year,
according to IFR Securities Data. Even more impressive, UBS ranked second in
Acquisitions Monthly's league table of advisers on European cross-border
acquisitions completed in the year to June. However, its ranking in the
syndicated loans market has slipped to 12th, according to IFR.
'In looking at our results in the last two years, a lot of money has come
from traditional products, such as equities and gilts,' says Mr Muller. He
says that equities have been consistently profitable since 1991. However,
this year it is the merged debt/treasury operation which has been the 'star
performer. This has been the big break-through'.
In retrospect, Mr Muller admits that mistakes were made on the way. 'It's a
bit delicate. If we were today to take over an organisation like P&amp;D, we
would most certainly take over the management straight away.'
Back in 1985, when the bank already had two London operations, UBS
Securities and a bank branch, the decision was taken to 'let the three units
(including P&amp;D) run in parallel for a few years, to see how things would
develop after Big Bang.'
As it turned out, the changes brought about by the Big Bang were more
dramatic than had been foreseen. 'The business changed so fundamentally that
P&amp;D got into some difficulty with back office administration. They were not
able to cope with the new environment.'
Then came 1987, a bad year for many financial institutions but a black time
for UBS, which, on top of the stock market crash, was caught up in financial
scandal over the Blue Arrow rights issue. 'It cost a lot of money and took a
lot of time,' says Mr Muller. At the end of that year, he was given the task
of reining in the three businesses, scattered among 11 locations around
London, and of bringing the administrative side of P&amp;D under control.
Finally, early in 1989, UBS Phillips and Drew was formed, and the firm moved
into Broadgate, the modern City office complex. 'Moving all the units
together created the cornerstone of success,' he says.
While the London operation may have come right in the end, other foreign
bankers in London find it hard to be benevolent, well aware that they would
never have been given the same leeway as Mr Muller by their parent bank, and
some remain sceptical.
While UBS as a whole exceeded its 10 per cent target for return on equity in
the first half, they suggest that London's strong performance would have to
persist for some time for UBS to recoup its investment in the business.
Mr Muller, for his part, acknowledges the support of head office. 'Without
total support from Zurich we would never have been able to do it,' he says.
UBS bought in top professionals from prominent London firms. In addition, a
'totally different' top management team was put in place.
'It needed a change: I felt that to be able to go through a fundamental
reorganisation we needed new expertise,' he says.
This has sometimes created the impression that the doors at UBS are
constantly revolving. 'They have hired some good people, but they have lost
some extremely good people too,' says one former staffer.
Are the improved profits from UBS's London operations the result of markets
or management? The answer, from analysts and insiders, appears to be that it
is a bit of both.
'They had to do a lot of changing around and a lot of spending, but that is
telling now,' says Mr Ian Poulter, a banking analyst at Yamaichi
International. But he adds that he wants to see whether these sort of
results can be maintained.
'Historically, UBS has a habit of doing very well in good markets, and of
not turning around fast enough in bad markets,' said one former UBS banker.
Mr Muller admits that the bank may have entered some markets, such as
derivatives, rather late.
'We Swiss bankers have some advantages and some disadvantages,' he explains.
One advantage, clearly, is staying power.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Court deals blow to Japanese
shareholders
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S shareholders' rights movement suffered a setback yesterday when the
Tokyo District Court ruled that the directors of Nomura Securities were not
required to reimburse the securities house for losses incurred in
compensating favoured corporate clients for stock investment losses.
The ruling, which comes amid a growing debate on shareholders' rights,
followed an unusual damages claim by an individual investor, Mr Yoshinori
Ikenaka of Osaka, who wanted the 14 directors to pay Nomura Y100m (Dollars
943,300) for approving Y362m in compensation to Tokyo Broadcasting System
(TBS) for stock losses in 1990.
Japanese courts are generally reluctant to set clear precedents, though the
decision yesterday was welcomed by Japanese firms fearing a rush of new
litigation after changes to the Commercial Code in June eased filing
requirements for shareholder litigants.
In the case of Nomura, Japan's biggest securities house, Judge Yoshihiro
Katayama ruled that the former board did not necessarily act against
shareholder interests in compensating TBS for its losses, as the board had
wanted to secure the broker's long-term relationship with the broadcasting
company.
Judge Katayama said the decision to compensate did not involve a breach of
the directors' powers of discretion when the circumstances of the period, in
particular the market crash, were taken into account. He said shareholders
had profited from business with TBS after it was compensated. But the judge
said loss compensation by Japanese brokers, common after the crash, should
be criticised as it undermined public confidence in the fairness of
securities markets and was an apparent violation of the anti-monopoly law.
Nomura said the court's decision reflected judicial awareness of the
importance of long-term links between Japanese companies, though the broker
suggested that shareholders' rights will not be hindered by the ruling.
Japanese brokers have generally supported the campaign for improved
shareholders' rights, believing that investor confidence in the stock market
has been damaged by a series of broker scandals, including loss compensation
and links to gangster groups.
Earlier this month, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that six former
executives of Mitsui Mining must pay Y100m in compensation to the company
for manipulating its share price. After that decision, Japanese lawyers said
the case appeared to be an exception.
They said the stock manipulation was blatant in the Mitsui Mining case and
the ruling would not necessarily influence other actions based on
allegations that directors had been incompetent or negligent.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has imposed fines of Y5m each on three Japanese
securities houses, Daiwa Securities, Yamaichi Securities and Universal
Securities, Reuter reports. The exchange said it had fined Daiwa for its
compensation of a client in May-July 1991. Daiwa made up for the client's
investment losses worth Y130m. Earlier this year Yamaichi and Universal ran
into trouble in connection with the illegal manipulation of shares.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Anglovaal lifts dividend by 5%

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLOVAAL, the South African mining and industrial group, reported improved
profits for the year ended June, and is increasing its dividend to 105 cents
a share from 100 cents. Net earnings rose by 6 per cent to R293.1m (Dollars
86.2m), due mostly to a strong performance from the industrial operations.
The group forecast a further improvement in profits for this year.
Anglovaal is one of South Africa's six big mining houses, but 69 per cent of
earnings last year came from industrial operations - Anglovaal Industries -
where the performance was boosted by lower tax and a full year's
contribution from the Anglo-Alpha cement arm. Income from the group's main
direct mining investments - gold, copper and manganese - fell by 20 per cent
to R37.9m. Income from indirect mining investments rose marginally to R34.2m
from R29.6m.
Financial earnings were substantially lower - down to R17.9m from R29.6m -
as a result of lower cash holdings and falling interest rates.
Earnings were also affected by the troubles at the Crusader Life insurance
company. Provisions have been made for potential losses in this area.
Group turnover rose by 4 per cent to R8.5bn but pressure on margins saw
operating profit fall by 4 per cent to R719.5m from R747.8m.
The rise in attributable profit was the result of a lower tax bill and an
increase in equity accounted earnings.

MANDARIN Oriental, the Jardine Matheson group's Hong Kong-based luxury hotel
company, yesterday announced a 2 per cent increase in profit attributable to
shareholders of USDollars 19.5m for the six months ended June, up from
USDollars 19.2m a year earlier.
The results were below expectations, primarily due to the further decline in
earnings from the 45 per cent owned Oriental hotel in Bangkok, and a weak
performance from the group's hotel interests in Macau, where there has been
a substantial increase in the supply of luxury hotel rooms over the past
year.
Group turnover increased 7.7 per cent to USDollars 78.1m at the interim
stage, and operating profit recorded a 16 per cent increase, due to improved
performances from the two wholly-owned properties in Hong Kong  - the
Mandarin and the Excelsior - and from its hotel in Manila.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'In the first half of the year, the
group's strong performance in Hong Kong was largely offset by weakness in
most of our other markets. If the same trend continues, the results for the
full year are expected to remain little changed (from 1992).'
The interim dividend is being held at USDollars 1.41 a share.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Irregular forex deals hit Nippon
Steel unit

NIPPON Steel Chemical, a chemicals subsidiary of Nippon Steel, the world's
largest steel maker, yesterday forecast a pre-tax loss of Y12bn (Dollars
113.2m) for the year ending March, following foreign exchange losses on
unauthorised trading by an accounting division chief.
The company had previously forecast a loss of Y3.8bn, but the continued
slowing of domestic industrial demand for resins and composite materials has
added to damage caused by the foreign exchange losses, estimated at Y14.2bn.
These losses arose from irregular deals by the head of the company's forex
division, who died in a train accident in May.
He had invested Y47.3bn in forward contracts, apparently breaching a company
rule that currency investments of more than Y100m require board approval.
Nippon Steel Chemical intends to cover the foreign exchange losses through
the sale of securities and land holdings, but it also plans to transfer 200
head office staff to subsidiaries in an attempt to reduce costs.
The company will not pay an interim dividend.
Sales for the year are expected to be Y270bn, down from the previous
estimate of Y290bn, and from last year's Y281.5bn, when the company had a
pre-tax loss of Y7.2bn and a net loss of Y6.3bn.
For the first half to September, Nippon Steel Chemical forecast sales of
Y130bn, down from Y138bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y8bn, widening from Y3.5bn.
In the same period last year, the company lost Y988m.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Turner seeks deal with France
over TV network

MR TED TURNER, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System, said yesterday he was
seeking a compromise with France in a row over US programme content of his
new satellite television network.
France has blocked reception of the TNT/cartoon network, launched in Europe
today, on domestic cable networks.
The network, carried on the Astra satellite system, runs cartoons from 6am
to 6pm and mainly old films from the MGM library during the rest of the day.
French opposition to the network is based on EC rules which say that where
practicable there should be a minimum of 51 per cent European production in
satellite television channels.
The French government would also like to see trade in cultural products
raised in the Gatt trade talks.
Mr Turner said yesterday: 'The French have their own way of doing things and
they are entitled to do it.'
The founder of Cable News Network, the 24-hours-a-day television news
service, added: 'We are trying to be good guys and to sit down and try to
see if some kind of compromise can be reached.'
Mr Turner has called for a study of European content in the TNT film channel
and found that a number of the library films were shot in the UK. Other
films have involved European co-producers. Mr Turner said yesterday he
estimated that as much as 30 per cent of TNT was either made in Europe or
had European co-production links.
The TNT/cartoon network, which is freely available across Europe to those
with satellite television equipment, has already been given a licence by the
Independent Television Commission in the UK.
Under EC regulations, if a television channel is licensed in any EC country
that usually means it should be freely available throughout the Community.
The row intensified yesterday as Belgium joined France in banning the
channel from its cable television network on the grounds that it did not
have enough European content.

LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the French group with interests in several UK
water companies, will gain a strong minority position in the second-largest
investor-owned water concern in the US as a result of a Dollars 200m
takeover announced yesterday.
In a cash-and-stock deal supported by Lyonnaise, United Water Resources,
which supplies about 235,000 customers in northern New Jersey and southern
New York, agreed to acquire GWC, which serves nearly 300,000 customers in 14
states.
Lyonnaise, which currently owns 82 per cent of GWC, would hold a 26 per cent
stake in the newly formed group, with a combined annual turnover of about
Dollars 250m. Under the agreement the French company would gain four seats
on United's board, which would expand from 11 to 15 seats.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS Inc, the largest cable television systems operator in the
US, and Germany's Bertelsmann music and entertainment group yesterday
announced plans for a new interactive cable channel which will allow viewers
to choose the pop videos they want to watch, as well as buying music-related
products from home.
The new channel, claimed to be the first of its kind, is an early example of
the kind of service which US media companies hope will lead to a boom in
inter-active, multi-media entertainment in the home.
The two companies are forming a 50-50 joint venture to develop the channel,
which they hope to roll out across the US over the next 12 months.
TCI said that initially customers would have to use a telephone to order
selections but that in two to three years' time new technology should allow
them to do so using a remote control device.
Bertelsmann is one of the world's leading record companies, with labels
which include Arista Records and RCA Records. However, it said yesterday it
hoped that the channel would also involve labels owned by other record
companies. The channel will be offered to leading US cable operators in
addition to TCI.
Bertelsmann said the channel would be supported by advertising and would
include home shopping.
Some of the most successful US cable television channels focus on pop music.
They include MTV, which mainly broadcasts pop videos and is rapidly
spreading around the globe, and Country Music Television, which concentrates
on country music videos and is one of the fastest-growing channels in
America. However, the existing channels are not inter-active.
Mr Fred Vierra, head of worldwide programming for TCI, said the new network
marked 'the beginning of music made popular by consumer choice'.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Falling bond market brings
party-time for lenders - US mortgage borrowers are taking advantage of
interest rates at historic lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US financial industry is bracing itself for a record-breaking wave of
refinancings by mortgage borrowers, prompted by falling long-term interest
rates. The result: a boom for companies that generate new mortgage loans,
but bad news for those that service them and for the many investors in
mortgage-backed bonds who are seeing their investment returns reduced.
The bull market in bonds that has driven domestic mortgage rates down to
historic lows, along with other long-term interest rates, has prompted
previous waves of mortgage refinancings in the past two years, but none as
big as the one that is now washing over the financial sector. As mortgage
rates fall, many borrowers pay off their old fixed-rate loans by taking out
new, lower-interest ones. Around four-fifths of the Dollars 3,000bn of home
mortgage loans in the US are on fixed rates.
The surge in mortgage pre-payments is reflected in the refinancing index
constructed by the Mortgage Bankers Association. This leapt to two peaks in
1992 and a third in March of this year, as investors reacted to sharp falls
in long-term rates. Its latest jump, as the yield on the 30-Treasury bond
has fallen below 6 per cent, is the biggest yet. The index (at 100 in March
1990) climbed above 1500 for the first time at the beginning of this month,
reaching 1731 in the latest figure released yesterday. Last year, Dollars
450bn of mortgage loans were refinanced. This year, the figure is set to top
Dollars 500bn.
Only homeowners unlucky enough to have been left with properties worth less
than their loans (an experience generally confined to California and the
north-east) have been unable to join in the party.
New mortgages mean new fees for lenders. Most charge a fee of 1.25 to 1.5
per cent when making a loan, whether it is taken out to repay an old loan or
to buy a house. Fee income at Countrywide Credit Industries, the US's
biggest home mortgage company, leapt from Dollars 38m to Dollars 92m in
1992.
However, falling mortgage interest rates have also hit the results of some
banks. Most recycle their mortgages as mortgage-backed bonds, and retain an
involvement only in servicing the loans - for a fee. That gives servicing
rights a value, and has led to a market in which some banks have become big
buyers of the rights to service portfolios of mortgages. If those mortgages
are repaid early, the value of the portfolio falls.
This cost Citibank Dollars 255m last year. 'When it hit, it hit hard and
unexpectedly,' said Mr Pei-Yuan Chia, senior vice-president in charge of
Citibank's consumer banking business. 'All the mortgage banks are looking at
(the implications of refinancings) at the moment,' he says.
The cost to the banks this year may turn out to be lower than in 1992. Citi,
for one, says it now hedges against impairments to its mortgage portfolio in
the Treasury bond market: if rates fall and refinancings rise, the costs are
balanced by profits on the bond holdings.
The refinancing boom has also been bad news for investors who hold the
near-Dollars 1,500bn of mortgage-backed bonds in issue. Most new mortgages
are not held on bank's balance sheets: they are eventually repackaged and
sold to investors. Since many of these bonds are recycled through Fannie Mae
and carry a federal guarantee, they are relatively free from credit risk.
Prepayment risk is something else. As interest rates fall and the loans
backing the bonds are repaid, investors are left to reinvest their capital
in bonds at much lower yields. As a result, mortgage-backed bonds
under-perform other fixed-income securities during a bond market rally.
That has been especially true in recent weeks as investors have reassessed
the prepayment risk. 'The market has gone through a pretty enormous
revaluation in the last month,' says Mr Christopher Flanagan, director of
mortgage-backed research at Merrill Lynch. Current-coupon mortgage-backed
bonds (those which pay an annual return close to current bond market yields)
now yield around 100 basis points (one percentage point) more than
comparable US Treasury bonds, up from less than 80 basis points in the
middle of August.
The picture is even worse for bonds issued before the latest rally, which
pay higher coupons and are the most in danger of being repaid early. 'Price
spreads have collapsed in the last two or three weeks,' Mr Flanagan says.
Worst hit of all have been interest-only 'strips' - the future income
streams on mortgage-backed bonds which are detached and sold separately. As
the mortgages are repaid, these future income payments simply vanish.
The readjustment in the bond market is partly due to the faster pace of
refinancings, which are running at a far higher level than in 1986 and early
1987, when mortgage rates last fell sharply. Mr Mark Obrinsky, senior
economist at Fannie Mae, says the rate has picked up in part because most
lenders are now prepared to roll their refinancing fees into the balance of
the new loans. Also, he says, 'it's like going to the dentist': the many
borrowers who have refinanced once already in recent years have less
resistance to doing it again.
The fact that it now takes a smaller fall in interest rates to produce a
larger volume of refinancing has blown a hole in the financial models used
by traders of strips and other derivative-type instruments. The pricing and
hedging strategies based on outdated assumptions about refinancing rates
have not held up well in the current boom.
While it is hurting bondholders, the latest refinancing wave could help to
lift the average homeowner's disposable income - and, by implication, the
sluggish US economy. By locking into lower interest rates on Dollars 500bn
or more of their household debt, Ameri-cans are freeing themselves to spend
more in the shops.
The benefits will not all flow through at once, though. Many homeowners are
taking advantage of lower interest rates to shorten the length of their
debt. According to Fannie Mae, two out of every five people who refinanced a
30-year mortgage in the first half of this year chose to replace it with a
15-year one instead. As a result, their monthly interest payments may
actually have risen, not fallen.

GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which has been shrinking through
the sale of large parts of its business, announced plans to distribute
Dollars 372m, or Dollars 12 a share, of the disposal proceeds to its
shareholders - the third such cash disbursement this year.
General Dynamics said that the total represented substantially all of the
cash available for tax-advantaged distribution from sales of businesses to
date. The company paid out Dollars 20 a share in April and Dollars 18 a
share in July.
The latest distribution will be made on October 12 to shareholders of record
on September 28.
The company also increased its quarterly dividend by 50 per cent to 60 cents
a share, reflecting the board's confidence in the stability of its strong
cash flows.

MAGNA International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, reported
a 26 per cent gain in fourth-quarter profits but warned that margins are
being affected by customer pricing pressures.
Net profit for the three months to July 31 was CDollars 39.6m (Dollars 30m),
or 70 cents a share, up from CDollars 31.3m, or 61 cents, a year earlier.
Sales were CDollars 649m against CDollars 625m.
Earnings for fiscal 1993 were CDollars 140.4m, or CDollars 2.55, up 43 per
cent from CDollars 98m, or CDollars 2.08, on sales of CDollars 2.6bn against
CDollars 2.35bn.
Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor had higher profits for the
second quarter and half-year before special items, helped by gains in
efficiency and a 1992 acquisition.
But the northern California subsidiary continued to lose.
For the three months ended August 14 net profit was CDollars 11.5m, or 11
cents a share, against CDollars 3.8m, or 3 cents, a year earlier on sales of
CDollars 1.9bn, against CDollars 2.1bn. The volume decline was due to an
asset sale. After special items profit equalled 11 cents a share against 21
cents.
First-half profit after special items was CDollars 15m, or 13 cents, against
CDollars 24.5m, or 26 cents. Sales were CDollars 3.3bn against CDollars
3.6bn.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Snia BPD increases sales by 7.6%
at halfway stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SNIA BPD, the quoted chemicals, fibres and industrial company controlled by
Italy's Fiat group, raised consolidated sales by 7.6 per cent to L1,146bn
(Dollars 746m) in the first half of this year.
Group earnings before tax and minority interests recovered strongly to
L12bn, against a L14bn loss in the corresponding period last year.
The improvement was prompted partly by a sharp fall in group debts, which
were reduced to L380bn from L767bn at the end of last year. The cut in
borrowings came largely from the sale of Snia BPD's space and rocket
technology business, which raised L260bn, and the disposal of some
bio-engineering businesses for more than L137bn.
The company warned that earnings would remain overshadowed by the recession,
but said the restructuring and sale of some businesses left it better placed
to benefit from any signs of recovery.
Italmobiliare, the holding company which controls Italcementi, one of the
world's biggest cement groups, is planning capital increases which should
raise about L260bn.
The highly complex deal involves a rights issue of new ordinary and savings
shares combined with warrants to buy new equity, and a bond issue
convertible into new non-voting savings stock.

bid

THYSSEN and Preussag, Germany's steel manufacturers, have stepped up their
efforts to buy Ekostahl, the lossmaking east German steel mill.
The companies launched a new proposal which, for the first time, includes an
offer to inject cash into the struggling steel group.
The move is aimed at stemming competition in the region, and blocking
Ekostahl's purchase by Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel maker.
Thyssen and Preussag are offering initially to buy 50 per cent of Ekostahl's
cold-rolling mill and close down the hot-blast furnace within the next three
years.
They want the Treuhand, the state agency in charge of privatisation, to take
absorb any losses during the restructuring period.
The consortium is also offering to create 1,000 new jobs in Eisenhuttenstadt
through its subsidiaries.
These would include recycling and construction. The moves might offset
lay-offs of about 1,600 at Ekostahl itself.
The German offer coincides with growing pressure on Bonn from the European
Commission to privatise Ekostahl as quickly as possible.
The privatisation of the east German plant at Eisenhuttenstadt would allow
the Commission to move forward in its negotiations with state-owned
producers in Spain and Italy aimed at reducing state subsidies and cutting
overcapacity.
After talks in Brussels earlier this week, Mr Gunther Rexrodt, Germany's
economy minister, yesterday told the country's steel industry to speed up
the privatisation of Ekostahl.
However, a Treuhand official said that it was still not clear 'how serious'
Thyssen and Preussag were in saving Ekostahl from closure in the long term.
The official added that the latest plan was 'more concrete' than those
presented during the summer, which had primarily focused on offering
management expertise.
Ekostahl's annual production has already been reduced from 2.5m tons to
900,000 tons.
The labour force has been cut from 12,000 to 3,500 full-time employees.
However, the Treuhand said that negotiations with Riva were progressing and
the Italian group was interested in acquiring a majority stake, as well as
turning Ekostahl into a competitive mini-mill.

COMPANHIA Portuguesa Radio Marconi, the Portuguese government-controlled
telecoms group, yesterday reported net profits for the first half of 1993 of
Esc2bn (Dollars 12.2m), an 11 per cent increase compared with the same
period last year.
Operating profits grew by 14 per cent to Esc3.7bn and cash flow increased by
12 per cent to Esc4.5bn.
Mr Goncalo Sequeira Braga, Marconi's president, said the results showed a
strengthening in the company's financial structure in terms of solidity,
autonomy and solvency.
He also reported a significant reduction in indebtedness and an important
increase in capital to Esc43bn, compared with Esc37bn the previous year.
Portugal's telecoms sector is undergoing an important restructuring, with
two wholly state-owned companies and Marconi, which is 49 per cent
privately-owned, being brought together under a single government-controlled
holding company, Comunicacoes Nacionais.
Marconi has a licence to operate intercontinental calls to and from
Portugal, but is also bidding for a concession to operate inter-European
services.
The company forecasts that net profits will exceed Esc4bn for all of 1993,
an increase of 15 per cent on 1992.

OLIVETTI, the Italian computer group due to report first-half results next
week, hopes to break into Italy's buoyant mobile telecommunications market.
The Italian market is Europe's second biggest after the UK, with more than
900,000 subscribers.
Mr Corrado Passera, joint managing director, asked the government to respect
a European Community deadline to name a second operator for the GSM network
by early 1993.
Olivetti is one of three consortia bidding for the licence. Although rivals
include Fiat and Pacific Telesis of the US, Mr Passera said he thought
Olivetti was best placed to win. 'Information technology and communications
are drawing steadily closer. Giving us the licence would help lift Olivetti
into the first tier of companies combining computers and
telecommunications,' he said.
Mr Passera said Olivetti already had a nationwide sales and service network,
so any additional investment for cellular communications would be
'reasonable'. He would not predict what impact winning the licence might
have on profits, but said Olivetti's combination of information technology
and communications would expand the Italian market.
Olivetti, which made a L649.9bn (Dollars 423m) net loss last year, is
expected to announce a further heavy loss for the first half of this year
when it reports next Friday.
However, while this year's first-half loss may be appreciably higher than
the L93.4bn lost in first six months of 1992, analysts believe the results
will show the group has contained the severe earnings slump suffered during
the second half of last year.
Group sales are expected to rise by more than 5 per cent. Although the value
of sales outside Italy will be inflated by the lower lira, analysts believe
the depreciation has pushed up costs owing to higher component prices.
Forecasts for the full-year results predict a net loss of more than L400bn,
prior to breaking even in 1994.

VOLKSWAGEN yesterday cancelled a complex DM1.4bn (Dollars 879m) investment
financing package for Skoda, its Czech subsidiary, hours before the deal was
due to be signed in London today.
The move, which threatens to bring VW into conflict with the international
banking community and worsen already-strained relations with the government
of the Czech Republic, highlighted the intensity of the scramble to cut
costs at the beleaguered automotive group.
The package, negotiated with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, and a
private banking consortium led by Dresdner Bank, was no longer needed, VW
said.
The participating banks, stunned by the news, offered no comment, but were
hoping for a full explanation over dinner at the Mirabelle restaurant in
London last night, arranged by Dresdner Bank and intended to celebrate the
signing.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, was understood to be attending. He is
believed to have telephoned Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister,
yesterday to assure him that VW's commitment to Skoda remained unaltered.
It was not clear if the VW supervisory board, which must usually be
consulted on important investment decisions, had been informed.
'It was an honest step, even though it was taken at short notice,' said Mr
Otto Ferdinand Wachs, a group spokesman. The company could have signed and
then cancelled it, he added.
He credited Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's controversial new
production director, with improvements to manufacturing processes which had
helped make the loan unnecessary.
'This is a positive move which will improve profitability both at Skoda and
group level,' Mr Wachs added.
Interim results of an investment review, due to be considered by the
company's supervisory board in November, showed that productivity
improvements at Skoda meant investment requirements would be 'considerably
lower' than thought, the company said in a statement.
Under current plans VW was expecting to spend a total of DM7bn at Skoda this
decade, it added. It is understood that only around DM500m has been paid out
this year. The planned total has been cut to around DM4bn.
Volkswagen is already embroiled in a row with the Prague government which
blew up last month when it announced an 8 per cent increase in Skoda prices
in the Czech market and suggested it might import component supplies because
of rising local costs.
The prices of some Skoda models in the Czech republic are now around double
the levels of three years ago, before VW took control.

Hungarian state sale

HUNGARY'S privatisation authority is striking Magyar Paribas, the local
subsidiary of France's Paribas, off its list of advisers.
Mr Lajos Csepi, managing director of Hungary's State Property Agency (SPA),
claimed yesterday that Paribas had made 'big mistakes' as consultant on the
privatisation of Pannon Suto, a bakery.
The SPA's clash with Paribas is the latest in a series of disputes between
the Hungarian authorities and western advisers. 'This is just the same game
they played with BZW,' said Mr Peter Medgyessy, director-general of Magyar
Paribas.
The SPA sacked the UK's Barclays de Zoete Wedd as adviser on the
privatisation of Kobanyai Sorgyar, Hungary's largest brewery, in November
1992. The SPA claimed, and BZW denied, that the UK bank had ignored
instructions.
More recently, Hungary's State Audit Office attacked the handling by
London-based Morgan Grenfell of the sale of Allami Biztosito, the
state-owned insurer, to Aegon of the Netherlands.
The underlying charge against Paribas is that it should have stopped
managers of Pannon Suto siphoning off the company's assets into their own
private company.
Magyar Paribas said it was 'absolutely innocent' and found the SPA's actions
inexplicable. 'I simply don't understand,' said Mr Medgyessy.
Pannon Suto is included in Hungary's decentralised 'self-privatisation'
programme, in which advisers are given extra freedom to set the terms for
disposal with a minimum of state intervention.
Confusion surrounds the decision to exclude Paribas, which is uncertain
about the extent of the ban. It is unclear whether the SPA had excluded
Magyar Paribas just from Pannon Suto's sale, from participation in the
self-privatisation programme, or from all privatisation work with the
agency.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Two Japanese trust banks
establish securities units
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Trust and Banking and Sumitomo Trust and Banking, the Japanese
trust banks, yesterday took advantage of the country's financial
deregulation to establish securities subsidiaries.
Japan's five other trust banks are either planning new securities arms or
have shelved plans to establish new companies. This highlights the effects
on the banking industry of reduced asset values and the upsurge in
non-performing loans.
Three banks said yesterday that securities subsidiaries were 'under
consideration'. Toyo Trust and Banking said it had other priorities,
including dealing with non-performing loans. Nippon Trust Bank said it had
no plans to enter the securities business.
Before the collapse of Tokyo stock prices and the downturn in trading
volume, most Japanese banks had welcomed the opportunity to enter the
securities business provided by the Financial System Reform Act, effective
from April this year.
The entry of the two trust banks follows the opening of securities units in
July by two long-term credit banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan and the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and by Norinchukin, the central agricultural
bank.
However, the banks are strictly limited in the services they can offer. They
can underwrite and trade in straight bonds, but only underwrite convertible
bonds and warrant bonds, while they are excluded from the stock market.
Both Mitsubishi Trust and Sumitomo Trust will capitalise their subsidiaries,
Mitsubishi TB Securities and STB Securities, at Y20bn (Dollars 188m). The
former will have 35 staff, rising to 65 next year, and the latter will begin
operations with 38 staff.
Mitsubishi Trust intends to concentrate on dealing in Japanese government
and corporate bonds, but will review the operations if the Ministry of
Finance further relaxes the limits on the subsidiaries' dealings in the next
two or three years.
The ministry has indicated that the restrictions will be gradually relaxed,
but the timing will depend on the health of existing Japanese brokers, which
oppose the banks' entry into the stock market.

FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Profits at Union Miniere decline
46%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Miniere, the Belgian metals group, yesterday forecast a difficult
second half after announcing a 46 per cent fall in operating profits for the
first six months of 1993.
Consolidated operating profits fell to BFr478m (Dollars 14m) from BFr894m
for the six-month period, but the group said it was pleased to have recorded
a positive result in spite of 'an extremely unfavourable economic
environment'.
The company attributed its resilience to costly rationalisation measures
taken over the last two years, but a spokesman warned that operating results
in the second half would be even worse than in the first six months.
The group managed to reduce its share of losses after tax to BFr860m,
compared with a loss of BFr1.39bn in the first half of last year, when the
results were dragged down by extraordinary restructuring charges of
BFr1.49bn.
In the first half of 1993, the extraordinary loss was BFr243m, including the
BFr176m cost of nearly 600 redundancies. The same number of jobs is likely
to be cut from the company's 13,400 workforce in the second half.
Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, owns 75 per
cent of Union Miniere, an investment which represents about 20.5 per cent of
the holding company's portfolio.
La Generale said yesterday that it was still seeking an industrial partner
for Union Miniere to help reduce the holding company's exposure to the
cyclical industrial sector.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KREDIETBANK, one of Belgium's biggest private banks, increased net
consolidated profit to BFr4.96bn (Dollars 145m) in the first half of 1993.
The group said profits had risen by 17 per cent from the BFr4.2bn of net
profits calculated for the equivalent period. Direct comparison was not
possible because of the change in Kredietbank's year-end in 1992.
The group forecast full-year profit 'in line with the trend of the past
years', during which it has recorded average annual increases of 13 per
cent. In 1992, group profits rose by 14.3 per cent to BFr8.47bn, restated
for a full year.
The group is to pay an additional non-recurring net interim dividend of
BFr90 per share next month, linked to the change in the year end.
Kredietbank said the strong increase in profit in the first half was due to
a 'sharp expansion in activity', improved control over costs, and better
risk management.
The group's balance sheet total, for example, has risen by 7.8 per cent
since the end of December 1992, from BFr2,279bn to BFr2,458bn. At the same
time, current operating costs have risen only 3.2 per cent, while the ratio
of costs to gross income has come down from 58.4 per cent at the end of 1992
to 55.1 per cent.
Profit before tax rose by 32 per cent to BFr7.98bn in the first half, but
the elimination of a number of tax-deductible losses, particularly on bad
debts to 'problem countries', led to a strong rise in taxation.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (13): Power
to a UK-US elbow - Judy Dempsey examines a deal in eastern Germany's
utilities sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER nearly 18 months of negotiations, an Anglo-American consortium headed
by Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Massachusetts, and Morrison-Knudsen of Idaho
will soon sign an important contract which will give it a foothold in
eastern Germany's highly regulated utilities sector.
The consortium will buy Mitteldeutschen Braunkohle AG (Mibrag), the giant
brown coal fields which straddle the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt.
These fields are expected to produce between 15m and 20m metric tons of
lignite a year.
The Anglo-Americans are also buying a 44 per cent stake in a power
generating plant at Schkopau, near Halle, Saxony-Anhalt's second largest
city. The Schkopau plant has a capacity of 900MW. The consortium will buy
the equivalent of 400MW.
Outsiders may well ask why the Anglo-Americans should at all be interested
in acquiring notoriously dirty brown coal fields, as well as a power plant -
particularly since eastern German industry has almost collapsed, with the
inevitable consequence of a sharp drop in energy consumption.
The answer is that by acquiring Mibrag and Schkopau, the consortium will tap
into eastern Germany's utility sector, and will be well placed to expand
eastwards, into eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Reaching this stage of the negotiations was extremely difficult. From the
beginning, the consortium was restricted in its activities in eastern
Germany by the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract. This contract was
signed in August 1990 between Vereinigte Energiewerke AG, or Veag, eastern
Germany's major utility, and western Germany's eight main major utility
companies.
Under the terms of the Stromvertrag, the latter gained a monopoly over Veag,
which also controls the high voltage grid throughout eastern Germany. At the
same time, the contract insisted that eastern Germany's own 15 utility
companies must buy 70 per cent of its energy from Veag as a means of
underwriting the massive investments which western Germany's utilities would
undertake in eastern Germany. These include building, upgrading, or
modernising the region's power generating blocks; by the year 2010 these
will have a capacity of over 12,000MW.
The consortium tried to find a way round the Stromvertrag through the
Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring eastern
German industry. Because the Anglo-Americans could not buy directly into
power generation in eastern Germany (it could not - at least in the early
stages - be guaranteed any access to the grid, without which it could not
sell its energy), it decided to bid for Mibrag in return for gaining some
access to power generation.
This suited the Treuhand. It wanted an investor which would save Mibrag,
guarantee several thousand jobs and commit large investments. The consortium
is expected to pay about DM700m for Mibrag. For its part, the consortium was
determined to link its purchase of Mibrag with access to power generation.
After long and protracted negotiations in Berlin, the Anglo-Americans are
set to sign a mining contract, and to pay DM800m for its 44 per cent stake
in a power generating plant.
The success of these acquisitions, however, depends on two crucial factors:
the development of the east German economy; and the willingness by Veag, or
any of the eight west German utilities, to give the consortium greater
access to power generation. After all, the interests of PowerGen and NRG do
not rest with mining. They are concentrated on power generation. Initially,
the consortium had wanted access to 900MW of generation in eastern Germany.
It has had to settle for Schkopau's 400MW - for the moment.
Mibrag has guaranteed coal contracts in place already. Over the next 40
years it will supply about 10m tons of coal to Lippendorf, a large power
generation plant in Saxony-Anhalt, and to nearby Schkopau, thus giving the
mines a secure economic base.
Schkopau's energy will be sold to the railways, local domestic heating
systems, and Buna, the large chemical plant which the Treuhand plans to
privatise. However, increased profitability and turnover of both Mibrag and
Schkopau will partly depend on the future development of Buna, and Leuna, an
oil refinery plant partly owned by Elf Acquitaine, the French petro-chemical
company.
If the Treuhand comes up with a viable plan for Buna, and if Leuna will
expand, it is expected that both will require more energy. The consortium is
thus well placed to meet these needs, through producing more coal at Mibrag,
building an additional plant at Schkopau, or building a power generation
plant near Leuna.
In addition, if the Mibrag fields can be shown to be run efficiently and
profitably, there is every likelihood that the consortium will be in a
strong position to sell a share to any of western Germany's eight utilities.
In other words, if Mibrag was opened up to west German participation, there
is every likelihood that this would increase the consortium's access to Veag
and the high voltage grid which is monopolised by these eight utility
companies.
The acquisition by PowerGen and NRG of Mibrag and Schkopau represents the
beginning of the consortium's activities, not only in eastern Germany, but
in eastern Europe as well. The battle to open up eastern Germany's utilities
sector might have been long and difficult. But the prize, over the next
decade, is expected to compensate - more than compensate - for those tough
negotiations.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (12): More
talk than action in business - A German investment banking life is not a
happy one at present
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE there too many foreign investment bankers in Germany?
One banker, who for understandable reasons wants to remain anonymous, thinks
that there are.
'Germany is teeming with investment bankers beating their breasts in search
of business which just isn't there,' he observes. 'They talk about the
business out there waiting to be done, they get highly-paid jobs on the
basis of the business they are going to do . . . but I doubt whether they
really do enough to justify their overheads.
'The thing is that the investment banker here does not have the comfortable
role he enjoys in the UK or the US. German companies see almost no reason
for using them - and why should they?
'It makes sense to use a foreign investment bank when you are trying to sell
a company to a foreign buyer, but that is about it in terms of conventional
M&amp;A business. Nowadays it is difficult to persuade a German company to use a
foreign investment bank as anything other than a broker for selling troubled
subsidiaries.'
Is this bleak assessment correct?
Certainly, the investment banker's lot in Germany is a poor one amid
Germany's worst recession since the second world war. According to
statistics complied by the German arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy
firm, the number of transactions in Germany last year fell by 12 per cent to
2,559 - the lowest level for five years.
Among these there were a handful of spectacular cross-border deals, such as
the complicated joint transactions which led to Credit Lyonnais' purchase of
a majority stake in the BfG Bank for a total package of an estimated
DM1.5bn. The related transaction was Assurances Generales de France's
acquisition of a large holding in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB),
Germany's second largest insurance group.
Westdeutsche Landesbank, the state sector bank, bought Thomas Cook, the
UK-based travel group (for around DM600m); Schering, the Berlin-based group
sold its industrial chemicals division to Witco of the US for DM660.
The bulk of M&amp;A transactions involved smaller, privately owned companies, as
is usual for the German market for corporate control. Moreover, most of
these deals were done without the help of Anglo-American-style financial
advisers. German companies tend to turn to their house-bank or to tax, legal
and accountancy advisers for many of the services provided by investment
banks in the 'Anglo-Saxon' markets.
And for those investment banks lucky enough to have won a mandate, there
comes another problem: the Coopers study found that the quality of the
market had changed perceptibly. It is no longer a seller's market.
'In the light of current economic climate many of the previously active
acquirers have entered a period of consolidation,' the study observes. 'On
the seller's side the search for a suitable buyer is often a fruitless one.'
'It is quite difficult to get deals done in these sort of circumstances,'
confirms Peter Espenhahn, deputy-head of corporate finance at Morgan
Grenfell, the UK merchant bank which is a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank,
Germany's biggest bank, and a director of the bank's German operations .
'There tends to be a large gap between the expectations of buyer and seller.
Selling companies at a time of declining fortunes is always difficult.'
Mr Piers von Simson, head of European mergers and acquisitions at S G
Warburg, says that his team of eight professionals working in the
German-speaking countries has 'got its hands full', for example, advising
PowerGen of the UK on its proposed acquisition of the Mibrag lignite mines
in eastern Germany.
But von Simson concedes that the 'process by which German companies come to
recognise that investment banks add value to transactions is very gradual .
. . There will not be a boom in M &amp; A business, but the conditions are right
for a gradual increase in the use of financial intermediaries in the German
market.'
Long-term factors include the increasing tendency of German conglomerates to
'unbundle' non-core businesses or the increasing trend towards privatisation
of assets owned by federal and regional government, von Simson believes.
At least two new foreign investment banks have established themselves in
Frankfurt since 1990, attracted by similar arguments to those advanced by Mr
von Simson.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has made a big splash in the
Frankfurt financial community: it has recently taken a second floor in the
Messeturm skyscraper and has doubled its personnel in Germany to 120 over
the last year alone.
Phil Murphy, one of the firm's two resident partners in Germany, says that,
along with the Hong-Kong office, Frankfurt is the fastest growing office in
the entire Goldman Sachs network. The firm is active in the fixed income and
equity markets in Germany as well as mergers and acquisitions.
Kleinwort Benson's presence is more modest: there are just six professionals
based in the Frankfurt office. But the evolution of the office since it
opened last year shows how, with a degree of flexibility, a UK merchant bank
can adapt itself to changing circumstances in the German corporate finance
market.
'When we started, we expected that 90 per cent of our business would be
mergers and acquisitions,' says Mr Hendrik Borggreve, chief executive of
Kleinwort's German operations. 'That was the game in town and everybody was
doing it. But then we faced difficulties as the market started to dry up.
When we started it was possible to line up 50 or so buyers for every company
that came up for sale. Now almost nobody wants to buy.'
The solution was to broaden the range of service offered by the new office -
with a particular focus on project finance, a London speciality which had
not hitherto been developed on an international basis.
Kleinwort's Frankfurt office is advising on the financing of a number of
important infrastructure projects in eastern Europe. For example, it is
advising Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company, on two such projects:
a DM5bn plan to construct a pipeline to bring Russian natural gas to
Germany; and a DM1.5bn proposal to build a polyethylene plant at Novy
Urengoy in Siberia in conjunction with western partners. Kleinwort is also
advising on the financing for the planned D-5 motorway which will link
Prague with Nuremburg via Pilsen.
'After 16 months in action I am confident that we will make a profit this
year,' says Borggreve. 'The office is ahead of budget.'
Not all international investment bankers operating in Germany can make such
a positive statement. Sceptics - such as the anonymous banker above - expect
an early shake-out as institutions that decide the investment in time and
money needed to crack the German market is too great.

strike pot of gold - As the pace quickens, John Thornhill reviews the
privatisation bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FACED with the pressures of rising budget deficits and the demands of ageing
populations, governments around the world are feeling the squeeze.
Many have hit on the same solution of privatising state-owned assets to plug
the gaps in their nation's balance sheets. Last year, about Dollars 70bn was
raised from such sales. With enormous privatisation programmes under way in
western and eastern Europe, Latin America and the far east, the pace of
privatisation will only quicken.
For merchant bankers, this process represents a huge pot of gold. Not only
will governments pay bankers fat fees to help prepare companies for
flotation and trade sales; integrated banks will also win a slice of the
action through distributing shares to overseas fund managers.
As well as the short term financial bonanza, bankers believe they may gain
substantial long term benefits. Helping to privatise companies will enable
banks to forge closer corporate relationships, perhaps resulting in mergers
and acquisition work.
One of the biggest and most attractive privatisation programmes is being
launched in France. The Balladur government is committed to transferring at
least 21 companies to the private sector over the next five years. More than
Dollars 50bn of corporate assets are likely to be brought to the market,
increasing the capitalisation of the Paris bourse by as much as one-fifth.
The world's leading merchant bankers are busy flaunting their wares to the
French government. The bulk of the work, though, seems likely to be won by
French banks.
Since the first wave of privatisation in 1986-88, French banks, such as
Societe Generale and Paribas, have grown in size and sophistication,
building up their international distribution networks. But there may be rich
pickings for foreign banks with a strong presence in the US and the far
East, in particular. Prominent among them is Goldman Sachs.
Mr Sylvain Hefes, the first French partner of the US investment bank,
believes Goldman Sachs can play a big role in the privatisation programme.
The bank has been developing its presence in Europe over many years,
advising on UK privatisations and, recently, helping to place shares in
Repsol and Endesa of Spain.
In France, it has been developing a high profile presence in the mergers and
acquisitions field. Last year, for example, it advised - somewhat
controversially - Assurances Generales de France about its purchase of a 25
per cent stake in AMB of Germany for Pounds 422m.
Mr Hefes believes that US fund managers will have a keen appetite for the
shares of French privatisation stocks. Many of those to be privatised are
well known, world class companies such as Rhone Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine.
US fund managers are relatively underweight in the French market and eager
to increase their exposure to markets outside the US.
Moreover, Mr Hefes argues that Goldman Sachs is the natural partner for US
companies seeking investments in France. He points out that French companies
have invested four times as much in the US as their US counterparts have
done in France. Over the past few years, however, Goldman has advised
Emerson Electric about its Pounds 290m acquisition of Leroy-Somer and helped
the US drugs group Bristol-Myers Squibb buy a stake in UPSA.
'We have a dominant position in the world's equity market and we can also
help develop partnerships, restructurings, joint ventures and strategic
alliances,' Mr Hefes says.
Mr Jacques Mayoux, former chairman of Societe Generale who acts as an
adviser to Goldman Sachs in Paris, suggests that privatisation will have
wider economic implications, increasing the role of the market in France.
This is likely to produce greater industry rationalisation, leading to more
focused groupings.
'Companies are going to have to think more in financial terms. They will
have to consider how to pay dividends and how to present themselves to the
market. After that, they may have greater flexibility to win market leading
positions in different product areas, selling some assets and buying
others,' Mr Mayoux says.
He believes many French companies will also develop more international
alliances along the lines of Renault's link-up with Volvo. This, of course,
all means lucrative work for investment banks.
Yet Goldman Sachs will probably take years to establish itself fully on the
French financial scene. It has just 20 staff in Paris - although more
bankers work on French projects from its European headquarters in London.
Moreover, the French government is notorious in defence of national banking
institutions. Given the presumed role of 'Anglo-Saxon speculators' in
humiliating the franc, it may prove especially sniffy about US and UK banks.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (9): Racing
to catch up with the west - Post-communist Europe's developing private
sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BAD NEWS from Yugoslavia, similar violence along the borderlands of southern
Russia, continuing economic decline and rampant inflation in Russia, and
even more so in Ukraine, are conditioning the attitudes of many investors
towards the post-communist world as a whole.
But a deeper, more discriminating investigation reveals a profound economic
and social transformation under way in many parts of this huge region,
especially in those countries not engulfed by ethnic and other resurgent
historical struggles.
As expected, the fastest and deepest changes are taking place in central
Europe, although even here the full scale has been masked by official
statistics pointing to steep and continuing declines in industrial
production and GDP. But statistics which show that the economies of Poland,
Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics are running at production levels
20-30 per cent below 1988, the last full year of communist control, distort
reality.
What such figures do show is the extent to which the old economy of
polluting heavy industry, arms factories and shoddy consumer goods has been
scrapped or down-sized. They do not fully reflect the rocketing output from
the local private sector, the rapid increase in the size and sophistication
of service industries - from retailing and advertising to banking and
property management - or the degree of re-integration into the global
economy as foreign investors introduce new technology, buy and restructure
privatised state enterprises or step up production from new,
state-of-the-art, carmaking, detergent, glass, chemical and other new plants
on green field sites.
Central Europe - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia
 -accounts for just over 70m of the 400m people in the former Soviet Empire.
Another 8m live in the three Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -
which are likely to achieve similar levels of income and economic
performance by the early years of the 21st century.
All are determined to achieve west European standards of living, and to
integrate as fully as possible, and as soon as possible, into a suitably
enlarged EC and Nato. By any standards this represents an enormous business
opportunity which multinational consumer and capital goods corporations have
been among the first to spot.
To date the inflow of equity capital into the region since 1989, probably
running at about Dollars 10-12bn, is small compared to that which poured
into Spain or even Portugal as Iberia entered the EC. It is dwarfed by the
capital flows into a re-invigorated Latin America and South East Asia where
capitalist institutions and attitudes already exist to build on, and returns
on capital are often both faster and higher.
But the strong possibility that Poland, which with 39m people, is the
largest of the non-Soviet post-communist states, will this year achieve the
highest economic growth in a generally depressed Europe has highlighted the
potential for rapid and sustainable growth once the re-structured economies
recover from the painful surgery of the last three years.
ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power generating and engineering group, was one of
the first strategic investors to target Poland and has gone on to acquire a
string of power generating and related plants throughout central Europe.
Injecting management know-how and focusing on staff and worker retraining
rather than capital, ABB has developed both a new low-cost source for an
increasing range of components and staked out a strategic position as
supplier, from a domestic base, of much needed power generating,
anti-pollution and other equipment, for which demand in the region is bound
to rise sharply as economic growth gathers pace.
Ikea, the Swedish-based furniture company, is another Nordic investor
well-apprised of the cost advantages involved in sourcing product from
central European factories. It too has been attracted by the potential for
steady and protracted growth in new markets of long-starved consumers with
western tastes and a huge pent-up demand for relatively cheap and stylish
consumer durables.
In August, Ikea opened the biggest furniture store in central and eastern
Europe just outside Warsaw and plans to invest Dollars 55m in building other
new stores by 1996. In the meantime its three Polish factories, using cheap
local wood and chipboard and low cost labour, are already accounting for 20
per cent of the group's total world production and will double this over the
next three years.
It is a similar story in the automobile sector where Volkswagen's takeover
and DM7bn investment plans for Skoda Automobilova in the Czech republic, and
Fiat's Dollars 2bn commitment to Poland, have transformed prospects for the
central European car industry alongside smaller investments by General
Motors, Ford and Suzuki of Japan and smaller assembly operations by Peugeot
and Citroen.
Hungary remains the main recipient of foreign investment with over Dollars
700m flowing into the country over the first half of this year. But Poland
and the Czech republic seem poised to attract the bulk of merger and
acquisition interest over the next few years, as privatisation releases more
former state assets to the private sector and Poland finally reaches
agreement with the commercial banks on the reduction and re-scheduling of
its Dollars 12bn commercial bank debt.
German and Austrian companies are particularly interested in acquiring
assets in the Czech republic, which juts into German-speaking Europe like a
wedge; and to a lesser extent in Slovakia where Bratislava, the Slovak
capital, is almost a suburb of Vienna.
For Germany, the collapse of communism has meant not only re-unification,
and the unexpectedly difficult process of re-absorbing the eastern
provinces, but also the opening up for trade and investment of its
traditional east European backyard. German companies are particularly aware
of the strategic importance of acquiring enterprises in central Europe whose
management have long standing personal links with enterprises throughout the
former Soviet bloc.
Their eyes are on the longer term future, when Russia and Ukraine will
re-emerge from the current prostration, urgently needing buses, trains,
trams, power stations, motorways - everything, indeed, as cheaply and as
ruggedly made as possible.
That is why two of the most interesting deals in recent months have been the
link-up between AEG-Westinghouse of Germany and CKD of Prague, to build
trams for both eastern and western markets; and the Skoda Pilsens tie-up
with Siemens, also to make steam turbines and other equipment for the wider
pan-European market now emerging.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (10): Loans
replaced by bonds - Borrowers can now bypass bank financing
</HEADLINE>

CONDITIONS for financing mergers and acquisitions have rarely been so
favourable. Stock markets are booming. Interest rates are at historically
low levels. The availability of such financing opportunities is propitious
because it coincides with a reduction in the availability of bank credit.
Highly-leveraged companies in the US - and to a lesser extent in the UK -
have managed to shift the mountain of debt which was threatening to
overwhelm them a few years ago. Some have even built up some cash, and these
are at a distinct advantage in the M&amp;A market.
More borrowers are now able to bypass bank financing, which had become much
harder to obtain. This is partly because there are fewer hostile takeovers
than in the 1980s. In an agreed bid, the need to have financing already in
place is less pressing.
At the start of this year, the new Basle capital adequacy requirements
(forcing banks to set aside a proportion of their capital against their
assets) came in, but the squeeze on bank capital was already tight. In
recent years, banks have tightened their purse strings for
acquisition-related financing after suffering a bad record on their loans to
highly leveraged companies. The casualties of the economic slowdown have
also scarred banks.
The highly leveraged deals which fuelled management buyouts and leveraged
buyouts in the 1980s, mainly in the US, simply died away. The opposite
process of de-leveraging - paying off their heavy burdens of debt and
rebuilding their balance sheets - became the most obvious trend among
companies.
'Bank financing has become more difficult generally, but the sector the
banks have really clamped down on is expanding conglomerates,' says one
banker, 'particularly where there was considered to be a greater risk
because the acquisition was sizeable compared with the buyer.'
Sentiment against conglomerates has turned, partly because of bad
experiences of highly-leveraged transactions by conglomerates in the 1980s,
and also because many bankers feel that in the increasingly competitive
international environment, companies should be focusing on their core
businesses.
'There are only a handful of top acquisitive conglomerates which still
command credibility,' a banker says.
In the US, the junk bond, or high-yield bond market, has recovered from the
fall-out of the 1980s, although bank lending remains tight. The most
favourable factor has been the sharp decline in US interest rates and yields
in recent years.
This decline has starved US institutional investors, such as insurance
companies, of paper offering high returns. As a result, insurance companies
have been hungry for higher-yielding paper which has improved access to the
market for sub-investment grade companies. Many companies are comfortable to
buy lesser credits, because they believe that the US is on the way out of
recession and these credits are likely to improve rather than deteriorate.
'The bond market is replacing the loan market: the public market is willing
to buy securities at a cheaper level than banks will lend,' one banker says.
While Europe has never developed a high-yield bond market - and indeed, many
European countries have rather small and limited corporate bond markets - a
growing number of UK companies has tapped the US market, sometimes making
use of the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144A, which allows them
to issue tradeable private placements without registering. It is not yet
clear whether the trend for accepting lower credits as yields fall will
really catch on in Europe, though many emerging market borrowers have now
successfully tapped the market.
So far, European companies have been heavily dependent on the bank and
syndicated loan markets, but in the course of the latest economic turndown
they have also learnt that the banks are not necessarily their friends. As a
result, many have refinanced bank debt, and may prefer to issue securities
in the future.
'The financing levels on debt are so attractive right now that one might
expect to see a huge surge of takeover activity, but this is somewhat
mitigated by the high price of equity,' says a banker. High stock prices
mean that, although financing is easier for the buyer, the purchase price of
the company to be acquired is correspondingly higher.
The main shift in the financing of acquisitions by issuing stock is the
greater concern among the buyer's shareholders. Practice has shown that a
company has to pick an acquisition which is on a sensible scale and appeals
strategically to investors.
Some companies have also used share offerings made as a result of an
acquisition to spread their investor base - for example, by seeking a
listing in the US.
The rights issue still remains the most important means of financing M&amp;A
deals in the UK - and it is liked by UK institutions, which benefit from the
system.
The role of banks in providing M&amp;A financing remains extremely important,
but banks are no longer ready to lend first and study the deal afterwards.
More important: it is increasingly difficult, as the process of
'disintermediation' advances, for banks to compete on cost with the bond or
equity markets - which are in the middle of bull markets.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (8): Smaller
of the species under threat - Brian Bollen notes that financial advisers
must adapt - or go the way of the dinosaurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FINANCIAL advisers have had to respond to the much changed levels and
patterns of international M&amp;A activity to avoid going the way of the
dinosaurs.
Broadly, investment bankers say their work has not diminished in volume, but
that it has changed in nature since the late 1980s. There is less financial
thinking behind transactions and more strategic thinking; buyers want more
thorough 'due diligence' investigations and they seek to consider the
long-term implications of deals more carefully.
Clients are also seeking more integrated - and global - advice in the
context of an M&amp;A transaction, such as advice on financing, derivatives and
balance sheet structures. The transaction range has broadened and there has
been a shift away from transaction-centred relations.
The renaissance of relationship banking is one of the phenomena of the
1990s, says Mr Francois von Hurter, co-head of European M&amp;A at the Credit
Suisse First Boston group.
An added complication is the ability of the big, very experienced companies
to handle much of their own M&amp;A activity. A common complaint by advisers is:
'The fastest growing competitor is No Adviser.'
The main houses have evolved differently over the past 10 years, whether by
integration, internationalisation or industry specialisation, and they have
seen newcomers try to carve out a living in their traditional market. As UK
public company takeover activity has become less important, the US and
Europe have become, in strategic terms, more so.
Privatisation is another growing issue. Baring Brothers, for example,
decided to develop internationally some years ago. It says that now more
than 50 per cent of its business is cross-border work.
The bank's current workload helps to illustrate the changed marketplace.
After advising Northern Telecom of Canada in 1990 on its purchase of STC,
then a fully listed UK company, today it is advising NorTel on the sale of
STC's submarine cable business to Alcatel of France.
The legwork involved in establishing contacts with a wider European client
base could help explain why the top banks say that, despite the recession,
they have not had to shed corporate finance staff. Those who do own up to
reducing the numbers directly employed on financial advice say they have
been able to redeploy staff. Green shoots are growing and staff are at least
fully employed, if not actually in short supply.
'We have kept busy throughout the slowdown,' says Mr Tony Freeman, a senior
strategic adviser at Merrill Lynch in London. 'We have been less affected
than, say, UK merchant banks, who are tied to a particular market. We're now
growing the business, recruiting and developing young people within the
organisation; we're investing in clients, in people and in ideas.'
Those with international ambitions need global facilities as well as
multi-product capabilities. 'If you have a substantial increase in
cross-border transactions, you need an adviser with local expertise in
different markets,' says Mr Klaus Diedrichs, J P Morgan's co-head of
European M&amp;A.
J P Morgan, highly regarded by its rivals for the way it has translated
existing corporate relationships into financial advisory mandates, says it
has doubled the numbers employed in its European M&amp;A operations over the
past three years.
Others - admittedly smaller and less successful - say that there are at
least 25 per cent too many people across the City in banks, legal and
accounting firms, and that something has to give.
Meanwhile, the recent departure of co-founder Mr Joseph Perella from
Wasserstein Perella in New York is seen in some quarters as further proof
that the days may be numbered for the niche firms - the so-called boutiques
which mushroomed at the height of the M&amp;A market in the late 1980s.
While J O Hambro Magan in the UK, and Wolfensohn and Gleacher &amp; Co in the
US, are acknowledged successes, few bankers see a long-term role for the
smaller of the species, unless it is based on sector specialisation and
relationship.
There is an argument, however, that if the niche firms did not exist, they
would have to be invented in order to service smaller industrialists who
have growth ambitions but are nervous in a formal City atmosphere.
Continental Europeans, too, often feel happier turning for advice to
individuals with a demonstrable pedigree, rather than to faceless
organisations (some of which have an unfortunate reputation for arrogance).
Mr John MacArthur, the founder of MacArthur &amp; Co, formerly of Kleinwort
Benson and Prudential Bache, argues that the critical question is whether
the niche firms will become mini-merchant banks, developing a retained
client list.
'If M&amp;A business is going to be smaller and different, those who set out
their stall to do pure M&amp;A could have a pretty thin time,' he says. 'We are
a full service corporate finance advisory organisation, from the generation
of ideas to organisation and execution; many of the people around are not
equipped by background or training to give mainstream corporate finance
advice in the UK.'
Mr MacArthur's own small team, which already features Mr Nigel Christie, an
old Kleinwort Benson and Warburg hand, was strengthened recently by the
arrival of Mr David Hudson from Campbell Lutyens Hudson, where he was a
partner.
Wasserstein Perella, for its part, is firmly optimistic about the long-term
future.
'We have a 10 to 15-year plan which includes diversification efforts that
have already been in process for five years,' says Mr Michael Biondi,
managing director. 'We also believe our advisory business is solid and will
continue to improve as the market improves.'
The debate on whether the corporate finance arms of accounting firms can
legitimately claim to be financial advisers has taken something of a new
turn as M&amp;A values have fallen. Bank attitudes range from grudging
acceptance of such claims to contemptuous dismissal.
'If you widen the definition of corporate finance activity, there is a
perception that the accounting firms have muscled in,' says one banker. 'But
they have done little more than assemble traditional accounting-related
activities in one department.'
'We have a worldwide network second to none,' argues Mr Richard Agutter, for
the other side. The chairman of KPMG's international corporate finance
network says his firm is again competing with merchant banks at the lower
end of its target Pounds 5m-Pounds 50m transaction range.
Mr Agutter says: 'A number of merchant banks have come down into what we
thought was our market place, and we have moved up a bit; the edges have
become blurred.' KPMG illustrates its points by referring to its role in
advising Gillette on the acquisition of Parker Pen, a deal concluded earlier
this year.
The corporate finance division of Price Waterhouse exudes more aggression.
Several years ago Price Waterhouse might have accepted a company's
reluctance to use an accounting firm as a fully fledged financial adviser.
'We have now been in business long enough to be a fair way up the corporate
credibility curve,' says Mr Tom Wilson, a senior partner at PW Corporate
Finance. 'We regard as our competitors not the other accounting firms but
the established M&amp;A houses who are operating at the top end of the market.
The keys are good contacts with local companies on the ground, which we
have.'
Mr Peter Espenhahn, deputy head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell,
agrees: 'There is a market for people doing smaller transactions. Our cost
structure does not allow us to do a small deal for a first time client; we
are happy to see the accounting firms doing that business.'
