FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (6):
Euro-predictions go awry - Brian Bollen reports less, not more activity in
the EC single market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RECESSION is taking the brunt of the blame for the slowdown in European
cross-border mergers and acquisitions.
When the single market came into being at the start of this year, many
merchant and investment bankers confidently predicted that there would be a
renewed wave of activity as companies faced up to the market's competitive
pressures.
The evidence of the first few months shows that this has not happened.
Indeed, current wisdom is that much M&amp;A activity executed under the banner
of the single market was driven by other more traditional factors: the
consolidation of mature industries, the search for global competitiveness or
a quick increase in market share.
Many bankers reason that activity will recover when Europe's recessions end
and that volume will be increased by privatisation, the deregulation of
industry sectors, and by restructurings and non-core disposals in the need
to increase solvency.
Euro-sceptics argue, however, that substantial acquisitions are taking
longer to digest than first thought. Today there is a more realistic
attitude towards the single market.
One prediction that has been borne out is the change in the nature of
international corporate activity. Hostile takeovers are out, and a more
co-operative approach, characterised by mergers, alliances and joint
ventures, is in.
Underlining the effect of recession is the shift in the balance of power,
from seller to buyer. On non-core disposals, you can kiss the old-fashioned
auction approach goodbye, says Mr Francois von Hurter, co-head of European
M&amp;A at the Credit Suisse First Boston group. Life in the new world requires
more flexibility and imagination on the part of bankers.
The recession contributed to a 40 per cent fall in the volume of
cross-border M&amp;A activity worldwide in the first half of 1993, according to
the Deal Watch survey carried out by KPMG, the international accounting
firm.
The survey recorded preliminary figures for cross-border acquisitions of
Dollars 25.2bn in the first six months, compared with Dollars 42.2bn in the
same period in 1992. French buying activity fell most, from Dollars 8.7bn to
Dollars 428m. Although French companies have been the most enthusiastic
buyers of companies in other EC countries (French purchases from 1988 to
first half 1993 have totalled Dollars 35.7bn), the French recession dictates
a cautious approach to investment. Survival rather than expansion is the
priority.
Italian purchases also fell sharply. Investigations into political and
business corruption are cited as the significant factors - while companies
and senior executives are under suspicion of bribery, it is difficult for
them to focus on large-scale foreign expansion.
The value of cross-border sales of EC companies nose-dived again in the
first half of this year, to Dollars 12.3bn, after recovering to Dollars 42bn
in the full year 1992, from Dollars 23.1bn in the full year 1991.
Japanese purchases of EC companies have declined rapidly since the peak year
of 1990, when there were 50 deals, worth almost Dollars 3.4bn. In the first
half of 1993, KPMG logged just seven Japanese purchases, worth a total of
Dollars 34m. The most popular target sectors for Japanese companies buying
into the EC in 1988-93 were hotels and catering, electrical and electronics,
chemicals and pharmaceuticals, real estate and wholesale distribution.
US buying over the same period shows a different pattern, with purchases
peaking a year earlier, when there were 221 purchases worth Dollars 12.1bn.
That figure slumped in 1990, but has been recovering steadily ever since.
In the first half of 1993, KPMG recorded 88 US buys, worth a total of nearly
Dollars 4.4bn. The main target sectors have been vehicle manufacturing,
food, drink and tobacco, electrical and electronics, chemicals and
pharmaceuticals and oil and gas. The UK has been everyone's favourite target
EC country.
Bankers like to remind one, however, that the European single market is a
marathon, not a sprint; its requirements will feature as an important
consideration in the long term, if only because the EC is a long way behind
the US in industry consolidation. Large-scale consolidation is widely
predicted, for example, in banking and financial services, whether through
alliances, cross-shareholdings or acquisition.
In five to 10 years there will probably be fewer independent banks and
insurance companies in the UK, says Mr John Studzinski, managing director
responsible for Morgan Stanley International's financial advisory business
in Europe.
The Bank of England agrees that the expected benefits of the single market
programme have yet to be fully realised in banking and financial services.
In its most recent quarterly report the Bank says it is perhaps more
apparent that early expectations were themselves rather unrealistic,
especially on timing and the extent of the transformation that could be
achieved within EC financial markets.
Institutions are continuing to make acquisitions and establish co-operation
agreements, says the Bank. A number of factors could yet lead to a
resurgence of activity. In the end, the single market programme may yet have
a profound impact on the financial services sector within the EC.
In food and drink, Philip Morris of the US has carefully built up its
European core business since the acquisition of Jacobs Suchard in 1990,
notes J P Morgan. It followed up with the acquisition of Norway's Freia
Marabou last year and Terry's of the UK this year - important moves to fill
gaps in its product portfolio and geographic coverage. Many medium-sized
food companies will continue to be acquired and consolidated into the
majors, says Mr Studzinski.
Retailing is tipped as a possible candidate for consolidation, too, although
there is uncertainty about whether retailing can work well on a grand scale,
and whether retailing concepts can be exported successfully. Judgment is
reserved on the French forays of Kingfisher and Tesco. Kingfisher's purchase
of Darty, an electrical retailer, and Tesco's purchase of Catteau remain an
intriguing exception rather than a new rule.
The pharmaceuticals and personal healthcare sector has already seen
large-scale international consolidation. Recent significant announcements
were the joint ventures between the UK's Glaxo and Wellcome and
Warner-Lambert of the US; but analysts say there are still too many
medium-sized players. Heavy research and development bills will make it
difficult for smaller companies to survive.
There are likely to be further consolidating moves in the European
pharmaceuticals sector, says Mr Stephen Brisby, head of UBS's European
corporate finance arm, which advised Italy's Montedison on the sale.
In deregulated growth industries, such as telecommunications, Bell Canada's
purchase of a 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications, a subsidiary of
Cable &amp; Wireless, is used to demonstrate the need for larger international
players to buy in Europe to build market share.
The discussions between KLM, SAS, Austrian Airlines and Swissair are an
example of much-needed industry consolidation, which has nothing to do with
the single market, says Mr Rod Peacock, joint head of European M&amp;A at J P
Morgan.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (7): British
bankers scramble to unbundle - John Thornhill finds that UK takeover
activity is at a 25 year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH takeover activity in the UK at a 25-year low, merchant bankers have
been scrambling around for new ways to make a living.
The last dribbles of the UK privatisation programme, a smattering of
international joint ventures and the recent wave of rights issues have kept
many of them occupied. But advising companies about the latest fashion for
unbundling and restructuring a business is perhaps providing their most
lucrative pastime.
Arguably, the trend began with BAT Industries in 1990; it decided to
unbundle itself rather than face the predations of Sir James Goldsmith.
Merchant bankers were well rewarded for hiving off the Argos retailing chain
and the Wiggins Teape Appleton paper business into separately listed
companies. Since then they have been merrily trying to spot other companies
which could benefit from more 'focus'. Courtaulds performed the same trick
with its textiles business - and Racal did it with Vodafone.
In the past year, there have been several other examples of UK companies
restructuring themselves with the aim of concentrating on discrete
industries and releasing additional shareholder value:
ICI, the chemicals giant, has demerged its pharmaceuticals business,
creating a separately listed FT-SE 100 company, Zeneca, capitalised at more
than Pounds 6bn.
ICI argued that the deal was driven primarily by industrial logic: the
demerger would enable both its chemicals and pharmaceuticals companies to
develop more aggressively in their chosen markets.
Charter Consolidated has simplified its shareholding structure, and
effectively bought its independence, by selling its 38 per cent in Johnson
Matthey for Pounds 342m and buying out its own 36 per cent shareholder,
Minorco, for Pounds 236m. The company claimed this would enable it to focus
on expanding its core industrial concerns.
Richemont is untangling its international web of corporate assets, to create
two separately-quoted tobacco and luxury goods businesses, Rothmans
International and Vendome. As well as releasing cash for both Richemont and
other shareholders, the move should create more clearly delineated
businesses with simpler shareholding structures.
This unbundling trend has resulted from a variety of pressures, other than
the threat of takeover.
First, fund managers appear increasingly attracted to companies which 'stick
to their knitting'. Big institutional investors have grown increasingly
sophisticated at spreading risk and diversifying their own portfolios.
The traditional rationale for agglomeration - namely to smooth out
cyclicality of earnings - is therefore dropping down the list of investors'
needs.
Managers, too, appear to have learned from the excesses of the 1980s, when
some companies went wild exploiting paper money and lax accounting standards
to grow shaky businesses by means of acquisition. Management gurus now
preach the steadier virtues of organic growth and 'core competences'.
Companies now seem more inclined to conclude agreed deals in related
industries than make hostile approaches in unrelated sectors. This lessens
the associated financial and managerial risks. Buyers are likely to have far
more familiarity with the target company, and can undertake extensive due
diligence.
As Ken Costa, director of merchant bankers S G Warburg, puts it: 'In the
1980s you flirted with all the girls in the street and married someone from
across town. This time, you flirt but marry the girl next door. You know all
the family history and all the rows, because you are next-door neighbours.'
The other important element in the equation, though, is the low inflation
which prevails in much of the developed world. High inflation corrupted the
value of cash, encouraging managers to splash out on assets as a hedge.
'The idea was that you could not hold cash, because inflation would erode
its value. Instead, you invested in a huge capital base which would help you
out by appreciating in value,' says Mr Costa. 'But there is now no
embarrassment in giving back money to shareholders.' Reuters has perhaps
established a precedent in returning Pounds 350m of surplus cash to
shareholders by means of its share buy-back scheme.
These changing corporate trends have important consequences for merchant
bankers. They suggest that opportunistic hostile takeover bids, which formed
their staple diet in the 1980s, will be infrequent.
This may make life tricky for the small merchant banking boutiques, which
are heavily reliant on the success fees derived from traditional M&amp;A work.
Companies seem likely to continue shedding peripheral businesses as they
focus on their main areas of skill and knowledge. When expanding, they seem
more likely to buy unwanted divisions of other companies than to launch bids
for quoted assets.
The recent experience of the predatory MB-Caradon is perhaps illustrative of
the trend. After scouring the stock market for any value in the quoted
building materials sector, the cash-rich predator has homed in on an parcel
of building-products assets owned by RTZ, which is slimming down to its core
mining interests. Merchant banks need intimate contacts and a fair degree of
lateral thinking to initiate and benefit from such deals. Those banks with
strong analytical teams are perhaps best placed to spot the opportunities.
But the more austere climate of the 1990s will not necessarily put merchant
bankers out of fashion. Asset reshuffles and corporate restructurings can
prove just as profitable for merchant banks as takeover deals.
This is especially true if such deals span different countries' regulatory
and tax regimes. The restructuring of Richemont's tobacco and luxury goods
business provides a case in point. The reshuffle created two companies with
twin listings on the London and Amsterdam, and London and Luxembourg, stock
exchanges.
'What you lose in hostility, you make up for in complexity,' Mr Costa says.
'It just puts a premium on ingenuity and innovation.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (4): Fast
mover across Europe - Profile: J P Morgan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past few years, while many other banks have cut back their mergers
and acquisitions teams, J P Morgan, the blue-chip US bank, has taken a
contrary approach.
'We have increased the resources dedicated to the business, and maybe faster
than some of our peers,' said Mr Rod Peacock, co-head of J P Morgan's
European advisory group.
The cross-border European M&amp;A business has relatively few big players. S G
Warburg and Goldman Sachs are still considered the leaders of the pack, but
J P Morgan is one of a small number of other participants that can claim to
be genuinely pan-European: the bank has long-established bases in all the
important European financial centres.
But while it is considered a market-leader in the securities business, J P
Morgan is still not one of the first names to spring to mind in the context
of European M&amp;A activity.
The team has been built up from 10 to 60 professionals in the past four
years - still a drop in the ocean of 4,500 J P Morgan staff in Europe. The
European M&amp;A team is based in London and staffed by pan-European industry
specialists, with teams in all the main European centres.
The aim is to 'combine a global or pan-European industry view with local
market execution,' says Mr Peacock.
While claiming not to focus on league tables, the bank has nevertheless
risen from nowhere to rank fifth in the 1992 list of financial advisers on
cross-border European deals compiled by Acquisitions Monthly, the M&amp;A trade
magazine.
Although J P Morgan has been involved in the M&amp;A market for many years, the
bank was not a big hitter during the boom days of the 1980s.
'Our intent is to be a strategic adviser to our clients,' says Mr Walter
Gubert, now head of corporate finance in Europe, who headed up the thrust in
recent years. 'This is as true today as it was 10 years ago. J P Morgan's
value-driven philosophy has not changed, but the evolution of the market and
of shareholder attitudes has shifted the emphasis from the hostile deal to
the complex industrially-driven transaction,' he explained.
It is certainly true that J P Morgan has benefited from the greater emphasis
on advisory work, and the virtual disappearance of the hostile takeover. 'I
get professional, client-centred advice, and that is what I want,' says one
company chairman.
Current conditions - the emphasis on relationship banking, the need for
industrial restructurings, the increase in international industrial
competition, the focus on core businesses - favour that approach. 'It is a
positive cycle for us,' says Mr Gubert.
Mr Klaus Diederichs, co-head of European advisory, says the acquisition, in
1991, by Marzotto of Italy of the majority stake in Hugo Boss, the German
fashion manufacturer, from a Japanese group, is typical of the
multi-dimensional nature of the advisory business in the 1990s. It required
the close co-ordination of the bank's network in Asia and across Europe.
'It was J P Morgan's relationship with the buyer and its knowledge of the
needs of the players in the industry which enabled the bank to move faster
than its competitors to secure the deal for its client,' says Mr Diederichs.
In an unusual step, Mr Gubert was appointed to the board of Hugo Boss,
following the acquisition, to help the transition to new ownership. 'This is
an illustration of the client-focused nature of J P Morgan's advisory
activity,' says Mr Diederichs.
As an example of the firm's culture of putting the client first, Mr Gubert
tells the story of going to see Sir Dennis Weatherstone, the bank's
chairman, about a potential deal, and being cut short with a single
question: 'If you were the client, would you do the deal?'
The idea of such team-spirit in a bank culture, where staff are
traditionally ruled by the annual bonus, is rather hard to credit. Mr Gubert
insists that it is possible. 'We do pay bonuses on performance, but the most
important measure of performance is the client's satisfaction. If a client
is not happy that will affect your bonus,' he says.
Among its peers, J P Morgan commands respect, but not awe.
'J P Morgan starts with a very good client base and a long-term orientation,
both of which are needed in this business,' says one M&amp;A specialist. 'They
are good at the bread and butter stuff, but there are some gaps in their
capabilities.' For example, he adds, JP Morgan's historic exclusion from the
equity business in the US meant that its equity distribution lagged other
houses.
Another M&amp;A specialist says that the most successful professionals in the
market would not choose to work at J P Morgan. The more aggressive approach
of other banks - and the larger pay packets - prove more attractive to many
high-flyers.
Although J P Morgan sees its lack of involvement in the area of hostile bids
as a strength, some of its competitors say that its lack of experience in
this area means the bank has a less thorough feel for the market as a whole.
However, it is positively viewed by its largely blue-chip clients, many of
which deal with the bank across a number of different areas.
'We have an ongoing relationship with J P Morgan, based on fact that they
are more similar in character to us than other banks,' says Reto Domeniconi,
executive vice-president of Nestle. The world's largest foods group was
advised by J P Morgan in its recent acquisition of Italgel, the Italian
ice-cream manufacturer sold as part of Italy's privatisation programme by
state holding company IRI. 'One has to tread carefully in Italy. We were at
ease that they were well established in Italy, and that is why every thing
went well,' he adds.
Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters, which was advised on its recent
share buy-back by J P Morgan, says: 'They have given me distinguished advice
on at least four or five occasions.' As chairman of the bank's UK advisory
council, he is not now an unbiased witness, as he admits. However, he first
came across J P Morgan in the late 1970s, when it proved 'steady and
unflappable' during the restructuring of Courtaulds.
Another client describes the bank as 'solid, but not overly aggressive'.
Such a description, applied in the 1980s, would have perhaps been considered
a slight. In 1993, it is intended as a compliment.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (5): When the
going gets tough . . . - Profile: J Henry Schroder Wagg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1983 J Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK investment bank, was taught a horrible
lesson.
One of its oldest and most valued clients, Thomas Tilling, faced a bid from
BTR, the conglomerate. Not content with Schroders' advice, it turned to its
rival, SG Warburg, with the parting explanation: 'When you are fighting for
your life you need the best'.
Mr Win Bischoff, who was appointed chief executive at Schroders in the same
year, says Tilling's defection 'really hurt'. But he also believes it was
responsible for a renaissance at the bank - by teaching it that it could no
longer afford to be complacent. 'We were too relaxed, too reactive, and too
remote,' he says.
The more aggressive approach paid off: in the last 10 years the group's
capitalisation has increased from Pounds 100m to more than Pounds 1.5bn.
Mr Bischoff decided early on in the 1980s that the bank would not try to do
everything. 'We like to think of ourselves as a relatively small flexible
company.' Corporate finance operations are still at the heart of the group.
At the time of Big Bang, most of Schroders' competitors chose the opposite
route, which proved a mistake. An exception was SG Warburg. But it needed
the capital to finance its new business in securities.
Schroders conserved its capital, and its family control, by staying out.
Since it became a publicly listed company in 1961, the bank has never raised
capital.
Because the bank makes a significant amount of money advising clients on how
to tap shareholders for cash, Mr Bischoff is the last person to criticise
other banks for going down that path. But he believes Schroders is stronger
for having conserved its capital and share structure - the family of Mr
Bruno Schroder owns almost half the bank, which effectively gives them
control.
Mr Bischoff says this has imposed important disciplines on the bank: 'We
have to focus on less capital intensive businesses.'
One of his earlier decisions as chief executive was to sell its American
bank. It made no sense for a London-based merchant banking group to be in
commercial banking in New York, and Schroders switched from commercial to
investment banking there, by taking a 50 per cent stake in Wertheim
Schroder. In the long term, Schroders is likely to take full control.
Mr Bischoff says that joint ventures do not usually last forever. 'In
management terms there are advantages to be able to integrate our businesses
in the United States.'
In the UK, Mr Bischoff is content with the present structure. Analysts
estimate that Schroder Investment Management, whose managed funds total more
than Pounds 35bn, could account for up to two-thirds of Schroders' stock
market valuation. If floated off it could further increase the share price.
But Mr Bischoff firmly resists such suggestions. 'We do not need the capital
 -and furthermore, how could we better invest it?'
Schroder Ventures now accounts for 10 per cent of the bank's profits.
Schroders recently reported after-tax profits of Pounds 64m, 23 per cent
more than the previous year, excluding an extraordinary item. Mr Bischoff
adds a cautionary note. The larger venture capital businesses become, the
more often they may have problems in looking for an exit via a flotation.
'It has not been an easy time for the capital venture business'.
Having got this far, most banking analysts wonder whether Schroders can
continue to grow. The view at SG Warburg is that Schroders lacks the
distribution to become a serious threat outside the UK. As a rival puts it:
'A merchant banker is only as good as his last conversation with a broker.'
Mr Bischoff happily concedes that Schroders' distribution does not come
close to that of Warburg's. But then he is happy to rent its stockbrokers.
'Did you know we have more clients that use Warburg Securities than SG
Warburg?'
But, some banking analysts say, that is fine when things are going well.
When corporate finance deals start to go wrong, as in the aborted flotation
of GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, an investment bank needs a
broker to tell it what is going on.
In Schroders' defence, Mr Bischoff says it was only the UK adviser. Nomura
International was the global manager which (he believes) did and does lack
international distribution. Furthermore, he says all the advisers, including
the brokers to the GPA failed flotation, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, misjudged
the market.
'No other bank would have got different soundings from the market' says Mr
Bischoff. Warburg, however, turned down the opportunity of advising GPA on a
flotation, which Schroders could not resist.
The GPA association did not appear to harm Schroders' reputation. Its
continued association with the company, by helping with its restructuring,
indicates how far it has come since it was abandoned by Thomas Tilling.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (3): Ailing
companies need help - Emiko Terazono investigates the restructuring of
corporate Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In the late 1980s, mergers and acquisitions for Japanese companies meant
overseas expansion through the purchase of an international network, buying
a US movie studio, or diversifying into new businesses.
But some corporations, facing the fourth year of falling profits and under
pressure to restructure operations, now regard merger and acquisitions as a
means of surviving the current economic slump.
As a result the opportunity now is the restructuring of corporate Japan.
Deals in which distressed companies are taken over by larger domestic
companies are now the mainstream of M&amp;A in Japan. Japanese companies'
purchases of other Japanese corporations rose by 18.5 per cent in value last
year. Ailing companies, hit by falling profits and higher capital costs -
particularly smaller manufacturers and service businesses - are in need of
assistance.
Earlier this year Nippon Steel, the country's largest steel company,
indicated interest in buying a majority stake in NMB Semiconductor, a
struggling electronics company. NMB was a subsidiary of Minebea, the world's
leading maker of miniature bearings. Minebea entered the semiconductor
market in 1984 as part of a diversification programme. However, the losses
at Minebea made it impossible for the company to support NMB, which was hit
by the sharp downturn of the world electronics industry.
A more recent rescue was that of Cosmo Securities, a second tier broker, by
Daiwa Bank. Cosmo posted an extraordinary loss of Y69.8bn as a result of its
tobashi deals (or shuffling of one client's account to another to avoid
realisation of investment losses). Daiwa injected more than Y70bn through
share purchases of Cosmo; it become its major shareholder, with more than a
50 per cent stake.
The government says that Daiwa's acquisition of Cosmo is an exception.
Although banks have been allowed partial entrance into the securities
industry since last April, the government has yet to allow commercial banks
to hold stock broker affiliates. The ministry of finance also waived a rule
which forbids banks to hold more than 5 per cent of a company.
However, the financial community is now placing bets on the next brokerage
bailout, because the rescue of Cosmo comes at a time when smaller brokers,
which depend on retail commissions for revenue, are in dire need of
financial help, as trading volume of the stock market has plunged. Aside
from the tobashi losses, Cosmo itself posted a pre-tax loss of Y150m for the
first four months to July, as a result of the sluggish stock market.
Although the trend seems to be offering a chance for overseas companies
looking to buy Japanese companies at cheap prices, the number of
acquisitions by foreign companies has been limited. An official at Nomura
Wasserstein Perella, the M&amp;A subsidiary of Nomura Securities, says that
although there are opportunities, there have been no large acquisitions, but
small joint ventures, for strategic reasons.
According to a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick, purchasers last year included
Ciba-Geigy, Atochem, and Philips. Eight out of 43 deals were in
pharmaceuticals, seven in industrial machinery and chemicals, six in
computers.
As for Japanese companies' acquisitions abroad, deals by value fell by 64
per cent last year. A market is emerging for the resale of foreign companies
acquired during the late 1980s.
Japanese companies are still licking their wounds from rash investments made
during the late 1980s when the Tokyo stock market was rising and capital was
raised through equity linked funding at almost zero cost.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, which bought Lyphomed, a US drug maker, in 1990,
has seen its consolidated profit plunge due to losses at the US subsidiary.
Although the parent company is faring well as a result of its innovative
drugs, the US operations are a large burden to the rest of the group.
The problems for Japanese acquisitions of overseas companies have not only
been capital related, but also culturally oriented. The difference in
management style has compounded the difficulties of relations between the
new management and workers. Bridgestone, the tyre company which acquired
Firestone, the US tyre manufacturer, five years ago, is seeing the US
operations become profitable at last. Apart from outdated plant automation,
the company's 'kid glove' approach also hampered the arrival of benefits
from the acquisition.
Absence of appetite for foreign acquisitions by Japanese companies has also
prompted Treuhand, the agency responsible for the sale of former East German
companies, to close its operations in Tokyo. However, Nomura Wasserstein
Perella says that once the economy recovers, Japanese companies will once
again look overseas. 'There won't be the mega deals you saw in the late
1980s, but Japanese companies will still need to go overseas to survive,'
says an official. The high yen is also prompting Japanese companies to shift
production outside Japan. Meanwhile, opportunities lie in industries in a
consolidation phase, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, computer software,
car parts, and foods.
Dealing with smaller companies may not be as straightforward as dealing with
the more sophisticated, larger, Japanese companies. Last month Mikuni and
Nippon Carbureter, two carburettor companies, suddenly announced the
cancellation of their planned merger.
Car parts makers are being hit by sharp production cuts in the car industry,
and the leading carmakers' shift of production to overseas plants. However,
at the last minute Nippon Carbureter decided to cancel the merger as a
result of opposition by some over-zealous board members.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (2): Bank
financing is back - The New York scene is flourishing again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT may not compare with the frenzy of the late 1980s, but the mergers and
acquisitions business in the US is flourishing this year.
As of August 23, almost 4,000 mergers, acquisitions and purchases of
minority stakes worth a total of Dollars 137.8bn had been completed in the
US; a big improvement on last year. So big, in fact, that the total for the
first eight months of 1993 has already surpassed the Dollars 137.5bn (5,500
deals) racked up in all of 1992.
This is good news for Wall Street's M&amp;A bankers. For two and a half years
they have watched their counterparts in booming securities underwriting,
sales and trading businesses grab all the glory. Yet even if the hectic pace
in M&amp;A is maintained for the rest of the year, 1993 will still fall short of
1988, when almost 4,000 deals worth Dollars 348.6bn were completed - the
peak of the 1980s merger mania.
To the delight of the investment banking community, there have been some
very large transactions among this year's crop of US deals. They include the
Dollars 12.6bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph; the Dollars 6bn acquisition of Medco Containment
Services by the drugs giant Merck; the Dollars 4.3bn purchase of a 20 per
cent stake in MCI Communications by UK telecoms group BT; and the Dollars
1.4bn stock-swap merger between Home Shopping Network and its rival the QVC
channel. After four years of decline (see table), it looks as if the M&amp;A
business has turned the corner.
There are several reasons for the turnaround. By the end of the 1980s,
companies were overburdened with debt, much of it raised at expensive rates
during the M&amp;A boom. Since then, aided by the lowest interest rates in more
than three decades and a recession that forced companies to take drastic
action, US corporations have been cleaning up their balance sheets - paying
off costly debt with cheaper funds raised through equity issues or sales of
low-interest debt.
With much of the debt restructuring out of the way, companies are in a
better position to consider making deals again. As Mr Jack Levy, co-head of
M&amp;A at Merrill Lynch in New York, puts it:
'Companies feel their balance sheets are in order, and more importantly,
they feel that the current level of cash flows are robust. Hence, they
believe if they were to assume new leverage, they've got a level of
confidence in the underlying cash flow necessary to support an acquisition.'
Similarly, the economic and business background has improved enough to spur
corporations into action. At the start of this year there was a lot of
pent-up demand for deals from companies which had lain low during the
recession and the faltering recovery.
Once it was clear that the economic recovery was established, interest rates
were staying low, and business confidence was beginning to rebound,
companies revived plans previously kept on the back burner.
Also, changes within companies, such as the introduction of rigorous cost
containment programmes and efficiency drives, are complete, leaving
management ready to build through acquisitions. As one M&amp;A banker says: 'A
lot of these strategic deals we've seen have been in the works for some
time.'
The strength of domestic stock markets (at record highs throughout the
summer) has also helped. High stock prices means acquiring companies have
been able to use their own equity as financing. This has a down side - high
stock prices also mean that companies are more costly to acquire.
The overall pool of financing capital, not just equity, has been growing. In
particular, bank financing is back. Banks, coming off two of the most
profitable years in their history, have put many of their troubles behind
them, and are beginning to lend again.
Investors and shareholders have played their part in providing liquidity for
the M&amp;A recovery. Institutional investors hungry for decent returns on
assets have been putting the money into deals and the once-shunned buyout
funds. Shareholders have been forcing management to divest non-essential
operations and focus attention and capital on core businesses. The result
has been a growing number of mergers and de-mergers.
The rally in the high-yield market has also made it easier for companies to
raise funds for deal-based expansion, and helped breathe new life into
leveraged buyouts - which at one point looked as if they had been killed off
as a form of deal-financing by the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert and
the junk bond market in the late 1980s.
Specialist buyout firms have also returned, adding another source of
liquidity. When British Petroleum recently sold its animal feed business, 30
financial firms joined in the bidding; the eventual winner was an investor
group led by the Houston buyout firm the Sterling Group, which paid a hefty
Dollars 425m for the BP unit.
Despite the delight at the revival of M&amp;A business, no one compares today to
the 1980s. Much has changed, not least the nature of the deals. The big
theme this year has been companies making deals for solid, strategic and
industry-specific reasons. Growth, market share, efficiency, and a need to
be prepared for regulatory and structural changes have been the driving
forces behind many deals.
Many industries, for example, are undergoing or face radical change. This is
most notable in the telecommunications and healthcare businesses, where many
of the biggest deals have occurred.
In the telecoms industry, AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw, US West's purchase of
a 25 per cent stake in Time Warner's cable and film business for Dollars
2.5bn, and BT's purchase of a big stake in MCI, were all about companies
readying themselves for technological and structural change.
It has been a similar story in the healthcare industry. Columbia Hospital
Corporation's Dollars 4.2bn acquisition of Galen Health Care, and Merck's
purchase of Medco, were two deals concluded against the background of an
impending revolution in the form of President Clinton's healthcare reform
package.
The chief feature of this year's crop of M&amp;A deals has been the absence of
hostile takeover. This is partly a reflection of changing attitudes among
corporate managers, and partly because the aggressive takeover advisers of
the 1980s, like Wasserstein Perella and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, are lying
low.
The big question now is: how long can it last? A few factors are conspiring
to keep the M&amp;A business in check.
Chief among these is competition from the buoyant public market. Companies
that might normally put themselves up for sale have been persuaded by the
booming market in stock offerings to go public rather than resort to the
private deal.
The fragile state of the recovery is also acting as a restraint. Deal-makers
and corporate managers are reluctant to move until they are completely sure
that the economy has entered a phase of long-term solid growth.
Yet, in spite of these reservations, bankers believe that the M&amp;A business
hit bottom last year and is now embarking upon a course of steady expansion.
Mr Levy of Merrill Lynch says:
'My view is that we are at a new level, and that it is likely to be a
sustainable level. Business has been somewhat spasmodic for the last couple
of years, and my sense is that today more companies want to talk, and are
taking seriously the idea of doing something on the buy side or sell side.
That's the best barometer we have. Our backlog is up dramatically in terms
of the number of deals and the quality of deals.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (1):
New-style deals appear - Hostile takeovers are out, joint ventures,
alliances and negotiated deals are in, Tracy Corrigan writes. There has been
a persistent trickle of deals so far this year - and there are new
opportunities in the emerging markets of Asia and eastern Europe

BOOMING stock markets and low interest rates spell better times for the
international mergers and acquisitions business. Although no one expects
activity to return to the frenetic pace seen in the 1980s, some recovery in
the volume of traditional M&amp;A deals is becoming apparent.
While the lucrative fees earned by hostile takeovers are not expected to
return, there are new types of business for banks, more suited to the
business cycle of the 1990s. There has been 'a shift from very
transaction-oriented business in the 1980s, back to a
relationship-orientation,' says Mr Stephen Waters, head of investment
banking in Europe and co-head of Morgan Stanley International.
There will also be 'less expansion into new business areas, more building-up
of core business,' says Mr Richard Sapp, a managing director of M&amp;A at
Goldman Sachs.
The increase in international competition, as barriers between markets have
fallen, has focused business leaders' attention. It has become more
difficult for companies to compete on an international scale, forcing them
to be more alert to opportunities to plug geographical holes.
Large companies expanding overseas are looking for acquisitions which fit
strategically with their main business and provide economies of scale which
help cope with the strains of operating internationally They are keen to
look at options other than acquisition, such as joint ventures.
But those companies which are starting to look round for strategic
acquisitions remain very cautious about paying over the odds.
'The main question is: does this make sense strategically. Companies want
first to pay less premium, and second to bind economic interests together,'
says Mr Piers von Simson, a director of Warburg.
Sentiment continues to turn against the conglomerate, as companies take the
view that in order to remain competitive they need to focus on their core
business. Some companies are still de-gearing, after building up debt too
rapidly in the 1980s; this may involve divestitures, or 'unbundling'. 'There
has been a lot of restructuring in Europe,' says Mr Stephen Brisby, head of
corporate finance at UBS, which consists in part of 'undoing things that
were done in the 1970s and 1980s.'
In the US and the UK, the process of unbundling in order to refocus on core
business is well under way, but there is likely to be a substantial growth
in activity in continental Europe in the next few years.
The most important demerger of the year was ICI's flotation of its
pharmaceuticals division to form a new company, Zeneca. The move was
followed by Pearson, which is demerging its Royal Doulton china company in
order to concentrate on its media and publishing interests. Other similar
deals are expected to follow.
'Companies with disparate businesses are asking themselves whether they are
worth more together or apart,' says Mr von Simson. 'In Europe, there are a
lot of conglomerate holding companies, which trade at a discount, like
investment trusts.'
He thinks that UK and US companies have been forced to re-evaluate their
structure at an earlier stage because they went into a cyclical downturn
earlier - and generally have more vocal shareholders.
But, as the ownership of shares in European companies becomes increasingly
international, the focus on share price performance and dividend growth is
also set to increase.
Many prominent continental European companies are still run as conglomerates
 -for example, Daimler-Benz, which runs not only a car and aerospace
business but also a washing machine manufacturer.
The growing competitiveness brought about by the breakdown in barriers
between markets in capital-intensive industries has also fuelled activity as
leading companies seek to consolidate their positions.
'In publishing and pharmaceuticals, for example, every opportunity has been
crawled over by the leading companies in the sector,' says Mr von Simson.
Pressures for consolidation are also set to increase in the banking and
insurance sectors across Europe. Mr Waters at Morgan Stanley says that there
has been a blurring of the lines between some industries, such as insurance
and banking, and media and technology. For example, there have been deals
between telecommunications and computer hardware and software companies.
Privatised utilities in the UK are proving themselves keen to expand
overseas. For example, the water companies are moving into pollution control
and the electricity generators are buying overseas electricity companies.
The consolidation of the airline industry also still has some way to go: the
most important deal currently in the making is the joint venture of four
European airlines, SAS, KLM, Swissair, and Austrian Airlines .
But the European single market has not proved as great a catalyst as
predicted, although a number of sectors, such as insurance, have seen
pan-European consolidation.
The European super-company has not materialised, but links such as Renault
and Volvo and Reed and Elsevier may point the way. However, some bankers
think that joint ventures are inherently unstable and will either lead to
full scale integration - as in the case of Renault and Volvo - or collapse.
In continental Europe there are many smaller family-owned companies under
pressure to expand their businesses in order to compete, but with no access
to the necessary capital. Increasing numbers of such companies are likely to
go public, or to be sold off to larger groups, bankers believe - although
the process has already lagged behind their expectations.
Throughout Europe, a wave of privatisations is about to break - with an
estimated price tag of more than Dollars 100bn over the next four or five
years, according to Morgan Stanley Research. Although most governments claim
to be ideologically motivated, a crucial factor is that the receipts from
privatisation will help plug the worsening budget deficits faced by most
European countries.
'There is not a country in Europe which is not contemplating some form of
privatisation of its telecommunications industry,' says Mr von Simson. 'The
capital requirements are enormous. How will the Bundespost be able to
finance the modernisation of former East Germany's telecommunications
system, at a cost of DM60bn?'
Analysts are also predicting more airline, railway and toll road
privatisations. As the process of privatisation becomes more sophisticated -
for example, governments can choose between selling off companies, or stakes
in companies, publicly or to other companies - the role of investment
bankers has increased.
Bankers are also giving increasing attention to the emerging markets, which
are expected to be a source of growing activity. Some Latin American deals
have already taken place, most notably the acquisition by Cemex, Mexico's
cement company, of Spain's two largest cement companies.
But the developing markets in the Far East are the subject of the greatest
enthusiasm among bankers, particularly China, where the combination of the
shift towards capitalism and the potentially enormous market for
distribution are fuelling interest.
'Europe offers the opportunity to buy into a mature market, and values are
now more attractive, says Mr Sapp at Goldman. 'But the far east is the great
expansion opportunity.'
However, most markets remain highly restrictive in terms of foreign
ownership, or have few sizeable companies.
'The far east may be the market of the future but entry is through
green-field (or start-up) operations because with very few exceptions there
is nothing to buy, or if there is, it is impossible to buy it,' says Mr von
Simson.
But of all the emerging markets, Eastern Europe has proved the most
difficult nut for M&amp;A advisers to crack. Relative to expectations, the level
of activity remains low, and bankers are rather pessimistic about any
immediate improvement in prospects.
Acquisitions are not always the most attractive way to move into Eastern
Europe, according to Mr Klaus Diederichs at JP Morgan. 'In the food
industry, for instance, what you are paying for in an acquisition is brand,
distribution and product - none of these do you get in Eastern Europe.'
After a difficult start to the decade, therefore, the mergers and
acquisitions business appears to be finding a new sense of direction, more
in tune with fundamental economic trends. The growth of business in the
emerging markets, and through large privatisation programmes, has provided
the M&amp;A business with a useful fillip.
The buzzwords of the 1980s - the LBOs (leverage buy-outs) and the HLTs
(highly-leveraged transactions) - have given way to new catch phrases, such
as rationalisation, relationship-banking and core business.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Major scorns Lamont attack as 'sad'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, dismissed Mr Norman Lamont's attack on
the government as 'sad and disingenuous' yesterday, and said speculation
about a leadership challenge was 'silly'.
Mr Major's advisers said the prime minister expected to continue in office
'for years'.
However, rightwing backbenchers said the issue would dominate the party
conference this month. The former chancellor is expected to launch a further
attack on Mr Major at a conference fringe meeting.
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, claimed that Mr Lamont was giving a
public airing to views held privately by ministers who were unable to speak
out. He said the conference would be 'very difficult'.
The prime minister's response to Mr Lamont was echoed by cabinet colleagues,
who condemned the former chancellor's comments, delivered in newspaper
articles. The strongest reaction came from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, who said the sight of 'ex-ministers rewriting history' was
'sickening'.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, claimed that Mr Lamont's comments had
been ignored by regional officials attending a morale-boosting meeting in
Cardiff.
'The issue which has been raised with me is that of loyalty to John Major,
support of John Major as prime minister,' he said. 'There is no question
whatsoever about that.'
Significantly, rightwing ministers also spoke out in support of Mr Major. Mr
Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said much of the debate was 'surreal'.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said it was 'sad that Norman does
think it necessary to continue to comment in this vein'.
However, in a comment reflecting the unease felt in the Tory party, Sir
Marcus Fox - chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, which represents all
Conservative MPs - said it appeared that 'Norman Lamont is going to be a
loose cannon on the back benches'.
Mr Major's strategy is to seek to reduce the impact of the continuing
attacks on his leadership by belittling the credentials of the rebels. Mr
Lamont was described privately as 'embittered' by his dismissal from the
Treasury in May.
Mr Lamont, who refused to comment further, appeared to have succeeded in
establishing himself as a leader of the rightwing Tory Euro-sceptic MPs.
However, his call to the prime minister to rule out British participation in
European monetary union was dismissed by Downing Street as an empty
challenge.
Advisers said the prime minister had repeatedly described the timetable for
monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty as unsustainable.
MPs loyal to Mr Major also sought sought to undermine the effect of Mr
Lamont's remarks by ridiculing his suggestion that Britain required a change
of leadership to prosper.

FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Laporte strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Specialist chemicals group Laporte saw its shares jump 35 to 655p after the
company announced a 15 per cent increase in first-half profits to Pounds
51.3m and a raised dividend.
UBS maintained its buy recommendation and its forecast of Pounds 107m for
the full year on the basis that debt was coming down, the proposed
restructuring would cut costs, and there had been a significant boost from
its Evode subsidiary. However, Hoare Govett feels the share price already
reflects any improvement the company has made and, while nudging its
full-year estimate Pounds 3m higher to Pounds 103m, believes the company is
overvalued.
The telecoms sector rebounded after its recent bout of weakness, most of
which was caused by last week's launch of Mercury's One-2-One cellular
service amid worries that the market would be too competitive.
Cellular telephone group Vodafone, particularly badly hit by the offer from
Mercury of free off-peak calls to private subscribers in the London area,
saw some recovery yesterday. Vodafone shares have dropped by 17 per cent in
the last two weeks and yesterday Henderson Crosthwaite was among brokers
deciding that the fall had been overdone.
Analyst Mr Patrick Hickey said the threat from Mercury had been exaggerated.
'The One-2-One launch takes the cellular market into a new stage of
development,' he said. 'Far from losing market share, we believe Vodafone
will benefit from an expanding market.'
He added that the company's overseas expansion plans also left it well
placed in other markets. Vodafone rose 14 to 493p, Cable and Wireless,
owners of Mercury, gained 8 at 828p and BT put on 3 1/2 at 417 1/2 p.
RMC Group, the building materials company, delivered dull results and the
shares slipped 6 to 793p in steady trading. Its profits declined to Pounds
61.6m from last year's Pounds 62.1m and the dividend was held at 6.6p.
Building specialists had forecast between Pounds 62m and Pounds 69m, with
the dividend expected to rise to 7.1p.
Other building materials groups fell in sympathy. Redland lost 12 to 535p,
Spring Ram 2 to 62p, Hepworth 8 to 377p and Heywood Williams 7 to 347p.
In a dull property sector, Moorfield Estates gained 4 at 45p after
announcing a rights issue to help fund a Pounds 13m deal with British Land.
The latter shed 7 to 380p.
Glaxo climbed 12 to 636p on talk of an upgrade by Salomon Brothers. However,
the house said it had raised forecasts earlier when the results were
announced last week.
New Frontiers Development Trust moved ahead 11 to 100p after Credit Lyonnais
Laing placed the 75 per cent stake - some 75m shares - owned by the Merchant
Navy Officers Pension Fund at 94p a share with institutions. The main buyer
was Foreign and Colonial, which took 30m.
A positive annual meeting at Tomkins continued to boost the shares, with a
BZW recommendation also helping the stock add 9 at 237p.
Among transport issues, SG Warburg was said to be positive on British
Airways, which improved 3 to 358p. Figures at the top end of expectations
from Associated British Ports sent the stock 16 ahead to 452p.
British Aerospace was back in favour yesterday after the previous day's
slide of 26p which followed the disappointing interim figures and sharp
profits downgrades.
The change of mood started with Wednesday evening's meeting with
institutions at Hoare Govett, the company's broker. Bargain hunting was also
in evidence and BAe shares bounced 15 to 409p, with volume reaching 2.9m.
TI Group, which retreated on Wednesday in sympathy with BAe, recovered 4 to
344p.
APV shed 1 1/2 to 97p as analysts downgraded full-year expectations after it
reported a 59 per cent fall in interim profits to Pounds 4.9m. NatWest
Securities was among houses that reduced profits expectations, cutting its
forecast for the full year by Pounds 7m to Pounds 15m.
Tyre and exhaust group Kwik-Fit added 4 1/2 at 172 1/2 p on bumper interim
profits.
USM-quoted Bluebird Toys rose 13 to 451p after leaping nearly 90p earlier in
the week. The market was enthused by a promotional deal with MacDonalds, the
hamburger chain, and a sharp rise in profits.

FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for UB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing results from United Biscuits sent the shares into decline to
close 9 down at 353p in turnover of 5.5m. Profits came in at the bottom of
market expectations and the lack of increase in the dividend compounded
investors' disgruntlement. UB blamed the difficulty of passing on higher raw
material costs, which suppressed margins.
Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull, who cut his forecast for the full year
from Pounds 200m to Pounds 171m, said trading conditions in the second half
would remain difficult. He added that the current uncertainties surrounding
the stock demanded a yield of around 6 per cent, implying a share price of
330p.

<TEXT>
Arthur Andersen, the administrator of Mirror Group Newspapers, acted to
defuse speculation over the sale of its 54.8 per cent stake yesterday by
announcing that it was preparing the details for a placing in the market.
The stake, which represents some 220m shares, will be sold by Rothschild,
Andersen's financial advisers, and Cazenove. The two firms will be joined by
NatWest Securities, James Capel and SG Warburg.
Mr John Talbot of Andersen said: 'In view of the success of the new
management team in restoring MGN's fortunes and in removing a number of
uncertainties overhanging the company' he was planning an offering of up to
all the stake 'subject to appropriate market conditions'.
No idea of price, date or method of placing was released but the appointment
of so many leading securities houses to handle the sale implies that the
timing and details will be well flagged before the placing takes place.
Mirror Group slipped 5 to 181p yesterday.

FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons pleases

<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was an immediate positive response to the announcement from Dixons
that it was diluting its interest in its loss-making US subsidiary Silo - a
move which has long been urged on the electrical group by London analysts.
Evidence of the welcome afforded by investors was seen in the stock's
biggest turnover in more than three years at 15m. Dixons advanced 27 to
260p.
BZW upgraded its profits forecast for the current year from Pounds 78m to
Pounds 86m as a result of the move. However, Mr Tony Sherat, the broker's
stores specialist, said he remained cautious on the stock, citing doubts
over the quality of earnings and the threat of increased competition in the
UK. Under yesterday's deal, Dixons will cede control of Silo to Fretter in
return for a minority stake in the US retailer.

FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shock for LIG shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DRAMATIC profits warning from London International Group, the condom
manufacturer and photo processor, sent a wave of embarrassment through the
investment community yesterday and the share price plunged by a third,
ending 63 down at 140p.
LIG said it expected its half-year results to be 'very severely depressed
compared with last year' and added that Mr Tony Butterworth, the chief
executive, was taking early retirement. It said the main problem was in the
troubled photo-processing arm. That section normally makes its profits in
the first half, which covers the summer months when most photos are taken,
and is now set to make a loss.
The company was censured by the Stock Exchange in May for leaking a profits
warning into the market earlier in the year. That warning knocked the shares
and afterwards a number of analysts felt that the problems had then been
discounted in the share price. Enthusiasm was buoyed by full-year results at
the end of June when the company said its main business was resilient to
recession.
Most analysts were crouching behind their screens yesterday but Mr Peter
Laing of Salomon Brothers confessed: 'I was a great fan of Tony Butterworth
and had certainly hoped that the photo business would turn around. This has
been a real shock.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities calm ahead of futures expiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALMER session in both stock index futures and equities saw the FT-SE 100
Index recover the 3,000 mark yesterday, to the relief of market analysts.
There was an easing of the pressures of the expiry this morning of the
September Footsie future contract which lay behind much of the setback in
share prices in the previous session. By the close the futures contract was
nearly in line with the underlying market, in readiness for today's expiry.
The latest UK employment data made little impression, nor did the market
respond to political nervousness over criticism of government policy by Mr
Norman Lamont, former chancellor of the exchequer. Corporate developments
provided the features and underlined the market's apparent readiness to
trade at current levels. The most inspiring, if not the most unexpected,
came from the confirmation that the administrator of Mirror Group Newspapers
is ready to offer his 55 per cent stake.
A slow start saw share prices at first continue the uncertainty which has
plagued them for the past two weeks. Progress was slow but, closely
mirroring the stock index futures contract, the Footsie recaptured 3,000 in
mid-afternoon.
Equities were helped by a firmer trend in UK government bonds and in other
European equity markets. The second half of the session held steady but
without providing excitement. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at
3,003.9 for a net gain on the day of 14.5 points. London brushed aside a
sluggish start on Wall Street, down 7 Dow points in UK hours.
Trading volume was relatively high, although yesterday's Seaq total of
668.6m shares fell below the 741.9m of the previous day. Retail, or
customer, business was worth Pounds 1.5bn on Wednesday, confirming that
profit-taking had been significant, but not particularly alarming.
Analysts' views on this week's shakeout were summed up by Mr Trevor
Laugharne at Kleinwort Benson, who said that the fall below Footsie 3,000
should not cause undue alarm, and reflected mildly negative forces rather
than 'the first hoof beat from the horsemen of the Apocalypse'. Kleinwort
'welcomes a healthy correction' and stays with its belief that the Footsie
is likely to fall to a support level of around 2,970.
Although the rally in government bonds was very modest, confidence on base
rate cut prospects recovered. Consequently, there were significant rallies
among the interest-related issues, with retail stores generally adding a few
pence. The sector was helped by a successful deal in the US by Dixons, the
British high street electronics retailer.
Wall Street's firmness overnight, together with a steadier one in the
currency markets, enabled the blue chip international stocks to stage a
recovery. Pharmaceuticals and oil shares, both heavily-weighted components
of UK market indices, found support.
Second line issues remained under a cloud, however, as would-be sellers
still found it hard to find buyers for stock taken aboard at the market's
peak. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a broad range of non-Footsie stocks,
dipped 2.9 points to 3,421.2.
While some turmoil in share prices is possible this morning during the
futures expiry, dealers' nerves seemed much steadier last night.

FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST full day of trading ahead of this morning's expiry of both the
Footsie September future and index traded options turned out to be a much
calmer and less hectic session, with signs that dealers had already unwound
positions, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September FT-SE 100 futures contract started trading at 2,992 yesterday,
at a slight discount to cash, but quickly declined by a further 8 points as
several small sell orders were executed. This done, September moved steadily
ahead, gaining a modest premium to cash.
Volume was good, but with most of the traders having made an effort to
square their books earlier in the week, there was little in the way of
basket trading. In spite of today's expiry, the forward month contract
continued as the most liquid, showing nearly double the volume recorded in
the December contract, which assumes market leadership on Monday. Turnover
in September at the official close was 8,029 lots and that in December was
4,625.
The near month contract finished at 3,003, leaving a 2-point premium to
cash.
In traded options, volume remained healthy, reaching 36,467. The FT-SE 100
option traded 14,092 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE saw business of 2,413
lots.
Among the stock options, Glaxo led the way in the activities list with a
total of 2,447 lots transacted.

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic news checks rally by
US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets failed to build on Wednesday's late rally yesterday, share
prices ending flat to lower after subdued trading, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.80 off at 3,630.85. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 dipped 2.17 to 459.43, but the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.25 to
739.80. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 229.7m shares.
Although share prices rebounded strongly on Wednesday afternoon as buyers
moved into the market in the wake of heavy losses, there was no
follow-through from that late rally yesterday, and prices softened from the
opening. Sentiment was not helped by the day's economic news. Industrial
production rose only 0.2 per cent in August, weekly jobless claims increased
by 2,000, and the July trade deficit narrowed slightly as both export and
import sales weakened.
The data painted a picture of an economy still struggling to achieve
anything more than very modest rates of growth. Stocks were not helped by
the bond market, which posted fresh declines after an upbeat opening.
Analysts said that investors continue to believe that the correction in both
stock and bond markets is far from complete.
Among individual sectors, the golds group was one of the few bright spots,
thanks to a rebound in bullion prices. Newmont Mining rose Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 46 5/8 , Newmont Gold put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 40 1/4 and
Battle Mountain Gold added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 8. Placer Dome,
meanwhile, advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 1/8 in volume of 2m shares
after the company estimated that 4.8m ounces of gold may lie within its 70
per cent-owned Venezuelan property.
Drug shares were weaker as a group, with Schering-Plough slipping Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 61 7/8 , Merck Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 1/2 , Pfizer
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 60 1/8 and Bristol Myers-Squibb Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 57 7/8 .
Shares in Wang Laboratories, the computer group currently in Chapter 11
bankruptcy, dropped Dollars  3/16 to Dollars  3/8 in heavy trading on
reports that under its soon-to-be-announced financial restructuring the
company's stock will be cancelled and replaced with warrants that give the
shares a value near to zero.
Showboat jumped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 19 5/8 after brokerage house
Oppenheimer initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating and forecast
strong earnings for the next two years.
SPX climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 17 3/8 on news that its Sealed Power
Replacement unit is being acquired by Federal-Mogul for Dollars 150m in cash
and bank debt.
Canada
TORONTO was higher in hectic trade as a rally by gold shares boosted the
market.
The TSE 300 index finished 20.2 ahead at 3,988.1 and advances led declines
by 393 to 313 after volume of 86.6m shares valued at CDollars 604.2m.
Eight of the 14 sub-group indices gained ground, led by the golds group,
which added 4.2 per cent as the bullion price in New York climbed USDollars
5 to USDollars 352.75 an ounce.

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: European turnover continues to advance
 -The holiday season failed to dampen enthusiasm in August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European bourses saw turnover rise for the third successive month in August,
although the pace of increase slowed as the holiday season got under way,
after the strong advances of the previous two months.
Volume rose by 5 per cent from July levels after the month-on-month
increases of 20.8 per cent in July and 20.3 per cent in June.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which produces the turnover figures,
notes that the rise in August accompanied a 6.3 per cent advance in the FT-A
Europe index during the month, with only share market indices for Belgium
showing a decline.
The biggest gainers in turnover were the markets with the steepest growth in
the local index, propelled by hopes of an accelerating fall in interest
rates following the EMS crisis at the beginning of the month,' he says.
However, he notes that turnover on Seaq International, the London
screen-based trading system, increased by only 2.7 per cent on the month for
the seven continental European markets, indicating relatively greater
interest by domestic investors in trading in their local markets.
Italy made the biggest gain in August, with turnover up by 32.8 per cent to
a record level, in spite of the unravelling political scandal. This
represented a 64.9 per cent increase over the average for the previous three
months for a market which saw a 12.1 per cent rise in local market stock
indices over the month.
Mr Michele Pacitti of NatWest Securities notes that daily trading turnover
had topped L600bn throughout much of the month, compared with last year's
unusually low level of less than L100bn, when the country was beset by
worries about a burgeoning budget deficit.
This year, there had been a marked improvement in foreign demand as the
economic outlook had improved on the back of interest rates that had fallen
from 15 per cent to 8 1/2 per cent.
The government's privatisation programme had also provoked much interest,
since it was an indication of the administration's determination to tackle
its budget deficit difficulties, and it also showed that the country was
serious about tackling inefficiency and low productivity in industry.
Spain saw the second largest increase in turnover, up 19.1 per cent from
July and 4 per cent above the average of the previous three months. But
turnover was well below the record level set in May. The market index,
meanwhile, rose 12.3 per cent to an all-time peak, activity spurred by
recurring hopes throughout the month for lower interest rates.
Continuing expectations of lower rates also underpinned France, where
turnover climbed by 17.1 per cent on the month as the local market index
advanced 7.3 per cent to an historic high. The rise on the month took volume
23.9 per cent higher than the average of the previous three months.
UK turnover expanded by 10.7 per cent to a level not seen since October
1987, the month in which the Black Monday market crash occurred. German
turnover fell by 2.3 per cent after its 43.2 per cent rise in July, while
Swiss turnover was down 8.9 per cent on the month as the market continued to
underperform Europe.

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pessimism over economic
package depresses Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PESSIMISM over the effects of the government's economic emergency package
depressed sentiment, and the Nikkei average lost 2.1 per cent on
profit-taking and arbitrage unwinding, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average fell 445.64 to 20,502.15 as investors sold ahead of
the economic package's release after the market closed.
The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 20,938.69 but weakened as doubts over
the package mounted. The index dropped to the day's low of 20,501.95 just
before the close.
Volume totalled 261.2m shares, against 305m on Wednesday. Declines
overwhelmed advances by 867 to 173, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks retreated 23.24 to 1,657.09. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 Index eased 0.03 to 1,268.82.
Investors focused on gloomy news regarding the economy, and were discouraged
by the annualised 2 per cent negative growth of GNP during the April-June
quarter, announced on Tuesday.
Speculation that the emergency package lacked measures which would have an
immediate effect on the economy also disappointed market participants.
Meanwhile, some institutional investors liquidated their portfolios to boost
profits ahead of the September book closing, while the fall in stocks
prompted margin liquidation by individuals.
Profit-taking hit steels. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day,
fell Y10 to Y336 and NKK lost Y3 to Y282.
Banks were lower on index-linked selling. Industrial Bank of Japan weakened
Y30 to Y3,460, Sumitomo Bank Y60 to Y2,270 and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking
Y30 to Y1,460.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which had been higher on hopes about
government investment in telecommunication infrastructure, shed Y15,000 to
Y891,000. The stock fell below the Y900,000 level for the first time since
July 28, as the likelihood that the plan would be included in the package
diminished.
Electric power companies lost ground in spite of the higher yen. The
emergency package is expected to include measures to pass on the benefits of
the high yen to consumers through a reduction of electricity and gas prices.
Tokyo Electric Power slipped Y60 to Y3,420 and Kansai Electric Power Y50 to
Y2,850.
Shochiku, the movie production and distribution company, was one of the few
bright spots of the day, rising Y20 to Y1,280 on reports that it would team
up with Sega Enterprises, the video game company, to develop new multimedia
software.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 248.06 to 22,715.91 in volume of 80.6m
shares.
Roundup
THE LARGER markets on the Pacific Rim weakened yesterday.
HONG KONG fell sharply on disappointment over the latest round of
Sino-British talks.
The Hang Seng index dropped 70.66 to 7,418.11, fin-ishing just 10 points
above the day's low. Turnover was HKDollars 2.9bn.
Among blue chips, HSBC declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 81, Hutchison
Whampoa lost 30 cents to HKDollars 23.10 and Jardine Matheson shed HKDollars
1.50 to HKDollars 62. Brokers said property issues were hit hard on the
uncertain outlook for real estate. Cheung Kong fell 30 cents to HKDollars
27, HK Land dipped 30 cents to HKDollars 17.10 and Sun Hung Kai Properties
was down 25 cents at HKDollars 38.25.
SEOUL declined for the third consecutive session in a day of lacklustre
trading and the composite stock index finished 5.05 down at 686.39 in
turnover of Won205.2bn.
TAIWAN continued to fall back but closed off its intraday low. The weighted
index, which had dropped more than 40 points at one stage, closed a net
17.09 off at 3,765.01, its lowest finish since February 11. Turnover was
TDollars 11.3bn.
MANILA advanced on heavy buying of blue chips and secondary issues and
renewed interest in mines. The composite index rose 23.57 to 1,975.73.
Turnover shrank to 593.8m pesos from Wednesday's 1.4bn pesos. Rises
outscored falls by 84 to 22.
AUSTRALIA remained weak, but with attention concentrated on Amcor, up 35
cents, or 4 per cent, at ADollars 9.24, following its announcement on Monday
that it is to buy the paper manufacturing and distribution assets of North
Broken Hill Peko for ADollars 415m.
The All Ordinaries index closed 1.0 lower on balance at 1,902.6, after
opening 6.8 up.
Turnover amounted to ADollars 373.3m as the golds index jumped 52.4 to
1,796.2 after bullion prices improved.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: John Lewis interim profit falls to Pounds
16.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM profits at John Lewis Partnership, the employee-owned department
store and supermarket group, fell for the fifth successive year, in spite of
a better than expected performance from the Waitrose chain.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 were Pounds 16.4m, down from
Pounds 18.2m. Last year's figure was restated downwards from Pounds 20.2m,
after John Lewis was advised by its actuaries in the second half that it
should increase its pension contributions.
That increased first-half pension costs from Pounds 5.7m for the first half
of 1992 to Pounds 7.7m this time.
A further increase in pension costs this year to Pounds 8.7m accounted for
much of the fall in trading profit, after pension costs, to Pounds 28.5m
from Pounds 30.3m.
First-half taxable profits at the group have collapsed from more than Pounds
50.8m in 1988, although the rate of decline slowed this year. The group,
which has 22 department stores and 105 Waitrose supermarkets, has been hit
hard by recession, and by increasing competition, especially in the grocery
market.
Waitrose has been hampered by its refusal to trade on Sundays and its
slowness in introducing new technology, and has expanded less rapidly than
its competitors because of its inability to raise capital on the stock
market.
Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman, said that any fall in the bottom line was
unwelcome. However, the decline of only Pounds 0.8m in trading profits
before pension costs showed how successful the group had been in containing
costs and boosting sales.
Group turnover increased from Pounds 1.09bn to Pounds 1.13bn. Sales
increased 6 per cent to Pounds 532.5m in the department stores. Sales at
Waitrose increased 1 per cent to Pounds 577.3m, in contrast to the fall that
had been forecast, but profits were hit by one-off costs associated with
improving the distribution network and introducing scanning in the stores.
Sales in the wholesaling and manufacturing division fell 11 per cent to
Pounds 17.6m.
Mr Hampson warned that the second half would be 'challenging', but trading
in the last six weeks had exceeded estimates.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: SHT cuts debts to Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continuing efforts of Scottish Heritable Trust, the York-based
conglomerate, to cut debt resulted in borrowings falling from Pounds 33.8m
to Pounds 25m over the six months to June 30.
The prime objective remains debt reduction and since the period end, the
sale of Fox Ridge Homes Inc has been agreed for Dollars 8.7m (Pounds 5.6m).
For the six months to the end of June, pre-tax losses increased from Pounds
2.9m to Pounds 6.33m after costs concerning the sale of businesses of Pounds
4.79m (Pounds 584,000 profits). Taking out the exceptional costs left losses
of Pounds 1.5m which the company said was a significant improvement.
The company blamed the losses on the high interest burden. The charge for
the period was down from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 1.13m.
Turnover was Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 2.44m) for continuing activities with a
further Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 20.4m) from discontinued. Losses per share were
17.7p (8.1p).
For the future the company, where Mr Roger Shute, formerly of BM Group, is
temporary chief executive, said that its offshoots were still finding
trading difficult.
'Unless there is a remarkable turnaround in the property market in the next
few months, group trading results for the remainder of the year are unlikely
to show any material signs of improvement.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pict Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production group, saw net
profit for the year to June 30 rise 63 per cent to Pounds 4.82m on turnover
of Pounds 9.58m, compared with 1992 figures of profit of Pounds 2.96m on
turnover of Pounds 10.8m.
The results were helped by currency gains of Pounds 1.57m (losses Pounds
482,000) because of the stronger dollar and higher net interest received of
Pounds 837,000 (Pounds 537,000).
The fall in turnover was mainly attributable to the disposal of the interest
in the Claymore field. The average price rose to Pounds 11.1 per barrel
(Pounds 10.54).
Earnings per share were 9.34p, against 6.65p.

British Mohair Holdings reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.02m to

figure to be similar to the previous Pounds 2.1m.
Mr Charles Fenton, chairman, said activity in the group's textile companies

hand-knitting sector. Non-textile operations showed a marginal improvement.
At present, demand for textile products showed no appreciable change, while
the specialised engineering activities were expected to continue to trade
satisfactorily.
First-half turnover edged ahead from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 19.78m, while
earnings per share slipped to 4.48p (5.22p). The interim dividend has been

SHARES IN International Food Machinery, which came to the market last
December, jumped 9p to 80p yesterday after the company reported a surge in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 878,000 for the first half of 1993. This compared
with Pounds 292,000 last time which was after Pounds 128,000 losses from
discontinued activities.
Turnover of this food processing and refrigeration equipment concern grew to
Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 3.39m) and earnings per share reached 5.98p (1.68p). An
interim dividend of 1.4p has been declared.
The company said that following its attendance at an exhibition in Iran, a
substantial number of orders were taken for which deposits had been
received. However, because of the time taken to complete these transactions,
profits on these would arise in the second half.
Turnover in Australia had increased considerably and orders achieved and
anticipated from a major trade show in that country were likely to have a
very positive effect in the current year.

Logica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES IN North America and the Far East contributed to a lacklustre full
year performance by Logica, the computing services group.
Profits before tax for the year to June 30 were Pounds 9.03m, a 28 per cent
increase on the previous Pounds 7.1m, but slightly below market
expectations. The shares fell 1p to 254p.
Revenues rose 9 per cent to Pounds 217.4m (Pounds 200.4m). The tax rate was
up slightly to 41.65 per cent as a result of unrelieved losses in the US,
leaving earnings per share 24 per cent ahead at 8.7p (7p). A final dividend
of 2.75p will be paid giving a total for the year of 4p, an increase of 10
per cent.
Cash was strong at Pounds 17m (Pounds 13.7m), the result of continuing tight
management controls.
The company performed well in the UK where operating profits grew by 31 per
cent to Pounds 9.2m and gross margins improved to 7.1 per cent (5.8 per
cent). Continental Europe, where the company lost Pounds 1.7m last year,
improved to profits of Pounds 2.6m.
The company lost Pounds 2.6m in North America through set backs in the
telecommunications sector and a sharp decline in Logica's business with the
large computer vendors. The result was a 'major disappointment' said Mr
Martin Read, the newly appointed chief executive: 'We cannot go on as we
have in the past three or four years. North America has got to be sorted
out'.
In the Far East, the company lost Pounds 300,000 chiefly as a result of
overspending on a large fixed price project for the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange.
COMMENT
Logica's results are not bad, but they are not good enough. The difficulties
in the US and Asia cannot disguise the fact that a company with its strength
in technology and its formidable customer list should be at least twice as
profitable. Mr Read, formerly a high flyer with GEC Marconi, has been
brought in to bring new aggression and focus to Logica's market presence. He
intends to find ways of make more productive use of the company's skills and
experience, but it will take time to change the culture and boost
profitability. On a historic p/e of about 29, the shares seem fairly valued.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Moorfield Pounds 13m buy as losses fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOORFIELD Estates, the USM-quoted property trader and investor, yesterday
unveiled a package comprising a Pounds 13m acquisition, a placing and open
offer and additional banking facilities.
It also reported a cut in pre-tax losses from Pounds 774,000 to Pounds
244,000 for the six months to end-June.
The acquisition is a portfolio of 10 properties from British Land for a cash
consideration of Pounds 12.84m. The properties have been valued by
Chesterton at Pounds 13.3m.
The placing and open offer of 21.62m new ordinary shares at 37p will raise
about Pounds 8m before expenses. Some Pounds 3.9m will be used to finance
part of the acquisition, a further Pounds 800,000 will repay short term
loans and Pounds 2.9m will provide funds for further property purchases and
working capital.
There is a clawback for existing shareholders on a 2-for-1 basis. The shares
closed 4p higher at 45p.
Moorfield has also entered into a new five-year loan agreement with the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in connection with the acquisition
which will provide a further Pounds 10.9m. Of this, about Pounds 9.1m will
be used to fund the remainder of the acquisition. The balance will be used
to refinance certain existing short term loans.
At least Pounds 1m of the loan is to repaid by October 1995 from the
proceeds of property sales.
The portfolio being acquired has a current rental income of Pounds 1.31m,
giving a yield of 10.2 per cent on the purchase price.
The new shares have been conditionally placed by NatWest Wood Mackenzie, the
company's brokers. An extraordinary meeting to seek shareholder approval of
the acquisition and placing and open offer has been convened for October 11.
The reduction in interim losses was mainly attributable to an increase in
rental income to Pounds 881,000 (Pounds 774,000), a cut in interest payable
to Pounds 751,000 (Pounds 945,000) and lower administration expenses of
Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 365,000).
Losses per share were cut to 2.23p (9.01p).
Subject to approval being received for the acquisition, placing and open
offer a dividend totalling not less than 1p will be paid for 1994 with 0.5p
being paid as an interim in September of that year.
The last dividend payment was 0.1p for the 1991 year.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Redrow chairman says worst is over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN LINE with its forecast at the time of its acquisition of Costain Homes,
Redrow Group, the privately-owned housebuilder and construction concern,
raised pre-tax profits by 30 per cent to Pounds 13.3m in the year ended June
30.
Turnover of the group, which paid Pounds 23m in July to acquire Costain's
loss-making UK housebuilding operations, rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 130m.
The result prompted Mr Steve Morgan, the chairman, to predict that the worst
of the recession was over.
He said that although all group companies experienced difficult trading
conditions 'we have hopefully seen the start of a sustained recovery in the
housing market'. Redrow claims to be the UK's largest unquoted housebuilder.
During the year, Redrow's balance sheet strengthened by a further 17 per
cent, reflecting a net worth of Pounds 53.7m, while net year end borrowings
were reduced to Pounds 3.8m, giving a 7 per cent gearing. Following the
Costain purchase however, group borrowings rose to Pounds 21m and gearing to
39 per cent.
Mr Morgan said he expected the housing division to make substantial progress
during the current year. The acquisition of Costain Homes - now trading as
Redrow Homes (South East) - took its number of regional housing operations
to 7 and gave the division a significant presence throughout England and
Wales.
With a land bank of about 6,300 plots, completions approaching 2000 units
were anticipated in the current year.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Associate helps Sirdar rise to Pounds 5.73m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HELPED BY a reduction in interest costs and a larger contribution from its
associate, Sirdar was able to achieve a rise in profits from Pounds 5.05m to
Pounds 5.73m pre-tax for the year to end-June.
The shares responded with a 13p rise to 129p.
Results were a little better than the directors had hoped for. They said the
figures were bolstered by an 'exceptionally good' second half year at
Eversure, the ready-made curtain offshoot.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 51.97m (Pounds 52.03m). The hand knitting
activities ran up an operating loss of Pounds 93,000 (profit Pounds 720,000)
while other textile products achieved a rise in profits of over Pounds 1m at
Pounds 6.08m.
The associate, Acropolis Hotels, chipped in Pounds 284,000 (Pounds 166,000)
to profits while group interest charges were reduced from Pounds 910,000 to
Pounds 547,000.
Acropolis hopes to open a new hotel in 1995.
The final dividend is being lifted to 3.7p (3.5p), raising the total from
5.15p to 5.35p. Earnings worked through 18 per cent ahead at 6.89p.
At the year end group gearing was down from 23 per cent to 9 per cent.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Recession blamed for Dowding fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWDING AND Mills, the electrical and mechanical repair company, said a
third year of recession had cut its full year pre-tax profits from Pounds
5.9m to Pounds 5.04m.
The board proposes a maintained final dividend of 1.58p giving a total for
the year held at 2.5p uncovered by earnings per share of 2.04p (2.65p).
'Although not covered by attributable profits, the total cost of the
dividend at Pounds 3.66m is more than covered by normal trading profits
before deduction of exceptional costs,' Mr Peter Hollings, chairman, said.
Turnover for the year ended June 30 rose to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 74.7m)
almost entirely on the first full year contribution of a US acquisition made
at the end of the previous period.
Pre-tax profits were undermined by redundancy costs of Pounds 423,000
(Pounds 165,000) and a Pounds 628,000 one-off write-down of a near 9 per
cent stake in Torday &amp; Carlisle, the Newcastle-based engineer, for which
Dowding and Mills made an abortive bid, and which has since declined in
value. Last year's Pounds 633,000 charge was for costs incurred in bidding
for Torday.
Operating profits of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 7.31m) included Pounds 857,000 from
the US acquisition.
'Although some sectors of the United Kingdom economy have recently improved,
we have not yet seen any positive upturn in the markets where we operate.'
Mr Hollings said.
Mainland Europe, had had a difficult time, he said, while Australia had been
mixed, with reasonable volumes in the company's Queensland branches, but a
shortage of work in New South Wales.
Tight control of capital expenditure - down to Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 5.9m) -
and of cash, had helped reduce gearing to 18.8 per cent (22.8 per cent).

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Store opening costs hit Era as losses
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COSTS of opening four additional stores were partly responsible for a
near doubling of losses at Era Group, the specialist retailer, to Pounds
2.59m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30.
The deficit, which compared with Pounds 1.66m before, was struck from a
turnover little changed at Pounds 29.2m (Pounds 29.35m). The company is best
known for its Beatties model and toys chain.
A sales deterioration in the opening quarter following a lack of consumer
confidence was compensated for by an improved sales performance in the
second quarter.
The group suffered only a slight erosion of gross margins despite severe
competitive pressures on pricing and the impact of the increased sterling
cost of imported products.
Mr Anthony Fay, the chairman, said the recovery in sales in the second
quarter had continued following improving consumer confidence.
He added that if this trend continued, 'it should prove particularly
advantageous . . . particularly as trading is strongly biased towards
November and December.'
The extra stores were also expected to generate additional sales during the
important Christmas trading period.
Half year losses per share widened from 2.07p to 3.19p.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: AB Ports advances strongly to Pounds 29m -
Property side now well placed to produce a positive contribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Associated British Ports Holdings rose 16p to 452p yesterday on
news of a near-doubling of profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 29.4m pre-tax
for the half year ended June 30.
However, the comparable figure reflected a Pounds 10m property development
provision.
Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said that following the Pounds 83.6m total
provision made in 1992, the property business was well-placed to produce a
positive contribution.
Operating profits from property development were Pounds 1m following a loss
of Pounds 1.6m last time, while profits from property investment rose to
Pounds 5.4m from Pounds 4.5m. Port related property profits contributed
Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 9.8m).
Operating profits from the ports and transport sector were Pounds 28.4m
after taking a Pounds 4m charge for severance payments, mainly at
Southampton Container Terminals, where manpower has been cut from 461 to
349. This was down on last year, when the sector had profits of Pounds 32.5m
after Pounds 2m of severance costs.
Sir Keith said the company now employed 1,800 people at its 22 ports, a
reduction of about two-thirds in 10 years. There would be further severance
costs, he predicted, but nothing like on the same scale.
The amount of cargo in tonnes passing through the ports had remained
constant, said Sir Keith, but an improvement that emerged towards the end of
the half year had been maintained in July and August.
Steel, timber and containers were higher, but coal imports were much lower.
Sir Keith added that the car trade had been strong in both directions.
Production from the Toyota Derby factory was being exported through Grimsby.
Group turnover was slightly ahead at Pounds 108.9m (Pounds 108.1m).
Net interest payments were down to Pounds 17.8m from Pounds 20.8m. The group
had a tax charge of Pounds 7.2m or 24.5 per cent, reflecting capital and
other allowances. Previously tax was Pounds 4.6m, or 30.5 per cent.
Net borrowings were Pounds 359m (Pounds 349m) giving unchanged gearing at 60
per cent.
Earnings per share improved to 11.9p (5.7p), although before the property
development provision last year's earnings were 9.6p. The interim dividend
is being raised from 3.25p to 3.5p.
COMMENT
Clearing the decks with a large property provision might have pushed ABP
into the red last year, but it has enabled a clearer picture to emerge this
year. The group is sensibly planning to concentrate its property investment
business on land near its ports. It also reports good progress with lettings
in the property development side, which has moved out of the red at the
operating level. At the same time income from the ports is holding up well.
The problems with Southampton Container Terminals are over, and from now on
any severance costs should be insignificant. Full-year pre-tax earnings of
around Pounds 60m will give a p/e of about 19 - justifiable if the ports
business continues untouched by European recession and the property business
continues to improve.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Frontiers changes in new name deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW Frontiers Development Trust, the emerging markets investment trust, is
being restructured in a deal which will result in a change of manager and of
name to the Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets Trust.
Shares in the trust rose 11p to 100p yesterday.
The deal involves the disposal of the 75 per cent stake owned by the
Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund and of its holding in the convertible
unsecured loan stock.
Ivory &amp; Sime, which has managed the trust for the past two years, will lose
the management contract which will pass to Foreign &amp; Colonial's newly formed
emerging markets subsidiary. MNOPF owns 16 per cent of Ivory &amp; Sime.
Mr Allan Munro, Ivory &amp; Sime's managing director, said 'it is disappointing
and frustrating to lose the trust after what we've achieved for
shareholders.' He added that when Ivory &amp; Sime took over management, only 52
per cent of the trust had actually been invested in emerging markets - that
proportion is now 92 per cent.
'The discount has narrowed from 25 per cent to 8 per cent,' Mr Munro added.
According to Micropal, the trust was ranked third (out of 7) in the emerging
markets sector over the year to September 1.
The change means the loss of the third largest investment trust run by Ivory
&amp; Sime, which has around Pounds 3.5bn of funds under management. Ivory &amp;
Sime will receive Pounds 511,000 in compensation for termination of the
contract.
The deal will give Foreign &amp; Colonial an investment trust in the emerging
markets field, where it had considering launching a new issue; the
restructuring of New Frontiers will give it an Pounds 100m trust. The annual
fee will be 1.5 per cent, compared with the 0.75 per cent charged by Ivory &amp;
Sime.

<TEXT>
BRITTON Group, the expanding packaging group formed last October, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 520,000 for the first half of 1993 from
a turnover of Pounds 6.39m.
Mr Harry Westropp, chairman, said the results were as expected. The second
half had started satisfactorily with the group benefiting from improved
working capital control resulting in lower than expected interest charges.
Since the period end Britton has acquired TACO, a polythene extruder, funded
by a Pounds 31.4m placing and rights issue, making the group the second
largest polythene extruder in the UK.
Earnings per share for the period were 0.28p. An interim of 0.06p has been
declared.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Increased core demand helps Kwik-Fit to
Pounds 11.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER demand for tyres and exhausts and a third year of stringent cost
control helped Kwik-Fit Holdings report a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
11.5m for the six months to August 31 against Pounds 9.74m.
The company had gained a little market share in the period, Mr Tom Farmer,
chairman, said. 'As long as there's cars on the road and as long as the
consumer has money to spend on the repairs to those cars then we will get a
substantial share of that market.'
Kwik-Fit began its push into the brake replacement market in July. 'Early
indications have shown that this could become an important growth area for
Kwik-Fit and by October of this year we will be in a position to offer and
market this service through 90 per cent of our centres,' Mr Farmer said.
The move is expected to cost about Pounds 2.5m in training and advertising
expenses this year. Kwik-Fit believes the brake replacement market is worth
more than Pounds 500m, twice the value of the current exhaust replacement
market.
Group turnover increased 11 per cent to Pounds 132.1m (Pounds 119.2m) on the
back of increased demand for tyres and exhausts. Operating profits rose 36
per cent to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 9.08m) but the gain at the pre-tax level
was limited by a fall in profits from asset sales to Pounds 207,000 from
Pounds 1.73m.
Capital expenditure fell from Pounds 9m to Pounds 3.3m. Net interest and
other financial charges fell slightly to Pounds 1.06m, compared with Pounds
1.07m.
The board declared an increased interim dividend of 1.5p (1.35p) out of
earnings per share higher at 4.7p, against 3.82p.
COMMENT
Kwik-Fit has done well to gain market share and lift profits in its static
markets and in the face of growing competition from car dealers. There are,
however, challenges to continuing growth. Consumers still prefer lower
margin economy tyres and it will be hard to achieve more than modest growth
in its share of the stable exhaust pipe market it dominates. But the company
and the City have high hopes of its well-timed and inexpensive move into
brakes. But the Netherlands' operations look back on track, making useful
contribution to profits. With pre-tax forecasts about Pounds 21m to Pounds
22m, a multiple of about 20 looks expensive.

THE effects of the recession continued in the first half at Folkes Group,

Mr Constantine J Folkes, the chairman and chief executive, pointed out that

The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 0.575p. Earnings per share

Turnover for the six months to June 30 was virtually unchanged at Pounds

THE STEPS taken last year to restructure management and control costs have
put British Fittings Group back in the black in the six months to June 30.
Despite continuing adverse trading conditions, the group turned in pre-tax
profits of Pounds 672,000, against Pounds 1.02m losses last time. The
results have been prepared according to FRS 3 and comparatives restated.
Turnover in continuing businesses fell 6 per cent to Pounds 34.8m (Pounds
36.96m), but operating profits on these businesses rose by 32 per cent to
Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.09m). The group's activities cover pipeline equipment
distribution, high pressure water products and non-ferrous metals
distribution.
Interest charge for the half year was lower at Pounds 762,000 (Pounds 1.28m)
and after tax of Pounds 70,000 (nil), earnings per share were 1.71p (5.11p
losses). The interim dividend has been raised by 50 per cent to 0.75p
(0.5p).

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: APV declines sharply midway to Pounds 4.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APV, which supplies processing equipment to the food and drink industries,
blamed continuing pressure from competitors on margins for a sharp drop in
its profitability.
The group, which is restructuring after expanding rapidly by acquisition in
the 1980s, said it would accelerate its programme of cutting costs,
disposing of non-core businesses and increasing market penetration in key
areas.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 12m to Pounds 4.9m in the six months to
June 30 on sales which were down from Pounds 437m to Pounds 417m. Turnover
of continuing operations increased by Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 416m, although
changes in exchange rates inflated the overall sales figure by more than
Pounds 50m.
Profit from continuing operations, excluding divestments, was Pounds 9.7m,
compared with Pounds 12.5m in 1992. Currency effects added Pounds 1.5m to
the profits figure.
The group said its order book at the end of June was 4 per cent lower than
at the same stage last year, but the value of orders received in July and
August was much higher.
Mr Clive Strowger, chief executive, has closed five production plants and
sold six businesses since he was appointed in June last year. The group's
workforce fell by 400 to just under 11,000 in the six months to June. Two
years ago it stood at 14,000.
Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said customers in the UK and US would only
invest in capital equipment when they were confident that there was a
sustained economic recovery.
He added: 'The group's businesses in the Asia Pacific region continue to
enjoy favourable economic and market conditions. However, it may be some
time before there is an improvement in the economic climate in continental
Europe, which is the source of nearly 40 per cent of the the group's orders
and sales.'
The group said reduced trading profits and significant restructuring costs
would depress UK taxable profits this year, resulting in a substantial
Advance Corporation Tax write-off, giving an effective tax rate of 51 per
cent. Earnings per share fell from 2.8p to 0.7p, but the interim dividend
was held at 2p.

THE STEPS taken last year to restructure management and control costs have
put British Fittings Group back in the black in the six months to June 30.

Mr Michael Borlenghi, chairman, said working capital had remained under
strict control and net borrowings had fallen by a further Pounds 977,000 to
Pounds 18.29m, making a reduction of over Pounds 5m since June 1992.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Legal &amp; General rises to Pounds 75m -
Strong recovery on general insurance side bolsters midterm profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG recovery in the performance of its general insurance business
helped Legal &amp; General, the composite insurer, to increase pre-tax profits
from Pounds 72.5m to Pounds 75m for the first six months of 1993.
The underlying increase was stronger since last year's profits were
bolstered by Pounds 31.5m from the sale of the UK investment management
businesses to the L&amp;G Society Life Fund.
Earnings per share rose to 6.5p (6.2p) and the interim dividend is being
lifted from 6.2p to 6.5p, an increase of 4.8 per cent.
Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, said the results 'demonstrated the
strong management actions taken to improve performance.'
Profits from worldwide life and pensions business increased from Pounds
75.4m to Pounds 77.7m. In the UK, total life and pensions profits grew by 8
per cent to Pounds 59.7m reflecting underlying growth in the portfolio and
an increase in the number of maturing policies.
Total premium income for the half year rose from Pounds 692.1m to Pounds
950m, with new business up by 27 per cent to Pounds 122.7m. Annual premiums
of Pounds 74.1m compared with Pounds 73m and new single premiums doubled
from Pounds 235.1m to Pounds 486.1m.
Overall growth in new premiums reflected the gradual emergence of the
economy from recession, said Mr Prosser. L&amp;G had also benefited from tighter
control of distribution channels.
A small profit of Pounds 200,000 was recorded on general insurance business.
The most important factor here was an improvement in the mortgage indemnity
account following the establishment of significant reserves in recent years.
The account broke even in the first half compared with a loss of Pounds
26.4m last year.
Profits from property insurance amounted to Pounds 8.8m, mainly as a result
of rate increases and a fall in weather-related claims.
Total worldwide funds under management reached Pounds 28bn at the end of
June, a rise of Pounds 3.3bn since the beginning of 1992.
COMMENT
Legal &amp; General appears to have put some of its recent troubles behind it
with the effects of management changes bearing fruit. Yesterday's profit
figures have followed news of a pick-up in new business growth. The 4.8 per
cent interim dividend increase indicates a full year dividend of about 20p,
leaving a prospective yield of more than 5 per cent, well above the sector
average. Strong asset backing will also provide underpinning, while reduced
exposure on the domestic indemnity front should lead to less volatility in
the share's performance. However, L&amp;G has significantly outperformed the
market since last autumn, indicating that investors have discounted some of
the recovery already. The picture is also clouded because of concern about
the future of the endowment market - in which L&amp;G is a big player - after
the government's decision this year to impose new disclosure rules on
commissions. All this will limit the stock's potential.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Photo-Me rises 7% but shares tumble 50p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth
manufacturer and operator, fell sharply yesterday as the group reported
pre-tax profits for the year just 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 17.59m, against
Pounds 16.41m.
While sterling's devaluation contributed Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits, the
gains were absorbed by high depreciation costs, which reached Pounds 14.3m
(Pounds 11m). The shares closed down 50p at 343p.
Operating profits before depreciation rose to Pounds 31.78m (Pounds 27.42m),
while turnover grew to Pounds 134m (Pounds 114.8m).
Mr David Miller, managing director, said that the rise in depreciation costs
reflected the cost of installing instant printing machines for letterheads
and labels, as well as upgrading 600 photo-booths with equipment that
provided prints in three minutes instead of five.
The group had also written down to zero assets on an older business in
Europe, taking a one-off charge of Pounds 1m, and incurred start-up losses
in Eastern and Central Europe.
Mr Miller said the company was disappointed by the lack of growth in its key
markets, but it had 'taken our bad news on the chin.'
The group would continue to concentrate on its core photographic and imaging
businesses, including 'Fun' studios, which allow customers to be
photographed in front of famous backdrops or with celebrities. It had signed
agreements to sell 'significant quantities' of equipment to new territories.
The group continues to expect potential growth from its data identification
systems division, which provides photos for identity cards. It blamed
'governmental financing' for slow growth in the past two years.
Earnings per share eased to 17.58p (17.9p). A final dividend of 3.2p is
proposed, giving a total for the year of 4.6p (4.4p).

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: New centre helps Bentalls cut interim
deficit to Pounds 419,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BENTALLS, the department store operator, reported a reduced interim pre-tax
loss yesterday helped by an exceptional gain and the first rental income
from the recently completed Bentall Centre in Kingston.
The group, which operates seven department stores in the south-east of
England, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 419,000 (Pounds 1.05m) in the six
months to July 31. But despite posting losses per share of 0.67p (0.29p),
the group is maintaining the 0.6p interim dividend. Turnover grew by 11 per
cent to Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 30.5m) led by the flagship Kingston store,
which accounts for 60 per cent of the total, and by sales of household
items.
Operating profits of Pounds 480,000 (Pounds 971,000 loss), were bolstered by
the Pounds 825,000 minimum guaranteed rental income from the Bentall Centre
which opened in November and by Pounds 345,000 in receipts from reductions
in the uniform business rate on two of the smaller stores and the head
office building.
These gains helped offset interest charges which increased to Pounds
899,000, against Pounds 75,000 last time when the group benefited from
Pounds 1.27m of capitalised interest.
Mr Edward Bentall, chairman, said the results included reduced losses at the
group's store at the Thurrock Lakeside shopping centre which was acquired
two years ago.
In the second half, the group is also expected to benefit from the increased
customer traffic generated by the Bentall Centre, particularly during the
important Christmas period.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: US helps Wassall rise 56% to Pounds 9.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASSALL, the conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits up by 56 per cent to Pounds 9.74m in the first
half of 1993, on increased sales of Pounds 133.1m (Pounds 117m).
The results were helped by a strong performance from DAP, a US supplier of
DIY products, and Metals Closures, manufacturing plastic bottle tops in the
UK and South Africa.
Mr Christopher Miller, chief executive, said: 'In the UK, the ingredients
for a sustained economic improvement are already in place although full
recovery may have to wait for further fall in continental interest rates.'
Net cash at the end of the half year was Pounds 28m, down Pounds 3m on the
previous year end reflecting the increased funding requirements in the last
six months.
Mr Miller said: 'We would increase earnings just by spending our cash, but
obviously we want to use it on an acquisition which will enhance the
company. We are confident we will catch our fish.'
Last year the group was thwarted in its attempt to acquire Evode, the
chemicals and plastics company, by Laporte, the speciality chemicals
company.
Increasing demand for plastic bottle tops was behind closures's 30 per cent
profit increase to Pounds 5m.
Although volumes from Antler, the suitcase business, were unchanged, prices
suffered leading to a fall in profits to Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 638,000).
Earnings per share rose to 4.2p (3.3p). The interim dividend is increased to
1p (0.76p).
COMMENT:
Yesterday marked the fifth anniversary of Wassall. With hindsight 1988 could
not have been a worse time to start a conglomerate: the UK economic boom was
on the verge of imploding and industrial holding companies were about to go
out of fashion. To increase operating profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 9.5m
demonstrates a resilence in the face of difficult markets. The group's size
gives it an advantage over other conglomerates struggling to pull off a big
deal. Its Pounds 380m market capitalisation - from Pounds 1.9m five years
ago - is relatively small. That makes it easier to make another acquisition
two years after it bought DAP in the US and three years after it acquired
metal closures in the UK. With forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
27m, the shares - up 8p to 252p - are on a justified prospective multiple of
22.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Laporte jumps as Evode result springs
surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Laporte jumped 6 per cent yesterday after the speciality chemicals
group surprised the City with the speed of its transformation of Evode, the
chemicals and plastic group it bought in January.
Laporte had been accused by some analysts of overpaying when it came in as a
white knight to bid for Evode, which was under siege from Wassall, the
mini-conglomerate. Laporte's agreed offer was Pounds 129m, Pounds 16m more
than Wassall's hostile bid.
Evode made operating profits of Pounds 13.1m in the five months to July 5,
on sales of Pounds 117m, compared with Pounds 14m in the previous year under
its former management.
Mr Ken Minton, Laporte's chief executive, said: 'The integration of the
Evode businesses has been achieved and has enhanced earnings in the first
half, as promised at the time of the acquisition.'
Laporte has moved quickly to trim costs, cutting 189 jobs from Evode's
workforce of 2,305, including a swathe of management.
The head office has been closed, as has a loss-making German subsidiary.
Mr Minton said Evode's profit margins had been lifted from 3.9 per cent to
double figures, and were on course to match the group average of 14 percent.
The Evode acquisition helped Laporte to increase pre-tax profits by 15 per
cent to Pounds 51m on sales which were 37 per cent ahead at Pounds 440m.
Group debt at the half-year was Pounds 170m. This compared with Pounds 190m
immediately after the acquisition of Evode.
The group said this reflected tight control being exercised on all working
capital and capital expenditure.
Negotiations on the sale of parts of Evode identified as non-core were well
advanced.
Group capital expenditure had been sharply reduced from Pounds 29m to Pounds
25.5m.
This included Pounds 2.1m for the Evode companies.
Mr Minton said capital expenditure was now on a downward trend from last
year's total of Pounds 74m and would not exceed Pounds 53m in the full year.
Mr Minton said: 'With the US markets looking more attractive, offset by
subdued European markets, the group expects to sustain progress in the
second half.'
Earnings per share rose by 7 per cent to 20.1p (18.8p). The interim dividend
was lifted by 5.7 per cent to 7.4p (7p).
COMMENT
The sharp increase in the share price reflected what one analyst described
as a 'stupendous' performance from Evode.
There was thus a justifiable smile on the face of Mr Ken Minton, the chief
executive, who had been widely suspected of overpaying for his latest
acquisition. Analysts have upgraded their full-year forecasts to about
Pounds 110m, which puts the shares on a prospective multiple of 15.5. A
group so well placed to benefit from recovery in the UK and US might expect
to be on better than a market average rating at this stage in the cycle, but
there remains suspicion in the City towards the company. which has a large
number of businesses and has caused its share of disappointment in the past.
The performance of its other businesses was also subdued, after stripping
out acquisitions and currency effects. A period of consolidation has been
promised while recent acquisitions are absorbed. Such a pause, combined with
solid trading as demand improves, could see the shares rise in the medium
term.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: RJB set to bid for large part of British
Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the recently-floated mining group, said yesterday it expected to
bid for a large section of British Coal in the forthcoming privatisation, as
it declared interim profits up 25 per cent to Pounds 5.55m which were at the
top end of expectations.
Mr Richard Budge, chairman, said he was delighted by government indications
that it planned to break up the corporation into five parts. He expected to
be a bidder for at least one of the main sections.
RJB has already submitted tenders to mine under licence five pits which are
no longer wanted by British Coal, although one - for Easington in the
north-east of England - has been withdrawn. It plans to bid for up to seven
more if British Coal starts to effect closures among 12 pits reprieved by
the government in March.
The City approved of RJB's performance for the half year to June 30, lifting
the shares by 10p to 269p. RJB's profits, which compared with Pounds 4.45m
last time, were achieved on turnover of Pounds 37.74m (Pounds 37.3m).
The result enabled RJB to declare an interim dividend of 5p, covered 1.83
times.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Commercial realities nibble into UB's
global ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO-and-a-half years after a cadre of youthful managers took command at
United Biscuits with bold plans to build an international biscuits and
snacks empire, harsh commercial realities are starting to define the limits
of their global ambitions.
Since 1990 a string of acquisitions in continental Europe and Australasia
have substantially widened the geographic spread of the previously
UK-centred group and lifted overseas sales to more than half its total
turnover.
However, while these additions have so far performed well, contributing more
than a third of first-half group operating profit, UB faces an even tougher
struggle than it bargained for in solving the problems at Keebler, its
troubled US subsidiary.
Indeed, Keebler's stuttering recovery from the ravages of last year's
'cookie wars' - despite much top management attention - appears to be trying
UB's patience and raising questions about the strength of its long-term
commitment to the US market, which provides a third of group sales. At the
same time, the position of the group's British biscuits and snacks
businesses - on which it has relied to fund much of its foreign expansion -
is starting to look less impregnable.
Squeezed by keen price competition and a sharp rise in raw material costs,
McVitie's UK operating profits fell nine per cent in the first half, while
the KP snacks division achieved only a two per cent increase.
While some of the pain reflects the short-term impact of recession and
sterling's devaluation, UB is reconciled to a possibly permanent reduction
in its historically high UK margins in order to maintain its dominant market
share.
Across the Atlantic, UB is pursuing the reverse strategy. After insisting a
year ago that Keebler's immediate priority was to re-build its battered
market share, the group now says it aims to slim the US company's business
back to a profitable base.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Whatman lifts profits 8% to Pounds 4.6m
midway

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATMAN, the specialist paper, filtration equipment and gas generator
manufacturer, lifted pre-tax profits 8 per cent from Pounds 4.22m to Pounds
4.56m in the first half of 1993.
There was an underlying growth in sales of 6 per cent, but once a Pounds
1.2m contribution from acquisitions and exchange rate factors are added in,
turnover advanced 30 per cent from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 33.7m.
The exchange rate in the half was Pounds 1/Dollars 1.51, against Pounds
1/Dollars 1.91 last time. Mr Hugh Perrott, finance director, said that
currency movements had little impact on profits, as the forward contracts
covering the foreign exchange exposure were taken out before sterling's
devaluation.
In sales terms, the UK, where they slipped after a strong performance in the
corresponding period, accounted for less than 15 per cent; North America
spoke for some 60 per cent; continental Europe 15 per cent; and Japan 5 per
cent.
Net borrowings grew by almost Pounds 4m to Pounds 5.5m over the half, though
acquisitions accounted for Pounds 2.5m of that.
The interim dividend is raised 6.5 per cent to 3.3p (3.1p), payable from
earnings up at 12.91p (12.26p) per share.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: New chief executive for Hartstone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARTSTONE, the troubled hosiery and leather group which is in refinancing
talks with its bankers, yesterday announced that it had found a new chief
executive to replace Mr Stephen Barker, the founder of the company who left
following a series of profits warnings earlier this year.
Mr John Hunter, aged 56, former chairman of SmithKline Beecham Consumer
Brands, will take over as chief executive from November. He is also a
director of Wace Group, Blue Circle Industries and David Lloyd Leisure.
Mr Hunter, who retired from SKB nine months ago, said he had accepted
'because I like a challenge . . . and there are opportunities as well as
challenges in this business.'
Mr Shaun Dowling, who has been conducting the refinancing talks and running
the group as executive chairman since May, said the appointment marked a
'red letter day for Hartstone'.
He and Mr Hunter would be jointly involved in the refinancing talks, which
must be completed by January when a standstill agreement expires.
Hartstone is believed to be considering a further appointment to the board,
possibly a US director.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: RMC little changed at Pounds 61.6m - Rise
for UK as prices hold firm and expansion in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RMC GROUP, the concrete producer, reported a slight decline in first-half
pre-tax profits from Pounds 62.1m to Pounds 61.6m despite higher operating
profits in both the UK, where ready mixed concrete prices firmed, and
Germany.
Turnover from continuing operations in the six months to June 30 increased
by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.56bn (Pounds 1.4bn) including Pounds 71.7m from
acquisitions in Germany. Operating profits were Pounds 81.3m (Pounds 78.7m)
including Pounds 5.8m from the acquisitions.
Over the past 2 1/2 years the group has invested between Pounds 270m and
Pounds 280m in its cement operations in eastern Germany. This is reflected
in an increase in net interest paid to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 18.5m).
The merger of the east and west German operations in April enabled RMC to
take advantage of substantial tax reliefs and incentives available in
eastern Germany.
Overseas tax fell to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 24.2m). The overall charge dropped
to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 26m), a rate of 26 per cent which was expected to be
maintained for at least five years.
Earnings per share, after allowing for higher minorities, increased to 13.4p
(12.1p) with about 1p of the gain reflecting currency movements. The interim
dividend is maintained at 6.6p per share.
In the UK delivered volumes of ready mixed concrete and aggregates fell
further with sand and gravel volumes down by 2 or 3 per cent.
However operating profits increased to Pounds 14m (Pounds 8.8m) on turnover
of Pounds 452.1m (Pounds 440.9m) reflecting the cost reductions achieved
over the last year and improved results from those activities associated
with the housing sector.
In addition RMC said small increases of up to 3 per cent in the price of
ready mixed concrete in the first half had held.
Overseas, Mr Peter Young, group managing director, said construction
activity in Germany continued at a high level because of strong demand for
housing in the west and an expansion of building work in the east.
Overall operating profits of the expanded German operations increased to
Pounds 50.4m (Pounds 40.5m) on turnover of Pounds 654.6m (Pounds 503.7m).
However elsewhere in the EC, with the exception of the Netherlands, there
was an overall decline in profitability to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 23.6m) on
turnover which declined to Pounds 305.5m (Pounds 334.2m). The decline was
most marked in France and Spain where volumes fell by 11 per cent and 19 per
cent respectively.
Activities in the south-eastern US states showed a significant improvement
but an associated undertaking in northern California continued to experience
difficult trading conditions.
Exceptionally competitive markets reduced profits in Austria and the group's
Israeli concrete subsidiary was affected by labour problems. But the Israeli
roadstone operations, which are an associated undertaking, boosted profits.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Oriel losses at Pounds 28,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ORIEL GROUP, the USM-quoted insurance broker, reported pre-tax losses of
Pounds 28,000 in the half year to the end of June, against profits of Pounds
1.2m.
The result was in line with expectations set out in the chairman's statement
with the 1992 report and accounts. A loss of Pounds 1.28m in the second half
left annual pre-tax losses at Pounds 74,000.
Income for the first half of 1993 was Pounds 4.65m, including Pounds 364,000
from acquisitions, against Pounds 6.66m. Towards the end of the period the
company bought Warranty Holdings and figures for three weeks are included.
Losses per share came out at 1.15p (earnings 5.27p) but the interim dividend
is maintained at 2p. Mr Nigel Cayzer, chairman, said the move reflected the
underlying profitability.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Davis Service ahead at Pounds 8.47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Davis Service Group, the now reorganised and refocused
business services concern, rose from Pounds 8.03m to Pounds 8.47m in the six
months to June 30.
The results for the first half of 1992 were skewed by a Pounds 2.45m
contribution from Godfrey Davis (Contract Hire), sold in April 1992 for
Pounds 5.75m, and a net interest charge of Pounds 2.53m, which was mostly
the result of the large amount of 'back-to-back' borrowings incurred by the
contract hire business. Net interest payable this time came to Pounds
456,000.
Gearing at the period-end was 23 per cent on borrowings of Pounds 25.5m,
Pounds 18m of which were built up by the Pounds 52m acquisition in May of
HSS Hire Services Group from John Mowlem.
The 170-strong HSS chain contributed Pounds 699,000 to continuing operating
profits of Pounds 8.93m (Pounds 8.11m) and Pounds 10.2m to continuing
turnover of Pounds 119m (Pounds 101.7m). It is expected to grow at the rate
of 20 outlets a year. Total group turnover came to Pounds 127.7m (Pounds
124.7m).
Mr George Boyle, finance director, said as had been foreseen, demand in the
group's markets had remained flat, making for increased competition and
pressure on margins.
Earnings per share advanced to 6.51p (6.39p) and the interim dividend is
held at 2.73p.

FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Commercial realities nibble into UB's
global ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO-and-a-half years after a cadre of youthful managers took command at
United Biscuits with bold plans to build an international biscuits and
snacks empire, harsh commercial realities are starting to define the limits
of their global ambitions.
Since 1990 a string of acquisitions in continental Europe and Australasia
have substantially widened the geographic spread of the previously
UK-centred group and lifted overseas sales to more than half its total
turnover.
However, while these additions have so far performed well,contributing more
than a third of first-half group operating profit, UB faces an even tougher
struggle than it bargained for in solving the problems at Keebler, its
troubled US subsidiary.
Indeed, Keebler's stuttering recovering from the ravages of last year's
'cookie wars' - despite much top management attention - appears to be trying
UB's patience and raising questions about the strength of its long-term
commitment to the US market, which provides a third of group sales. At the
same time, the position of the group's British biscuits and snacks
businesses - on which it has relied to fund much of its foreign expansion -
is starting to look less impregnable.
Squeezed by keen price competition and a sharp rise in raw material costs,
McVitie's UK operating profits fell nine per cent in the first half, while
the KP snacks division achieved only a two per cent increase.
While some of the pain reflects the short-term impact of recession and
sterling's devaluation, UB is reconciled to a possibly permanent reduction
in its historically high UK margins in order to maintain its dominant market
share.
Across the Atlantic, UB is pursuing the reverse strategy. After insisting a
year ago that Keebler's immediate priority was to re-build its battered
market share, the group now says it aims to slim the US company's business
back to a profitable base.
The shift of objective recognises what UB concedes is Keebler's
disappointingly slow progress to date. Its sales of branded cookies and
crackers fell sharply in the first half, and margins are still far lower
than before the cookie war. Though operating profit rose 22 per cent, most
of the increase came from Bake-Line, the own-label biscuit maker acquired
earlier this year.
But even if Keebler's margins can be re-built, its long-term future looks
uncertain.
Sir Robert Clarke, UB's chairman, did not discourage suggestions yesterday
that Keebler might be classified along with Ross Young's, the UK frozen food
division, as a business which was not central to group strategy and might be
sold if the right bid came along.
There is no suggestion yet that bids are being sought for Keebler. However,
UB does not disguise the fact that it is now focusing most of its
international expansion effort on Asia and continental Europe, where it has
yet to acquire a substantial presence in any of the larger countries.

FT  17 SEP 93 / United Biscuits held to 1% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIERCE price competition and a cost squeeze in the UK held United Biscuits,
Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer, to a 1 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits, before exceptionals, to Pounds 70.8m in the six months
to July 17.
The result, against Pounds 70m last year, was achieved in spite of buoyant
performances in continental Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, and a modest
recovery by Keebler, its troubled US subsidiary. The final pre-tax figure
was boosted to Pounds 133.5m by an exceptional Pounds 62.7m gain from the
sale of Terrys, the chocolate manufacturer, to Philip Morris, the US food
and tobacco group, this year.
Sir Robert Clarke, chairman, said trading remained intensively competitive
and second-half UK profits were unlikely to show any year-on-year
improvement. However, he expected a 'satisfactory' increase in group profit
for the year.
The biggest setback in the UK was at McVitie's, the biscuits division, where
operating profit fell 9 per cent to Pounds 36.6m from Pounds 40m, reducing
margins to 11.8 per cent from 14 per cent.
Mr Eric Nicoli, chief executive, said half the fall in margin was due to the
failure to recover higher raw materials costs and half to increased
marketing expenses designed to check an erosion of market share.
The market share loss, which had been in McVitie's own-label business, had
been reversed in the second quarter. However, UB expected lower margins to
persist for the foreseeable future.
UK operating profit at KP, the snacks division, rose 2 per cent to Pounds
14.1m while Ross Young's, the frozen foods business, lifted profit by 6 per
cent to Pounds 15.1 and increased its share of the British market. Total UK
operating profit fell 3 per cent to Pounds 59.9m.
Recent acquisitions boosted operating profit in continental Europe by 36 per
cent to Pounds 13.7m, while Smith's, the Australian snacks division
purchased last year contributed a Pounds 4.7m profit.
In the US, Keebler's operating profit rose 22 per cent to Pounds 16m. But
most of the recovery was due to Bake-Line, the newly-acquired US own-label
producer, and Keebler's sales of branded products fell.
An increase in turnover of 20 per cent to Pounds 1.84bn from Pounds 1.53bn
was mostly came from international operations, which contributed 55 per cent
of sales and 36 per cent of operating profit.
Earnings per share rose to 17p from 9.7p, but fell to 9.5p after adjustment
to reflect the exceptional gain from the Terrys' sale. The interim dividend
is unchanged at 5.5p

FT  17 SEP 93 / NBC nears Super Channel purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NBC, the US television network, is close to clinching the purchase of Super
Channel, the pan-European satellite television channel which claims it is
available in around 50m homes.
The deal is expected to value Super Channel, 64 per cent owned by the
Marcucci family of Italy and 36 per cent per cent by Mr Richard Branson's
Virgin group, at around Dollars 70m.
It is a further sign of the growing competition in the European satellite
television market. BSkyB, parent company of Sky Television, recently
launched a series of new channels, as part of its drive to increase
revenues.
Super Channel is broadcast via the Eutelsat satellite, the rival to Astra,
which carries Sky Television's channels.
NBC, which is owned by the US conglomerate, General Electric, already
broadcasts programmes on Super Channel through its cable channel, CNBC.
Super Channel, which says that the number of its viewers has increased from
8m to 150m over the past five years, resisted a takeover attempt from United
Artists Entertainment, the US cable television and cinema company, in 1990.
But it recently decided that it should be part of a media conglomerate. The
deal with NBC will enable it to pay off its debts, believed to be more than
Pounds 15m.
According to a financier close to General Electric, NBC has been in talks
with Super Channel for some months and hopes to announce completion of the
deal within 10 days.
The Marcucci family, which runs a family business with annual turnover of
Pounds 250m, is expected to use the proceeds from the deal to boost its
other telecommunication interests.
It has television interests in Greece and Italy and has long harboured
ambitions to set up a pan European television production company producing
quality programmes.
Three years ago it bought a series of European satellite and cable
television rights for Super Channel from MGM/UA, the Hollywood studio that
was bought by Mr Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications and is now
controlled by the French bank, Credit Lyonnais.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Italy's shares boom built on shaky foundations: Financial
instability threatens to turn companies' success into disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian shares have climbed so sharply this summer that the stock exchange's
overburdened computers recently suffered a three-hour breakdown under the
weight of buy orders.
Milan has been the fastest-rising bourse in Europe since January. Investors
have piled into equities as rates on government bonds have fallen in line
with the international trend towards lower borrowing. That has prompted a
bout of share buying unequalled since the mid-1980s when enthusiasm about
company profits made Italy Europe's best-performing stock market.
However, this time the corporate sector is in much worse shape: companies
have borrowed more heavily, interest rates remain relatively high, and
Italy's 18-month political corruption scandal has tarnished the reputation
of many companies.
Unless there is reform in management, banking and regulation of many
companies, the surge in share prices could be a bubble waiting to burst.
Italy's banks have been taking the brunt of criticism. 'The banks lent too
freely in the late 1980s, when deposits were growing fast and bankers were
falling over themselves to lend to companies to win market share,' one
foreign banker says. The legacy of that decision is immense debts that some
groups are finding impossible to repay.
At least six of Italy's best-known companies have had to turn to their
bankers for help this year. Ciga, the luxury hotels group controlled by the
Aga Khan, has stopped paying interest on over L1,000bn (Pounds 414.42m) of
debts and is trying to sell some of its best-known hotels to cut its
financial burdens. The Cameli family, which runs a shipping and commodities
trading concern, and Arvedi, one of Italy's biggest steelmakers, are both
trying to shed assets to meet debts of more than L1,000bn.
The need for corporate rescues has pinpointed serious flaws in the way banks
lend money and the way in which groups use it.
Banks have stumbled in extending credit too freely, without assessing the
risks. Many credits have been tied to fixed assets rather than to
cash-generating operations.
Weaknesses have also emerged in the way banks monitor their lending. This
year's financial crisis at Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest private company,
has exposed some glaring lapses. Many banks were unaware of the extent of
their loans to the sprawling Ferruzzi empire. 'Credit controls are still not
up to the best international standards and management information systems
are often antiquated,' says the international credit chief of one US bank.
Poor management information and an emphasis on growth at all costs have been
evident at many of the companies now in difficulty. Opportunistic
diversifications were also common.
The Camelis expanded into an array of unrelated activities, including cash
registers. And Ferruzzi, which is now staggering under debts of more than
L28,000bn, expanded aggressively during the later 1980s, through a stream of
takeovers and investments that moved it away from its core agricultural
business.
Part of the reason for the costly diversifications was to enhance the image
of the controlling Ferruzzi family. Determination to match industrial
dynasties such as the Agnellis, who control the Fiat cars group, was a big
influence on Mr Raul Gardini, Ferruzzi's former chairman, who killed himself
in July.
Such lese-majeste with shareholders' money has been facilitated by family
domination of many companies. The Agnellis still own about 30 per cent of
Fiat, while policy at Ferruzzi, which is 48 per cent controlled by the
founding family, was dictated first by Mr Gardini and then by Mr Carlo Sama,
both sons-in-law of the founder.
While owner-managers can contribute greater commitment to a business and
understanding of its operations than an outsider, they can also be
liabilities. Some Italian owner managers find it difficult to distance
themselves from their companies and deal with difficult decisions.
In the case of Ferruzzi, owner-management may even have contributed to
fraud. Ferruzzi's new management, imposed by creditor banks in June,
believes executives and members of the Ferruzzi family covered up L435bn in
trading losses since 1989.
Even when outside executives are brought into a company, their freedom of
action is often limited by the management structures and the need to defer
to controlling family interests.
The complex legal structure of many family-controlled companies has also
restricted outside influences. Many well-known companies, such as Fiat,
Pirelli, Ferruzzi and Benetton, are modelled on a pyramid, with a wholly
owned holding company at the pinnacle, exercising control through separate
holdings.
For Italy's private sector companies to gain a sounder financial footing,
such weaknesses need to be addressed.
Ferruzzi, which is due to unveil a restructuring plan later this month,
could provide the first opportunity to such changes into practice. The
group's new management has already appointed a slimmed-down board that
should be more accountable to shareholders. Members of the Ferruzzi family
have been excluded and one director has been appointed to represent the
group's 49,000 small shareholders.
The re-organisation is expected to involve a substantial simplification of
the group's complex structure, and a return to the food and agricultural
businesses on which the group was based.
If the changes are sufficiently ambitious, Ferruzzi could become the first
of a new generation of Italian companies with a wide shareholder base,
transparent structure and clear, commercial aims. If the plan fails, the
weaknesses in Italy's corporate sector could worsen.

FT  17 SEP 93 / LIG falls after new profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSTS yesterday slashed annual profits forecasts for London International
Group from about Pounds 35m to Pounds 18m as the world's leading branded
condom manufacturer issued its second profits warning in seven months and
announced the early retirement of chief executive, Mr Tony Butterworth.
Earlier this year analysts had been expecting annual profits of about Pounds
40m. The shares tumbled 63p on last night's news to close at 140p.
LIG, which was censured by the stock exchange in May for issuing an informal
profits warning to a select group of 13 brokers and four institutions, said
yesterday difficulties in its photoprocessing business would leave interim
profits 'very substantially lower' than last year.
Mr Alan Woltz, chairman, said the group had been disappointed by another
poor season in the photo division, leaving it with a small loss in the
half-year to September 30. The health and personal products division had
been hit by recession and restructuring, Mr Woltz said, although it would
enjoy a stronger second half. Gearing remained high, around 100 per cent.
Analysts were taken aback by the extent of the warning and some were
dismayed to see Mr Butterworth depart. 'It was a surprise,' said Ms
Jacqueline Cantle of Smith New Court. 'We did not expect trading to be that
good but the extent of the shortfall is greater than we had expected.' SNC
estimated photoprocessing had incurred losses of Pounds 2m, in spite of cost
savings of Pounds 6m-Pounds 7m in the past 12 months.
Some speculated that the announcement of LIG's strategic review would result
in the disposal or closure of the photo business. 'Either they will sort
that out,' said Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett, 'or someone else will
do it for them.'
LIG was careful to take a cautious approach in its annual general meeting
statement. Analysts, who found it difficult to pitch forecasts following
discussions with a reticent LIG, said the group was nervous of incurring
further censure from the stock exchange. 'They seem terrified to do anything
unless they are talking to 50 people all at one time,' one said.
The group announced that Mr Butterworth, 56, would be replaced by managing
director Mr Nick Hodges, 54.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Dixons shares leap on plans to sell US chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, leapt 27p to 260p
yesterday as the company announced it was selling its loss-making US chain
Silo to Fretter, another US electrical retailer.
The City welcomed the move as the ideal solution for Dixons to the growing
problems at Silo, which lost Pounds 22.4m in the year to May 1 and cost it
Pounds 36.2m in closure costs. One analyst called it a 'tremendous deal.
Pretty faultless'.
The sale will result in a charge of Pounds 19.8m against Dixons' half-year
profits to cover current-year US trading losses and an exceptional loss on
disposal. A second charge of Pounds 191.1m, relating to goodwill previously
written off to reserves, is a procedure required by new accounting standards
and has no impact on shareholders' funds.
The 185-store Silo chain is being sold to Fretter in return for a 30 per
cent stake in the enlarged Fretter group, Dollars 30m of 5 per cent
convertible preferred stock, and Dollars 15m of 6 per cent preferred stock.
Fretter will change its name to YES] Your Electronics Superstore, given to
three revamped Silo stores in Rochester, New York.
The investment will be accounted for by Dixons as a related company.
The 5 per cent preferred stock could be converted at any time into ordinary
shares, giving Dixons a potential stake of 49 per cent. Dixons said it did
not intend to convert the stock in the short term.
Mr Robert Shrager, finance director, said trading at Silo had continued to
improve in recent months, but it would take some years and further
investment before Silo achieved adequate profits.
Combining Fretter and Silo would create a group better able to compete in
the US market, he added. There was also considerable potential for improving
profits through cutting costs, by streamlining the distribution network and
corporate offices, and closing poorly performing stores.
Dixons future exposure to Silo is limited to the Dollars 50m carrying value
of its investment in Fretter, together with a secured standby credit
facility of Dollars 40m available for 13 months after completion.
Fretter is a Michigan-based electrical retailer operating 101 stores in
three different formats. For the year to January 31, it reported pre-tax
profits of Dollars 8.7m on sales of Dollars 361.1m.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Yeltsin reappoints Gaidar in boost for reform moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YEGOR GAIDAR, the architect of Russia's economic reform, who resigned
under pressure from parliament at the end of last year, is to rejoin the
cabinet as a first deputy prime minister as the government acts to impose a
tough package of spending cuts and tax rises.
President Boris Yeltsin announced the appointment, a strong boost to
faltering economic reform and an equally big snub to parliament, as he
visited troops near Moscow.
Mr Yeltsin was quoted by the official news agency Tass as saying that 'in
this way the conflict between the deputy ministers Oleg Lobov and Boris
Fyodorov will be decided'.
Mr Lobov, who has been pressing a programme of state investment and controls
on the president, in opposition to Mr Fyodorov's advocacy of strict
macroeconomic controls and cuts in state expenditure, appears to be the main
loser - and with him, the alternative economic strategy based on state
credits and an end to voucher privatisation.
The decision to invite back Mr Gaidar, issued to the 37-year-old economist
by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, was taken around the time of
a visit to Moscow earlier this week by Mr Laurence Summers, the US Treasury
undersecretary.
Mr Summers, who has been deeply concerned over the Russian reform progress,
to which the Group of Seven governments had pledged a package of support
worth Dollars 44bn, was said to be heartened by his visit. He hoped that the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank lending programmes, suspended
because of lack of progress on reform, would be resumed before the year end
.
The decision to bring back Mr Gaidar, whether or not taken under direct
US/G7 pressure, is clearly meant as a signal that Russia remains committed
to reform - and that Mr Yeltsin is willing to confront parliament in his
struggle to replace the constitution as well as the economic system.
Those close to Mr Gaidar say that he has already demanded that Mr Lobov, a
former Communist party official with close links to Mr Yeltsin, should be
fired.
At the same time, senior officials in the finance ministry, Mr Fyodorov's
base, cautioned last night that Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov, although both
radicals, could clash over policy implementation.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Jobless rise increases government discomfort: Figures prompt
unease among investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT rose again last month, according to official figures released
yesterday, triggering nervousness on the foreign exchange markets and
unsettling the government further after a week of poor economic statistics.
The jobless total increased a seasonally adjusted 5,800 in August following
a sharply revised increase of 4,300 in July. The number of people out of
work and claiming benefit now stands at 2.92m, or 10.4 per cent of the
workforce.
The August monthly increase was the second in a row and went some way
towards reversing falls in unemployment that occurred between February and
May. However, the jobless total is still lower than it was in April.
The news contributed to unease among investors, already unsettled by an
attack on the prime minister's leadership by Mr Norman Lamont, the former
chancellor. The pound dropped a pfennig to close at DM2.4625.
Yesterday's figures from the department of employment contained other
worrying signals. Average earnings growth remained lodged at 3.5 per cent in
the year to July suggesting that pay settlements have hit bottom ahead of
the rate of inflation.
After the surprise jump in headline inflation earlier this week, the news on
earnings may undermine confidence that inflationary pressures are dead.
There was also a sharp downwards revision to the latest productivity figures
after the rebasing and reweighting of manufacturing output figures. In the
three months to July, output per head grew by 6.7 per cent compared with the
previous three month period. The figure for June was revised down from 8.2
per cent to 7.2 per cent.
Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, drew attention to a 20,000 rise in
employment in the three months ending June, the first quarterly rise in
employment for three years. 'A small rise in unemployment of 5,800 is not
unexpected at this stage of the recovery when individual monthly figures
will vary.'
The Treasury said the latest figures indicated a slow labour market recovery
even though they showed small rises in unemployment in the last two months.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called for a
1 per cent cut in interest rates and a 'substantial package for growth' in
the November budget.
'These figures show unemployment is still the biggest problem facing the
country. The feeble recovery is now in danger of stalling.' he said.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Tokyo unveils Pounds 37bn spending package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new government yesterday announced Y6,150bn (Pounds 37.3bn) in
government spending, deregulation and measures to pass on the rewards of the
yen's strength to consumers.
The measures, the government's first big economic initiative, are designed
to help pull the country back from the edge of recession. To widespread
disappointment it fell short of proposing income tax cuts.
Business groups have urged tax reductions, but the seven-party coalition is
divided on fiscal policy and the finance ministry is unwilling to lose
revenue.
The package brings to Y18,350bn the amount set aside so far this year to
stimulate the flagging economy, after a Y13,200bn plan by the previous
government in April. Most of that has yet to be spent.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, admitted that yesterday's measures
were insufficient to revive the economy, but did not exclude further action.
The yen rose against the dollar, while Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. The
Nikkei average closed 445.64 points lower at 20,502.15.
The plans received a lukewarm reception from economic analysts, but a
cordial response from the US, which has been urging Japan to stimulate the
economy to restrict its record trade surplus.
Mr Laurence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary, who is visiting Tokyo,
said he was pleased to see Mr Hosokawa introduce such measures so soon after
taking office.
UK Treasury officials welcomed the measures to boost the economy and open
markets, but said it was not clear that they would bring recovery. Mr John
Major, prime minister, begins a visit to Tokyo at the week-end.

FT  17 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Dixons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For Dixons it is a case of YES as in no. The company has finally got rid of
its recently renamed US subsidiary Your Electronic Superstore. YES is better
known as Silo, in which guise it has cast a long shadow over Dixons'
shareholders.
In selling YES/Silo to the Fretter group - whose subsidiaries include the
quirkily-named Fred Schmid Appliance &amp; TV Co and Dash Concepts - Dixons is
at least capping the losses which have made its detour into the US such a
disaster. Since YES is being sold as a going concern, Dixons avoids the
large hole that would have been punched in its net worth by the costs of
closure. While Dixons loses some assets, the 30 per cent of Fretter's shares
which it acquires in return limits the write off to Pounds 19.8m.
Fretter's retiring family shareholders get a cash payment equal to the
current market value of its shares. Yet since that is less than the net
asset value of the company before merger, a combination of the assets put
into the enlarged Fretter group give the management a decent chance to make
a go of the business. If it works, Dixons' equity stake will give it a
chance to make money, but potential further losses are limited to the
Dollars 50m holding value of the investment.
Much Dixons management time has been wasted in the US trying to find a
solution to the problems of Silo. That effort can now be usefully redirected
towards the UK. Ironically, Dixons only bought Silo when it failed to get
Kingfisher. When Kingfisher failed to get Dixons, it bought Darty in France.
But that, of course, is a different story.

FT  17 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: RMC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Price rises in UK building materials are finally sticking. True, the modest
increases achieved by RMC stem from attrition among producers rather than
higher volume. With cement prices rising as well, not all of the increases
in concrete and aggregates flow through into profits. Still, the company is
taking the opportunity to rebuild margins. Having seen UK operating profits
hit a trough in the previous six months - at Pounds 1.4m on turnover of
Pounds 400m - that is not before time.
While construction activity remains depressed, further margin gains will be
hard-won. Since RMC is shy about the breakdown of profits in its UK business
 -which includes the Great Mills DIY chain - the benefits of a housing
market revival are also difficult to predict. With more than half of
turnover and profits coming from Germany, though, the bigger risks and
rewards might lie elsewhere.
The hope is that profits from RMC's Pounds 500m investment in eastern
Germany will rise faster than western Germany declines. So far the picture
is encouraging. Cheap Polish imports have not affected prices much. Despite
falling back in the first half, construction activity in the west is holding
up. Meanwhile RMC benefits from tax breaks for investing in the east which
are not fully reflected in its reported 26 per cent tax charge. Even at this
stage of the cycle and with its Berlin investment in progress, RMC has room
to buy growth. The aggregates business earmarked for demerger by English
China Clays springs immediately to mind.

The foreign exchange market seemed determined to look on the bad side of
yesterday's UK unemployment data. If August's 5,800 rise in the jobless
total really is a signal that the recovery is weakening, the chances of a
rate cut have presumably increased. That supposition, together with Mr
Norman Lamont's new onslaught on the prime minister, was enough to send
sterling lower. Whether there is much logic in this view is another matter.
Unemployment has risen slightly in each of the last two months but it is
still 70,000 below January's seasonally-adjusted peak. Mr Major may have
taken another knock from his former chancellor but he has little to gain by
reaching for the interest rate lever in reply. Mr Lamont himself blocked
this route by warning against politically-motivated interest rate cuts in
his resignation speech.
In their desire to sober up after the violent reaction to Wednesday's
inflation data, the markets may have overlooked the other message in the
unemployment figures. Average manufacturing earnings are still growing at 5
per cent, while the improvement in both unit labour costs and productivity
has slowed. The latter may be a statistical consequence of this week's
revision of manufacturing output, but lower production only makes the
earnings data all the more disappointing. At any rate manufacturing earnings
are hardly compatible with the inflation miracle which the gilts market has
been promising itself. Markets generally may be in for a rough ride as this
realisation sinks in.

FT  17 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Broken biscuits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who felt that McVitie's provided a rock solid core at the heart of
UB's international ambitions must have felt a chill when the margins on its
UK biscuit business slipped in the first half. The proximate reason for the
fall was an increase in raw materials prices following the devaluation of
the green pound, which was not passed on. Since UB argues that it has not
raised prices in order to defend its market share, and any efficiency gains
will probably be lost to competitive pressures, that margin erosion must be
viewed as permanent. Indeed, as the supermarket chains can be assumed to be
hanging tough on prices of own label biscuits, the capacity to increase the
price of branded products is very limited. The undermining of brands by own
label biscuits also bears an uncomfortable resemblance to the war-torn bread
market.
Cash flow from the high margin UK business has been used to fund UB's
international ambitions. North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific are
apparently the local markets in which UB wants to star, yet even when cash
flow was higher, it looked too small an engine to drive a global business.
The position in the highly competitive North American market looks the most
vulnerable since UB's Keebler holds a weak second position. Sale of the
business to a company like Pepsi with a strong distribution chain would
release cash to pursue the underdeveloped European snacks market. Whether
UB's distribution in Europe can be made sufficiently strong to support the
business is an open question.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Balladur calls on industry to minimise job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDOUARD BALLADUR, the French prime minister, yesterday urged industry to
minimise job cuts and to avoid using redundancies as the 'easy solution' to
difficult economic conditions.
His appeal came the day after the announcement or confirmation of about
13,000 job cuts by French companies, described by the press as 'Black
Wednesday'.
The series of redundancies, principally affecting public sector groups,
represents a blow to the government's attempts to curb unemployment growth.
The unemployment rate, now at about 11.7 per cent, is expected to reach 12.5
per cent by the end of the year, according to Insee, the national statistics
office.
Mr Balladur expressed concern at growing redundancies in French industry and
said that 'a modern and human economy cannot have as its sole objective the
obstinate search for financial efficiency'. He said industry must also take
account of 'the social dimension' of employment decisions.
An official at the prime minister's office said Mr Balladur's comments were
directed mainly at public sector companies. But the prime minister also said
private companies should only cut jobs 'as a last resort'.
The single biggest announcement of job losses this week came from Air
France, the lossmaking state-owned airline. The company said its difficult
financial situation led to the decision to cut 4,000 jobs, almost 10 per
cent of its workforce, by the end of next year.
Snecma, the state-owned maker of aircraft engines, announced it would cut
the equivalent of 775 full time jobs in 1994. Bull, the computer group,
confirmed an earlier decision to shed 6,000 jobs, including 2,850 in France,
by the end of next year, while Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics group,
confirmed plans for 1,700 job losses in the same period.
The wave of redundancies is not confined to the public sector, nor is it
likely to end with this week's announcements. Peugeot-Citroen, the private
sector car manufacturer, is expected by industry observers to announce more
than 4,000 job cuts next week in response to the depressed European car
market. Company officials declined to comment yesterday.
Mr Balladur indicated yesterday that the government would shortly approve
capital injections for some state-owned groups. But he declined to specify
the amounts or the recipients. The government is constrained in providing
funds for state industry because of its growing budget deficit, forecast at
FFr317bn (Pounds 36bn) this year.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Tokyo unveils Pounds 37bn spending programme: Consumers to
reap rewards of yen's strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new government yesterday announced Y6,150bn (Pounds 37.7bn) of
government spending, deregulation and measures to pass on the rewards of the
yen's strength to consumers.
The measures, the government's first big economic initiative, are designed
to help pull the country back from the edge of recession. To widespread
disappointment they fell short of proposing income tax cuts.
Business groups have urged tax reductions, but the seven-party coalition is
divided on fiscal policy and the ministry of finance is unwilling to lose
revenue.
That brings to Y18,350bn the amount set aside so far this year to stimulate
the flagging economy, after a Y13,200bn plan by the previous government in
April. Most of that has yet to be spent.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, admitted that yesterday's measures
were insufficient to revive the economy, but did not exclude further action.
The yen rose against the dollar, while Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. The
Nikkei average closed 445.64 points lower at 20,502.15.
The plans received a lukewarm reception from economic analysts. However,
they received a surprisingly cordial response from the US, which has been
urging Japan to stimulate the economy to restrict its record trade surplus.
Mr Laurence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary, who is visiting Tokyo,
said he was pleased to see Mr Hosokawa introduce such measures so soon after
taking office.
In London, British Treasury officials welcomed the measures to boost the
economy and open markets, as well as recent reductions in market interest
rates.
They cautioned, though, that it was not clear that the measures would
produce recovery. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, begins a visit to Tokyo
at the weekend.
Among yesterday's proposals are reductions or removal of state controls on
94 areas of economic activity.
Among the most important are a review of Japan's anti-monopoly law to
discourage cartels; simpler standards and certification procedures for
imports; recognition of international standards on building materials; and
more flexible rules on the types of bonds companies may issue in Japan.
Plans to pass on the benefits of the stronger yen to consumers include
temporary energy tariff cuts, cheaper domestic air fares and lower
international phone bills.
The yen's increase has started to feed through to a fall in import prices,
according to a government report yesterday. It said prices of 24 out of 35
imported goods surveyed, including whisky, cars, and beef, declined over the
first six months of the year.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Curbing Europe's steel aid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community's private steel companies are getting nervous. They
fear that the Commission may be preparing to support billions of Ecus in
government aid to their state-owned rivals in exchange for only minimal
steps to reduce the over-capacity which is bringing the industry to its
knees. In the past week, the mostly private German steel industry has
accused the Commission of going soft, while privatised British Steel has
threatened to boycott EC-wide restructuring plans unless a tougher line is
adopted.
The private steel groups' concern is understandable. Ideally, there would be
a total ban on state subsidies. This is not merely because handouts are a
waste of public funds. State aid also allows inefficient public companies to
compete unfairly against private manufacturers. Private companies may well
ask what is the point of a single market if state groups are allowed to
engage in such blatantly unfair trading.
Unfortunately, a total ban on aid is impossible. The bulk of the aid - to
Italy's Ilva, Spain's CSI and Germany's Ekostahl - has already been sunk and
cannot be clawed back. Moreover, it is unrealistic to expect the Italian or
Spanish governments to close down their entire steel industries. The best
that can be hoped for is that state groups will make the bulk of the
capacity cuts that are needed to bring the market into balance and that the
industry will be run on subsidy-free lines in future.
Difficult hand
Equally, private companies cannot really afford to boycott restructuring
plans. The industry is haemorrhaging to the tune of Ecu4bn a year. The
longer capacity cuts are delayed, the worse the position and the greater the
likelihood of more private-sector bankruptcies. The only way forward is to
rely on the Commission. The Commission in turn has a difficult hand to play,
since it needs unanimous approval from the Council of Ministers for its
decisions. The main fear is that the Commission will take an excessively
soft line in order to close the dossier.
The main practical question is how well the Commission is playing its
difficult hand. Until Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, puts
forward firm proposals on the three big state aid cases, it will be
impossible to give a definite answer. But at present, the signs are
reasonably hopeful.
The main positive sign is that the Commission's hitherto strong line has
forced all three states, in varying degrees, to embrace privatisation. Italy
plans full privatisation, Spain has pledged that a new mill in the Basque
region will be financed mainly by private capital, while the Treuhand,
Germany's privatisation agency, has promised that private funds will be
found for new investment in Ekostahl. The emphasis on private capital
provides the best guarantee for a subsidy-free future.
Clearly inadequate
But there are still two concerns. First, will the state-owned steelmakers
make sufficient capacity cuts to stop the need for future subsidies? Italy's
proposal to focus its main cuts on a plant that has not been operating for
two years is clearly inadequate, while Spain's plan to delay closures for
two years is also suspect. It would be unacceptable if losses were allowed
to continue for anything more than a short period after an overall
restructuring plan was agreed.
Second, is the current emphasis on private capital genuine? Given the
industry's overcapacity, it is unclear why rational private investors would
want to build new capacity in Spain and Germany or even buy an existing
debt-laden group such as Ilva. The natural fear is that governments will
find backdoor ways to sweeten investment by private capitalists.
The council of ministers meets next week to debate these issues. Sensibly,
the Commission has resisted the temptation to put forward formal proposals.
Although this means that a deal will be delayed at least until November,
that is better than rushing into an unsatisfactory one.
Nevertheless next week's meeting will be important. Pro-competition
governments must insist that future handouts are stopped and not disguised
under the cloak of privatisation. The Commission itself must be tough.

FT  17 SEP 93 / They'll huff and they'll puff . . .: The whole Gatt edifice
could be blown down if France vetoes the farm trade accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the moment last year when European Community agriculture ministers came
to vote on the long-awaited overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy, Mr
Ray MacSharry, the former EC farm commissioner, gave the Portuguese chairman
then in charge of the Council of Ministers precise instructions on how to
face down a threatened Italian veto. 'You go in; you ring the bell, and
whatever you do, you don't look up.'
Italy was not convinced enough of its case to make a fuss as the endorsement
went through. But the current French threat to veto Blair House - the EC-US
farm trade accord reached last November in Washington and made possible by
the CAP reform - is another matter.
As Mr Jean Puech, the French agriculture minister, reminded France's EC
partners on Wednesday, the farm trade imbroglio could lead to a full-blooded
crisis in an already divided Community. The EC and its international trading
partners need no reminding that Blair House is the foundation for hopes of
building a successful world trade accord under the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by the mid-December deadline. If
Blair House crumbles, it would almost certainly bring the whole edifice of
the Round down with it.
On Monday, therefore, foreign and agriculture ministers of the 12 meet in
Brussels, in what will be a lengthy attempt to find out, first, what the
French want, and second, to decide which demand can feasibly be pursued with
the Americans. A majority of the member states, as well as the European
Commission which negotiates trade deals on their behalf, rule out any
reopening of Blair House. Washington already feels the EC got the better of
the compromise, as its negotiators have made clear.
But the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur made an electoral
pledge earlier this year to veto Blair House if it was not renegotiated.
This commitment went rashly beyond the previous Socialist administration's
refusal to sanction the farm deal, until it saw what was on the other side
of the Gatt ledger - such as openings in services and enhanced market access
for manufactures, areas in which France is respectively the second- and
fourth-largest world exporter.
In essence, France opposes the accord's requirement to cut the volume of
subsidised food exports by 21 per cent over six years, maintaining this will
demand sacrifices of EC farmers beyond the severe price and production cuts
agreed under CAP reform. The Blair House cuts, Paris insists, would destroy
France's vocation exportatrice as the second-largest agricultural exporter
after the US, and turn swathes of rural France into a wasteland.
Isolated at first, Paris has pressured its partners into recognising it has
a genuine political problem with its farmers, even if it is partly one of
its own making. The French breakthrough came three weeks ago when Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany, presumably fearful of losing a Gatt deal, sundering
the traditional Franco-German axis and sparking an EC crisis, offered France
political cover by announcing that Germany too 'had problems' with Blair
House.
But since then, the EC side (including France), has tended to talk of
'refining', 'clarifying', 'amplifying' and 'interpreting' Blair House,
rather than reopening it. The US for the most part has been eloquently
silent. Amid the flurry of meetings, in Washington and across Europe, hopes
are thus rising that it will be possible to accommodate France. 'I don't
think there's that much room for manoeuvre, but there is some,' Mr Rene
Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, said yesterday, warning, however,
that 'there will be a cost to pay for concessions in agriculture'.
Part of the problem is disentangling from the amorphous list of France's
demands what are its strategic priorities and what is political
window-dressing. 'In our experience, you have to distinguish between the
battle cries and the strategic aims,' says a senior German official. 'They
are not unrealistic people,' he adds, 'they know what is at stake.'
France's strategic interest in agriculture is to get its and EC farm prices
down to world market prices, impossible in the past because they were pegged
to low levels of German productivity. This aim should be achieved by 1997,
by when the CAP reform price and production cuts Paris initially opposed
will have taken hold. Its underlying priority is to ensure this scenario is
fulfilled with no additional pain for its farmers. For if it is, France will
be one of the most competitive producers in the world, and free to export as
much as it can without Blair House curbs. That is because at world price
levels, export subsidies are redundant.
France's shopping list reflects this aim. It includes:
Freedom to shift the bulk of the 21 per cent volume cuts to the end of the
six-year period, by when, if all goes well, they will not be required. 'I
would say that is a contender,' Mr Steichen says. The Uruguay Round 'final
act' spreads the cuts evenly over the six years, but that is a document
still on the Gatt negotiating table; Blair House is vague on the matter.
No export volume limits on food aid, current EC food stockpiles or
value-added food products. Blair House places no restrictions on food aid,
as Paris must well know. On stocks, a deal may be possible. But in any case,
assuming a Gatt deal would not start until 1995, the production restraints
in the CAP reform would by then have reduced the exportable food surplus
well under the Blair House limits on subsidised exports. Grain stocks, now
building up at half the rate of this time last year because of CAP reform,
would be needed to fill the gap. Commission officials deem the added-value
food products demand 'impossible', but point out that Blair House only
covers 'primary processed products' like flour and cheese.
'Aggregation', meaning cuts applied to whole sectors rather than individual
products, allowing France, say, to sell more cheese if it cut more than
required on skimmed milk powder. 'Not realistic,' says Mr Steichen, given US
rejection last year at Blair House.
Guarantees that the export curbs will not deny the EC a share of any growth
in the world food market, for example in China. This could be fudged since a
growing market would raise world prices above EC target prices, freeing
Europeans to exort without subsidy.
Safeguards that export curbs would be relaxed in the event of large and
sudden movements in prices and currency parities. The problem here is that
the safeguards could cut both ways, working against the EC if these
movements were in its favour. But Blair House already contains provision for
higher EC tariffs on incoming food if the dollar weakens 10 per cent beyond
a parity with the Ecu fixed by the accord. France's quest for greater
protection against cheap US cereal substitutes like corn gluten, however,
looks hopeless, since the provision for EC-US 'consultation' in the event of
sudden surges was drafted by Chancellor Kohl's office, and France needs firm
German support to get its deal.
Extending the 'peace clause', under which the EC and US would refrain from
unilateral action against each other, beyond the six-year timetable. 'That
is a legitimate demand,' says Mr Steichen, widely shared by France's
partners.
On closer examination, therefore, a deal for France on agriculture may be
attainable, especially as French demands become more polished by intensive
diplomatic contact. 'I think the French now have a feel for how far they can
go,' Mr Steichen says.
Complications, however, could arise outside the Gatt farm chapter proper,
most obviously if Paris insists the EC should have the means to trade
sanctions similar to those under US '301' trade laws. Bonn strongly opposes
such a move.
Less tangibly, much will also depend on how the process is managed,
particularly on the European side, by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief
negotiator, and by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general. 'A disaster
as a result of an accident is more likely than a disaster because of
immovable positions', judges one German diplomat, who adds that the key, on
Monday, 'is not to give the French too much time'.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Personal View: EMS - time for some strong medicine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY EICHENGREEN and CHARLES WYPLOSZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reluctantly, Europe has entered the brave new world of the permissive
European Monetary System. If the pundits are to be believed, two principles
should now guide its monetary policies. Interest rates should be cut quickly
and radically to counter the recession. And under no circumstances should
governments tamper with the markets by imposing deposit requirements on
foreign exchange transactions. These two quite different points have one
thing in common: both of them are wrong.
The concern with high unemployment that prompts calls for interest rate cuts
is entirely appropriate. But central banks control discount rates, not
market rates. Market rates are determined by investors. Investors will
accept a lower interest rate on French than German bonds only if they expect
the franc to appreciate. To reduce market rates, a government must make
investors believe that its currency is going to strengthen. They must push
it way down now so it can recover later, allowing lower interest rates to
boost growth.
Suppose that radical discount rate cuts push the franc to the bottom of its
15 per cent band, half of which has been used already. Why should investors
believe that it will recover? If they expect the opposite, French interest
rates will rise rather than fall. The desire for lower market rates will be
frustrated. Rightly or wrongly, this is very much on the market's mind.
Indeed, long-term real interest rates - on which investment most depends -
have actually been higher in the UK and Italy , the two countries that
depreciated their currencies last year, than elsewhere in Europe. To
convince the markets that any depreciation is temporary, policymakers must
first commit themselves to restoring an EMS with teeth. Only then will the
markets know that depreciation today does not augur depreciation tomorrow.
Only then will looser monetary policy be certain to succeed in cutting
market interest rates and stimulating recovery.
If the single market is to be defended, there must be a move back to narrow
bands. However justified the debate over monetary union, there is broad
agreement over the benefits of completing the internal market. Exchange rate
fluctuations of as much as 30 per cent menace this achievement by imposing
on workers and companies in the affected sectors greater and greater pain.
The single market will be put at risk. The complaints of competitive
depreciation following sterling and the lira's departure from the EMS last
year underscore the threat. If Europe fails to restore exchange rate
stability, it will fail to complete the single market. This is too high a
price to pay.
But to restore 2.5 per cent bands, or even 5 per cent bands as proposed by
the monetary committee in July, would be 'deja vu all over again'. If the
last year has taught us one thing, it is that the EMS was flawed. Open
capital markets are incompatible with pegged exchange rates, pure and
simple.
This is why deposit requirements for institutions with open foreign exchange
positions, like those used in Italy in 1987-88 and in Spain in 1992, are
needed temporarily until the goal of monetary union is reached. The cost of
non-interest-bearing deposits with central banks would be passed on to those
borrowing a currency in order to sell it short. This is not a capital
control; investors could still engage in any transaction they wished. But it
would attach a cost to one-way bets against exchange rates and provide
central banks the speculation they need to defend currency pegs.
Foreign exchange traders for too many years were denigrated as a lower form
of life. But neither are they a higher form of life. No practitioner would
deny that financial markets are driven by hard instinct as much as careful
analysis; this is why they are regulated with margin requirements and
circuit breakers. Since when do currency markets have a god-given right to
be free of the sort of regulation to which other financial markets are
subject?
What robs attacks on this proposal of their force is their failure to offer
workable alternatives. The FT has recommended a faster move to monetary
union or international monetary reform on a global scale ('Speculators as
the scapegoats', August 17). Yet Germany has made abundantly clear its
unwillingness to accelerate the Maastricht timetable. Hoping to solve the
problem this way is whistling in the dark. The same holds for proposals to
reform the international monetary system over a wider area.
It is time for serious medicine, not wishful thinking.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Leading Article: The reform of healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN 40 of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies combine to advocate
the reform of healthcare services, the first reaction of health policymakers
will be to count the spoons. Many countries have curbed spending on
prescription drugs as part of measures to halt the growth in health budgets.
So it is not hard to detect self-interest in the pharmaceutical companies'
new-found concern for health economics.
Yet the study published this week by Pharmaceutical Partners for Better
Healthcare, the industry's new pressure group for health reform, offers
sensible proposals to deal with a policy challenge that cannot be ducked.
While some countries have succeeded in halting the growth in the share of
GDP consumed by health, most face a sizeable gap between demand for
healthcare and funding. The ageing of populations and new and more expensive
types of treatment maintain an upwards pressure.
All too often, national healthcare reforms are undertaken in isolation. The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has done much to
collect data on health costs and spending, and to analyse trends. But as an
intergovernmental organisation, it finds it hard to advocate solutions
unpalatable to member countries. The pharmaceutical companies claim with
justification that they have a 'unique global perspective' in what has so
far been an intensely local debate.
Cost-consciousness
That perspective has led them to construct a blueprint for healthcare reform
that seeks to create more competition in the funding and provision of health
services to increase efficiency. It also provides incentives to encourage
cost-consciousness among insurers and consumers. And it suggests a mechanism
for funding a basic package of health services for all without rationing by
price or queue.
Parts of the model are utopian - not least the idea of an omniscient risk
adjustment fund that would be able to help competing insurers provide the
basic package of services to all comers whatever their state of health. It
is also difficult to define that basic insurance package - attempts in
Oregon, New Zealand and some parts of the UK have not been unqualified
successes. And experienced health professionals may be unconvinced by the
study's view that there is no need for regulation of the pharmaceutical
industry in a competitive health system.
However, important elements of the model can be recognised in several
countries' health reform programmes. A recent OECD study found that several
European countries were converging in their health reforms in ways close to
the proposed model. This suggests that the model is both workable and a
target that countries could adopt in long-term structural reform strategies.
Shied away
Equally, the model provides a benchmark to evaluate reforms in progress in
countries such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, and those to be
launched next week in the US by President Bill Clinton. Many European
countries have shied away from the model's idea of asking patients to
contribute to their treatment. While the revenue raised can be modest, such
payments encourage consumers to adopt more healthy forms of behaviour and
discourage them from wasting health resources.
The UK health reforms have introduced greater competition between hospitals,
family doctors and other health providers. But the only competition between
the bodies that fund healthcare is on the margins, through the minority of
family doctors who control their patients' health budgets. With the overall
budget tight, a winter of hospital closures and lengthening queues for
treatment is inevitable in the absence of alternative sources of funding.
As for President Clinton's package, it seems to achieve at least one
important element in the industry's model with its promise of a universal
healthcare scheme. However, it should also be judged by the extent to which
it alters the incentives for doctors to over-treat, hospitals to over-invest
and patients to demand ever more expensive services. So long as insurance is
largely funded by employers, consumers will not have sufficient incentive to
argue for efficiency and economy.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Observer: Card carrying
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is your business card collection a monstrous heap spilling on to the floor?
Don't worry, it's just the recession.
Demand for business cards peaks during a slump, according to a study by
Rolodex, the US card company.
The theory is that sales staff have to work harder (and give out more cards
than usual) and redundant executives are busily 'networking' (and giving out
more cards).
Life must be very confusing for the sales rep selling business cards.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's election campaign is only four days old but the government's senior
economic advisers are already deserting.
Their departure is taken by some as confirmation that prime minister
Constantine Mitsotakis's conservative New Democracy party faces defeat on
October 10.
Miranda Xafa, economic adviser to Mitsotakis, is returning to the IMF. She
says two years of battling against politicians and central bank officials
have sharpened her enthusiasm for dealing with 'difficult economies'.
Nassos Zambaras, mainstay of the government's privatisation office, has
signed on with N M Rothschild, the government's main adviser on
privatisation.
Peter Doukas, the fast-talking finance undersecretary, is returning to
Citibank. George Alogoskoufis, a former London University economics
professor, plans to combine a job at Athens University with some private
consulting.
All four are now headed for jobs paying considerably more than a Greek civil
servant's salary.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Patrick Morrissey, the newly appointed chief executive of Newspaper
Publishing group, currently engaged in a bitter cover-price battle with
Rupert Murdoch's News International, was feeling rather circumspect
yesterday.
Andreas Whittam Smith's decision earlier this year to step aside as chief
executive and devote more time to the task of editing The Independent, the
daily newspaper he and two former Daily Telegraph colleagues launched in
1986, surprised some media-watchers. For one thing, there were no
immediately obvious candidates to follow in his footsteps. The headhunters
got to work.
One firm, Tyzack and partners, had already approached some younger
candidates before Morrissey, who is 52, was finally selected.
Tyzack conversed with one budding newspaper tycoon, who was rather piqued to
be informed that the salary was in the region of Pounds 85,000 - a sum he
considered rather paltry for the job.
Morrissey yesterday told Observer he did not wish to discuss the terms
agreed between himself and Newspaper Publishing. Nor would he be drawn on
how he plans to combat Murdoch's soaraway price-slashing Times, now only 30p
against The Independent's 45p.
'I think it's a very interesting new tactic in the market,' he said - quite
an independent view, given Whittam Smith's recent tirades against Murdoch's
marketing.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Observer: Private pasta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pietro Barilla, Italy's pasta and confectionery king, who died yesterday at
the age of 80, was better known to sweet-toothed continental Europeans and
South Americans than to Anglo-Saxons.
Business-hungry City of London bankers had long given up trying to gain
access to Barilla's top-security Parma headquarters, more akin to a defence
plant than a biscuit factory.
Even the toughest food industry multinationals despaired of ever taking over
the family-owned business, which now sells more than L3,300bn worth of
biscuits, foods and cakes a year.
Barilla, set up in 1877 by Pietro's grandparents, is a prime example of the
sort of private company which would add lustre to the pint-sized Milan
bourse, were it quoted.
But having once sold a majority stake to a multinational - America's W R
Grace in 1968 - only to buy it back 11 years later, Barilla was determined
never to lose control again.
Whether matters change now that a new generation is taking over is an open
question. Two of Barilla's sons are already in the business, while the
third, a former Formula 1 racing driver, has also recently joined.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Observer: Austerity driver
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not content with ordering a public sector pay-freeze at home, Kenneth Clarke
is preparing to take the gospel of austerity across the Atlantic.
During his first attendance at the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank at the end of this month, Britain's chancellor
will press for new action to increase efficiency and cut operating costs at
the two organisations.
Staff salaries and allowances will be high in Clarke's line of fire. Britain
is still smarting at having failed to block a 6 per cent increase in wage
bills for pampered officials at the two Washington organisations earlier
this year.
The British Treasury feels that it has already made some progress because
World Bank president Lewis Preston has promised that next year's bank budget
will be based on the assumption of zero real growth in operating costs.
But there are compelling arguments for putting still more pressure on the
bank and IMF.
Better cost control at the IMF and World Bank would assist the freeing of
resources, in turn helping poorer developing nations at a time when national
aid budgets are being squeezed.
And because Norman Lamont also took a tough line with the Washington
bureaucrats, Clarke would, for once, be doing something to meet the approval
of his waspish predecessor.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Directors' pay increasing as profits
fall and debt rises to pay dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J DENNIS HENRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on directors' earnings only touched on the surface of this
problem ('Directors' pay shoots ahead', September 9). A larger study of 529
companies from the FT index that have year-ends from September 1992 through
to May 1993, with a total turnover of Pounds 511bn, shows that the
highest-paid directors averaged increases of 10.4 per cent. The second and
third highest-paid directors achieved increases of 9.3 per cent.
While their companies increased turnover by 6.7 per cent, the profit before
tax fell by 13.9 per cent with margins slipping 1.3 per cent overall.
Ordinary shareholders' profit fell by 19.5 per cent but dividends rose by
7.7 per cent. This left the retained profit needed to finance the growth of
the businesses down 32.7 per cent. The result was that many had to borrow
more money to finance their dividends.
The average highest-paid director received 10.4 per cent more while profits
fell by almost 14 per cent. Yet this glosses over the many cases where much
higher increases were paid for even poorer results. There are too many to
list here in total and to identify only a few would be unfair. Overall, the
profit per pound of directors' emoluments has fallen by one-third in one
year.
The time is now here when rewards, at all levels, should be more closely
tied to changes in the real wealth created. When senior directors received
rises of about 10 per cent, the total wage bill rose by 2.3 per cent, the
actual change in added value created by these 529 companies fell by 4.2 per
cent and it was from this depleted added value that the 7.7 per cent
increase in dividends was paid. No wonder the retained profits fell and
borrowings increased.
If the institutions used their influence on boards to link remuneration more
closely to wealth created it would ensure that everyone's eyes were on the
same ball. Were each of the above companies then able to improve by only 1
per cent in key areas, other than by raising retail prices, they would
increase their added value by 6.9 per cent and their profit before tax by 30
per cent. This would raise the added value-to-pay ratio from its present
1.66 to where it was only two years ago, at 1.78. The margin would increase
from its present 6.82 per cent to 8.9 per cent; this compares with 9.09 per
cent only two years ago. Such improvements would, in themselves, not justify
increases as they would only be taking us back to where we were two years
ago.
Substantial increases should only follow large real gains.

FT  17 SEP 93 / What price a corporate halo: The spread of business ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 150 academics and executives have gathered in Norway this week to
discuss developments in a subject which, in spite of the recession, is
growing fast: business ethics.
As a discipline, ethics has taken root in universities and business schools
across the US, the UK and elsewhere. This month, Jack Mahoney, a Jesuit
priest, takes up his post as professor of business ethics and corporate
responsibility at the London Business School. Leeds University and
Manchester Business School have made similar appointments in the past two
years. Other educational centres in the UK, such as the Cranfield Institute
of Technology, have followed the lead of US business schools and started
courses in business ethics.
The subject is not banished to the academic world. Managers and consultants
almost match the number of academics at the Norway conference. Prof
Mahoney's chair is funded by a Pounds 1m bequest given by Mr Stanley Kalms,
chairman of Dixons, the high-street electrical goods retailer, from the
group's charitable trust.
Almost one-third of large UK companies and four-fifths of their US
counterparts now have codes of ethics. Most set guiding principles for the
organisation, as well as covering specific areas such as buying policies,
safety and environmental responsibilities.
For example, National Westminster Bank's code of conduct, published in
April, sets out the proper behaviour for its 90,000 staff in cases where
interests conflict and on accepting entertainment from outsiders.
Mr John Drummond, director of Integrity Works, a London-based ethics
consultancy, says one reason for companies to adopt ethics codes is to avoid
corporate embarrassments. He says British Airways introduced a code of
conduct after the bad publicity created by its 'dirty tricks' campaign
against its competitor, Virgin.
But he stresses that there are also positive reasons for companies to adopt
codes - particularly the perception that good ethics are good business.
Based on experience he gained at NatWest, he argues staff actually want to
discuss how they should conduct business. 'People want to talk about ethical
issues,' he says.
Dixons' Mr Kalms explained his interest in business ethics in personal
philosophical terms. 'Behind the bluff exterior of the practitioners of the
art of business are often citizens with doubts, moral uncertainties, even
spiritual black holes,' he said recently.
Lord Laing, who as chairman of United Biscuits was one of the first
industrialists to introduce a code of ethics into a British company, says:
'On the whole, business has a bad image. Anything we can do to improve it we
should.'
But the justification Lord Laing offers can only fuel the suspicion that
ethics codes are more about marketing a company than altruistic or
philosophical considerations. An example of the value of ethics as a
marketing tool is the 12-point code launched by the Co-operative Bank last
year, which stated that the bank would no longer lend to businesses or
organisations involved in activities such as blood sports or environmental
destruction.
Whatever the bank's wider motives, Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, has
spent considerable sums using the code as a way of attracting new business.
The value of customer deposits at the bank was 9 per cent higher in the six
months to July this year than the corresponding period in 1992.
Though the example of the Co-operative Bank reinforces claims that ethics
codes help boost earnings, there is a counter argument that they divert
attention from what some regard as the principal task of a company - serving
the interests of shareholders.
Mr Ian Smedley, a member of the Institute of Directors, cites from Adam
Smith's The Wealth of Nations to argue that profit making should take
priority and may be incompatible with the kind of business ethics being
advocated by academics: 'It is not from the benevolence of the butcher,
brewer or baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their
own self-interest.' Norman Barry, professor of political philosophy at
Buckingham University, says: 'A lot of business ethics is posturing.' He
sees ethics as a diversion that threatens to turn companies into 'welfare
agencies', blunting their competitiveness.
In defence of the explicit setting of ethical standards, Prof Mahoney, of
the London Business School, admits that 'one might be ethical and end up out
of business', but he says the subject cannot be dismissed easily. 'The
conduct of business is a major part of human activity, so one would need a
good reason to think ethics does not apply.'
Mr Stanley Kiaer, of the Institute of Business Ethics in London, says there
is a strong element of self-interest to embracing business ethics. 'If you
want good treatment from your suppliers, employees and customers, you have
got to show that you will do well by them,' he says. 'If you don't have
contented employees, sooner or later you will have trouble.'
One difficulty critics find in taking business ethics seriously is that its
theoretical roots are still rudimentary. While ethics has long been taught
in philosophy and theology departments, thinking on its more practical
applications is less developed.
There is also a more practical problem: the difficulty of evaluating how
effective codes of ethics have been in practice. For instance, General
Dynamics, the US conglomerate, introduced a code in 1985 which it has
distributed to its employees and covers topics such as receiving gifts from
outsiders. Between 1985 and 1991 the code and a related staff communication
programme generated nearly 30,000 inquiries from staff, provoking 1,419
sanctions such as reprimands and demotions. Some 165 employees have been
sacked.
But Mr Kent Druyvesteyn, vice-president for business ethics and equal
employment opportunities, stresses that any attempt to quantify the economic
gains derived from the company's code would be 'so difficult that it would
be nonsensical'. He rejects the notion that there is any simple connection
between General Dynamics' stance on business ethics and profitability, and
he says the code does not attempt to instil basic moral values.
'We're not in the business of replacing missing virtues in our employees,
but we owe it to them to tell them about slippery spots inherent in the
business process,' he says. 'In a society with a web of rules and
regulations, that makes good practical sense.' Detractors of ethics as a
subject worth taking seriously in a corporate environment will probably need
more convincing, but General Dynamics' pragmatism seems to be shared in a
growing number of companies.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Security of Israel dependent upon a
successful Palestine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From S GOLDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Gowers is to be congratulated for his well-informed Middle East
feature, 'Fragile hopes light the horizon' (September 8). He shows great
insight into Israeli-Palestinian affairs and his article is very well
balanced.
I would just like him to reflect upon his contention that the Palestinian
issue is 'at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict', because although it
has provided a useful rallying call for Israel's warring neighbours, I doubt
the Arab nations have every really wanted a separate Palestinian state.
Mr Gowers may agree with me that the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict lies
in the very concept of a Jewish state existing in the midst of Islam and
that sore will never go away, even if Israel were to retire completely to
its recognised borders.
There will never be a day when Israel can relax its security vigil, nor can
I visualise a time when the dictatorial Arab states will not fight among
themselves.
Unemployment and poverty in a Palestinian state are Israel's greatest
danger, and I hope that any international funding will be used wisely - not
to build huge industrial estates without the proper infrastructures to
support production and distribution.
My fear is that the goods produced will not reach the standards demanded by
the western world and my hope is that Israel will be permitted to provide
its expertise to promote Palestine's industrial future.
A successful Palestine will be Israel's greatest safeguard.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Organisation at root of stress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL BRYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While Lucy Kellaway notes that Silvea Thomas 'finds stress everywhere',
it is unfortunate that she promotes such a superficial remedy for workplace
stress (Management: 'Give yourself a pat on the head', September 8).
Stress at work is mainly caused by employers failing to identify clearly
what employees' tasks are; give the training and support to do those tasks;
offer any system to resolve difficulties as they arise; and provide a
reasonable work environment.
So if 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 workers are sacked (sorry, 'made redundant'),
I hardly think that 'stroking their hair or inhaling deeply' is going to be
of much help to them or to those remaining - who, after all, are left to
pick up the work of those made redundant.
While there are measures that can help individuals, it is much more
effective to deal with stress organisationally. At least the law in the UK
recognises stress as an issue of health at work. Since January this year,
employers must undertake a risk assessment of all health and safety hazards.
This includes stress.
Why wasn't this even mentioned?

FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Total cost of caesarean births in UK
is unnecessarily high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Miss BARBARA HEWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Three cheers for Joe Rogaly ('Birth rights and wrongs', September 14).
The costs to the taxpayer of unnecessary caesareans is huge. In 1989, a
caesarean cost Pounds 1,123, compared with Pounds 363 for a normal delivery
(House of Commons Health Committee, Maternity Services, vol 3). Leading
research shows little improvement in outcome with a caesarean rate over 7
per cent (Enkin Keirse &amp; Chambers, A Guide to Effective Care in Pregnancy
and Childbirth).
As some 650,000 women give birth in the UK each year, my guess is that a
national caesarean rate of 13 per cent in 1992 may have increased public
expenditure by some Pounds 30m.
Judging by the evidence heard by the health committee, the medical
profession engages in serious anti-competitive practices, in obstructing
women's access to midwives. GPs rarely inform women of their right to a home
birth with a midwife, referring them straight to hospital and an
obstetrician. Some obstetricians threatened women wanting home births with
detention under the Mental Health Act unless they agreed to a hospital
birth. Others told women that they 'needed' caesareans and had to go into
hospital. There, the need for surgery vanished: they delivered normally.
The Royal College of Obstetricians gave evidence that its practice was to
withhold information on risks of hospital births (though not of home
births]) from women.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pay is top priority for union members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALLAN KERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart's article on the future of trade unionism ('On the
lookout for the vision thing', September 6) cites a study I carried out for
Nupe in 1989 (not 1992 as stated). But the conclusions that he draws, namely
that among low-paid public sector workers, advice on disciplinary and
grievance issues comes ahead of collective bargaining as the reason for
joining a union, is almost certainly no longer valid.
Four years ago national pay bargaining was dominant, and did not directly
impinge on the workplace. But government initiatives, such as
contracting-out, National Health Service trusts and local management of
schools, mean that pay negotiations are increasingly a local matter.
Consequently, pay bargaining is now likely to be accorded top priority by
union members. Finally, and most importantly, it is essential to recognise
that individual advice and representation is a key benefit of trade union
collective organisation.

<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats are the scavengers of British politics. These are not
my words; I take the observation from Mr Jack Straw, a Labour frontbencher.
The Lib-Dems, says he, are politically promiscuous. 'They form casual
relationships of convenience with whatever party offers them the prospect of
power,' he writes in Renewal, a quarterly journal of Labour politics.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, scavenger-in-chief, must be delighted. He would not use Mr
Straw's imagery, but he would have to agree, possibly with pleasure, that
the insight is perfectly accurate. Since the April 1992 election, Mr
Ashdown's strategy has been to advertise his party's moral superiority,
while waiting to see which way history would take him. So far the answer is:
further than anyone might have imagined in 1989, when the reincarnated soul
of the old Liberal-SDP Alliance was struggling for survival in a new body.
How long ago that now seems. First Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the
Conservative party, identifies the Liberal Democrats as the principal threat
to perpetual Tory rule, and sends the prime minister scurrying around the
country to stop the rot. Then along comes a senior Labour politician to
argue, as does Mr Straw in his Renewal article, that in many of the Labour
heartlands, the Midlands apart, the Lib-Dems have replaced the Tories as
Labour's main opponents.
It would be neat, would it not, if during the 1990s the everlasting third
force in British politics cleft the Conservative party in two, destroying it
as the Alliance did Labour in the 1980s. Perhaps this is the kind of fancy
that leads Mr Straw to reject pacts or co-operation with the prince of
scavengers. The fools who advise Labour that 'one more heave' is all that is
required for Mr John Smith to become prime minister in a government
commanding a socialist majority will be heartened by his analysis.
There is another view, often rehearsed in centrists' dreams: that the
Liberal Democrats will become the alternative party of government by the end
of the century, as were the Liberals at the beginning. When this
thought-bubble rose above Alliance leaders' heads in the mid-1980s it was
based on the likely demise of Labour; today it is the Tories who seem to be
crumbling. We may hear some heady talk of the Liberal Democrats be-coming
the party of government during their annual conference in Torquay next week,
although Mr Ashdown has warned his followers, who are flushed with local and
by-election success, not to crow.
The truth is that most people are more fed up with traditional politicians,
and the two main parties, than they have been for many years. The new right
has outplayed its hand; the old left has become an anachronism. The market
for Ashdowns is wide open. Any leader who is untainted by office, or the
prospect of an immediate ascent to power, is in a position to attract
attention, as is any interesting-looking new non-socialist party. This is
not a uniquely British phenomenon, as we can see from the rise of Mr Ross
Perot in the US and the Northern League in Italy.
Mr Ashdown has particular advantages in riding this historic wave. The
Labour party is beginning to look unmodernisable, at least to the degree
sufficient to make it palatable to the southern voters it must win over if
it is to form a government on its own. The Conservatives are led by the
least popular prime minister on record. Since their fourth general election
victory last April, they have governed only in the sense that the Marx
Brothers once ran an opera house.
Mr John Smith is uninspiring. Mr John Major is cursed by a worse affliction.
He is unlucky. His latest torture is to endure the wrath of Mr Norman
Lamont, the man who less than three years ago ran his campaign for
leadership of the party. The former chancellor does not enhance his own
dignity by his persistent efforts to justify his past. He should let future
historians do that. They may be kinder to his tenure of the Treasury than
are most contemporary commentators. He missed his chance for glory a year
ago, when he allowed himself to be persuaded not to resign following the
departure of Britain from the exchange rate mechanism of the European
monetary system. He should have insisted on resigning. It is Mr Major's
humiliation to have such a man for an enemy.
From the Liberal Democrats' point of view, nothing could be sweeter. The
message the public is being given about the Conservatives is that they are
not only incompetent, they are tearing one another's eyes out. Every new
snippet of political or economic news is analysed for its likely effect on
Mr Major's future. The betting is turning against his survival in office
until the next election. I am not sure how far the Tories have thought this
one through. Throw out a leader every few years and a party may get a name
for inconstancy.
You may protest that none of this is serious. What matters is policy, not
personalities. We shall hear a little about political programmes and values
during the next three weeks, as first the Liberal Democrats, then Labour,
and finally the Conservatives meet in conference. The British polity being
what it is, however, we shall hear far more about personalities. Will Mr
Smith defeat the unions? Will Mr Lamont topple Mr Major?
The policy divide is between the anarchists of the new right whose thought
still predominates among Tories and the conservatives in the other two
parties. The latter want the re-establishment of a structured society
governed by familiar institutions, including local authorities, and new
regional parliaments. They regard individuals as citizens, not mere
consumers. They are greener and more pro-European than the Conservatives.
Labour is encumbered by a persistent dependence on trade union links and a
nostalgic hankering after equality of outcomes. The Liberal Democrats favour
competition, intervention only where markets fail, and equality of
opportunity.
In short, Mr Ashdown's philosophy is what Labour's could be if the party was
genuinely modernised. He even has the great merit, regarded with a jealous
sigh by some Labour frontbenchers, of leading a party untainted by the word
'Labour' in its name. This may not be enough. When the Tories are really up
against it, we shall learn the true meaning of the phrase 'political
scavengers'.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: A disappointing La Boheme - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new English National Opera Boheme is an occasion of several notable
firsts: first new production of the opera in London for 15 years; first new
production of the 1993-94 season and of the Dennis Marks-Sian Edwards ENO
administration; first Coliseum new production to be conducted by Miss
Edwards; first ENO collaboration of Steven Pimlott (producer) and designers
Tobias Hoheisel (sets) and Ingeborg Bernerth (costumes); house debuts of the
American soprano Roberta Alexander (Mimi) and the Welsh baritone Jason
Howard (Marcello); first outing for the new Jeremy Sams translation.
It is, as it happens, not the first Boheme to have left me utterly untouched
 -uncharmed in the early acts, unmoved in the later - but it is one of the
most completely disappointing. While evidently much hard thought and concern
for practicability went into its preparation, the total effect, as executed
on Wednesday, is of a strained, fitful ingenuity circumscribing the opera's
emotional amplitude. That the music seems to be offered in exact parallel -
with bright moments in the orchestral delivery and passing pleasures of
vocal utterance but with no overall unity of style or command of dramatic
paragraph - hardly helps.
Pimlott and his team have updated the opera to Paris in the 1950s (even if
period detail seems vague, sometimes contradictory). Their more widely
publicised novelty is to have joined up the four acts without interval and
presented them in a single set - a large, cold, ugly 'studio space' divided
down the middle by columns, capable of responding to different scenic
demands at speed though seldom with any gain in real dramatic fluidity (the
Barriered'Enfer roll-call makes no sense whatsoever).
In a programme note the producer suggests that doing the opera this way
might permit a fresh concentration on ENO at the London Coliseum, St
Martin's Lane, WC2: in repertory until October 27; production sponsored by
The IIR Group.
the opera's 'labyrinth of relationships', a fresh illumination of the
distinction between the everyday and the poetic in its dramatic unfolding
(underscored by Hugh Vanstone's fidgety lighting plot). I understand the
point he hoped to make. I find little evidence that he has actually done so.
The Left Bank revelry is a Big Number - Musetta, a tall, svelte Crazy Horse
siren as embodied by the handsome, warm-voiced Cheryl Barker, strips to her
gaine-combinaison atop a table - indicating that Mr Pimlott's success in
West End musicals has a heavy influence. Even here, however, a joyless
pseudo-efficiency blights the scene's simpler pleasures (apart from an
indomitable, word-relishing Alcindoro from Donald Adams, which he doubles
with Benoit).
Most of the time the production is a Boheme graph-analysis rather than a
full-blooded Boheme experience. There are exceptions to this rule: the
precisely touched-in details of the Bohemians' domestic life and their
different psychological roles therein (Christopher Booth-Jones's prissy,
super-sensitive Schaunard and Andrew Slater's Colline, surface-fuzzy but
razor-sharp beneath, are two of the show's plusses), and Marcello's
exuberant, volatile temperament (Jason Howard, in spite of intermittent
excesses of unvaried loudness, is the evening's star). For once,
unfortunately, Jeremy Sams's skill as deviser of new and witty English
rhyme-schemes and word-plays comes across as fearfully self-conscious, and
so the mood of the domestic encounters tends to be compromised.
Miss Edwards's first ENO Boheme veers between galumphing boisterousness,
with word-covering and voice-drowning a perpetual threat, and swoony
sentimentality. She is alive to the beauty and exact purpose of Puccini's
Act 3 scoring; her reading will surely develop beyond this erratic,
unfocused start. She needs to cherish her Rodolfo a good deal more - John
Hudson, pure-toned, small-scaled, inexperienced - and likewise cosset Miss
Alexander's 'difficult' (and on Wednesday sometimes fugitive) top register.
As an admirer of this soprano's heartbreaking Glyndebourne Jenufa and, in
general, of her distinctively colourful vocal style, I admit to a special
disappointment at the curiously blank quality of her ENO Mimi. She has been
invited to underplay the illness, a good idea that - like the staging as a
whole - seems to have gone badly wrong somewhere between rehearsal room and
opening-night performance.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: Carousel - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the heart of the National Theatre production of Carousel - which has just
transferred to the Shaftesbury - is Joanna Riding's performance as Julie
Jordan. After the show is over, what haunts you longest is her face. With
its wider-than-wide cheekbones, its distant, shadowed eyes, and its grave
composure (occasionally ravished by a smile), it is ideal for the loyal,
troubled, loving Julie. Everything Riding does - in speech, song, body
language, silence or stillness - is infinitely touching, and full of truth.
She is more real than anyone we expect to encounter in a musical.
Her performance alone is worth the price of admission; and Nicholas Hytner's
staging of the Rodgers-Hammerstein show has many other marvellous features.
I adore several of the songs. I love Hytner's pacing of every scene, the way
Bob Crowley's sets seamlessly revolve, and everything to do with Riding's
Julie and Michael Hayden's Billy Bigelow. And I am grateful for the
unobtrusiveness of the amplification, and the lack of School of Elaine Page
vocalisation.
It would, however, be hard to leave the theatre borne on a wave of unmixed
delight. The folks from Heaven are blaring, schoolmistressy creeps. Meg
Johnson (replacing Patricia Routledge in the National's cast) has neither
the vocal range nor the earthmother authority for Nettie; and Clive Rowe's
way of acting Mr Snow as a witless Mr Slow is horrid. Rodgers and
Hammerstein are simply too complacent in their presentation of women's
he-hit-me-and-it-felt-like-a-kiss passivity. And Hytner actually deepens
this flaw: he beefs up the sex-and-violence aspect and yet evades the female
masochism the show portrays.
The biggest single hit in this Carousel is the pas de deux for Julie's
daughter Louise (Bonnie Moore) and a fairground boy (Stanislas Tchassov).
This, and the other dances, were the late Kenneth MacMillan's last
choreography. They are, like everything he ever made, full of little
infelicities - and, like all his best ballets, full of basic large-minded
strengths. The pas de deux, though repetitiously adorned with lifts, flips
and catches that many dance-goers will know from such MacMillan ballets as
Romeo and Juliet and Manon, has nonetheless a harsh, headlong urgency that
is moving.
It is curious which of Carousel's several famous songs work best in context.
I find that (though it certainly jerks my tears) 'You'll Never Walk Alone'
rings hollow. But Carrie's 'Mister Snow', for all its winsomeness and
despite Katrina Murphy's tremulous singing, really is a ravishing lyric
outpouring; Julie's resigned 'What's the Use of Wond'rin' speaks right to
the heart; and Billy's Act One soliloquy looks right forward to Bernstein
and Sondheim, though they never matched it. As for 'If I Loved You', it is a
miracle of feeling and irony. The scene in which it first occurs, with Julie
and Billy fluctuating between timidity and fearlessness on the brink of
love, is Carousel's profound core, and here played with perfect sensitivity.
By the highest standards - Show Boat, The Boys from Syracuse, Annie Get Your
Gun - Carousel is not a great musical. There is a saccharine blend of
operetta and vaudeville. (A 1945 musical with no jazz and no swing]) But it
is far more melodic, subtle, and humane than any musical from the last 30
years. Right now, Carousel is the best musical in town.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: Young pretenders see it their way - Art Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As I left London's Tate Gallery after previewing the exhibition of Picasso's
sculptures to be held there in the spring, a gleaming black carrier bag was
pressed into my hand. My nostrils caught an aroma suggestive of first class
hotels, gleaming lobbies, scented guests crowded in a lift. The carrier
concealed another tiny bag, a black satin purse containing a sample of
perfume and a miniature lipstick.
A scarlet leaflet, boldly titled 'Works of Art' was not a list of the
sculptures by Pablo Piccaso about which we had just been lectured by Dr John
Golding, but a series of essays on the Art of Fragrance, the Art of Beauty
and the Art of Colour, promoting the perfume and make up which Picasso's
daughter Paloma has sold in her name. This very Nineties moment, the
conjunction of great art and an utterly trivial commercial object, was one
which many of the artists in 'Wonderful Life', my next destination, would
have relished, the little bag an appropriate talisman for a journey from one
way of seeing to another.
It is fitting that the Lisson show, which has run all summer, continues into
October, giving an opportunity to consider this selection of younger British
artists working in a manner which could be described as 'conceptual' with
the masters of painting who dominate the major galleries' autumn schedules.
Surely the dedication of Lucian Freud or of Agnes Martin must put these
young upstarts to shame?
While there is no denying the power of a lifetime's labour, the moving
evidence of the struggle to render form and meaning in paint, the Lisson
show is also striking. For the younger generation clearly demonstrates, as
well as a great inventiveness and variety of approach, a consciousness of a
particular history, that of the international conceptual and minimal art
movements of the 1960s and 1970s which this work both acknowledges and takes
forward. Partly this is an effect of place: the Lisson has been the champion
of such work for more than 20 years, an achievement summed up by 'Out of
Sight, Out of Mind' held earlier this year to coincide with 'Gravity and
Grace' the Hayward's own attempt to give a historical placing to the work of
that era.
However, the young artists wear their history lightly. Their works are not
pastiches or tributes but emerge from a consciousness which has absorbed the
lessons of predecessors such as Carl Andre, Daniel Buren or Michael Craig
Martin among many others, and imbued them with a contemporary sensibility, a
sensibility which accepts the complexities of the modern, technologised
world as a matter of course, absorbing both its most inspiring and its
crassest aspects as equally valid food for thought.
The use of non-traditional media such as film, video or photography, so
innovative 30 years ago, is second nature to them, while the sacred
integrity of the image, so hard won by masters such as Picasso, also comes
into question in an age of endless reproduction. These artists play
comfortably with such concepts, their concern not so much the achievement of
any kind of formal 'solution' but rather the creation of a shared awareness
of just how deceiving, and how inspiring, this world can be.
Much of the work makes use of particular technical devices to deepen its
meaning. In his 'Instamatic Paintings', Magnus Hammick includes unfixed
Polaroid prints which will eventually darken completely, the image
destroying itself as the temporary notoriety of their references (Asil
Nadir, Damien Hirst) also fades, leaving only the odd, rough cases in which
they are presented to become relics of recent history.
Siobhan Hapaska, in 'Heart', presents a wall-mounted minimal sculpture which
is also a loudspeaker broadcasting the strange babble of satellite
communication channels. But the technical devices employed can also be very
simple. Don Brown, in '12 Unpainted figures/Paris 1989' frames singly tiny
individual figures from one photograph of a crowd, their blurry outlines
emphasised by the pristine white mounts suggesting not only their anonymity
but also their fragility. For, although happy to exploit technology, these
artists do not celebrate its wonders, rather reuse them to turn the
attention back on individual experience.
Some also demonstrate a rather touching concern with nature. Christopher
Bucklow uses a pinhole camera to capture on photosensitive paper 'The Beauty
of the World', the effect of the sun's rays at different times of day
determining the colour of the print (a variation on a glorious pinkish
mauve.) To make 'Pear-Hawthorn Tree' Bucklow worked with the late gardener
Robert Garner, who grafted the hybrid of the title, a conjuncture decided on
for artistic rather than practical effect, the wonder lying in the skill as
well as in the finished product, displayed in an earthenware pot.
The show also has a political dimension, in the work of Christine Borland,
for example, but the politics are presented not as heavy statements of dogma
or intent but rather as investigations of consequences. Borland has had a
.22 Beretta semi automatic rifle fired at a sheet of glass, the resulting
shattering beautiful in itself but demonstrating very clearly just what
would happen to flesh in such an encounter. Her 'Blanket used on police
firing range, Berlin: repaired' while clearly showing the bullet holes in
the mundane brown fabric also shows how wounds can be mended, with care.
This insistence on looking - that we should see not only what might be
there, but what it might mean - is the most refreshing and challenging
aspect of this show. It makes the work of those participants who demonstrate
it (and not all are working with quite this subtlety or quality) well worth
watching.
'Wonderful Life', Lisson Gallery, 52-54 Bell Street, London NW1, until
October 16.

The 88 competitors in the Leeds International Piano Competition have been
whittled down to six; today and tomorrow each will play a concerto with the
City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Simon Rattle. BBC2 is
covering the event starting at 6.55 today, continuing until at least 9.30.
Later BBC2 begins another run of KYTV, the comedy about a naff satellite TV
station which, like so many things these days, includes Angus Deayton in a
leading role (10.00). Then, at 11.15, still on BBC2, an event which may
prove to be an inspired idea but which looks pretty odd to me: the first in
a series of compilations from That Was The Week That Was. It is one thing to
watch extracts from TW3 during a day of 1960s nostalgia, but are there
really more than a few vintage TV freaks who want to watch regular re-runs
of programmes 31 years old? We shall see.
Almost everybody seems to have said that the lines in the carefully scripted
programmes of Paul Merton - The Series are not as funny as his unscripted
lines in 'Have I Got News For You' (10.30 C4). They are right.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: Uchida launches piano season - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's Wigmore Hall is setting out on the new season with confidence in
its step. From the experience of the past year following its refurbishment,
it knows that audiences are attracted by the new facilities and is in the
position to plan an ambitious programme, notably of singers and pianists.
The 'International Piano Season' was launched on Wednesday with a recital by
Mitsuko Uchida. Thanks to its fine acoustics and intimate atmosphere the
Wigmore has always attracted some top pianists, but this selection seems
especially impressive: Ousset, Pires, Schiff, Alexeyev and Donohoe among the
18 to be heard, promising to rival the South Bank's old Sunday afternoon
series. If all are as good as Uchida's opening recital, they surely will.
The atmosphere was relaxed, the musicianship rewarding, the encores
generous. One sensed that Miss Uchida loves the hall, even if her affection
does not extend to its piano. When it re-opened, the Wigmore proudly
invested in a new Bosendorfer, but she spurned that gleaming new instrument
(I take it the Bosendorfer was the piano unceremoniously shunted to the back
of the platform) and played on the Steinway.
What to make of this change? Uchida is not a pianist to call on the
Steinway's ringing power, at least not at this venue; perhaps she thought it
wiser to steer clear of its brittle, aristocratic rival for this programme.
Her opening Haydn Sonata, Hob XVI in D, was anything but chilly or formal.
The playing relished every witty harmonic surprise, every dramatic
about-turn, using the full range of the Steinway's colours.
When Andras Schiff played Schubert's unfinished C Major Sonata, D840, in his
Schubert cycle at the Wigmore, he made a point of including the extra
fragments. Uchida just played the usual pair of movements, but ironically
her performance felt the more complete of the two. Where Schiff had
alternated between hushed calm and violent outbursts, Uchida showed how the
one grew out of the other, fusing into a deeper, more involving musical
personality.
That was the feature that distinguished the whole evening: a desire not to
settle into one frame of mind for long stretches at a time, but always to
sense shifts of feeling, new emphases, different colours. For Schumann's
Kreisleriana, which runs from poetry to passion and back again within a page
or two, Uchida's darting intellect was well nigh ideal. In the closing
minutes the music came close to running away with her, but better that than
caution. May all the Wigmore pianists have her adventurousness of spirit.

<TEXT>
Leading US personal computer maker Compaq Computer took a technological
plunge on Tuesday with a range of minicomputer-replacement 'multi-processor'
systems, writes Geof Wheelwright.
Known as the Compaq ProLiant family of 'file servers', they have up to four
computer processors in a single machine (the highest number ever offered by
Compaq).
ProLiant systems will come with specially-designed implementations of
Novell's NetWare, SCO's Unix and Microsoft's Windows NT Advanced Server on
four compact discs. These CDs can be used with the built-in CD-Rom player to
install any one of the operating systems - although users must first contact
their Compaq supplier to pay for a software 'key' to 'unlock' the operating
system they choose to install.
This system means users can have immediate access to the network operating
system of their choice without having to order it for inclusion with the
system. Compaq: US, 713 370 0670; UK, 081 332 3000.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Technology: Gaining the upper hand - Continuing a series on
drug discoveries, Clive Cookson considers developments for the treatment of
diabetes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pharmaceutical industry is beginning to give diabetes the attention it
deserves as one of the western world's most serious - and fastest growing -
chronic diseases. Diabetes and its complications already kill 160,000 people
a year in the US.
Prospects for the immediate future include easier ways to administer insulin
than the traditional self-injection, a new hormone to enhance the effects of
insulin, and the first drugs designed to treat the medical complications of
diabetes. Further ahead lies the possibility of curing or preventing
diabetes by intervening in the disease process at the molecular level.
Diabetes is ultimately an auto-immune disease, triggered by a combination of
genetic and environmental factors. The body's immune system destroys the
cells in the pancreas that make insulin, the hormone controlling blood
glucose (sugar) levels.
Until the isolation of insulin by Frederick Banting and Charles Best in
1921, anyone with the most severe form of the disease, known as Type 1 or
juvenile-onset diabetes, soon fell into a coma and died.
During the 1920s and 1930s two companies that still dominate international
insulin production today, Eli Lilly of the US and Novo Nordisk of Denmark,
set up plants to extract the hormone from pigs' and cows' pancreases.
Diabetics could then stop themselves falling into a fatal coma with regular
injections of insulin. But these were no cure; diabetes became instead a
chronic degenerative disease with a multitude of life-shortening
complications including poor blood flow, blindness, kidney failure and
severe nerve damage (neuropathy).
Worldwide sales of diabetic drugs were worth about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.6bn) in 1992 and are growing at about 10 per cent a year, according to
Lehman Brothers, the international securities company. Insulin has about 60
per cent of the market. The remainder is for 'oral hypoglycaemics' - drugs
taken by people with Type 2 or adult-onset diabetes, a less severe form of
the disease.
The most important development during the 1980s was the genetic engineering
of bacteria or yeast to make insulin identical to the hormone produced in
the human pancreas.
This 'human insulin' has the advantage that, unlike animal insulin, it does
not stimulate unwanted antibodies in patients. About two-thirds of diabetics
have now switched from animal to human insulin. Some were put off by reports
that patients on human insulin were more likely to suffer from acute
hypoglycaemia - a sudden and potentially fatal fall in blood sugar levels -
because it gave them fewer warning signs of an impending attack, such as
sweating and tremor. But the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin, published by
the UK Consumers' Association, concluded this year after reviewing all the
clinical data that human insulin was just as safe as the animal version.
At the same time, the insulin manufacturers are making it easier for
diabetics to inject themselves. In the 1920s, patients used a ground glass
syringe that had to be sterilised in alcohol every time it was used. The
minimum standard now is a throw-away plastic syringe with an ultra-thin
needle that causes little pain or skin damage. And more and more diabetics
are using convenient pre-filled injection 'pens'.
An alternative hi-tech delivery system is the insulin pump, which infuses
insulin slowly and steadily into the patient's bloodstream. Its advantage is
that it reproduces the hormone flow of a real pancreas more accurately than
injections. The disadvantages include cost (about Dollars 4,000) and the
inconvenience of always having a device about the size of a cigarette pack
strapped to one's body.
This year Novo Nordisk agreed to promote pumps manufactured by Minimed of
the US for its insulin preparations. But the Danish company estimates that
only 25,000 diabetics worldwide are on pumps while 750,000 are using its
Novopen injection systems.
Research aimed at removing the need for injections or pumps altogether, by
developing forms of insulin that could be taken by mouth or as a nasal
spray, has given generally disappointing results.
Several groups have come up with experimental forms of oral insulin. The
hormone is given a coating, such as gelatin and/or biodegradable plastic,
which protects it from digestive juices in the stomach and then releases it
into the bloodstream through the intestine walls. But none so far gives
sufficiently reliable doses of insulin.
Novo Nordisk spent a lot of time and money developing a nasal insulin
preparation, only to abandon the project last year after clinical trials
showed that it was not sufficiently effective at reducing glucose levels in
the blood.
The benefits of controlling blood sugar as tightly as possible were shown in
the results of a nine-year study sponsored by the US National Institutes of
Health, which were released in June. Type 1 diabetics who injected
themselves three or more times a day or used an insulin pump reduced the
risk of complications by more than half in comparison with those who had
only one or two insulin shots per day.
The study is likely to stimulate sales not only of pumps and injection pens
but also of glucose monitoring devices and disposable test strips, produced
by companies such as MediSense.
A quite different approach to better control of blood sugar is based on
another pancreatic hormone, amylin, discovered in 1987 by a Medical Research
Council group at Oxford University. It appears that Type 1 diabetics are
short of amylin as well as insulin, whereas Type 2 diabetics make too much
amylin.
A company set up in California to exploit the Oxford discovery, Amylin
Pharmaceuticals, is carrying out a clinical trial of AC137, a synthetic
version of the hormone. Preliminary results announced this month suggest
that AC137 injected with insulin helps to 'smooth out' the rise and fall in
blood sugar levels.
Amylin is also working with Glaxo, the largest UK pharmaceutical company, to
develop amylin blockers as drugs for Type 2 diabetics. Two candidates are
due to start clinical trials next year.
Drugs available today for Type 2 diabetics are 'oral hypoglycaemics' which
stimulate insulin production; the leading manufacturers are Hoechst of
Germany and Upjohn and Pfizer of the US.
Other companies are trying to tackle diabetes on a more fundamental level by
blocking the auto-immune reactions before they destroy all the patient's
insulin-producing cells. Drugs that suppress the immune system, such as
cyclosporin, delay the onset of the disease but their side-effects rule them
out as routine therapy. The hunt is on for more specific treatments; one
candidate is a 'fusion toxin' produced by Seragen in the US.
For a diabetic who has already lost all capacity to make insulin, the best
long-term prospect may be some form of artificial pancreas. Two US
companies, CytoTherapeutics and BioHybrids, have developed technology to
transplant insulin-producing islet cells into diabetics; the cells are
encapsulated with a semi-permeable polymer membrane to protect them against
destruction by the patient's immune system. Both systems work in diabetic
animals and are now beginning clinical trials, although they are unlikely to
be available commercially for several years.
One of the most active areas of diabetes research is in the treatment of
diabetic complications. The first drugs designed to protect kidney, nerve
and eye cells from the toxic by-products of abnormal sugar metabolism are
beginning to reach the market. 'Aldose reductase inhibitors' are one
category, pioneered by American Home Products.
Scotia of the UK is carrying out clinical trials of EF4, a mixture of fatty
acids extracted from evening primrose oil. It appears to protect nerve
fibres by increasing blood flow in the legs, feet, arms and hands.
David Tomlinson, professor of pharmacology at Queen Mary's College, London,
outlined a more radical approach to diabetic neuropathy at a meeting of the
British Pharmacological Society this month. He proposes to repair the damage
with neurotrophic factors, recently discovered compounds that stimulate the
growth of nerve cells.
The series will continue next month with an article on anaesthetics.
Articles in this series over the last six months have looked at
pharmaceutical advances in the following areas:
Epilepsy                      27 August
Arthritis                     27 July

Colin McAusland has moved from the FKI group, where he has spent the past
five years as managing director of Huwood International, to become managing
director of CRABTREE of Gateshead, producers of metal decorating equipment.
McAusland's move is, at least geographically, a small step; Huwood,
suppliers of equipment to the mining industry, and Crabtree are barely a
mile apart on the Team Valley estate in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. During his
time at Huwood he turned the business from a heavy lossmaker to a
profitmaker for FKI.
The Crabtree Group, which floated in June, is now seeking a substantial
acquisition. McAusland, 48, is succeeded at Huwood by Alan Davidson,
formerly financial director.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following its problems earlier this year, the London Ambulance Service has
appointed four new divisional directors and a director of personnel. An
inquiry last year into the failure of the service's computer system had
concluded that the single centralised organisation of the service was not
appropriate and that there was a need for a strong local focus.
According to Martin Goreham, the chief executive to whom the divisional
directors will report: 'We wanted it managed on a scale that people could
cope with and are now in the position of having the right management team in
place. We have the foundations to rebuild the service.'
Of the four new operating divisions - central, north east, north west and
south London - only one will be filled by a local person: Philip Saunders,
former director of north east Thames, crosses the river to become the
director for south London.
The other three will be moving south: David Carrington, who was national
training and development director in the Scottish Ambulance Service, is
appointed to north west London; Owen Disley, former chief executive of the
Merseyside Regional Ambulance NHS Trust, at north east London; and Don Page,
former chief executive of South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service, at
central London.
Andrew Brown, personnel director for Nestle and Clark Foods, has been
enticed on board as the new director of personnel.
Goreham says he is not asking his managers to emulate those at the
Northumbria Ambulance NHS Trust where a variety of money-raising activities
is being developed: 'We have hired managers, not entrepreneurs.' However,
those managers will have to have a commercial awareness in a service where
certain activities are being commercially tendered.
The posts carry salaries in excess of Pounds 45,000; MSL organised the
recruitment campaign.

FT  17 SEP 93 / People: Morrissey to join Independent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and Independent on Sunday
newspapers, has appointed Patrick Morrissey as chief executive from October
1 and to the board immediately.
Andreas Whittam-Smith, Newspaper Publishing's deputy chairman and editor of
The Independent, who announced his intention to stand down as chief
executive in July, said yesterday: 'The qualities and experience that
Patrick brings us are exactly what we need for our next phase of growth.'
Starting his career in marketing at J. Lyons &amp; Co, he eventually moved on to
the international division of Beecham Group in 1971, where his posts
included regional director. Morrissey, managing director of Mirror Group
Newspapers between 1985 and 1990, says that his first task would be to
'develop a business strategy for the next three to five years'.
Since leaving MGN, Morrissey, 52, has been managing partner of The Advantage
Partnership, working as a consultant to various publishing companies and
newspapers, including the Financial Times.
David Bell, the FT's chief executive, says Morrissey has 'been very helpful
to us, making a significant contribution to refining the overall strategy of
the group.'
Morrissey himself said that his time at MGN 'gave me experience of the
transfer of a newspaper group from loss-making into one making significant
profits. But I don't think there are any magical formulas.'
Bruce Fireman, a non-exec-utive director who has been on the board from the
inception, has resigned.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Management: The sorry tale of Tom and Lisa - Tim Dickson
became an extra at a training session on sexual harassment presented in the
form of a drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The action takes place on a Friday afternoon near Maidenhead, England, in
and around the offices of MaST, a human resources development consultancy.
Running time: approximately three hours.
ACT ONE (The prologue)
Enter 30 personnel and training officers (potential clients), a couple of
journalists and various MaST 'facilitators'. All sit, expectantly, facing
the stage.
The concept of business theatre - 'to challenge and stimulate people to
think in new and different ways' - is explained.
ACT TWO (The play within a play)
Enter Tom and Lisa, sales colleagues who share an office. Tom is carrying a
copy of Madonna's book Sex. He fancies himself - and Lisa. He makes a number
of suggestive remarks in the course of a discussion about an important sales
contract.
Lisa is not amused. ('I make my living by selling our products. If you want
sex, stick to Madonna.') Tom fails to take the hint, first puts his arm
round her, and later runs his finger down her arm. On the strength of this
she lodges a complaint.
ACT THREE (The dilemma)
The play is halted. The 'audience' of personnel officers and journalists is
divided into two groups to assess the action so far, to explore ways of
resolving the conflict between Tom and Lisa, if possible through mutual
agreement or reconciliation, if necessary through the law.
The two groups separately interview and counsel the actors who respond in
the characters of Tom and Lisa. Each group then briefs one actor on what to
do next, the hope being that the drama will end with the sales duo amicably
at their desks and the legal cloud lifted.
Earnestness and political correctness are in plentiful supply. No one doubts
that Tom is the cad. Debate centres on how to rebuild a harmonious working
relationship. Efforts to suggest to Lisa that she might just loosen up a
touch and to explain why Tom might have got carried away - his previous
colleague Alice was evidently a bit of a flirt - leave her unconvinced.
The other group instructs Tom to go back to the office, apologise to Lisa,
and lay down clear behavioural guidelines to govern their relationship in
future.
INTERVAL (tea and biscuits)
ACT FOUR (The denouement of the play within a play in which the actors ad
lib in character)
A surprisingly self-satisfied Tom is just putting the telephone down as Lisa
arrives for work. They begin - falteringly - to consider possible ground
rules. Both seem to be going through the motions. After a minute or so, of
discussion, Tom announces that their conversation is a bit academic; he has
just accepted a job with one of the company's big customers.
ACT FIVE (The epilogue)
Enter Dianna Yach, MaST consultant and legal expert. She explains that the
drama A Bit of Fun can be used as a tool for spreading awareness about
sexual harassment, a training programme, or an assessment vehicle.
Yach emphasises that sexual harassment poses a serious financial threat to
companies, as well as being an important human issue. Attitudes towards acts
of harassment, particularly sexual harassment, are hardening and industrial
tribunals are more willing to mark their disapproval in enhanced awards
against employers.
Following a decision last month in the European Court of Justice (Marshall v
Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority) the upper Pounds
11,000 limit on equality compensation in the UK has been declared unlawful.
Employers are vulnerable, insists Yach, unless they can show that they have
taken clear and positive steps to investigate a complaint, and taken
positive action should the complaint appear justified.
Tribunals are interested in the effects of behaviour, so it is not a defence
to allege that the individual meant no harm. As one UK law firm discovered
last year, employers can be held liable for what goes on at the office
Christmas lunch.
Information on the next production in early November from MaST, Hermitage
House, Bath Road, Taplow, Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 0AR.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Management: Curbing the office pest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European companies can no longer ignore the problem of sexual harassment.
Governments, trade unions, employers' bodies, industrial tribunals, the
press, equal opportunities groups and countless victims have made sure of
that.
The latest initiative comes from the European Commission, which has just
published a booklet* explaining how to construct a policy aimed at stamping
out sexual harassment. It is based on the Commission's code of practice,
published two years ago.
The code consists of a two-pronged - it includes measures to prevent
harassment from occurring in the first place and measures to find ways of
tackling it once it has happened. It urges companies to: Issue a statement
spelling out what counts as harassment, making it clear that such behaviour
is unacceptable and describing a procedure through which employees can
complain.
Make sure that employees know about the policy.
Place responsibility on managers to make sure harassment does not occur in
their areas.
Provide training for managers and for staff processing complaints.
Set up formal and informal channels for dealing with complaints.
Designate someone to give advice and assistance.
Make sure cases are investigated quickly and by a committee set up for the
purpose.
Mete out suitable disciplinary measures to guilty parties.
Slowly, companies are beginning to realise something needs to be done. The
telephone lines have been increasingly busy at the UK's Equal Opportunities
Commission, which runs a service advising employers on how to combat
harassment. In 1990, an average of one employer a week used the service. By
last year, the EOC was receiving about two inquiries a day and the numbers
are rising.
A similar picture emerges from recent research by Industrial Relations
Services, the pay and conditions research group. It found that a third of
British employers had a policy to deal with sexual harassment and a further
third were considering introducing one.
However, the mere existence of a policy does not mean it is having any
impact. Indeed, it seems many companies have policies which fall short of
the EC's guidelines. A recent survey by the Industrial Society shows that
more than a fifth of UK employees do not know if their organisation has a
sexual harassment policy or not.
The EC booklet says companies without a policy are open to litigation from
employees who have been the victims of harassment.
Agnes Hubert, head of the European Commission's equal opportunities unit,
says a policy may also save companies money. 'Organisations should think
seriously about the cumulative cost of replacing staff affected, paying sick
leave to employees who miss work because of stress, and the implications of
reduced productivity - all expensive drains on morale and efficiency', she
says.
The priority attached to the issue varies in different countries. The report
is peppered with best practice examples from the Netherlands, where many
organisations have gone beyond the guidelines by instituting training and
setting up external complaints commissions.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Management: Fuelling a new popularity - Drivers are turning
increasingly to diesel cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fleet managers must have been struck by last month's UK car registration
figures, which showed a 79.4 per cent leap in diesel sales. More than one in
every five new cars sold is now a diesel and Citroen, one of the market
leaders, believes the figure could rise to one in three by the end of this
year.
Some companies are switching all or part of their fleets to diesels to take
advantage of their better fuel consumption. On the whole they are 25 per
cent more economical than petrol-driven vehicles.
A flurry of surveys has indicated that the UK may be witnessing one of the
most significant shifts in business fleet acquisition policies since the
company car sector first sprang into life in the 1970s.
What emerges from them are changing driver attitudes towards the car, with
greater concern about costs and the environment increasingly replacing
performance-oriented obsessions of the 1980s. The sector's growth is also
being facilitated by the reduction and, in some cases, disappearance of the
price premium demanded by manufacturers.
Diesels can be expected to receive a further substantial boost from company
car taxation changes which come into effect next April, under which tax
payable will be based on car prices rather than engine size. The larger
engine capacity required by a diesel to provide performance comparable with
a petrol unit currently remains a considerable tax disincentive to company
car drivers choosing a diesel model.
The disadvantage may be further offset as early as the Budget in November.
Diesel economy will become relatively more attractive if, as some industry
analysts believe, the government imposes a sharp increase in overall motor
fuel duties to compensate for its Pounds 1.6bn revenue loss from abolishing
Special Car Tax.
Two recent surveys illustrate the upsurge in diesel popularity:
One, undertaken among 190 fleet managers by Fleet Management magazine and
the leasing subsidiary of BRS, the fleet management company, found that 61
per cent expected diesel cars to outnumber petrol models on their fleets,
which on average numbered 390 vehicles.
Eighty-five per cent intended to increase the number of diesels on their
fleet over the next 12 months and 98 per cent believed fleet operators
generally would increase the number of diesels on fleets.
The survey also indicated that nine out of 10 fleet operators now believe
diesels are more environmentally 'friendly' than petrol-engined equivalents.
Harris Research Centre, in a poll of 1,072 drivers in the UK, France,
Germany and Italy, also showed that around half will consider making their
next car a diesel. In the UK, 11 per cent said they had already decided to
do so, with the figure rising to 22 per cent in France. In a similar poll in
1989 only 3 per cent of drivers in the UK said they would definitely buy
diesel. Drivers in the Harris survey were both business and private
motorists.
According to statistics from Automotive Industry Data, the motor industry
monitoring organisation, diesels took a 19.6 per cent share of total west
European sales in the first quarter of this year, compared with 17.3 per
cent the year previously.
According to Jack Fryer, managing director of Lucas Industries' automotive
division which commissioned the Harris research, it is unlikely that the
price premium for diesels will be eliminated entirely.
But he says that advances in technology have already solved or are solving
other current perceived negatives such as noise and a slight delay in
starting while glow plugs warm up.
'The diesel will never take over the GTI market but it probably has a
natural market level of 30-35 per cent,' he maintains.

FT  17 SEP 93 / British National party wins by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE far-right British National party last night won its first-ever local
authority seat after a campaign fought on a rights-for-whites platform.
Mr Derek Beackon, 47, the party's candidate, was elected by a majority of
seven over Labour after a re-count in the east London borough of Tower
Hamlets.
Police in riot gear and on horseback fought to control clashes between BNP
supporters and anti-racist campaigners as the result was announced.
The result was: BNP: 1,480; Labour: 1,473; Liberal Democrat: 1,284;
Conservative: 134.
After his election Mr Beackon described the result as a great victory for
the British people. 'The British people are no longer prepared to be treated
as second-rate citizens in their own country,' he said.
Mr Peter Hughes, Liberal Democrat leader of Tower Hamlets Council, said the
result brought shame to the area and was a 'blot on the history of Tower
Hamlets'. When Hitler bombed the area so heavily in the second world war he
could never have hoped that he would eventually be so successful, he said.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'This is very, very bad
news for all those who are committed to democratic politics.'
He urged mainstream politicians to make clear their commitment to tolerance
and their opposition to 'racist-based parties'.
There has recently been a series of outbreaks of racially inspired violence
on the streets of Tower Hamlets and there are fears that increased BNP
activity as a result of the election victory will aggravate the problem.
Mr Hughes said the council would continue to treat all citizens equally and
was determined that there should not be disorder on the streets.
The by-election took place on the Isle of Dogs. Although parts of the area
have become occupied by affluent residents in riverside apartments, the
large majority of the population still live in council flats. Frustration
over housing policies, according to all the main political parties, played a
part in the election.
The turnout yesterday was 44 per cent compared with only 31 per cent in
another by-election contested by the BNP in the same area last year. Leaders
of the three main parties believed that the higher turnout indicated that
the electorate was registering a protest against the BNP, but the result
proved them wrong. The far-right party more than doubled its 657 votes in
last year's by-election.
Police continued to patrol the streets of east London in force early this
morning after the declaration of the result.
The BNP victory will add to pressure on the government to strengthen
Britain's race relations laws.

LABOUR turned its fire on the Liberal Democrats yesterday, saying their
local government record contrasted with the stance of the party's MPs.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, ridiculed Mr Paddy Ashdown,
Liberal Democrat leader, as posing as a UK Ross Perot. 'Our very own
anti-politics populist,' he said, was like the former US presidential
candidate in claiming to be an outsider taking on the political
establishment.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Lib Dems take control of Dorset council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats last night won control of Dorset County Council in a
by-election victory which will cause further alarm for the Conservatives in
southern England.
County councils now controlled by the Liberal Democrats are Dorset,
Cornwall, Somerset and the Isle of Wight. Since the local elections in May,
the Conservatives have been left in control of only one county,
Buckinghamshire.
In Dorset, the Tories lost control in May when the Liberal Democrats gained
17 seats to leave them just one short of an overall majority. In yesterday's
by-election their candidate Mr Peter Gainsford took the Lytchett seat on an
11.5 per cent swing from the Tories. Mr Gainsford gained 3,047 votes against
1,879 for his Tory rival.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the win was 'tremendous
news', and added: 'In a fourth county we can face the challenge of
government and the chance it provides to show people what we stand for.'
The by-election had been ordered after the result in the May elections was
declared void by the High Court. The same three candidates had stood in May
when Commander 'Chipps' Selby Bennett, the Tory candidate, won by a single
vote. But one ballot paper, cast in favour of the Liberal Democrat, was not
accepted because it had not been officially stamped. Had it been, the result
would have been a tie.

FT  17 SEP 93 / New chief whip in Lords takes over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HESKETH resigned yesterday as government chief whip in the House of
Lords, to be replaced by Viscount Ullswater, a junior minister in the
Department of Employment
Lord Hesketh, who cut a colourful figure as chief whip, told Mr John Major
he wished to spend more time on family commitments.
He had wished to give up his post, with its formal title of captain of the
Gentlemen-at-Arms, for some time, but had waited until most of the
government's legislation for the current session had been passed.
The prime minister expressed the hope that Lord Hesketh might eventually
re-join the government.
His most notable achievement over the past two years was the safe and speedy
passage of the Maastricht bill through the Lords, despite the high-profile
opposition of a handful of senior Conservative rebels, including Lady
Thatcher and Lord Tebbit.
In other changes, Lord Henley becomes a junior employment minister; his
place at the Department of Social Security is taken by Viscount Astor, a
government whip. Lord Strathclyde, a junior environment minister, and
Baroness Denton, a junior minister in the Department of Trade and Industry,
change departments.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Productivity deal may go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned power group, is planning to implement an
employee productivity deal this year which has been held up as a result of
the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit for public-sector workers.
The company secured union approval for the deal just before the government
announced the pay limit last November. Its implementation would have led to
a significant improvement in the company's efficiency, but would have
increased earnings by considerably more than 1.5 per cent.
Such delays have been highlighted by government opponents who say rigid pay
policies can hurt employers as well as employees.
The government's latest pay policy, announced this week by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, means any public-sector pay rises will have to be
paid for in improved productivity.
While that is tougher on employees than the existing policy, it suggests
that Nuclear Electric's productivity deal, which would reform pay bargaining
and erode demarcations, may be feasible.
Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric's chief executive, speaking as the company
published its annual report and an environmental audit, said the company
would implement the deal if it could.
Even without the deal the company has improved productivity, measured in
sales of electricity per employee, by 23 per cent.
In addition, many employees have received pay rises of more 1.5 per cent in
the past year because they have benefited from 'gain share' schemes at power
stations. These rewarded productivity and were in place before last
November.
In the new productivity scheme the company would introduce single-table
bargaining in which all unions would negotiate in one forum.
There would also be greater teamwork. The company could not say yesterday
how much productivity would improve if it was introduced.
The annual report showed that the pay of Mr John Collier, the chairman,
increased from Pounds 188,000 in 1992 to Pounds 210,000 in 1993. The figures
included a bonus for 1992 of Pounds 29,000 and for 1993 of Pounds 45,000. Mr
Collier said the 1.5 per cent limit would apply to his pay rise this year.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Reluctant miners to sell HQ in Durham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURHAM miners have reluctantly bowed to history and put their Durham
headquarters - one of the most imposing union premises in the UK - up for
sale.
Red Hill, built in 1915 and financed by Durham Miners Association members'
contributions, is a domed baroque-style grade II-listed building with
landscaped gardens flanked by statues of Durham miners' past leaders.
The complex, which includes a Georgian villa, a gatehouse and houses for
officials of the National Union of Mineworkers, was a powerful symbol of the
time when 180,000 men worked in almost 200 pits in the Durham coal-field.
Today just one pit remains - Wearmouth, which employs just 700 NUM members.
Mr Davy Guy, north-east area president, said the decision to sell Red Hill
was financial, but added: 'It's been made with a heavy heart.'
The NUM would prefer the building to be sold to to a union or educational
organisation, and for ideological reasons is unenthusiastic at the prospect
of Red Hill becoming a corporate headquarters.
But Wilson Kinnair Commercial of Blyth, Northumberland, the agents, believe
office or hotel use might be appropriate. Tender offers are invited by
November 16.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Campaign aims to curb late payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cashflow Commitment, an attempt to shame businesses into paying their
bills on time, is to be launched by Manufacturing Challenge, the self-help
campaign to boost industry based in the north-east.
Companies in the region are to be offered a rubber stamp which will print on
contracts and invoices the words: 'We promise to pay on time - what about
you?'
The uncomfortable slogan is intended to exert pressure so that late payment,
which destroys some companies and cripples others, is reduced.
'Money is like manure - it only works if it's spread around,' said Mr Karl
Watkin, founder of Manufacturing Challenge and chairman of Crabtree, the
Gateshead-based metal-decorating equipment producer. 'If the cash locked up
in unpaid bills was released into the system it could be used by small- and
medium-sized businesses to grow and thrive.'
Late payment of bills was the main issue raised by north-east businesses at
clinics held this summer by Manufacturing Challenge. The 'challenge' is to
double the region's manufacturing base and treble its exports within a
decade.
The Forum of Private Business has estimated that British companies are owed
about Pounds 50bn in overdue debts.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Record number of tourists visit Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECORD 18.5m tourists visited Britain in the 12 months to March, 8 per
cent more than the previous year - and the British Tourist Authority said
yesterday that it was expecting even higher numbers this year.
The authority's forecast for this year, contained in its annual report, is
based on figures for the January-to-June period when there were 8.5m
visitors, up 10 per cent on the same period last year.
Launching the report, Ms Adele Biss, who chairs the authority, said: 'We are
forecasting an even stronger year to come as we reap the benefits of
devaluation and the move away from simple sun-bathing to the more fulfilling
holidays that Britain offers.'
Spending by tourists in the year to the end of March grew less dramatically,
increasing by only 7 per cent to Pounds 7.9bn. Tourists have bought cheaper
holidays, cut short their length of stay and taken advantage of heavy
discounting by the tourist industry, the authority said.
Ms Biss added that Britain was still perceived as an expensive destination
'so delivering value for money will continue to be paramount'.
Travel from North America was up 18 per cent last year on 1991 - but tourism
from the US that year was hit badly by the Gulf war. The number of Americans
has still not recovered to 1990 levels. Growth in visitors from south-east
Asia was strong, with tourists from Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore
increasing by 22 per cent and from Japan by 21 per cent.
Of the nearly 10m tourists from other European Community countries, France
and Germany provided the greatest number of visitors: there were 2.5m
tourists from France (up 8 per cent) and 2.3m from Germany (up 6 per cent).
The authority said it had raised a record Pounds 26m from the industry for
tourism promotion worldwide. For every Pounds 1 spent on marketing overseas,
up to Pounds 56 in extra tourist expenditure was generated.
The authority, which last year had an income of more than Pounds 46m,
reported that it now promotes Britain in 65 countries and has recently set
up new offices in Milan, Lisbon and Johannesburg. Overseas staff dealt with
more than 1.5m enquiries and a further 600,000 were handled by the British
Travel Centre in London. Research showed that one in four overseas visitors
to Britain gets information from the authority before setting off, it said.
Sir John Egan is to become chairman of the London Tourist Board. Sir John
will remain as chief executive of BAA, which owns and runs the three London
airports. He takes over from Sir Hugh Bidwell, who is stepping down to spend
more time as deputy chairman of London Forum, the private-sector body which
promotes the capital.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Nuclear 'green' image boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC yesterday declared its aim of cutting energy and water
expenditure by 5 per cent this year as part of an attempt to improve its
environmental image.
The aim is one of a series outlined in the company's first environment
report.
It said it would stay within self-imposed radiation exposure limits for its
workers three times more stringent than legal requirements, and foster
openness and dialogue with communities. The nuclear industry has often been
criticised in the past for excessive secrecy.
Nuclear Electric's aims were published as it and other nuclear-related
companies prepare for the government's nuclear review which will determine
its future.
The review has been held up while government ministries debate the terms of
reference. The Department of Trade and Industry is the ministry most likely
to lead the review.
The company said yesterday that its power stations last year effectively
saved the emission of 55m tonnes of carbon dioxide, the main cause of the
'greenhouse' effect.
Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said 95 per cent of nuclear waste was low
level. Naturally occuring materials such as granite and Brazil nuts were
sufficiently radioactive to be comparable with such wastes.
'If I ate a chocolate Brazil nut I would receive a radiation dose of between
0.3 and 1 micro sievert. The annual average dose to a member of the public
from nuclear power is just 0.3 micro sieverts.'
He said when electricity was generated from nuclear power, carbon dioxide
levels released were only 4 per cent of coal-generated electricity and 8 per
cent of gas. The figures included mining of raw materials as well as
construction of the plant and its running.

<TEXT>
BOARD MEMBERS of the National Health Service are likely to become subject to
a code of ethics and business behaviour within the next few months, Sir
Duncan Nichol, chief executive, said yesterday.
In June Sir Duncan set up a task force to examine accountability and probity
issues following serious managerial failings in the Wessex and West Midlands
regional health authorities. He told a National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts conference in London yesterday that the proposed
national ethical code would be one of the likely outcomes.
Another probable result of the task force's work will be a register of
interests for chairmen, board members and directors of health authorities
and trust hospitals. 'Such a register of interest must reassure the public
that the people at the very top of each NHS body have a clear understanding
that private interests and personal gain must play no part in the conduct of
NHS business,' Sir Duncan said.
He added that the NHS was responsible for 15 per cent of public spending and
'mismanagement of these funds, or unacceptable risk taking, is a proper and
understandable cause for public disquiet'.
During the next six months every health authority and trust should begin to
look at its effectiveness as a board, he said. The task force would provide
guidance on good management, including:
Identifying functions that might be carried out by a company secretary
figure.
Establishing a schedule of reserved decisions that could be taken only by
the board.
Producing detailed guidance on functions and accountability of board
sub-committees.
Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Committee on Financial Aspects of
Corporate Governance which reported last year, told the conference that
boards must provide a proper degree of disclosure of information, and guard
against 'undue concentrations of power'.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Rebellious Tories ensure that Major faces a tough time: As
conference approaches, Kevin Brown examines leadership chalenge rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR returned from his Portuguese holiday three weeks ago
determined to draw a line under the series of setbacks which has undermined
his leadership since last year's general election. He has not succeeded.
The prime minister's strategy has been to dismiss talk of an autumn
leadership challenge as a product of the 'silly season', the summer period
when political rumours sometimes achieve unjustified prominence in the
absence of real news.
This approach sufficed while the rebellion was confined to backbenchers such
as Mrs Teresa Gorman, the rightwing MP for Billericay.
But it may not be enough to deal with the more substantial intervention of
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. Mr Lamont, sacked by Mr Major in
May, gave fresh impetus to the rebel campaign yesterday in newspaper
articles in which he scarcely bothered to conceal his contempt for the party
leader.
Mr Major's dismissive description of Mr Lamont's comments as 'rather sad and
disingenuous' prompted a declaration of loyalty from the former chancellor
last night, but the episode did nothing to calm the party's troubled waters.
Sir Teddy Taylor, the MP for Southend East, was only one of a number of
rightwingers claiming that Mr Lamont's views were shared privately by
several ministers.
However, in spite of all the huffing and puffing on the back benches, it
remains unclear whether, and when, a challenger will emerge.
One idea being discussed on the right is to put up a 'stalking horse'
candidate designed to tip Mr Major on to the slippery slope towards
resignation by demonstrating his unpopularity among Tory MPs.
Ironically, this was the strategy adopted in 1989 by opponents of Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, now Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister. Mrs
Thatcher crushed Sir Anthony Meyer, the rebel candidate, but was
sufficiently weakened to be defeated a year later.
The consensus is that Mr Major would be fatally wounded if more than 100 MPs
opposed him or abstained from voting.
But the problem for the right is that a leadership challenge can only take
place if 10 per cent of Conservative MPs request a poll in writing.
The rule book says that the identities of the MPs would be kept secret. But
nobody in the Westminster rumour mill imagines that the names could be kept
confidential for long.
This means that 34 MPs would have to declare openly that they want the prime
minister replaced. Mrs Gorman claims that sufficient disgruntled MPs are
prepared to stand up and be counted. Less committed observers question that
assertion.
The arithmetic may change, however, if Mr Major fails to demonstrate a clear
grip of the party over the next month.
The crucial test will come at the start of next month when the Conservative
rank and file gather in Blackpool for the annual conference. The signs are
that many are already in an angry mood.
This is partly because of the deep-seated unhappiness about the government's
performance on crucial issues such as the economy and law and order.
It is also a reflection of irritation about manipulation of the conference
agenda by party headquarters. For example, there will be no debate on the
extension of value added tax to heating fuel, although dozens of critical
motions have been submitted.
Mr Major, who is not a good conference speaker, will have to deliver the
performance of his life to still the campaign against him. But Mr Lamont is
not finished either. The former chancellor is widely expected to return to
the attack when he addresses a fringe meeting organised by the Bow Group.
Lady Thatcher will publish her memoirs next month. Any suggestion of
disloyalty by Mr Major during the 1990 leadership crisis will be seized upon
by rightwingers as further evidence of his untrustworthiness.
The outlook for Mr Major is not all gloom. His advisers have always claimed
that the government's problems would ease as economic recovery took hold. He
is also protected by the rebels' awareness that the most likely winner of a
leadership battle would be Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who attracts
equal dislike from the right.
Nevertheless, Mr Major's future remains unpredictable. Even if he escapes a
challenge this year, the leadership issue would be reopened by a poor
Conservative performance in the European parliament elections in June.
That, say the cooler-headed rebels, is the time to watch.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Ethics code for NHS boards proposed

BOARD MEMBERS of the National Health Service are likely to become subject to

In June Sir Duncan set up a task force to examine accountability and probity

FT  17 SEP 93 / Venables hits out at BBC Spurs claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY VENABLES, the former chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur Football
Club, last night criticised the BBC over its decision to run a special
edition of its Panorama programme which alleged that he improperly obtained
Pounds 1m to help him buy shares in the club.
The programme also claimed that he and his advisers engaged in a series of
business malpractices including nightclubs, printing and boardgames, and
that there were irregularities in the transfer of England soccer star Paul
Gascoigne from Spurs to the Italian club Lazio.
Mr Venables, who was sacked by Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Spurs and of the
electronics company Amstrad, is suing for wrongful dismissal.
Last night Mr Venables said: 'It is most regrettable that despite being in
discussion with the producers of Panorama, they failed to inform me of their
decision to broadcast this programme tonight.'
The Panorama investigation claimed that Mr Venables had raised Pounds 1m by
using one of his former companies, Transatlantic Inns. Two months after
resigning as a director he used its assets in a sale and lease-back
operation with another company, Landhurst Leasing.
The assets were the fixtures and fittings of three pubs leased by
Transatlantic Inns. They, together with another public house, which cannot
be traced, raised Pounds 1m. The programme claimed this money was paid to Mr
Venables' company Edennote and some of it then used for the purchase of
shares in Spurs.
The programme also investigated the Gascoigne transfer. Mr Venables has said
he pushed up the transfer price from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 6.3m with the
help of Mr Gino Santin, a London restaurateur. However, Mr Giancarlo Guerra,
Lazio's finance director, told Panorama that the deal was reached six months
before Mr Santin was involved and the offer was not increased. The fee of
Pounds 200,000 to Mr Santin was paid to a Swiss company.
Late last night Mr Mark Stephens, Mr Venables' solicitor, issued a statement
condemning the Panorama programme as 'wickedly ill-informed' and 'screened
with reckless haste'.
'The programme failed to comply with the BBC's own guidelines to producers
and did not provide Mr Venables with the opportunity to respond to the
partisan and flagrantly untrue allegations,' he said. 'Nor did it broadcast
the statement given by him to the BBC.'
The BBC said: 'Panorama asked Terry Venables to comment but he declined the
programme's normal conditions of interview.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / Former health executive sees benefits in pay limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S new public-sector pay policy could give a fresh impetus to
reforms in the National Health Service, the NHS's former director of
personnel said yesterday.
Mr Eric Caines, who left the NHS earlier this year, said the chancellor's
blunt warning to the public sector that there could be no growth in the pay
bill could only lead to the same or more work done by fewer staff.
He said there was huge scope for productivity improvements in the NHS -
principally through a significant reduction in the numbers employed at all
levels and all disciplines.
Mr Caines has consistently argued that at least 200,000 NHS staff, about one
fifth of the total, could be shed without having an adverse effect.
Mr Caines, now professor of health services management at Nottingham
University, said trusts should be grasping their freedom to set pay and
conditions locally, breaking away from central pay review bodies.
Management and staff at the local level, he said, should now be looking at
ways, within the pay ceiling, of giving staff 'worthwhile increases' from
next April as part of an overall policy incorporating a reduction in numbers
and a drastic redesign of many jobs.
However the NAHSPO, the NHS human resource management association, said
personnel staff believed that any efficiency savings, including those gained
by job losses, could not be ploughed into pay increases in the majority of
cases. Rather, the money would be needed to maintain financial stability
overall.
A number of trusts have started to look at their staff's skill mix but few
have made significant progress in achieving significant changes.

However, parliamentary approval of legislation might not be completed until

MR JOHN MAJOR was told yesterday that the Social Democratic Labour party is
ready to return to the negotiating table with the other political parties in
Northern Ireland, as long as there are no pre-conditions set by any other
participants, Tim Coone writes.
Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, met the prime minister yesterday evening and
outlined his party's position on the renewal of the talks. He sought
reassurance from Mr Major that no secret 'deal' had been struck between the
Conservatives and the Ulster Unionist party.
Mr Hume has said that any such unilateral deal outside of the established
negotiating process would wreck peace talks in the province, and would
seriously undermine his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein,
which he says are aimed at bringing about 'a total cessation of all
violence'.
Mr Hume said he told Mr Major that he will continue talks with Mr Adams
'until they reach what I hope will be a positive conclusion'.
Mr Hume added: 'I had what I regarded as a very positive and constructive
meeting.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / Tourist numbers reach new record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECORD 18.5m tourists visited Britain in the 12 months to March, 8 per
cent more than the previous year - and the British Tourist Authority said
yesterday that it was expecting even higher numbers this year.
The authority's forecast for this year, contained in its annual report, is
based on figures for the January-to-June period when there were 8.5m
visitors, up 10 per cent on the same period last year.
Launching the report, Ms Adele Biss, who chairs the authority, said: 'We are
forecasting an even stronger year to come as we reap the benefits of
devaluation and the move away from simple sun-bathing to the more fulfilling
holidays that Britain offers.'
Spending by tourists in the year to the end of March grew less dramatically,
increasing by only 7 per cent to Pounds 7.9bn. Tourists have bought cheaper
holidays, cut short their length of stay and taken advantage of heavy
discounting by the tourist industry.
Travel from North America was up 18 per cent last year on 1991 - but tourism
from the US that year was hit badly by the Gulf war. The number of Americans
has still not recovered to 1990 levels.
Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the airports operator, is to become
chairman of the London Tourist Board.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Optimism declines in labour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SLOW and patchy recovery is taking place in the labour market, yesterday's
figures from the Department of Employment showed.
The optimism of the spring, when unemployment fell for four successive
months, has waned following the news of a 5,800 rise in unemployment last
month, and a revised increase of 4,300 in July.
The picture is not as bleak as it was at the end of last year, however. The
jobless total, at 2.9m, is below that of eight months ago and the size of
the workforce in employment had its first quarterly rise for three years in
the second quarter.
The seasonally-adjusted figures reveal that over the past six months
unemployment fell by an average of 7,500 a month compared with a rise of
25,200 a month over the six months to February. The latest three months show
a reversal of the trend, with the total climbing an average 1,800 a month.
Unadjusted, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose
30,600 in August to 2.96m. This compares with rises of 71,500 in August last
year and 67,600 in August 1991.
One encouraging aspect of the figures was the news that the workforce in
employment grew by 20,000 to 24.9m in the three months to the end of June.
Employment levels had fallen in every quarter since the end of 1990, even at
the beginning of this year when unemployment was falling.
However, the number employed in manufacturing fell a seasonally-adjusted
11,000 in July compared with June and by 173,000 over the year to July. It
fell 206,000 in the year to July 1992.
The other main highlights of yesterday's figures were:
The rise in the seasonally-adjusted jobless total was confined to women.
Male unemployment fell by 2,000 in August compared with July while female
unemployment rose 7,800.
The number of people joining the count in August was 395,600, compared with
408,000 in the same month a year ago; 369,000 left the count compared with
346,000 last year.
Unemployment rose in all regions other than East Anglia, the south-west and
Scotland.
The stock of vacancies at Jobcentres - about a third of all vacancies in the
economy - increased by 400 in August to their highest level for over two
years. Seasonally-adjusted vacancies have increased on average by 1,500 per
month in the three months to August.
The underlying increase in average weekly earnings in the year to July was
3.5 per cent, the same as the rate in June. Average earnings for
manufacturing rose by 5 per cent in the year to July and for services by
2.75 per cent. Neither changed on the previous month.
Wages and salaries per unit of output - unit wage costs - in manufacturing
were 1.8 per cent lower in the three months to July than in the same three
months a year ago. This compares with a fall of 2.1 per cent in the three
months to June.
Manufacturing output per head rose by 0.1 per cent in the three months to
July compared with the previous three-month period. It was 6.7 per cent
higher than the same period a year ago.
The Department of Employment also released results of the spring Labour
Force Survey, a survey of 60,000 households designed to give a fuller
picture of the labour market.
The survey, which uses the internationally-agreed International Labour
Office definition of unemployment, found that 2.8m people were unemployed
between March and May, a fall of 3.2 per cent since the previous quarterly
survey. On this definition, 13,000 more people were unemployed than the
average monthly number shown by the claimant count.
The survey also said in the three months to May 24.8m people were in
employment, a rise of 0.2 per cent since the previous survey and 5.5 per
cent higher than spring 1984, when it was first produced.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Industry feeling effects of overseas downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORSENING recession in continental Europe has begun to feed through to
companies based in Britain's industrial heartlands of the Midlands and
northern England where growth in orders has begun to stall, two separate
business surveys showed yesterday.
Both the Yorkshire and Humberside CBI and the Engineering Employers
Federation in the West Midlands reported that sluggish export trade with
Europe was holding back business.
Members of the Yorkshire and Humberside CBI regional council said the
downturn in France and Germany had a 'severe' effect on them; and they were
also worried by pressure on government spending programmes.
Mr David Botterill, the West Midlands federation's chief executive, said
overall trends were still positive but the government 'must tread very
lightly in the manufacturing sector if the eggshell of recovery is not to be
broken'.
In the West Midlands, the federation's quarterly survey found that the
proportion of companies with growing export orders had declined to 20 per
cent, compared with 27 per cent in the second quarter.
It was the second successive quarterly decline in export growth after
sustained improvement over the four previous quarters. Meanwhile, the number
of companies saying they had lost orders rose for the third successive
quarter - up from 21 per cent at the start of the year to 27 per cent.
'Export orders reflect the deepening recession in the rest of Europe,' the
federation said.
A decline in domestic orders was also reported with 39 per cent reporting
growing demand in August - down from 46 per cent in May. The percentage of
companies reporting growth in total orders fell to 41 per cent from 48 per
cent.
Mr Botterill said: 'Most of our members believe that the recovery is very
fragile. It is disturbing that following two surveys in February and May,
when the net positive trend increased on all indicators, that the net
increase during the August survey, although still positive, appears to have
slowed.'
Investment plans, profitability and cash flows among engineering companies
were still moving ahead but at a slower rate than earlier in the year, he
added.
The CBI in Yorkshire and Humberside said the construction industry was also
in trouble, while overcapacity was leading to severe competitive conditions
and pressure on margins in many markets.
Mr Peter Lee, chairman of the CBI regional council, added: 'Things are
improving slowly but there is still uncertainty over investment plans and we
continue to hear of reductions in workforces. Until there is a turnaround in
the rest of the European Community, things will remain less than buoyant
here.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / Campaign to sell education abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday set up a trade group to
improve the UK's educational exports.
The aim is to improve the marketing of British further and higher education
to foreigners - which already contributes some Pounds 1.5bn annually to the
UK economy - and to make improvements in the markets for providing
government training schemes and scientific equipment.
Baroness Perry, who recently retired as vice-chancellor of South Bank
University, will lead the department's new education and training group. Her
priority will be to improve British competitiveness in bidding for training
contracts in developing countries which are funded by the World Bank and
usually awarded by national governments. She says the UK lags behind Germany
and the US.
The group will aim to re-establish links with Thailand and establish a hold
on other 'emerging markets', such as South Korea and Taiwan.
Baroness Perry claimed that Britain's hold on some of its traditional
markets had been weakened because universities and colleges had competed
against each other. She contrasted this with the closely co-ordinated
marketing effort by independent schools.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Gould urges return to full employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRYAN Gould, Labour MP for Dagenham, called on the party's leadership
last night to produce proposals highlighting the need for an interventionist
economic policy to secure a return to full employment.
He interpreted the acceptance of the full employment objective by Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, in his speech to the TUC last week as a belated
recognition that the 'cosy consensus' with the government on macroeconomic
policy had ended.
Stressing that Mr Smith's TUC speech had signalled 'a most significant shift
in policy', Mr Gould said it had met the demand of himself and others that a
line should be drawn under membership of the ERM.
Mr Gould said Labour could reclaim the freedom of setting its own policies
on interest rates, exchange rates and public spending with a view to meeting
'real economy targets like full employment'.
Mr Gould complained that Labour's treasury team had 'resolutely failed so
far to address these issues' and left a significant gap in policy.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Tax windfall helps soften budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TAX windfall from the tobacco industry and repayments of debt by local
authorities were behind a lower-than-expected budget deficit last month, the
government said yesterday.
The gap between public spending and revenues in August was Pounds 3.54bn,
compared with City expectations of about Pounds 3.7bn. The seasonally
adjusted figure brings the deficit for the first five months of the
financial year to Pounds 18.4bn, 28 per cent up on the Pounds 14.4bn at the
same time last year.
The figures are roughly in line with Treasury estimates that borrowing for
the full financial year will come to Pounds 50bn, up from Pounds 36.5bn last
year and Pounds 13.7bn in 1991-92.
Customs and Excise duties in August were boosted by an extra Pounds 400m in
tobacco duty resulting from a delayed price increase. Also the overall
deficit was contained by local authorities repaying Pounds 762m in August,
with repayments from public corporations totalling an additional Pounds
521m. However, the government borrowed Pounds 4.56bn, compared with Pounds
1.49bn in July and Pounds 3.96bn in August last year.
Cash receipts by the government came to Pounds 15.6bn last month and Pounds
82.4bn for the first five months of 1993-94, an increase of 3 per cent on
the Pounds 79.7bn collected in the equivalent period last year.
Government spending was Pounds 20.4bn in August and Pounds 101.4bn in the
five-month period. This was 7 per cent up on the Pounds 94.9bn spent in the
first five months of 1992-93.
Tax revenues suffered last month from a Pounds 5m net refund by the
government to companies on previously paid corporation tax. However, August
is normally a poor month for corporation tax revenues.
The overall borrowing figure benefited from privatisation revenues of Pounds
138m, arising from sales to the public of the third tranche of shares in
British Telecommunications.
Excluding privatisation proceeds, borrowing for the first five months of the
financial year came to Pounds 21.9bn, after Pounds 17.8bn in the equivalent
period last year.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Labour turns its guns on Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR TURNED its fire on the Liberal Democrats yesterday, saying their
record in local government contrasted with the stance of the party's MPs.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, ridiculed Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
Liberal Democrat leader, as posing as a UK Ross Perot. 'Our very own
anti-politics populist,' he said, was like the former US presidential
candidate in claiming to be an outsider taking on the political
establishment.
Yet experience of the Liberal Democrats in councils such as Lambeth and the
Isle of Wight, Mr Straw said, showed them to be 'scavengers' and 'political
chameleons'.
The attack underlines Labour's determination not to concede that the Liberal
Democrats stand a better chance of defeating Conservatives across southern
England. It comes two days after a Fabian pamphlet warned that the Liberal
Democrats' challenge to the Tories in the south could threaten Labour.
Both Labour and the Tories have now launched broadsides against the Liberal
Democrats before the party's conference in Torquay next week.
Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator, highlighted
his party's success in winning 36 seats from Labour as well as its 350 gains
from the Tories in the county council elections.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Directors face tough SE rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH NEW Stock Exchange rules will require directors of listed companies to
set out full details of their remuneration and compensation arrangements if
they are fired.
The new rule removes a loophole which allowed directors simply to make
available a document which contained few details but noted that fuller
information was available elsewhere.
The change is contained in the first revision of the so-called 'Yellow Book'
governing the release of company information since 1984. Its new provisions
come into effect on December 1.
Under the rules, wider access to directors' contracts will be required,
which will have to give details of a director's salary, bonuses and stock
options and performance-related pay. Annual reports will also have to reveal
the unexpired term of any director who is proposed for re-election at the
next annual general meeting.
However, the contracts will only have to be available from the date the
company's next annual general meeting is announced until the date the
meeting is held.
Under the old rules such information about elements of a director's contract
could remain off-limits to a company's shareholders.
Shareholders who succeed in ousting incompetent or profligate management,
only to learn that the severence terms of the director in question require
even more generous sums to be paid to him or her, have been particularly
vexed by the limited disclosure required until now.
The new Yellow Book also raises the thresholds which determine the method
for bringing shares to listing. From December 1 shares worth up to Pounds
25m can be placed entirely with the clients of the sponsor, up from the
previous ceiling of Pounds 15m. Equity shares with a value of more than
Pounds 50m must be marketed to the public, up from the previous ceiling of
Pounds 30m. Between these limits, shares may be marketed partly by a
placing, and partly by an offer for sale or intermediaries offer.
Other new rules are particularly aimed at biotechnology or scientific
research-based companies whose products may take many years to develop. The
exchange wished to set limits on these companies and any company seeking to
have shares traded must have been conducting its activity for at least three
years and be able to produce financial statements for that time.
Also, it must have attracted investment from professionals, be worth at
least Pounds 20m and have the raising of finance to bring identified
products to commercial exploitation as its primary reason for listing.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Law body urges end to hearsay rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Law Commission, the government's law reform advisory body, is calling
for abolition of the rule which prevents witnesses giving evidence
second-hand in civil court, known as the hearsay rule.
The rule has been criticised as confusing and unnecessary. It frequently
results in increased costs and delays by requiring witnesses to attend and
give evidence in person and can result in relevant evidence being excluded
altogether where they cannot attend court.
Judges are critical of the rule because the public finds it difficult to
understand or accept, which undermines confidence in the judicial system.
The rule is also difficult to reconcile with procedural changes introduced
in recent years which were designed to speed up cases and introduce a more
'cards-on-the-table' approach to civil litigation.
Although the commission recommends abolition of the rule it says there is
still a need to make sure litigants are aware of the limitations of using
hearsay rather than direct evidence.
It therefore proposes a number of safeguards, including a duty to give
notice to the other side of the intention to rely on hearsay evidence;
guidelines to help courts in assessing what importance they should attach to
hearsay; and the right for a party to call and cross-examine any witness
whose evidence has been given as hearsay by the opposing side.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Schools show wide variation in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATE SCHOOLS in England and Wales show wide variations in the way they
spend their budgets, the Audit Commission said yesterday.
The public-spending watchdog said that some schools had five times as many
administrators per pupil as others, while the percentage of school budgets
spent on salaries for teachers varied between 60 per cent and 80 per cent.
Schools in some areas have a much greater ability to raise funds from
donations and parent-teacher associations.
Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the commission, said that schools should
examine areas where their performance was significantly different from the
average, and take action to improve it if necessary.
Headteachers and governors now oversee total budgets of Pounds 11.6bn
following the government's introduction of local management of schools.
Governing bodies have made widely differing use of their power to set
headteachers' salaries, introduced in 1991.
The commission found that most schools had not increased headteachers' pay
at all during this period. But one primary school had awarded its head 11
points on the 50-point pay-scale (each point is equivalent to roughly Pounds
600), and two had awarded eight points. Total variation is from Pounds
22,404 to Pounds 50,682.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said the finding showed that delegated budgets had left many
headteachers without any pay rise. Grades awarded in GCSE and A-level
examinations are fair and accurate, the Independent Authority for Schools
Examinations said yesterday. It heard just nine appeals for exams last year.

FT  17 SEP 93 / New-look Albert Hall to be ready for millennium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Albert Hall in London, home of the Proms, sporting and musical
events, is to receive a Pounds 34m facelift, the body which runs the
Victorian building said yesterday.
The first phase in the refurbishment will cost Pounds 24m. The most
expensive element of that is the construction of an underground access route
from beneath the steps that lead to Prince Consort Road on the south side of
the hall.
This will enable trucks to come into the hall and greatly speed up backstage
operations and enable the area around the hall to be pedestrianised.
Mr Patrick Deuchar, the venue's chief executive, said yesterday that with
improved backstage access the hall could remain open for a further 40 days a
year.
The final stage of the development, costing another Pounds 10m, will be an
underpass for Kensington Gore, the main road which passes the hall. This
would give London a grand plaza and allow audiences pedestrian access to the
Albert Memorial and Kensington Gardens.
The scheme is planned for completion before the millennial celebrations on
December 31 1999 (and on December 31 2000, the true eve of the millennium).
The illustrations, left to right, show: the completed Pounds 34m scheme,
with a plaza extending to the Albert Memorial and Kensington Gore traffic
confined to an underpass; the renovated balcony area, which will revert to
its Victorian use as an art gallery; and the new service areas, with an
expanded restaurant, bar, ticket and reception space at the southern
entrance in blue, and the underground truck access in red.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Lilley battles to avoid freezing out old faithful: The
debate over fuel bill taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THRIFTY pensioners are threatening to cause grey clouds for Mr Peter Lilley,
the social security secretary.
Although they are a group much admired by the Tory party, which many of them
support, they have brought dark days for Mr Lilley as he draws up plans for
compensating people on low incomes for the impact of value added tax on
heating bills.
The government has already conceded that the normal arrangements for taking
account of the inflationary impact of the VAT change will not be enough.
The tax is due to be imposed on April 1 next year. Normally people on
benefit would have to wait until the following April to receive any increase
in payments. This time they will be compensated immediately the tax is
introduced.
The increases will be announced by Mr Lilley, probably on Budget day,
November 30. Almost all the Pounds 500m or so likely to be made available
will go to 5.3m people on income support, leaving little for those who just
fail to qualify, because their savings or incomes are slightly too high.
The government's social security advisory committee estimated that because
people on low incomes tend to have higher heating bills, compensation should
be at the level of Pounds 40 per person per year while VAT is levied at 8
per cent, and Pounds 90 when it rises to the full rate of 17.5 per cent from
April 1995.
Mr Lilley is expected to combine a general rise in income support with extra
increases in premiums paid to special groups, such as the elderly or single
parents, likely to be hit particularly hard by the rise in fuel bills.
But his greatest difficulty remains. Ministers have not agreed a way of
helping those people who fall just outside the income support safety net.
An increase in the Pounds 10 Christmas bonus to pensioners would be neither
targeted nor particularly effective. An extra increase in cold weather
payments would apply only to people who are already on income support.
Using eligibility for housing benefit or for council tax benefit as the
criterion for extra cash, assistance would reach people who are on modest
incomes just above the income support qualification.
But local councils rather than central government administer these benefits,
so unless claimants also qualify for income support, the DSS does not know
who they are. Trying to use local council data to reach claimants not on
income support would make administering such a scheme complex and costly.
There is one social security payment which would reach all pensioners over
80 - the category which contains many of the poorer pensioners - and that is
the age addition.
This has been allowed to wither away for many years, however, and to raise
its current 25p a week level now would merely be to draw attention to its
derisory level. It is more likely to be abolished in the current spending
round than it is to be increased.
The most straightforward ways of providing help - either giving an extra
increase in the basic retirement pension or increasing the number of people
eligible for income support - are too expensive to be seriously considered,
especially in the present political climate.
Ministers have consistently argued that targeting social security benefits
is the best way of using the available money to reach people in most need
without wasting money on those who are well off. This means, inevitably,
that there will be those who fall on the wrong side of the line that has to
be drawn.
The difficulty in this particular case is that those on the wrong side of
the line include a group dear to Tory hearts - pensioners who have saved and
made provision for their old age. They will be much in evidence at next
month's Tory party conference, whatever motions are formally debated.
No wonder Mr Lilley last week described his task as 'unenviable'.

FT  17 SEP 93 / TUC warning on health laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADES Union Congress will resist any attempts by the government to
dilute health and safety legislation, Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary,
said yesterday.
He called for trade unionists to act as 'whistle-blowers' if environmental
regulations were not observed and said it was as vital to develop 'green'
skills as any others.
Health and safety legislation is under review to see if some regulations can
be pruned. 'We are concerned that the basic application of the law is not
changed,' he said. The onus had to remain on employers to improve health,
safety and environmental conditions.
Mr Monks was speaking in Manchester at the opening of a three-day conference
on environmental issues organised by the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions. More than 100 delegates from 30 countries attended, several of
whom will go on to the government's Partnerships for Change conference - a
follow-on from last year's Rio de Janeiro summit on the environment - next
week.
The TUC believes environmental concerns will create jobs through development
of a 'green' industry.
'It is already becoming clear that employment and incomes are being
threatened by failure to adapt to best environmental standards,' said Mr
Monks. 'If we fail to develop to these standards, Britain will lose out.'
Mr Christopher Smith, Labour environment spokesman, said the Multilateral
Trading Organisation, to be set up to administer the new General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, must have environmental issues in its remit.
This would allow it to address problems caused by moving work from countries
with tight environmental controls to those with more lax regulations.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Schools show wide variation in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
STATE SCHOOLS in England and Wales show wide variations in the way they
spend their budgets, the Audit Commission said yesterday.
The public spending watchdog said that some schools had five times as many
administrators per pupil as others, while the percentage of school budgets
spent on salaries for teachers varied between 60 per cent and 80 per cent.
Schools in some areas have a much greater ability to raise funds from
voluntary donations and parent-teacher associations. While voluntary funds
raised as much as Pounds 140,000 in a year for some secondary schools,
others managed less than Pounds 20,000.
Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the commission, said that schools should
examine areas where their performance was significantly different from the
average, and take action to improve it if necessary.
Headteachers and governors now oversee total budgets of Pounds 11.6bn
following the government's introduction of local management of schools.
Governing bodies have made widely differing use of their power to set
headteachers' salaries, introduced in 1991.
The commission found that most schools had not increased headteachers' pay
at all during this period. But one primary school had awarded its head 11
points on the 50-point pay-scale (each point is equivalent to roughly Pounds
600), and two had awarded eight points. Total variation is from Pounds
22,404 at the bottom of the scale to Pounds 50,682 when all fifty scale
points have been earned.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said the finding vindicated his association's claim that delegated
budgets had left many headteachers without any pay rise at all.
He also described the figures for voluntary funds as disquieting, saying:
'The size of the sums being generated clearly demonstrates that parents are
putting their hands into their pockets to pay for essentials which should be
provided by national and local government.'
He added that he fully supported the commission's work, although he
emphasised that schools could legitimately decide to spend their budget in
different ways.
Grades awarded in GCSE and A-level examinations are fair and accurate,
according to the Independent Appeals Authority for Schools Examinations.
It said yesterday it had heard only nine appeals for exams in summer 1992,
although almost 5m subject entries were made. Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, greeted last year's results by suggesting that standards might
have fallen.
In 1991, 20 appeals were heard with nine allowed.

<TEXT>
THE South African government last night failed to persuade Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, to return to
constitutional negotiations after a three-month absence.
President F W de Klerk and most of his cabinet held eight hours of talks
yesterday with Chief Buthelezi and senior officials of Inkatha and the
KwaZulu black homeland whose government Chief Buthelezi leads.
Both sides said after the talks that progress had been made, but that no
immediate return to multi-party negotiations was in prospect.
'We made no decision about going back to the talks. It is just not possible
at present,' Chief Buthelezi said at a joint press conference with President
de Klerk, who nonetheless declared 'there is light at the end of the
tunnel'.
The two agreed to set up joint committees to seek further progress.
Inkatha left the talks in protest at a decision to hold multi-racial
elections next April.
Government officials believe it is essential that Chief Buthelezi accept the
constitutional deal which will eventually emerge from these talks. This
could be achieved without his party returning to the multi-party table. The
Inkatha leader has recently returned from Germany and the UK where he came
under heavy pressure to moderate his demand for autonomy in Natal.
Meanwhile an official of the African National Congress said the ANC
president, Mr Nelson Mandela, would ask the United Nations to remove
sanctions against South Africa when he addresses the General Assembly next
week.
Mr Stanley Mabizela said Mr Mandela would call for the repeal of all
remaining sanctions except those against arms sales. Previously, ANC
officials had insisted that the international oil embargo must also remain.
Parliament yesterday began debate on the first of four transition laws that
will give blacks a share of power for the first time.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S central bank has lowered the reserve to deposit ratio in a move to
lower interest rates and spur the economywithout reigniting inflation.
The central bank lowered the reserve against deposit ratio for current and
savings accounts by a full percentage point and the ratios for deposits by
0.75 percentage points. This effectively lowers the cost of capital for the
island's financial institutions, particularly for private sector banks.
It is the latest step in an expansionary credit policy and economic
revitalisation announced by the government in July. Professor Hua Ming-shu
of the banking department of Taipei's National Chengchi University said
single-digit growth in money supply since the beginning of 1993 illustrated
the lack of vitality in the island's economy.
Official growth forecasts have been reduced from 7 per cent to 6.1 per cent
this month. High lending rates have been important in discouraging local
investors, says Mr Hua.
The central bank began efforts to encourage local banks to reduce rates on
July 30 by lowering the interest rate for secured finance from 6.625 per
cent to 6.125 per cent. The bank also released NTDollars 10bn in savings
funds each month to push down lending rates. But local banks followed with
only minor cuts.
Earlier this month, central bank officials asked the three major state-owned
commercial banks - the Hua Nan Commercial Bank, the Chang Hwa Commercial
Bank and the First Commercial Bank - to cut lending rates.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BULLISH appraisal of Nigeria's prospects by a leading research firm
forecasts steady economic growth, rising oil output and a return to civilian
rule next year.
A report published today by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) predicts
that Nigeria's oil production will rise from about 2m barrels per day now to
2.5m by the end of the decade.
Annual real GDP growth will stay above 4.5 per cent over the same period,
the London-based research firm forecasts.
The study expects the military-backed interim administration, which took
office last month following the annulment of the June presidential poll, to
fulfil its pledge to hold fresh elections next year and hand over to a
civilian government. 'Short-term volatility should not cloud what is a
fundamentally optimistic prognosis in the long-term, with the establishment
of a stable government committed to an open economy,' says the report.
The next administration will have little room for manoeuvre in its economic
policy, it argues, and will be obliged to implement lapsed economic reforms
and enforce 'disciplined and transparent management of the public finances'.
Nigeria 'desperately' needs to reschedule its external debt, which by
end-1992 was Dollars 29bn, calculates the EIU study, with service payments
'roughly one third of all foreign currency earnings.' But rescheduling will
not take place, the report continues, 'until the government demonstrates its
intention to adhere to an adjustment programme' which wins International
Monetary Fund approval.
One essential condition, says the report, is the removal of the subsidy on
domestic fuel which accounted for more than half the federal government's
recurrent expenditure in 1992.

THE South African government was last night struggling to persuade Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, to
return to constitutional negotiations after a three-month absence.
President F W de Klerk and most of his cabinet met Chief Buthelezi and
senior officials of Inkatha and the KwaZulu black homeland whose government
Chief Buthelezi leads.
Government officials said they would offer the Inkatha leader special powers
for Natal province, his political base, including control of an autonomous
police force as well as possibly a limited military force or home guard.
Natal may be allowed to adopt its own regional constitution before national
elections next year, though this document would have to conform to the
national constitution now under debate in multi-party democracy talks.
Government officials believe it is essential that Chief Buthelezi accept the
constitutional deal which will eventually emerge from these talks. This
could be achieved without his party returning to the multi-party table. The
Inkatha leader has recently returned from Germany and the UK where he came

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council yesterday imposed an arms and oil
embargo on the Angolan rebel movement, Unita, for its refusal to abide by
the terms of a collapsed 1991 peace agreement.
But it delayed the application of the largely symbolic embargo for 10 days
to see if fresh peace talks can be convened in the meantime.
The council threatened further sanctions if civil war between Unita, led by
Dr Jonas Savimbi, and Angolan government forces has not ended by November 1.
These could include a trade ban and travel restrictions.
The interim measure is expected to have limited effect because Unita has
large stores of armaments and Angola produces oil in Cabinda. But the UN
action could deter countries like neighbouring Zaire from supporting Dr
Savimbi.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, estimates that more than
1,000 Angolans are dying daily in the war or from its effects - the largest
death toll in any current conflict.
Mr Venancio de Moura, the Angolan foreign minister, told the security
council that the situation in Cuito, which has been under siege for eight
months, was so desperate that people were eating human flesh to survive. He
accused Unita of 'horrendous massacres' and urged the council to impose
mandatory sanctions to force the rebels into negotiations.
Dr Savimbi submitted peace proposals last Monday that would establish a
ceasefire beginning in a week, but his forces continue to shell Cuito. They
are estimated to control all but one-fifth of the country.
The UN arranged and monitored elections last year which it hoped would
establish a popular government and end the carnage. But Dr Savimbi rejected
the outcome which gave victory to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos's MPLA
party, alleging widespread fraud.

peace agreement appear
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first fruits of the agreement signed this week between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation began to emerge yesterday.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, flew to Egypt for talks on setting up a
Palestinian police force, an Israeli team made plans to visit Tunis for
talks on refugees, and the US confirmed that it would release Dollars 30m in
security assistance to Jordan which it had blocked since the Gulf war.
The establishment of Palestinian police units to take responsibility for
security in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho after the first stage of Israeli
troop redeployment is one of the main priorities for the PLO.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, stressed on Tuesday that he would
judge the PLO commitment to peace on its ability to end violence in the
occupied territories.
The PLO is expected to hold talks with Hamas, its main rival in the
territories which has opposed the peace process, in Yemen later this month.
There has been no indication yet from Hamas leaders they are prepared to
halt attacks on Israeli forces in the West Bank and Gaza, even after the
troops have withdrawn from the main areas of population.
Mr Arafat said after talks in Alexandria yesterday with President Hosni
Mubarak that he was grateful for Egyptian assistance in training a police
force and other professionals. He also described Egypt as the principal
architect of the plan to introduce limited Palestinian autonomy first to
Gaza and Jericho, asserting that Mr Mubarak had first put the idea to Mr
Rabin when the two men met in April.
'It would be unjust to say that Egypt played a role. Egypt was more than a
participant in what we achieved. It was a complete and full partner,' said
Mr Arafat. His statement followed criticism in Cairo newspapers that Mr
Arafat had not mentioned Egypt's role during his speech at the White House
on Monday.
Mr Amr Musa, the Egyptian foreign minister, said the talks had also focused
on convening committees to flesh out the peace pact and arrangements to be
taken before the actual transfer of authority from Israelis to Palestinians.
'We discussed certain steps such as negotiations on the withdrawal of
Israeli forces from Jericho and Gaza, the committees that will prepare for
elections there, and the arrangements and co-ordination with Egypt and
Jordan concerning the return of displaced people and matters pertaining to
the established administration,' he added.
In Amman yesterday officials expressed their satisfaction at the US decision
to release the Dollars 30m in blocked aid. The released funds comprise
Dollars 15m in economic support, Dollars 9m in military aid, Dollars 500,000
for military training and the remaining Dollars 5.5m for general projects.
The decision also reflected US satisfaction at Jordan's improved
participation in the imposition of sanctions against the Iraqi regime of
President Saddam Hussein.
US officials said yesterday they were examining other ways of pushing
forward the process, including convening a meeting of potential donors to
back the Israel-PLO accord.
The State Department on Wednesday hosted a day-long meeting with senior
officials from the White House, National Security Council and US Agency for
International Development to discuss a possible aid summit.
President Bill Clinton also made a 40-minute telephone call to President
Hafez al-Assad of Syria to assure him of US support for an eventual
Israel-Syria deal. He also urged Mr Assad to rein in 'rejectionist'
Palestinian opposition to the PLO-Israeli accord. At least 10 rejectionist
groups are based in Damascus.
Israel confirmed yesterday that it was sending officials to Tunis for talks
on Palestinian refugees. The visit is intended primarily to prepare for next
month's multilateral round of talks on refugee issues which were scheduled
to run in parallel with main bilateral peace talks in Washington.
Jordan also yesterday began asking Palestinians living in the country
illegally to register with the police. The measure appeared to apply to
residents of the West Bank and Gaza who came to Jordan on temporary visits.
Most of them have Jordanian passports but are limited to one-month stays in
the kingdom.
'This is only a routine measure to allow them to rectify (the status of)
their stay,' said a Jordanian official. 'We will not take any action against
anyone.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: Hosokawa's first economic package
fails to excite - William Dawkins examines Japan's Y6,150bn stimulatory plan
and what it is likely to achieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH IN size and scope, the first important economic initiative of the new
Japanese government headed by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa failed yesterday to
excite.
Even the prime minister could describe the package, a confusing mixture of
short-term pump priming and long-term reform to Japan's economic structure,
only as the best that could be expected at the time.
At Y6,150bn (Pounds 37.3bn) the package is dwarfed by the previous two
stimulatory initiatives - Y13,600bn was allocated in April and Y10,700bn
laid out in August last year. Government officials argued that it is
deliberately small.
For a start, 90 per cent of the previous package remains to be spent,
according to Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister. The bulk of this would be
spent only in the second half of this year, senior officials added.
On top of this, it is the first such package to include policy changes, with
its proposals for 94 steps to deregulate the economy and plans to pass some
of the benefits of the yen's rise to consumers.
The stock market was not convinced and slipped 2.1 per cent ahead of the
evening announcement, as details slipped out during the day.
A chorus of business leaders appeared on television just after the
announcement, complaining that Mr Hosokawa had not seen fit to respond to
their demands to cut income tax and that the Bank of Japan had not reduced
official interest rates. Instead, the package promises a review of the tax
system, to be carried out by a government panel due to report by mid-April.
The markets still think the central bank will cut its discount rate some
time this month, though it is being cautious because it wants to see more
companies get rid of surplus capacity before encouraging a further drop in
borrowing costs.
Private sector economic analysts estimated that the package includes between
Y1,000bn and Y3,000bn of genuinely new spending, with the rest coming from
existing government budgets or being shifted from one sector to another. 'It
is just not enough,' said Mr Tom Hill, strategist at S G Warburg Securities
in Tokyo.
Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, adds:
'Everyone should have known it was going to be disappointing. The politics
are so complicated, there was never more than a one in three chance that Mr
Hosokawa would have come out with something ambitious.'
The government's Economic Planning Agency, often criticised for erring on
the optimistic side, forecast yesterday that the package would add 1.3
percentage points to gross national product over the next 12 months.
So which bits of the Hosokawa plan will have most effect?
Most of the 94 deregulation proposals, which include and enlarge on the 60
deregulation measures announced by Mr Hosokawa two weeks ago, may harm some
sectors in the short term, but bring important benefits in the long term,
say analysts. A few promise instant relief, like a plan to deregulate part
of the bond market, which should give companies easier access to funds.
The most radical of the proposals to bring the rewards of the strong yen to
consumers, is for the government to publish a monthly list of the import
cost prices of basic goods, to exert moral pressure on high-priced retailers
to trim their profit margins.
The government also plans to urge importers to drop their prices, which will
prove an interesting test of Japan's tradition of administrative guidance to
industry.
On spending, the package takes a similar approach to the previous economic
stimulus plans, in that it seeks to improve Japan's creaking and heavily
loaded public infrastructure. However, it does have more focus than previous
plans on improving the quality of individuals' lives, with proposals for
example to build parks, museums, and build slopes for wheelchair users.
Cash is also being set aside for loans to small businesses, which complain
of a credit squeeze, for tax incentives on machinery purchases and to
enlarge government subsidies to companies in order to keep surplus workers
on the payroll.
It is, however, small beer. S G Warburg's Mr Hill estimates that the Y10bn
increase in employment subsidy will cover a mere 5,000 workers. Meanwhile,
few Japanese companies are likely to make much use of tax incentives for new
equipment, since most are trying to follow the central bank's advice and
slim capacity rather than increase it.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: 'The yen are too few, the ideas too
old' - A look at the political power exerted by Tokyo's ministries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the opposition Liberal Democratic
party's policy research council, was questioned after the announcement of
the package, he suggested that the yen were too few and most of the ideas
were old LDP proposals.
Mr Hashimoto did not specify whether the former LDP government had proposed
that Japan Tobacco donate 50,000 ash receptacles to the public, but the
state-owned tobacco company's contribution was counted in the package
announced by the coalition government yesterday.
JT's ashtrays were a symbol of the determination of state-owned companies
and ministries to donate to the campaign in order to revive and deregulate
the economy, though without doing themselves or the national budget much
damage.
The inability of the seven-party government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa to
extract more funds from the finance ministry and, perhaps, more ashtrays
from JT, is a measure of the difficulties that all Japanese governments face
in dealing with the bureaucracy.
Most of the deregulation proposals have been raised before, and there is a
sense within the bureaucracy that the Hosokawa coalition will not last long
enough to implement changes that would greatly undermine the power of the
ministries.
There is also surprise among Japanese companies at the willingness of Mr
Hosokawa to believe the finance ministry's warnings that a slowing of tax
revenue has made it impossible to produce a larger flow of 'real water', as
fresh funds are described.
A senior official at one of Japan's Big Four brokerages said he was not
surprised that Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, has followed the
ministry's line; this was because he is a former finance ministry
bureaucrat. 'But the whole government appears to be in the pocket of the
finance ministry,' the official said.
Mr Hosokawa was unable to win an income tax cut from the ministry, but still
argued that the package will have an effect. 'I don't think this is good
enough, but I believe that we have done the best we could do at the moment.'
One sign of the problems faced by Mr Hosokawa's deregulation campaign was a
provision in the package giving ministries two years to suggest revisions to
anti-monopoly laws, which still allow the formation of industry cartels.
The seven-party coalition is divided over the emphasis that should be given
to deregulation, providing the ministries with a good excuse to delay
changes to the more sensitive issues, such as the abolition of cartels
tolerated under the present law.
Leaders of the Japan Renewal party, one of the coalition partners, have
suggested that Mr Hosokawa should concentrate on introducing political
reforms, and not allow himself to be 'distracted' by economic and foreign
policies.
The coalition has promised to introduce changes to the electoral system this
year, and Mr Hosokawa has indicated he will resign if the promise is not
kept. The presumption is that an election will be called when the changes
are made and and a new government formed.
But Mr Hosokawa's chances of another term as prime minister in a new system
will depend on public perceptions of his ability as administrator. The
economic downturn is putting these skills to the test.
LDP officials such as Mr Hashimoto insist that the coalition's policies are
a reheating of the former government's ideas and that Mr Hosokawa has even
repeated turns of phrase first used by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the former prime
minister. Mr Hosokawa is fortunate that the LDP, which ruled for 38 years,
is still prone to division.
Six MPs from the LDP quit their factions yesterday in protest at the party's
inability to reform itself by abolishing the system of intra-party factions.

go-ahead

THE EMERGENCY package endorsed further deregulation of Japan's capital
market, including the introduction of new products, such as bonds with
shorter maturities and floating rate notes.
The proposals reinforce government pledges made in March last year.
Deregulation of the capital markets is already slowly under way, and will
not have an immediate impact on the economy.
However, in the medium term, a larger and more liquid corporate bond market
presents an alternative funding tool for companies at a time when bank
lending remains tight and the stock market has yet to see full-fledged
recovery.
Until now, short-term corporate paper has been banned by the ministry of
finance in order to protect the long-term credit banks, which finance
themselves with bank debentures.
Earlier this year, the finance ministry eased restrictions on companies
which are able to issue bonds, allowing a wider range of companies to fund
themselves through the bond market. Legislative changes allowing new
products is expected to accelerate the pace of reform in the bond market.
The ministry is also set to allow variable interest rate deposits and
interest bearing liquid deposits. A wider range of products will give
investors more incentive to place their funds at the banks, which are losing
depositers to postal savings, which offer higher rates.
Banks will also be allowed to accept medium and long term deposits, which
have previously been restricted in order to protect the market for 10-year
government bonds.
The government also pledged to reform the insurance industry, one of the
most tightly regulated in the financial sector. The sharp fall in the stock
market from 1990 has eroded the portfolios of the small life assurers, with
many of them in need for financial aid.
Liberalisation of the insurance industry, where barriers between life
assurers and non-life insurers will be eased, is expected to trigger
consolidation.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: Legacy of war overshadows Major's
visit - British prime minister adopts a softly-softly approach in quest for
increased business opportunites in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major, the British prime minister, departs for a six-day trip to
Japan, Malaysia and Monaco today, hoping that the long shadow of the Second
World War will not sour his hopes for a foreign policy triumph.
Much against Mr Major's wishes, the issue of compensation for servicemen
mistreated by the imperial Japanese military threatens to cloud his first
meeting with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, his Japanese counterpart.
Mr Major is being pressed hard by leaders of British POW organisations, and
will be unable to avoid raising the issue with Mr Hosokawa. But Mr Major's
advisers were keen to damp expectations of a quick breakthrough yester-day,
warning that Tokyo was unlikely to move beyond Mr Hosokawa's recent
declaration of apology for wartime excesses.
Senior British officials also stressed that the tone of the trip will be
very different from the last visit to Tokyo by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the
then prime minister, four years ago. Mrs Thatcher bluntly warned against
protectionism, pushed hard on a number of bilateral trade issues and left
her hosts with their ears ringing.
Mr Major will take a softer approach, partly because many of the problems
which exercised Mrs Thatcher have been resolved.
For example, Tokyo has opened its stock exchange and its telecommunications
market to foreign companies. The Hosokawa government has also embarked on a
deregulation drive that has strong parallels with the rhetoric emerging from
London.
But there has also been a change in UK government approach. Unlike the US,
London believes that, exerting pressure on an increasingly confident Japan
is the last way to strike a deal.
Instead, Mr Major hopes to build on the warm relationship between London and
Tokyo which has flowed from Japanese investment in Britain. Japan, which
directs 40 per cent of its European investment to Britain, increasingly sees
London as a reliable spokesman in a shifting an uncertain European
Community.
Mr Major, the latest in a queue of UK ministers to visit Tokyo this year,
will be seeking business opportunities for British companies, greater
science and technology links. He will also bring support for Japan's growing
role in world diplomacy. He will be accompanied by a business delegation of
senior executives from 11 companies, plus Mr Howard Davies, director general
of the Confederation of British Industry and Mr Richard Needham, the trade
minister.
That looks hefty, but it is deliberately lightweight by comparison with the
delegation that accompanied then US President George Bush to Tokyo last
year, which was widely criticised as clumsy.
The companies will have their own shopping list. They include Rolls-Royce,
Unilever, Guinness, ICI, British Telecom, British Gas, General Electric,
Cable and Wireless, and Amec. Rolls Royce, for example, is keen to sell jet
engines to Japan Air Lines, which is expected to pick a supplier to refit
much of its fleet in November. ICI is hoping to expand a joint venture with
Teijin, a Japanese gases group, for making alternatives to
chlorofluorocarbons, while GEC is looking for opportunities in government
procurement.
Officials emphasise that Mr Major is not just on a selling mission. Like the
US, Britain remains concerned over its growing bilateral trade deficit with
Japan, which amounted to Pounds 5.2bn last year.
But unlike the US, Britain will not push for a numerically targeted cut in
the deficit.
Instead, Mr Major is expected to press for a multilateral freeing up of
Japanese trade, notably by insisting that any concessions granted to the US
should also apply to other trade partners.
The UK is also worried that Japan is under such pressure to make concessions
to Washington that British companies might lose contracts to US competitors
for purely political reasons. Specific items on the agenda include sales
taxes on imported whisky, which is many times higher than on domestic
drinks, and continuing barriers to foreign lawyers.
None of this is likely to cause serious problems. But there may be some
sharp exchanges about Japanese reluctance to open the rice market to foreign
suppliers.
Mr Major, who is said by officials to be 'obsessed' by the stalled Uruguay
Round of the Gatt, will press hard for movement on an issue he believes may
prove crucial to the objective of achieving a more open world trading
system.
Mr Major will spend two days in Kuala Lumpur on the way home, mainly in the
hope of strengthening relations with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the sometimes
prickly prime minister, and boosting opportunities for British companies in
the dynamic Malaysian economy.
The British premier is bracing himself for a lecture from Dr Mohamad on the
European Community's reluctance to intervene militarily in Bosnia in support
of the Moslem population.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: Lower fuel bills and a wider choice
of beers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER bills for gas and electricity, more tree-lined streets and a greater
variety of beers are some of the changes the Japanese public is being
promised in the latest economic stimulus package to be implemented by Japan.
'The worst thing is to do it in little bits like this,' said Mr Takuma
Yamamoto, chairman of Fujitsu, the computer and telecommunications group. Mr
Yamamoto argued that the package should have been adopted earlier and that
the amount being considered was far short of necessary. 'We need at least
Y10,000bn (Pounds 61bn),' he said.
The government's aim in the latest set of measures was mainly to focus on
improving the quality of life of ordinary people by enabling them to better
enjoy the fruits of Japan's economic success, according to its drafters.
But the package failed to deliver the one change which is widely expected to
be the most effective in stimulating consumer demand and revitalising
Japan's flagging economy: a cut in income taxes.
Instead, Mr Hosokawa has allowed the Finance Ministry to retain the option
of combining a cut in income taxes with an increase in Japan's 3 per cent
consumption tax to make up for the lost revenue.
The package focused on efforts to deregulate Japanese industries, pass on
the benefits of the yen to consumers and improve the country's social
infrastructure 'from the viewpoint of ordinary people and consumers'
interests,' according to the government.
Among 94 areas to be deregulated are the easing of rules for beer
production, the liberalisation of mobile phone sales and a change in
Japanese rules governing the standards for food shelf-life and building
materials.
The first is expected to stimulate local economies by encouraging small
brewers to produce their own beers in competition with big producers, while
the shift from the leasing of mobile phones to direct sales is likely to
trigger greater competition in the market, particularly if it is accompanied
by deregulation of mobile phone tariffs.
Measures designed to pass on the benefits of the strong yen to consumers
include a reduction in electricity and gas charges and the expansion of
discount services for family air trips in Japan. The lower utility rates,
however, are probably too modest to do much to redirect spending to other
areas.
The measures are intended to enable Japanese consumers to enjoy the greater
international purchasing power they should in theory have as a result of the
strength of the yen against the US dollar. The Economic Planning Agency
estimates that if the benefits of a Y10 rise in the yen's value against the
dollar are fully passed on to consumers, it would result in a cut in
consumer prices of 1 per cent.
The third pillar of the package focuses on coping with the weak domestic
economy and Y1,000bn worth of measures to improve a social infrastructure.
More government money will aid small companies suffering under the prolonged
slowdown, and to stimulate interest in home building by increasing the
amount of low-interest government loans.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: Sharp rise against dollar in Europe
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN rose sharply against the dollar in European trading yesterday, as
currency dealers took the view that the Japanese economic package would do
little to reduce Tokyo's trade surplus.
Officials in Washington are keen to see a reduction in Japan's exports to
the US and, for most of this year, have adopted a policy of benign neglect
as the dollar has depreciated against the Japanese currency. By allowing the
yen to rise, the US has helped hold back Japanese exports.
Four weeks ago, the US Federal Reserve signalled a dramatic change in the
Clinton administration's stance on the dollar/yen exchange rate. The US
central bank halted the yen's appreciation (it was up by a fifth since the
start of the year) by intervening in foreign exchange markets and selling
the Japanese currency.
Since then, dealers have been led to believe Tokyo would introduce a strong
stimulus to the economy this week that would suck in imports.
But although the headline figure for yesterday's boost was larger than
expected, currency analysts were disappointed by the absence of tax cuts and
a reduction in the official discount rate.
After trading at around Y106.50 before the measures were introduced, the yen
appreciated sharply, broke through the Y105 barrier and was trading at
around Y104.55 last night. Several analysts suggested the yen could have
advanced considerably closer to the Y100 level, had it not been for fears
that the Federal Reserve might again intervene. 'It would be fair to say
that Y100 is on the cards now,' said Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ
International in London.

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Battle for hearts and minds over Nafta -
Guerrilla tactics versus White House pomp and press machine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUERRILLA tactics by Greenpeace were swamped by the White House pomp in
which Mr Clinton and three past US presidents this week endorsed the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
But the environmental activists, who momentarily disrupted a House hearing
to unfurl a 15 foot anti-Nafta banner, saw their stunt repeated again and
again on evening news shows.
With dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots
organisations have succeed in fanning anti-Nafta sentiment into widespread
public hostility against the pact with Canada and Mexico. A new Wall Street
Journal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highest
level yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of Nafta.
The continued economic sluggishness and the drumbeat of corporate layoff
announcements have hurt the pact's chances and presented the administration
with a formidable challenge. Fifty per cent of the Americans polled
disagreed with the administration's argument that more jobs will be created
than lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so that
US companies and workers could compete with Mexico.
Pro-Nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the
opposition's success in framing the debate against Nafta as a pact which
would cost jobs.
But they took heart from Tuesday's presidential show: President Clinton's
passionate insistence that the realities of the global marketplace be faced;
President Carter's attack on Mr Ross Perot, the populist billionaire, as a
demagogue with 'unlimited financial resources,'; President Bush's praise of
Mexican President Carlos Salinas; President Ford's warning that the country
would be overrun by impoverished immigrants from the South if they are given
no work at home.
'It was a revival,' said Texas Congressman JJ Pickle. 'I think Nafta was
born again.'
To keep the pro-Nafta case before the public, President Clinton Wednesday
took off for New Orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out
on speaking tours across the country. Government agencies have been
mobilised for the battle, given pro-Nafta literature and instructed to boost
the pact in seminars and public forums.
Congressional committees have begun to examine the details in preparation
for writing its implementing legislation, now expected on the Hill in
November. It is believed this process may satisfy some of the Congressional
doubters, who are demanding a 'level playing field' and a speedup of Mexican
tariff reductions.
Pro and anti-Nafta forces are keeping the fax lines burning. A Greenpeace
release warned that two decades of work on environmental protection would be
undermined if the pact is approved.
In response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental,
citizen and labour groups, Vice president Al Gore, Senator Max Baucus and
other lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the
largest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental
side pact, held a briefing to praise Nafta's environmental safeguards.
Seemingly unfazed by Nafta's new show of life, the Citizens Trade Campaign,
one of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to 'debunk'
the Clinton Administration claim Nafta would create 200,000 jobs in the next
five years.
Unmindful of a television camera, its leaders plotted new strategies:
anti-Nafta resolution in 25 state legislatures; a letter writing campaign
and more.
Notable by his absence from the fray has been Mr Richard Gephardt, the House
Majority Leader, who is said to be close to moving from tentative to
committed opposition. He will join forces with Congressman David Bonior, the
majority whip, and three of Mr Bonior's lieutenants, leaving the House
Speaker, Tom Foley, nearly alone on the defence, among the leadership.
'I do not think we have articulated well - the supporters of Nafta - the
very positive and energetic reasons that can be offered for supporting
this,' Mr Foley acknowledged.
Without Nafta, the US relationship with Mexico could 'deteriorate,' and
'much of what people are worried about will happen, perhaps more speedily
without Nafta than with it. Those things have to be presented more
forcefully.'

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's fight to gain Congressional approval for the North
American Free Trade Agreement yesterday reached Chicago, where Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, treasury secretary, addressed corporate executives, writes Laurie
Morse in Chicago.
The hundred or so mainly white and male chief executives who listened while
lunching in Continental Bank's private banking atrium were invited because
they were Nafta supporters.
Labour leaders, black politicians, and grassroots environmental organisers
who lead local opposition to the trade pact were absent, as were the ten
members of the Illinois Congressional delegation, all Democrats, who have
indicated opposition to Nafta.
Earlier in the day, the Congressional Black Caucus, which includes Chicago
Democrats, had released a position paper opposing Nafta, saying the minority
business community had never been fully consulted or considered on it.
The Illinois delegation embodies obstacles the Clinton administration must
overcome for Nafta to succeed. Of the state's 20 representatives, only nine
favour the agreement and only two are Democrats - yet Illinois exports to
Mexico have tripled, to Dollars 1.3bn, since 1987.
Mr Bentsen stressed Nafta's economic benefits to US manufactures and told
the luncheon that failure to confirm Nafta would entail political risks for
Mexico.

FORD Motor and the United Auto Workers union in the US yesterday announced
tentative agreement on a three-year labour contract.
This paves the way for what may be tense contract negotiations between the
union and troubled General Motors.
The UAW chose Ford as its first target in its contract negotiations with
each of the big three Detroit motor manufacturers this autumn.
The union will now try to impose the contract pattern reached with the
target company on the other two big motor manufacturers, Chrysler and GM.

THE charge that US monetary policy is too lax is likely to be taken
seriously at next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open
market committee, but the Fed may not yet be ready to raise short-term
interest rates.
In an interview in the New York Times, Mr David Mullins, the Fed
vice-chairman, referred to concerns that excessive growth of narrow measures
of the money supply was creating a bubble in share and bond prices. 'That's
one reason to be wary of being more accommodative,' he said.
Mr Mullins appeared to be responding to a recent report by the shadow open
market committee - a group of monetarist-leaning economists - arguing that
double-digit growth of the monetary base was artificially boosting prices of
financial assets and, if not checked, would lead to a resurgence of
inflation.
The federal funds rate is at its lowest level since the 1960s and has been
close to zero in inflation-adjusted terms for at least a year.
'Bank reserves have grown at a 12.5 per cent average rate in the past two
years,' says Mr Mickey Levy, chief economist at NationsBank in New York and
a member of the shadow open market committee. This has 'fuelled the demand
for financial assets, bidding up their prices.'
There has been some evidence of a divergence in the performance of the
financial and real economies. While share and bond prices have soared this
year, real gross domestic product grew only 1.3 per cent at an annual rate
in the first half.
Figures yesterday appeared consistent with a modest acceleration of growth
in the second half to an annual rate of 2.5-3.0 per cent. The Commerce
Department said industrial production rose 0.2 per cent last month and by
4.2 per cent in the year to August. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed
in July to Dollars 10.3bn, against Dollars 12.1bn in June, reflecting a
bigger fall in imports than of exports.
Many Wall Street economists are sceptical of the reasoning of the shadow
open market committee, saying the link between growth of the monetary base
(currency and bank reserves) and nominal income has been weak in the past.
Mr Will Brown, chief economist at J P Morgan the New York bank, said the
rise in prices of financial assets was merely a sign that a deliberatively
stimulative monetary policy was working. Talk of a bubble made little sense
because the valuation of assets was not yet out of line with economic
fundamentals.
Mr Brown and others conceded the shadow open market committee conclusions
were probably right. Monetary policy had been correct but it was now time to
consider raising rates. He predicted the Fed probably would raise short-term
rates from 3 to 3.5 per cent in the not too distant future.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Clinton consults about healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton (above) yesterday invited 21 of the 700,000 people
who have written to the White House to express their concerns about the
health care system to come to Washington to tell their stories, writes
George Graham.
The tales - of struggling to pay for a relative's care, of being unable to
change a job for fear of losing health insurance, of being charged Dollars
2,407 for a pair of crutches - are fuel to his fire.
Mr Clinton has set about putting his populist campaigning skills to the
service of governing, ahead of what is likely to be the most complex
challenge of his presidency, the reform of US health care.
Yesterday, the president tackled head-on the issue that is likely to become
one of the most controversial elements of his health reform plan  - the
requirement that all businesses must provide health insurance to their
employees, paying at least 80 per cent of the cost.
Mr Clinton said that employers who did not provide health insurance to their
workers were getting a 'free ride' by using a health care system paid for by
those who did. 'It seems to me that it is a fair thing to say everyone in
America should make some contribution to his or her own health insurance,
and all employers should make some contribution,' he added.

RUSSIA'S national machine tool association is seeking to strengthen its ties
with the west by joining Cecimo, the Brussels-based umbrella body for the
twelve main producing countries of western Europe, reports Andrew Baxter.
If Russia's application is accepted, it would be the first former communist
country to join Cecimo and would help Russia's 300 machine tool factories
develop co-operation agreements and joint ventures with western Europe.
The campaign to join is being led by Mr Nikolai Panichev, a former Soviet
minister for machine tools, who was recently chosen by the Russian producers
to be president of their privately owned national association.

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Treuhand looks east with expertise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREUHAND, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring east
German industry, will be giving itself a new lease of life when it winds up
its main operations in Berlin next year.
The Treuhand is expanding eastwards, in the former Soviet Union and the
Baltic states. 'We want to pass on our know-how and experience of
privatisation to these countries,' said Mr Klaus Muller, director of
Treuhand Osteuropa Beratungsgesellschaft (TOB), a consultancy arm of the
Treuhand.
TOB seems determined to compete, or co-operate, with other bodies -
including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the
European Investment Bank - active in eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
However, it may seem surprising that the Treuhand would be welcomed in these
countries. Its shock privatisation programme in eastern Germany has been
aimed at a radical restructuring of large enterprises resulting in massive
unemployment.
'The unemployment factor is not an issue. Officials from eastern Europe and
the Baltic states approached us in the first place,' said Mr Muller. 'They
reckoned with our experience of quickly breaking down the giant Kombinate
(east Germany's large enterprises), as well as preparing these plants for
privatisation; they could learn from us.'
With a small budget of DM30m (Pounds 12.1m) from the federal finance
ministry, to which it is answerable, TOB has set up in Berlin a small unit
of 40 specialists, and has already placed 70 consultants throughout eastern
Europe, the former Soviet Union and the Baltic states. It is the principal
advisor on privatisation to the Estonian government.
But, in a region inundated with advisors and consultants on privatisation
since the collapse of the Berlin Wall nearly three years ago, is there room
for TOB?
An Estonian diplomat has a clear view: 'Look, whatever the mess the eastern
German economy is in at the moment, we know that Germany will make it with
unification because they will try and develope a mittelstand (small and
medium-sized companies). We want TOB to teach us how to do that.'
Berliner Kraft und Licht, Berlin's main utility company, is set to gain a
foothold in Russia's electricity industry after an agreement to advise the
Russian Federation on restructuring its energy sector.
Over the next five years, Bewag, as the company is known, will advise
Mosenergo, the oldest and largest of Russia's utilities, on upgrading and
modernising its 22 power-generation plants which have a total capacity of
14,000MW.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Big debt means strong medicine for voters: Bernard Simon
finds a sombre mood among politicians in Canada's election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S unemployment rate is stuck above 11 per cent so it is hardly
surprising that job-creation is every politician's favourite issue in the
campaign for the October 25 general election.
What is surprising is that, in a country accustomed to a much government
molly-coddling, politicians on all sides are tempering their promises of new
jobs with a dose of fiscal restraint.
The first ten days of the campaign have shown that, for all their concern at
high unemployment, Canadians are aware of the constraints imposed by the
towering debt amassed by the federal government and the ten provinces over
the past two decades.
So, politicians are not only arguing about the type of jobs which should be
created for the 1990s, but also questioning the role of government in
creating them. Spreading the sombre message that Canadians should expect
less, rather than more, from their governments would have been a sure way to
lose votes in years gone by. But, this time, it seems to be doing the
opposite.
Both the ruling Progressive Conservatives and the opposition Liberals have
set specific targets for cutting the CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 18bn) federal
budget deficit. They have promised to overhaul the country's generous but
much-criticised social security and health care systems.
Ms Kim Campbell, the new prime minister, has vowed to eliminate the budget
deficit without tax increases by 1998. She has yet to spell out however, how
the pain would be spread.
Ms Campbell opened her campaign by cautioning that it might be several years
before there was an appreciable dent in the jobless rate. In Toronto last
week, she bluntly told unemployed construction workers that a Conservative
government would not subsidise a new convention centre for the city. She
said the jobs created by such make-work projects would last no more than a
year or two, and do nothing for long-term competitiveness.
Despite her sombre message, Ms Campbell has dramatically revived her party's
electoral fortunes.
The Tories had the support of only about one voter in five when Ms Campbell
took over, as premier and party leader, from her unpopular predecessor, Mr
Brian Mulroney, three months ago. However, according to an opinion poll in
the Globe and Mail newspaper yesterday, the Tories have edged ahead of the
opposition Liberals, with the support of 36 per cent of decided voters, the
Liberals having 33 per cent.
Next most popular, with 11 per cent, is the populist Reform Party, which has
been waging an even more aggressive crusade against big government from its
base in western Canada.
By contrast, the interventionist New Democratic Party faces the prospect of
losing more than half its 43 seats in the House of Commons. According to the
poll out yesterday, the NDP has only 8 per cent of the national vote, two
percentage points less than the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec.
In their policy platform, released this week, the Liberals were careful to
avoid extravagant claims of Ottawa's ability to spur economic growth.
The Liberal plan, which was described by party leader Mr Jean Chretien as
'realistic, compassionate and fiscally responsible', pledges a net reduction
in government programmes of CDollars 1.8bn over the next five years.
Provided the economy accelerates, the Liberals aim to reduce the budget
deficit from 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product to 3 per cent. They
promise to create 50,000 new child-care places a year - but only if the
economy has grown by at least 3 per cent in the previous year.
The Liberals aim to scrap the unpopular 7 per cent goods and services tax
(GST) imposed by the Tories in 1991, butthey acknowledge that it would be
necessary to find the equivalent revenues elsewhere.
It's a fair bet that at least some of the promises of fiscal restraint will
be forgotten once the election is over. The Tories have a miserable record
over the past nine years of sticking to their budget projections, and
economists doubt their ability bring the deficit down to zero by 1998.
Also, no-one would be surprised if the Liberals were to keep the GST, and
fail to meet their own deficit-cutting targets.
Even so, the emphasis on jobs and deficits means that, whichever party wins
the election, Canadians and their governments are likely to be pre-occupied
with domestic issues over the next few years. Many Canadians yearn for a
bigger role on the international stage but the new government will have its
hands full on the home front.

FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: EC misses out on Asian boom in investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN companies are missing opportunities in the global investment boom
in high-growth developing countries, according to a new report by the
European Round Table, a club of 40 top industrialists.
The report shows that the share of EC companies in foreign direct investment
in developing Asia, where the market is growing by 6.5 per cent annually,
slipped from about 15 per cent in the mid-1980s to 12 per cent by the end of
the decade.
In Latin America, which is expanding by 4 per cent a year, the EC share
dropped from 24 to 20 per cent over the same period. In Africa, with a
market a sixth the size of Asia's and growing at half the pace, the European
share has jumped from 17 to 40 per cent.
Japan is now the biggest foreign investor in developing countries, with a
third of total overseas investment of nearly Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.90bn)
last year.
By implanting their industry in fast-growing economies, the Japanese are
building a strategic competitive position.
The European Round Table - which includes the chief executives of such
companies as Nestle, Unilever and Daimler-Benz - argues that foreign direct
investment brings benefits to both sides. FDI accounts for just 3 per cent
of total investment in developing countries but it has, the report claims,
bigger effects on output, jobs and productivity.
Developing countries are increasingly competing for foreign direct
investment by deregulating and liberalising their economies, the report
says, though it urges further moves in this direction.
The round table adds its voice to calls for a Gatt for investment, a global
agreement that would provide for transparency (clear rules and procedures),
for rights of establishment by foreign companies and for parity of treatment
with domestic companies (national treatment, in Gatt parlance).
Industrialists also favour rules binding on international corporations - for
example, in policy conflicts between home and host governments.

ITALIAN exports to China this year are expected to nearly double and top
L4,000bn (Pounds 1.7bn), according to Mr Paolo Baratta, Italian trade
minister.
Seven contracts totalling Dollars 470m (Pounds 303m) were signed yesterday
with Italian companies.
The contracts were signed in the presence of Ms Wu Yi, Chinese foreign trade
minister, at the end of a visit to Italy.
The contracts ranged from Snamprogetti building a fertiliser plant at
Donfang in Haiwan province to Danieli constructing a specialised steel plant
for Laiwn Iron and Steel in Shandong province, financed by the Asian
Development Bank.
In the first seven months of this year, Italian exports to China reached
L1,238bn, compared to L1,842bn for the whole of 1992. Italy is now the
second largest European exporter to China after Germany.
Mr Baratta said Italy's share of Chinese exports was set to rise this year
from 2.1 per cent to nearly 3 per cent. Much of the Italian export drive is
concentrated in the machine tools and engineering goods sector, especially
textiles machinery.

The Cuban government has announced farm reforms to reduce state control over

In the Communist Party daily Granma, the government said it would set up co
 -operatives on state land and allowing farmers to share in their profits.
The co-operatives, to be set up for an indefinite period, would still sell
all their output to the state, but farmers would now split the profits among
themselves, handle their banking and buy their own materials on credit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORD Motor and the United Auto Workers union yesterday announced tentative
agreement on a three-year labour contract in the US, paving the way for what
may be tense contract negotiations between the union and troubled General
Motors.
The UAW chose Ford as its first target in its contract negotiations with
each of the big three Detroit motor manufacturers this autumn.
It will now try to impose the contract pattern reached with the target on
the other two car manufacturers, Chrysler and GM.
However, GM is struggling to stem losses in its US operations and has made
clear it will be seeking substantial labour cost cuts.
The Ford agreement was reached after negotiatins that ran almost 24 hours
after the expiry on Tuesday night of the old three-year contract.
Company and union officials will not provide details until the pact is
unveiled next Monday to local union leaders. However, it is believed to
provide that workers hired in future will receive lower starting wages for a
longer time, before reaching parity with veteran employees.

MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, narrowly escaped injury from
shells yesterday after rushing to Sukhumi, capital of the breakaway region
of Abkhazia, vowing to combat rebels with his bare hands, Reuter reports
from Tbilisi.
The rebels were fighting their way into the city after breaching a
seven-week ceasefire with Georgian troops in Abkhazia and launching a
surprise attack on the capital and the southern town of Ochamchira. Russia,
which brokered the peace deal and maintains troops in the former Soviet
republic, warned the rebel Abkhazian forces to withdraw immediately.
Georgian television said shells from Abkhazian forces hit a building where
Mr Shevardnadze was meeting Georgian soldiers. It said one man in the room
with him was injured.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, said he was
'extremely concerned' about the Abkhazian attacks. The peace process is
under the auspices of the UN.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Weak Ukraine plays into Russia's hands: Kiev's predicament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUMBLING about in an economic and political free fall which offers little
support for its 52m people, Ukraine still seeks, after two years of national
independence, to discover a settled national identity.
The population still tries to digest the shock of a decision - made a week
ago at a Russian-Ukrainian presidential meeting in the Crimean resort of
Massandra - to transfer the Black Sea Fleet from joint to wholly Russian
control, to lease the main naval port of Sevastopol, and to return the 176
strategic nuclear missiles to Russia.
The deal - which President Boris Yeltsin of Russia has presented as a fact
and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine has insisted is merely proposed -
would require, on Russia's part at least, the cancellation of Ukraine's
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.62bn) debt for oil and gas, and the delivery of fuel
for Ukraine's nuclear power stations. There would be also an agreed
procedure on use and control of the missiles.
There were scattered demonstrations: Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the
Rukh nationalist party, used the language of 'betrayal'. Yet, ridding itself
of an expensive and obsolescent fleet and base, and missiles which Ukraine
probably cannot fire and for which it has no doctrine determining at whom
they should be fired, is probably not a gut issue for most thoughtful
citizens. Larger matters, however, loom.
Next Tuesday, the Ukrainian parliament debates the Massandra accord and a
future economic union within the Commonwealth of Independent States. Next
Friday, Mr Kravchuk and his colleagues travel to Moscow to discuss just such
a union, which Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, yesterday
said would mean a centralisation of all monetary emission in the Russian
central bank for all members. Certainly, if it were to function at all, a
union would mean a subordination of many of the levers of economic policy to
a central, inevitably Russian-dominated, control.
On the experience of Massandra, Ukraine will be in poor shape to strike a
good deal. On his own admission, Mr Kravchuk was steamrollered into agreeing
whatever he did agree. Mr Boghdan Kravchenko, head of a leading economic and
training institute, said: 'The leadership has lost faith in its ability to
properly manage the country.'
No wonder. Official analysis of the economy for the first half of this year
describes a position which may be one of pre-collapse. Inflation hovers
around 50 per cent a month; production of most goods, including food,
continues to fall by 10-20 per cent; gross domestic product fell by 7 per
cent over the first half of 1992. A budget which had a relatively modest
deficit early this year has plunged in the last few months to one with a
deficit of 10-12 per cent of GDP. In reality, the official forecast of a
12.3 per cent deficit by the year-end may be doubled. Privatisation,
expected to bring in 650bn karbovantsi brought only 1.5bn - at today's
exchange rate, less than Pounds 78,000.
The helpless contemplation of this decline has brought to the front rank of
political life the representatives of the 'pro-union' approach in Ukraine -
a group whose present strength accounts for the 'swing to the east' which Mr
Kravchuk has evidently been taking. Its most prominent advocate in the
cabinet is Mr Valentin Landik, a 47-year-old company boss from the eastern
coal and steel city of Donetsk, now deputy prime minister in charge -
significantly - of relations with the CIS countries.
'I want there to be integration between the CIS states. I want an economic
union to be concluded. Why? Because the situation is getting worse. We can't
sell our goods in the west because of bad quality - and thus we should trade
our goods and co-operate with the east so we can go forward together,' Mr
Landik said in an interview.
But his conception of union is vague, reflecting both the lack of serious
preparation given to the issue and to the riven politics of the state. As he
admits, the parliament will debate the issue next Tuesday 'and God knows
what they will decide'.
He believes that 'without an economic union the sovereignty of Ukraine
cannot be safeguarded', reflecting the fears of industrialists that the
fraying links with Russia must be restored if collapse is to be averted.
Certainly, he sees a customs union as essential. He wants prices somehow to
be brought into line and he hints that the Ukrainian bargaining position
might be to try to secure an oil price of Dollars 50 a tonne, as against the
agreement now in force which prices Russian oil at Dollars 90 a tonne, with
full world prices next year. 'World prices for oil is death for us,' he
says.
There are two signs of hope. The two prominent reformers who served in, then
left government, Mr Viktor Pynzenyk and Mr Volodomyr Lanovoi, have either
created or are creating economic institutes to further their pro-market
ideas.
Privatisation, though meagre in its results, is still on the official agenda
and large companies - including Mr Landik's former company, Nord - are
transforming themselves into share companies.
As in Russia, the political stasis freezes everything. Everyone says
elections must come next spring at the latest: and while the socialist
grouping, representing the industrial interests of eastern Ukraine, may on
present showing secure the largest bloc of seats, groups like New Ukraine
and others are now seeking and getting the backing of the new commercial
interests to pursue market-oriented policies. A recent poll suggested more
than 50 per cent of the population still wanted to take the capitalist road.
The bottom line is statehood. 'The political elite is not going to surrender
that,' says Mr Kravchenko. 'People are sacrificing a great deal in the
present conditions, but there is still a willingness to stick it out to
preserve independence.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / Weak Ukraine plays into Russia's hands: Economic union means
giving Moscow control of many of the levers of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<TEXT>
TUMBLING about in an economic and political free fall which offers little
support for its 52m people, Ukraine still seeks, after two years of national
independence, to discover a settled national identity.
The country's politically active population still tries to digest the shock
of a decision - made a week ago at a Russian-Ukrainian presidential meeting
in the Crimean resort of Massandra - to transfer the Black Sea Fleet from
joint to wholly Russian control, to lease the main naval port of Sevastopol,
and to return the 176 strategic nuclear missiles to Russia.
The deal - which President Boris Yeltsin of Russia has presented as a fact
and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine has insisted is merely proposed -
would require, on Russia's part at least, the cancellation of Ukraine's
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.62bn) debt for oil and gas, and the delivery of fuel
for Ukraine's nuclear power stations. There would be also an agreed
procedure on the future use and control of the missiles.
There were scattered demonstrations: Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the
Rukh nationalist party, used the language of 'betrayal'. Yet, ridding itself
of an expensive and obsolescent fleet and base, and missiles which Ukraine
probably cannot fire and for which it has no doctrine determining at whom
they should be fired, is probably not a gut issue for most thoughtful
citizens. Larger matters, however, loom.
Next Tuesday, the Ukrainian parliament debates the Massandra accord and a
future economic union within the Commonwealth of Independent States. Next
Friday, Mr Kravchuk and his colleagues travel to Moscow to discuss just such
a union, which Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, yesterday
said would mean a centralisation of all monetary emission in the Russian
central bank for all members. Certainly, if it were to function at all, a
union would mean a subordination of many of the levers of economic policy to
a central, inevitably Russian-dominated, control.
On the experience of Massandra, Ukraine will be in poor shape to strike a
good deal. On his own admission, Mr Kravchuk was steamrollered into agreeing
whatever he did agree. Mr Boghdan Kravchenko, head of a leading economic and
training institute, said: 'The leadership has lost faith in its ability to
properly manage the country.'
No wonder. Official analysis of the economy for the first half of this year
describes a position which may be one of pre-collapse. Inflation hovers
around 50 per cent a month; production of most goods, including food,
continues to fall by 10-20 per cent; gross domestic product fell by 7 per
cent over the first half of 1992. A budget which had a relatively modest
deficit early this year has plunged in the last few months to one with a
deficit of 10-12 per cent of GDP. In reality, the official forecast of a
12.3 per cent deficit by the year-end may be doubled. Privatisation,
expected to bring in 650bn karbovantsi brought only 1.5bn - at today's
exchange rate, less than Pounds 78,000.
The helpless contemplation of this decline has brought to the front rank of
political life the representatives of the 'pro-union' approach in Ukraine -
a group whose present strength accounts for the 'swing to the east' which Mr
Kravchuk has evidently been taking. Its most prominent advocate in the
cabinet is Mr Valentin Landik, a 47-year-old company boss from the eastern
coal and steel city of Donetsk, now deputy prime minister in charge -
significantly - of relations with the CIS countries.
'I want there to be integration between the CIS states. I want an economic
union to be concluded. Why? Because the situation is getting worse. We can't
sell our goods in the west because of bad quality - and thus we should trade
our goods and co-operate with the east so we can go forward together,' Mr
Landik said in an interview.
But his conception of union is vague, reflecting both the lack of serious
preparation given to the issue and to the riven politics of the state. As he
admits, the parliament will debate the issue next Tuesday 'and God knows
what they will decide'. He believes that 'without an economic union the
sovereignty of Ukraine cannot be safeguarded', reflecting the fears of
industrialists that the fraying links with Russia must be restored if
collapse is to be averted. Certainly, he sees a customs union as essential.
He wants prices somehow to be brought into line and he hints that the
Ukrainian bargaining position might be to try to secure an oil price of
Dollars 50 a tonne, as against the agreement now in force which prices
Russian oil at Dollars 90 a tonne, with full world prices next year. 'World
prices for oil is death for us,' he says.
There are two signs of hope. The two prominent reformers who served in, then
left government, Mr Viktor Pynzenyk and Mr Volodomyr Lanovoi, have either
created or are creating economic institutes to further their pro-market
ideas.
Privatisation, though meagre in its results, is still on the official agenda
and large companies - including Mr Landik's former company, Nord - are
transforming themselves into share companies.
In agriculture, always regarded as Ukraine's wealth, only a few thousand
private farms have appeared. Mr Nigel Spooner, an adviser to the agriculture
minister, says the government is now working on plans to introduce
competition in the distributive part of the food chain, starting with
vegetable depots and the shops which they supply.
As for the state and collective farms, Mr Spooner believes they should
ultimately be privatised as large units, rather than be broken up.
As in Russia, the political stasis freezes everything. Everyone says
elections must come next spring at the latest: and while the socialist
grouping, representing the industrial interests of eastern Ukraine, may on
present showing secure the largest bloc of seats, groupings like New Ukraine
and others are now seeking and getting the backing of the new commercial
interests to pursue market-oriented policies. A recent poll suggested more
than 50 per cent of the population still wanted to take the capitalist road.
The bottom line is statehood. 'The political elite is not going to surrender
that,' says Mr Kravchenko. 'People are sacrificing a great deal in the
present conditions, but there is still a willingness to stick it out to
preserve independence.'
That such an eventuality should even be mooted shows the depth of the
Ukrainian crisis. But the best guess must still be that the Russian
leadership's renewed will to dominate is not so strong as to force the
issue, nor the Ukrainian leadership's loss of confidence so precipitous as
to put statehood on any conceivable bargaining table.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Bankruptcy law claims first victim: Demise of worthless
polluter sees break with communist economics

RUSSIAN commercial history was made when Cellulose Plant No. 2 in the
Archangel region was declared not worth saving because there was 'no demand
for its output and it pollutes the environment'.
This judgment by the local arbitration court made the state-owned plant the
first to go bust under a pioneering bankruptcy law passed in April.
In debt to the tune of Rbs36m, assets valued at Rbs31m were ordered shared
out among state-owned creditors ranging from the local power company,
Archenergo, to a local bread supplier.
In southern Russia, a private food supplier called Don-Chance, which was
owed Rbs2.46m for deliveries of sunflower oil, initiated bankruptcy
proceedings against a private company called Diaton in the town of Volodga,
whose shareholders included the local football team. Diaton, with total
debts of Rbs50m, was also put into liquidation.
More than a dozen cases processed so far from Archangel in the far north to
Sakhalin Island in the far east, show that the law, which is vital to market
reforms, is gradually being applied despite a host of obstacles to it. The
court records were made available to the Financial Times yesterday.
The biggest impediment to its widespread use is a dearth of qualified
judges, managers and auditors to handle bankruptcy proceedings seven decades
after capitalism was stamped out by the Bolshevik revolution.
In communist times, when money was cheap and everything was state-owned,
debts did not matter. Even after market reforms were launched in January
last year, many companies continued to supply each other with goods without
demanding payment.
Partly as a result of tighter financial discipline being imposed by the
government, that practice is now beginning to change, with many of the
plaintiffs featuring power companies.
But when Irkusktenergo in Siberia initiated bankruptcy proceedings against
the Bratsk timber company for not paying its bills, the judge fined the
plaintiff after an auditors check found the timber company had plenty of
money to pay its debts. The judge said the power company should have gone to
court to recover debts instead of initiating bankruptcy proceedings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S outgoing government is passing on to its as yet unknown successor a
better managed, more prosperous and more secure country than it inherited
only 14 months ago, Ms Hanna Suchocka, the acting prime minister, declared
yesterday.
But, in her valedictory message three days before Sunday's general
elections, she warned that any deviation from strict controls on government
spending or slowing down of privatisation would jeopardise post-communist
Poland's gains. It would lead to higher inflation, slower growth and affect
Poland's prospects for full entry into the EC and Nato, she added.
Speaking the day before the last Russian soldier was due to leave Polish
soil, Ms Suchocka reminded Poles that four years ago the country was still
occupied by thousands of Soviet troops and on the edge of hyper-inflation.
Since then the framework of a market economy had been put in place. She
cited, among the achievements, the creation of an internally convertible
currency.
With polls showing strong gains for left-wing parties catering to those who
have gained least from a market democracy, Ms Suchocka singled out high
unemployment as the main problem.

THE Romanian foreign minister, Mr Teodor Melescanu, yesterday said he
believed differences with Hungary over a bilateral treaty could now be
solved and that 'real progress' had been made in talks with Mr Geza
Jeszenszky, his Hungarian counterpart.
Earlier Mr Jeszenszky, the first senior member of the Hungarian government
to make an official visit to Romania since 1990, said that, while he was
hopeful relations would improve, many bilateral problems remained. He said
treatment of the Hungarian minority in Romania was the most sensitive point.
Romania is home to 1.7m ethnic Hungarians, the majority of whom live in the
western province of Transylvania, which was ruled by Hungary until 1918.
Mr Jeszenszky said the two countries should put their differences behind
them. He said Romania's ethnic Hungarians had enriched the country and that
their aspirations were in no way dangerous to the national majority.
Romanian nationalist parties, who hold 13 per cent of seats in parliament,
have repeatedly accused the Hungarian minority of seeking the return of
Transylvania to Hungary.
Mr Jeszenszky said it was difficult to understand why there was opposition
to the reopening of a Hungarian consulate in the Transylvanian town of Cluj.

</DATELINE>

HOPES that Bosnian peace talks could be reconvened soon were bolstered
yesterday when the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, announced they had called the three warring parties to Sarajevo
next Tuesday 'to consider signing' an overall peace settlement.
The move follows a surprise accord with the Bosnian Serbs signed yesterday
by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, which appears to mark a further step
towards the break-up of the union of three ethnic mini-states proposed under
the peace agreement.
The accord, which was signed for the Bosnian Serbs by Mr Momcilo Krajisnik,
chairman of the Bosnian Serb assembly, provides for the three mini-states to
hold a referendum within two years of the union's establishment to decide
whether to remain part of Bosnia.
The Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat sides have made clear from the start of
the 18-month civil war their wish to link with their 'parent' states, and it
is expected that they would attempt to secede soon.
But, as a sign of the confusion that dogs the process, the principles of the
broader peace package drawn up during negotiations in Geneva in August,
which stipulate that the other two republics must agree if a republic wants
to secede, still apparently stand. Mr Izetbegovic finally refused to sign
this agreement because his demands for extra territory were not met.
One western diplomat in Geneva yesterday suggested that Mr Izetbegovic may
have agreed to the referendum proposal in the hope of softening Serb
resistance to further territorial concessions. Mr John Mills, the mediators'
spokesman, said yesterday's deal signalled the 'additional flexibility' the
mediators had sought before reconvening the peace talks, which broke up a
fortnight ago.
However, President Izetbegovic, returning to Sarajevo from Geneva, said
there had been no change in Moslem demands for a bigger share of the country
when it was partitioned.
Conference sources warned that a peace deal was not yet assured. It remains
unclear whether the Serbs or Croats have made any concessions to these
demands, which include extra land around the north-west Moslem Bihac region
and eastern enclaves, and access to the sea.
It is also clear that the eventual deal will be a legal minefield, with this
week's agreements superimposed on the August package of constitutional
principles, transitional arrangements and a still disputed map.
Other points in yesterday's agreement between the Bosnian government and
Bosnian Serbs include:
A proviso that in the event of a break-up of the union, which could not take
effect before the republics' boundaries were agreed, the Moslem republic
would inherit Bosnia's UN seat and take possession of assets vested in the
union.
A promise that both the Bosnian Moslem and Serb republic could have access
to the sea.
A call for an end to hostilities between the Bosnian Serb and Moslems
throughout Bosnia by Saturday noon, the release of detainees and unhindered
access for relief convoys.
On Tuesday, Mr Izetbegovic signed a similar ceasefire accord with Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman, which also sets out procedures for settling
boundary issues.
But in spite of the agreement, fighting between Moslem and Croat forces
continued to rage in Central Bosnia yesterday. The situation has been
inflamed by new Croat and Moslem offensives and reports that Moslems had
massacred 30 Croat civilians on Wednesday.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Ups and downs of bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR EC governments and central banks battling with foreign exchange market
turbulence, the increased integration of international capital markets is
both good and bad news.
The positive aspect of the lowering of barriers between different markets is
that governments have been turning to foreign investors to fund soaring
budget deficits.
The bad news is that the greatly expanded size of foreign bond market
holdings has been a significant factor behind currency unrest during the
past year.
The potential disruptiveness of capital flows on the Dollars 1,000bn a day
global foreign exchange market helps explain the sporadic calls for capital
controls since the July/August crisis in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, on Wednesday appeared to
raise the possibility of partially re-introducing controls. Since the EC
liberalised capital movements in 1990, much-expanded cross-border investment
purchases have increased the share of foreign holdings in many countries'
debt markets from 20 to 30 per cent.
However, these funds can move out as well as in. An important reason behind
upsets in the ERM has been international investors' off-loading weaker
currencies in order to cover their positions in these countries' bond
markets.
Many of these holdings represent relatively short-term speculative
investments, which can be quickly switched between different currencies.
Introducing controls on access to these markets could have a
counter-productive effect by spurring international investors to shun
currencies sealed off by capital barriers.
General scepticism about the wisdom of such proposals was yesterday summed
up by an official at the Danish National Bank.
Denmark has put up with considerable speculative attacks against the krone
during the past 12 months. But the official said: 'Because capital markets
are so integrated, our view is that capital controls are neither possible
nor desirable.'
Even after the forced widening of ERM fluctuation bands last month, worries
about the volatility of these holdings continue to cast a shadow over EC
monetary policies.
Fears that non-resident investors will dump bonds have been one of the
reasons preventing weaker currency countries from making rapid cuts in
interest rates. France, Belgium and Denmark have all moved only cautiously
to ease monetary policy since the end of July. They have avoided using the
extra leeway to drift down against the D-Mark within the wider bands.
Another reason for prudence is the need to rebuild foreign exchange reserves
depleted in July's unsuccessful defence of ERM parities. France, which spent
an estimated FFr330bn (Dollars 59bn) to defend the franc, still has negative
net currency reserves, according to figures published yesterday by the Bank
of France.
They show that the net deficit, which peaked at FFr176bn on August 5, was
FFr90bn on September 9, an improvement from FFr104bn the previous week.
Competition among EC countries to attract international savings into their
bond markets has so far benefited above all Germany.
According to Bundesbank figures, non-residents channelled a record net
DM257bn into German domestic bonds in the 12 months to end-June, of which
DM171bn went into public sector bonds.
The Bundesbank's desire to maintain the D-Mark's international
attractiveness has been a prime reason for its refusal to make faster cuts
in short-term interest rates.
This strategy appears to have paid off.
Massive foreign inflows, financing a large proportion of the public sector
deficit, have helped bring German bond market yields down to near post-war
lows.
Foreigners held 26 per cent of total outstanding German public sector debt
of DM1,350bn at the end of last year, against 21 per cent of the DM1,050bn
debt total at end-1990.
In France, foreign investors have also considerably stepped up their debt
holdings. According to estimates in Paris, non-resident holdings of French
government bonds of more than seven years maturity rose to FFr305bn (27 per
cent of total outstanding debt) in April this year from FFr137bn (17 per
cent) at end-1990.
Foreign holdings of short-term French debt of five year maturity or less
also rose strongly to FFr213bn (43 per cent of total) from FFr118bn (29 per
cent) at end-1990.
On the Belgian bond market, rattled by speculative assaults on the Belgian
franc, foreign investors are now interested mainly in selling short-term and
medium-term bonds, according to Brussels dealers. Some, however, are
reinvesting in longer-term debt instruments. Latest Belgian central bank
figures show foreign holdings of medium- and long-term bonds in May 1993
totalled BFr301bn (Dollars 8.8bn), 11 per cent of the total, compared with
BFr250bn, 17 per cent, in June 1992.
Some dealers believe foreigners' share of the market may now be below 10 per
cent.
There have been similar stories of large foreign involvement in other
countries' bond markets. In Denmark, foreign holdings accounted for 14 per
cent of outstanding debt at the end of last year, against 8 per cent at
end-1990.
In some recent government bond issues in the Netherlands, foreign investors
have accounted for up to 90 per cent of sales - particularly for long-dated
30-year paper.
Overall, foreign investors accounted for 24 per cent of the Netherlands'
total outstanding debt at the end of 1992, up from 16 per cent in 1987 and
23 per cent in 1990.
In the UK, which has attracted substantial inflows since the brightening of
Britain's economic prospects earlier this year, dealers estimate that
foreign investors have taken 20-40 per cent of government debt issues in
recent months. The overall foreign-held component of outstanding UK
government debt is now around 17 per cent.
The British monetary authorities, like their EC counterparts, know that
foreign inflows may appear like a symbol of strength - but they can also be
a source of vulnerability.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Balladur appeals on jobs: Calls for industry to minimise
workforce cuts

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDOUARD BALLADUR, the French prime minister, yesterday urged industry to
minimise job cuts and to avoid using redundancies as the 'easy solution' to
difficult economic conditions.
His appeal came the day after the announcement or confirmation of about
13,000 job cuts by French companies, described by the press as 'Black
Wednesday'.
The series of redundancies, principally affecting public sector groups,
represents a blow to the government's attempts to curb unemployment growth.
The unemployment rate, now at about 11.7 per cent, is expected to reach 12.5
per cent by the end of the year, according to Insee, the national statistics
office.
Mr Balladur expressed concern at growing redundancies in French industry and
said that 'a modern and human economy cannot have as its sole objective the
obstinate search for financial efficiency'. He said industry must also take
account of 'the social dimension' of employment decisions.
An official at the prime minister's office said Mr Balladur's comments were
directed mainly at public sector companies. But the prime minister also said
private companies should only cut jobs 'as a last resort'.
The single biggest announcement of job losses this week came from Air
France, the lossmaking state-owned airline. The company said its difficult
financial situation led to the decision to cut 4,000 jobs, which is almost
10 per cent of its workforce, by the end of next year.
Snecma, the state-owned maker of aircraft engines, announced it would cut
the equivalent of 775 full time jobs in 1994.
Bull, the computer group, confirmed an earlier decision to shed 6,000 jobs,
including 2,850 in France, by the end of next year, while Thomson-CSF, the
defence electronics group, confirmed that it plans for 1,700 job losses in
the same period.

FAITHFUL to his threat, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein dissolved his
tiny principality's 25-seat parliament, setting off the second general
election campaign this year.
The prince, the last reigning monarch in Europe with real power, left little
doubt that his ruling was aimed to discomfit the parliamentarians who had
earlier this week sacked Mr Markus Buchel, their prime minister in a vote of
confidence. 'In my view, this was no reason for confidence in him to be
withdrawn,' the prince said at a press conference yesterday in Vaduz.
Mr Buchel's own party, the conservative Progressive Citizens' party,
complained that he had become unco-operative with other members of the
government. They hoped to be able to replace him without having to face a
fresh election.
But the prince observed dryly that these complaints did not emerge until the
prime minister had chosen a member of the opposition party to become head of
the civil service. The elections are likely to be held on October 23.
This is the second time in less than a year that Hans-Adam has flexed his
princely muscles. Last October, he threatened to dissolve parliament unless
it followed his guidance in promoting Liechtenstein's membership in the
European Economic Area.

GREECE'S privatisation programme has ground to a halt ahead of next month's
election, amid fears that if the socialists come to power it will be
immediately abandoned.
The programme, which was expected to raise more than Dr400bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
by next spring, had started to pick up speed.
Despite fierce trade union resistence, legislation was passed during the
summer permitting the partial privatisation of OTE, the state
telecommunications monopoly, and the private operation of new power plants.
A senior Greek official said yesterday that it would be impossible to keep
the privatisation procedure alive during the election campaign.
'Potential bidders are not interested because of the uncertainty,' he said.
Senior privatisation officials have already submitted their resignations.
The sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE to an international telecoms
operator, due to go through at the end of the year, is now in doubt.
The socialist Pasok party, which is ahead in the opinion polls, has made
opposition to the sale an important election issue. The socialists are also
against private power generation for all but small-scale projects to develop
solar and wind energy resources.
The future of a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 970m) project to build a new airport
for Athens, awarded last month to a German consortium led by Hochtief, also
looks uncertain.
At the very least, the start of construction will be delayed because the
deal must be ratified by the incoming parliament.
However, the terms agreed by the government, which give the German partners
a majority shareholding in a new company set up to build and manage the
airport, would be subject to review if there was a change in government.
Socialist parliamentarians have already called for an investigation. They
claim that there is a lack of transparency in the deal.
Procedures for the sale of two state-owned oil refineries, which are high on
the government's list of priorities for disposal, have been frozen.
The bidding process for a series of casino licences, due to be awarded this
year, is also on hold.

<TEXT>
WITH two weeks to go before he steps down as president of the Bundesbank, Mr
Helmut Schlesinger yesterday painted a positive picture of the state of the
German economy and the impact of the controversial monetary policy pursued
by the German central bank over the past year.
Mr Schlesinger, who will chair his last meeting of the Bundesbank council
next Thursday before he is succeeded by Mr Hans Tietmeyer at the beginning
of next month, said he was sure that the low point of the German recession
had been reached following the small 0.5 per cent growth in western German
gross national product in the second quarter.
He predicted that pan-German gross domestic product for the year as whole
would drop by 1.5 per cent, comprising a 2 per cent fall in the west offset
by 6 to 7 per cent growth in the eastern Lander.
This was in line with internal Bundesbank assumptions which were made last
year when formulating monetary policy, he said.
Mr Schlesinger, a 69-year-old Bavarian, took over from Mr Karl Otto Pohl as
president in the summer of 1991 after nearly 40 years working at the German
central bank. The last year of his term has been highly controversial as
Germany's interest rate policy - starting with the decision to raise rates
last July - has prompted one crisis in European currency markets after
another.
He was in defiant, je ne regrette rien frame of mind yesterday, restating
his view that the currency turbulence of last September was caused by
governments treating the ERM as if it were a fixed-rate system, ignoring the
option to devalue. He said the recent widening of the bands in which ERM
currencies were allowed to fluctuate was not the end of the ERM.
He also reiterated the message which accompanied the Bundesbank's cut in
interest rates last week: that pressures leading to price rises were calming
down and that the rate of growth in money supply, a key determinant of
future inflation, was more subdued than in recent months when growth in
broad money or M3 has exceeded the central bank's target range.
'The position is not satisfactory but we are moving in the right direction,'
he said. 'Monetary conditions have to a large extent come back to normal.'
He said that long-term capital market interest rates were 'appropriate for
the recessionary environment', hinting that further cuts in short-term
interest rates are not to be expected soon.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Treuhand offers jobs to striking miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand, the east German privatisation agency, is to offer jobs to
hundreds of striking miners.
The miners have been on strike since April in protest at the Treuhand's
decision to close loss-making potash mines in the state of Thuringia.
Mr Werner Bayreuthner, a senior Treuhand official, said the agency was close
to reaching agreement with the government of Thuringia in which 380 jobs
would be created. The move represents a climbdown by the Treuhand and the
state of Thuringia, and could set a precedent for industries earmarked for
closure or substantial job cuts.
The miners have not yet responded to the proposal.
The compromise follows a decision by the Treuhand to merge east Germany's
Mitteldeutsche Kali and west Germany's Kali und Salz to reduce overcapacity
in the potash industry.
The merger entailed closing down the Bischoferode mine. However, the
Treuhand had agreed to preserve the 700 jobs for the two years. But miners
from the region opposed the merger and insisted that Bischoferode be kept
open.
Mr Bayreuthner said 200 jobs would be kept to maintain the closed mine,
retraining schemes would be offered to 80, and 100 jobs would be guaranteed
through companies investing in the region.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Charities attack Benetton: Poster campaign prompts Aids
furore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BENETTON, the Italian clothing company, came under fire from Aids welfare
organisations in Europe yesterday for the images used in its latest
advertising campaign, launched this week.
The French Association for the Fight against Aids said the photographs -
which depict a human bottom, a male arm and a lower abdomen each stamped
'HIV positive' in blue ink - evoked the Nazi practice of tattooing
concentration camp inmates.
It said it had filed a civil complaint against Benetton in the French
courts, demanding that it take down the posters and that it pay unspecified
damages.
The British charity Acet (Aids Care Education and Training) also demanded
the withdrawal of the adverts, which have appeared in double-page colour
spreads in UK newspapers and on the French metro system.
'The image of branding when it comes to HIV/Aids is one we have all worked
hard to get away from to reduce the stigma of Aids,' said Mr Maurice Adams,
executive director of Acet.
'I hope these offensive images will be withdrawn. If they consider this
working for charity, then this kind of help we can do without,' he added.
The Italian company is known as much for its shocking advertising as its
colourful knitwear.
The Terrence Higgins Trust, the leading British Aids charity, would not
comment on the photographs but welcomed the inclusion of the Aids national
helpline number in the adverts.
Benetton, which has used photos of a newly-born baby, a man in a Christ-like
pose moments before he died from Aids and a priest kissing a nun, defended
the campaign.
The adverts 'were metaphors for the more extensive branding practised
throughout society towards those who are different,' the company said in a
statement from its Italian headquarters.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Gaddum urges return to banking basics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'innovative' practice of financing capital investment with short-term
borrowings came under heavy fire yesterday from Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum,
the vice president-elect of the Bundesbank.
Urging a general return to more traditional methods, still predominant in
Germany, he said it was no accident that the Bundesbank's interest rates
policy found more support at home than in countries where investment was
suppressed by over-dependence on short-term rates.
'No-one should conclude that it is the central bank's job to correct this
inappropriate financing structure. The result should be reconsideration of
the rules for industrial and construction financing,' he told a bankers'
meeting in Bremen. Mr Gaddum, who takes office at the end of this month,
appeared to be drawing a new line of defence against criticism of the
Bundesbank's snail's-pace reduction in its short-term discount rate.
While there has been some domestic pressure from business for faster easing
of monetary policy in the past 18 months, it has been relatively muted. Some
80 per cent of all corporate lending in Germany is made at long-term rates.
Financial markets in all western countries had been flooded with so-called
innovative ways of packaging and guaranteeing financing in recent years, Mr
Gaddum said.
These had led people to ignore the traditional basic rules. 'For me these
include the rule that long-term investments must also be financed over the
long-term,' he said.
'Countries which have been more open to these innovations than Germany have
had to learn costly lessons.
'The money market, that is the market for short-term money, is and remains
the central banks' field of operations,' he said.
Banks which had freedom to manoeuvre with their short-term rate policy could
easily counter speculation which had no real economic grounds, he
maintained.
But if this room for action was limited then recent events - speculative
pressure on European currencies which led to the effective suspension of the
European exchange rate mechanism - could easily be repeated.
Mr Gaddum claimed that monetary policy could not be blamed for the
industrialised world's problems. Unemployment and public sector debt, which
rose from one economic cycle to the next, reflected structural economic and
social weaknesses.
'One cannot avoid the impression that the all too frequent attempts to blame
monetary policy for blocking recovery are attempts to divert attention from
inappropriate decisions on pay, social policy and state spending,' he said.
The Bundesbank, which has pressed vigorously for a rethink on these issues
within Germany, returned to the theme in its September monthly report,
published today.
Noting a considerable deterioration in public budgets, the report said the
total year-end deficit could be worse than expected. Including off-budget
borrowings by the post office, railways and the Treuhand privatisation
agency, it could reach DM230bn (Pounds 92bn), equivalent to 7.5 per cent of
gross domestic product.
The federal deficit in the second quarter, helped by the injection of the
central bank's 1992 profit of DM13bn, was only DM2.5bn. But this compared
with a surplus of DM10bn in the same period last year, including DM14.5bn in
Bundesbank profits.

THE Danish central bank yesterday cut its discount rate half a point to 8.75
per cent, AP-DJ reports from Copenhagen.
The krone remained steady at DKr4.11 to the D-Mark even after the rate cut.
'This cut in the discount rate is a visible signal to the rest of the world
that the central bank is willing to lower rates,' said a senior banker.
'But it is a cosmetic positive signal because it is the repo (repurchase)
rate which has more practical significance,' he added.
The central bank said the related folio (deposit) rate would be lowered with
immediate effect to 8.75 per cent.
According to the central bank the rate cuts are 'a step towards continuation
of the normalisation of interest rate levels'.
One Copenhagen broker forecast a repo rate cut next week.
Local analysts say that the rate cuts should have a neutral to good affect
on the krone.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Commission cools debate on controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday mounted a damage limitation exercise
following the call by Mr Jacques Delors for new rules to combat speculative
attacks on European currencies.
Amid fears that Mr Delors was advocating the reimposition of capital
controls, Brussels officials insisted that the Commission president's
comments to the European Parliament had been misinterpreted.
Mr Bruno Dethomas, chief spokesman, said: 'He was not calling for the
reintroduction of capital controls, he was merely calling for a debate.'
In his speech to MEPs in Strasbourg on Wednesday, Mr Delors likened currency
movements to traffic. 'Cars are free to drive but they are subject to
traffic rules. I see no reason why at international level we should not
study means of limiting monetary traffic.'
The European Commission usually avoids public comments on monetary matters
for fear of upsetting the currency markets. But Mr Delors' call for measures
to tighten controls on currency speculators has been echoed in recent weeks
by the French and Belgian governments whose currencies have suffered from
the upheaval in the European Monetary System.
An EC official said Mr Delors wanted to strengthen the European Monetary
System, possibly by 'changing the rules of the game' in foreign exchange
trading. One idea would be to restrict the ability of financial institutions
to take highly leveraged positions in the options and futures markets,
possibly by requiring a deposit to be lodged during the transaction.
'There is a feeling that the forex markets are operating under less strict
rules than, say, the commodity markets,' said one Brussels official. The
matter is now to be examined in an internal Commission study.
Another option raised by Mr Delors is to make use of the 'safeguard' clause
under Article 3 of the EC capital movement directive.
This allows a member state to impose protective measures for up to 180 days
to deal with adverse currency movements affecting their exchange rate and
monetary policies.
However, these emergency measures, which are subject to approval of the
European Commission and the opinions of the Community's monetary committee
and central bank governors, have never been formally invoked.
The temporary controls introduced last year by Ireland and Spain were
invoked under special transitional arrangements under the capital movement
directive, an EC official said.
On Wednesday, Mr Delors suggested that it was preferable if the Twelve acted
collectively to invoke safeguard measures rather than relying on individual
member states to defend their currencies.
This comment provoked much discussion within the Commission yesterday, with
legal and monetary experts debating the degree to which Article 73 of the
Maastricht treaty could sanction such collective action by qualified
majority vote.
The Delors speech suggests that the debate on how to rebuild and strengthen
the EMS as a vehicle for European monetary union has just begun.
Although the free-trading nations such as the UK, Germany and the
Netherlands are adamantly opposed to any hint of new capital controls, there
is wider support for tighter measures on the continent than might be
imagined.

FT  17 SEP 93 / VW halts Pounds 560m finance package for Skoda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN yesterday cancelled a complex DM1.4bn (Pounds 560m) investment
financing package for Skoda, its Czech subsidiary, hours before the deal was
due to be signed in London.
The move, which threatens to bring VW into conflict with international banks
and worsen strained relations with the government of the Czech Republic,
highlighted the intensity of the scramble to cut costs at the troubled
automotive group.
The package, negotiated with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation and a
private banking consortium led by Dresdner Bank, was no longer needed, VW
said.
The participating banks, were stunned by the last-minute decision. At a
dinner arranged by Dresdner Bank in London last night to celebrate the
signing, bankers were told by VW finance officials that the group's
investment plans were being drastically reconsidered in the light of its
parlous financial state.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, is believed to have telephoned Mr Vaclav
Klaus, the Czech prime minister, yesterday, to assure him that VW's
commitment to Skoda remained unaltered by the decision.
It was not clear if the VW supervisory board, which must usually be
consulted on important investment decisions, had been informed.
'It was an honest step, even though it was taken at short notice,' said Mr
Otto Ferdinand Wachs, a group spokesman. The company could have signed and
then cancelled it, he added.
He credited Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's controversial
production director, with improvements to manufacturing processes which had
helped make the loan unnecessary.
'This is a positive move which will improve profitability both at Skoda and
group level,' Mr Wachs added.
However, the group had previously signalled that it was seeking to
rationalise the number of basic car platforms on which the models of its
four makes - VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda - are based.
This rationalisation programme has now affected the group's plan to
introduce a second model range to Skoda in the late-1990s and to more than
double the production capacity of the Czech carmaker to more than 400,000
cars a year.
It was unclear to bankers at last night's dinner how VW now intended to
proceed with its investment plans at Skoda. Bankers were also unsure about
their general financial exposure to the group.
Under current plans VW was expecting to spend DM7bn at Skoda this decade. It
is understood that only around DM500m has been paid out so far this year.
The planned total has been cut to about DM4bn.
Interim results of an investment review, due to be considered by the
company's supervisory board in November, showed that productivity
improvements at Skoda meant investment requirements would be 'considerably
lower' than thought, the company said.
The VW statement said further cuts lay ahead for other parts of the group,
but Mr Wachs could offer no details, he said, because the review was
incomplete.
A similar review last January resulted in a DM7bn cut in medium-term
investment plans for the VW vehicles business. Spending for this year alone
was halved to around DM6bn, and other investments were postponed.
The cancellation is likely to cause more unease in the German government. It
has been disturbed by the threat of damage to the national reputation by the
storm surrounding Mr Piech and Mr Lopez, under investigation for several
months on suspicion of industrial espionage against General Motors of the
US.
Earlier this week VW was obliged to provide an emergency cash injection of
DM1.5bn for Seat, its Spanish subsidiary, after 'unexpectedly' discovering
that it was heading for a DM1.25bn loss this year.
The discovery has dashed all hopes of the group's reaching break-even this
year.

FT  17 SEP 93 / SIB to draw up City 'hit-list': Regulator prepares to ban
'unfit' individuals from investment business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
is preparing for the first time to ban individuals from the investment
business whose behaviour it believes poses a threat to investors.
In a move likely to alarm some parts of the investment industry, the SIB is
already reviewing several cases and considering bringing charges against
some individuals.
Separately, the Stock Exchange announced measures yesterday requiring
corporate directors to disclose all the terms of their remuneration,
including stock options and bonuses, in a move aimed also at increasing
protection for investors.
For the first time, companies will have to explain how much it will cost
shareholders if the director is dismissed before the contract's expiry date.
Existing rules offer a loophole by which directors can keep some of the most
expensive details private.
Huge payoffs to directors dismissed for incompetence have been a source of
dismay to institutional shareholders, who have been pressing for a greater
say in the terms of executives' contracts for the companies they invest in.
Although unrelated, the moves are aimed at two of the areas that have
attracted the greatest public and political criticism and might help to
deflect assertions that regulators have been lax in protecting investors
since the Financial Services Act was passed in 1986.
The SIB said its intention in banning individuals was 'not intended to
punish'. Instead, its goal will be to protect investors from future damage
and to deter others who might be considering similar activities.
It said: 'We are beginning to draw cases together. We have asked the
recognised bodies to nominate individuals and clearly we could have
individuals under consideration.'
Initially, the SIB intends to use its powers 'sparingly' until it can assess
the costs. 'The disqualification powers will generally be used by SIB to
focus on cases where, in SIB's opinion, there is serious unfitness which is
not being already appropriately addressed,' the SIB said.
Those who are the subject of a ban will have the opportunity to appeal to a
Treasury-appointed tribunal.
The SIB has had the power to ban individuals since its creation, but not
once in its six-year history has it ever considered doing so.
The decision to begin banning individuals stems from a review of the SIB's
authority conducted this year by its chairman, Mr Andrew Large, in which he
considered whether new legislation was needed to protect investors. In
April, Mr Large said he did not believe legislation was necessary but said
the SIB needed to use more fully the powers it did have.
The SIB said: 'In assessing unfitness, SIB will pay attention to an
individual's conduct in relation to SIB's principles and to the risk of
recurrence of misconduct. Evidence about past misconduct and of signs of
persistence, wilfulness, recklessness or negligence, following from that
will be relevant.'

FT  17 SEP 93 / Lamont backs PM after attacking policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, last night declared his support for
Mr John Major, the prime minister, a day after delivering a wide-ranging
attack on government policy.
'John Major will have my support,' Mr Lamont said. 'The Conservative party
does not want a leadership election, and there will be no leadership
election.
Mr Lamont's declaration, delivered on BBC television, followed a day of
mounting criticism of his attack on the prime minister from former cabinet
colleagues.
However, rightwing backbenchers said uncertainty about Mr Major's hold on
Downing Street would continue until after the Conservative party conference
next month.
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, said Mr Lamont had given a public
airing to views held privately by ministers who were unable to speak out. He
said the conference would be 'very difficult'.
Mr Major dismissed Mr Lamont's criticism, in two newspaper articles
published yesterday, as 'sad and disingenuous'. He said speculation about a
leadership challenge was 'silly'.
The prime minister's response was echoed by cabinet colleagues. The
strongest reaction came from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, who said
the sight of 'ex-ministers rewriting history' was 'sickening'.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, claimed Mr Lamont's comments had been
ignored by regional officials attending a morale-boosting meeting in
Cardiff. 'The issue which has been raised with me is that of loyalty to John
Major, support of John Major as prime minister,' he said. 'There is no
question whatsoever about that.'
Significantly, rightwing ministers also spoke out in support of Mr Major. Mr
Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said much of the debate was 'surreal'.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said it was 'sad that Norman does
think it necessary to continue to comment in this vein'.
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee, which represents all
Conservative backbenchers, said the 'vast majority' of Tory MPs supported Mr
Major. However, in a comment which reflected the unease in the party, Sir
Marcus said it appeared that 'Norman Lamont is going to be a loose cannon on
the back benches'.
In his appearance on BBC's Question Time, Mr Lamont said he would like to
return to the cabinet, but ruled himself out as a leadership candidate. He
also repeated his challenge to the prime minister to rule out British
participation in European monetary union.
Downing Street said this was an empty challenge because the prime minister
had already described the timetable for monetary union set out in the
Maastricht treaty as unsustainable.
Lord Jenkins, a founder of the Social Democrats, said on the programme he
found Mr Lamont's behaviour 'distasteful'. Mr Lamont 'was not up to the job'
as chancellor, he added.

FT  17 SEP 93 / Government to revoke export licences to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies exporting goods to Iraq which are exempt from the United
Nations trade embargo are to have their licences revoked by the government
following the discovery of fraudulent UN and Department of Trade and
Industry documents.
British officials at the UN have confirmed that UK registered companies are
among a number from various countries which have been brought to the
attention of the UN sanctions committee because of the alleged doctoring of
UN documents.
The doctoring involves false statements of export volumes on goods
classified as humanitarian aid, which may have resulted in some companies
breaching UN trade restrictions. UK officials say that they have been left
with no option but to revoke all export licences in order to prevent the
fraud from spreading.
The DTI is understood to be investigating at least one British-based company
after receiving information from US and UK intelligence.
Under the sanctions regime, which was imposed on Iraq after it invaded
Kuwait in August 1990, humanitarian aid includes medicines and baby food.
However, the fraud is believed to involve borderline cases, where the aid
could have a defence-related application, such as vehicle spare parts and
concrete. These cases are subject to UN scrutiny and require a UN letter of
authorisation.
At least 1,200 licences to export humanitarian-related goods have been
granted by the DTI to UK companies since sanctions were imposed. A further
270 supply licences, which allow UK companies to arrange for the supply of
humanitarian-related aid to Iraq through third countries, have been issued.
An estimated 300 of these licence applications have been approved by the UN
sanctions committee. Under existing procedures, a UK company wishing to
supply Iraq with humanitarian aid in borderline cases applies for an export
licence to the DTI, which applies to the UN sanctions committee for a letter
of authorisation. This letter, which details the company, the goods, and the
volumes involved, is sent back to the DTI via the Foreign Office.
According to senior Whitehall officials, goods which have been identified on
the forged documents are not military equipment. Nevertheless, the fraud
related to larger quantities of goods than those permitted under UN
restrictions.
The UK move follows a UN sanctions committee decision in the summer to set
an end of year expiry date on all approved export applications. The
applications previously had no time limit. However, some fraud cases have
involved the same licence being used more than once.
British companies will be told they can apply for new licences. But the
documentation will be on a different paper which officials say is less
susceptible to fraud.
The DTI, sensitive about not undermining UK commercial interests, was
planning to revoke the licencing procedures discretely, contacting companies
before making any kind of public announcement.
The DTI said yesterday it could neither confirm nor deny that it was about
to change its licensing procedures.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CALA in black after two years of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER TWO years in the red, a strong recovery in the second half enabled
CALA Group, the housebuilder, to report a pre-tax profit of Pounds 226,000
for the year to end-June.
Mr Geoffrey Ball, chairman, said the outcome - which compared with a deficit
of Pounds 980,000 last time - had been struck after write-downs totalling
Pounds 1.1m to reflect the fall in the value of housebuilding land and of
the group's remaining property interests.
Turnover was up by Pounds 3m to Pounds 69.2m and after a tax credit of of
Pounds 476,000, arising from the recovery of ACT written off last year,
earnings per share worked through at 1.98p (3.44p losses). As forecast,
there is a final dividend of 1.55p (1.15p) to maintain the total at 2.3p.
Net borrowings were reduced by Pounds 4.8m during the period and stood at
Pounds 11.1m at the year end, said Mr Ball, while significant progress had
been made in reducing overheads - down from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 7.1m over
the past three years.
The group's three housebuilding businesses sold a total of 676 units during
the year at an average price of Pounds 122,000 - compared with 604 units at
an average Pounds 114,000 last year.
However, the commercial property market had deteriorated further from its
already depressed state, Mr Ball said, and the group's programme of
disposals had been at a much slower pace than had been hoped.

FT  16 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Devro at Pounds 3.78m and sees
progress - Taking account of flotation pro forma figures show a rise of 32%
at mid-way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 17th September 1993) appended to this article.
DEVRO International, the maker of sausage casings made from the edible
protein collagen which came to the market in June, reported lower pre-tax
profits of Pounds 3.78m for the first half of 1993, against Pounds 5.89m.
However pro forma figures, calculated assuming the post flotation capital
structure had been in place during both periods showed pre-tax profits of
Pounds 12.1m, a 32 per cent improvement on the Pounds 9.1m of the comparable
period.
Reported interest payments were Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 4.53m) but fell to
Pounds 470,000 (Pounds 1.28m) in the pro forma figures.
The results for the Glasgow-based company showed sales growth of 18 per cent
to Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 39.2m). The sales growth was roughly in line with
the unaudited trading performance of 19.8 per cent for the first five months
stated in the flotation prospectus.
The pre-tax profit figures and trading margins impressed the market and the
shares closed up 6p at 232p.
Devro, which manufactures in the US and Australia as well as at its base,
was bought out of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US multinational by its management
for Pounds 108m in 1991. The flotation at 170p valued the company at Pounds
224m.
Mr Leon Allen, chairman, said trading had been strong despite the continuing
effects of recession in many markets. 'The group is in a strong financial
position, enabling us to continue to pursue our strategy of expanding
Devro's share of the collagen market.'
Mr Graeme Alexander, who has succeeded Mr Frank de Angeli as chief
executive, said that sales volumes in the period were up 7 per cent, with
sausage casings increasing by about 6 per cent. The UK showed a sales rise
of 6 per cent.
The company's new range of collagen film products, used in continental
Europe for wrapping smoked hams, rose by 90 per cent, though turnover is
only about Pounds 2m.
The rest of the profits increase was due to an 8 per cent foreign exchange
gain, mainly in North America and Japan, and a 3 per cent increase in the
price mix.
Profit margins rose from 26 to 27 per cent thanks, Mr Alexander said, to
controlling costs and gains in productivity. Research and development
spending was between Pounds 3m and Pounds 3.5m on in the six month period.
Devro expected its underlying tax rate for the period to be about 20 per
cent. This could rise progressively to 33 per cent in future years.
For the second half sales had started well and the company expected to
report further progress for the full year.
Reported earnings per share were 2.6p (3.4p). The pro forma figures were
6.4p (4.8p), a rise of 33 per cent.
CORRECTION
Devro International had pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.44m in the six months to
June. The figure was reported incorrectly in yesterday's edition.

AMNESTY International accuses Zaire's security forces today of appalling
human rights violations and urges the international community to intervene
before there is a complete breakdown of law and order, Reuter reports from
London.
Amnesty says in a report that Zaire is facing its worst human rights crisis
since the end of the civil war in the mid-1960s. It cites 'ruthless
brutality of government security forces . . . who have murdered or tortured
thousands of civilians and members of the peaceful political opposition'.
The report, 'Zaire: Violence against Democracy', calls on the international
community to devise ways to end the crisis.

CHAD'S President Idriss Deby has sacked his finance minister and accused Mr
Fidel Moungar, transitional prime minister, of acting irresponsibly, Reuter
reports from N'Djamena.
In a speech indicating a growing rift between the presidency and the
transitional government, Mr Deby said he had sacked Mr Robert Roygam as
finance minister and given his portfolio to Mr Abderamane Izzo Miskine,
currently trade and industry minister.
Mr Deby said Mr Moungar had 'permitted and even encouraged behaviour and
acts contrary to governmental etiquette' by Mr Roygam.
Mr Deby, who overthrew President Hissene Habre in 1990, has pledged to bring
democracy to Chad.

<TEXT>
AN EGYPTIAN military court sentenced two Moslem militants to hang and four
to life imprisonment yesterday for trying to assassinate an army general,
Reuter reports from Cairo.
The controversial military courts have now condemned 27 militants to death
since President Hosni Mubarak resorted to them last December to ensure swift
punishment for militants carrying out acts of violence aimed at toppling the
government.
Fifteen of the condemned men have been hanged, five are in custody and seven
are fugitives.
The two sentenced to death by a three-judge court in Cairo yesterday were
among eight accused of trying to kill army General Osman Shahin in an ambush
in Cairo on July 18.
The general escaped unhurt but six people, including a policeman and a
militant, were killed in a shootout.
The young men were members of the militant el-Gama'a el-Islamiya (Islamic
Group) which has claimed responsibility for many of the bomb attacks in
Egypt's worst political violence for a decade.
Egypt has been criticised by human rights groups in recent months for
carrying out its largest wave of executions for political crimes in decades.
At least 193 people have now been killed in political violence since March
last year and 510 injured. The Dollars 3bn tourism industry has been
devastated by militant attacks.

FT  16 SEP 93 / A lifebelt for Brazil's urban poor: The street economy is
worth Dollars 490bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALKING along the main commercial thoroughfare of Rio de Janeiro is a daily
battle. Pedestrians bump and curse along pavements packed with stalls
selling everything from sink plungers and hair grips to video games and
computer parts, which in the past three years have transformed the centre of
Rio into an enormous bazaar.
Much of what is sold looks like junk. But, according to the Inland Revenue
(RF), Brazilian streets are paved with gold. A recent RF study found that
the informal economy, including prostitution, drugs and illegal gambling,
moves around Dollars 490bn a year - more than the country's entire gross
domestic product.
A nationwide phenomenon, the underground economy is most visible in Rio,
which has up to 200,000 stalls (or camelos, as both stalls and stallholders
are known) and Sao Paulo, which has an estimated 160,000 - five times the
number of shops.
Mr Rodrigo Lopes, economic development secretary for Rio, says: 'It is a
phenomenon of urban sociology which happens in any big city but here is
intensified by misery, recession, lack of welfare and an excessive tax
system.'
Brazil has the world's biggest income gap between rich and poor, soaring
unemployment (Sao Paulo has 1.14m unemployed), a recession which has seen
per capita income drop 10 per cent in three years, and a complete absence of
any welfare system.
Sociologists struggling to explain the lack of social unrest in such a
country often seize upon the burgeoning informal economy. Mr Carlos Lessa,
professor at Rio's Federal University, says: 'It's a non-institutional
lifebelt that society has created to survive.'
Mr Marcio dos Santos, selling knives and scissors in his regular spot
directly outside a hardware shop on Rua Uruguaiana, is a former florist who
lost his job and needed a quick way to support his wife and four children.
Now earning Cr200,000 (Dollars 10) a day, he says: 'It's a much better
living than I got in the florist's. It's 100 per cent profit.'
But it is not always a question of survival. The camelo explosion has thrown
up entrepreneurs who run networks of 40 or more stalls, even supplying hot
meals to their salesmen. Their wares are often stolen goods or contraband,
smuggled high-tech items otherwise unobtainable because of Brazil's strict
import laws.
Despite its disorganised appearance the camelo business is rigidly
controlled, with formal representatives and each stallholder assigned his
own territory, for which, in some cases, rent must be paid. When
cash-starved local governments, frustrated by the sales tax slipping through
their fingers, periodically send in police and tax inspectors, the
stallholders often respond with gunfire.
Mr Cesar Maia, the new mayor of Rio, says: 'The problem is that urban
disorder has become structured and developed a new order.' Rejecting the
heavy-handed approach, his administration has developed a four-year strategy
working on three fronts. First it is making it easier to obtain licences,
allowing people to set up businesses in their homes, previously prohibited,
and giving tax exemption for small businesses.
At the same time the administration is working with police to locate and
seize clandestine deposits of merchandise. It is also moving into areas at
night and closing them off so camelos cannot come in. Instead, small markets
will be created for a limited number of licensed stalls.
By contrast, Sao Paulo has resorted to police action to force stallholders
off the streets.
In fact camelos are just a fraction of the informal economy. Mr Lessa
estimates that 40 per cent of the workforce of Rio is involved in
'non-regulated activities', whether transport, repairs, or running illegal
lotteries. Sao Paulo even has a fleet of 2,000 clandestine buses.
In the past two years more of the formal economy has stopped paying taxes,
partly because of recession but also because of the heavy burden and
complicated system.
So most businesses run a caixa dois (second cash register) or parallel
accounting system, and restaurants and shops rarely give proper receipts.
Many camelos belong to shops, selling their wares to avoid sales tax.
Mr Paulo Protasio, head of the Rio Chamber of Commerce, says: 'Camelos are
just the visible tip of the whole fiscal iceberg. If I pay a salary of
Dollars 200, the worker only receives Dollars 70 and the rest goes in taxes
and contributions. It is almost impossible to make money legally and we are
destroying the formal productive system.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Steel busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Active trading in British Steel saw turnover jump to 24m after UBS, its
broker, said it was a buyer of the stock. The shares bucked the poor market
trend, closing 4 up at 110p, after the securities house, which hosted a
dinner for the company on Tuesday evening, said its move was based on
optimism concerning the progress of discussions with the EC on its plans to
restructure the steel industry.
A trading statement from Allied-Lyons at a meeting of more than 100 brewing
analysts and institutions received a largely cool reception and the shares
dipped in average volume of 3.3m. An analyst said the cautious tone adopted
by Allied contrasted with a more bullish view espoused at its recent agm,
with the resulting decline in the shares.
Allied said the UK brewing market remained tough and that the recovery in
the US was sluggish. Dealers said the fall in the Allied shares, which
closed 18 down at 575p, was limited by yield support.
Mining conglomerate RTZ dropped 20 to 676p as two securities houses reduced
their forecasts for commodity prices and the company's profits.
Goldman Sachs cut its estimate on copper prices to an average of 80 cents a
pound for 1994, against a previous 85. A London spokesman for the US house
said the cut was based on an expected slowdown in world demand for copper.
Goldman estimated that a 10 per cent fall in copper prices could hit RTZ
earnings by Pounds 53m.
Meanwhile, Lehman Bro-thers downgraded its 1993 earnings forecast for RTZ.
Analyst Mr Rob Davies cut his estimate on the group's underlying full-year
earnings to 36.7p a share from 39p, and issued a profits forecast for the
year of 28.5p a share based on the new FRS3 accounting standard.
Stocks with heavy exposure to both London and New York suffered particularly
badly yesterday. Reuters stood out with a fall of 31 to 1549p in spite of a
positive seminar in New York. Shell Transport retreated 11 to 648p and
Rothmans International 'B' shares, already suffering from worries over their
Footsie status, fell 15 1/2 to 646p.
Realisation that the sector had been left behind, coupled with specific
factors, prompted early morning rallies in pharmaceuticals. But the gains
proved unsustainable and most leading pharmaceutical groups barely held
firm.
Glaxo was up 14 at best on US buying but closed a net penny off at 624p. The
US Food and Drug Administration failed to reach agreement on allowing
generic companies to make versions of off-patent inhaler treatments for
asthma. Agreement would have hit Glaxo's Ventolin and helped Medeva, which
has a potential rival to Ventolin. Medeva shed 9 to 106 1/2 p. SmithKline
Beecham 'A' closed flat at 409p after being up 9, and Wellcome retreated
from a high of 730p to 718p, a net fall of 6.
Profit-taking hit the regional electricity companies after a recent good
run, Panmure Gordon arguing that the Recs 'are at both their absolute and
relative all-time highs'. East Midland declined 8 to 529p, as did Yorkshire
to 576p.
Oil group Lasmo returned to profit and its shares rose 5 1/2 to 133 1/2 p.
Mr Simon Flowers of NatWest Securities said Lasmo had set aims six months
ago to cut costs, sell assets and refinance the balance sheet, and those
targets had been 'not just matched but exceeded'.
NatWest Securities was said to have been the big shopper for Tomkins shares,
which hardened 2 to 228p in trade of 5.3m following a positive if exacting
agm at the company.

FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Florida fears

<TEXT>
There was a Florida theme attached to the fortunes of a number of stocks
yesterday following the previous day's fallout from the murder of a British
tourist in the US state.
Rank Organisation chose yesterday to announce a multi-billion dollar
extension to its jointly owned Florida theme park. As well as worries that
the state's tourism would be badly hit in the long as well as the short term
by Tuesday's events, there were also rumblings of the need for a bumper
rights issue to fund the venture. Rank slid 21 to 773p in heavy trade of
1.9m.
Another casualty was Bass, which owns the Holiday Inn chain. Analysts said
the company received sizeable income from its hotels in the Florida region.
The stock was also hurt by Allied-Lyons' caution on the pace of US economic
recovery - as was Grand Metropolitan, off 13 at 418p. Bass finished 13 down
at 479p. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, on the other hand, firmed 3 to 483p on the
perceived benefits to its Centre Parcs holiday centres from a decline in
visitors to Florida. Hoare Govett was said to be positive on the stock.

FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Storehouse falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discouraging remarks from Storehouse over current trading saw stores
analysts trimming back their profits forecasts as the shares dropped back in
busy turnover of nearly 4m.
The market had been expecting sales growth at BHS and Mothercare to be 5 and
6 per cent respectively. However, the company put the figures at 4 and 5 per
cent which, together with warnings of a Pounds 6m provision, was enough to
prompt a raft of revisions. Storehouse finished 7 cheaper at 222p.
Storehouse's decline was seen as symptomatic of a day the stores sector
absorbed the mildly disappointing retail sales figures for August. Several
stocks weakened as a result as analysis of the figures showed footwear
suffering a reverse and clothing also experiencing a year-on-year decline.
Marks and Spencer fell 8 1/2 to 381p, Next rallied to close a net 2 off at
206 1/2 p on 3.4m traded, and Sears slipped 2 1/2 to 112 1/2 p. One of the
sector's few bright spots was Kingfisher, up 2 at 647p, which basked in
positive comments from Tuesday's results, and benefited also from some early
switching out of Storehouse.

FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: MGN speculation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers strengthened 8 to 186p after announcing a sharp rise
in first-half results to Pounds 69.9m from Pounds 15.3m. The results were
surrounded by speculation that the 54.8 per cent stake held by the group's
administrators - some 220m shares - would be placed yesterday.
Speculation was hotly denied, but several media analysts were being
unusually tight-lipped, leaving the strong impression that they had been
asked to place the shares and had been gagged ahead of the sale. NatWest
Securities, which published a large and bullish piece of research on MGN
only a month ago, was not responding to calls yesterday, and James Capel was
uncommunicative.
Senior traders believed that there was 'no smoke without fire' and that
brokers appointed by the administrator, Arthur Andersen, had been sounding
out possible buyers. Later the market latched on to the argument that the
stake would be placed at 160p a share after an extraordinary meeting of
shareholders on September 23.

FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forecast cuts hit Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of sharp profits downgrades hit British Aerospace, sending the
shares plunging after the company reported interim figures at the bottom end
of market expectations.
Profits came in at Pounds 20m, against a loss of Pounds 129m a year earlier,
but researchers had anticipated profits around Pounds 28m and a slightly
higher dividend payment. It was the higher than expected interest paid
figures, together with continuing losses at the company's turbo prop
operation, that really upset the market and led to the swingeing downgrades
from most securities houses.
Dealers rushed to sell the shares, which tumbled 31 to 389p at the day's
worst before a small rally late in the session saw them close 26 down at
394p, after heavy trading of nearly 10m.
Mr Chris Avery at Paribas Capital Markets reduced his full-year forecast by
Pounds 70m to Pounds 50m, while Mr Keith Hodgkinson at Lehman Brothers also
arrived at the same figure after lowering his previous estimate by Pounds
45m. However, both remain positive. NatWest Securities also reduced its
forecast by more than 50 per cent, going from Pounds 104m to Pounds 50m, but
said it was maintaining its 'long term positive stance'.
Ironically it was at the last set of interim figures that the share price of
BAe was more than halved after the company said it was to make a second-half
provision of Pounds 1bn.

FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heaviest setback for nearly a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISTURBING news on the progress of inflation and the domestic economy,
reflected in heavy falls in British government bond prices, hit the UK stock
market hard yesterday, bringing the largest daily fall on the FT-SE 100
Index for nearly 12 months and taking it well below the 3,000 mark captured
only at the beginning of last month.
The Footsie fell by 38.6 to 2,989.4, with only a 38.7 points fall in
February standing ahead of the 103.4 setback suffered on October 5 last year
when currency concerns began to circulate in Europe.
An unexpectedly large rise in the domestic August retail price index cast
doubts on the stock market's conviction that inflation has been beaten in
the UK.
However, the fall of around 1.3 per cent in the London equity market was
inside the bracket of losses on bourses in continental Europe. UK equity
strategists remained calm in the face of what was described as controlled
selling in the domestic market. Yesterday's fall in the London market was
regarded as a correction, rather than a sell-off.
'London performed relatively well against other markets,' commented Mr Ian
Harnett of Strauss Turnbull, although he added that the latest statistics on
domestic retail sales and the retail price index (RPI) were 'bad news for
equities'.
The RPI for August showed a year-on-year rise of 1.7 per cent, against
market predictions of plus 1.5 per cent, and gave a severe blow to stock
market optimism based on belief that domestic inflation has been conquered
and will remain under control. At the same time, an annualised rise of 3.3
per cent in August retail sales, contrasting with hopes for a 3.7 per cent
gain, challenged faith in the revival of the domestic economy.
Market strategists expressed particular concern over the heavy setback in
bond prices ahead of the impending auction of Pounds 3bn of UK government
bonds. The indication that domestic inflation may have returned to the
investment scene implied 'a whole new ball game', according to a leading
analyst.
The setback may cause the market professionals to take a fresh look at their
year-end forecasts for the Footsie which range from around 2,900 to 3,500,
with Nomura heading the list of bulls.
The confidence which took the FT-SE 100 to a trading peak of 3,115 at the
end of August has been progressively challenged over the past fortnight as
disappointing company results have unsettled a stock market already feeling
withdrawal symptoms as US investors appear to have switched attention to
other European securities markets.
Weakness in the US dollar, coupled with falls on Wall Street overnight, and
also in early trading in yesterday's session, brought setbacks in London's
blue chip stocks, which were also unsettled ahead of the expiry of the
Footsie future on Friday morning. Attempts to arbitrage between equities and
a September futures contract trading briefly at a discount were thwarted by
downward pressures on the underlying share prices.
Trading volume increased sharply to 741.8m shares from the 594.7m traded on
Tuesday, when retail, or customer, business worth Pounds 1.31bn indicated
significant profit-taking by the institutions.

FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR figures on UK inflation, combined with technical trading ahead of
tomorrow's expiry, brought a sharp retreat in the September Footsie futures
contract leaving it to trade at a discount to cash, writes Joel Kibazo.
The initial buying of the September contract faded after the release of
worse than expected figures on inflation. Dealers also took this as another
sign that a reduction in UK interest rates was unlikely in the near term.
Technical trading continued, although nervously, ahead of Friday's expiry in
both the futures and index traded options. But with the market continuing to
drift lower on a combination of the two factors, traders said that there was
little in the way of basket trading.
The premium was gently eroded following the inflation figures and at the
day's worst September traded at a 10-point discount to the underlying
market.
It closed at 2,986, a 2-point discount to cash with volume reaching a heavy
18,162 lots. The December contract traded 12,278 lots.
Volume in the traded options jumped to 55,490, with volume in the FT-SE 100
option which expires on Friday contributing 22,151 contracts. The Euro FT-SE
100 option added another 3,595 to the total and British Steel was the
busiest stock option at 3,580 lots. Amstrad recorded over 3,000 contracts.

FT  16 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow fluctuates with bonds to
end higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended a volatile trading session in positive territory
yesterday. After tracking the bond market lower in the morning, stocks
retraced their steps in the afternoon in the wake of a rally in bond prices,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which at mid-morning had been down 30
points, finished a net 17.89 up at 3,633.65. Other indices moved in a
similar fashion. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.70 at 461.60 and the
Nasdaq composite gained 6.91 at 739.55. NYSE volume was 298m shares.
For the second straight day, worries about inflation - sparked by an
unexpectedly strong August consumer price index figure - prompted heavy
early selling of Treasury bonds, which in turn sent stock prices lower. On
Tuesday the 30-year bond fell 1 1/2 points and the Dow declined 18.45.
Yesterday morning the 30-year bond dropped a further point, and the Dow
quickly weakened 30 points, sending the index below 3,600 for only the
second time in a month.
Analysts said investors were selling stocks and bonds not just because they
were worried about inflation, but also because the inflation data gave them
an excuse to take some of the profits earned in this summer's rally, and to
let out some of the pressure in stock and bond markets that have been
looking overbought in recent weeks.
By mid-afternoon, however, the selling pressure abated, and buyers returned
to the market, encouraged by an impressive rally in the bond market which
wiped out almost all of its early losses. The late recovery lifted the Dow
more than 20 points in the final hour of trading.
Walt Disney saw heavy trading and fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 39 in volume
of 5.2m shares after Wall Street securities house Goldman Sachs cut its
forecast for the entertainment group's 1993 fiscal year, warning that recent
violent attacks on tourists visiting Florida could hurt attendance at
Disneyworld.
Federal Express forged ahead Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 on stronger
than expected fiscal first-quarter profits of 60 cents a share.
Auto shares, which suffered earlier in the week on news of disappointing
weekly sales figures, rebounded. Ford rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 3/4 ,
General Motors Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 45 3/8 .
Schering-Plough climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 after investment
bank SG Warburg raised its rating on the stock from 'add' to 'buy', noting
that the company is in a better position relative to its competitors in
terms of currency exposure and its reliance upon drugs for the elderly.
On the Nasdaq market, the technology sector was firmer, Intel adding Dollars
1 5/8 at Dollars 64 7/8 and Microsoft Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 76 1/2 .
Canada
ANOTHER rally by gold shares helped the Toronto market pick up from earlier
weakness, the TSE 300 index, down 20 points at one stage, losing only 4.2 on
the day at 3,967.9. Falls led rises by 419 to 301 after volume of 74.4m
shares.
The golds index added 1.6 per cent as the New York bullion price rose
USDollars 2.75 an ounce.

FT  16 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak Dollars unsettles trading
in Continental centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar exerted its influence on bourses, while sporadic profit-taking
also contributed to weaker prices yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS retreated late in the day, with the CAC-40 index ending 55.63, or 2.6
per cent, down at 2,078.51 in turnover of some FFr4bn.
Mr Ian Furnivall, an analyst at the Paris office of Hoare Govett, commented
that while yesterday's decline was partly the result of profit-taking, there
was a general feeling that the French government was being unduly
intransigent in not easing monetary policy following the Bundesbank's recent
move. Another factor affecting sentiment, he said, was the recent bad set of
interim results, further emphasised by disappointing figures from Chargeurs
after the close of trading. He said that he would not be surprised if the
index fell below the 2,000 level in the next couple of weeks.
Among the day's declines Chargeurs lost FFr23 to FFr1,151 ahead of its
results, while Alcatel shed FFr16 to FFr723, BSN FFr28 to FFr883 and Elf
Aquitaine FFr15.40 to FFr395.90.
FRANKFURT saw nervous trading as the weaker dollar again affected overall
sentiment. The DAX index closed down 20.18 or 1 per cent at 1,860.39.
Turnover was DM5.4bn.
Some market observers noted that US institutional funds may have been moving
out of German stocks, but the underlying trend remained firm if cautious.
Mr Michael Geiger of NatWest Securities in London commented that the market
remained in a consolidation phase and he saw no reason to change any
recommendations at present.
Volkswagen was again in the news after reports earlier this week of expected
losses at its Spanish subsidiary. The shares lost DM11 or 3 per cent to
DM350.50.
Daimler fell DM12.70 or 1.8 per cent to DM708.80 ahead of tomorrow's
results.
Mr Geiger maintains a positive stance on construction stocks, particularly
Hochtief and Bilfinger and Berger which stand to gain if either Berlin or
Sydney are successful in winning the bid for the Olympic Games in 2,000 - a
decision is due next week - since both groups also have a strong exposure in
Australia. Hochtief yesterday shed DM14 to DM1,101 and Bilfinger DM1 to
DM910.
AMSTERDAM was another market to be affected by currency woes and the CBS
Tendency index closed down 2.8 or 2 per cent at 122.4, with most of the
losses occuring late in the session.
Analysts at Amsterdam brokers Pierson were not worried by the day's fall and
maintained that the market was showing a healthy correction from recent high
levels.
MILAN saw technical selling during the last hour wipe out some of the
earlier gains, leaving the Comit index 4.90 ahead at 611.04. The last day of
the monthly account had begun in positive mood with firm demand for insurers
and renewed US interest in the telecom sector.
However, Generali, which led the early gains following
Tuesday's disclosure that first half premium income was up 14 per cent on
the year slipped back to close L429 higher at L40,837, after a day's high of
L41,230.
Fiat fell L103 to L6,322, as rumours that the group might be planning a
rights issue refused to go away.
Sip, the domestic telephone operator gained L55 to L3,594 while Stet, the
holding company, finished L6 lower to L4,415.
Ferruzzi ended limit down for the fourth successive day. The share shed L37
or 10 per cent to L326.
ZURICH was hit as the dollar fell to a year's low against the Swiss franc
and the SMI index shed 26.5 or 1.1 per cent to 2,361.8.
The mood was also dampened by tomorrow's options and futures expiry which
was also expected to restrain activity today. Among exporters under
pressure, Nestle registered shares fell SFr21 to SFr1,041.
MADRID was pushed lower by profit taking as investors were unnerved by falls
in other European stock and bond futures markets and news that disagreements
were surfacing between trades union officials and the government in a new
round of social pact talks.
The general index shed 5.36 or 1.9 per cent to 283.30 in heavy turnover of
Pta21.5bn.
STOCKHOLM shed 1.7 per cent in response to sharply higher debt market
yields. The Affarsvarlden index fell 21.8 to 1,265.7.

FT  16 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Selling wave leaves
Taiwan at 7-month low
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF the Pacific Rim markets continued to display weakness in the absence
of Tokyo, which was closed for a public holiday.
TAIWAN closed at a seven-month low on a wave of late selling after the
weighted index broke below a support level of 3,800 points.
The index fell 44.4, or 1.2 per cent, to 3,782.10, its lowest finish since
the 3,775.19 recorded on February 12. Turnover, at TDollars 9.81bn, remained
very thin but exceeded the TDollars 9.34bn registered on Tuesday.
Sharp falls were seen in finance and electronic shares, sectors which had
declined relatively slowly during the market's correction in the past few
months.
AUSTRALIA continued its downward correction, dragged lower by a weaker Wall
Street, hectic futures trading and a heavy fall in News Corp. However, a
firmer golds sector, after bullion prices improved overnight, helped to
cushion falls in key stocks.
The All Ordinaries index finished 9.3 down at 1,903.6 in light turnover of
ADollars 422m.
A 42-cent drop in the recently strong News Corp to Dollars A10.16 helped to
drag the All Industrials index 18.3 lower to 3,002.4, while the All
Resources index shed 2.2 to 1,061.3.
Elsewhere in the media sector, Telecasters North Queensland jumped 20 cents
to Dollars A2.10 on the back of the Ten Group's rise in annual net profits,
announced on Tuesday, and its own pre-tax return to the black. TNQ is part
of a consortium which owns Ten Group.
The gold shares marker recovered 40.8 to 1,743.8 after suffering a setback
of about 180 points over the previous two days.
Plutonic advanced 20 cents to ADollars 6.20, while Placer Pacific and
Homestake each gained 10 cents at ADollars 2.60 and ADollars 1.48
respectively.
NEW ZEALAND declined for the fourth consecutive day, led down by forestry
issues, but brokers were unable to pinpoint specific reasons for the fall.
The NZSE-40 index lost 14.17 at 1,949.05, making a 50-point drop since last
Wednesday's close.
MANILA finished mixed, but some analysts believed it still looked set for
another climb, after Tuesday's profit-taking. The Manila index eased 2.24 to
1,952.16.
Manila Electric 'B' shares rose 5 pesos to 277.50 pesos and ABS-CBN, the
broadcaster, put on 1 peso at 62.50 pesos. PLDT slipped 20 pesos to 1,360
pesos following an overnight fall on Wall Street.
SEOUL suffered a day of lethargic and cautious trading, which left the
composite index 3.93 lower at 691.44.
Rumours that smaller companies might default on debt obligations also
sparked a sell-off in low-priced shares.
HONG KONG was firmer, although shares lost most of their morning gains on
profit-taking spurred by political and regulatory concerns. The Hang Seng
index finished 14.92 higher at 7,488.77. It was up 67.17 points earlier.
The market was unsettled by worries that attitudes were hardening in the
Sino-British talks in Beijing and by reports that the Commercial Crime
Bureau had raided a number of companies as part of an investigation of the
Allied Group.
Allied Group ended 9 cents down at HKDollars 1.02, Allied Properties lost 15
cents to HKDollars 1.40 and Allied Industries shed 10 cents to 81 cents.
Utilities led a blue-chip surge in the morning before falling back. China
Light closed 25 cents up at HKDollars 42 and HK Telecom gained 10 cents at
HKDollars 12.40. HSBC rose 50 cents to HKDollars 82 and Jardine Matheson
also 50 cents to HKDollars 14.92.
SINGAPORE was sent lower by profit-taking in highly speculative Malaysian
shares which have risen sharply recently. The Straits Times Industrial index
retreated 11.14 to 2,001.35.
BOMBAY relinquished its early gains on profit-taking and the BSE 30-share
index finished 7.16 lower at 2,800.48.

FT  16 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Athens dips after government resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resignation of the Greek government last week and the subsequent
decision to call an election for October 10 led to an immediate flight out
of equities in Athens.
The selling has since stabilised, but last Thursday's sharp decline saw the
market record the largest fall on the week, in dollar terms, among the
indices included in the IFC's table.
In spite of the decline, Carnegie International's Greek analysts remain
reasonably confident about the future direction of equities.
'The present consensus is that the index might move down as low as 750 (it
is currently moving in the 765 area) before consistent buying interest
returns,' they comment. 'The banking sector, however, is likely to remain
weak as questions are now being raised over whether the Commercial Bank's
outstanding rights issue will be fully taken up; while Credit Bank's capital
increase is once again hanging in the balance.'
The downtrend in Greece was the only negative factor in an otherwise strong
European region, with Turkey once more impressing investors with the week's
best gain.
Trading activity in Istanbul has been fuelled by a regulation approved last
month making mutual funds tradeable on the stock market. Schroder Securities
currently forecasts a continuation of the rally, with occasional dips for
profit-taking, and sees the index advancing to the 14,000 to 15,000 region
by the year-end, from the present 13,000 level.
Latin America's emerging markets were relatively subdued last week, with
only Brazil and, to a lesser extent, Argentina standing out.
Meanwhile, Mexico has been steadily losing ground over worries surrounding
the successful passage through the US congress of the North American Free
Trade Agreement. While President Bill Clinton has expressed his full support
for the agreement, and many observers expect it to come into force, as
planned, by January, certain doubts remain in some investors' minds.
Although Peru is not included among the IFC data, the equity market there
has, according to Latin American Securities in London, been the second best
performer in dollar terms this year to date after Brazil with a rise of some
90 per cent.
Latin American Securities says that one of the significant features of the
Peru stock market has been its improved liquidity this year, with some 20
companies having a trading frequency of 90 per cent, compared with just 10
at the end of 1992.
Among the Asian markets, Malaysia fell back throughout the week, although it
still shows a good performance over the year to date. In a recent review of
the market, Wardley James Capel forecasts that Malaysia will continue to
attract overseas funds, given the growth in second-quarter GDP (around 10
per cent) and the good interim results. Most analysts expect the bull run to
continue ahead of the October budget.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Falling bonds hit currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar and sterling fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday as
their respective bond markets suffered sudden and steep declines, writes
James Blitz.
Both of the currencies have been afflicted by the same problem in the last
two days. Unexpectedly high inflation figures have made dealers think that
short-term interest rates in the US and UK will go no lower, and may even
rise. This has lowered the attraction for investment at the 'long end' in UK
gilts and US Treasury bonds.
In the US, Tuesday's consumer price index showed a rise of 0.3 per cent in
August, against expectations of a 0.1 per cent increase. Yesterday, UK
figures showed a year-on-year rise for the retail price index in August of
1.7 per cent, against a 1.4 per cent increase in the year to July.
Expectations had been for an August figure of 1.5 per cent.
In time, the prospect of firmer rates in the UK and US may give the dollar
and sterling a boost because of the higher return on short-term investment.
But yesterday there was substantial selling in the gilts and US Treasury
markets and both currencies fell as dealers liquidated positions.
The dollar closed more than a pfennig down at DM1.5930 and the pound ended 1
1/4 pfennigs lower at DM2.4725. Sterling finished at Dollars 1.5515 from a
previous Dollars 1.5465.
The fall in US treasuries started a bandwagon effect in Europe. As dealers
sold dollars for D-Marks, the German currency appreciated against currencies
in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The French franc closed unchanged at FFr3.487 against the D-Mark, although
it had visited FFr3.4962 at one stage. The Belgian franc also depreciated on
the same day that the authorities in Belgium marginally cut interest rates.
In spite of some easing in French and Belgian monetary policy in recent
days, there were signs that dealers were becoming frustrated by the high
level of European rates. In spite of yesterday's cut in Belgian rates, some
Belgian franc interest rate futures contracts were unchanged and others
sharply depressed. The fall in French franc interest rate futures in recent
days is also a sign that the currency could court unpopularity with foreign
exchange dealers.
The Japanese yen traded erratically against the dollar as dealers waited for
news of the Japanese fiscal stimulus, due on Thursday in Asia.
At the start of trading, the yen was somewhat stronger, rising to a day's
high of Y105.53 to the dollar, amid indications that the fiscal package
could be in the order of 6 trillion yen rather than 5 trillion. But the yen
later lost ground, closing at Y106.25 from a previous Y105.80. Mr Jeremy
Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America, said dealers may have been
buying on the rumour of a big fiscal package and selling on the fact of it.
In New York the dollar ended at DM1.5967 and Y105.95.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING interest rate futures fell sharply yesterday following a
surprisingly large rise in the retail prices index in August, writes James
Blitz.
In the 12 months to August, the RPI increased by 1.7 per cent, from 1.4 per
cent in the year to July. The year-on-year figure for last month was the
highest since March, and raised speculation that UK base rates would not be
cut so quickly.
The revised expectations were most noticeable in the sterling interest rate
futures market, which effectively dis-missed any possibility of rates being
eased by the end of the year.
The December contract fell 10 basis points to close at 94.19 and the March
1994 contract also dropped 10 basis points, finishing at 94.28. Both of
these prices were compatible with rates remaining unchanged next year.
In the cash market, three-month money firmed to end at 5 31/32 per cent from
a previous 5 7/8 per cent.
Conditions in the German cash market were considerably easier yesterday
after the Bundesbank added substan-tially more liquidity in its weekly money
market operations than dealers had expected.
German call money has been at very high levels in recent days because
commercial banks were unwilling to borrow funds in last week's money market
operation, anticipating that a discount rate cut would bring cheaper money.
Yesterday, the central bank surprised dealers by adding a great deal more
liquidity than had been expected. A net DM24.4bn was injected, against
expectations of, at best, DM20bn. The Bundesbank only needed to accept 55
per cent of the bids made by the banks, such was the enthusiasm for funds.
Call money consequently fell sharply to close at around 6.75 per cent from a
previous 7.25 per cent.
The December Euromark contract was barely changed, declining 1 basis point
to close at 93.92.
French franc interest rates were a great deal more depressed, however, as
dealers continued to take the view that France would only lower its official
interest rates very slowly.
The December Pibor contract dropped 7 basis points to finish at 93.38, in
spite of a relatively robust performance by the French currency.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS proposes quota plan to stem
aluminium flood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALUMINIUM industry of the Commonwealth of Independent States has offered
to start a quota system to reduce output as a gesture to ease tensions
caused by exports to the west.
The offer was made by Mr Igor Prokopov, president of Concern Aluminiy, the
holding company for the CIS industry, at the first face-to-face meetings
with European Commission representatives in Brussels.
Mr Prokopov said Concern Aluminiy envisaged a voluntary production quota
system similar to the one attempted by the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, according to reports about the meeting by European
industry representatives.
There are some fears among European producers, however, that CIS aluminium
quotas might be as ineffective as those of Opec are proving to be at
present. One senior European executive suggested the system would not work
unless the CIS smelters actually shut down capacity.
There is also some doubt about the influence Concern Aluminiy could bring to
bear on individual smelters. Some reports suggest that two big Siberian
smelters - Krasnoyarsk (800,000 tonnes annual capacity) and Bratsk (850,000
tonnes) - have dropped out of the consortium. The two smelters' managers are
reported not to have attended the last meeting of Concern Aluminiy in June.
Nevertheless, this gesture by the CIS industry will be seen by some
observers as vindication of the highly criticised action by the European
Commission to restrict CIS aluminium imports to the EC until the end of
November. EC officials insist the restrictions were meant to be a political
gesture to bring the CIS industry to the negotiating table and were not
expected to have any impact on the total flow of aluminium from the CIS.
At the meetings with Concern Aluminiy last week EC officials stressed the
two-way nature of the talks. While they sought export restraint by the CIS
producers, they pointed out the EC industry was ready and willing to help in
the CIS with know-how, technology and even cash in certain circumstances.
Strains between the EC and the CIS industry developed after annual exports
to the west surged from 200,000 tonnes before 1990 to about 1m tonnes last
year. Traders at this week's annual Metal Bulletin aluminium conference in
Montreal made estimates of this year's CIS exports ranging from 1m to 2m
tonnes.
In the new spirit of growing glasnost between the EC and CIS industries, the
Europeans are going out of their way to convince the CIS producers that they
see them as equal partners in an industry no longer divided into 'east' and
'west'.
This means that calculations about what is needed to restore a supply/demand
balance to the aluminium market have had to be done again. As demand in the
CIS has dropped so steeply - Mr Horst Peters of VAW estimated at the
conference that in Russia alone it had slumped from 2.6m tonnes in 1988 to
1.8m tonnes last year - some observers now estimate that the combined
industry needs to shut down at least another 1m tonnes of annual capacity,
either permanently or until prices have recovered. Mr Louis Vincinguerra. a
general partner at Banque Rothschild in France, said at the MB conference
that 1.5m tonnes needed to go.
EC officials said that more meetings with the CIS aluminium producers were
planned before the end of September. 'It will be difficult, but we hope to
reach a formal agreement before the end of November,' one said.
Some in the EC industry suggest that, even if there was no full agreement by
then, now that the Commission has the full attention of the CIS producers.
there would be little purpose in continuing import restrictions.

PAKISTANI COTTON prices have slumped in the past two weeks amid signs of a
big crop after last year's poor harvest, Reuter reports from Karachi. High
domestic interest rates have exacerbated the situation by keeping buyers out
of the market, analysts say.
Prices for the 1993-94 (July-June) crop had fallen by nearly Rs200 (Pounds
4.40), or 17 per cent, since the season officially started on September 1,
said Mr Akbarali Hashwani, chairman of the private Karachi Cotton
Association.
He forecast a further drop in prices on the good crop. 'Quality is good and
quantity is large,' he said.
Mr Hashwani explained that the crop was doing well because of recent hot dry
weather in cotton-growing areas in the south and centre of the country.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: All systems 'go' for coffee
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE-producing countries meeting in Bogota have agreed on both the
retention scheme and the statutes for the new producers' association to be
launched next week in Brazil.
Mr Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian Coffee Growers' Federation,
stressed that producers were not forming a cartel but trying to ensure
organised supply.
Retention will begin on October 1 with each country holding back 20 bags of
coffee for every 100 bags exported. If the coffee price index stays at 75
cents a lb or more for 20 days, retention will drop to 10 per cent of
exports. If the price then reaches 80 cents a lb or more for 10 days there
will be no further retention until prices drop again.
All the coffee held back must come from the current harvest and an
international company will audit the scheme. Penalties will be applied to
those not keeping back the full amount -- for example, producers will have
to retain double any proven shortfall. The association's committee will
decide whether stocks are to be freed and when.
Observers at the meeting included several countries that will now probably
join the association. Ecuador has already decided to do so but Mexico said
it could give no definite answer as yet. Countries committed to the
association account for some 85 per cent of world coffee production.
The Bogota meeting was essentially a technical discussion in preparation for
the September 23 launch and Mr Cardenas called it 'a real success'. The
association aims to co-ordinate production and exports among as many
producers as possible and will also work to expand coffee consumption.
Mr Frederico Robalinho of the Brazilian trade ministry said the association
was very well prepared for next week's meeting and he was optimistic about
its future. Mr Andrade Vieira, Brazil's minister for industry, trade and
tourism, is to be the first executive president and the headquarters
provisionally being estabilished in Brasilia.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard hopeful that Argentina
will lift 'mad cow' ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and REUTER

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Gillian Shephard said she hoped for a rapid lifting of the ban on
imports of British cattle to Argentina after talks held during her recent
trade promotion trip to three South American countries.
Argentina remains one of 17 countries still banning British cattle for
breeding because of the outbreak of 'mad cow disease' in the 1980s.
Mrs Shephard who has left officials behind in Argentina to continue
negotiations on lifting of the ban, said some very real progress had been
made. 'Not that Argentinian beef needs improving - they have some of the
most magnificent animals in the world - but there is enormous enthusiasm for
freshening the stock and there will be opportunities for co-operation.'
The ban applies chiefly to frozen embryos and semen used for introducing new
strains to beef cattle.
Mrs Shephard said Argentina was also interested in improving techniques in
the pig industry and was keen to co-operate with UK experts.
Mr Eric Thain, executive director of the Scottish Agricultural College, who
accompanied Mrs Shephard on her trip, said he had agreed a deal to
co-operate with Argentina's technology institute on a wide range of farming
issues, including pig breeding. Mr Thain will also be helping the Argentines
with sustainable farming methods and vaccinations for foot and mouth
disease.
Mrs Shephard touched on the sensitive issue of fish stocks in the South
Atlantic during her trip, but she said the issue of sovereignity of the
Falkland Islands was not mentioned.
A two-week spell of dry weather in Argentina's farming belt could hurt
production of the 1993-94 wheat crop, traders have warned, Reuter reports
from Buenos Aires.
Stunted seedling growth in vast crop areas - caused by the recent lack of
rain and a previous 70-day drought - could inflict losses of up to 1m
tonnes, they added.
Seasonal wheat sowing was concluded in the past week, with farmers planting
a total 5.2m hectares.

more sugar

<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINE Sugar Regulatory Administration plans to sell more sugar on
the world market in 1993-94 to dispose of its huge stockpile, Reuter reports
from Manila.
About 500,000 tonnes will be exported this season against the previous crop
year's nearly 150,000 tonnes world market allocation, the SRA said. Total
sugar production is expected to reach 2m tonnes in 1993-94.
SRA administrator Mr Rodolfo Gamboa said the increased allocation was
because of a huge stock of sugar, amounting to some 400,000 tonnes, carried
over from 1992-93.
Some sugar exporters were not keen to sell abroad, however, because the
world price of 6 to 8 US cents a lb is much lower than the domestic cost of
production of about 13 cents a lb, Gamboa noted.
He said the large stock would not depress domestic prices because of delays
in milling for the last crop by one to two months to around November this
year. The delays were because of a drought that prevented early plantings
last year, he added.

Overmanning and inefficiency have been identified as the main reasons for

since 1972 because of the shrinking international market and low efficiency.
The minister said the government would create a revolving fund of Dollars
2.5m to offer mills loans at 3 per cent interest over 12 years. He added
that the government would ban production of polythene bags and other
synthetic products that posed a major threat to the jute market.
However, he gave no date for imposing the ban or for implementing the loan
plan.
Bangladesh, which is under pressure from the World Bank to sack excess
workers and sell loss-making jute mills, earns about Dollars 420m or nearly
17 per cent of its annual receipts from jute and jute goods.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: FAO official gloomy on price
outlook for tea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   COONOOR, INDIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD TEA prices are likely to soften over the next seven years because of a
projected surplus in output of black tea by the turn of the century, a
senior official of the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Coonoor, India.
Mr Gunther Wurdack, secretary of the Intergovernmental Group on Tea in the
FAO, said that despite the projected weakening in already depressed prices,
it was unlikely that this would translate into a significant increase in
consumption.
He told a commodities conference here that global production of black tea
was forecast at 2,638m kg in the year 2000, compared with projected demand
of 2,548m kg.
'The projected imbalance of supply outstripping demand would indicate that
already depressed prices could weaken further,' he said. 'This in turn could
force a number of growers to curtail production since already current prices
obtained by some teas do not cover costs.'
In a paper read at the centenary conference of the United Planters'
Association of Southern India, Mr Wurdack said this would not be in the
interests of the tea industry. He suggested it might induce both exporters
and importers to reconsider the idea of raising the quality of teas entering
the export market by implementing minimum quality standards. Quality
improvement would help bolster international prices by reducing supply, he
said.
The FAO is to hold an intergovernmental group meeting in Morocco next June
to discuss setting new international standards for the tea industry, Mr
Wurdack told conference delegates.
'Going for better quality teas is the right approach to take,' said Mr AK
Gosawmi, joint secretary in charge of plantations in India's commerce
ministry.
'There is not much elasticity in developed markets.'
The FAO forecasts that India, the world's largest producer of black teas,
will boost tea output to 966m kg, compared with a government target of 1bn
kg by the year 2000. It expects the next largest producers, Sri Lanka and
Kenya, to have outputs that year of 264m kg and 250m respectively. Mr
Wurdack suggested, however, that the Sri Lanka figure might prove to be be
too low.
UPASI forecasts that Indian production will reach a record 745m kg this
year, compared with 703m kg in 1992 and 743m kg in 1991.
World black tea import requirements are forecast by the FAO to reach 1,227m
kg in 2000, up from 963m in 1990.
Mr Wurdack said total export availability by the turn of the century would
be 1,325m kg, leaving a projected exportable surplus of 98m kg.
Several delegates at the conference objected to the FAO's predictions,
arguing that they were based on faulty data and would help add to the
depressed international prices.
UPASI forecast that prices might rise this year. Having averaged Rs39 (82p)
a kilogram at Indian auctions during the past four years, they could reach
an average of Rs48 in 1993, it said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool prices have been holding up very well in Australia this week, when
there were clearances of over 90% at Geelong and Newcastle. The season's
first large offering of superfine wools came on the market and attracted
strong competition, particularly for the choicest styles. The AWC market
indicator rose to 428 cents a kg, an increase of 10 cents in a week.
Business conditions in the UK and on the continent continue to be very quiet
and Bradford top quotations remain virtually unchanged.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reduction in world wool output
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD wool clip is expected to be 5 per cent lower in the 1993-94 crop
year (ending June 30) at 1.6m tonnes, according to the latest Wool
Statistics report by the International Wool Textile Organisation.
This represents a 20 per cent fall from the record set in 1989-1990 as
growers have turned away from wool to other crops in the face of depressed
world demand.
World producers' stocks remain high and total supplies are expected to
amount to 2.2m tonnes - 4 per cent below last year, but still excessive by
historical levels.
The wool organisation is looking for a pick-up in world demand as the
recession ends and points out that stocks are low in some consuming
countries, including the US. But with overall economic growth proceeding at
a slow rate it expects the scope for increased demand this year to be
limited.
China, which has been the world's largest wool consumer since 1991, could be
slowing its growth in demand. In the first half of 1993, China's raw wool
imports increased by 16 per cent to 95,908 tonnes but its output of wool
fabrics was 8 per cent lower than the same 1992 period, indicating that part
of its imports are being held as stock.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EBRD to advance Dollars 90m
loan for Russia's Polar Lights oil project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday signed a
Dollars 90m loan for Polar Lights, a joint venture between the US oil
company Conoco and Arkhanskgeologiya, a Russian state-owned company.
The loan is part of a Dollars 350m project involving another Dollars 60m
loan from the International Finance Corporation and Dollars 50m from the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation for the development of the Ardalin
oil field.
Conoco's investment will amount to at least Dollars 50m.
Mr Billy Branch, Conoco's representative in Moscow, said the partners had
'some confidence' that an exemption granted to them from some oil export
taxation would still be respected by the time production began. Peak
production is expected to be around 26,000 barrels a day during the 20 year
life of the project.
The EBRD loan carries a maturity of nine years and a grace period of three
years during which nothing will have to be paid. Western loans will be
repaid via Russia's state-owned Moscow Narodny Bank in London out of the
proceeds from oil exports.
The EBRD, anxious to demonstrate effective lending to eastern Europe
following the furore over the spending on its headquarters in London, says
it hopes to grant around Dollars 400m in loans to the Russian oil sector
this year. This would include a Dollars 60m loan its board approved recently
for Nizhnevartovskneftegas, Russia's biggest state-owned oil company, for a
project not involving a foreign oil company.

The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market submitted to a minor correction
yesterday, easing further in the afternoon as the market seemed reconciled
to let the profit-takers return, albeit temporarily, to the driving seat.
The December futures price closed at Pounds 862 a tonne, down Pounds 18 on
the day and Pounds 28 below this week's peak. 'We've been seeing this for
some time - the market rises sharply, drops back about Pounds 25, but then
picks itself up again,' one dealer said. COFFEE futures had also been
showing substantial losses but recovered towards the close as traders
anticipated positive statements from members attending talks on technical
aspects of the retention scheme in Bogota. At the London Metal Exchange
COPPER prices ended firmer and near the day's highs as the market staged a
technical rally to yesterday's declines against a background of a renewed
widening in the cash premium. NICKEL prices were pushed lower during the
morning by European merchant selling and stop-loss sales, although levels
below Dollars 4,500 eventually attracted covering and trade interest, and
the market ended at Dollars 4,515, down Dollars 15.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: UK and US inflation data prompt wave of
selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATIONARY fears, fanned by the latest data from the US and the UK,
sparked a wave of selling in the world's bond markets, as investors worried
that the bull market for bonds could be nearing an end.
Any further signs of a revival in inflationary pressures are likely to
prompt more selling, since the bullish tone of recent months has been
predicated on low inflation and falling real interest rates.
UK GILT prices ended 1 1/2 points lower, as poor inflation numbers and a
weak US market combined to drag prices down.
'The market fell a point this morning on the UK inflation numbers and then
the best part of a point this afternoon, when the US market showed renewed
weakness,' said one trader. 'I think we are seeing a correction. Sooner or
later the bull market in bonds will come to an end, and possibly a very
nasty end, but all we've had so far is a couple of nasty inflation numbers
from both sides of the Atlantic.'
The 0.4 per cent rise in underlying inflation in August, to produce an
annual rate of 3.1 per cent, up from 2.9 per cent in July, prompted concern
that some analysts may have been too hasty in writing off inflationary
pressures.
Dealers said that prices had been marked down, but there was no wholesale
dumping of bonds. However, some signs of currency weakness prompted fears of
further sales by foreign investors, particularly as the threat of a public
sector wage freeze has prompted fears of a 'winter of discontent' in the UK,
dealers said.
Long gilt futures on Liffe, London's futures exchange, ended at 111 1/2 ,
down 1 3/4 points, with record volume of 124,000 contracts.
GERMANY and other hard-core European markets held up better. Bund futures
fell 0.20 points, while cash prices ended only slightly lower, supported by
a generous DM24.4bn injection of liquidity at the Bundesbank fixed-rate repo
yesterday.
Dealers said the market was also supported by the strength of the D-Mark,
which rallied against the dollar.
However, the market is not immune from the inflationary fears upsetting
other sectors and dealers said that there was no large inflow of fresh funds
from other markets.
'The big moment will be next week, when preliminary inflation numbers are
released,' said one trader. 'We have heard a lot about inflation coming down
and the market wants to see some evidence.'
The Belgian bond market also held up well, ending little changed after the
central bank cut its key central rate from 10 1/4 per cent to 10 per cent.
Dutch bond prices were slightly weaker in low volume.
EUROPE'S high-yielding bond markets in Spain and Italy suffered sharp
reversals yesterday, amid the general nervousness.
Spanish government bonds fell nearly two points, as concern over wage
negotiations fuelled inflationary fears. Italian bond prices fell less
sharply, but still dropped nearly a point, with worries about the budget
negotiations resurfacing.
FRENCH bonds dropped half a point, with the market divided over whether or
not to hope for an interest rate cut today.
Some dealers said they felt Mr Jean-Claude Trichet was unlikely to opt for
an interest rate cut on his first day as Bank of France governor. However,
other traders said that the market was running out of patience in the wait
for further cuts.
CONTINUED heavy selling in the wake of Tuesday's worrying inflation news
sent US Treasury long bond yields sharply higher yesterday morning, but a
strong afternoon recovery helped bring long back below 6 per cent.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down only 3/16 at
103 19/32 , yielding 5.985 per cent. Earlier it had been more than a point
lower, with the yield above 6 per cent. At the short end the two-year note
was up  3/16 at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.841 per cent.
There was no new economic news to affect the market but that did not stop
investors at the opening from further selling of longer-dated government
securities as the sharp correction following the strong summer rally
gathered pace.
Unlike earlier in the year, when buyers quickly reappeared after brief
declines in the market, retail accounts were initially unwilling buy
Treasuries big losses. However, prices rallied later in the day, aided by
dealer short-covering and strong demand for intermediate-dated securities.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: JP Morgan sets up index on
Latin American bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN has set up the first index to track the performance of
international bonds issued by Latin American corporate and sovereign
borrowers.
Eurobond issuance by Latin American borrowers has grown rapidly since 1990,
when Mexico led the way for them to access the international capital markets
for the first time since the debt crisis of the 1980s.
According to JP Morgan, Dollars 10.9bn worth of Eurobonds were issued by
Latin American borrowers in the first eight months of this year, compared
with just Dollars 1.1bn in 1990.
Ms Jeanne Feldhusen, head of JP Morgan's emerging markets fixed-income
research group, said the index had been set up in response to investor
demand for a tool to analyse this rapidly-growing market on a more objective
basis.
JP Morgan's Latin Eurobond index aims to provide investors with a benchmark
which will allow them to compare risks and returns in this market with more
established fixed-income markets around the world.
The index will track the liquid or traded market for fixed-rate,
dollar-denominated Eurobonds issued by Latin American borrowers. It
comprises 46 bonds with a total amount outstanding of Dollars 8.6bn, which
represents about 35 per cent of the total face value.
The bonds are issued by borrowers located mainly in Argentina, Brazil,
Mexico and Venezuela. Corporate issues make up 57 per cent of the index,
with sovereign issues comprising the remaining 43 per cent.
The index tracks returns on Eurobond issues from the end of 1991. Since
then, the index has had a return of 25.8 per cent, with corporate issues
outperforming sovereign issues.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Italy increases 30-year tranche of
global issue to meet demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OVERWHELMING demand for long-dated paper enabled the Republic of Italy to
increase its first global bond offering by Dollars 500m to Dollars 5.5bn
yesterday.
As a result of this deal, which sets a record for a global bond offering,
Goldman Sachs heads the Eurobond league table for the first time, according
to IFR Securities Data, pushing Deutsche Bank, the long-time holder of this
position, into second place.
Joint lead managers Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers said the decision to
increase the 30-year tranche to Dollars 3.5bn from Dollars 3bn was taken to
satisfy demand from US investors who were buying Italian government bonds
for the first time. The 10-year tranche remained unchanged at Dollars 2bn.
Commenting on the bond issue, Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister,
said: 'Issuing a 30-year global bond shows the Treasury has the confidence
that investors fully appreciate the government's work in improving
public-sector finances and rigorously fighting inflation; two fundamental
steps for Italy's economic recovery and for improving its long-term growth
prospects.'
He added that yesterday's issue was part of a strategy to renew Italy's
presence in the international markets, extend the maturities of Italian
public debt and confirm the intention to create a mix of domestic and
international borrowings.
'The deal will also help to make Italian paper more liquid and contribute to
the creation of new benchmarks for investors,' Mr Barucci said.
Just over one-third of the bonds were placed with US investors, a larger
proportion than expected. The remainder were sold to investors in Europe and
east Asia.
The lead managers said strong demand enabled Italy to achieve the lowest end
of the indicated price range.
The 30-year tranche will be priced to yield 80 basis points over the 7 1/8
per cent US Treasury due 2023, and the 10-year to yield 62 basis points over
the 5 3/4 per cent Treasury due 2003.
The success of the deal was mainly due to the shortage of 30-year paper in
the US, brought about by the US Treasury's decision to issue fewer 30-year
bonds. The pricing of Italy's offering was also widely perceived to be
generous, which syndicate managers attributed to Italy's desire for a
successful deal.
However, the lead managers said the yield differential between the two
tranches was narrower than that currently on the World Bank's 10-year and
30-year global bonds.
Elsewhere, weakness in the French government bond market and tight pricing
hampered the launch of the European Investment Bank's FFr2bn offering of
11-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield just eight basis points
above the French government's 8 1/4 per cent OAT due 2004.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: CME to relaunch derivatives
in French francs
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange plans to relaunch French franc futures and
options contracts. Trading is due to restart on Monday.
The new contracts will represent FFr500,000 each. This is twice the size of
the CME's last attempt to interest traders in French currency derivatives.
'With the French franc unravelling relative to the D-Mark, and volatility
increasing rapidly, we've had a remarkable number of requests for the
(franc) contract,' said Mr David Lerman, director of the CME's currency
product marketing.
The CME, which trades D-Mark, sterling, Swiss franc, yen and Canadian dollar
contracts, last traded French franc futures in 1990. A lack of volume
prompted the exchange to shelve the product. The Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, which lists French franc options, is the only other US exchange
that trades franc derivatives.
Mr Lerman said the CME plans to open trading in French franc 'rolling spot'
contracts, which approximate over-the-counter currency trades, in early
1994. It has no immediate plans to list the currency futures on Globex, the
after-hours electronic trading system.
The CME and the New York Mercantile Exchange have finalised plans jointly to
develop a standardised trade clearing system, first announced in May. The
Dollars 19.35m project is expected to set a standard for other US futures
exchanges.
Co-operation in clearing could lead the exchanges into other joint ventures,
said CME chairman Mr Jack Sandner. He said the CME and Nymex, best known for
its energy futures contracts, might re-enter negotiations on Globex.

THE AUSTRALIAN federal government is to favour small investors when it sells
off a further 19.9 per cent stake in Commonwealth Bank of Australia next
month, writes Nikki Tait from Sydney.
Mr Ralph Willis, minister for finance, said the government plans to sell
about 178m shares to investors, reducing the authorities' holding in the
bank from 70 per cent to a minimum of 50.1 per cent.
The sale is expected in October, soon after the bank's annual report is
published. Up to 65 per cent of the issue will be available to retail
investors. The price will be determined by a tender or 'book-building'
process. The issue is widely expected to raise upwards of ADollars 1.5bn
(USDollars 982m).

<TEXT>
THE CZECH Republic's nascent domestic bond market took another step in its
development yesterday with the launch of the first issue of floating rate
notes (FRNs) by a corporate borrower, writes Antonia Sharpe.
Glavunion, the flat glass manufacturer which is 67 per cent owned by
Glaverbel of Belgium, raised Kcs350m (Dollars 13m) through an offering of
four-year FRNs. The notes carry a semi-annual coupon equivalent to 40 basis
points over the Prague interbank offered rate, which currently stands at 12
7/8 per cent.
Glavunion, which last year became the first Czech company to issue
medium-term bonds in the domestic market, will use the proceeds of the
offering to finance its Kcs2.6bn investment programme.
The notes were placed with Czech banks and other financial institutions,
said an official at lead manager CSFB.

CONSOB, Italy's stock markets and companies watchdog, may meet as early as
next Monday to respond to criticisms of its role and consider a replacement
for one of its five commissioners who is planning to resign.
Last night, the agency issued a statement defending its decision not to
suspend trading in the shares of the troubled Ferruzzi group. Consob has
been attacked for alleged lapses in monitoring Ferruzzi's affairs.
Consob's next meeting is expected to discuss a replacement for Mr Roberto
Artoni, one of its commissioners, whose plan to resign after little more 18
months has been seen as indicative of a deeper malaise in the agency.
The need for a new appointment could give Consob a chance to demonstrate
some independence from Italy's political establishment. Consob's chairmen
have almost invariably been drawn from the Christian Democrat party.
Calls for a full-scale reform of Consob have come from across the political
spectrum, with senior spokesmen from both the opposition Party of the
Democratic Left (the former Communists) and the autonomist Lombard League
demanding changes to make the agency more effective.
This week, the chairman and deputy chairman of the finance committee in the
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, announced plans to add legislation on
giving Consob greater powers to laws currently being considered on making
share ownership more attractive.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Saudi bank prepares to account
for itself - NCB is publishing its first audited accounts for four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom's biggest bank in
asset terms, is preparing to publish its first set of audited accounts for
four years.
Mr Michael Callen, former head of global finance at Citibank, was brought in
four months ago by the Mahfouz family, majority shareholders of the bank, as
senior adviser to the chairman Sheikh Mohammed bin Mahfouz. He is hopeful
that the accounts will appear shortly.
Mr Callen has been given the job of restructuring management, improving
operations and restoring the bank's image.
This has been tarnished by a fraud indictment in the US against Sheikh
Kahlid bin Mahfouz, NCB's former chief operating officer, and a Dollars 10bn
law suit launched by Touche Ross, liquidators of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
Just how damaging the legal actions have been is difficult to judge. 'I
don't know what our reputation is,' said Mr Callen. 'People don't tell you
when you're the ugliest girl in the playground.'
In spite of its problems, managers say that the audited accounts will
confirm NCB's place as one of the biggest private commercial banks in the
world.
More importantly, they will show NCB's capital:asset ratio to be within the
tier one 4 per cent minimum set by the Basle guidelines.
The last three sets of accounts to be published - none has appeared since
1989 - were all qualified by the auditors. Since that time the bank's
financial position has been something of a mystery, and its position was not
eased by the suspension of its credit rating in June 1992 by the
Cyprus-based Capital Intelligence, the only rating agency to list the bank.
Mr Omar Bajamal, deputy general manager, said the bank was determined that
its next set of accounts would not be qualified. References to court actions
are expected to appear in footnotes.
The closure of the bank's London office last year, enforced by the Bank of
England, and the corresponding closure of the New York branch - together the
branches had assets totalling some Dollars 2.5bn - had a significant impact
on NCB's balance sheet.
Mr Bajamal maintained that the bank had improved its Saudi depositor base.
Total bank assets, said Mr Bajamal, had dipped below Dollars 20bn in 1992
but had recovered some lost ground in the first quarter of 1993.
The bank considered a public placing at one stage but decided that the risk
was too great at a time when many Saudi companies were competing for
capital. It is still an option, however, when the present difficulties have
been overcome.
Mr Bajamal said that none of the bank's 230 branches would close as a result
of the internal restructuring currently being carried out, but NCB would be
shedding 1,500 jobs from its 7,400 workforce in the next few months.
He dismissed as wild speculation US reports that the bank's problem loans,
many of them said to have been with the Saudi royal family, ran into tens of
billions of dollars.
However, other sources suggest that NCB's problem loans amounted to about
Dollars 2.5bn, almost a third of the bank's loan portfolio and several times
its net worth. Many loans are understood to have been restructured.
The relationship with the Saudi royal family is one of the most sensitive
issues within the bank. The very presence of the royal business means that
it is difficult to appraise the bank's position using normal financial
criteria.
'The idea that they (the royal family) would just stuff the NCB at the end
of the day, given that they own the country and are responsible to the
depositors as a result, defies logic,' said Mr Callen.
NCB's accounts will be emerging after a difficult period for many of Saudi
Arabia's banks, following an end to the construction boom which did much to
boost lending margins in the late 1980s.
NCB is the only Saudi bank in private hands. There has been some talk of the
Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the central bank, taking a stake in NCB but
this has been successfully resisted by the owners.
In the meantime Sheikh Kahlid bin Mahfouz and the bank are separately
fighting various legal actions in the US and the UK. He has been indicted on
fraud charges by Mr Robert Morgenthau, New York district attorney.
NCB, itself in dispute with the US Federal Reserve, has set aside Dollars
22m for possible penalties, although it is arguing against accusations that
it violated filing regulations.

MONUMENT OIL and Gas, the UK oil exploration and production company, has
agreed terms for a Pounds 300m (Dollars 462m), 10-year syndicated loan to
finance the development of the Liverpool Bay oil and gas fields in the UK.
Chase Investment Bank and Union Bank of Switzerland arranged the loan.
The estimated development cost is Pounds 270m. The additional amount will be
used to refinance some pre-development costs and cover any overrun, said Ms
Liz Airey, Monument's finance director. Ms Airey declined to comment on the
margin over Libor which the company will pay before the loan is signed.
Ms Airey said that approval from each of the partners to proceed with the
project is due by the end of the month, and Department of Trade and Industry
approval is expected by the end of October.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Study says Norwegian banks to
double profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S commercial banks, emerging from crisis, are set to more than double
composite operating profits, after credit losses, to NKr3.6bn (Dollars 515m)
next year. According to a central bank study, this will compare with
forecast profits of NKr1.45bn for this year.
The study, which looks at the effects of lower interest rates on bank
earnings, expects the banks to continue to recover. The sector made a
composite NKr813m profit for the first six months of 1993.
Lower rates will also have a positive effect on banks' property portfolios,
triggering a significant rise in value. The value of individual bank loans
will increase because of improved possibilities for those loans to be
serviced.
The study forecasts a rise in composite net interest income to NKr12.2bn in
1994, or 3.21 per cent of assets, from a forecast of NKr11.7bn, or 3.17 per
cent of assets, for 1993. In the first six months of 1993, the banks
achieved composite net interest income of NKr5.52bn, or 3.04 per cent of
assets.
Banks are projected to cut losses on loans and guarantees in 1994 to
NKr4.8bn from a forecast NKr6.9bn in 1993. At the half-way mark of this year
credit losses were NKr3.3bn.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Citibank to buy out Hungarian
venture minority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITIBANK Overseas Investment, part of the big US bank, is to take full
ownership of its Hungarian joint venture by buying the 20 per cent held by
the National Bank of Hungary, the central bank.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The joint venture, Citibank Budapest,
was set up in 1985. It made Ft1.36bn (Dollars 14m) profit after tax in 1992
on a prime capital of Ft1.93bn.
Citibank Budapest has concentrated on operating with local subsidiaries of
international companies and has helped create new capital markets, like that
for commercial paper. It announced yesterday a Ft2bn commercial paper issue
for Ciba Hungaria, part of the Swiss Ciba-Geigy group.
Recent national banking legislation called for the central bank to dispose
of shareholdings in domestic banks. These stakes were built up at a time
when the authorities were reluctant to allow foreign entities full
ownership.
The central bank is soon expected to sell its 20 per stake in Unicbank,
another joint venture bank. The buyer is expected to be Austria's Raffeisen
group, which owns 72 per cent of the shares.
There is greater uncertainty surrounding the future of the the National
Bank's 34 per cent stake in Central-European International Bank (CIB), in
which it is partnered by five western banks. CIB, the first and largest of
Hungary's joint venture banks, has special offshore status.
Its offshore classification exempts CIB from Hungarian reserve requirements
and, rivals claim, gives it a competitive advantage. Hungary's finance
ministry is pushing hard for the central bank to give up its stake and to
relinquish CIB's offshore status.
Hungary's joint venture banks have succeeded in winning big customers from
the large state-owned commercial banks, which have had to wrestle with
provisions against loan losses. A recent World Bank report said that most of
Hungary's commercial banks were 'technically insolvent under international
accounting standards'.
Competition for top-tier clients in Hungary is increasing as western banks
set up branches in Hungary. Credit Lyonnais is due on Friday to inaugurate
its Budapest office.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine
Matheson group, yesterday announced higher first-half profits and an
increased dividend.
Net profits rose to USDollars 66.2m for the six months ended June, an 11 per
cent increase over the USDollars 59.9m of 1992. The interim dividend is
going up to USDollars 1.55 a share from USDollars 1.48.
Profits growth was primarily attributable to a halving of losses from
Spanish retailer Simago and an improved performance from group operations in
Taiwan, which have returned to profit.
Turnover increased by only 2 per cent to USDollars 2.38bn, due to losses in
translation from currency movements and the impact of the sale of the
group's food manufacturing operations to a joint venture with Nestle, the
Swiss foods group.
Operating losses from Simago fell to USDollars 8.3m from USDollars 16.5m as
Dairy Farm continued to cut staffing levels and close unprofitable shops.
However, the performance was also aided by the weakness of the peseta.
Simago was purchased for HKDollars 983m (USDollars 127m) in 1990 but is not
expected to return to profit until 1995.
In Australasia, Franklins increased its market share but continued to suffer
from the tough economic conditions and strong competition. In New Zealand,
however, the group's two retail operations put in strong performances.
The Hong Kong retail operations are under pressure from staff and rental
costs, but contributed a profit increase. The company says the colony offers
limited scope for further expansion and it is now looking to Taiwan to
provide growth for its Asian business.
Describing the six-month performance as satisfactory, it said full-year
profits were expected to exceed 1992 levels. The ice-cream making joint
venture with Nestle in Hong Kong and China was making progress.

The next stage of the Czech capital market's development is likely to be at

Glavunion is keen to promote the development of the local capital market,
which it regards as an important future source of financing. However, for
now the market is restricted to the better-known and better-capitalised
Czech companies.

HARCOURT GENERAL, the publishing, retailing and movie house business which
used to be known as General Cinema, yesterday announced it was severing its
ties with its origins by spinning off its theatre chain business in a
distribution of stock to shareholders.
General Cinema, which started as a movie house business and owns a majority
stake in department stores group Neiman Marcus, acquired Harcourt Brace, the
publishing company, in a Dollars 1.4bn takeover in 1991. In March this year
it changed its name to Harcourt General.
Mr Richard Tarr, chief executive, said that 'although the theatre business
represents the historical foundation upon which our company has been built,
it is today a relatively small component of Harcourt General and represented
slightly less than 5 per cent of 1992 operating earnings.'
He believed the business would benefit from being a separate company with
direct access to capital markets and freedom to pursue investments and
acquisitions.
General Cinema Theatres operates 1,351 screens at 248 locations and had
operating earnings before corporate expenses of Dollars 11.9m in the year to
October 1992, on sales of Dollars 457m. In the nine months to July it had
Dollars 20.9m in earnings on Dollars 380m in sales.
Harcourt General shareholders will receive one share in the new business, GC
Companies, for every 10 shares of Harcourt General common and class B stock.
Harcourt General will have no further stake in the business.

FEDERAL Express, the biggest overnight delivery company in the US, cut
operating losses in its international operation by Dollars 24m to Dollars
33.2m in the three months to end August, helping to treble net income
compared with same quarter last year.
After-tax earnings for the first quarter of its financial year were Dollars
32.9m, up from Dollars 10.1m a year ago before the effect of accounting
changes.
Mr Frederick Smith, chairman, said the results were encouraging, but warned:
'Because last year's first-quarter results were disappointing, the
year-on-year comparison for the rest of this fiscal year may not be as
dramatic.'
Future earnings growth will depend on further revenue gains in the
international priority sector, which were up 17 per cent in the first
quarter.

HONEYWELL has settled its autofocus camera patent infringement dispute with
Fuji Photo Film and its US unit, Fuji Photo Film USA, heading off a civil
trial scheduled for October, AP-DJ reports.
Honeywell said the settlement called for Fuji to pay an undisclosed amount,
which will be included in Honeywell's financial results for the third
quarter ending September 30.
The company said it has agreed to drop its lawsuit, filed in US District
Court in New Jersey, alleging that Fuji used Honeywell's automatic focus
camera technology without permission.

APPLE Computer of the US yesterday announced plans to expand in China by
opening a representative office, naming a Chinese distributor and opening a
computer training centre, AP-DJ reports from Beijing.
With its fast-expanding economy, China 'holds an enormous amount of
potential for us,' said Mr Michael Spindler, Apple's president.
Mr William James, Apple managing director for eastern Asia, estimated about
10,000 Apple Macintosh personal computers are already installed in China.
He said sales should more than double annually in coming years, and he
predicted the company would soon be selling more than 10,000 units a year in
China.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Reebok fires two agencies

<TEXT>
REEBOK International, the US athletic shoe and apparel manufacturer, has
fired its two main advertising agencies and consolidated its entire Dollars
140m advertising account with Leo Burnett Co of Chicago.
The dismissal of the New York office of Chiat/Day and Euro RSCG of London
follows a disappointing sales performance by Reebok in the second quarter.
In the period, Reebok - whose current advertising features US basketball
star Shaquille O'Neal - experienced a 3.5 per cent fall in worldwide
footwear sales and a 9.5 per cent drop in the US. Net revenue fell to
Dollars 657.6m, against Dollars 701.9m in the 1992 quarter. Meanwhile, sales
by arch-rival Nike have climbed.
The company said it had decided to consolidate the business at Burnett to
take advantage of its worldwide network of 55 offices in 40 countries.
'We need the strength of a global agency,' the company explained. Burnett
previously handled the Reebok brand in Latin America and Asia, with
estimated advertising billings of Dollars 20m.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Coca-Cola Company warned yesterday that a recent revision of the US tax
code would reduce its full-year earnings by 4 cents a share.
The Atlanta-based soft drinks company said its effective consolidated tax
rate for 1993 would increase by one-half of one percentage point on an
annualised basis, to 31.3 per cent. It estimates its effective tax rate for
1994 at 32.5 per cent.
The higher 1993 tax rate will reduce Coca-Cola's net income by about Dollars
55m. Most of the charge against earnings is to be reflected in third-quarter
results, scheduled for release on October 21.
Analysts had forecast 1993 earnings per share at Dollars 1.70 to Dollars
1.71, or about 18 per cent higher than last year's Dollars 1.43. The higher
tax rate would reduce earnings to about Dollars 1.66.
Mr Terry Bivens, who follows the company for Argus Research of New York,
said that the impact of the tax changes was in line with expectations.
Last week, PepsiCo announced that the new federal tax legislation would
reduce its 1993 earnings by about 5 cents a share.
Coca-Cola also said that it expected its worldwide unit-case sales in the
third quarter to grow by between 4 per cent and 5 per cent over the
year-earlier period, down from the 6 per cent growth attained in the second
quarter of 1993.
Third-quarter growth in US unit-case sales, perhaps the best indicator of
strength at the retail level, was estimated at between 5 per cent and 6 per
cent.
On Wall Street, Coca-Cola closed down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 43 7/8 .

Dollars 372m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which has been shrinking through
the sale of large parts of its business, yesterday announced plans to
distribute Dollars 372m, or Dollars 12 a share, of the disposal proceeds to
its shareholders - the third such cash disbursement this year.
General Dynamics said that the total represented substantially all of the
cash available for tax-advantaged distribution from sales of businesses to
date. The company paid out Dollars 20 a share in April and Dollars 18 a
share in July.
The latest distribution will be made on October 12 to shareholders of record
on September 28. General Dynamics shares closed Dollars 2 7/8 higher at
Dollars 99 1/2 .
Mr William Anders, chairman, said the move underscored 'our continuing
belief that the most efficient way to convert surplus defence assets to
productive non-defence uses is to return funds in excess of our financial
and reinvestment needs directly to our investors'.
The company also increased its quarterly dividend by 50 per cent to 60 cents
a share, reflecting the board's confidence in the stability of its strong
cash flows.

Dollars 420m charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, will take a
Dollars 420m after-tax charge in the third quarter to reflect the completion
of a plan to shed its chemicals businesses and Dollars 100m of environmental
clean-up costs.
The company said yesterday that its chemicals business, Cytec Industries,
would be spun-off as a separate company on the New York Stock Exchange
shortly, with all outstanding Cytec ordinary shares being distributed to
Cyanamid shareholders as a taxable dividend.
Cyanamid will retain preferred stock convertible into 30 per cent of Cytec's
ordinary shares.
The move, along with the closure of chemicals operations not taken on by
Cytec, completes a two-year plan to retreat from chemicals and focus instead
on pharmaceuticals and products for the agricultural industry.
After-tax costs linked to the disposal and closures will be Dollars 320m in
the third quarter.
The chemicals business accounted for around Dollars 1bn of Cyanamid's
Dollars 5.3bn of sales last year, but only Dollars 34m of its Dollars 564m
operating income.
Cytec had assets at June 30 1993 of Dollars 1.1bn, and will have 6,700
employees.
The company will take on Dollars 225m of environmental liabilities and
Dollars 400m of liabilities for its employees' post-retirement health and
life insurance benefits.
Also yesterday, Cyanamid said it had reviewed its environmental position and
had decided to take an after-tax charge of Dollars 100m to reflect likely
clean-up costs.
The company said it will remain responsible for the environmental position
of Cytec's plant at Bound Brook, New Jersey after the spin-off is complete.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Head of Morgan Grenfell's wider
family - Two of a kind: Bankers with unique perspectives speak to David
Marsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, is a
British banker with a difference: he enjoys a unique inside view of Deutsche
Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank. Deutsche Bank acquired Morgan
Grenfell at the end of 1989 in a Pounds 950m (Dollars 1.46bn) deal, and as a
result Mr Craven became the first non-German in the bank's 123-year history
to gain a seat on its management board.
Like the other dozen board members, he earned an estimated DM1.5m (Dollars
920,000) last year - nearly double the Morgan Grenfell chairman's Pounds
330,000 (Dollars 508,200) salary in 1989.
After three-and-a half years of observing his august new parent company, Mr
Craven's enthusiasm is palpable. 'It is incredibly well managed and works
incredibly well.'
He spends two days a week visiting German companies or attending Deutsche
Bank meetings, and cites the length of Deutsche's board sessions - which
average five to six hours - as an example of the benefits of German
thoroughness. Each board member has executive responsibility for a specific
operating area. This means, he says, that measures agreed at the top can be
implemented through the group with smoothness and decisiveness.
Four Deutsche Bank board members, including Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's
board speaker, sit on Morgan Grenfell's board, taking part in all strategic
decisions. Deutsche Bank this year has increased its influence over the
management of Morgan Grenfell's German subsidiary, the country's leading
mergers and acquisition specialist. Nonetheless, Mr Craven says his bank has
maintained a separate identity within the Deutsche Bank group.
Morgan Grenfell's senior executive team has remained largely unchanged since
the takeover, even though overall staff numbers have dropped to 2,000 from
2,300. 'Deutsche Bank paid a goodwill sum of between Pounds 450m and Pounds
500m to reflect Morgan Grenfell's history, mentality and people. It would
have been foolish to have paid this price and then to have got rid of the
people.'
The Anglo-German link has brought complementary advantages. After turbulent
years during the 1980s, Morgan Grenfell has benefited from Deutsche Bank's
financial strength and deal-making contacts. After-tax profits last year, at
Pounds 56m, were double the 1990 level.
Deutsche has gained access to Morgan Grenfell's financial engineering skills
at a time when German companies have been seeking novel responses to the
challenges of reunification and recession. 'The strength of the D-Mark, the
costs of unification, high welfare payments  - this has all contributed to a
situation where parts of German industry have become uncompetitive.'
These difficulties, according to Mr Craven, have increased demand in Germany
for Morgan Grenfell's expertise in areas such as mergers and acquisitions,
disposals and joint ventures. 'Deutsche Bank correctly anticipated that
German companies would increasingly use mergers and acquisitions to address
strategic objectives. Deutsche Bank didn't have a network of M&amp;A officers.
By contrast, we have 300 merger people around the world.
'Three years ago, Morgan Grenfell had an active relationship with less than
half a dozen major German companies. Now we have access to a majority of the
big German companies - perhaps 50 or 60.' About 30 German corporate deals in
which Morgan Grenfell has acted as adviser have been made public.
Because times are harder, he believes one central feature of the German
economic system - the country's 'universal' banks, playing combined roles as
lenders, traders in securities, and long-term shareowners - retains crucial
importance. 'A bank like the Deutsche Bank is a bit like a combination of
the National Westminster Bank, S. G. Warburg and the Prudential.
'If a company gets into trouble in Germany, the attitude of the Deutsche
Bank is: 'How can we assist it to get through this troubled period?' In
Britain, the moment a clearing banker knows there is a problem, the reaction
is, 'How quickly can we run our exposure down?' '

REEBOK International, the US athletic shoe and apparel manufacturer, has
fired its two main advertising agencies and consolidated its entire Dollars
140m advertising account with Leo Burnett Co of Chicago.
The dismissal of the New York office of Chiat/Day and Euro RSCG of London
follows a disappointing sales performance by Reebok in the second quarter.
In the period, Reebok - whose current advertising features US basketball
star Shaquille O'Neal - experienced a 3.5 per cent fall in worldwide
footwear sales and a 9.5 per cent drop in the US. Net revenue fell to
Dollars 657.6m, against Dollars 701.9m in the 1992 quarter. Meanwhile, sales

The company said it had decided to consolidate the business at Burnett to
take advantage of its worldwide network of 55 offices in 40 countries.
'We need the strength of a global agency,' the company explained. Burnett
previously handled the Reebok brand in Latin America and Asia, with
estimated advertising billings of Dollars 20m.
Reebok insisted that it was not dissatisfied with the creative work produced
by Chiat, which held the company's estimated Dollars 80m US advertising
account since 1991. To underline the point, it said it would continue airing
Chiat's 'Planet Reebok' campaign, featuring Mr O'Neal.
Euro RSCG was awarded Reebok's estimated Dollars 40m to Dollars 60m
pan-European account only last year.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trinkaus chief plays down its
parentage - Two of a kind: Bankers with unique perspectives speak to David
Marsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Herbert Jacobi, the chairman of Dusseldorf-based Trinkaus &amp; Burckhardt,
runs a foreign-owned bank. Part of his job, however, is to ensure that the
parentage of this two centuries-old German private banking house is not too
evident. Trinkaus &amp; Burckhardt is 70 per cent owned by Midland Bank of the
UK, which last year became part of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank group.
Trinkaus has been in foreign hands since the 1970s, when Citibank of the US
acquired a majority share which it sold to Midland in 1981. Now, however,
playing down its non-German ownership is a key part of the bank's strategy.
'Many customers do not know we are foreign-owned.'
The bank's shares are listed on the German stock market, and, in accord with
German private bank tradition, it is directed by five personally liable
managing partners, of whom Mr Jacobi, 58, is the most senior.
The emphasis on its credentials is designed to highlight that most essential
German business trait: reliability. 'Foreign banks in Germany have a
reputation as 'fair weather' institutions. There is a belief that foreign
head offices have only to whistle to call in loans. This can be fatal for an
important part of our business.
'No foreign bank in Germany has ever been successful,' says Mr Jacobi, who
joined Trinkaus in 1981.
He speaks from experience. In addition to spells at Deutsche Bank and BHF
Bank in Frankfurt, Mr Jacobi worked for Chase Manhattan between 1964 and
1977, spending several years running Chase's perennially lacklustre German
operations.
Although Trinkaus puts its German character in the foreground, its banking
activities are strongly international. It builds its business around what Mr
Jacobi calls the 'three pillars' of corporate finance, private asset
management and financial market operations, including new issue business and
foreign exchange. Net profits have been steady at DM40m (Dollars 24.6m)
annually during the past two years.
The bank's main customers are individuals with assets of more than DM1m and
companies with cross-border transactions which want to improve financial
management. A firm adherent of Germany's 'universal banking' tradition, he
is pleased that Trinkaus can offer services across the whole spectrum of
banking. 'I don't know a better way of being close to our customers.'
These customers are being squeezed, like Germany as a whole, by the
consequences of reunification. 'German unity is a terrible crisis - but also
an opportunity. There was no 'game plan' (to carry out unification three
years ago), because no-one believed it was possible.' Making a success of
German unity will, he says, take 10 to 12 years.
Mr Jacobi outlines two areas where German industrialists and bankers are
being forced to change their agenda. The first concerns the need to improve
efficiency by cutting costs and shifting production abroad. German
manufacturing costs, he says, are up to 30 per cent higher than those of
foreign competitors. 'I believe that German industry will overcome its
difficulties, but at the cost of mounting unemployment.'
The second big change is in the financial field. Because of the 'colossal
costs' of reunification, German companies are now more dependent on stock
market finance, including, crucially, on funds from foreign investors.
English phrases like 'shareholder value' and 'investor relations' -
increasingly in vogue in Germany - have no German equivalent, he explains
sardonically, since until recently these concepts had no place in the German
banking vocabulary.
Mr Jacobi is convinced that convergence of ideas and practices is taking
place in EC countries. 'But this is the result of force of circumstances,
not because of any bureaucratic project laid down in Brussels.' He is
distinctly sceptical about EC plans for economic and monetary union. 'I
believe in Europe, but not in the Maastricht timetable.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Amoco wins oil field agreement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMOCO, the US oil group, has secured a preliminary agreement to develop the
giant Priobskoye oil field in western Siberia, after a competitive bid with
other western companies.
The field has reserves of as much as 5bn barrels and could at its peak
produce 450,000 barrels a day, making it a field 'of world class', Amoco
said.
The break-up of the Soviet Union has provided one of the best opportunities
for western oil companies to acquire substantial new oil reserves.
The agreement gives the US company exclusive rights to negotiate a full
production-sharing agreement with the Russian government and the two Russian
companies which will jointly develop the field.
Amoco said it was likely to take more than 20 years to bring the field up to
full production. Its investment in the project will be 'in the billions of
dollars,' it added.

CS FIRST BOSTON, the investment banking arm of Switzerland's CS Holding, is
developing a company-wide compensation scheme as part of its efforts to meld
into a single global investment bank.
Compensation has been a controversial subject at the firm, which operated
until recently as three separate regional entities tied by revenue-sharing
agreements.
Mr Alan Wheat, chief operating officer, said the system might not be in
place until next year. 'Measurement systems in this company are not what you
would want them to be,' he said, adding that not all the issues surrounding
compensation had been resolved.
Mr Wheat said the arrangements might prompt further departures from the
firm, which suffered a number of defections earlier this year. 'I think
there are other people who may well leave,' he said.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: GM sells Allison division to
specialist buy-out team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the US automotive group, is to sell its Allison Gas Turbine
division to an investor group led by Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, the leveraged
buy-out specialists. Allison makes engines for the aerospace, industrial and
marine markets.
The two sides declined to disclose the value of the deal, but Wall Street
analysts estimated it would be worth around Dollars 300m.
The disposal is the latest in a series by GM designed to concentrate its
energies on improving its lossmaking North American automotive operations.
Other divestments over the past year include its Allison transmission
division, which was sold to ZF Friedrichshafen of Germany.
Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, which manages an equity capital pool of more than
Dollars 1bn, is one of the more prominent US buy-out investors. Its deals
include the Dollars 1.6bn 1991 buy-out of the computer printers group
Lexmark International from International Business Machines.
GM announced in April last year it was putting Allison up for sale. Mr
Joseph Rice, president of Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, said yesterday the firm
had been negotiating with GM for nearly two years. However, he said: 'For
some period of time GM had not really made up its mind that it wanted to
sell this business.'
Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice will be investing around Dollars 100m of equity in
the business. Allison's managers are expected to buy between 15 per cent and
20 per cent of company's common stock.
The management investment team will be led by Mr Blake Wallace, general
manager of the division since 1983, who will become president and chief
executive of the independent company, to be called Allison Engine.
Allison, which became a division of GM in 1929, had 1992 sales of around
Dollars 700m. It is profitable, though GM and Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice
declined to put a figure on this.
Its most important business is making engines for the aircraft industry. It
has been a supplier for the C-130 military transport since the start of that
programme, and also supplies civilian and military helicopters.
Mr Rice said it had important new products in the pipeline, and saw
particular opportunities in the market for so-called feeder airlines, which
run services into the hubs run by the leading American carriers.
Although the number of leveraged buy-outs has diminished greatly since their
peak in the 1980s, there has been a steady stream of medium-sized deals in
the US over the past two years. Some Wall Street analysts are forecasting a
substantial increase in activity.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Telefonica returns fire in data
network battle
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELEFONICA, the Spanish government-controlled telecoms group, has countered
an incursion by British Telecommunications into its domestic market by
launching its own data transmission network.
The response to BT was signalled yesterday when Telefonica announced an
agreement to supply voice and image services, as well as data, to Caja
Madrid, Spain's second-ranked savings bank, which has a national network of
1,200 offices.
BT fired the opening shot in the battle when it joined forces with Banco
Santander, the big domestic banking group, to form a data transmission
company aimed at capturing up to 20 per cent of the local market.
Investment in the BT venture, which will build on Santander's Megared data
company, will be around Pta80bn (Dollars 625m) spread over 10 years.
Telefonica said its service would be delivered early next year. It was
finalising negotiations for similar ventures with two large domestic groups.
Yesterday's development shows that competition will be strong in Spain's
recently deregulated data transmission market, and is indicative of the
struggle awaiting competing groups when business in cellular telephones is
liberalised next year.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank looks to fill in
the gaps - Chief executive Hilmar Kopper outlines his equities expansion
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bank is poised to expand its international equity operations as
part of plans to round off the foreign growth of the past 10 years.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive, said the bank did not feel 'under any
pressure' to make a stockbroking takeover. 'But if we see a gem, we might
take it, even if it's expensive,' he said.
Mr Kopper said dealing in shares and derivate products was the only area in
which the bank felt under-represented. 'We're basically happy with the
bank's structure now. There are just some geographical regions and product
areas to fill in,' he said. Predominant among them was equities, where the
bank, especially outside Germany, did not have the same international clout
it had in bonds or other banking activities.
Speaking just before a rare meeting of Deutsche Bank's 13-member managing
board in Milan this week, Mr Kopper stressed any stockbroking acquisition
would have to meet the bank's strict rules on adequate return on assets.
Takeover candidates were being regularly reviewed, subject to meeting the
bank's return on assets criteria.
The bank saw no contradiction between its growing interest in equities and
its continuing defence of German rules limiting shareholders' voting rights,
and protecting companies from takeovers.
In spite of the substantial reforms passed to improve Frankfurt's standing
as a financial centre, Mr Kopper said further measures, such as insider
trading laws and disclosure of minimum share stakes, were still needed to
bring domestic financial markets into line with the US and UK.
'I'm still a firm defender of restricting voting rights, as long as there
are no other tools in Germany to maximise transparency. Once we have such
instruments in place, I wouldn't want to defend restrictions. Indeed, I
think we would set an example ourselves,' he said.
Mr Kopper said Deutsche Bank was content with its European retail banking
network, meaning that acquisition-based expansion plans for France and
possibly the UK were now on the back burner. However, it was still keen on
expanding in Italy, where its Banca d'America e d'Italia subsidiary, bought
in late 1989, expects to have 160 branches by year-end.
Although Deutsche Bank's managing board has looked at about six Italian bank
acquisitions over the past 12 months, 'nothing had been quite perfect', said
Mr Ulrich Weiss, the managing board member responsible for Italy.
'We are quite willing to invest more in Italy,' said Mr Kopper. The targets
were small: regional banks with a tight cluster of branches in
economically-attractive regions.
Deutsche Bank was not interested in buying into the state-controlled banking
or insurance operations due to come on the market shortly under the Italian
government's privatisation plans. It was keen to play a part in Italian
privatisation, but remained wary of buying into any bank it felt was too big
for local staff to manage, he said.
On the earnings front, Mr Kopper confirmed that net group profits this year
would be broadly unchanged. There was considerable uncertainty over earnings
in the domestic market in the second half.
The bank might be obliged to make substantially higher bad-debt provisions,
he said.
The bank's forecast that Germany's recession had bottomed out, and for a
gradual recovery early next year, meant many small companies now in
difficulty could still go bankrupt if they failed to find adequate working
capital for the upturn, he warned.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: VW cautions on impact of
forecast DM1.2bn Seat loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE expected DM1.25bn (Dollars 781m) loss at Spanish subsidiary Seat will
have a 'considerable impact' on the Volkswagen's group earnings this year,
the company said yesterday.
It said an emergency cash injection of DM1.5bn would not have an immediate
effect.
Officials would give no firm forecasts, but maintained that the German
parent company would break even.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, yesterday told workers at the main
Wolfsburg plant that the parent and the group would make a profit in the
third quarter.
Meanwhile, analysts said any 'lingering illusions' that the group could
cancel out the first-half loss of DM1.6bn and break even this year had
evaporated. VW shares dropped DM11 to DM350.50 yesterday in a falling
Frankfurt market.
New figures produced by Mr Piech on vehicle deliveries so far this year
showed little improvement to support recent claims that orders were
improving steadily.
Total group deliveries to customers for the eight months to the end of
August were 2.1m, 13 per cent lower than in 1992.
Even though the figure for Germany was 24 per cent lower at 651,000, home
market share had risen 0.4 per cent to 20.5 per cent.
Deliveries in the rest of western Europe were down 20 per cent at 704,000,
and market share was 16.5 per cent.
He gave no figures for North America or Asia, where the group recently
admitted it was having difficulties. The new Golf, made in Mexico, is
finally filtering into the US. It had been launched in California, the
company said.
Mr Piech, who has steadily back-pedalled on earnings forecasts for this
year, yesterday also appeared to throw doubt on plans to build a new small
car, the Chico, in Wolfsburg.
This was still the aim, but only if 'production costs at the plant can be
reduced to compare with those on a green-field site', he said.
Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, a senior spokesman, said the group 'understood' the
decision by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal economics minister, to abandon
his role as peacemaker between VW and Adam Opel in their row over alleged
industrial espionage.
Opel was clearly not prepared to talk and Mr Rexrodt had recognised there
was nothing to be done.
The minister, speaking in Brussels, claimed a good part of his aim had been
achieved. He had 'never mediated in a formal sense,' he said.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Generali earmarks cash for
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, is considering spending 'more
than L200bn (Dollars 130.2m)' on investments or acquisitions in
'Anglo-Saxon' markets.
The outline of the move, contained in information linked to the prospectus
for the impending rights issue by Generali's Alleanza life subsidiary, gives
no clues as to where or when the money might be spent.
Generali says a study into investments in international pension fund or
reinsurance activities was 'in an advanced stage'. A number of Italian
insurers are believed to be examining the pension fund business in view of
new Italian legislation opening the door to private pension systems.
The leaked information also reveals that parent company premiums rose 14.4
per cent, to L4,618.5bn, in the first half, while premium income at group
subsidiaries soared 28.6 per cent to L8,600bn. The company warned that
official first-half results would not be released until later this month.
The 'Anglo-Saxon' investment is just one of a number of spending plans
earmarked for the L1,000bn cash pile on which Generali is still sitting
after its controversial L1,750bn 1991 rights issue.
Other possible investments include about L200bn for Latin America, between
L70bn and L80bn in east Asia, and up to L15bn in eastern Europe.
Senior executives have invariably played down the prospects of a big
takeover. Instead, they have emphasised that the group's cash pile, shortly
to be swollen by receipts from the complex Alleanza deal, would be ploughed
back into the business, or used for small, sectoral acquisitions.
The prospectus shows some L440bn has gone toward building a 5 per cent stake
in Banco Central Hispano-Americano, Generali's partner in a Spanish joint
venture.
Included in the leaked first-half figures is information that Generali's
overall proportion of claims to total premiums, including reinsurance, had
fallen to about 78 per cent, against 82 per cent last year. The claims ratio
was now around 72 per cent for the group's directly-written Italian
business, and 80 per cent for risks abroad.

Simint

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMINT, the Italian clothing group in which designer Mr Giorgio Armani has a
20 per cent stake, reported a collapse in net profits for the year ending
April 30, writes Haig Simonian. It blamed extraordinary charges and higher
borrowing costs.
Net earnings fell to L1.6bn (Dollars 1m) from L17.4bn. The dividend for
ordinary and preference shares is being cut to L50 from L150. Sales rose 7
per cent to L377.5bn.
Mr Luca Ramella, managing director, said the earnings fall had been
expected. He stressed that operating profits had risen by 10 per cent, to
L49.7bn from L45.2bn, in spite of a L7bn provision on stock and trade
credits. Net operating profits fell slightly, to L33.6bn from L34.1bn, after
a L5bn rise in depreciation to L16.1bn.
Mr Ramella blamed the profits plunge on one-off restructuring costs linked
to the virtual halving of the group's workforce, and an increase in interest
charges to L10bn.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Allied abandons Aitken proposals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Group, which holds about 30 per cent of Aitken Hume International,
the banking group, has decided not to pursue its proposals for Aitken
outlined in July at the time of its preliminary results.
The proposals - among other possibilities - involved investment by the group
in the Asia Pacific region.
The decision followed discussions between the Aitken board and Allied.
The Aitken board said yesterday that it continued to explore means by which
shareholders could realise the underlying value of their investment.

Losses at Verity Group, a manufacturer and distributor of Wharfedale and
Mission loudspeakers, widened from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 4.27m pre-tax for
the year ended June 30.
The deficit was scored after taking account of a provision of Pounds 1.7m
(Pounds 651,000) for reorganisation and restructuring costs together with
closure charges on discontinued operations.
Interest costs rose from Pounds 546,000 to Pounds 870,000.
Turnover of Pounds 16.23m (Pounds 8.56m) incorporated Pounds 8.7m from the
Mission companies for the eight and a half months since their acquisition.

Hartons Group, engaged in plastic sheet and film, doubled its losses from
Pounds 938,000 to Pounds 1.88m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30.
Comparative figures were restated to conform with FRS 3.
Turnover of continuing activities declined from Pounds 35.35m to Pounds

The directors said the depressed trading conditions in mainland Europe were

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inishtech, the Irish hygiene products and printing and packaging group
controlled by James Crean, announced pre-tax profits for the first half of
1993 virtually unchanged at IPounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.37m) compared with
IPounds 3.55m, on sales up from IPounds 24.24m to IPounds 27.03m.
The directors said the result was adversely affected to the extent of
IPounds 325,000 by the translation effect of a weak sterling/punt exchange
rate. Expressed in sterling, profits were up 10 per cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 17.9p (18.3p). There is a maiden
interim of 2.5p. Last year a single dividend of 6.05p was paid.

Profits of Try Group, the contractor and housebuilder, fell from Pounds
380,000 to Pounds 68,000 pre-tax for the half year ended June 30.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 62m compared with a previous Pounds

The directors said the early months of the year brought some improvement in
the rate of housing sales. However, this was not maintained and, despite a
revival in the past few weeks, 'prices are not yet at a level at which we
can generate profits'.
Earnings fell to 0.08p (0.71p) but the interim dividend is being maintained
at 0.5p. At period-end, net borrowings were down from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds

OIS International Inspection, the technical inspection services group,
returned profits of Pounds 1.44m pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 24.2m for the
six months ended June 30.
No directly comparative figures were available. The company came to market
at the tail end of last year and for the 12 months to end-December reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.74m, some 10 per cent ahead of the prospectus
forecast. Turnover totalled Pounds 46.8m.
Directors said the half year performance reflected the holding of margins in
a competitive environment, reduced interest charges and the elimination of
losses from discontinued activities.
The group's UK operations, based at Aberdeen and Stockton, performed 'well
ahead of expectations'.
A maiden interim dividend of 0.7p is being paid from full diluted earnings
of 3.2p.
The shares closed 3p higher at 77p.

FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Recent acquisitions help lift
Waterford to IPounds 11.4m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WATERFORD Foods, the Irish dairy group, has reported a 31 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to IPounds 11.4m (Pounds 10.7m) on turnover up 35 per cent
to IPounds 338.5m, for the six months ended June 30.
The company said all its divisions produced good performances, with the
exception of its Galloway West subsidiary in the US 'which was affected by
unfavourable trading conditions'.
Its newest acquisitions - Express Foods Ireland and Premier Dairies -
emerged as significant contributors to earnings. Waterford paid Grand
Metropolitan IPounds 63m for the two companies in August 1992 and the
acquisitions have given the group a 36 per cent share of the liquid milk
market in the Irish Republic and 70 per cent of the Dublin market.
Mr John Barry, the chairman, said the reorganisation and integration in the
north of the UK of the Heald's and UCD dairy businesses - acquired in
December 1991 - had also helped boost earnings and improve profit margins
from 4.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent.
Interest charges rose sharply to IPounds 7.23m (IPounds 3.03m), reflecting
the new acquisitions and the exceptionally high interest rates early in the
year during the ERM currency crisis. Operating cash flow however, also grew
strongly by 67 per cent to IPounds 26.9m, which the company said would be
used to reduce net debt and gearing to around 65 per cent by year end (78
per cent at the end of 1992).
Earnings per share grew by 20 per cent to 5.16p (4.29p), which Mr Joe Gill
of Riada stockbrokers in Dublin said 'was ahead of expectations'. He said
however, he was not adjusting his full-year pre-tax profits forecast of
IPounds 24.8m and an EPS of 11.3p 'as market conditions are not expected to
be as good in the second half. This will still represent good earnings
growth of 13 per cent though'.
An interim dividend of 1.19p (1.15p) has been declared.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lambert Howarth profits halved to Pounds
780,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a 15 per cent increase in sales, pre-tax profits of Lambert
Howarth showed a marked decline in the six months to end-June.
The footwear supplier reported turnover of Pounds 28.6m for the period, up
from Pounds 24.92m for the comparable six months. Some Pounds 2.2m of this
increase reflected recent acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits, however, were halved, from Pounds 1.52m to Pounds 780,000.
But last year's figure had the benefit of a one-off realisation of fixed
assets amounting to Pounds 263,000 and interest received of Pounds 240,000.
At the operating level profits were down by Pounds 263,000 to Pounds
755,000, principally because of the impact of exchange rates.
The interim dividend is being stepped up from 4.25p to 4.5p from earnings
more than twice covered at 9.8p (18.9p).

Fox Ridge, based in Nashville, Tennessee, is engaged in the construction and
sale of housing. Completion is expected to occur on or about October 5 -
Pounds 0.5m of the price represents compensation for a covenant not to
compete with Fox Ridge for a period of 5 years following the disposal.
In 1992 Fox Ridge made pre-tax profits of Dollars 1.6m on sales of Dollars

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Calor surges to Pounds 27.6m as
restructuring pays off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALOR GROUP, the liquefied petroleum gas distributor, more than doubled
first-half pre-tax profits as the benefits of a two-year restructuring
programme started to emerge.
They rose to Pounds 27.6m from Pounds 11.5m last time, which included
restructuring costs of Pounds 14.8m.
'A fair proportion of the restructuring is at last feeding its way through
to the bottom line,' said Mr Hamish Macpherson, group treasurer. After
allowing for the restructuring, profits were still 5 per cent ahead.
Price cuts made to defend Calor's UK market share resulted in a drop in
turnover to Pounds 152.8m from a previous Pounds 164.5m. Mild weather was
experienced early in both years, and the same tonnage of gas was sold in
both per-iods.
Mr Macpherson described the results as 'satisfactory, considering we did not
get the cold weather.' Five of the last six UK winters have been mild.
Margins also suffered from a slight rise in the price of gas supplies and
the weakening of sterling against the dollar. However, the company said its
cost reduction programme had helped it to improve its competitive position
against other fuel suppliers without materially affecting profits. The core
gas business made operating profits of Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 31m).
Total operating profit was Pounds 27.7m, up from Pounds 27m last time.
Net interest paid was Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 700,000), partly because of
lower rates, and partly because of lower borrowings. The latter reflected
the low level of capital expenditure because of lack of growth in the
domestic and commercial sectors. At the end of the half, gearing was zero
and the group had net cash of Pounds 25.9m.
Losses for the air separation business, which makes equipment for dispensing
beer, were reduced to Pounds 1.6m from a previous Pounds 3.8m. The company
said the division was making progress and had installed further systems
'with a high level of customer satisfaction.'
The Pam Gas Central European venture with SHV, the Dutch investment company
which owns 46.2 per cent of Calor's stock, and Primagaz, the French LPG
distributor, was continuing profitably in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia.
Earnings per share were up to 10.4p from 4.1p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 6p.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Co-op Bank almost doubles to Pounds 8.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER bad debt provisions and increased interest income helped to nearly
double pre-tax profits at Co-operative Bank to Pounds 8.1m in the 28 weeks
to July 23.
In interim figures released yesterday, the bank reported earnings of 0.37p
per share, compared with losses of 0.02p in the first half last year.
Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, said: 'We are very pleased. We are ahead
of where we thought we would be.'
The bank reduced provisions against bad debts by 14 per cent to Pounds 19.5m
(Pounds 22.8m). Mr Thomas said the reduction reflected more customers
repaying their debts and a 'cleaning out' of the corporate loan book.
Net interest income was Pounds 69.4m (Pounds 67.9m), after a reduction in
interest receivable to Pounds 133.7m (Pounds 178m) was more than offset by a
reduced interest charge of Pounds 64.3m (Pounds 110.2m).
Dealing profits more than doubled to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 760,000), while
non-interest income rose substantially to Pounds 55.8m (Pounds 49.2m).
Deposits rose by nearly 9 per cent, which Mr Thomas said partly reflected
the bank's ethical code launched last year. He said 36 per cent of new
customers mentioned this as one reason why they joined.
Staff costs rose to Pounds 43.3m (Pounds 41.3m) including severance payments
and miscellaneous costs of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m).
Other expenses jumped to Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 35.9m). These included higher
marketing and promotional costs, enhancing customer services - including a
switch to 24-hour operation of telephone banking and work on centralised
banking administration - technology and other infrastructure developments.
Operating income rose 8 per cent to Pounds 119.4m (Pounds 110.3m). The tax
charge was Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 1.6m). The interim balance sheet showed
contingent liabilities of Pounds 124.4m, down from Pounds 144m.
The bank's figures were presented in the format required by FRS 3, the new
accounting standard on the profit and loss account. Mr Thomas said: 'For Joe
Punter this is just a maze of numbers. And the definitions leave something
to be desired.'
But referring to the greater disclosure of information required by the
standard, he said: 'It must be in the best interests of depositors and
shareholders because it's all hanging out for you to see.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bernard Matthews shares up 6p after
recovery to Pounds 4.64m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Bernard Matthews climbed 6p to 79p as the poultry processor
announced pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks to July 18 more than doubled from
last time's depressed Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 4.64m. Turnover increased from
Pounds 65.7m to Pounds 88.9m.
Mr David Joll, managing director, said Matthews was in 'a recovery
situation', but had gained its profits rise 'under difficult conditions'.
The profits advance in continuing operations to Pounds 4.63m (Pounds 2.15m)
on turnover of Pounds 79.3m (Pounds 65.7m) came mostly from branded added
value products, he said, adding that this now included a new range of cooked
meats. This latter had grown from nothing a year ago to a Pounds 20m brand
now.
Also, the low-priced imports from Europe and the US which had adversely
affected 1992 had partly been pushed out by the devaluation of sterling as
well as by low-priced UK turkeys, Mr Joll said.
He emphasised that last year whole birds accounted for only 17 per cent of
sales and had been a loss-making part of the business.
Very competitively priced UK turkeys had driven up consumption at Easter
from about 2m normally to about 3.5m, partly because lamb had been
expensive.
Acquisitions - essentially Sarvari Baromfiipari, the Hungarian producer of
turkey, chicken, goose and duck meat acquired for Pounds 2.7m in March -
contributed Pounds 9.6m to turnover and Pounds 464,000 to profits. Mr Joll
expected the profits to rise once Matthews had brought its technology to
bear and introduced its product range. Sarvari serves the Hungarian,
Austrian and Swiss markets.
Progress in France, where Matthews will spend more than Pounds 4m in TV
advertising this year, has been slower. The company said it still has
substantial in-roads to make in the French market.
Rather than simply agreeing with the headquarters of the various French food
store chains to stock Matthews' products, Mr Joll said the company often had
to convince regional managers, and in some cases, individual store managers.
The dividend is lifted by a 'cautious' 10 per cent to 1.1p, payable from
increased earnings of 2.5p (1.13p) per share.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe up to Pounds 27m after currency
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWTHORPE, the UK-based international electronic and electrical components
group, brushed aside difficult first- half trading conditions to post a 20
per cent increase in pre-tax profits and raise the interim dividend.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 22.42m to Pounds 26.99m in the six
months to June 30 on turnover which grew by 30 per cent to Pounds 163.6m
(Pounds 125.6m) including Pounds 891,000 from acquisitions.
Earnings per share increased by 15 per cent to 9.05p (7.88p) and the group
is to pay an interim dividend of 1.88p (1.79p). The shares gained 4p to
close at 360p yesterday.
Currency movements added Pounds 16.4m to turnover in the first-half and
Pounds 3.1m to pre-tax profits. A further, smaller currency gain is expected
during the current half.
Mr John Westhead, chief executive, commenting on the results said, 'we are
pleased to have produced a useful improvement in performance in what has
been a difficult operating environment.
'For 1993 as a whole, we expect to report further modest organic growth. In
the US demand shows steady growth, but Germany continues in recession. In
the UK the recovery is patchy but continuing.'
Group operating profits rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 21.9m),
while net interest payments totalled Pounds 594,000 (Pounds 548,000
receipts).
UK operating profits increased to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 4.8m) reflecting the
acquisitions made in 1992 and a small degree of improvement in general
economic conditions. UK operations contributed 25 (22) per cent of group
profits while sales increased by 37 per cent to Pounds 50.7m.
In the US, generally improving demand, together with improved efficiency and
market penetration produced higher operating profits of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds
6.3m) on sales which grew by 45 per cent to Pounds 51.6m.
However operating profits from Bowthorpe's Continental European operations -
mainly in Germany - slipped by 3 per cent to Pounds 8.8m, with gains on
currency offset by the effects of the recession.
Despite acquisitions which totalled Pounds 4.8m and Pounds 10.5m of capital
expenditure during the first half, the group generated Pounds 7.5m (7.4m) in
net cash. Net borrowings totalled Pounds 16m at the end of June, down from
Pounds 17.2m at the end of December, giving gearing of 14 per cent.
COMMENT
Bowthorpe continues to outperform expectations with profit gains in the US
and UK more than offsetting the downturn in Continental Europe. Sales and
operating profits from electronics now represent about two-thirds of the
total with electrical products holding the balance - a reversal of the
postion three years ago. Meanwhile Bowthorpe's highly selective acquisition
strategy will continue. Full year pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 50m
producing earnings of 17.1p and a lofty but deserved prospective p/e of 21.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Knocked off the published timetable -
National Express has been forced to rethink its business strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LINGERING recession has delayed the arrival of National Express at the
destination for which it set out when it was floated last December.
When it came to the market, the coach group mapped out a route to a more
efficient and modern structure with plans to refurbish ageing bus stations,
upgrade its express coach fleet and to invest in a new reservation system.
National Express assumed it could justify the modernisation programme,
necessary if the group was to squeeze greater margins from its low budget
customers, because it expected passenger volumes to grow as the recession
came to an end.
Its plans, however, have been frustrated by British Rail, which has lured
away coach travellers with fare discounts of up to 80 per cent. The coach
company has complained that InterCity, the express division of BR, has used
cross-subsidies from other parts of the rail network to offer fares which it
finds hard to match.
'We thought that the recession was over and that people would be spending
more money. We were ready to put emphasis on better quality. But BR is
competing on price only, not on quality,' says Mr Adam Mills, deputy chief
executive at National Express.
Recession and the cost of cutting its workforce by 10 per cent took their
toll on the interim results reported earlier this week. Pre-tax profits fell
46 per cent to Pounds 585,000 after Pounds 427,000 of redundancy charges in
its express coach division. Turnover slipped from Pounds 59m to Pounds
57.7m. The shares however, which dipped slightly on the results, closed down
12p to 256p yesterday, well ahead of their 165p flotation price.
Wary of the continuing impact of the recession and uncertain how long BR
will maintain aggressive price competition, the group has decided to slow
the pace of new investment in its core express coach business.
Moves to computerise reservations and ticket inquiries are more likely to
involve expansion of the existing system to include mechanised ticketing
rather than a completely new system. Meanwhile, coach station refurbishment
is proceeding on a piecemeal basis: the Liverpool hub is being upgraded with
the aid of local authority and EC grant aid, for example, but plans to
redevelop the Birmingham station have been postponed.
The relaunch of its fleet of Rapide coaches has also been delayed until next
year because of new technical modifications to meet new EC and Department of
Transport regulations.
Mr Mills says the delays have not been forced on the company by cash
constraints. It is being cautious with its strategy rather than expanding
rapidly, he says. 'We've slowed the pace of investment in National Express
Coaches to ensure we get a payback on our spending.'
Hampered by the difficult trading conditions in its inter-city coach
business, the company has embarked recently on alternative routes to reach
the goal of steady profits.
National Express is offsetting declining demand for its domestic services by
developing its participation in Eurolines, the inter-European coach service
comprising 40 different companies, in which the UK group now claims to be
one of the leading players.
Traffic volumes to western European cities have grown by 18 per cent since
flotation, and passenger demand on routes to the east have exceeded
expectations. 'Services to Warsaw and Prague have grown rapidly from a
standing start; we're running 18 full coaches a week to Poland,' says Mr
Mills.
By the end of the decade National Express expects passenger volume on
services in Europe, where it enjoys a greater price differential against
airlines, to match its domestic network. Yet competition with airlines on
some European routes has not deterred the company from forging alliances
with the aviation industry at home.
National Express's exposure to airports, which first began through
inter-airport coach services such as between Heathrow and Gatwick, has given
the group an appetite for more. The company already has passenger transfer
contracts with British Airways and is now discussing links with other
airlines.
The scope is enormous - the group's Birmingham-based management team has
examined services as diverse as baggage handling services, aircraft tugs and
even limousines for first class travellers.
Earlier this year, the company emphasised its move away from coach
operations with the Pounds 27.1m acquisition of East Midlands International
Airport in Leicestershire.
Mr Mills says the airport is a fairly small business, but its profits -
Pounds 3.36m in the year to last March - will be a welcome injection for the
group.
The acquisition - funded by a Pounds 3.75m rights issue, cash and Pounds
17.5m of medium-term bank debt - is part of a wider strategy to forge links
with tour operators and expand airport operations.
Mr Mills admits that the company is looking at other airports, but says it
is not about to make imminent acquisitions. Instead, it is opting for a
measured expansion of non-core activities while trying to enhance the
margins on its domestic coach business.
National Express, he claims, is negotiating its way slowly around the
obstacles of weak UK passenger demand while making strategic decisions to
reduce its reliance on coach services. 'We like high volume, low cost
transport. That means not bidding for assets which are overvalued; we will
specialise instead on turning round former state-owned enterprises.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Higher margins boost SR Gent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCENTRATION on higher margin products helped SR Gent, the
Barnsley-based Marks and Spencer garment supplier, report pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.52m for the year to June 30, a rise of 10 per cent on the
comparable Pounds 2.29m.
Turnover fell 6 per cent from Pounds 128m, including Pounds 2.66m from
discontinued activities, to Pounds 120.5m with Pounds 4.45m from
acquisitions. The fall for continuing activities was 5 per cent.
Mr Peter Wolff, chairman, said the sales fall was the result of the
rationalisation of certain ranges. He added that overseas production of
specialised garments had risen over the year to 40 per cent of sales by the
period end.
During the year the retail division became fully owned and was relaunched
under the Susan Woolf name. Mr Wolff said the financial impact was reflected
in the figures but would ease as additional stores came on stream.
The pre-tax figure was struck after share of losses of related companies of
Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 66,000) and net interest charges which fell from
Pounds 2.71m to Pounds 1.93m.
Earnings per share came out higher at 3.2p, against 2.4p and the proposed
final dividend is being raised to 1.35p making an increased total for the
year of 2.1p, compared with 2p.
The shares dipped 6p to 62p in a falling market.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Roskel slides to Pounds 528,000 at interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY RIMMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH TURNOVER and pre-tax profits were lower at Roskel, the suspended
ceiling systems group, for the first six months of 1993, and the directors
warn that trading in the short term was unlikely to improve.
The result was down from Pounds 652,000 to Pounds 528,000 from turnover of
Pounds 21.72m (Pounds 22.82m). The directors said however, that in the
medium term they looked forward to growth in the group's profitability 'as
the construction industry recovers from recession'.
The interim is maintained at 1.3p despite losses of Pounds 1.2m.
The directors reported that Roskel Contracts had been notable for its
consistent contribution to turnover and they said this company's strength in
the market place had enabled it 'to secure a satisfactory level of new
business, commercial as well as retail, but margins are under pressure'.
Sales at CP Supplies were ahead very slightly but profits, still affected by
bad debts, were lower than last time. Tenon Partition Systems incurred
development costs, but was expanding satisfactorily, they said.
Hire rates at Access Rental remained weak but utilisation improved a little
and enabled the company to trade at break even for the first time since
1990.
Pre-tax figure for the period was after interest payable of Pounds 179,000
(Pounds 218,000) and a Pounds 56,000 share of an associate's loss. Earnings
per share were 2.23p compared with 2.91p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVER Group, the footwear retailer, made progress in cutting its losses in
the first half of 1993 with a fall from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds 2.24m
pre-tax.
Turnover fell 11.5 per cent to Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 37.5m) the result of
branch closures. During the period 34 were closed with a further 16 poor
performing branches earmarked for the second half.
The pre-tax figure was helped by cost cutting and a lower interest charge of
Pounds 557,000 (Pounds 1.26m).
The company has announced the intended closure of Brick Studio, the
remaining non-footwear activity. Completion is scheduled for the fourth
quarter of this year.
Losses per share came out at 8.86p (19.28p).

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Everest Foods falls to Pounds 2.09m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATCHY demand for frozen chips and a fire at one of its sites reduced
pre-tax profits at Everest Foods from Pounds 3.31m to Pounds 2.09m in the
year to May 31.
However directors, optimistic about a new line of frozen jacket potatoes,
recommended a modest increase in the final dividend to 2.5p (2.4p) for a
total of 3.7p (3.5p). Earnings per share were almost halved to 5.5p
(10.06p).
'There is now a trend of increasing turnover in all our divisions on
existing products and we view the prospects for our new potato products as
very encouraging,' said Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman.
He added that the first half had been hit by disruption due to the
implementation of the capital expenditure programme and pressure on selling
prices. In the second half demand deteriorated and, coupled with the fire at
Wombourne in April, further affected the performance.
Turnover fell to Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 33.8m). A breakdown of operating
profits showed the frozen chips and related potato products division at
Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 3.03m), egg production Pounds 309,000 (Pounds 396,000)
and specialist food distribution Pounds 175,000 (Pounds 292,000).
The company said trading in frozen foods had seen satisfactory volumes, but
that 'demand for the core frozen chip products became patchy in the second
half'.
Egg production had been reorganised but prices were still below the
industry's average production costs.
The specialist foods distribution division was exposed to the recession.
However, Mr Gilbert said: 'A new management team has been installed during
the second part of the year, with the express brief to increase future
profitability.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson AGB expands 57% to Pounds
1.55m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR NELSON AGB, the largest market research group in the UK, lifted
pre-tax profits by 57 per cent to Pounds 1.55m for the first half of 1993,
compared with Pounds 988,000.
The group became market leader following Taylor Nelson's Pounds 14.5m
acquisition of AGB Research, part of the collapsed Maxwell private empire,
in March last year.
Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive, said the full benefits of the merger were
still ahead. Further cost reductions of Pounds 400,000 are expected in the
second half.
Turnover for the six months rose from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 25.9m.
The pre-tax figure included a Pounds 526,000 share of losses from associates
while last time pre-tax profits included a Pounds 450,000 provision for
property rentals - a problem that has now disappeared.
The associates deficit was a one-off charge reflecting the start-up losses
of the group's joint venture with Information Resources of the US and GfK of
Germany. Known as InfoScan NMRA, the venture will supply market information
to big grocery manufacturers.
The company, which has about 17 per cent of the UK market shared by the top
30 companies, is about the sixth largest in Europe, according to Mr Cowling.
Mr Cowling said that markets holding up well included the retail sector,
where tough trading conditions increased the demand for research, the food
and drink sector, and healthcare.
Generally speaking market research was moving away from the ad hoc
questioning of the past to rolling programmes of research. The company's
strategy would be to build branded services to sell to growing markets.
Mr Cowling cited as an example Optima, which helps clients to assess the
potential for new products. This computer-based product had already doubled
1992 sales to both Europe and the UK.
The company was also seeking new ways of disseminating its information. Next
month it will open a publications division to issue reports based on data
already gathered.
With no debt and cash in hand of Pounds 7.17m, the company was on the look
out for acquisitions. In May this year it paid Pounds 150,000 for Passmore
Marketing Services, a telephone marketing company which would enable the
group to make better use of its telephone system.
Earnings per share rose to 0.47p compared with 0.28p. The interim dividend
is 0.13p (0.1p).

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Alliance to curb propeller loss - British
Aerospace interim results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace is stepping up its efforts to negotiate an alliance with
other European aerospace companies to rationalise its lossmaking turbo
propeller activities.
'Our turbo propeller sector is where the real problem lies in our commercial
aircraft operations,' said yesterday Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive.
These operations, which include production of the Jetstream commuter
aircraft and the Advanced Turbo Prop (ATP) airliner, lost Pounds 60m in the
first half of this year and are likely to incur a similar amount in the
second half.
After negotiating a partnership with Taiwan Aerospace for its lossmaking BAe
146 regional jet business, BAe is now concentrating increasingly in forging
a similar partnership for the turbo propeller business which has been
regrouped at the company's facility at Prestwick in Scotland.
BAe appears to be leaning towards a partnership with the French Aerospatiale
group, Alenia of Italy and Casa of Spain.
Such a partnership would also be open to Deutsche Aerospace and Fokker, the
Dutch manufacturer which has recently come under the control of Deutsche
Aerospace.
However, it seems difficult to see at this stage the German company and
Fokker teaming up with the BAe proposal.
This could ultimately lead to a rationalisation of the European turbo
propeller aircraft industry around two groups: one including BAe,
Aerospatiale, Alenia and Casa and a so-called North European group including
Deutsche Aerospace, Fokker and Saab of Sweden.
Overall, BAe's commercial aircraft activities made a loss before interest of
Pounds 81m in the first half year.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Rover set to make profit after two years of
losses - British Aerospace interim results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER Group, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, would be in
profit for the full year in 1993 after two years of losses, Mr George
Simpson, Rover chairman and BAe deputy chief executive said yesterday.
In the first six months, Rover cut operating loss before interest from
Pounds 31m to Pounds 19m.
The loss included redundancy and restructuring costs of Pounds 22m.
Excluding the one-off rationalisation charge, Rover's trading performance in
the first half improved by Pounds 34m and resulted in a small profit of
Pounds 3m.
Rover expected 'a significant recovery' in its financial performance in the
second half of the year, said Mr Simpson.
Production, which fell by 6.4 per cent to 200,872 in the first half under
the impact of significant stock reductions, was expected to rise in the
second half of the year.
At the same time, the benefits from last year's devaluation of sterling,
which were delayed by currency hedging arrangements, would be fully
reflected in the second half.
The UK car maker's first half performance was impaired by launch costs of
around Pounds 10m for the new Rover 600 executive car, which was introduced
in April. In the second half, Rover would benefit from strong UK sales in
August, when its registrations grew by 23.7 per cent in an overall market,
which rose by 17.8 per cent.
Rover turnover rose by 20.1 per cent in the first half to Pounds 1.98bn
(Pounds 1.65bn).
The group has increased its market share in the UK in the first eight months
of the year to 13 per cent from 12.3 per cent in the corresponding period
last year, and profitability is being helped by an improving 'model mix'
with an increasing proportion of sales coming from its larger Rover cars and
four-wheel drive Land Rover vehicles.
Rover is also performing strongly in continental European markets, albeit
from a small base, despite the steep decline in overall European new car
sales.
In the first six months, Rover and Land Rover worldwide vehicle sales
increased by 13 per cent to 202,100. UK sales rose by 14 per cent to
119,700, while sales in continental Europe rose by 5 per cent to 65,500.
Total sales outside the UK gained 12 per cent to 82,400.
Rover eliminated 1,740 UK jobs in the period with a reduction in the
workforce to 31,398 at the end of June. The UK workforce has been cut
sharply from 40,500 at the end of 1990.
Land Rover however, added 300 jobs during the summer in order to increase
output of its successful Discovery range, and Mr Simpson ruled out further
job cuts in the second half of the year.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook board to take big pay cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Tiphook, the lossmaking container rental company, yesterday
told a highly critical annual meeting that they intended to take pay cuts of
between 25 and 30 per cent this year.
The statement came in response to persistent questions over directors' pay
and contracts, accounting policies and the performance of the
heavily-indebted company's shares, which have fallen from 380p at the
beginning of April to last night's 249p.
One private shareholder asked why, when 'most shareholders have lost a
substantial amount of money on their shares, the directors felt it
appropriate for them to take a large increase in salary?'
His question was greeted with an enthusiastic 'hear, hear' from the
45-strong gathering in London's Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall.
A second shareholder drew attention to the difference in remuneration of
Pounds 4m, including pension payments, for the five executive directors and
less than Pounds 100,000 for the four non-executives.
Tiphook has come under fire recently following revelations that directors
received pay increases in a year when it plunged into net losses of Pounds
66.5m, against a retained profit of Pounds 31.7m in 1992. Mr Robert
Montague, chairman, received a pay rise from Pounds 842,000 to Pounds
851,000.
Mr Montague said the pay issue was being dealt with. 'We do not want to put
ourselves in the position where shareholders were dissatisfied with the
company,' he said.
Mr Rupert Hambro, head of the remuneration committee and recently appointed
deputy chairman, said salaries would be between 25 and 30 per cent lower in
the current year. It is also believed the committee is proposing directors'
contracts of just one year.
Mr Montague was clearly exasperated with shareholders' persistence on the
subject, however, and abruptly asked them to 'leave it and get on' with the
meeting.
Shareholders were also concerned over accounting changes. Tiphook has
previously blamed factors associated with the move to dollar reporting for
the exceptional charges of Pounds 77.3m, resulting in pre-tax losses of
Pounds 21.8m. Mr Montague said the change was due to the strong increase in
US shareholders. About 60 per cent of the group is held in the US.
The critical atmosphere eased somewhat when the chairman, asked to offer his
vision for Tiphook's future, visibly relaxed for the first time in the 90
minute meeting.
Tiphook, the world's number two in container rental, was well placed to grow
in a market estimated to double by the end of the century, he said.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Talks with GEC on naval link - British
Aerospace interim results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is holding discussions with the UK's General Electric
Company to pool the two companies' efforts on future naval programmes.
The talks are aimed in the first instance at collaborative arrangements for
a new generation of air-defence frigates, which Britain currently plans to
develop jointly with France and Italy. A further stage would involve seeking
the prime contractorship for an updated version of the Royal Navy's
Trafalgar class nuclear-powered attack submarine.
The UK share of the Pounds 4bn frigate project is expected to be worth about
Pounds 2.4bn. Under present plans, partner countries would share development
but each would build its own ships.
The UK side would not involve a single prime contractor but separate
contracts for the hull, weapon systems and electronic command system. BAe
and GEC are understood to envisage bidding jointly for all three.
However, Mr John Weston, chairman and managing director of BAe's defence
division, said an overall merger of the two groups' naval businesses was not
under discussion.
BAe, which makes naval weapons and has a 50 per cent interest in the BAeSema
systems company, has ambitions to expand its naval business, both to broaden
its coverage of the defence sector and to break into new markets, especially
in the Far East, reducing its dependence on arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
Exploratory talks on wider defence links with GEC were suspended in July
after press reports suggesting a merger was on the cards. One senior BAe
executive said talks could not be continued 'in the full glare of
publicity'.
BAe is meanwhile pursuing negotiations with Matra of France on pooling
missile interests in a joint venture with combined annual sales of more than
Pounds 1bn. GEC is among other European companies seen as potential future
partners in the venture. Mr Weston said yesterday there was 'definite
interest among other manufactureres to join us.'
Defence continued to be BAe's only significant source of profits in the
first half of this year, offsetting losses in other sectors. Defence profits
before interest and tax dropped to Pounds 230m (Pounds 264m), on sales
reduced to Pounds 1.93bn (Pounds 2.02bn). However,the completion of
deliveries of Hawk trainers to South Korea helped to limit the reduction
that had been anticipated.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Select Industries heads for USM with Pounds
13m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECT Industries is seeking to have all of its issued fully paid ordinary
shares introduced to the USM.
The introduction of the 84.4m such shares at about 8p will value Select at
about Pounds 12.5m. This includes the group's partly paid shares.
Select's main operating subsidiary, AirBoss Ground Engagement, makes a
puncture-proof wheel and tyre system for use in the construction equipment
market.
It has exclusive rights to distribute in Europe, Israel, Turkey and former
Warsaw Pact countries, including Russia.
Mr Edward Vandyk, Select's chief executive, said the group's shares had been
traded under Rule 535 (2) on a matched bargain basis since mid-1991. In
early 1992 various institutions had underwritten a Pounds 5.3m rights issue
and the group had pledged a move to a more senior market when it was
practicable.
A full listing, at any rate only possible after three years' trading, is
planned for January 31 1995. This is when the 143m partly paid shares the
group has issued will become fully paid. These shares of 7.5p are paid as to
2.5p.
The 5p balance is payable in two equal parts on January 31 1994 and January
31 1995. The payments on the partly paid shares - about Pounds 7.1m - will
finance the development and marketing of the range of AirBoss wheel sizes.
Turnover in the first half of 1993 was Pounds 311,000, up 45 per cent on the
corresponding period.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Improving trend at Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEITH Edelman, new chief executive of the Storehouse retailing group,
said yesterday that sales were ahead of last year.
He also announced that the group was setting aside an extra Pounds 6m to
cover the cost of business disposals.
The Pounds 6m provision is thought to relate to loan notes connected with
the sale of Mothercare Stores, the US arm of Mothercare, in 1991. It will be
taken as an exceptional charge against current-year profits.
Mr Edelman, who succeeded Mr David Dworkin as chief executive, said sales at
BhS, Mothercare and Blazer were all ahead of last year in spite of
'intensely competitive trading conditions'. Trading in the 'back-to-school'
period had been encouraging.
He added that Storehouse was still in line for the 'significant improvement'
in trading profits for the full year, which Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman,
forecast at the annual meeting in July.
Sales at BhS were up 5 per cent, with increases spread evenly across all
divisions. Mr Edelman added that operating profits were also on target.
He said margins had been maintained and cost increases had been rigorously
controlled.
Sales at Mothercare were up 4 per cent, but Mr Edelman said margins had been
squeezed by cutting some prices, especially in children's clothing.
Some of the lost margin is expected to be recovered by improvements in the
supply chain over the full year.
At Blazer, the upmarket mens' wear chain, sales were said to be ahead of
last year and in line with budget.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo warns about low price of oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the independent exploration and production company, yesterday
reported net profits of Pounds 20m for the first half of 1993, but warned
that low oil prices were threatening profitability despite the prospect of
steadily rising production.
The interim performance compares with a net loss of Pounds 248m in the same
period last year after a loss of Pounds 291m on the sale of businesses.
Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the company intended to maintain its
present exploration and development programme. He acknowledged, however,
that the company's business plan may have to be modified if oil prices
lingered at or below the Dollars 16 a barrel level until early next year. He
said any such changes would probably involve winding down exploration
expenditure for 1995 and thereafter.
Earnings per share of 2.2p compared with previous losses of 33.5p. The
company is paying a 1.3p (2.3p) interim dividend. The board will recommend a
final of 2p (1p) barring unforeseen circumstances. A scrip alternative will
be offered to shareholders.
The results were generally in line with market expectations and Lasmo shares
closed up 5 1/2 p at 133 1/2 .
Mr Darby confirmed that the company had received offers for its interest in
the Markham field in the North Sea, with analysts suggesting the company
could raise as much as Pounds 100m from a sale. He said additional sales of
peripheral interests could be made in future, although the scale of any
sell-offs would be smaller.
Asset sales combined with planned shutdowns at some fields resulted in lower
production, which fell to 143,100 barrels of oil equivalent compared with
156,100 b/d in the first half of 1992. Turnover was Pounds 309m (Pounds
297m), with some gain recorded from higher sterling prices for oil.
Mr Darby conceded that current low oil prices and a depressed share price
made the company vulnerable to a possible takeover.
'When the oil price is gloomy everybody is nervous,' he said. 'We are not
doing anything to reduce that vulnerability . . . but I'm not sure there is
anybody out there without problems of their own.'
He said the company would focus on increasing production to 220,000 b/d by
1996, a 40 per cent increase over present levels. A key element of that
would be the integrated development of the Liverpool Bay field, which will
supply gas to PowerGen under a contract which is not linked to the oil
price.
Lasmo expects to have medium-term finance in place in the near future to
fund its participation in the field. A decision on whether to go ahead with
the project will be taken by the end of the year, with first production in
1995.
The development programme would keep balance sheet gearing, now at 70 per
cent, steady this year before rising to 80-90 per cent in 1995, after which
the company expects it to fall significantly.
Gearing hit 111 per cent at the end of last year but fell after the company
raised Dollars 600m in the US early this year. Net debt fell to Pounds 781m
at the half-year from Pounds 1.08bn at year end.
Another strand of Lasmo's strategy is to cut costs. Cost of sales, including
operating costs, depletion charges and production taxes, is expected to be
close to Pounds 9 a barrel in 1993.
Costs, which Mr Darby said have been too high, are likely to fall as Lasmo's
activities change. New developments, such as Liverpool Bay, involve lower
costs than many of its existing assets.
Administrative costs have been cut by 20 per cent, with another 20 per cent
cut envisaged in 1994.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Savoy loss unchanged at Pounds 1.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVOY HOTEL announced an unchanged first half pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.75m
and said it had not benefited from the improvement in the economy or from
last September's devaluation of sterling, writes Michael Skapinker
The loss for the six months to June 30 was on turnover up 3 per cent to
Pounds 37.8m. The group, whose hotels include the Savoy, the Connaught and
Claridge's, said its operating costs rose 3.5 per cent to Pounds 36m,
largely due to an increase in sales and marketing expenditure.
Mr Giles Shepard, managing director, said: 'Despite certain aspects of the
economy improving, such improvements as there were did not benefit the
company, nor were the effects of last September's devaluation of sterling
reflected in an increasing number of foreign visitors to our hotels and
restaurants.'
The group's pre-tax loss was limited by an increase in investment income
from Pounds 68,000 to Pounds 587,000. This included a Pounds 555,000 profit
on the sale of the Savoy Theatre's investment portfolio. At the trading
level, the loss increased to Pounds 1.6m Pounds 1.15m.
Losses were 4p (3.5p) per A share and 2p (1.7p) per B share.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Germans to take 26.5% stake in Jones &amp;
Shipman

KORBER, a secretive German group best known for its Hauni cigarette
manufacturing machinery, is to take a 26.5 per cent stake in Jones &amp;
Shipman, the lossmaking maker of grinding and honing machines.
The deal, along with a placing and open offer of new shares, will raise
Pounds 2.96m for J&amp;S, and is crucial to the survival of one of the most
famous names in the UK machine tool industry.
J&amp;S said shareholders should be aware that if its proposals were not
implemented 'the group may have insufficient working capital facilities to
continue trading'.
The transaction with Korber, under discussion for the past 18 months, opens
the way for Leicester-based J&amp;S to announce its delayed results for the year
ended March 31.
The company reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 7.35m)
on turnover down from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 13.4m for the year. Losses per
share were cut to 12.7p (56.1p). No dividend is recommended.
The share stake is intended to cement a co-operation agreement between J&amp;S
and Korber's two grinding machine companies, Blohm and Schaudt.
Mr John Wareing, Jones &amp; Shipman's managing director, said the deal would
help J&amp;S develop its business. Its new German partners will sell J&amp;S
machines in Germany, where the UK company's presence has always been weak.
J&amp;S in turn will sell Blohm machines in the UK, but not Schaudt machines for
contractual reasons.
The Pounds 1.63m from Korber is to be raised through the subscription by the
German group for 6.81m new shares at 24p each, a further Pounds 1.61m is to
be raised through the placing by Close Brothers of 6.7m new shares at the
same price.
The deal will allow J&amp;S to complete its restructuring programme, which is
based on contracting out most of its machining work.

FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Polly Pocket and Mighty Max lift Bluebird
Toys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEAR doubling of foreign sales helped Bluebird Toys lift pre-tax profits
from Pounds 234,000 to Pounds 1.99m in the six months to June 30.
The strong performance abroad reflected the ongoing success of its 'Polly
Pocket' range of miniature dolls, now in its fourth year, and the successful
launch of 'Mighty Max' which has been very well received in all markets,
said Mr Torquil Norman, Bluebird's chairman.
The depreciation of sterling against the US and Hong Kong dollars also
contributed to the increase. Conditions in the home markets remained
subdued.
'We have made an excellent start to the year and we look forward to
continued growth in the second half as well as a good result for 1993 as a
whole,' he said.
Mr Norman said the higher volume of overseas sales would change the seasonal
distribution of profits, tending to reduce the traditional bias towards the
second half.
Turnover rose to Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 17.4m) with overseas sales increasing
to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 8.68m). The company said a broader spectrum of
international markets gave it a measure of stability while consulting
distributors on design had helped secure orders.
Inventories are down to Pounds 4.97m (Pounds 6.91m) Bluebird expects to
exceed last year's Pounds 6.39m cash balance at December 31. Net interest
charges fell to Pounds 591,000 (Pounds 962,000).
The company does not pay an interim dividend and earnings per share climbed
to 14.7p (4.2p).

FT  16 SEP 93 / Air France to shed 4,000 jobs in FFr5bn cost-cutting plan:
Attempt to stem mounting losses leads to second set of crisis measures
involving suspension of destinations and disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE, the French state-owned airline, yesterday announced a FFr5bn
(Pounds 560m) cost-cutting package, including the loss of 4,000 jobs by the
end of 1994. The plan is an attempt to stem mounting losses that the company
said had more than doubled to FFr3.8bn in the first half of this year.
The package, Air France's second set of crisis measures in the past two
years, also involves the suspension of about 15 of the airline's 203
destinations, the sale of part of the group's 57 per cent stake in the
Meridien hotels chain, and the disposal of its Saresco duty-free shops.
The French airline also plans to bring other shareholders into its Servair
catering subsidiary and to maintain a wage freeze.
Air France, which is under strong pressure from the French state to reduce
its losses, said the plan should enable it to return to profit in 1995. The
group declined to forecast its losses for this year. But in an interview in
yesterday's Le Monde newspaper, Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport
minister, forecast a net loss of FFr5.5bn for the year, a sharp increase
over last year's FFr3.2bn deficit.
Mr Bernard Attali, Air France's chairman, said the company's financial
position had left it with no choice in implementing further cost-cutting
measures and that it had to 're-centre' its activities.
A spokesman for Air France said the airline had been particularly badly
affected by the recession in France and Germany and that it was less
competitive than international rivals because it had been late in
implementing cost-cutting programmes.
The measures announced yesterday are aimed at reducing expenditure by about
19 per cent between now and 1995, with most of the savings coming this year.
The 4,000 job cuts, which come on top of a programme to cut 4,600 jobs
between 1991 and the end of this year, will comprise 3,000 ground staff and
1,000 navigation staff.
By 1995 Air France will have about 39,000 employees, about one-fifth fewer
than at the beginning of 1991.
Air France said it would minimise the number of involuntary redundancies,
but the plan has run into resistance from trade unions. 'It is necessary to
fight this plan, not to negotiate,' the company's central union committee
said.
Mr Bosson said that 'redressing the financial situation of the company was a
priority', and that this would have to be done before the group was
privatised. Air France is one of the 21 state-owned groups that the
government plans to privatise.
The transport minister said the government 'would do its duty as a
shareholder', but industry ministry officials declined to say how much
financial support would be made available to the airline.
The destinations to be suspended are likely to include Kuala Lumpur, Lusaka
and some routes to northern Africa. The closing of such destinations, the
company said, would allow it to concentrate resources on more profitable
routes.
According to Mr Attali, there are some encouraging signs. The airlines'
passenger traffic has been increasing since May. But in spite of this, he
said, 'the current difficulties of Air France are far from being resolved'.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Nomura lures banking sector team from Smith New Court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INDICATIONS of a revival in employment prospects in the London stock market
were emphasised yesterday by confirmation that Nomura's European division
has successfully lured the highly valued banking sector research team away
from Smith New Court.
Mr Michael Lever, former head of the Smith New Court team, is joining Nomura
on terms reported to be worth around Pounds 300,000 a year.
Mr Lever would not discuss his overall package yesterday, commenting that
many elements, including mortgages, and cars can be involved.
Also signing for Nomura yesterday was Mr David Raye, Mr Lever's second in
command at Smith New Court.
Earlier this year, Nomura had similar success in recruiting Smith's oils
team.
Both moves have been seen as evidence of renewed confidence towards its
London operation by Nomura which had previously cut back on its UK
operation.
The Nomura appointments provide further indication of a strong recovery in
recruitment policies in the City of London, at least for provenly able
staff. Mr Lever was rated second in this year's Extel survey of City
analysts, and first by the banks themselves.
He spent nine years with the Bank of England, and thus joins several other
ex-Bank specialists to have joined stock market firms.
Among them are Mr Ian Harnett, chief economist at Strauss Turnbull, UK arm
of Societe Generale, and Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort
Benson.
There were also reports yesterday of attempts to preserve the stock market
existence of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the UK stockbroking firm which was
largely closed down last week by its French parent, Banque Indosuez.

FT  16 SEP 93 / ECC blames lower results on competition in kaolin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH China Clays, the industrial minerals and construction materials
group, yesterday reported slightly lower first-half profits, which it blamed
on lower margins and fierce competition in its core kaolin business.
The decline in pre-tax profits, which slipped to Pounds 40.3m in the six
months to June 30 from an adjusted Pounds 40.8m a year earlier, disappointed
the markets and fuelled a 26p fall in the group's share price to 408p.
At the end of June the group acquired the Calgon speciality chemical
business in the US for Pounds 209.7m. It has also announced plans to demerge
its construction materials division - a move expected to take place in the
first half of 1994.
Earnings per share declined to 9.85p from 10.02p a year earlier, but the
interim dividend is unchanged at 6.6p.
Turnover increased by 7.4 per cent to Pounds 515.1m (Pounds 479.4m), and the
group managed to increase operating profits to Pounds 47.8m (Pounds 41m)
although Pounds 4m of the improvement was attributable to currency
movements.
Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said trading conditions had remained
difficult in industrial minerals markets, particularly in the European paper
and ceramics industries, which are both important markets for china clay.
The core ECC international operations reported operating profits of Pounds
38.1m, down sharply from Pounds 47.6m in the 1992 first half in spite of an
overall 2 per cent rise in sales volumes of industrial minerals.
The lower profits reflected a decline in margins as the group was forced to
abandon its 'robust' pricing policy in the face of price and cost pressures.
Operating profits in the construction materials division fell to Pounds 6.2m
(Pounds 8.4m). In Europe sales volumes of aggregates fell 7 per cent mainly
reflecting the ending of large contracts in the UK south-west.
The group has been running down its UK housing operations and completed the
sale of 97 new houses in the first half, with 104 homes remaining at the end
of June. Proceeds from land sales were Pounds 13.2m, significantly up on
last year, and contributed to operating profits of Pounds 6.6m. Net interest
expense of Pounds 7.8m was sharply higher than the Pounds 600,000 reported
in the 1992 first half.

FT  16 SEP 93 / CSFB plans compensation scheme to unite company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston, the investment banking arm of Switzerland's CS Holding, is
developing a company-wide compensation scheme as part of its efforts to meld
into a single global investment bank.
Compensation has been a controversial subject at the firm, which operated
until recently as three separate regional entities tied together with
revenue-sharing agreements.
Last week the company adopted a single name worldwide. A new slogan, 'One
Firm, One Name, One Mission', is intended to symbolise an end to the
regional tensions that have hampered profitability.
Mr Alan Wheat, chief operating officer, said that the new compensation
system might not be in place until next year. 'Measurement systems in this
company are not what you would want them to be,' he said, adding that not
all the issues surround-ing compensation had been resolved.
He said completion of the new arrangements might cause some further
departures from the company, which suffered a number of well-publicised
defections earlier this year. 'I think there are other people who may well
leave,' Mr Wheat said.
Mr Wheat's predecessor, Mr Archibald Cox, resigned in July after a string of
top New York investment bankers left the firm. The departed bankers were
unhappy that their annual bonuses last year were low because of the poor
performance of the company's European and Asian operations.
Mr David Mulford, who heads the company's worldwide investment banking
division and chairs its European operations, said the previous emphasis on
the performance of various geographic regions stymied the firm's ability to
promote its products worldwide.
For instance, the investment bank had complex inter-group agreements for
dividing profits among various geographical regions that contributed to,
say, an international equity offering.
'Even I couldn't understand these agreements,' Mr Wheat said. Moreover, the
fact that regions competed for business separately often meant they competed
against each other.
'We often had two teams, two groups, who would bump into each other in the
hallway while making a presentation,' he said.
Of the geographical regions likely to require the greatest change, Mr Wheat
said the US, where 4,000 of the firm's 6,000 employees are based, would be
the priority.

FT  16 SEP 93 / BAe disappoints with Pounds 20m move into the black: Market
surprised by high debt charges and turboprop losses - Analysts lower
full-year estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace yesterday returned to profit after one of the most
turbulent periods in its history.
The company, Britain's biggest exporter of manufactured goods, reported a
Pounds 20m pre-tax profit for the first half of this year compared with a
Pounds 129m loss in the same period last year.
But the turnround disappointed the stock market which was surprised by the
company's high interest costs and continuing heavy losses in BAe's
turbopropeller regional and commuter aircraft activities.
BAe's shares closed 26p lower at 394p as analysts lowered estimates for the
company's full-year profits from a range of Pounds 100m-Pounds 150m to a
range of Pounds 60m-Pounds 90m.
'The process of recovery appears to be taking longer than we expected,' one
analyst said.
Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman, said the company was continuing to put the
emphasis on cash generation and cost reduction to boost longer term
profit-ability.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, also confirmed the company's efforts to
pursue a series of strategic partnerships at the same time as disposing of
non-core businesses.
After negotiating a partnership with Taiwan Aerospace for its regional jet
operations, BAe is now seeking partners for its turbopropeller commuter
aircraft business which lost Pounds 60m in the first half.
Mr Evans said talks to merge BAe's guided missiles business with those of
the French Matra group were making good progress.
The company is also engaged in co-operation and possible sale talks, with
the Dutch Boskalis group, for its Dutch construction subsidiary, Ballast
Nedam. It is also considering selling some property assets to generate
additional cash.
BAe's core defence activities continued to show a strong performance with
interim operating profits of Pounds 230m, down from Pounds 264m a year
earlier on sales of Pounds 1.93bn, down from Pounds 2.02bn.
Defence activities have been underpinned by the confirmation this year of an
additional order for Tornado aircraft from Saudi Arabia.
Commercial aircraft activities reduced their losses to Pounds 81m from
Pounds 286m in the same period last year, but the company warned that the
turbopropeller sector was continuing to incur losses.
BAe's Rover car subsidiary reduced its first-half losses to Pounds 19m from
Pounds 31m in a recovery fuelled by good sales performance in both the UK
market and in continental Europe against the general trend. Rover is
expected to be in profit for the full year.
Overall, BAe first-half sales rose to Pounds 5.07bn from Pounds 4.63bn.
The dividend was increased to 3.3p from 3p. Earnings per share were 4.2p,
compared with a loss of 35p.
BAe said a much reduced seasonal first-half operating cash outflow meant
that net debt increased by Pounds 464m during the first half to Pounds 721m.
An increase to Pounds 91m in first-half interest charges from Pounds 62m the
year before reflected in large part the lower interest earned on the
company's cash deposits compared with the interest paid on its fixed debt.

FT  16 SEP 93 / MGN recovery clears way to early sale of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG recovery in profits at Mirror Group Newspapers has cleared the way
for an early disposal of the 54.8 per cent stake in MGN held by
administrators controlling the collapsed Maxwell private empire.
MGN shares rose 8p to 186p after the company reported that pre-tax profits
shot up from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 69.9m in the six months to June 27.
Trading profits, which it said reflected increased revenues and reduced
costs, climbed 16 per cent to Pounds 57.3m.
Mr David Montgomery, MGN chief executive, said the circulation of the Daily
Mirror and Scotland's Daily Record had not been hurt by News Corporation's
rival tabloid, The Sun, which since July has been undercutting its MGN
rivals by 7p per copy.
Mr Montgomery said the Daily Mirror's circulation rose 65,000 in August,
although it was too early to predict the outcome of the newspaper price war.
Advertising revenues rose 6.5 per cent, helping group turnover rise 1 per
cent to Pounds 237.2m. Reductions in staff and efficiency benefits had cut
costs by Pounds 4m in the first half and would produce annualised savings of
Pounds 17m, which might be partly offset by increased costs in other areas.
Staff numbers had fallen from 3,601 to 2,998 in the half-year and would be
down to 2,850 by the year-end. Mr Montgomery said a new culture had been
established and 'defiant' elements in management and workforce had been
removed.
Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, who is joint administrator to the private
Maxwell companies, declined to comment on rumours that the stake of 200m
shares would be placed soon. Mr Montgomery said there had been no sign of
any single buyer for the stake.
He hoped it would find a home with institutions, which would allow editorial
independence. But any decision on the stake was up to the administrator.
Pre-tax profit before exceptionals rose from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 33.8m.
Exceptional credits, as the company adjusted Maxwell-related provisions,
totalled Pounds 36.1m. The company expects to begin paying dividends again
next year.
The exceptional gains included a release of Pounds 30m against provisions
for pensions, less Pounds 10m of deferred tax. There was another release of
Pounds 9.5m in provisions for restructuring charges. That was offset by a
charge of Pounds 10.7m to cover the costs of shifting the company's
headquarters from Holborn Circus to Canary Wharf.
The proposed settlement with private Maxwell companies brought a Pounds
15.2m release, and another Pounds 11.4m in provisions was set aside to cover
other London leasehold properties. The deal with the private Maxwell
companies diminished MGN's tax charge for the half by Pounds 4.1m to Pounds
17.9m, compared with Pounds 5.3m last time. Earnings per share rose to 13p
(from 2.6p), although the underlying figure, minus exceptionals, was 6.4p
(against 2.6p).

FT  16 SEP 93 / Lamont delivers attack on Major's leadership: Ex-chancellor
backs rightwing opposition to tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the former chancellor, yesterday delivered a wide-ranging
attack on government policy, calculated to weaken Mr John Major's hold on
Downing Street.
Mr Lamont, who was sacked by Mr Major in May, challenged the prime minister
to rule out British participation in European monetary union, endorsed
rightwing opposition to tax increases, and questioned in scarcely coded
language Mr Major's leadership.
He said Britain's ignominious withdrawal from the European exchange rate
mechanism a year ago today had accelerated economic recovery.
But, writing in The Sun, he warned: 'Instead of talking about tax increases,
the government should be looking at spending cuts.' He added: 'Given the
right leadership, the British people could equal the best in the world.'
Mr Lamont's intervention will encourage rightwing Conservative critics of Mr
Major, and could help trigger a leadership challenge this year.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, a consistent critic, said a challenger might emerge in
November unless Mr Major mobilises support at next month's party conference.
Mrs Gorman said Conservative MPs 'must not get bogged down with the idea
that this is an honest man, and therefore impregnable'.
In his Sun article, Mr Lamont warns that, 'unbelievably', plans for monetary
union are being revived by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission.
'Fortunately, there is now no ERM for us to rejoin, and there is not likely
to be for some time. What better time for the prime minister to stand up and
say once and for all that Britain should never again have anything to do
with a single currency,' he says.
Mr Lamont urges Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to bow to rightwing calls
to re-open cabinet talks on next year's public spending and drop his
insistence that tax increases remain an option in the November Budget.
In an article in The Times, also published today, Mr Lamont says he
considered resigning when Britain was forced out of the ERM, but was
dissuaded by Mr Major. 'Had I known he would change his mind as he did, I
would have done so,' he says.
Mr Lamont says the withdrawal was 'a humiliation for the government, the
prime minister and myself'. But he says the government's desire to be 'at
the heart of Europe' was an obstacle to voluntary withdrawal.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Florida struggles to limit damage to tourist industry
</HEADLINE>

FLORIDA was yesterday scrambling to limit the damage to its biggest-earning
industry, tourism, after the killing of a British holidaymaker on Tuesday.
The state government ordered police to guard rest areas off main highways 24
hours a day and to patrol trunk roads. It also set up a free telephone
number for tourist safety tips, and asked for Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) of
emergency federal aid to pay for police surveillance around Miami.
The police search for the killers of Mr Gary Colley, murdered outside
Tallahassee in northern Florida, intensified yesterday. Police found the
getaway car in Monticello, near Tallahassee. They believe the killers are
still in the area and are rounding up teenagers who fit the description.
Mr Colley was the ninth foreigner to be killed in the state in the past
year, and his murder came less than a week after a German tourist was shot
outside Miami airport.
Mr Uwe-Wilhelm Rakebrand and his pregnant wife were driving their rented car
when it was hit from behind. The tourists drove on, but assailants opened
fire from their car, killing the 33-year-old German.
Travellers arriving at Miami airport at night are advised to stay in hotels
close by, and those who rent a car and take the road from the airport to
Miami Beach are given detailed instructions on how to arrive safely.
The Avis rental agency has large signs inside its cars advising drivers not
to stop on the way from the airport under any circumstances, especially if
bumped from behind.
Mr Greg Farmer, state commerce secretary, said about 25 per cent of European
package bookings were now being cancelled. 'There is no question that the
European market will be affected,' said Mr Mayco Villafana, of the Miami
Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.
The Florida tourism industry is worth about Dollars 31bn a year, employs
about 650,000 people - 12.4 per cent of the non-farm workforce  - and is the
state's largest industry.
About 40m tourists visit Florida every year, 17 per cent of them from
abroad.
Florida has the worst violent crime rates in the US, slightly ahead of New
York, though crime rates have recently fallen.
Dr John Crotts, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, says an
out-of-state visitor has a 91 in a 100,000 chance of becoming a victim of
crime - better odds than for Honolulu in the 1980s.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Factories' unit labour costs head for historic yearly fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAY bill in manufacturing industry has not grown at all this year and
British manufacturing is heading for a reduction in unit labour costs in
1993 for the first time since 1960, the Confederation of British Industry
said yesterday.
Providing timely backing for the government's freeze on public sector pay
bills next year, announced on Tuesday, the CBI also said that recovery was
not bringing a bounce-back in manufacturing pay settlements and that pay
freezes remained common. Settlements averaged 2.3 per cent in the second
quarter of the year compared with 4 per cent one year earlier.
The CBI said prices and employment prospects were now a downward pressure on
pay. Its latest survey shows that 60 per cent of employees do not expect a
higher pay rise next year.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said the public sector squeeze for
1994-95 would help reduce private sector expectations. The current year's
1.5 per cent public sector limit had helped take one percentage point off
private sector settlements.
An average reduction of 3 per cent in the first half of this year, combined
with the continuing low level of pay rises, virtually ensures the first
negative figure for the whole year for more than 30 years. The current
position is superior to that in Germany, France, Japan and the US.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said: 'Experience in the US has shown that
it is possible to keep unit labour costs falling even in a recovery phase.'
Economists say it is normal to achieve productivity gains in the first phase
of an upturn as output picks up while the workforce remains static. But the
CBI said that this upturn was not being accompanied by a sharp rise in
hourly labour costs.
There is, however, some evidence that the reduction in pay settlements is
bottoming out. The latest survey to show a slight increase in the last
quarter - from an average increase of 2.09 per cent to 2.49 per cent - comes
from the Engineering Employers Federation.
Employment in manufacturing has been static since December 1992 at 4.2m.
Companies were using more overtime and more part-timers, while the use of
performance-related pay had spread, the CBI said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It took expectations of strong earnings growth and lower gilt yields to
drive UK equities to their recent peaks. Now these assumptions have been
called into question on both fronts. Disappointing results from English
China Clays and British Aerospace suggest earnings hopes have run ahead of
reality, while bond markets in the UK and the US are suffering a bout of
inflation jitters. It is dangerous to read too much into one month's price
data, but the risk to the virtuous circle is particularly acute in the UK.
If world bond markets lose their nerve, the government's deficit will become
much harder to finance. Gilt market weakness would be quickly transmitted to
equities as well as the exchange rate. One must hope this morning's PSBR
number is not another nasty surprise.

FT  16 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo is putting a brave face on it, but there is no disguising its distress
at the current oil price. Without its Pounds 13m exceptional provision
release, operating profit would have been flat in the first half. Since then
the oil price has fallen further.
Lasmo prefers to look at cash flow, since its profits are depressed by the
high depreciation charge on assets - such as Piper - for which it overpaid
in the past. Even on this basis, though, it looks squeezed. Its projections
assume an oil price around Dollars 19 next year. If the price stays around
Dollars 16, cash flow will suffer to the tune of around Pounds 60m,
equivalent to its entire exploration budget for next year.
There is little scope for further savings, but it is hard to believe Lasmo
would be prepared instead to jeopardise its future by abandoning the search
for replacement assets. A more rational approach, if the going remains
tough, would be to recapitalise with a rights issue that would allow
expensive older assets to be sold off at a loss. Doubtless Lasmo hopes it
will not come to that - not least because its promise to maintain a dividend
it cannot really afford would then look doubly rash.

FT  16 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: English China Clays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all its ambition in speciality chemicals, English China Clays is
shackled to the business its name describes. Yet supplying kaolin to paper
makers is thankless when the industry is blighted by recession and
over-capacity. Since many ECC customers are in countries with weak
currencies, even sterling's exit from the ERM brought scant relief. The
bleak message is that attempts to hold the line on pricing have been
abandoned. Margin benefits from earlier rounds of rationalisation have been
lost.
While that justifies ECC's decision to look for growth elsewhere, the
commitment to pay an unchanged dividend which accompanied June's rights
issue now looks a burden. Sales of surplus land underpin the cash cost of
the pay-out, but it may not be covered by earnings. The picture is worse if
profits from disposals and building materials, which is to be demerged, are
stripped out.
Demerger might get ECC out of a tight spot, as it did for ICI. Loading
building materials with more than its fair share of the dividend would
provide relief for the parent without loss of face. But that relies on a
recovery in aggregates, which is far from evident. The gamble then is that
ECC can buy or conjure earnings growth before the cracks start to show.

FT  16 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More good news from Mirror Group Newspapers must surely have convinced the
administrator to press ahead with the sale of his 54.8 per cent stake. The
rosy aura surrounding MGN after its half-year results produced another jump
in the shares despite the market's fraying nerves. MGN's trading margin has
increased by more than 3 percentage points to 24.2 per cent. Advertising
revenue has climbed 6.4 per cent. The pension fund drain is proving less
than feared. Even The Sun's price assault has failed to dull the shine. All
this should provide an attractive backdrop for an institutional placing.
However, unanswered concerns remain about MGN's longer-term prospects. If
extended, the 7p price differential between The Sun and Daily Mirror must
surely tell over time. Any imposition of VAT on newspapers will further
exacerbate the strain. As it was, MGN's cover-price revenue fell
fractionally to Pounds 150m in the half-year. Impressive though they are,
recent improvements may not alter a trend which has seen Daily Mirror
circulation fall 40 per cent in the past 30 years. Once the recovery
momentum exhausts itself, investors will look to yield to underpin the
shares. But gearing of 85 per cent will permit no more than a modest
dividend next year.

Since British Aerospace's figures are the balance of such large flows,
forecasting its results is a hazardous business. Nonetheless, even modestly
disappointing surprises can unsettle a market still shell-shocked by the
upheavals of the past two years. A high interest charge and the poor
performance of commercial aircraft operations were perhaps there to be seen,
but there is understandable nervousness from those who missed the trick.
That the company's profitability is proving as slow and difficult to repair
as initially indicated shows what a tangled mess it had become under the old
regime.
Still, knots are slowly being unpicked, and the new corporate structure and
credit facilities provide a solid basis for progress. Cash inflow from
operations, property disposals and the sale of corporate jet activities will
cut borrowings in the second half. There may also be a Pounds 180m inflow if
Ballast Nedam is sold.
Other deals could follow. The saga of regional jets and Taiwan Aerospace may
yet reach a happy conclusion, though since BAe can now afford to walk away
there must be a limit to its patience. Aerospatiale may prove a suitable
partner for turboprop aircraft and negotiations with Matra continue on the
missiles business. Talks with GEC were stopped, however, presumably for fear
of frightening the banks at a critical stage of the refinancing. The company
has not ruled out future discussions, which may be unwise since
long-suffering shareholders who have a glimpse of better times can prove
just as skittish as banks.

Andre Szasz, the seasoned No 2 at the Dutch Central Bank, was in urbane form
at a City conference in London yesterday, a gathering which was engaged in
examining the EC's exchange rate mechanism one year after sterling's rapid
departure.
Stoutly defending Bundesbank-style orthodoxy, Szasz expressed support for
those ERM members who have not used their new-found monetary flexibility to
bring down interest rates faster since August's exchange rate jitters.
Signs during the summer that some countries were 'impatient' to lower
interest rates themselves contributed to the speculative flurries against
weaker ERM members, Szasz said.
His comment was taken by some as a direct criticism of Edmond Alphandery;
the French economy minister's call in June for Bundesbank interest rate cuts
almost immediately sparked pressure on the French franc.
Pressed for elucidation, the Delphic Szasz said he would 'never presume' to
give Alphandery any advice. Any similarity between persons criticised in his
speech and what he called 'living characters' was 'purely coincidental'.

David Montgomery, the Ulsterman who moved from Rupert Murdoch's News
International stable to take over as chief executive of Mirror Group
Newspapers, is keen to persuade the City that readers of the group's
newspapers have an affluence far removed from that of the cloth-capped image
of old.
Yesterday he reeled off statistics to make an advertising sales rep
salivate: more than half of Daily Mirror readers now take overseas holidays;
63 per cent have mortgages; 48 per cent come from households with two cars.
Montgomery repeated his intention of maintaining the Mirror's left-wing
political allegiance. But an economic transformation is a different matter:
'Our readers have moved on in a way that was not recognised in the recent
past,' he says.

Britain's Conservative Euro-sceptics who warned of a transfer of power away
from the UK if the Maastricht bill was approved are apparently being proved
right.
First Edwina Currie, a former Tory health minister, and Tony Banks, Labour's
chirpiest London MP, announced plans to stand for the European parliament.
Now Tony Speller, the Conservative who lost North Devon to the Liberal
Democrats by a wafer in 1992, says he is looking for a Strasbourg seat.
Speller, an MP for 13 years, says the centre of political debate is shifting
to Europe. He reckons Westminster will end up as little more than a training
ground for aspirant Euro MPs.
It used to be so different. Ann Clwyd, a defeated 1992 candidate for
Labour's deputy leadership, is one of many MPs from both sides of the
Commons who cut her political teeth in Strasbourg, and then took the first
chance to shift to London.
The complaint then was that the European assembly lacked real power. But
Banks and co are clearly betting that future political leaders are more
likely to emerge from Strasbourg than Westminster. What price president
Currie?

Probably the only mystery left in crime fiction is why so many of its most
successful practitioners are women.
'It's simple really - women generally don't have direct power over events
and people in their lives. So they kill people in print instead,' says Janet
Cohen, 53, corporate finance director of Charterhouse bank, whose fourth
venture into crime writing, Death among the Dons, has just been shortlisted
for the prestigious Crime Writers' Association Golden Dagger awards.
A qualified solicitor, she writes crime novels under the name Janet Neel.
Her experience of fiction goes way back to 1966, when she spent time
designing 'human player simulations' - war games - for the US defence
department, then busily trying to second-guess the north Vietnamese army.
'I found I could win the games more easily as a guerrilla than a politician
 -just like being in a merchant bank,' she says.

Back among the bougainvillaeas in sleepy Tunis, Yassir Arafat is probably
soaking his right hand in some soothingly cool water.
After an enforced absence of 19 years from the US, he made up for lost time.
Straight off the aircraft on Sunday he went into conversations with
ex-presidents Bush and Carter, followed by a meeting with Jesse Jackson.
Monday he breakfasted at the World Bank with Jacques Delors. From thence to
the signing ceremony - and more handshakes - on the White House lawn,
followed by a visit to Foggy Bottom for a chat with Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state. The day concluded amid a welter of prime-time TV
interviews.
That punishing schedule was enough to slow the strongest; but Tuesday showed
Arafat as vigorous as ever. Breakfast on Capitol Hill; lunch downtown at the
National Press Club; a tete a tete with UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros
Ghali; back on a flight to Tunis. Implementing a peace agreement should be
easy after all that.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Economic Viewpoint: What lies beyond anti-inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nearly always some paradox about the world or national economy
which prevents the subject from being unbearably repetitive or dull. This
time it is that forward-looking financial market indicators point to healthy
growth. On the other hand most direct measures of activity show a very
inadequate recovery from a severe recession with unprecedented amounts of
slack remaining. Whatever today's UK unemployment figures show, the
depressing trends in the rest of the world cast a cloud.
In terms of equities, there has been a sharp contrast between Anglo-US
experience, on the one hand, and German and Japanese on the other. In the
US, equity prices have not merely risen sharply this year but are now nearly
40 per cent higher than at the peak reached before the 1987 Wall Street
crash; in the UK equities are a good 20 per cent higher. German and Japanese
equities have been depressed by the economic difficulties of the two
countries. They have, however, seen limited local recoveries.
Dividend yields in the two main English-speaking countries have been heading
strongly downwards. But they are still above or around the low points they
reached before the 1987 crash. The fall in bond yields has gone even further
than the fall in equity yields and the yield gap has narrowed strikingly.
The equity rise, so far at least, can be explained as a normal response to
falling interest rates.
The fall in bond yields does not in itself suggest prolonged depression. It
does suggest that the inflationary pressures of recent years have been truly
subdued, although not eliminated, as the unsurprising UK Retail Prices Index
data remind us. The one available direct measure of inflationary
expectations is the gap between the yield on UK nominal gilt-edged
securities and that on indexed bonds. This has also fallen sharply, but is
still 3 1/2 per cent, which suggests something like the creeping inflation
experienced in the postwar golden age.
Some of the evidence for the degree of slack remaining in the world economy
has been collected by Mervyn King, economic director of the Bank of England,
in his recent presidential lecture to the European Economic Association. He
shows that personal consumption in the US has been 4 per cent below what is
normal at this stage of the business cycle. In the UK, the shortfall has
been 8 per cent.
King's own explanation is in terms of debt deflation. The slogan is, of
course, well known, but King explains the phenomenon more carefully than
most. He defines the necessary condition for debt deflation as 'a fall in
asset values relative to the unit of account in which debts are
denominated'. Thus, there can be debt deflation in a world where general
price indices are still rising, as well as in periods such as the 1930s when
they were falling and the US economist, Irving Fisher, identified the
problem.
The real value of net private sector debt rose in the UK by nearly 7 per
cent in 1989-92. This was not nearly as much as in the US in 1929-32 but
has, nevertheless, been a severe shock. King finds a reasonably good fit
between increases in the household debt ratio and the shortfall in consumer
spending in 1989-92 in various countries.
The main new element he contributes is an analysis of the distribution of
the debt between sectors. For instance, the fall in consumer spending in
Britain has been confined to households with mortgages. The behaviour of
house prices varied widely from region to region. The biggest fall of nearly
30 per cent has been in the south. In the north, Scotland and Wales, house
prices are now higher than in 1989. Not surprisingly, negative equity has
been concentrated in the south and hardly exists further away. An associated
phenomenon has been the sharp narrowing of unemployment differentials, as
the normally prosperous south-east was affected far more by recession than
the previously depressed areas.
King does not stick his neck out by saying whether the dragging effect of
high debt levels on spending will continue to hold back recovery, or whether
the more encouraging stock and bond market indicators provide a better clue.
But the proverbial editorial ending, 'only time will tell', will not do. For
we have reached a period in the international conjuncture where
macroeconomic policy can no longer be seen just in terms of fighting
inflation. It is typical of our cultural lags that just when inflation is at
its least threatening for more than a generation that the UK government has
only an inflation target and no other macroeconomic objective at all. The
Bank of England Bulletin has only an Inflation Report and has abandoned its
commentary on the general economy, which now has to be read between the
lines of the Inflation Report.
An indicator which combines real output and inflation in a useful way is
total spending, measured by the growth of nominal gross domestic product. In
the Group of Seven summit countries combined, nominal GDP growth was down to
3 1/2 per cent in the year to the middle of 1993. Inflation was down to 2
1/2 per cent, leaving only 1 per cent for real growth - all of which was
accounted for by the US, UK and Canada. If we regard the prevailing
international inflation rate as not far from the levels at which public
national authorities should be aiming, and take the trend rate of real
growth to be about 3 per cent a year, then the growth of demand in cash
terms has been too low.
At least the old simple-minded monetarism was theoretically a bulwark
against depression as well as inflation. This was so because of the
relationship it asserted between chosen measures of money and nominal GNP.
The relationship meant that if inflation declined output would automatically
recover, so long as the monetary targets held.
The collapse of confidence in this relationship does not mean that policy
need be helpless. But it does mean that governments and central banks cannot
just have an objective for inflation alone, but need one for nominal GDP.
Any busy business executives, who are thrown by the words 'nominal GDP' can
best translate it as a national - or international - cash-flow objective.
The need for such a cash objective is one that I have been trying to hammer
home for nearly a decade and a half, as a way of saving the valid insights
of both monetarism and Keynesianism from their misleading technocratic
wrappings. Nominal GDP objectives would be sought through ordinary monetary
and fiscal policy. No black magic is required or available. Framing policy
in such cash-flow terms would liberate monetary authorities in relation to
means, but tie their hands on ends.
The main evolution in my thinking has been on the need to move this
objective to an international plane. The UK departure from the exchange rate
mechanism a year ago today and the subsequent crumbling of the system itself
have made such a perspective more rather than less necessary. Indeed, the
establishment on January 1 next year of the European Monetary Institute
provides a heaven-sent opportunity to make progress. (The betting at the
moment is that Mr Wim Duisenburg, the Dutch chairman of the EC central
bankers, will act as interim chairman until an outside president can be
found.)
Irrespective of whether or not the institute leads to a European central
bank, as originally planned, it needs to formulate a monetary policy for the
whole Community, designed to produce enough cash spending for the whole area
but without financing resumed inflation. It was the lack of such a concerted
policy which undermined both the ERM and wider attempts at G7 currency
policy. But irrespective of exchange rates, a joint international
stabilisation effort is itself a valid objective.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Talks on the rocks: Chris Patten's confrontation with China
could leave him isolated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten has returned from his summer holiday to face the most
testing time of his short governorship of Hong Kong. Talks that started in
April between Britain and China about the colony's political development are
going badly.
After nearly 100 hours of negotiations about arrangements for local
elections in 1994 and 1995 - the last before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997 - the two sides appear no closer to resolving their
differences.
The whispers of British diplomats and Hong Kong government officials suggest
that, unless there is some movement, the talks could collapse within months
of their resumption next week.
The result of failure would be to create uncertainty that would damage
investors' confidence and exacerbate public fears about the transition to
Chinese rule. A collapse of the talks would mean the UK 'going it alone' on
Hong Kong's political development and trying to enact measures in the face
of vigorous opposition from China. China would probably block strategic
infrastructure projects - such as the colony's planned HKDollars 165bn Chek
Lap Kok airport.
Deadlock has arisen in spite of compromises offered by the British team on
two of Mr Patten's most controversial reform proposals.
First, for the selection in 1995 of nine new elected members of the
60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's lawmaking body, Mr Patten
initially wanted to give votes to nine groups of employees in different
sectors of the economy, amounting to 2.7m people. But in negotiations,
Britain offered to cut the number to just 1.3m. Beijing, however, envisages
giving votes to only a few thousand.
Second, Mr Patten has moved on the composition of an 'electoral college' to
select a further 10 LegCo members. At first, he wanted it to consist of
about 360 of the local government officials elected next year, but he has
now agreed with Beijing that the college should comprise four broad-based
groups, of which politicians would be just one. The sticking point is that
Britain wants college members to be elected; Beijing wants agreed government
appointees.
Britain and China have always had conflicting objectives. Mr Patten wants
the UK to leave behind an open society where values such as fair elections,
the rule of law, and free speech have a chance to flourish. Beijing wants to
ensure the 1995 elections will not create a political structure it cannot
control.
Early optimism in the colony about the talks resulted from a feeling that
Beijing wanted a direct influence on events in Hong Kong before the British
left. But since last month optimism has evaporated - mainly, it appears,
because Hong Kong has become hostage to Beijing's internal politics.
British diplomats suggest that the increasing frailty of Deng Xiaoping, 89,
China's pre-eminent leader who has guided Hong Kong policy for more than a
decade, has increased political uncertainty and so produced an impasse.
Adding to Mr Patten's worries are signs that the pull of China on the colony
is getting stronger. Anecdotal evidence that the Hong Kong Chinese are
identifying themselves increasingly with the civilisation, if not the
government, of China has come from several directions:
Growing numbers of middle-class Chinese, though probably still a minority,
who hold foreign passports now say they would be prepared to swap them, if
necessary, for Chinese nationality.
When Mr Martin Lee, a former president of the Hong Kong Bar, tried earlier
this summer to bring a libel action against a Beijing adviser, he was
rebuffed by 11 of the colony's leading firms of solicitors, who feared
offending China. The honour of the legal profession had to be salvaged by
the president of the Law Society, who agreed to represent him.
Mr Simon Murray last month stepped down from the management of Hutchison
Whampoa, a diversified conglomerate, partly because the company's
controlling shareholder, tycoon Mr Li Ka-shing, had banned him from speaking
publicly in support of Mr Patten. Mr Murray's support for the governor was
not good for business, Mr Li had calculated.
Mr Rupert Murdoch's sale of the South China Morning Post - Hong Kong's
oldest English-language newspaper - to Chinese investors has cost Mr Patten
a friend in the colony and may reverse the Post's support for the governor.
Opinion polls still show high approval ratings for Mr Patten in the colony -
nearly 60 per cent - but expectations of the UK and China reaching agreement
are at a record low. The latest poll showed just 37 per cent believing the
two countries could do a deal, compared with 63 per cent in April.
If the talks do collapse, the price for both sides will be high. For
Beijing, a smooth transfer from British to Chinese rule is at risk. Its
international reputation would be tarnished if, after 1997, it rebuffed a
democratically elected LegCo.
For Mr Patten, to try to go ahead with his proposals without Chinese consent
could backfire. British power is on the wane in Hong Kong and he may find
that, when forced to choose between China and an engaging British
politician, the people of Hong Kong will choose China.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S LATEST bout of fiscal activism, a Y5,000bn (Pounds 30.7bn) package
of public spending and tax credits, is expected to be announced in Tokyo
today. It could not have been better timed. The combination of the recent
batch of bleak indicators and Tuesday's news that gross domestic product
contracted by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, means that the economy may
finally be about to slip into an American-style recession in which output
falls in consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, US Treasury under-secretary Larry
Summers, in Tokyo today to press the US case for import targets, will
presumably have little option but to congratulate the Ministry of Finance
for this prompt display of neo-Keynesian pump-priming.
The doom and gloom pronouncements of Japanese financial and corporate
commentators have often seemed overdone over the past two years. The
aftermath of the collapse of the late 1980s financial house of cards has
certainly created disturbances throughout the economy. But Japan, unlike
Germany, has so far escaped an Anglo-Saxon-style recession. Equally, the
Ministry of Finance and the Economic Planning Agency have seemed dangerously
complacent about the prospects for an imminent upturn. Earlier fiscal
packages, grudgingly agreed, have been tardily implemented. And the Bank of
Japan has eased monetary policy too slowly, despite evidence that much of
the banking system remains burdened by bad debts.
Now the evidence is moving in the pessimists' favour. Higher government
spending in the second quarter did not outweigh the decline in private
activity, particularly consumption and exports. Department store sales are
still falling, credit creation is stagnant and the yen's recent appreciation
is biting deep into profit margins. No wonder the Tankan survey of business
confidence shows that manufacturers are now gloomier than they have been for
18 years.
Domestically, the economy is clearly crying out for stimulus. The
government's sound fiscal position means that there is little danger in
responding, especially as the Ministry of Finance appears to have held out
for more spending rather than an income tax cut. But fiscal activism will
not, by itself, remove the main obstacle to recovery: the dreadful state of
Japanese bank balance sheets. Only a large cut in short-term interest rates,
or some other form of concessional refinancing of the banking system, can
speed what looks set to be a slow and weak recovery.
The fiscal package also serves a second, international function. With the
trade surplus still rising, and the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund in Washington only a week away, the Ministry of Finance is
under great pressure to drop its justified opposition to explicit targets
for the current account surplus and import penetration. But if Japan wants
to persuade the world that it is serious about reviving domestic demand for
imports, it will need to persuade US and EC politicians to lift their eyes
from the details of the short-term fiscal package.
For it is the new government's deregulatory agenda that holds out most hope
for a radical change in Japan's economic relations. The share of consumption
in Japanese GDP is low, in part, because the Japanese like to save, but also
because the vast panoply of controls, rules and taxes  - especially in the
distribution and housing sectors - makes consumption so difficult.
Japan's weak and divided coalition has yet to prove that it will be able to
implement the kind of radical, liberalising agenda that Japan needs. But if
it can, the effects on imports and the trade surplus would outweigh those of
any plausible fiscal package.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTURE of Britain and Italy from the European exchange rate mechanism
a year ago today arguably constituted the biggest monetary rupture since the
collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s.
The comparison is suggestive, in that both events coincided with big changes
in the global political and economic balance. In the first case, it was the
waning of US power and influence as a result of the Vietnam war; the
currency dislocation was widely attributed to the inflationary financing of
the US military effort. In the second, the de facto collapse of the ERM
coincided with the end of the cold war and the explosive growth of parts of
the Asian economy, while the technical economic cause lay in the refusal of
the French to permit a D-Mark appreciation within the ERM in response to
German unification.
It is not difficult to make the case that these monetary phenomena were
symptomatic of deeper problems and that the markets were, in both cases,
providing an adjustment mechanism to cope with the fall-out from government
policies that ran far ahead of public opinion. The inflationary nature of
the Vietnam war financing was, after all, necessitated by a lack of popular
support; and there has clearly been a failure on the part of Europe's
political elite to understand the fears of ordinary people who have to bear
the brunt of the adjustment to difficult new economic realities.
The farmers who are agitating in the streets of Paris against the US-EC farm
trade deal are just one example of how the fear of globalisation and of
competition from lower-paid workers in the developing world is eating into
the psyche of the underskilled. They sense a threat to real incomes; and
rightly so, since the scale of structural adjustment in older industries
will be painful as millions in China and elsewhere industrialise.
In a world where there is no shortage of global demand, but where the
balance of that demand is being redistributed eastward, the important lesson
for the EC is not to fall now into the opposite trap of a populist retreat
into protectionism. That would prevent the reallocation of resources needed
to take advantage of the changes in global economic structure.
On this score the good news, one year after the ERM started to crumble, is
that capital controls have been debated but not introduced. The bad is that
the response of France and Belgium to the more recent upheaval in the ERM
suggests continued resistance to the markets' message.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OF THE EC countries discomfited by last month's ERM crisis, Belgium faces
perhaps the most difficult dilemma. A strong supporter of the EC's economic
and monetary union plan, Belgium is trying to maintain its previous
credentials as a member of the ERM's D-Mark 'hard core'. The price of
Belgium's franc fort is not only high, but looks increasingly unsustainable.
Belgium would like to cling to hard currency status to keep alive the chance
of qualifying for Emu. Additionally, in view of its large dependence on
foreign trade, Belgium wants to avoid devaluation to resist imported
inflation and preserve macroeconomic stability. Unless present policies are
revised, however, neither policy looks likely to be achieved.
The Belgian National Bank, which earlier this month increased interest rates
to keep the franc close to pre-crisis levels, yesterday cut lending rates by
a quarter point to 10 per cent. Yet three-month money market interest rates,
at 9.3 per cent, are still nearly a percentage point above their end-July
level. Bond market yields, at just over 7 per cent, are 4 percentage points
above the inflation rate. For a country saddled by negative economic growth,
14 per cent unemployment, interest payments on government debt of 11 per
cent of gross domestic product, and total outstanding public debt around 130
per cent of GDP, high real interest rates are a self-perpetuating
depressant.
Belgium needs a real rate of economic growth above the real rate of interest
paid on its borrowings. Unless this is achieved, the debt level - the EC's
highest - will continue to grow. If this happens, the Emu aim will remain a
chimera. German promises of 'flexibility' in examining the Emu criteria will
not stretch to allowing Emu participation by a country with debt well over
twice the 60 per cent Maastricht target.
The government is preparing a 'social pact' with trade unions and employers
to restructure labour markets and curb social security payments. However,
because of the debt burden, even large cuts in public spending guarantee no
escape from the deficit treadmill. More aggressive cuts in Belgian interest
rates are required, necessitating willingness either to let the franc float
down through its wider ERM fluctuation bands, or to carry out a formal
devaluation. The Belgian authorities appear to believe that using their
newfound ERM flexibility would bring a damaging loss of economic
credibility. In fact, such a policy switch may represent the only means of
restoring it.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Look east - but don't touch: Victor Mallet says Vietnam is
still out of bounds for US companies as their competitors clean up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a country concerned about perennial trade deficits with Asian countries,
the US has been assiduous in depriving itself of commercial access to one of
the region's fastest-growing economies.
President Bill Clinton's decision on Monday to maintain the US economic
embargo against Vietnam has again frustrated the hopes of American companies
as they try to exploit Vietnamese business opportunities not yet grasped by
Asian and European rivals. The timing of the announcement - 6pm on the day
that Israel and the PLO signed their historic peace agreement in Washington
 -showed clearly how reluctant Mr Clinton remains to seize the Vietnamese
nettle.
The continuation of an embargo dating from the end of the Vietnam war in
1975 is particularly galling for the dozens of US executives poised to start
work in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), because Vietnam had
kept aside some projects - in the oil industry, for example - in the
expectation that sanctions would be lifted.
'I can look at her but I can't kiss her,' said Mr Kent Accord, a Mobil
vice-president, on a visit to Hanoi. He was referring to the Blue Dragon, an
offshore Vietnamese oil concession that Mobil is bidding to assess and
exploit.
Vietnam's eagerness to welcome Americans stems partly from the communist
government's desire to counter the expanding regional political power of
China and the commercial influence of Japan. It is also a side-effect of the
Vietnam war, during which the South Vietnamese who lived and sometimes
fought alongside US soldiers became accustomed to American cigarettes, soap
and trucks.
Everything from Coca-Cola and tinned ravioli to Hollywood videos and pirated
computer software is imported or smuggled into Vietnam from its neighbours.
Many of the trucks from the war era are still running.
American goods still have cachet in a country described by US businessmen in
Hanoi as 'by far the most attractive new market in the world' or,
alternatively, 'one of the most dynamic and promising markets in Asia'. Last
year Vietnam's economy grew by more than 8 per cent in real terms, and is
forecast to grow by as much again this year as the country tries to emulate
the export-led achievements and industrialisation of its Asian neighbours.
Since 1986, the government has undertaken a programme of reform known as doi
moi (renovation), aimed at changing a communist command system into a
market-driven economy. The government says it needs foreign investment of
Dollars 20bn to modernise its economy by the end of the century, of which it
expects about Dollars 12bn from foreign direct investment and a further
Dollars 8bn from foreign government and institutional aid.
Foreign companies have already been granted licences for more than Dollars
6bn-worth of projects. Singaporean enterprises are building hotels and
changing the skylines of the capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's
commercial centre. The Taiwanese are constructing industrial estates where
exporters can locate factories. Japan is investing in food processing and
manufacturing. The French and the Australians are building
telecommunications networks.
The Americans, however, are languishing on the sidelines. A few companies,
including Coca-Cola, signed contracts in the hope that Mr Clinton would lift
the embargo, but at the moment they are prohibited from fulfilling them.
Some US executives ascribe the continuing ban to the political clout wielded
in Washington by pressure groups representing the families of US servicemen
missing in action during the Vietnam war. The lobbyists believe Vietnam is
hiding information about 100 or so unresolved cases, although the Pentagon
says progress is being made on this issue.
American executives find little comfort in Mr Clinton's decision to allow US
companies to compete for contracts funded by international agencies such as
the World Bank.
'Most US business would still be effectively closed out of the Vietnam
market,' said a position paper prepared by US companies and handed to
visiting congressmen recently. 'In most cases, the areas where US business
has a comparative advantage are high technology and are generally not
infrastructure projects of the sort funded by international institutions.'
Oil exploration and banking are two sectors where US companies feel
vulnerable to delay, because only a limited number of openings is on offer
to foreigners in each industry.
Mobil and Amoco have already watched one important oilfield contract go to
BHP Petroleum of Australia, which is leading a consortium to exploit the Big
Bear field off the south coast. A decision on the Blue Dragon concession
nearby is expected to be made by early next year. 'They are getting closed
out of lease after lease,' said one US businessman.
In computers, IBM is itching to service foreign companies in Vietnam - many
of them already IBM customers elsewhere - and to develop the local market.
Mr William Howell, IBM's chief representative in Vietnam, said international
banks were waiting for IBM to be allowed to install its equipment in their
Vietnam branches, but 'it's only a matter of time before they are forced to
buy from other suppliers', he said.
In telecommunications, France's Alcatel and others are establishing mobile
telephone and paging systems while Motorola executives twiddle their thumbs.
'Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi need these systems,' said Mr Greig Craft of
American Service Co, a consultancy which represents US companies. 'They
can't wait.'
The same is true for owners of the ageing, black Russian Volga cars used in
Vietnam, who are now replacing them with Toyotas and Hondas. Chrysler has
been fighting a rearguard action to try to ensure access for US carmakers,
especially for four-wheel-drive vehicles. To its dismay, the job of
preparing a master plan for the development of the entire Vietnamese auto
industry has gone to Mitsubishi of Japan.
The tragedy for the US, according to Vietnamese businessmen and officials
and the growing US business community, is that the Americans are shutting
themselves out of the last significant market in south-east Asia.
'The Vietnamese have demonstrated this willingness to leave the door open to
US participation in key sectors,' said Mr Craft, 'and were encouraged when
they saw that contracts could be signed (following an earlier easing of the
embargo). They have done this at the expense of equally qualified Asian,
Australian and other companies. And now they can't wait any longer.'
Since the US lifted its objections to multilateral funding for Vietnam in
July - which the country needs to repair ports and roads to support its
economic recovery - the US business community rather than the Vietnamese
government has made the loudest pleas for ending the embargo.
Some western diplomats and businessmen believe sanctions may be eased
further by the end of the year, when Mr Clinton may have cleared his desk of
more pressing legislative issues such as healthcare reform and the North
American Free Trade Agreement. By then, they fear US corporations may have
lost the advantages they once had.
For almost two decades the Vietnamese have accused the Americans of using
the embargo to punish them economically for having won the war; these days,
as Vietnam's economy grows without them, many Americans are asking why they
are punishing themselves for having lost it.

   THE TRADE UNION QUESTION IN BRITISH POLITICS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Government and Unions since 1945
By Robert Taylor
Blackwell (for the Institute of Contemporary British History),
Pounds 13.99 paperback, Pounds 37.50 hardback, 406 pages (paperback)
The widespread assumption across a large area of UK political thinking is
that trade unionism, as we knew it, is dead. Like socialism, the argument
goes, it belongs to the age of collectivist philosophy that has run its
course and has given way to an overwhelming individualism, propelled by, if
not dependent on, new technology.
The industrial powers of the world are increasingly seen as warehouses of
information technology, rather than centres of great manufacturing units
employing tens of thousands of workers in one group of factories. Phrases
like 'post-Fordism' and even 'post-capitalist' are used to describe the
contemporary scene and to justify the argument that trade unions can be
placed alongside the dinosaur in museums: relics of a bygone age.
It is a seductive line of thought, to be sure; but I do not subscribe to it.
An alternative theory can be quite effectively presented: the technological
revolution may have destroyed the old, simple, collectivist industrial base
on which powerful trade unions like the miners established their influence.
But, in doing so, modern industry has also created a new need - which is for
a more effective democratic voice to espouse the case for social justice in
this new era of technological production. Without such a voice, and a
well-based platform, there could be a significant growth in social,
political and economic tensions that would tear at the whole social fabric.
The dangers are already evident. So it is in this area that modern trade
unionism should have an important, even a crucial, role to play.
In short, new technology, with its revolutionary impact on work, may have
fragmented (and made redundant) large tracts of the old industrial working
class; but it has also created serious problems that a modernised trade
union movement ought to be ideally equipped to tackle. It is in this sphere
that an intelligent government would begin to explore a new dialogue with
the trade unions.
One thing is clear, and comes powerfully from the pages of Robert Taylor's
excellent book: the trade unions have been unjustly blamed for their alleged
role in contributing to national decline. Taylor, who is labour
correspondent at the Financial Times, examines the nature of these charges -
and he rejects the argument, convincingly. It is the best account of the
government-trade union relationship for a long time.
Taylor argues that the failures of UK capitalism, compared, say, with
Germany or Scandinavia and certainly with the US, stem from a complex range
of inherited causes, underscored by the culture of 19th-century industrial
and social attitudes in Britain and its laisser-faire presumptions.
The trade union responses to these mores were always defensive - hardly at
all revolutionary or even markedly political. They were a reflection of an
inadequacy of vision among politicians and industrialists - a reflection,
not a cause. As Taylor observes: 'Whatever politicians and employers might
have desired, Britain's trade unions continued to remain in the postwar
world what they had always been - insecure, voluntary bodies at the mercy of
the often fickle and divided moods of their own members and the uncertain
and often harsh fluctuations of the labour market.'
And he adds that too many political leaders, and others, used the trade
unions with their imperfections as an excuse to divert attention away from
more fundamental reasons for economic decline.
Taylor explains the distrust the Trades Union Congress as an institution had
for the state; how the TUC leaders resisted even the Attlee government in
its attempts to bring the trade union machine more intimately within the
corpus of state power and authority.
Of course, the trade union leadership made many mistakes in in 1945-51
before the Conservatives returned to office. There was an ambivalence about
the role of the unions in the newly nationalised industries: and there was
confusion about the role of unions trying to maintain 'free collective
bargaining' in an increasingly planned economy run by a friendly government.
There were constant crises between the TUC and a succession of Labour
governments over incomes policy - and ultimately the ending of the 'friendly
relationship' with the collapse of the Callaghan government in 1979.
As Taylor asserts, all these crises were part of 'the never-ending dialectic
between freedom and control, between workplace autonomy and state
intervention'.
The Churchill, Eden and Macmillan Conservative governments of the 1950s and
early 1960s all accepted the essential role unions had to play in collective
bargaining and sensible industrial relations. Indeed Harold Macmillan often
made a virtue of his affection for trade unionism.
Curiously, the rot probably set in during the Wilson years - especially
after the devaluation of 1967. Yet in 1964 the scene had been set for a
Grand Consensus with George Brown's Declaration of Intent - a kind of
'charter of principles' agreed between government, Confederation of British
Industry and TUC. In fact too much responsibility was put on the shoulders
of union leaders to deliver a pay policy which they never had the power to
hand to any government.
Eventually, through the Heath years, it all led to Margaret Thatcher's
crusade against trade unionism. Yet today, as Taylor cogently argues,
Thatcherism is no longer enough for a society in the throes of vast changes.
The unions remain an essential ingredient within any democratic society.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Steel subsidised at a high cost to UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr D TORDOFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is not only in British Steel's direct interests that an EC industry
restructuring plan is speedily achieved and state subsidies eliminated (Lex:
'Steely determination', September 13). It is also in the interests of
British Steel's customers.
As a UK steel user representative on the EC Consultative Committee, we
believe it is clear that market distortions take place throughout Europe and
beyond which make a mockery of a 'level playing field'.
In my own industry, steel construction, we have lost well over 150 UK
companies and 50,000 jobs in this recession and have to fight for every new
construction project. Yet how do we compete with foreign steelwork
fabricators who are able to buy subsidised steel from their state-owned
steel companies (eg in Italy and Spain) in order to undercut UK companies
for UK bridge contracts?
We are now losing out to steelwork of uncertain quality from eastern Europe
in a UK government building project] The new Inland Revenue Amenity Building
in Nottingham is to use non-certified Polish steelwork for its complex roof
structure - is this called 'biting the hand of the economy that feeds you'?
Buying from such sources might save a few percentage points in first cost -
but at what total cost to the UK economy and the consequences for direct and
indirect employment?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALASTAIR GOODLAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I assure the president of the Export Group for the Constructional
Industries (Letters, September 8) that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
is well aware of the commercial potential of the former Soviet Union and
Baltic states. Our exports to the area for the first seven months in 1993
show an increase of 64 per cent over the same period in 1992. We currently
have posts in nine of the 15 countries there, four of them opened in the
last year. The six countries where we have no resident missions are all
covered by other posts. We would hope to open other missions as funds become
available. The first priority of these posts is to help British exporters,
in particular by establishing close relations with the local government.
We recognise the excellent contribution which the construction industry has
made to British exports and know of its interest, not just in the former
Soviet Union but in other important markets such as the Asian Pacific Rim
and the Middle East.
We are acutely aware of the requirements of British exporters for diplomatic
posts and staff, and will be examining, in the light of the outcome of the
current public expenditure round, how we can best respond to them.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Too one-sided a presentation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY TOPF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While the need to provide a brief summary of complicated events can
lead to a less than exhaustive history, the 'chronology of the (Middle East)
conflict' in your August 31 edition is nothing less than a distortion of
history ('Peace plan poised on a hair trigger'). Summarising the 1948 Arab
rejection of the UN partition plan, and Israel's war of independence against
the invading armies of surrounding Arab states as 'first Arab-Israeli war,
Israel annexes large portions of proposed Arab state in Palestine' is bad
enough. Ignoring acts of war initiated by Arab states in 1967, the threat to
Israel's existence in June 1967, and the defensive nature of the Six-Day war
by presenting it as 'Israel attacks Egypt, Syria and Jordan' is either a
slavish presentation of false propaganda, or an insult to your readers'
knowledge and intelligence, or both.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E R STEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One way for British Gas to protect its monopoly is to seek regulation
of the regulator ('British Gas demands curbs on regulator', September 7).
British Gas spends a great deal of time, money and resources on public
relations and political lobbying. I am sure that it would like a more
comfortable relationship with its regulator so it could take full advantage
of the situation.
Even if its market share is reduced to 25 per cent in due course, British
Gas will continue to wield immense power over the UK's gas industry. As
mentioned by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Ofgas under Sir James
McKinnon has had a positive impact, bringing down British Gas charges for
gas transportation and price in the tariff market. I find it hard to imagine
that without Sir James's no-nonsense approach British Gas would have brought
down prices of its own accord.
I hope his successor proves to be equally tenacious and committed. Although
the MMC has opened the door to competition a bit further, it still leaves a
lot to be done. There is a danger that the flames of competition just
unleashed in the gas market will be extinguished. We will need a 'Sir James'
more than ever.

against regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY EVERITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your architecture correspondent caricatures the work of our architecture
unit and misleads your readers with a prejudiced account of its grants
('Council misses the point', September 13).
There is no London bias and no bloated bureaucracy. Thirty-four out of 36
recent awards will benefit the public in the English regions; as to
'offices, personnel and the inbreeding of arts bureaucrats', your critic may
be reassured, since the architecture unit consists of just two persons. (Our
distinguished advisory group gives its services free of charge.)
Your correspondent takes us to task for our apparent disdain of history, but
a glance at our grants shows this to be untrue. A modest grant of Pounds
1,000 to the Georgian Group, for example, will help it create a touring
exhibition looking at the design of today's cities and their Georgian
predecessors.
With our valuable sponsors, English Estates, we see the benefits of
encouraging the public to take an educated interest in the art of
architecture in the context of large-scale building developments. That is
why we have jointly supported proposals to create an architecture centre in
the east Thames corridor and in eight other regions of England.
All of these things your correspondent might have discovered for himself had
he bothered to inquire.

TINA: WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT? (18)
Brian Gibson
THE BABY OF MACON (18)
Peter Greenaway
DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST (18)
Julie Dash
ACCION MUTANTE (18)
Alex de la Iglesia
Biopics of living characters are fraught with two potential problems. Either
the makers tend to gloss over the story in order to avoid the ire of subject
and fans, or else the scandal knobs are turned to full volume so that every
lurid whisper can be heard. It is to the credit of Tina: What's Love Got to
do With It that it steers a course somewhere between these two extremes,
making for an engaging and believable star treatment.
Most people have at least some acquaintance with Tina Turner - the ageless
legs, the majestic mane of hair, the stadium size voice. What few realised
before the recent publication of her autobiography was that for the first 20
years of her career she was on the receiving end of terrible abuse from her
husband Ike. It was a storybook romance at first, with Tina (whose real name
is Anna Mae Bullock) meeting Ike when she took the stage at an amateur hour
at his St Louis club. Despite a string of powerful R&amp;B records and steady
success on the concert circuit, however, Ike and Tina never really hit the
big time, always a half step behind whatever trend held sway. The resulting
strain took its toll on Ike, who lashed out at Tina with drug-fuelled fits
of rage until the late 1970s, when she finally was able to leave him.
Director Brian Gibson tells this often brutal story with admirable honesty,
refusing either to pull punches or linger on them. He moves seamlessly
through Kate Lanier's strong script, avoiding the melodrama that beckons
throughout. The picture has a decidedly authentic look as well as feel -
Ike's transformations of dress and coiffure chart the passing years with wry
accuracy. Only at the film's end, in which Turner's Buddhism is touted and
the star herself appears in a final concert sequence, does the film go
beyond drama into the realm of homage.
The two leads turn in powerful performances. Laurence Fishburne is
frighteningly charismatic as the brooding Ike - it is easy to see why Anna
Mae falls for him as a young man, easier still to see why Tina leaves him
two decades later. In a decidedly thankless role, Fishburne manages to win
our understanding for Ike's monstrous behaviour without ever asking us to
sympathise with it. And Angela Basset is equally fine as Tina, making the
singer's long sufferance credible. And a special note for courage should go
to James Reyne, who, in the role of Turner's manager Roger Davies, has the
unnerving task of portraying the film's executive producer.
Abuse of a different sort is the subject of Peter Greenaway's latest
celluloid conundrum, The Baby of Macon. Set during the 17th century, the
film depicts a play in performance at a provincial French theatre, attended
by a young prince and his entourage. The play's action concerns a beautiful
child who, after being miraculously born to a grotesque old woman, is
believed to be imbued with holy powers. The child's greedy sister claims him
as her own, charging supplicants for the baby's grace. She is soon
discredited, only to kill the child after he is taken away from her. The
city's religious authorities sentence her to death, overcoming a loophole
that forbids the execution of virgins by having her raped by 200 men before
she is to be hanged.
Greenaway tells this story with his usual self-satisfied and gross
pomposity, mixing ornately stylised visuals with truly unpleasant moments. A
placenta is tasted, boils and sores are displayed, a young man is
graphically gored by a bull, the murdered child is sliced into small pieces
for souvenir hunters. In perhaps the film's most unsettling moment, the
child, at the age of perhaps four, watches as his sister/mother (Julia
Ormond, a shoe-in for trouper of the year) foreplays in the nude with a
young man.
Despite the unfiltered gore and cinematic dare, however, the film is
stultifyingly boring, as murky and static as a painting badly in need of
restoration. Much is written about Greenaway but little is said about just
how bad he is at composing dialogue. One wonders what kind of movie he could
make if he teamed with someone who understood dramatic writing. On the other
hand, as long as he is in charge of both script and direction, it certainly
takes away any element of doubt as to whether or not to see the film. Give
it a miss. Despite the controversy and attention he somehow manages to
engender, Greenaway continues to be the master of making moviegoing the one
thing it should never be - drudgery.
Another filmmaker who is not overly concerned with narrative punch is Julie
Dash, maker of Daughters of the Dust. Set on an island off the coast of
South Carolina at the turn of the century, Dash's film concerns a day in the
life of the black Peazant family as most of its members are about to
emigrate north. Little actually happens in the course of the day, and when
it does, it is hard to understand exactly what it is.
Dash films her exotic setting with an exquisite eye, creating some memorable
tableaux as she captures the primal mystery of this all-black enclave.
Unfortunately, like many visually gifted directors, she has a tin ear,
producing a script that at times sounds like an anthropology text, at others
is laden with cliches of the 'you have to change with the times' variety.
And her refusal to spend much time establishing characters or explaining
their conflicts makes this more like a stroll through a exhibition of sepia
photographs than a full blooded drama.
Which brings us to the comprehensively unhinged antics of Accion Mutante. To
describe the plot of this bit of insanity is akin to writing a study guide
to a Marvel Comic, but here goes. It is the year 2012 and the world is run
by beautiful people, with fascist cops administering beatings to any
cripples who try to step out of line. Not surprisingly, the disabled feel
hard done by, so some of them form a terrorist organisation to strike back.
When their leader is released from prison they decide to kidnap an
industrialist's daughter from her wedding, spiriting her off to a planet
inhabited by crazed miners.
The Spanish director Alex de la Iglesia's film is every bit as bizarre as
you might expect. But, despite the promising premise and frantic energy, the
film is nowhere near as much fun as it needs to be to grab the viewer.
Although there is plenty of gore and knockabout action, as well as a
pleasingly idiosyncratic view of the future, the film lacks any sustained
wit, at least the sort that can survive translation into subtitles. The
result is an inescapable feeling that all this sound and fury signifies next
to nothing.

The BBC used to be very supercilious about running comedies in tandem; it
was considered rampant commercialism and unimaginative. Now here is BBC1
running three comedies with only the Nine O'Clock News to break them up.
Waiting For God is Michael Aitkens' excellent series, set in a retirement
home where the inmates include Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden, a
tremendously strong pairing. Will that continue now that they are sharing
quarters?
One Foot In The Grave (9.30) concentrates upon the same age group, though
Victor and Margaret Meldrew live in their own home. Today's repeated episode
is the one where Victor turns to the phone book for help over the hole at
the bottom of his garden. Absolutely Fabulous is another repeat,
transferring from BBC2. Jennifer Saunders plays a manic PR woman in the
fashion industry and Joanna Lumley effortlessly steals every scene. (10.00).
BBC2 shows what it is like to be a comedian in A Stand-Up For Life. American
Al Lubel gave up his job as a lawyer in order to become a comic (9.30).

FT  16 SEP 93 / Arts: The saga of 'Anna Karenina' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The albatross round the neck of our ballet companies, the horror in the East
Wing, the gun pointed at classical dance's temples, is the three-act ballet.
Down at the box office they know the ghastly truth: an evening of three
one-act ballets will keep the audience away in droves. A full-length piece -
and never mind its merits, just concentrate on the title - will fill the
house. This preposterous situation is national (and increasingly
international), and it is owed, I suspect, to the Royal Ballet's success in
making the old 'classics' popular with audiences, and in then producing
choreographers - Ashton, Cranko, MacMillan, Bintley - able to make valuable
extensions of the genre. With emulative snobbery, other troupes have, since
the 1950s, led audiences to believe that three acts of choreography is
better than three separate works, that big is beautiful, and that packaging
is more important than content.
Our ballet companies are now Frankensteins, hostage to their evening-long
monster. Large or small in forces and funding, they produce what their
public paymasters want. Literature, opera, can be gutted for theme,
irrespective of the original, provided that the title is well-enough known.
In the darkest days of Stalinism, Soviet ballet found a creative refuge in
such policies: today's imperatives are those of financial rather than
artistic survival. And ballet is dying on its carefull -pointed feet because
of this. Where the three-acters of Ashton, Cranko, MacMillan, extended and
developed the idea of the large-scale piece, today's offering are in the
main facile, safe, unthink-ing.
Scottish Ballet under the choreographic direction of its founder, Peter
Darrell, produced work that sought to show the possibilities of the form:
his Sun into Darkness and Mary, Queen of Scots (with a brave score by Thea
Musgrave), were adventurous. The company's latest acquisition, Andre
Prokovsky's Anna Karenina is predictable. Prokovsky has produced several
long ballets: his programme biography lists The Three Musketeers, Dr
Zhivago, The Great Gatsby, La Traviata, Macbeth and Victoria (whether
station, queen, or Australian state, I know not). Anna Karenina, which dates
from 1979, is what one might expect, given the score (a Tchaikovsky
hot-pot), the theme (parts of a Tolstoyan skeleton), and the designer (Peter
Farmer at his most vaporous).
The action amounts to 'unhappy married woman takes lover and chucks herself
under train'. The choreography does what it does, and has to provide
ensembles - a skating scene; a ball replete with dancers failing to convince
us they are aristos; peasants romping - to give Anna and Vronsky time to
change from one dull outfit to another. (Vronsky is got up like Prince
Charming: Anna goes to a dressmaker who has been traumatised by seeing
Georgiadis's designs for Manon.) The rest of the cast tread dutifully round
the edges of the action.
It is all well-meant and rather musty. I could see, during Tuesday night's
performance at the Kings Theatre, Edinburgh, that with the artistry of
Galina Samsova (now director of the company), the role of Anna - which
Samsova created - might be fascinating. Noriko Ohara's Anna did not convince
me at any moment, nor did Robert Hampton's Vronsky. Vladislav Bubnov, a
recent recruit from the Bolshoi Ballet, showed in a couple of brief
interludes a freedom and spaciousness of style that were a reproach to every
other body on stage.
Scottish Ballet performs Anna Karenina on tour to Aberdeen, Liverpool, Hull,
Sheffield, Inverness, until the end of October

FT  16 SEP 93 / Arts: Pianists play it out in Leeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been torrential rain for the 30th anniversary of the great
triennial Leeds contest: or to give it its full title, The Harveys Leeds
International Pianoforte Competition. (Since the halfway mark, 1978, Harveys
of Bristol have been the principal sponsors.) Founded by Fanny Waterman -
who remains its Chairman - and Marion Thorpe, it has become one of the five
or six leading piano competitions in the world. Despite, it must be said,
having to hold its later rounds in one of the least suitable venues in the
country: for the live audience, the lofty vault of the Town Hall can turn
piano-sound into queasy mush.
Many of the 76 young contenders this year are prizewinners from other
contests. Their number has already been whittled down, to 25 after a first
round of 40-minute recitals ('The Jury reserves the right to stop a
performance at any time'); and then, after a second round of 55-minute ones,
to 12 semi-finalists. Most of the 15-strong jury are distinguished pianists
and/or teachers; inevitably some of the contestants, from 23 countries, are
or have been pupils of one or another of them, which must require a lot of
tact in the jury-room.
Among the semi-finalists heard so far in their 75-minute recitals have been
two Italians, of whom the bearded 24-year-old Filippo Gamba stood out. He
was strong and thoughtful, if not very warm, in Schumann's Humoreske, and
unfolded rich textures in two Debussy preludes. In Prokofiev's grandly
morose Sonata no. 8, however, he displayed mature power and insight of the
first order.
It was the hard luck of Luca Ballerini (28), a cool and careful pianist, to
have chosen that sonata for his own recital the previous day: a spidery
pencil-sketch, against Gamba's full oil-canvas. (They are both students of
Maria Tipo, who might have had a word with Ballerini some time ago: 'Luca,
you do realise that Filippo has chosen the Prokofiev for his programme too .
. . ?')
Another 28-year-old Tipo pupil, the Brazilian Ricardo Castro, was admirably
sound and cultivated in Schumann's Etudes symphoniques, in Debussy and in
Liszt's 'Dante' Sonata, his piece de resistance. Musically and technically
he was fully equal to that glorious showpiece, but I missed anything much
like magic in the actual sound: a 'Dante' that doesn't occasionally make
one's hair stand is only half a 'Dante'.
In his quirky way, Richard Ormrod (19) came closer to that kind of
inspiration in the 'other' Liszt sonata, the great B minor. There were some
odd tempi, and much heavy underlining where none was needed; his best
passages, however, struck persuasively to the heart of the music. So he did
too, sometimes, in the great Schubert B-flat, despite proceeding headlong
through it - not fast, but with hardly a pause for breath.
He and Leon McCawley (20) were the youngest semi-finalists, and the only
British ones. McCawley's deliciously sprightly, beautifully graded Haydn
sonata (H. XVI 50) was a winner, and the Beethoven C minor Variations
matched it. Schumann's gentle Waldszenen struck me as brittly over-pointed,
though interesting, and the strenuous Samuel Barber sonata brave but
lightweight. This is nonetheless a pianist with a gleaming future.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Arts: An anxious 'Romeo and Juliet'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Romeo and Juliet opens the autumn season at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre
with Coward's Blithe Spirit and Pinter's Old Times to come before the year's
end. The Rep under Bill Alexander is allowing drama to bear its part
alongside dance and contemporary music in Birmingham's rejuvenated arts. A
solid Romeo and Juliet directed by Gwenda Hughes consolidates the company's
gains over the last six months: this is dependable without being inspired,
but fresh enough not to be predictable.
The production's greatest asset is Robert Jones's wonderful static set of
sumptuous blue hangings fretted with gold, as if Romeo had died and Juliet
had indeed cut him into little stars. The hangings fall from a Hawksmoor
ceiling frame which moves down to create the claustrophobic interiors in
which most of the action takes place. The floor is blue and gold, and
pillars lead the eye to the mural of Verona at the back of the stage.
But the scope of the set strains the action by spreading it out. The
strength of last year's RSC Romeo was that it created intimate spaces on a
large stage. Here, Hughes likes to keep distance between characters, and
this slows both the verse and the action, with mid-line pauses while actors
cross the spaces between them. The two hour's traffic promised by the
prologue is more like an M40 jam tailing back three and a half hours, even
in this lightly cut version of the 1595 text.
The verse speaking, too, needs to be more natural and less deliberate. There
is a tendency to reach for the excitement and pace that the verse gives
naturally. This straining means that lines are artificially raised at the
end. Statements sound like questions: 'Love goes towards love as schoolboys
from their books?' and 'I am fortune's fool?' Imagine the effect in everyday
life: 'Good evening? I'm you're captain for this flight?'
The principals have yet to centre themselves in the parts. Josette
Bushell-Mingo is a strong, versatile actress whose talents are confined
rather than concentrated by playing Juliet; and Damian Lewis' Romeo lacks
the intense assertiveness of a man possessed by passion. Their love is still
searching for sweetness and quietness, and has about it an anxiety which
typifies the production. Elsewhere, Mark Jax's Mercutio gives away his
'Queen Mab' speech by depending on the reactions of his on-stage listeners
and meandering downstage, dissipating the energies of the verse.
But the production finds a lasting image of Romeo and Juliet curled together
in death, like casual sleepers. Over their bodies, the handshake between
Montague and Capulet had particular poignancy in this week of handshakes.
Until October 9 (021 236 4455)

FT  16 SEP 93 / Technology: A robot that makes the coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Science fiction often features machines which respond obediently to orders
barked out by humans. In the imaginary world, robots fetch slippers, cook
dinner and perform the role of high-technology 'slaves'.
A robot which can perform complex tasks still exists only in the realm of
dreams, but scientists say we may not be far from the day when we can wake
up, shout out 'Temperature 72`F] Coffee-maker on] Toaster on]' and get up 15
minutes later to a warm house, fresh coffee and breakfast.
What might make this dream reality is the development of 'voice-recognition'
technology, which enables machines to understand spoken commands. Bringing
voice-activated devices to the mass market is the mission of Voice Powered
Technology. The group already produces a VCR programmer which operates by
voice command, and will launch another speech-activated device, a
'date-reminder', in the autumn.
Just how many people will prefer to use their voice instead of their fingers
in operating home appliances is not yet certain, but the new VCR programmer
has caught the attention of Philips Consumer Electronics.
The US subsidiary of the Dutch electronics giant has contracted with Voice
Powered Technology to use the voice-activated programming device in two of
its Magnavox VCR models, and as a stand-alone remote control accessory.
'An overwhelming number of consumers still have trouble programming their
VCRs,' says Jim Newbrough, vice-president of marketing at Philips, 'and the
use of voice enables us to differentiate our products.' The VCR programmer
prompts the user by flashing questions on the television screen. In response
to the question 'Which?', for instance, the user would say a number. The
user can also make the programmer skip over commercials in a recording by
saying 'Zap it]'
The 'date-reminder' device, which will come out this autumn, works in the
following manner: the user says a phrase such as 'Don't forget to call John
Doe, Monday at 9.00 am'. The date-reminder recognises the words Monday and
9.00 am, and records the rest of the message. On Monday at nine, the machine
will beep and spit out the recording.
The technology used in these devices is relatively simple.
The video programmer, for instance, has a vocabulary of just 31 words.
Both are operated by an eight-bit microprocessor, instead of the heavy
digital signal processor that most voice-recognition technology relies on.
'This enabled us to offer the product as a battery-operated device,' says
Jerry Gutterman, of Voice Powered Technology. The group hopes the simplicity
of its technology will allow it to be applied to a number of domestic
appliances.
'We are taking voice-recognition to the masses,' says Gutterman, 'and this
technology can be applied to a number of products, including CD players,
coffee machines and microwaves.'
The day a machine can be commanded to cook a meal may not be so far off,
after all.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Technology: Something to shout about - The voice recognition
systems ready to hit the mass market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The concept of 'voice recognition' - the capability of computers to
understand human speech - has been around for some time, but the limited
success of computers in comprehending complex spoken phrases has kept this
technology from the mass market.
This may be about to change, as companies turn away from the goal of
complete computer fluency to more simplistic applications. 'Until now, most
of the focus has been on esoteric systems for nuclear submarines, jet
aircraft and computers which understand complicated, spoken sentences,' says
Jerry Gutterman, chief financial officer for Voice Powered Technology, a
California company which is working on voice activation for home appliances.
'But in its simpler form, voice recognition technology is already reliable
enough to be introduced into the mass market.' It is not surprising that one
of the first mass-market sectors to embrace this technology is
telecommunications.
AT&amp;T, the US long-distance carrier, Nynex, the regional telephone company
for the north-east of the US, Northern Telecom, Canada's telephone giant and
Motorola, the American communications group, are all heavily involved in
voice recognition research, and most already have products on the market.
Several automatic dialling systems using voice recognition have started
operation. Nynex has introduced the system to 160 customers in Long Island,
New York, where the company claims it has met with success. Instead of
pressing buttons by hand, the system allows users to programme up to 50
numbers into their telephone. Each number has a corresponding voice command,
such as 'home', or 'work'.
The telephone memorises the command, and the next time the customer picks up
the receiver and says the word, the telephone will dial the number
automatically. Nynex hopes to offer the service to most of its customers by
the end of 1994 for between Dollars 4 and Dollars 6 a month.
The Lexus car uses a similar system for its Motorola-supplied telephone. The
driver of this luxury car does not even need to pick up the receiver. Saying
the word 'on' is sufficient to receive a dial tone. When the conversation is
over, the word 'off' will disconnect the line.
AT&amp;T also markets a cellular telephone with voice-dialling capabilities.
Voice dialling is a relatively simplistic application because it relies on
'speaker dependent' systems. Under this approach, the computer is trained to
recognise a single voice.
Nynex is considering use of the system to reduce telephone fraud. 'If we had
telephone cards and cellular telephones that respond only to a specific
voice, only one person could use them,' says George Vysotsky, technical
director of advanced speech systems at the company.
The new system would not only provide a new product for customers; it could
also save the group money. Nynex says it loses Dollars 1.8m (Pounds 1.2m) a
month from telephone fraud.
Ultimately, voice-recognition may be used by the telephone sector not so
much to offer a new product to customers, but as a means of saving company
money. Providing operators to service users is expensive for telephone
groups, and their dream is to replace many operator functions with a
voice-recognition device.
Both AT&amp;T and Nynex hope to introduce shortly a system which would recognise
simple commands such as 'collect call' and 'person-to-person'. One challenge
is in teaching computers to screen out irrelevant words. 'People don't
always use these systems in real life as they do in the lab,' says David
Roe, supervisor of speech research at AT&amp;T/Bell Labs.
'The computer may ask: 'Would you like to make a collect call?', and the
customer will respond, 'Huh? Is this the phone company?' The computer has to
be trained to recognise this response as irrelevant, and repeat the
question.'
Another problem, even with the simplest of speaker independent systems, is
coping with a wide range of accents and voice intonations. 'It's difficult
for a computer to recognise strong accents,' says Vysotsky. 'Even elderly
people and teenagers can pose a challenge.'
To overcome the hurdle, Nynex has created 'model' words, formed by mixing
recordings of about 300 people from various ethnic backgrounds, and age
groups. 'By synthesising that many versions of a word, we can come up with a
pretty good model of what the word 'collect' really sounds like, for
instance,' Vysotsky explains. Recognising simple words like 'collect call',
though, is just a first step. The goal of the telephone groups is to use
speaker independent systems for directory inquiries.
Telephone companies in the US and Canada spend vast sums providing directory
information. 'When voice recognition technology first came up, people
thought it would be used for data entry,' says Vysotsky. 'But that's not
very realistic. People get just as tired of talking all day as they get of
typing all day. The best application is for information dissemination.'
Still, the use of voice recognition for directory assistance presents
daunting hurdles. 'Besides the problems of making a computer which will
recognise so many names, it's extremely difficult to build up such a large
database,' says Vysotsky.
Northern Telecom of Canada believes it can crack the problem with a new
voice recognition technique known as 'phoneme recognition'. Instead of
training a computer to recognise specific words and phrases, the company is
training its systems to recognise individual sounds, or 'phonemes'.
The English language, for instance, is made up of 40 phonemes. 'If you use
phonemes, as well as a few basic grammar rules, the programming is easier
and the ability of the computer to understand becomes far greater,' says
Pierre Boisseau, a specialist at Bell-Northern Research, the research and
development subsidiary of Northern Telecom.
The company has used the new system in an experiment to provide stock
quotations to callers over the past year. The computer recognised 2,500
company names by thousands of callers successfully, according to the group.
By the end of 1994, Northern Telecom plans to use the phoneme recognition
system in limited applications for directory assistance. Once its directory
assistance system is in place, the group plans to concentrate on an even
more sophisticated product, a 'personal telephone secretary'.
This system would be capable of screening and forwarding calls. For
instance, the computer could be programmed to accept calls from a single
person or group of people. Most callers would be told that the person they
want to reach is busy, however, it would recognise certain names and put
them through.
This technology is probably years from the marketplace. However, voice
recognition in its simplest form is already being used by the telephone
companies, and is likely to grow in popularity and sophistication. Telephone
groups hope that one day, operators will be obsolete, and every telephone
customer can access complex voice recognition technology at home.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Technology: Forming a brand new gel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bran, the staple of the healthy breakfast cereal, is earning itself a new
image - as a source for a supergel which could be used in wound dressings,
industrial lubricants and food.
GB Gels, of Swansea, has developed a process for making polysaccharide
(complex sugar) gels from vegetable and cereal by-products. American corn
bran, the waste left after the cereal is milled, is proving particularly
useful. The company has already signed a worldwide licensing agreement with
Seton Healthcare for the Oldham-based company to use the gel in wound
dressings. Seton hopes its first product will be a clear hydrogel which will
be used to keep wounds moist and so promote healing, says Graham Collyer,
director for product development and regulatory affairs.
Other uses are numerous. The gel could be used as an inert base to carry
medicines in ointment form. Because it is bio-degradable, unlike today's
synthetic gels, it could be used in agriculture or as a lubricant in oil
drilling.
Most importantly it could be used as a gel in the food industry to replace
gelatin or gels made from seaweed. Rod Greenshields, chief executive officer
of GB Gels, believes US and continental European consumers could be the
first to benefit from the developments because the licensing of new food
substances is more conducive to the gel there than in the UK. As bran is
approved for food use in the US, France and Germany, the gel could easily be
approved as a derivative, says Greenshields. In the UK, the new gel would
have to go through lengthy approvals as a new food additive.
The process developed by GB Gels is similar to brewing beer. The useable
part of the bran is extracted to produce a liquid extract which is treated
with enzymes to make the gel. This can be spray-dried if needed to form a
powder. It can also be passed through a series of purification processes for
truly sterile medical purposes.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (6): Strong catalyst for
change - An ambitious plan is under way to transform the history and
heritage of the Ruhr into an architectural and industrial celebration / The
Emscher Park international building exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR WILLIAM Thomas Mulvany
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
who was born in Dublin in 1806 and died in Dusseldorf in 1885 - would have
been proud of it.
In 1866 he started sinking the first two deep shafts of a coal mine in the
fields near Castrop-Rauxel, an unlikely Irish entrepreneur who joined the
'coal rush' which launched the German Ruhrgebiet, and with it, Germany's
industrial revolution. He called it nostalgically Erin, after his native
land.
It was always a battle to prevent the pit from flooding, and after a decade,
Mr Mulvany sold Erin, and a second colliery, Hibernia, at Gelsenkirchen, to
the new generation of German capitalists emerging in the region.
Today, the pit-head winding gear over Shaft Number Four stands lovingly
restored, painted an appropriate bright green, bearing the name of Erin in
huge capitals, as the symbol of a new industrial estate emerging from the
wasteland left behind by more than a century of coal mining.
By 1895, the pit was producing 430,000 tonnes of coal a year, and employed
1,458 men. In 1973, at the height of the oil crisis, it reached a peak
production of 1.48m tonnes. And on December 31, 1983, it closed - priced out
of the market.
The pit heaps have vanished, and the contaminated earth surrounding the
former coke works has been bulldozed into modest hillocks to decorate a new
landscape. Saplings have already been planted in neat avenues, and they are
starting to dig out an ornamental lake to decorate the site. DM30m has been
set aside by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to bring back a bit of
green to the land of Erin.
The industrial estate at Castrop-Rauxel is just one of more than 80 projects
in an extraordinarily ambitious plan to transform the history and heritage
of the heart of the Ruhr into an architectural and industrial celebration -
and thus lay the basis for new industry, new jobs, and a new environment for
the area.
The Emscher Park international building exhibition was conceived back in
1988 as a way of combining the disparate efforts of 17 towns and cities,
with a population of more than 2m, and covering an area of some 800 square
kilometres, into a concerted effort to revive the entire region.
'They call this the Emscher zone, which sounds very disparaging in German,'
says Mr Dieter Blase, a project leader at the headquarters of the
exhibition, housed in the converted transformer building at the former
Rheinelbe colliery in Gelsenkirchen.
'This is the heart of the region's problems, the result of a century of
chaotic urban development. Our task is to heal the landscape, and at the
same time attract new industry. We are trying to integrate old and new
buildings, and to ensure the highest quality of the projects. We are trying
to bring back a sense of pride, a culture of architecture and construction
to the region.'
The idea of the building exhibition goes all the way back to the 1851 Great
Exhibition in London, when the Crystal Palace was built, and since then has
been repeated in cities like Stuttgart in 1927, Hanover in 1951, and Berlin
in 1957 and 1987. But this is the first time it has been attempted over such
a wide area all at once.
It covers the entire area from Duisburg in the west to Bergkamen in the
east, a corridor of 80 kilometres along the line of the former Emscher river
and the Rhine-Herne canal.
The fundamental idea is to create an Emscher country park, with large
expanses of green space for recreation, linking the unused land between the
cities. In addition, there are four main project areas designed to provide a
focus for the exhibition:
To revive and redevelop the Emscher 'river,' which is today not a river but
an open sewage system; it involves the ecological redesign of 350 kms of
open sewers, and the construction of biological filtration plants, as well
as an attempt to reconstruct a natural river.
Under the slogan of 'working in the park,' to develop a number of high-grade
industrial and commercial sites - like Erin - on former coal, iron and steel
sites.
Under the theme of 'new housing and forms of living,' to renew the best of
existing workers' housing settlements, like garden villages, and create new
housing with a high architectural value.
To preserve the most important industrial monuments to keep the region's
history alive, and find ways of using the old buildings for new purposes.
Virtually all the projects in the exhibition have been organised as
competitions, with the 80 schemes under way chosen from 450 originally
submitted.
The most glamorous - and dramatic - is the plan to transform the inner
harbour at Duisburg, the great steel-making city where the river Ruhr flows
into the Rhine, intended to re-integrate the old city centre with its
industrial heart.
There the competition was won, out of 47 contestants, by an ambitious design
from Sir Norman Foster, the British architect, to build a great
semi-circular block of offices and service-industries around the inner basin
of the harbour, while at the same time renovating the warehouses and mills
which line the waterfront. The problem remains to attract enough outside
private investment to make such an ambitious DM100m project viable, and, so
far, the more modest schemes in the rest of the area are making more rapid
progress.
At the former Waltrop colliery, for example, the whole complex of mine
buildings erected just before the First World War is being converted into
units for small businesses, at a cost of some DM25m. A furniture maker is
already booked to move into the old locomotive engine house. A print shop
will be in the milk bar, and an architect's firm in the old machinery
control room. There will be offices in the wages hall, where the miners drew
their weekly pay, a car repair company, and a steel erector, on green field
sites next door.
All are local companies seeking to expand, rather than new investors
attracted to the region. Mr Blase is conscious that the marketing effort
needs to improve - 'till now there have been only bad sites available,' he
says. 'Now for the first time we're producing good sites. But we need to get
the right people to come in.
'The economic promotion people are working very traditionally, and simply
marketing the sites. By next year we will have an excess of sites, so they
must start looking for investors with innovation potential, who are set to
expand.'
He sees one big advantage over similar attempts to restructure old
industrial areas in Britain: the Ruhr region is the most modern of Europe's
old industrial areas, and the basic infrastructure does not require
modernisation. There is an excellent autobahn system, with ample capacity,
and good rail links.
'Our idea of structural policy is very different to the British idea,' he
says. 'Here, it is primarily a question of networking and co-operation,
bringing people together to produce new ideas.'
He cites as an example, the need to persuade traditional Ruhr construction
companies, for years the leading specialists in railway construction,
shaft-sinking and tunnelling, to switch to the new growth area of water
supply and sewerage replacement schemes - as required by the reconstruction
of the Emscher river system. That is precisely how he sees the building
exhibition as a catalyst for change, and new growth.
And yet, in a curious way, history also repeats itself. At Erin, the main
problem faced by the new industrial estate is how to prevent the water in
its artificial lake leaking into the old mine workings. Mr Mulvany, whose
mine was flooded out three times, and finally abandoned for 10 years before
they mastered the problem, must be wearing a wry Irish grin.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (5): Plan for a high-tech
future - Education and manpower training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT the beginning of this century, the region was called the 'Red Ruhr' -
feared by the authorities as a dangerous hot-bed for socialist ideals. To
keep the Ruhr under control, Kaiser Wilhem II pledged then there would be
'no students and no soldiers' in the region.
In 1993, the Ruhr is still ruled by the political left, personified by Mr
Johannes Rau, the state's popular, grey-haired prime minister. But now, far
from having 'no students,' North Rhine-Westphalia claims to have more
universities and centres of higher education per head than any other area in
the European Community.
Higher education and vocational training are two important trump cards which
local politicians display when asked about the region's attractions.
A walk through the depressed city of Rheinhausen, where the steelmaker Krupp
closed a plant last August, vividly illustrates why manpower training
schemes are politically crucial to employment in the Ruhr.
The hope is to foster more high-technology companies which brought
prosperity to the southern states of Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria. Two key
ingredients are essential: a diversified, export-driven industrial base and
a highly trained workforce. Heavy industry has made great efforts to
diversify. The Mannesmann group is an example - it once mined coal for
factories which manufactured seamless metal tubes. Today, it has diversified
into electronics, hydraulic systems, plant construction and engineering.
To offer industry a better-qualified workforce and to attract new businesses
to the region, state officials have funded an array of higher education
facilities.
North Rhine-Westphalia now has 50 universities and vocational training
centres, most of them located around the urban centres of the Ruhr.
Moreover, there are 10 branches of the famous Max Planck Research Institute,
five branches from the similar Fraunhofer Society and 24 technology-transfer
offices regrouped in three state-run research centres.
State officials view this educational framework as vital support for the
region's industrial diversification. In the city of Dortmund alone, the
eight-year-old technology transfer institute is believed to have created
more than 1,000 jobs for the town in the last three years.
The aim is to provide job opportunities as much for today as for the years
ahead - 'there is a generation problem,' explains Ms Anke Brunn, state
minister for science and research. 'We don't expect miners to start
manufacturing computer chips. But their sons and daughters - they are
studying in preparation for new technologies. That is a crucialstep for a
properous future.'
To qualify for state funds, universities have to offer programmes
specifically geared for new regional industries.
For example, the vocational training centre which opened last year in
Gelsenkirchen offers teaching in waste management and in engineering - two
important growth areas in the Ruhr.
The Fachhochschule-Gelsenkirchen, which is the latest (and 50th) centre to
open in the Ruhr, now trains 2,000 students and hopes to increase this
number to 3,000 next year - 'we teach engineers how to sell engineering
products because this will be as important in the future as manufacturing
itself,' explains Mr Peter Schulte, the rector.
The centre is also geared toward training people to be active on an
international level. It is, for example, holding talks with Britain's Hallam
University in Sheffield about a student exchange programme.
Mr Schulte admits, however, that much remains to be done to have education
meet the needs of the industries in the Ruhr. Critics claim that vocational
training is often removed from the realities of the workplace, not least
because some professors, who are civil servants enjoying lifetime employment
with little incentive to reform the curriculum.
Moreover, few educational centres offer flexible programme schedules for
workers needing mid-career retraining - 'most people who want to change
their professions or who need to increase their qualifications must leave
their jobs in order to attend a university,' explains Mr Schulte.
For Ms Brunn, the minister, education has to become more of a partnership
between private and public sectors. Companies must increasingly focus on
ways to increase staff training to meet technological change, she says.
'We need to introduce greater flexibility in work schedules to allow people
to take evening classes and to retrain while they are working.'
Some convenient courses have started. For example, at Bochum University,
built, symbolically perhaps, above an old, abandoned coal mine, strong
emphasis has been put on Russian and Japanese language courses, scheduled at
convenient hours for working people. But such examples remain all too rare,
officials admit.
These facilities can serve as models for other areas of the country. This
autumn there will be fresh discussions at government level on ways to
improve links between educational establishments and the labour market.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (8): An exclusive club -
Pressures on regional power suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA KNIGHT

<TEXT>
THE RUHR region boasts the headquarters of two leading electricity
utilities, RWE Energie in Essen and VEW in Dortmund. Both companies belong
to an exclusive club for utilities owning the high voltage grid, the
Deutsche Verbundgesellschaft.
RWE Energie is the most powerful of the nine club members, with a high
voltage grid four times the length of VEW's. RWE was founded in Essen in the
heart of the Ruhr region in 1898 by Hugo Stinnes, the famous industrialist
known to competitors as 'the black-bearded Assyrian,' who emerged after
World War I as Germany's 'Business Kaiser,' controlling coal mines, steel
mills, banks, newspapers, hotels, shipping lines - and electrical plants.
RWE, partially communally-owned, steadily expanded and evolved over the
decades to become Germany's largest electricity utility. In 1990, the
company was restructured to form the RWE Holding in which utility RWE
Energie constitutes just one of six sectors.
The other big electricity utility in the Ruhr was set up in the 1920s: the
Vereinigte Elektrizitaetswerke Westfalen (VEW), based in Dortmund. VEW was
formed by the fusion of several communally owned regional supply companies.
Shortly afterwards, VEW and RWE signed an 'electro-peace treaty' - a
demarcation contract - agreeing not to trespass upon each others' territory.
Such contracts, allowed as exceptions under German competition law, now
exist between all nine 'Verbund' utilities.
Today, VEW is west Germany's fourth largest utility in terms of electricity
sales. It has rapidly expanding gas distribution and waste disposal sectors.
Both RWE and VEW are partly publicly owned, with anachronistic multiple
voting rights giving the communal shareholders an influence
disproportionately large in view of their minority capital shares.
With electricity sales falling - VEW sales were down 1.6 oer cent in 1992,
RWE-Energie sales down by 3 per cent in 1992-93 - the utilities have a
growth problem. Potential in east Germany and eastern Europe exists, but it
is developing very slowly.
Strong talk by the European Commission and the German Federal Cartel Office
(FCO) over the introduction of more competition in the electricity sector
have added impetus to a trend in which smaller utilities seek to hitch
themselves up with larger ones.
The 'minnows' hope that if and when the free-for-all for electricity
customers begins, this overlapping of interests will prevent the large
utilities from snapping up all their lucrative customers. The pattern does
not stop here - even the larger utilities are consolidating their positions.
And the FCO in Berlin appears to have only limited power to stop this trend.
A warning came from the chairman of RWE, Dr. Friedhelm Gieske this April:
'Competition within the energy sectors, bound by cable or pipeline
transmission, will inevitably lead to concentration so that the large
companies will become ever bigger. This would ultimately help us, but would
be a political mistake and therefore is not something we want.'
Recent developments in the Ruhr illustrate the creeping concentration in the
electricity sector. The city of Dortmund has a concession contract, expiring
in 1994, under which VEW is its exclusive electricity supplier. Initially,
the Dortmund municipal Stadtwerke dreamed of taking over the city
electricity supply. However, sobered by VEW's demands for a payment of
around DM1bn for the Dortmund transmission grid, the Stadtwerke agreed to a
compromise. VEW and the Stadtwerke will found a joint supply company,
Dortmunder Energie und Wasserverorgung (DEW) for the electricity, gas,
district heating and water supply to the city.
The FCO has approved the deal but imposed two conditions. First, the
contract is valid for only 20 years. Second, VEW is not allowed to use its
minority voting rights to influence Stadtwerke Dortmund decisions over the
source of DEW electricity supplies. In fact, the choice of supplier is very
limited anyway. The only alternative to VEW is the regional utility
Elektromark, in Hagen. And the Stadtwerke has already decided to continue
taking electricity from VEW.
The FCO's attempt to preserve an element of competition is weak. Observers
wonder if Dortmund is likely to change suppliers after 20 years of
co-operating with VEW - and if Elektromark still be around in 20 years, in
any case. Elektromark's supervisory and executive boards have strongly
recommended linking up with RWE Energie and VEW by selling each of them a 10
per cent block of shares. The link with RWE-Energie is designed to intensify
co-operation in the electricity sector, the connection with VEW serving
links in the waste disposal sector. Elektromark is also selling its 300MW
share in the Emsland nuclear power station in equal shares to RWE-Energie
and second largest German utility, Preussenelektra, to the discomfort of VEW
which owns the other 75 per cent.
Such manoeuvres are by no means limited to the Ruhr. Elsewhere in Germany
the larger utilities are also consolidating their positions. The Bavarian
Bayernwerk is moving rapidly closer to a merger with the Viag Group.
IN Baden-Wuerttemberg, utilities Badenwerk and Energie-Versorgung Schwaben
have been permitted by the FCO to merge on the grounds that there was no
competition between the two anyway. Other smaller electricity companies want
to join, too. They fear that if the electricity sector were liberalised
there would otherwise be little to stop Badenwerk/EVS taking their best
customers.
Hannover has decided to sell 40 per cent of its municipal utility. Twenty
per cent goes to German gas giant, Ruhrgas, also based in Essen. Thuega, a
subsidiary of the giant Veba which also owns utility Preussenelektra, is
taking the other 20 per cent. The link with Thuega could help stave off
potential future threats from Preussenelektra to win the Hannover utility's
big customers, such as Volkswagen and Continental.
In the Ruhr, the FCO would undoubtedly fight hard to prevent a VEW merger
with another utility. But as VEW slips down the pecking order of 'Verbund'
companies and is sandwiched between the supply areas of RWE and
Preussenelektra, observers wonder how long will it be before it, too,
decides the electricity business is best carried out 'in co-operation' with
a stronger partner.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (7): Solar showpiece arises -
Rheinelbe Science Park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE key to the character of the Rheinelbe Science Park, now being built on
the site of the former Thyssen crude steel works in Gelsenkirchen, will lie
on the roof.
Two enormous glass sails will rise from the twin towers of the new building,
and along its entire 350 metre-length will march serried ranks of three
metre-square glass panels.
The whole complex will add up to the largest roof-based solar power plant
yet to be built in Germany, and the plan is to provide all the communal
power needs of the 17,000 square metre building from the sun.
Professor Dieter Otten, the chief executive of the science park, who thought
up the idea, and pushed it through, sees it as a natural development of the
history of the Ruhr region.
'For years we have been producing solar energy in fossil form - coal,' he
says. 'That has the added disadvantage that it produces carbon dioxide.
'The science park, linked to the Ruhr's tradition of energy production, will
show we can produce a technology for the future, out of future energy.'
He admits that it was hard to persuade the backers of the science park - the
North Rhine-Westphalian state government, the Emscher Park international
building exhibition, and local industry - to support his investment. 'The
idea did not have many supporters. It was opposed particularly by the people
representing traditional technology.'
Professor Otten had, however, a second line of attack: the solar energy
panels could be produced in Gelsenkirchen itself, in precisely the sort of
public-private sector co-operation which the science park is designed to
promote. The panels will be produced by Flachglas, the Pilkington
glass-making subsidiary in the town, and designed by Flagsol, its solar
energy subsidiary. The other partner in the venture is Britain's BP, which
produces the photo-voltaic cells used in the solar panels.
That appeared to clinch the plan. Now the entire science park is intended to
be focussed particularly on all possible uses and development of solar
energy.
'The solar energy power plant will be our external symbol,' Professor Otten
says. 'Our aim is to attract as many people here as possible, to set up
training programmes and seminars on the uses of solar energy. We expect
masses of solar energy tourists to come visiting.'
Among the first occupants of the science park will be an institute for
applied photo-voltaic technology, as well as an organisation appropriately
called Zeus - the centre for energy conversion and storage.
Forty per cent of the DM7.5m costs will be borne by the European Community's
research programme, and 10 per cent by North Rhine-Westphalia. The future
tenants are expected to finance the difference.
Mr Joachim Benemann, chief executive of Flagsol, is quite clear why he, and
Flachglas, are involved. 'Our aim is simply to find all possible ways of
increasing the sale of glass,' he says. The company has now set up a special
production unit in Gelsenkirchen to produce the panels, using a special
technique of pouring resin between two panes of glass to seal the solar
cells in place.
'I was not convinced it was going to work,' he said. 'The breakthrough has
yet to come in Europe. Some say it is too expensive, and that we don't have
enough sun. But it's a technology that no one can criticise.'
Which is no doubt why the unlikely site of the industrial heart of the Ruhr
region has been chosen for such a high-profile experiment in solar power
generation. 'We want to prove that it is a perfectly effective, conventional
source of power,' Professor Otten says. 'The EC wants to use it as a
demonstration project, to show how the latest technology can be
intelligently used in the public grid.
'The demonstration effect will be much greater than if it were buried
somewhere in the countryside. You will have a power plant, a manufacturer,
and an institute for applied solar energy, all in the same spot. What more
can you ask for, if you are studying uses of solar energy?'

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (4): A fight for survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH German coal mines reducing their output, the medium-sized companies
which produce mining equipment in the Ruhr are set for a fight for survival,
writes Ariane Genillard.
One move to boost business has been to establish a consortium to sell mining
equipment in Russia. But in order to solve the problem of the Russian
companies' lack of hard currency, a barter deal will be brokered by Raab
Karcher, the diversified trading arm of Veba, the Dusseldorf-based energy
group.
Raab Karcher, which had a turnover of DM10.5bn in 1992, is interested in
developing business links in the former Soviet republics. It has recently
signed a contract to import 350,000 tonnes of coal from the Karagandaugol
mine in Kazakhstan. Proceeds from coal sales, to be marketed mostly in
Germany, the UK and France, will partially go toward repaying the German
enterprises delivering mining equipment in Russia.
The barter deal, which will be partially financed with subsidies from the
state of North Rhine-Westphalia, aims to give a boost to small mining
equipment producers by opening new markets for them in eastern Europe.
Manufacturers of mining equipment and spare parts are struggling to cope
with falling orders as German mines plan to reduce hard coal capacity from
the current 65.5m tonnes output to an estimated 50m tonnes by the year 2005.
For Raab Karcher, the local market for imported coal could grow, however.
German utilities and steel groups are contractually obliged to buy coal from
the Ruhr valley at the subsidised price of DM288.
Meanwhile, imports of hard coal, which last year reached 14m tonnes, can be
sold to smaller industrial users at prices ranging between DM70 and DM80 - a
market which Raab Karcher hopes to tap into.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (2): Industrial clean-up on a
grand scale - Ruhr Valley becomes a world centre for developing
environmental technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH 2,300 enterprises involved in environmental technologies, the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia is home to 25 per cent of all German companies
working in this sector. Two-thirds of these businesses are located in the
Ruhr itself - and a third of them were launched within the last 10 years.
For Mr Klaus Matthiesen, environment minister for North Rhine-Westphalia,
this development is a good indication of the way Ruhr industry is being
restructured.
'Our concern for the environment is a major factor in creating new jobs,' he
says. More than 150,000 people now work in environment-related industries.
The Ruhr has proved to be a leading area for companies wanting to diversify
into environmental technology. According to Mr Matthiessen, DM6bn will have
been invested by 4,500 companies in the region to meet environmental air
standards alone, between 1990 and 1994.
This follows DM13bn invested in clean air technology between 1983 and 1989
when the level of dioxide emissions in the region was cut by 80 per cent.
With three times the population density of other German states and the
largest concentration of heavy industries in Europe, North Rhine-Westphalia
has been at the forefront new environmental standards in Germany.
Much remains to be done to make the Ruhr a clean place, however. There are
still 3,500 abandoned industrial sites which are thought to be polluted. But
great progress has been achieved over the last 20 years - 'the bulk of the
cleaning-up in the Ruhr is done,' says Mr Mattiesen. 'The market created by
strict environmental standards has fostered an industry which, today, is at
the leading edge of environmental technology.'
'Efforts are now focussed on pollution prevention, rather than just
repairing past damage.'
Investment in clean-up projects reached a peak in 1987-88. Companies in the
region anticipate big opportunities for exporting environmental equipment
and services. The Ruhr is home to some of the largest names in the business,
including Thyssen, Babcock and Steinmuller. Thyssen, for example, achieved
sales of nearly DM2bn in 1991-1992 with products and services for reducing
pollutants. Its subsidiary, Thyssen Engineering, makes equipment for
desulphurisation and the removal of nitrogen in power plants and garbage
incinerators. Thyssen Sonnenberg has been active in recycling activites,
including the running of one of the largest shredder plants for scrap metal
in Germany. Babcock has also been a leading player in the sector for 25
years, having installed dozens of waste incineration plants across the
country. Meanwhile, new projects are under way which will strengthen the
Ruhr as a leading centre for environmental technology. For example, in
Duisburg, in the heart of the region, RWE, the German power group, plans to
build one of Europe's largest waste-recycling plants. Construction begins
next year and the complex could be operational by 1997. The investment,
funded by RWE and Thyssen Handelsunion, is estimated at DM600bn. The aim of
the two companies is to position themselves as the most cost-efficient
recyclers in Germany. The project aims to take advantage of strict 'green
laws' being considered by the government to force manufacturers of consumer
goods to recycle most of their waste products.
Clearly, this type of project is an important boost for regional
subcontractors. According to Mr Michael Stock, technical director, at least
48 per cent of the investment goes to German companies while the rest is
handled by foreign enterprises. However, these highly-automated plants
provide relatively few jobs in the Ruhr. The entire plant will employ less
than 200 people.
'Structural changes in the Ruhr won't solve the problem of unemployment from
former heavy industries,' says Mr Matthiesen. 'The jobs lost in the steel
mills and coal mines will not be replaced by companies producing
environmental technology.'
According to a study by the Westdeusche Landesbank, more than half of the
environment-related companies employ less than 100 people - and 86 per cent
of them have less than 500 workers.
For Mr Matthiesen believes it is important that tax advantages - begun in
the 1970s - are re-introduced for companies investing in cleaner industrial
environments.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (3): Diversifying into new
areas - The coal industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD news is not new at Ruhrkohle. Producing 80 per cent of Germany's hard
coal output, the state-subsidised company has had to cope in the last three
years with the twin problems of domestic recession and empty state coffers.
Declining industrial orders from steel mills and a slowdown in electricity
consumption have sparked a political debate which could revise the company's
planned output level and which threatens to accelerate the coal mine
closures.
Under the restructuring plan, 12,000 jobs are due to go within the next two
years. But job cuts could double, according to the company's estimates, as a
result of falling output in the steel industry, plus calls in Bonn for a cut
in state subsidies to support the Ruhr coal production.
However, a bright spot can be found in Ruhrkohle's attempts to prove itself
as a viable competitor in non-coal areas. While 98 per cent of Ruhrkohle's
turnover came from coal mining 20 years ago, the company has diversified -
39 per cent of its business is now in environmental technology, trading,
power engineering and construction.
Steag, its largest non-coal subsidiary, operates power plants for district
heating and offers related environmental and engineering services, and has
seen profits rise in the last three years. Steag employs 4,500 people and
had a turnover of DM3.5bn last year.
Engineering services offered by Steag have been particularly profitable,
rising by 13 per cent last year to DM48m. Waste management for power plants
also increased by 15 per cent in 1992 to DM102m.
Steag has also made advances in ventilation and clean-air technology.
Following aggressive marketing abroad, especially in the US and Asia, orders
for these divisions increased last year by 23 per cent and turnover rose by
48 per cent.
Growth is also under way for Ruhrkohle Umwelt which specialises in waste
management. The subsidiary, with 1,500 employees, reported a turnover of
DM525m last year; profits for the four-year-old company were DM14m.
Ruhrkohle's turnover this year is expected to reach DM900m as the company
increases its stakes to majority ownership in the Richard Buchen company,
which specialises in waste disposal and Weber Umwelttechnik, a
Baden-Wurttemberg waste management company. Ruhrkohle Umwelt also plans to
invest DM400m in new plants.
A significant investment will go toward developing a recycling plant for
plastics in Bottrop, which involves energy recovery for a oil refinery run
by Veba, the large Dusseldorf-based power group. There, Ruhrkohle Umwelt
intends to tap into the lively growth area of plastic recycling, for which
Germany has the highest quotas in Europe.
Plans include increasing plastic recycling capacity from 12,000 to 40,000
tonnes. With more than a million tonnes of plastic waste produced each year
in Germany, officials at Ruhrkhole Umwelt are confident about the returns on
such an investment.
Another growth area for Ruhrkohle Umwelt lies in the cleaning up of
contaminated sites. Last year, it cleaned up more than 80,000 tonnes of
contaminated soil; and abroad, it is researching ways to clean-up
war-damaged areas of Kuwait.
Meanwhile, with Ruhrkohle's traditional coal business facing increased
difficulties, the company's newer non-coal subsidiaries are setting their
sights on potential markets in eastern Germany.
Steag, for instance, is involved in supplying district heating in the town
of Zwickau where it is collaborating with RWE and Bayernwerk, two of the
largest west German utility groups. Steag will also modernising power
supplies in the town of Leuna where it is building a gas and steam turbine
co-generation plant.
Similarely, Ruhrkohle has positioned its environmental subsidiaries to
become a key player in eastern parts of the country. There, Ruhrkohle Umwelt
plans to increase its turnover from DM70m to DM90m. It is also participating
in the biggest clean-up operation for the region's brown coal fields.
But the bright prospects of Ruhrkohle's non-coal subsidiaries have been
dampened by the plight of Germany's coal industry.
While sales in non-coal operations are expanding, this success is not in
labour-intensive areas which could offset job losses in the coal business.
Moreover, growth is also taking place mainly outside the Ruhr region.
A three-year-old subsidiary of Ruhrkohle now offers vocational teaching for
6,000 employees a year, of whom 3,500 are workers involved in projects in
eastern Germany.
These schemes, however, are of little help to the 12,000 workers which are
due to leave the company by the end of 1995. The diversification of the
company provides relatively small compensation for the problems in the coal
sector, which remains its core business.
Ruhrkohle had further bad news from the steel sector this summer. The
company is now negotiating with leading German steelmakers who want to
renege on a contract to buy coke and coking coal from Ruhrkohle until the
year 2000. The contract was originally devised as a lifeline for the
company, whose subsidised coal and coke is too expensive to be competitive
abroad.
Despite its progress in non-coal areas, Ruhrkohle remains irrevocably tied
to the future of coal-mining. The Ruhr itself faces a tough challenge in
absorbing the job losses following the closure of mines. The figures are
revealing: in 1970, more than 191,000 people worked in the Ruhr's mining
industry; a decade later this had fallen to 140,000; then to 100,000 in
1990. Today the total is down to 89,000.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (1): Innovation in Germany's
industrial heartland - Planners are diversifying away from traditional heavy
industries, such as coal and steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SIX years ago, in the winter of 1987, the steelworkers of the mighty Krupp
industrial empire took to the streets of the Ruhr region to protest against
the planned closure of their steel plant at Rheinhausen.
For them, the proposed closure of that 100-year-old integrated steelworks
was the last straw in three decades of decline in the traditional industries
which had made the Ruhr the cradle of Germany's industrial revolution.
It was a protest which sparked a nationwide response. The steelworkers and
coalminers of the Ruhr held a candlelit vigil which stretched from Duisburg
to Dortmund, from west to east of the region which remains the greatest
industrial agglomeration in Germany.
The protest marked a turning point for the region. Sympathy and support
poured in. Not merely the politicians, but the business community was
galvanised into action. Krupp reversed its decision to close Rheinhausen,
and 2,000 jobs were saved.
This year, the steel crisis has struck again, and the plant at Rheinhausen
has closed for good. And yet this time round, the protests have been
half-hearted, and the national sympathy decidedly muted. The mood on the
Ruhr has changed.
One reason may be sheer exhaustion. The inevitability of a radical
restructuring of Germany's steel industry, efficient though it is in west
European terms, has finally percolated through to the labour force. There is
also a realisation that in the depths of a national recession, and with the
huge burden of rebuilding a united Germany weighing on the public purse, the
Ruhrgebiet is on its own.
Another reason is more hopeful: the experience of the past six years has
shown that there is another alternative for the Ruhr to its traditional
industries. Not only are new industries springing up in place of the old,
such as environmental enterprises created to clean up the damage of the
past, but the coal and steel giants are themselves diversifying.
There is a new mood of determination to prove that the Ruhr valley, the last
and most modern of Europe's heavy industrial heartlands, can find a new
lease of life.
What happened after the first Rheinhausen crisis was critical. Three
important initiatives were launched to give new impetus to the painful
restructuring process, and ease the transition from the steady decline of
coal mining, iron and steel to new industries providing the guarantee of new
jobs for the 5.5m population.
For the first time in years, the whole business community lined up with the
state government to reverse the decline. Thirty-five leading businessmen
joined forces to found the Initiativkreis Ruhrgebiet, each contributing
DM1.5m to a lobby group intended to transform the grimy image of the area,
and revive its self-confidence.
'The business community said: 'We cannot leave it all up to the
politicians,'' says Dr Elke Esser, director of the organisation. Led by the
late Mr Alfred Herrhausen, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, they committed
themselves to step up their own investments in the region, and to launch a
series of high profile cultural and sporting events to put the Ruhr back on
the international map.
At the same time, the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia launched
its own Zukunftsinitiative Montanregionen, or initiative for the future of
the coal and steel regions. For the first time, the plan abandoned the
long-running effort to preserve the industrial structure of the region, and
sought instead to promote innovation, new technologies and new training to
replace the old industries.
The state government also threw its weight behind another ambitious project
to blend the old structures of the Ruhr with the new: the Emscher Park
international building exhibition, a 10-year programme, covering 17 towns
and 2m people, to transform the most depressed part of the region into a
place worth living and working in.
Perhaps it was more good fortune than design, but the launch of those
initiatives co-incided with a turning point in the local economy.
Unemployment, which had been rising steadily in the region from a low point
of less than one per cent in 1970, peaked at more than 15 per cent in 1987
and 1988. Since then it has slowly declined, although it still remains over
11 per cent, well above the national average.
The net emigration of the population also ceased, and a new inflow of
immigrants - mostly German-speakers returning from eastern Europe - reversed
the trend. New jobs were being created fast enough not only to reduce
unemployment, but to absorb new market entrants, too. Between 1965 and 1985,
total employment in the region fell from 2.37m to 1.92m.
From 1985 to 1991, 237,200 net new jobs were created.
That is not to say the challenge is not huge. In the past 30 years, the
region has lost more than 100,000 steel jobs, and some 240,000 in the coal
mines alone. Latest forecasts by the RWI economic research institute in
Essen suggest that 50,000 more will be lost by the steel industry in the
coming years.
Coal mining production has tumbled from 115.4m tonnes in 1960 to barely 50m
tonnes today. That level of production still depends on massive state
subsidies, through the so-called 'coal penny' imposed on household
electricity bills. The whole basis of the subsidy system is under review,
with pressure from Brussels to phase it out rapidly.
On top of that threat, the competition for new investment from the former
east Germany has been intense. And yet the promoters of the region are
remarkably sanguine.
'We won't have much chance this year and next to attract new investments,
because most enterprises have spare capacity,' says Mr Gerd Frohlich, chief
executive of the Emscher-Lippe agency, responsible for promoting the north
of the region, the real heartland of coal mining. 'I don't see much
competition with the east just now, but the reason is there is no demand.
Normally, for capital intensive investment, we would have no chance. The
advantages in the new federal states are much more obvious. They can offer
double the level of direct subsidies. But we can offer planning certainty.
We can get building approval within six weeks. We can offer suppliers very
good connections, a good technical basis, and trained personnel.'
He believes that for foreign investors, like the Japanese, it is planning
certainty, and the reliability of the local partner, which is more important
than the immediate cost of an investment. He also suggests the Ruhr must
think long-term: 'It's not just a matter of attracting big investors. We
must go for small businesses, and we must promote co-operation with our
universities. We must do more to make the region attractive for higher
qualified people. We have a very well developed green infrastructure, and a
wealth of cultural facilities. Everything is there. But we lack good housing
for highly qualified workers.'
Ironically, she believes part of the problem is that property prices are too
low - 'you pay DM2,000 a square metre in Munich, DM1,000 in Frankfurt, and
DM800 in Dresden. Here you can pay as little as DM50 to DM100 a square
metre.'
That means private developers are not attracted. Yet in spite of the scale
of the challenge, indeed perhaps because of it, the Ruhr is looking up.
'Within a very short time, the region has become attractive for investors
because of its human potential and an affordable quality of life,' according
to Prof. Klaus Kunzmann, of Dortmund University's planning institute. 'For
others, it is an innovative laboratory of regional change. The Ruhrgebiet is
no longer a loser, a place to avoid.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Breathing Liffe into
equity options - How to revive interest in an established product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do you increase sales of a product which has been around for years and
which has failed to do as well as other, competing brands?
Manufacturers of washing-up liquid or soap powder can quickly reach millions
of potential buyers with television or radio commercials. But these forms of
advertising are uneconomic and inappropriate for products which are very
specialised and only appeal to a small audience.
This is the challenge facing Liffe, London's financial futures and options
exchange, which is trying to stimulate new interest in equity options after
inheriting the product last year through its merger with London's traded
options market.
Equity options - which give holders the right, but not the obligation, to
buy or sell at a fixed price - started trading on the London Stock Exchange
in 1978. In spite of the deregulation of the securities industry in the
1980s and the wide ownership of shares in the UK, however, they failed to
attract enough interest to justify their own trading floor.
By contrast, equity options have been far more successful in continental
Europe and in Scandinavia, where the level of investment in shares is
relatively low. Liffe, which is the largest financial futures and options
exchange outside Chicago, believes it should be able to bring the UK level
closer to those of the Continent and Scandinavia.
One of the first things Liffe discovered from its market research was that
in the US and in the Netherlands, it is the retail investor, and not the
institutional client, who is responsible for about 70 per cent of trading
volume in these instruments.
In the UK, the situation is the reverse, with private investors estimated to
contribute less than 20 per cent of total equity and index option volume.
Developing this retail segment is essential if trading in equity options is
to grow substantially, says Karin Forseke, in charge of equity products at
Liffe.
She has taken steps to make equity options more accessible to the public.
Prices of individual equity options are now available on the BBC's teletext
facility, Ceefax. In the first week of transmission, Liffe received 1,500
telephone calls about equity options.
Retail investors were also given priority when Liffe conducted a review of
individual equity options. The Exchange dropped four existing options and
in-troduced eight new ones, leaving 70 equity options which better reflect
the composition of retail and institutional portfolio holdings.
Liffe has also introduced monthly seminars for private clients and has
published booklets on how to use equity options. It is also improving its
technology to facilitate trading.
With these changes in place, Forseke and her colleagues have been visiting
private-client stockbrokers in London and the provinces to encourage them,
and their clients, to trade in equity options.
The programme is being extended to the big financial institutions, to
persuade them to use equity options to enhance the performance of their
funds.
Liffe does not expect investors, large and small, to change their habits
overnight, but aims to double trading volume of equity options within two
years. Currently, just over 1m contracts (a contract specifies the quantity
of the item and the time of delivery or payment) are traded each quarter.
Trading in equity options reached a high of 3.1m contracts in the second
quarter of 1987, just before the global stock market crash which occurred
that October.
While a volume-based target is probably the most widely perceived measure of
success, Forseke believes that other goals are equally important.
These range from a substantial increase in the use of equity options by
institutional and private clients, to increased liquidity in individual
equity options.
If these goals are not met by the summer of 1995, is that the end of equity
options in the UK? No, says Forseke, Liffe will have to find other ways to
make equity options realise their potential.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hey, young spender -
US companies are bidding for the custom of twenty-somethings and teenagers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are the US manufacturer of a product with an old-fashioned image.
Teenagers and people in their twenties do not want to 'check it out'. It is
not cool. It is the antithesis of radical. How do you change their
perceptions?
This problem, common to many businesses, was addressed by two US companies
last week when they announced significant changes in image.
Chrysler, the car maker which until recently came over as rather stodgy,
unveiled a small car, called the Neon, which it will introduce to the US
market in January. The Neon will be aimed directly at the group of consumers
dubbed Generation X or the 'baby busters' by the marketing industry - young
adults between the ages of 18 and 30.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products company, announced a relaunch of Old
Spice, which is America's best-selling men's after-shave but suffers from an
image problem: young men think of it as something found in their father's
bathroom cabinet - one of the least hip places on earth. P&amp;G aims to
eradicate such negative connotations.
Generation X is notorious in the marketing industry for being hard to sell
to. Its members, many of whom have suffered long periods of unemployment,
are supposed to be cynical, iconoclastic, unresponsive to traditional
advertising techniques and lacking in brand loyalty.
However, after extensive market research into the views of the age group,
Chrysler has come up with a more positive interpretation. The company
believes it is a generation which seeks 'simplicity, integrity, substance
and genuineness in its lifestyles.' It is environmentally conscious and has
far less desire for show and materialism than the baby boomers who preceded
it. It has very high product expectations and is open to new suppliers, if
they can deliver the best quality.
In the 1980s Chrysler had a reputation for producing dull, boxy cars and, in
common with the rest of the Detroit motor industry, it lost many baby
boomers, now in their 30s and 40s, to Japanese rivals. Over the past 12
months, Chrysler has started winning back market share in the family-sized
car market, thanks to a series of new vehicles of startlingly different
design. The Neon is its attempt to carry this momentum into the crowded
small-car market, where buyers between the ages of 24 and 30 account for
roughly 50 per cent of US sales.
Chrysler is keeping its advertising ideas secret, but recent US campaigns by
rival car companies targeting Generation X have used off-beat humour and
rock music, together with claims that their vehicles are less boring than
other cars and better value for money. Chrysler seems likely to reiterate
many of these themes.
Chrysler's publicity machine is presenting the Neon as stylish, low-cost,
roomy, fast-accelerating and environmentally friendly. (It is at least 85
per cent recyclable). With its big bug-eyed headlamps and a bubble shaped
top, the car is 'huggable,' maintains the company.
That is a quality to which Old Spice might also lay claim. Its TV
advertisements have long featured the 'mariner man' - a whistling sailor
with a magnetic power over women. He would toss a bottle of Old Spice to
some poor land-lubber unable to attract the ladies.
Old Spice has had a nautical theme ever since the line was introduced in the
1930s. A logo of a classic clipper ship graces its packaging and bottle.
P&amp;G, which acquired the brand three years ago, is updating the image by
getting rid of the mariner and replacing the clipper logo with a racing
yacht. It is coupling this with the launch of two products aimed at young
men.
Its research found many young men do not like the burning sensation of
traditional after-shaves. This stinging is produced by the alcohol used as
an antiseptic against shaving cuts. However, modern razor technology means
fewer facial nicks and thus little need for the alcohol.
P&amp;G is introducing an alcohol-free after-shave, and a long-lasting 'high
endurance' deodorant, both targeted at the under 30s. The TV advertisement
for the deodorant shows a young man winning a cycle race and being embraced
by his admiring woman. The only nautical reference is a short shot of a
large, breaking wave at the end of the advertisement.
Old Spice is changing its image by sponsoring sports, notably beach
volleyball, a fast-growing televised game in the US, featuring lithe
athletes clad in swimming costumes and dark glasses.
Jon Hall, the brand's associate advertising manager, claims none of this is
alienating Old Spice's older users, since 'we have retained the features
that they identify with the mariner man.' Perhaps.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): In a league of their
own
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Campaign, the British advertising industry's weekly publication, celebrates
its 25th anniversary this week. It has been digging into its archives and
tomorrow publishes a league table of the top creative agencies. Ranking is
based on how many awards agencies have collected over the years.
Saatchi and Saatchi heads the list (current work includes British Airways
and Silk Cut). Next are: Collett Dickenson Pearce (Benson and Hedges, Parker
pens); Boase Massimi Pollitt (VW, Heinz); and Abbott Mead Vickers (Volvo and
Sainsbury's). The full list of 25 includes some agencies which are no longer
on the scene.
But how meaningful is it to rank agencies according to the prizes the
industry awards itself? The answer, as far as the agencies are concerned, is
that who wins which award is of consuming interest. The rest of the world
would probably be unwise to use awards as a basis for measuring anything.
Dominic Mills, Campaign editor, says an award-winning campaign has:
originality; relevance to the product and target market; impact; and wit.
Some clients do enjoy working with prizewinners, but the main rewards seem
to be enhanced internal morale and increased opportunity to draw in creative
talent from outside.
The competitions that Campaign has tracked include the Cannes awards,
advertising's equivalent of the film festival, the Designers' and Art
Directors' competition and Campaign's press and poster awards. All the
competitions measure creativity, rather than effectiveness. Mills says there
are 'a hundred and one reasons why it's very difficult to measure
effectiveness. For example, brilliant advertising can be ruined by poor
distribution or uncompetitive pricing.'
Nevertheless, an attempt is made every two years by the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising to measure and reward effectiveness, with
'agencies producing lengthy papers to prove their point,' says Mills.
The IPA competition was not included by Campaign when it came to compiling
its league table, but there is some overlap, he says. Strong performers on
both counts, according to Mills are Boase Massimi Pollitt, Abbott Mead
Vickers and Bartle Bogle Hegarty.
There may have been no shocks at the top of the league table, but Mills says
it was a 'little surprising' to see D'Arcy Masius Benton and Bowles, and
Still Price Lintas featuring further down at numbers 22 and 24 respectively.
Surprising, says Mills, because they are 'large multinational client-based'
agencies. Such agencies 'largely don't produce award-winning work, but
they've turned out to be more creative than people think,' he says.
The multinational client is more likely to produce advertising by committee
and to be conservative, says Mills. If your advertisement is aimed at the
dull old 'housewife buyer' of, for example, washing powders or fish fingers,
you are less likely to be able to collect a creative award. More promising
territory is 'the bright youth market or the thirty-somethings who are ad
literate and sophisticated,' says Mills.

QUANTEC, a provider of investment technology services, is hoping to
capitalise on the growing interest among UK fund managers for quantitative
applications in stock selection and asset allocation.
It has hired Bruce Pullman, formerly of County NatWest Investment Services -
and very briefly at Hill Samuel Asset Management - to head a new investment
management consultancy service. The service will help traditional fund
managers to incorporate some arithmetic approaches into their product and
understand their own performance better.
Pullman moved to CNWIM in 1981 where he set up the bank's quantitative fund
management team. Earlier this year, he was recruited to head a team at Hill
Samuel, but left after two months following disagreements over the scope of
his brief; he said his departure was amicable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Heron, the longest-serving director of James Capel, is cutting loose
after 34 years to head up Smith New Court's equity derivatives operation on
January 1.
Michael Marks, Smith's chief executive, says Heron will be given a 'blank
piece of paper' to develop the company's global equity derivatives business.
'We were surprised that he left (Capel),' he said, but we were keen to gain
his expertise on the sorts of derivative instruments clients want in
different parts of the world.
Heron previously ran Capel's derivatives unit, but following the Hongkong
Bank takeover, the derivatives business at Midland and Capel has been
increasingly decentralised, with, for example, UK equity derivatives moved
to the domain of stock trading.
Recently his projects at Capel have included a scheme to raise corporate
capital for the Lloyds insurance market.

The fate of the Occupational Pensions Board hangs in the balance while the
government's advisory body on occupational pensions, the Goode Committee,
debates the future regulatory framework.
The new chairman, Harriet Dawes, partner at Lovell White Durrant and a
specialist in pensions law, acknowledges that she is in a caretaker role.
Dawes, currently OPB deputy chairman, has been appointed to head the body
until the end of the year following the retirement of Sir Jeremy Rowe.
Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is to make a further announcement
after reviewing the Goode Committee's recommendations, due to be submitted
by the end of the month. For her part, Dawes says she is far too busy to
take on the duties of the OPB permanently even if the body were to continue
in its present form. But by all accounts, it will not.
Dawes herself advocates a new regulatory structure and says that unlike the
OPB, it should have powers to publicise wrongdoing, set fines or even revoke
authorisation to run a scheme. 'If there is to be a regulator, it has got to
be clear about whom it is trying to protect; government, members or the
industry,' she says.

FT  16 SEP 93 / People: McNeil to head Bull Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'auld alliance' between Scotland and France was reinforced this week
with the announcement that George McNeil, currently heading Groupe Bull of
France's UK operations, is to be president and chief executive of Bull
Europe.
He is the latest British computer boss, tempered in the heat of the UK
recession, to be singled out for greater things in foreign-owned companies.
Geoff Unwin, for example, head of Hoskyns, now has executive responsibility
for France's CGS, the UK company's parent.
From October 1, McNeil's fiefdom will include all of Bull's European
affiliates with the understandable exception of France.
He will be the first UK manager to have reached such an exalted level in
Bull, a very French operation, and the first to become a member of Bull's
group executive committee. It is 'a nice, meaty international job', says
McNeil, who reports to Bernard Pache, Bull's chairman and chief executive.
Pache, a newcomer to the computer industry, will no doubt lean heavily on
McNeil's experience. Now 50, the Edinburgh-educated Scot joined Honeywell in
1965 and progressed through the company in a variety of positions including
vice president of manufacturing, large companies division, in Phoenix,
Arizona.
He believes that Bull UK's early moves to standard systems and a service
mentality, setting an example for the rest of the organisation, must have
played a part in his latest promotion. His toughest task, cultural
differences apart, will be to change mental attitudes in a company which has
for so long seen the manufacturing of large computers as its principal
activity.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jack Lemley, chief executive of Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French
contractors building the Channel tunnel, will step down at the end of the
year after the Pounds 8.4bn project is handed over to Eurotunnel, the
publicly quoted tunnel operator.
The post will be filled by Haro Bedelian from Balfour Beatty who became
chief executive designate yesterday. Balfour Beatty is the construction arm
of BICC and one of 10 British and French companies making up TML.
Lemley, a US engineer, was appointed chief executive of Transmanche in 1989
as part of a series of management changes after relationships between
Eurotunnel and its contractors first became strained.
Over the following four years, Lemley was at the centre of negotiations
between Eurotunnel and Transmanche over the contractors' claims for extra
payments. In the process Lemley's relationship with Sir Alastair Morton,
Eurotunnel's chief executive, is understood to have become increasingly
difficult.
In May, Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, who had worked closely with
Lemley, stood down as the British co-chairman of Transmanche and was
succeeded by Neville Simms, Tarmac's chief executive. Finally, in July this
year, Eurotunnel and the contractors announced an agreement to end their
long conflict, setting a target date of December 10 for TML's handover of
the project to Eurotunnel and paving the way for a phased opening of the
tunnel next year.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Accountancy Column: In support of the profit and loss
account - Balance sheets should show the results of the company's
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RON PATERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board has been in operation for three years and is
fully into its stride. But I am worried that it may be striding in the wrong
direction. I believe its approach puts undue emphasis on the balance sheet,
to the detriment of the profit and loss account, and to the disadvantage of
users of accounts.
The board has now published all but one of the chapters of its draft
statement of principles. This is designed to provide a conceptual framework
on which to base future standards. In a political context it might also be
seen as a kind of manifesto, setting out the board's vision of accounting to
seek the endorsement of the business community. In these terms, it would not
attract my vote.
Perhaps more worryingly, there has been very little public debate on the
whole project, and there is a danger that we will end up with the framework
being adopted without many people realising what it entails.
The ASB's proposals implicitly make the balance sheet the central plank of
the financial statements, with the profit and loss account dependent upon
it. Financial statements are to be built around rules for the recognition
and measurement of assets and liabilities, not the allocation of
transactions to accounting periods by the matching of items of income and
expense.
Consistent with this perspective, the ASB appears to favour current
valuations in preference to historical costs. Their approach seems to be to
try to make the balance sheet more like a statement of wealth, with the
movement in net assets being the primary measure of performance. Financial
reporting, from this standpoint, is essentially an exercise in valuation.
I take a different view of the purpose of company accounts. I do not see
them as trying to value the business, or even to value its individual
assets, but simply as reporting the results of the transactions the company
has entered into. It is for the market-place to value businesses; it is the
role of accounts to provide some (and only some) of the information the
market needs for that purpose.
Companies are generally valued, not by reference to their assets, but on the
basis of the stream of cash flows which they are able to generate for their
stakeholders. The financial reporting priorities which are relevant to this
should focus on the profit and loss account more than the balance sheet.
This is in fact how accountants have traditionally approached the task of
preparing accounts: by analysing the transactions recorded in the company's
books and using the matching and prudence concepts to allocate them to
periods, not by conducting an inventory of its assets and liabilities.
Because of this different perspective, I see historical costs as possessing
a relevance which the ASB does not acknowledge. Historical costs represent
the amounts at the time a company's transactions were actually undertaken
and which gave rise to its actual cashflows. In contrast, current values are
often more in the realm of opportunity costs.
I agree that there can also be a place for current value systems of
accounting, but I see no need to abandon historical cost accounting as the
basis of the principal financial reporting model. In any case, it can always
be supplemented by valuation information in the form of additional note
disclosure if this is thought to be useful.
Perhaps memories are too short. Previous efforts to introduce systems of
current value accounting, both in this country and elsewhere, have been
unhappy experiences. The inflation accounting saga of the late 1970s and
early 1980s was generally regarded as an embarrassing fiasco and did
considerable harm to the standard setting process thereafter.
Valuations which are not verified by actual transactions are hypothetical
and sometimes too far fetched to have much relevance to the business whose
accounts are being presented. The business community's faith in the
reliability of property valuations has been shaken by the turmoil in market
conditions in the last few years, for instance, while the problems of
valuing assets such as brands are even greater.
Apart from these measurement issues, there are some other respects in which
the balance sheet and the profit and loss account approaches to accounting
diverge. This is because the ASB's proposed definitions of assets and
liabilities will sometimes create a conflict with the matching and prudence
concepts which form the basis of existing generally accepted accounting
practice in the UK.
For example, FRS 3, the new standard on the profit and loss account, does
not allow any provision to be made for the expected loss on sale of a
business until a binding sale agreement has been concluded. The argument is
that there is no liability until that point. But prudence would suggest that
the loss should be provided for as soon as it can be foreseen, even if the
contract has not yet been signed.
In my view, the allocation of transactions to the profit and loss accounts
of successive accounting periods should determine what goes in the balance
sheet, and not the other way round.
Some people may see this as an irrelevant distinction, arguing that the
choice of route makes no difference, because you come back to the same
answer. But the balance sheet under the matching approach which I prefer
will include deferred items which do not meet the ASB's definitions of
assets and liabilities, and should be seen more as a statement of residuals
than as a statement of wealth.
The practical difference between the two approaches emerges in some of the
more complex areas of financial reporting, such as accounting for deferred
tax, foreign currency hedges or pension costs.
For example, under the matching approach which forms the basis of present
accounting practice, the cost of any past service pension enhancements is
deferred and amortised over the future working lives of the employees who
benefit from the enhanced award. In contrast, under the balance sheet
approach the increased cost would have to be written off immediately,
because it would not meet the ASB's definition of an asset.
Does it matter if the balance sheet includes such deferred items? Should it
not be confined to 'real' assets, as the ASB proposes? It might matter if it
were ever possible for a balance sheet to show the wealth of a company in
the first place. But except for investment trusts and similar companies,
this is an unattainable goal.
At best, accounts can be expected to present only a rather stylised model of
a company's financial affairs. We should never forget that financial
reporting is not an end in itself, but simply a means of presenting
information which allows its readers to gain an understanding of the
commercial reality which lies behind it.
The most tangible expression of this reality is to be found in the cash
flows which the company generates and the transactions which give rise to
them. It is these transactions which users of financial information really
need to understand, and which should provide the starting point for the
preparation of the accounts.
Trying to start with the balance sheet is like building a house from the
roof downwards.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Universities warned on snub to public schools

MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday threatened to close down
university teacher training departments which refused to co-operate with
independent schools.
This follows last week's announcement that the government will create a new
agency to control teacher training. Oxford University's education department
does not work with independent schools and a Headmasters' Conference
official described relations with the department as 'appalling'.
Mr Arthur Hearnden, Independent Schools Joint Council general secretary,
said it was well-known that Oxford University's education department shunned
partnerships with independent schools.
Oxford said no local independent schools had applied to it.
Speaking at the Headmasters' Conference annual meeting in Oxford, Mr Patten
said: 'Complaints have come about two or three universities which have
refused to have anything to do with what they call public schools.' He said
he would not hesitate to withdraw government recognition from courses 'where
institutions refused to co-operate with independent schools seeking to set
up teacher training partnerships with state schools.'
Mr Pattern also announced that from next year, independent schools could
apply for government funds to offer teacher training of their own.
He said state schools operating a pilot teacher training scheme this year
received Pounds 4,000 for each of the 2,250 trainees involved.
Mr Patten also voiced his support for the tough public sector pay policy of
the Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke.
The National Union of Teachers called for a pay rise of 8 per cent, plus
Pounds 1,000 per teacher, saying it was necessary to maintain recruitment.
Mr Patten said that such a pay increase would mean the loss of 80,000 jobs.
The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education has
called off a strike planned for 21 September over new contracts of
employment, pending negotiations with the Colleges' Employers' Forum. Natfhe
said it would continue to take local action against colleges which introduce
new contracts that worsen lecturers' conditions.
Students in higher education accumulate average debts of Pounds 614 for each
year of studies, according to a survey in the new edition of Push, a guide
to universities produced in association with Lloyds Bank.
