FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Austrian banks see strong rise
in earnings

Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, and Erste Oesterreichische
Spar-Casse, one of Austria's leading savings banks, forecast strong rises in
earnings for this year.
Both banks plan to strengthen their provisions against bad debts, and while
higher earnings are expected next year, they cautioned against excessive
optimism.
Bank Austria expects operating profits to rise by about 50 per cent for the
whole of 1993 to around Sch5bn (Dollars 416.6m), in spite of difficult
conditions caused by the international recession this year, the bank said.
But Mr Alfons Haiden, chairman, warned the bank was still facing difficult
times ahead and needed to improve earnings further.
Bank Austria was created in November 1991 from a merger of the city of
Vienna's Zentralsparkasse savings bank and Landerbank. It has faced
considerable difficulties in rationalising the activities of its two
constituent institutions, and is having to make large provisions to cover
the costs of the old Zentralsparkasse's pensions obligations.
Pensions provisions are expected to be Sch1.3bn this year, and provisions
against bad debts are expected to be Sch4.3bn.
The number of branches will be reduced by 12 and its workforce cut by 350 by
the end of the year. The bank plans to shed another 400 employees next year.
The Erste forecast a rise in partial operating profits from Sch652m in 1992
to close to Sch1.2bn this year. The bank intends to raise its dividend from
13 per cent last year to 15 per cent. Bad debt provisions would be about
Sch1bn.
'There is no ground for jubilation but (we are) satisfied,' said Mr Konrad
Fuchs, general director. The bank's performance should improve further next
year, though profits would grow more slowly, he said. The bank plans a
capital increase of Sch100m-Sch150m next year.

The Dutch government yesterday named a troika comprised of brokerage houses
Morgan Stanley International, SG Warburg and Credit Suisse First Boston to
lead the first tranche of the privatisation of the Dutch postal and
telecommunications monopoly abroad, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
The Dutch transport and finance ministries said the latest step has
completed the basic structure needed for the flotation of the state-owned
telecom company, Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN).
The flotation of the first tranche, likely to be 25-30 per cent of the total
share capital, is expected in the first half of next year and is by some
analysts estimated to gross around Fl 4bn (Dollars 2bn) to Fl 5bn.
Morgan Stanley has been appointed as regional lead manager for the flotation
in the US, while SG Warburg will act as lead manager in the UK, the
government said. CSFB will manage the flotation in the rest of the world,
the government added.
The names of other banks to be appointed to the syndicate that will finally
carry out the flotation will be announced in March.
At a later, as yet unspecified date, the government will also make known the
number of shares available and terms under which US investors can
participate in the offering.
The announcement follows the appointment of a trio of Dutch banks in
October, led by ABN-Amro, as global co-ordinator and chief manager.

Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, said yesterday it had
reached an agreement to buy Compania Quimica, an Argentine manufacturer of
liquid dish-washing detergents, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed by Procter or Bunge y Born SA,
Quimica's Buenos Aires-based parent company. Procter said the acquisition of
Quimica, which sells a variety of consumer products in Argentina, including
the country's top two dishwashing detergents, was part of a strategy to
expand into Latin America through the purchase of established brands.
The US group began operations in Argentina in 1991, and currently sells a
range of locally-produced and imported consumer goods.

Genentech, the US bio-technology company, expects Pulmozyme, which the Food
and Drug Administration earlier yesterday approved as a treatment for cystic
fibrosis, to make a material contribution to the company's full-year 1994
earnings, Reuter reports from Los Angeles.
'I don't think it will be particularly material in the first quarter, but in
the 1994 full year it will be,' said Mr Kirk Raab, chairman.
Genentech, which is 60 per cent owned by Roche of Switzerland, said it
expected to begin shipping the drug to distributors in the US in
mid-January. Genentech said it had not yet determined pricing.
About 30,000 Americans suffer from cystic fibrosis. Mr Raab said he expected
Pulmozyme, an inhalant which is taken daily by patients, to have deep
penetration among most cystic fibrosis sufferers.
Pulmozyme is not indicated for children under five, because no clinical
trials have yet been conducted on that group.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Kinkel urges stronger ties with the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, yesterday said greater security
and economic links between the European Union and the Nato alliance must be
extended to the countries of eastern Europe and Russia.
In an end-of-year foreign policy statement, Mr Kinkel said the EU, and
Germany in particular, must strengthen the region's security, economic and
democratic structures through more intensive relations.
'It should be our goal to build up our relations with our eastern neighbours
as intensively and confidently as we have done over the past decades,' he
said.
However, Mr Willy Claes, his Belgian counterpart, said a more hurried
approach to Nato membership for eastern European countries would cause
serious trouble for Russian reformers, adding that Nato membership for
countries such as Poland and Hungary was 'not for tomorrow'.
The ministers' views reflect a fundamental debate within the EU and Nato on
how best to consolidate reforms in both central Europe and Russia, which is
likely to figure high on Nato's agenda when it meets on January 10.
Mr Kinkel's statement also reflects concern, particularly in the
Chancellery, that if the EU does not adhere to the timetable in admitting
the Nordic countries and Austria, then prospects of opening up full
membership to the countries of eastern Europe will fade and disillusionment
among the young democracies will set in.
'If the expansion (of the EU to include the Nordic countries and Austria)
runs into difficulties, it would be a hard blow to the prospects of
membership for other states for which we have held out hope.'
Mr Kinkel said Bonn would do its utmost as holder of the EC presidency in
the second half of 1994 to make sure that planned enlargement suffered no
setbacks. 'We Germans have a special responsibility here because of our
past, but also because of our size, our economic power and our central
position in Europe.'
'In the coming year we want to conclude the negotiations for European Union
membership for Finland, Norway, Austria and Sweden,' Mr Kinkel added.
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other former Soviet bloc states are
seeking to join the European Union.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Danes happiest people in EU
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark has the happiest old people in the European Union, according to the
Eurobarometer survey, Reuter reports from Brussels. More than two thirds of
them are satisfied with life, while only 6 per cent of old people in Greece
and 3 per cent in Portugal are satisfied with their lot.
On the other hand, while only 3 per cent of older Danes are dissatisfied, 41
per cent of the Portuguese and 59 per cent of the Greek feel badly done by.
The survey reveals vastly different conditions and chances of happiness
across the Union. 'The variations between countries cannot be painted over
and the challenge the Community faces is to minimise those that derive
mainly from differences in socio-economic conditions,' the survey said. It
singled out level of pensions and segregation from society as sources of
dissatisfaction.
However, the survey showed support for the older generation among young
people. 'They say loud and clear. . . . that older people are a special case
as a deserving cause for action by national governments and the Community as
a whole. . . . It would be a mistake to see this as a display of pity for
old people,' it said.
There was widespread awareness of age discrimination in all member states
and a feeling that something should be done to prevent it. But there was
also a feeling that older people should stand up for themselves more.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Denmark to expand job rotation plan: 'Time-off' programme
aims to shrink country's long dole queues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Danish government is giving a boost to its already ambitious job
rotation programme, which, according to Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime
minister, will contribute to a change in the country's social values.
The purpose of the programme is to encourage people in work to take time off
in order to allow some of the 12.4 per cent (348,000) unemployed to take
over the vacant jobs.
The scheme began earlier this year when it was used by about 16,000 people.
For 1994 the programme has been modified to make it easier to use and to
attract more participants. Among other things, it enables parents of small
children to take leave of up to a year to stay at home with their young
families.
Labour offices report enormous interest in the programme. The government is
expecting that 20,000-25,000 people, or about 1 per cent of the employed
labour force, will use the scheme next year, but it may have underestimated
the popularity of the scheme by a wide margin.
The Confederation of Danish Trade Unions claims, on the basis of a sample
survey, that as many as 240,000 people - more than 10 per cent of the
employed labour force - would like to use the scheme.
The job-rotation programme gives employees three possibilities for going on
leave.
Parent leave. This is the most popular scheme, on offer to parents with
children under the age of nine. Parents can take six months leave, with an
option of extending the period for another six months, while receiving 80
per cent of the maximum unemployment benefit, or about DKr9,000 (Dollars
1,340) per month.
A condition is that children under the age of three do not use municipal
day-care facilities and children over this age only use them on a half-day
basis. Municipal councils can top up the leave payment by a maximum of
DKr2,900 a month, which is roughly what the councils save from reduced use
of day-care facilities. Job training leave. Employees aged over 25 who have
been in work for three of the past five years can take up to a year's leave
for job-related education, receiving the maximum unemployment benefit, about
DKr11,300 a month. The employer's consent is required.
Sabbaticals. Employees can take up to a year off while receiving 80 per cent
of the maximum unemployment benefit, but a condition is that someone from
the dole queue steps into the vacant job.
Private sector employers, especially owners of small companies, have
misgivings as they say finding replacements will be difficult and costly in
terms of training replacements and reduced productivity.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Rate of job losses slows in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The increase in French unemployment slowed sharply during November,
increasing by 3,200 to 3.29m, the labour ministry announced yesterday. The
unemployment rate at the end of the month was stable at 12 per cent of the
workforce.
A ministry official welcomed the figures and said they showed the effects of
government measures to encourage training schemes and part-time employment.
But he said that the rate of unemployment was likely to increase further.
This view was echoed by private sector economists. 'The rate of increase has
slackened but we are likely to see further rises in unemployment until the
second half of next year,' said Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at Morgan
Guaranty.
The slowing in the rise of unemployment in November partly reflected a
reduced number of job losses in the services sector.
Economists said that it also represented a correction from the sharp
increase in October, when the rate jumped from 11.8 per cent to 12 per cent.
November's unemployment figures are the latest in a series of statistics
which suggest that the economy has endured the worst of its sharp recession.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, argues that the economy is now
stabilising and is due to expand by about 1.4 per cent next year in terms of
gross domestic product.
Improved economic performance will, however, take time to curb the rate of
joblessness, the most serious problem facing the government of Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister.
'There is a lag of a few quarters before growth feeds through into jobs,'
says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers.
The French environment minister, Mr Michel Barnier, yesterday called for an
extraordinary EU meeting to review sea transport rules following the
littering of France's western coast by explosives and pesticides which
washed up on the shore, Reuter reports from Paris.
Some 5,000 explosive detonators, believed to have been spilled by a Cypriot
vessel in September, began washing up on French beaches on December 17.
'The current situation is unbearable and seriously endangers Europe's
environment,' Mr Barnier said in a letter to his Greek counterpart, Mr
Costas Laliotis, who would call such a meeting during his country's
presidency of the EC starting next month.
'The measures which must be taken. . . to avoid such accidents becoming
banal must be the product of international talks as a country cannot take
action on sea transport on its own,' he added.

FT  31 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Goldsmiths active
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldsmiths Group, the multiple jeweller, provided the first hard news on
Christmas and pre-Christmas sales, telling the market that UK sales for
December were 13 per cent up on the same month last year and that sales for
the 10 months to date were around 11 per cent higher.
Goldsmiths also said that profits 'will be in excess of market
expectations.' The company's shares raced up to 100p, but quickly
encountered selling pressure and closed 2 off on balance at 89p.
Food retailers provided one of the market's best performers in Kwik Save
which built on Wednesday's good showing and closed a further 6 up at 624p. J
Sainsbury, however, encountered hefty profit taking and settled 6 off at
449p as did Tesco 5 off at 215p.
Bank shares, which played a major part in the upsurge in the market over the
pre-Christmas period as investors focused on the probability of a sharp
increase in profits and dividend payments as the property market improves,
ran into bouts of profit-taking yesterday. The prospect of another reduction
in UK interest rates in the short term also boosted sentiment.
Much of this was said to have been triggered by the expiry of a significant
over the counter options trade involving large numbers of bank shares.
HSBC proved an exception, however, with the shares marked sharply better and
touching a record 982p at one point before closing a net 12 higher at 958p;
turnover in HSBC reached a hefty 5.4m shares. Standard Chartered, rushed up
in recent weeks amid spurious takeover stories, fell 13 to 1234p.
TSB, due to announce results on January 13, came under fire from selling
from one of the big US investment banks and closed 11 off at 243p. Barclays,
meanwhile, lost 8 to 634p, Lloyds 18 to 666p and NatWest 7 to 621p. Abbey
National fell 5 to 513p on 2.4m traded.
Merchant banks were hit by profit-taking and worries that some market
trading firms could have been badly hit by the wild swings in the equity
market in recent sessions. SG Warburg, one of the most influential
marketmakers dropped 10 to 934p. Smith New Court eased 4 to 421p and Hambros
gave up 10 to 392p.
Shares in CE Heath, the insurance broker, slumped 11 to 403p as the company
responded to recent intense takeover speculation by confirming it had been
involved in takeover talks with Inchcape during the summer but that the
discussions were suspended in September. Inchcape were hit by the news,
closing 17 off at 562p.
Press suggestions and recent building society indications that the housing
market is poised for a significant upturn triggered a flurry of strong
support for the housebuilders. Among the sector leaders Berkeley rose 5 more
to 533p, and Wimpey 3 to 189p.
But Wilson (Connolly) took pride of place in the sector, the shares
steepling higher to close 13 up at a record 230p, still boosted by the
recent Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation. Wilson Bowden 13 put on 10 to
509p and Alfred McAlpine 8 to 249p.
CRH, the Irish building materials group was the outstanding performer in the
sector, the shares closing 6 ahead at a year's best of 354p, after keen
support from UK and Irish institutions.
The big UK stocks, on the other hand, were affected by persistent bouts of
selling pressure. RMC dropped 26 to 937p and Redland 10 to 584p.
SmithKline Beecham failed to benefit from the announcement that it had
received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market Kytril,
an injection to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with certain cancer
therapy. The approval which covers use of the product in cancer patients of
all ages, including children and the elderly but had been widely
anticipated. The shares rose slightly after the news but fell with the
market to close 5 off at 402p.
Recently depressed Micro Focus, the computer software group, staged a strong
rally after the Prudential insurance group increased its holding in the
company by 1.13 per cent to 7.62 per cent. Micro Focus closed a net 28
higher at 1003p.
They reached a peak Pounds 30 in mid-February, but plummeted to 903p at the
beginning of December after the group issued a profits warning.
Greycoat, the property group, saw its shares edge up a penny to 19p after
the rump of the rights issue, was placed at 18p by SG Warburg Securities.
Eurotunnel reaped the benefit of Wednesday's late announcement that the
French and UK governments were extending the franchise period in exchange
for dropping legal actions, The units gained 34 to 597p.
Leisure group Granada lost 15 pence to 519 as the group extended its hostile
Pounds 660m offer for LWT (Holdings) by two weeks. LWT which continued to
advise shareholders to reject the bid, fell 20 to 605p. The market expects
Granada to improve its terms with more attractive shares and cash options.
Euro Disney, roughly handled earlier in the week after comments by Walt
Disney chairman Michael Eisner, rallied 20 to 378p. Talk of bumper holiday
bookings drove Airtours, the UK's leading holidays group, 2 better to 492p.
Rank Organisation dipped 10 to 978p.

FT  31 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI and Zeneca firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's headline demerger ended 1993 on a positive note with ICI rising
against the market to close 11 up at 802p and Zeneca lifting 8 to 842p.
US buyers had pushed ICI higher in New York on Wednesday night after they
bought the shares in the form of American Depositary Receipts - ICI ADRs in
New York were up Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 47 1/2 before Wall Street opened
yesterday. The rise squeezed the London stock higher.
Analysts said the shares also benefited from the deal announced by Shell and
Montedison for a merger of their polyolefins interests deal due to 'hopes
for further consolidation in the chemicals industry'.
However dealers attributed much of the strength in the two stocks two heavy
buying from Swiss Bank Corporation which was involved in the expiry of a
very large tailor made option, said to cover 30 leading stocks. One senior
marketmaker said 'Swiss Bank had the ball and they wouldn't let anyone else
play with it.'
High street retailers were broadly lower as institutions moved in to lock in
some of the big profits in the sector.

FT  31 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Index futures trigger selling
pressure in equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices were hit hard in London yesterday in what was clearly a turning
point for the stock market, at least in the short term. Pre-market trade saw
the FT-SE Index 18.8 up at a new intra day peak of 3,480.8, but sellers
immediately appeared, alerted by developments in the derivatives markets.
The UK stock market paid no heed to the continued firmness in continental
European bourses.
Trading volume jumped sharply as dealers decided not to wait for today's
half session, which is the last day of a three week equity account as well
as the final share trading day of 1993. Dealing books were cut yesterday in
preparation for a fresh start on January 4, when the market re-opens after
the new year holiday.
Downward pressure increased as the day proceeded, and with Wall Street weak
at the opening of the new session, London ended at the day's low. The final
reading showed the FT-SE Index down 33.2 at 3,428.
Although a bout of profit-taking had been expected, dealers admitted to
being taken by surprise by the force of selling yesterday. The market's
initial gain reflected strength overnight in other global markets, with Hong
Kong providing the lead. UK traders hoped that profit-takers might hold
their hands until the new year.
The rug was pulled from under equities by weakness in stock index futures as
it appeared that the powerful technical position which has been driving the
futures ahead had been unwound. Suggestions that another, similar, futures
position might surface, kept equities subdued throughout the session.
The fall in shares spread across the range of the market, taking the FT-Mid
250 Index down 20.4 to 3,786.6. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 63 per
cent of the day's Seaq total of 554.1m shares, up from 479.3m in the
previous session.
A sell programme from a leading Swiss securities house completed the tale of
woe and, with most traders already writing off today's curtailed session,
the final picture was gloomy.
Bank stocks, which have dominated the advance in the stock market over the
past month gave ground - the exception being HSBC which was responding to
the influence of its home stock market. Store and retail shares were easier
as the market remained uncertain of the outcome of the Christmas selling
season on which reports continue to vary.
The international blue chips, many of which were involved in the unravelling
of positions in futures, moved more narrowly than the rest of the market.
Pharmaceuticals were mixed, with Zeneca the best feature.
Market analysts refused to be depressed by the setback which has dashed the
hopes of some super-optimists who had been looking for a Footsie close in
the 3,500 area on New Year's Eve.
One characterised yesterday's performance as 'the partial unwinding of a
technical squeeze,' and doubted if UK equities would fall far while they
continued to offer significant attractions by comparison with the
alternatives, including cash.
But traders were more wary, foreseeing a 'choppy market' ahead, especially
if any more futures pressures appear. However, marketmakers welcomed the
chance to take stock on to their trading books which have been feeling the
pressure during the market's powerful pre-Christmas advance.

Derivatives markets played a significant role in undermining share prices
yesterday as a large investment institution finally unwound a large OTC, or
over the counter trade, writes Terry Byland. The complex deal involved 30
stocks and was arranged by the institution some weeks ago when it bought
both put and call options, on the view that the market would remain within a
narrow range until the year-end.
This investment fund, caught out by the December upsurge in the Footsie, had
covered itself by buying heavily into the Footsie March contract. OTC deals
are one-off trades arranged between the securities firm and a client and
yesterday saw the final unwinding of some Pounds 4bn of such deals.
The March future traded actively, recording 13,257 contracts and falling
from an opening of 3,500 to 3,437 before a final quotation of 3,447.
At the close, the premium stood around its fair value premium of 18 points,
but had dipped to 10 points against cash earlier.
Business in traded options, at 28,096, compared with 33,456 on Wednesday.
The FT-SE contract, however, remained active, 15,307 deals against 15,073.
Among individual contracts, the Euro FT-SE was busy, recording 1,357
contracts. HSBC topped the list of individual company options as the shares
responded to the strength in Hong Kong. In Shell, (873) a trader bought back
January calls and sold April calls. Focus on retail prospects saw Marks &amp;
Spencer busy (806) and Royal Insurance, BP and National Power appeared to
feature in the OTC deals.

FT  31 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Nervous bond market tilts Dow
into decline
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices retreated yester day as a skittish bond market undercut the
eagerness of investors to lift the bell wether blue-chip index over the
3,800 mark before the new year, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 18.45 lower at 3,775.88,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp;Poor's 500 was down 1.94 at 468.64.
Secondary indices showed slight gains, with the American SE compos ite was
0.39 ahead at 472.55, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.60 to 771.08.
Volume on the NYSE was light, with 193m shares traded. Declining issues led
advances, 1,080 to 958.
After two days of razor-thin gains, stocks opened weaker as the US Treasury
market reacted nervously to a strong report on November housing activity.
The Commerce Department said that sales of new single-family homes last
month had surged to their highest annual rate in more than seven years.
In a further sign of the econ omy's strength, weekly claims for unemployment
benefit fell sharply confounding expectations of no change. In late trading,
the inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond was down 1 9/32 to 98 3/4 ,
with the yield rising to 6.339 per cent in thin holiday trading. The
negative implications of the data were somewhat miti gated by the December
index of industrial activity released by the Purchasing Manage ment
Association of Chicago. The report showed continued economic strength in the
area, but the rate of acceleration eased from November's espe cially fast
pace.
It was no consolation for bonds, however, and the losses at the long end
grew more pro nounced as the day progressed.
Stocks followed suit. Among the blue chips, IBM lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 57
1/8 , AT&amp;T Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 1/2 , and Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 53 3/8 .
Among the bright spots, LTV climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 16 1/8 and
USF&amp;G, the insurance holding company, advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15
1/8 .
The Nasdaq held up better than the other mar kets. It was aided by a solid
gain by MCI Communications, which added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 on news
that it was planning to spend Dollars 1bn to build local net works in direct
competition with the so-called Baby Bell regional telecoms.
Canada
Toronto stocks rose in light trading, hitting a record high for the second
consecutive day.
The TSE-300 composite index increased 19.96 points, or 0.46 per cent, to
close at 4,329.88. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 429 to 281.
Shell Canada agreed to sell its polypropylene business to a new entity
formed by the merger of most of the petrochemicals businesses of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group and Montedison. Shell Canada gained 5/8 to 38 1/2.

FT  31 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses aim for strong
end to 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bourses seemed determined to see a strong conclusion to 1993, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT ended 1993 with a new high, the DAX index jumping 51.98, or 2.3
per cent to 2,266.68 for a gain on the year of 47.6 per cent.
Turnover soared from DM7.9bn to DM11.2bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf said that the late rally, like most of the business over the
holiday period, reflected futures and OTC-related buying.
The big winners of 1993 tended to be cyclicals, or story-related.
Mannesmann, with its cellular telephone network prospects, led the DAX
constituents with a 1993 gain of 85.5 per cent, and other story-led stocks
in the top 10 included Volkswagen - up 81.7 per cent on restructuring
prospects, in spite of a temporary fall from grace - Lufthansa, with
enhanced prospects in international airways, and Schering on its BetaSeron
multiple sclerosis drug potential.
The clear loser was Metallgesellschaft, down 17.8 per cent after a further
DM2.50 fall to DM273 yesterday on reports that the company is planning to
raise its capital and that foreign creditor banks are preparing to recall
loans.
PARIS ended close to, but just below Wednesday's 1993 high, the CAC-40 index
finishing 0.67 lower at 2,281.22. Turnover stayed surprisingly strong at
FFr4.85m.
Eurotunnel rose FFr2.15, or 4.5 per cent to FFr51.60 after Wednesday's late
news of a 10-year extension to its concession to operate the Channel tunnel.
Euro Disney recovered another FFr1.10, or 3.4 per cent to FFr33 on short
covering.
MADRID regained a slice of the ground it lost after the Bank of Spain's
decision to intervene in Banesto and replace its board of directors, the
general index rising 4.63 to 319.19 as turnover stayed high at Pta38.5bn.
BCH was the best performer in a resurgent banking sector, rising Pta295, or
9.5 per cent to Pta3,400. However, BBV was relatively subdued, rising only
Pta40 to Pta 3,115 although the bank said, in contradiction of analysts and
of press reports, that it was not planning to take over Banesto.
MILAN was stirred to life after a subdued start by confirmation of the long
awaited accord between Montedison and Shell on merging part of their
chemicals businesses. However, a 0.34 dip in the Comit index to 613.49 was
attributed to continuing reaction to news late on Wednesday that the
government was planning to re-introduce a revised system of capital gains
tax.
Montedison rose L34 or 3.9 per cent to L912.90 in heavy volume of 22.8m
shares on expectations that the agreement would enable the troubled Italian
group to wipe out some L3,000bn of debt.
Olivetti put on L54 or 2.6 per cent to L2,133 following newspaper reports
that talks with a German investor group over the sale of its Triumph-Adler
subsidiary in Nuremberg were at an advanced stage.
The Italian group was also helped by a L63 or 5.0 per cent rise to L1,331 in
the Cofide holding company amid rumours of a reorganisation and possible
asset sales.
AMSTERDAM was broadly higher on a strong dollar and firmer Dutch bonds. The
CBS Tendency index finished 0.90 higher at 149.20.
Philips stayed active, adding 30 cents to Fl 40.00. ABN-Amro, weak in recent
days, put on Fl 1.20 to Fl 71.50.
ING added Fl 1.30 to Fl 92.90 after it acquired 49.9 per cent of the shares
in the construction group, Ballast Nedam from British Aerospace.
Akzo, the chemical group, gained Fl 2.00 at Fl 188.00 after it outlined
benefits from the takeover of Sweden's Nobel.
ZURICH bounced higher after a two-session consolidation,the SMI index adding
23.4 to 2,957.6 on the last trading day of the year.
Interest centred on industrials which profit from the firmer dollar and
hopes of an economic recovery in 1994. Ciba registered, the most actively
traded, ended SFr15 firmer at SFr900.
The troubled telecoms group, Ascom, added SFr85 or 6.3 per cent to SFr1,425
while Oerlikon Buhrle, the arms to fashion combine, rose SFr9 or 6.9 per
cent to SFr140: both shares were tipped in some quarters as an alternative
to blue chips in 1994.
DUBLIN, closed on Wednesday when London surged, added 1.9 per cent as the
market sought to catch up. The Iseq index rose 35.69 to 1,883.44 with firm
demand evident, but few investors willing to sell holdings.

After the modest gains posted on Wednesday, Japanese share prices advanced
further on small-lot buys from investment trust managers to end the final
half-day session of 1993 in positive territory, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues gained 145.21 to settled at
17,417.24, its intraday peak, and 2.9 per cent higher over the year, after
opening at the day's low of 17,309.23. The session's close represents the
first time for three years that the key barometer has settled above the
year-earlier level. The Topix index of all first section issues rose 10.04
to 1,439.31, while in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.27 to 1,188.45.
With most stock market investors away for the winter holiday, trading volume
languished at an estimated 120m shares, compared with Wednesday's final
215m. Advances led declines by 616 to 278, with 200 issues unchanged.
Japanese brokers say that investors are relieved, judging that 1993 was the
fourth straight year of a bear market and that it is now behind them. An
immediate recovery for equity prices, they add, is unlikely, but hopes exist
for a gradual rise in the Nikkei average in the first quarter of 1994, and
for slight improvements in the overall domestic economy before the summer.
Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will still have a
difficult time convincing stock market participants that 1994 will be a
period of major gains during his traditional pep talk on the first day of
trading.
All available evidence suggests that there is no compelling reason for
institutional and private investors to enter the market aggressively. The
outlook for corporate earnings remains bleak, the domestic economy has
dipped deeper into a slump, as revealed by the recent 2.8 per cent rise in
unemployment, the worse figure in six years. And the Japanese government's
steps to rescue the market may prove unsuccessful.
The day's rise, however, did give a boost to some banking issues. Sumitomo
Bank rose Y50 to Y1,950, Fuji Bank advanced Y40 to Y1,980 and the Industrial
Bank of Japan climbed Y30 to Y2,830. Issues in the securities sector also
settled higher. Nikko Securities rebounded Y20 to Y1,090, and Yamaichi
Securities edged Y3 higher to Y595.
Gains in gold prices, internationally, encouraged buying in non-ferrous
issues. Sumitomo Metal Mining jumped Y24 to Y870, and Mitsui Mining and
Smelting moved Y17 higher to Y398.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 136.25 higher to 19,221.72, in volume of
16.8m.
Roundup
The Pacific Rim remained in good heart, with further records set in Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Australia, Karachi, Bangkok and Jakarta.
TAIWAN surged 5 per cent to a 30-month high on news that the economics
minister, Chiang Pin-kung, had said the island should seek direct shipping
links with China next year. The weighted index jumped 275.48 to 5,813.55,
its highest finish since 5,900.70 on June 28, 1991. Turnover was a hectic
TDollars 100.5bn against TDollars 83.0bn on Wednesday.
HONG KONG overcame Wednesday's consolidation, surging 3.7 per cent to a
fresh record on a new wave of Japanese and US buying. The Hang Seng index
added 427.70 to 11,877.47, having peaked just short of the 12,000 level at
an all-time intra-day high of 11,959.06.
China's announcement that it would unify its exchange rates was also viewed
as a long-term positive factor but it had little short-term effect.
Turnover was a preliminary HKDollars 10.87bn against a final HKDollars
9.51bn on Wednesday.
AUSTRALIA rose 1.3 per cent to a six-year high amid strong local and foreign
demand in a market short of sellers. The All Ordinaries index closed 27.6
higher at 2,154.5, easily exceeding its previous post-1987 stock markets
crash peak of 2,132.4 reached on November 1.
KARACHI closed the year at a record high in a year-end buying spree which
took the KSE 100-share index 20.50 higher to 2,164.26.
BANGKOK was higher but off a morning peak as investors sold finance and
brokerage shares to cash in profits before the long new year holidays. The
SET index rose 14.22 to a record 1,682.85 after touching a high of 1,695.18
in early trade.
NEW ZEALAND advanced 1.2 per cent in thin trade and the NZSE-40 index added
25.11 to 2,180.23, just 23 points short of its high for the year.
SINGAPORE saw aggressive selling after three days on the upgrade and the
Straits Times Industrials index dipped 36.24 points or 1.5 per cent from
Wednesday's closing high, to 2,390.61.
JAKARTA closed mixed, but still saw a final high although local investors
took profits on the last trading day of 1993. The official index rose 0.88
to 588.77.
KUALA LUMPUR underwent an early technical correction in response to recent
sharp gains before bargain-hunting lifted the composite index from a day's
low of 1,216.59 to finish 0.13 easier at 1,231.73. Gaming stocks were marked
down in response to the imposition of higher gaming tax and betting and
sweepstake duty from January 15.

FT  31 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Oil majors defy five-year low in crude
 -But the possibility exists that the perception will soon change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors may be forgiven for wondering why shares in some of the world's
biggest oil companies have managed to ride the current wave of euphoria
sweeping international stock markets, at the same time as crude oil prices
plummet to new five-year lows.
'There is a feeling that the sector, so far, has defied the effects of
declining oil prices,' according to Mr Fergus McLeod, oil industry analyst
at brokers NatWest Securities in Edinburgh. But that perception may soon
change, especially if oil prices, which have fallen by almost 30 per cent
this year as measured by the benchmark Brent Blend, become even more
volatile. In that situation, says Mr McLeod, 'share prices begin to track
changes in the daily oil prices.'
The absolute performance of international oil shares has varied widely this
year. In the US, for example, only a few of the big integrated oil
companies, most notably Chevron and Mobil, managed to outperform the S &amp; P
Composite Index. But recent figures from Goldman Sachs, the US investment
bank, show that the majors still managed to record respectable gains. Exxon
shares were up 3.3 per cent from the begining of the year to December 21,
compared with a 6.8 per cent rise in the S &amp; P Composite. Texaco fared
somewhat better, turning in a 6.3 per cent rise.
The ADRs of a number of foreign oil companies easily outperformed the S &amp; P.
British Petroleum, a quarter of whose shares are held by American investors,
saw the value of its ADRs rise by 38 per cent, compared with a 43.3 per cent
increase in its home market in London.
The ADRs of Royal Dutch Shell, a traditional haven for investors at a time
of uncertainty in the oil markets, were up by 27.8 per cent. The Anglo-Dutch
group looked less exciting in its domestic markets. In the Netherlands Royal
Dutch shares rose by 34.3 per cent, compared with a 38.9 per cent rise in
the ANP-CBS Index. In the UK, shares in Shell Transport and Trading
outperformed the FT All Share Index, by recording a 26 per cent increase,
compared with the 20.6 per cent rise of the index to December 21.
Elsewhere in Europe oil company shares have generally fared well. In France,
Total shares were up 34.6 per cent, compared with a 25.4 per cent rise in
Paris equities in general. Shares in Elf Aquitaine were some way behind the
average, managing only a 14 per cent increase.
In Spain, shares in Repsol, another favourite of international investors,
were up 58.4 per cent, against a 47.8 per cent rise in the Madrid index.
Themes which have helped to push the share prices of the integrated majors
higher at a time of declining oil prices include:
successful corporate cost cutting, a particular strong point for BP;
higher refining and marketing margins as crude prices decline; and
buoyant natural gas prices, especially in the US.
But the impact of these factors is likely to wane in coming months if oil
prices remain weak. Estimates by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank,
suggest that 12 of the biggest US-based integrated companies could earn only
Dollars 1.87bn from exploration and production activities in the current
quarter, compared with Dollars 3.2bn in the same period last year.
Mr McLeod believes that the cost-cutting theme will take on even more
importance if weak crude prices cut deeply into cash flow next year. 'It
will be difficult for them to match this year's performance, but it will be
one of the few things they can do to enhance profitability,' he says.
Companies will also be delaying or cancelling capital spending, although
most are already committed to 1994 programmes.
Mr Paul Spedding, an analyst at brokers Kleinwort Benson in London, agrees
that investors will focus on companies which 'can get growth' from sources
other than the oil price itself, whether these be cost-cutting, or an
emphasis on higher value products such as lubricants.
But, most of all, investors and company executives alike will be focusing on
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for a sign that oil prices
have bottomed out and are heading back up.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Dollar shows fresh gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New indications about the strength of the US economy pushed the dollar
higher while the French franc also enjoyed a good spell against the D-Mark,
writes Peter Marsh.
A bigger than expected fall in US unemployment and bullish figures on home
sales were behind the rise in the US currency, which just failed to break
through the Y112 'wall' against the yen.
The franc rose to its strongest levels against a lacklustre German currency
since the exchange rate crisis of July, amid hopes of an easing in European
interest rates over the next few months to boost tentative recovery signs
across the continent.
A surprise cut in Dutch interest rates failed to excite dealers in most
trading centres, where currency sales were extremely thin as markets wound
down ahead of the new year holiday.
The main talking point for investors was the continued rise in the dollar on
the back of a decline in the number of Americans claiming unemployment
benefits. The figure fell 39,000 last week to 291,000, the lowest for nearly
five years. Indications that US growth next year will be fairly high were
helped by news of a rise in house and apartment sales.
The data triggered buy orders for the dollar, which rose nearly 2 pfennigs
on the day to DM1.7337 by the close of European trading. That marked a 3 1/2
pfennig rise since Tuesday night and a gain of 7 per cent since the start of
the year. Against the yen, the dollar extended its recent run of strength,
closing at Y111.845, after Y111.8 the previous night. Even though the dollar
has fallen 10.5 per cent against the Japanese currency since January 1, many
expect these losses to be chipped away in the new year as a result of doubts
about the strength of the Japanese economy.
In European trading yesterday, the dollar rose at one stage to Y111.95 but
got no further. Rumour had it that Japanese exporters placed dollar sell
orders at Y112 to limit the dollar's advance.
Against a D-Mark which lacked support, the yen made steady gains, with the
German currency quoted last night at Y64.53, after Y65.08 on Wednesday
evening. This followed on from the yen's strength against the German
currency over the year, during which it has put on nearly 20 per cent.
In early European trading, the French franc moved up to FFr3.395 per D-Mark
from FFr3.40 on Wednesday. This was its highest level since July 8, and
comfortably above the FFr3.404 at which it started the year. There was even
some talk among the more wild-eyed franc enthusiasts in the market of the
currency making its way to FFr3.35 over time as the outlook for the French
economy improved. But news that seasonally adjusted unemployment in France
rose in November to a record 3.285m did little to arouse bullish sentiments,
and the franc closed at FFr3.397 to the D-Mark, barely changed. The Danish
crown also firmed to around DKr3.9 per D-Mark from DKr3.906.
In Amsterdam, the Dutch central bank created something of a stir in the
sleepy market conditions by cutting its special advances money market rate
to 5.6 per cent from 5.7 per cent. The reduction followed the guilder's
recent strength against the D-Mark which has seen it move to 10-year highs.
Nevertheless many traders had not expected any Dutch move on monetary policy
until January 6, when the Bundesbank council is expected to discuss a
lowering in its Lombard and discount interest rates. The guilder traded
yesterday at HFl1.118 per D-Mark, against HFl. 119 the previous day, holding
fairly steady after news of the cut.
Sterling slipped against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4768, down 1 1/2
cents, while against the German currency it was quoted last night at
DM2.5602, slightly lower than the DM2.5624 on Wednesday evening. Over the
year the pound has fallen 2.5 per cent against the dollar though gained 4.3
per cent against the German currency. The overall rise in its trade weighted
index has been nearly 3 per cent. Sterling was little affected by figures
showing British bank notes in circulation rose a high 7.1 per cent in the
week to December 29 over the equivalent week a year ago. Economists gave the
numbers little attention on the grounds that they may have been have been
distorted by the Christmas holiday. However, indications that the UK economy
is continuing to recover were buoyed by news of a sharp fall in company
failures in the fourth quarter. The data were hailed by the Treasury as
showing the upturn was 'well under way'. In its money market operations the
Bank of England channelled Pounds 1.659bn into the banking system after
forecasting a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.75bn.
Norway's central bank said it had bought NKr1.4bn on foreign currency
markets last week to support the currency which has recently looked unsteady
against the D-Mark and other European currencies. It said it purchased
NKr500m on Wednesday and NKr900m on Thursday.
In Frankfurt, German call money tightened, with the bulk of money market
business being transacted at interest rates of between 6.5 per cent and 6.8
per cent. Rates generally straddled the Bundesbank's Lombard rate of 6.75
per cent, as banks strove to ensure they had secured a required monthly
average on minimum reserves of above DM60bn. The monthly average reached
DM60.2bn by the close of business on Tuesday.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Windwards to restructure banana
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The banana industry in the Windward Islands, the main source of Britain's
imports of the fruit, is being restructured by the islands' governments in
what they say is part of an effort to make it commercially competitive and
to improve its chances of retaining its market in Europe, which is
threatened by Latin American competition.
The Windward Islands Banana Association, known as Winban, a statutory
commodity board, is being dissolved early in the new year, and will be
replaced by two new companies, both to be jointly owned by the four
governments and private business.
'At the moment, all our agencies are statutory boards and I do not think
that is good enough,' said Dame Eugenia Charles, the prime minister of
Dominica, one of the Windward Islands. She met with her counterparts from
Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent to discuss the future of the industry, on
which the economies of the four islands depend.
'I think they must be commercial corporations which have to do business on a
business-like basis. We have to look at the fact that this is a business and
if we don't do it in a business-like way we will go to the wall,' Dame
Eugenia said.
The company that will replace Winban will have a subsidiary that will be
responsible for procurement of inputs at lower costs, technical operations
and extension services to improve the quality of fruit exported from the
four islands. Dame Eugenia said that the company would seek higher profits
from contracts negotiated with exporters. Geest has been the exporter of
Windward Islands bananas for the past 40 years.
The Windward Islands banana industry, and that in other Caribbean and some
African countries that are traditional suppliers to Europe, has been under
increasing pressure from more commercially competitive Latin American
producers seeking unfettered access to the European Union.
Latin American countries have challenged a European Union import regime that
took effect in July, which imposes a 2m tonnes-a-year quota for Latin
American fruit. The imports attract duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 78) a tonne,
while the duty on imports above the quota is Ecu850 a tonne. Europe's
traditional suppliers in the Caribbean and Africa have access for the
remainder of the EU's needs of about 1.5m tonnes a year, and will attract no
tariff.
The summit to discuss the Windward Islands industry's future attacked the
EU's recent decision to offer access for an additional 100,000 tonnes of
bananas to Latin producers next year, and another 200,000 tonnes in 1995.
The concession came during the last hours of the negotiations on the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade earlier this month. Caribbean producers fear
that this increased access, if accepted by the Latin producers, will eat
into their market and depress prices.
'What upsets us is that Gatt has taken seven years to come into being but it
didn't take seven minutes to decide that the Windward Islands don't count,'
said Dame Eugenia. She said the current attitude in Europe was that
Caribbean producers 'can be thrown to the wall, let them sink, let them go,
let them go completely bankrupt, we don't care, we're going to help the
Latin countries'.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold and base metals higher but
coffee tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London gold and base metals markets moved towards 1994 in confident mood
yesterday, but coffee futures tumbled.
At the bullion market, follow-through from overnight strength in New York
pushed the gold price to a 5-month high of Dollars 392.50 a troy ounce at
one stage, before it closed at USDollars 390.50, up Dollars 3.80 on the day.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that the market was still on course to
get through resistance at Dollars 392 and to re-establish a price above
Dollars 400 an ounce, although that would have to wait till January.
Christmas cheer was prolonged at the London Metal Exchange, meanwhile, as
traders looked forward to an upturn in global economic activity and
reductions in excess production capacity in the new year.
The three months delivery copper price added Dollars 22.75 to Wednesday's
Dollars 22.25-a-tonne advance before profit-taking trimmed it back to
Dollars 1,828.50 a tonne, up Dollars 6, at the close. But lead held on to
its gains, the three months price closing at a 13 1/2 -month high, just 50
cents short of the Dollars 500-a-tonne mark.
Zinc, tin and nickel price changes were also securely in the plus column and
the only LME contract to end down on the day was aluminium, the three months
price surrendering Dollars 2 of Wednesday's Dollars 17.25 rise at Dollars
1,137.50 a tonne.
The London Commodity Exchange's coffee futures market presented a very
different picture. Taking their cue from the extremely weak overnight tone
in New York, sellers were quickly on to the offensive and by the close the
March futures position was quoted at Dollars 1,189 a tonne, down Dollars 43
on the day.
'This is just mirroring what happened in New York last night,' one trader
told Reuter. 'It was purely a technical move.'
Another suggested that the New York contract's failure to breach the 80
cents-a-pound barrier had 'left the market looking at the technicals. . .
and they were starting to look less positive'. Most agreed, however, that
background fundamentals remained positive.

FT  31 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Christmas and New Year holidays are having their usual effect on the
market. No wool sales are held, and at the same time most firms in the main
wool using countries are closed not only for production but also for trading
purposes, with only skeleton staffs nominally available. Since the market
itself closed before Christmas with prices either barely steady or only
hesitantly firmer, buying incentives are in any case limited. Only with
certain British wool categories was there a definite price rise, and this
was due to a very small number of firms competing to fill special needs. As
for the market, when it does revive after the holiday, wait and see seems to
be the general approach.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambian copper group pulls back
from brink, says Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the country's biggest export earner and
once one of the world's biggest copper producers, has in the past few weeks
pulled back from threatened collapse, caused by a cash-flow crisis, and 1994
could provide ideal conditions for the state-owned group 'to turn positively
to the task of renewal and revival,' according to Credit Lyonnais Laing,
part of the French banking group.
CLL suggests that a weakening copper price and a strong local currency swept
ZCCM's profits away in the second half of the financial year that ends next
March.
'The fall in the copper price in the second half of 1993 exposed the
high-cost nature of the operations on the (African) copper belt and also
exposed the problems of a reactive management which has done too little to
cut long-term costs and which has yet to come to terms with new hardline
government policy on industrial support,' says analyst Mr Michael Coulson in
CLL's latest International Mining Monitor.
He suggests that at present ZCCM is not generating enough cash to service
repayments on its near-USDollars 900m of debt or to maintain output at
present operations, let alone to allow investment in the development of new
mines to secure its future.
'If nothing is done, the best ZCCM could hope for would be a future of
steady decline with the occasional metal price surge enabling the company to
undertake some new project development but on a much smaller scale than
originally envisaged,' says Mr Coulson. This would mean annual output of
200,000 tonnes for 15 to 20 years whereas the present USDollars 2bn, 14-year
plan would continue output at about 450,000 tonnes for 50 years.
He calls for the Zambian government to move forward with privatisation of
ZCCM, something donors of the country's USDollars 7bn debt believe would
strengthen Zambia's economic performance.
Mr Coulson dismisses, however, the idea that ZCCM - which has a present
stock market value of about USDollars 300m - is worth billions. This idea
harks back to the early 1980s when the oil groups were bidding up the price
of mining companies and the Japanese offered USDollars 2bn for Zambia's
copper mines.
He says that, ideally, an additional big mining group should get involved
with ZCCM alongside the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, which
owns 27.3 per cent. Anglo will have a great deal to do in 'courting the new
ANC-dominated (South African) government.' It would be healthy for a big
group such as RTZ Corporation of the UK, Phelps Dodge of the US or BHP of
Australia to enter the picture, perhaps by taking a majority stake in the
USDollars 550m, Konkola Deep mine venture that is vital to ZCCM's long-term
plans.
Mr Coulson concludes: 'We do not think disaster for ZCCM is inevitable. The
reconstruction and refinancing of the company swiftly undertaken can secure
its competitive position in the international copper market and underpin its
long-term future as a substantial and low-cost producer'.
ZCCM is threatening Zambia's budget and economic reform programme by failing
to pay taxes and debts, according to a senior government mining official,
reports Reuter from Lusaka.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Relentless rally lifts US maize
prices to 5-year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US maize prices are ending the year at 5-year highs, maintaining a gentle
but relentless rally that began in early November on news that 1993 crop
disasters had reduced US grain production by as much as 25 per cent from the
previous year's record.
Maize futures for March delivery have rallied 13 per cent since the November
crop production report, topping Dollars 3.04 a bushel yesterday. Despite the
feed price inflation US cattle and pig farmers have not yet begun to trim
their herds, and maize processors who make high fructose corn syrup are
continuing regular production schedules.
Analysts say that maize prices will have to remain over Dollars 3 a bushel
for a sustained period before domestic consumers begin to ration use. Export
demand for US maize is dismal, but domestic use is high. US poultry flocks
and cattle herds are at record levels and the US pig crop is only slightly
smaller than a year ago.
Mr Dan Basse, analyst for the consulting group AgResources, says that he
expects livestock farmers to make more efficient use of grain and to feed
low quality wheat, instead of maize, to reduce feed costs.
Mr Steve Freed, an analyst with ADM Investors services, says maize prices
will continue higher at least until January 12, when the US Department of
Agriculture releases its final estimate of maize, wheat, and soyabean crop
sizes and its assessment of how many bushels of grain the US holds in
stocks.
The ADM analyst expects the USDA to lower its US maize production figure for
1993 to 6.4bn bushels, from November's 6.5bn-bushel estimate, and to put
maize stocks at 5.9bn bushels, far lower than last year's December 1 supply
of 7.9bn.
'Everyone's plugged into the idea that this will be the most bullish crop
report of the year,' Mr Freed says. 'If the (maize) stocks number is much
below 6bn bushels, prices will go higher to ration use. There will be no
margin for error in the '94 crop.' However, he said, if the report showed
more grain in storage than expected, the market was poised for a downward
correction.
Prices for the other dominant feed crop in the US, soyabeans, have lagged
the maize price rally, in part because traders are eyeing South American
soya farms with caution. South America's soyabean crops will be harvested
before the next US maize crop, providing some relief to worldwide tightness
in feed grain supplies. Despite some early problems in Argentina, analysts
said soya crops there and in Brazil are in good condition and could produce
record yields.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc price forecast to shine in
new year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lead is the non-ferrous metal likely to show the biggest average price
increase in 1994 but zinc is expected to be the best-performing of the
materials traded on the London Metal Exchange, according to Ms Rhona
O'Connell, analyst at T. Hoare and Co., the financial services company.
'While lead prices are expected to peak around the end of the first quarter,
zinc looks to be in a bull market which is likely to be sustained through
the year,' she says in a special report, Base Metals, 1994.
Both lead and zinc mines have been cutting output in 1993 and these cuts are
now flowing through into smelter and refinery closures, Ms O'Connell points
out.
She forecasts that lead prices will move up by more than 21 per cent from an
average of 19 US cents a pound in 1993 to 23 cents in 1994. However, the
1994 first-half average of 24 cents will ease back to 22 cents in the second
six months, she predicts.
Meanwhile, an 11.4 per cent price rise is forecast for zinc, taking it from
an average of 44 cents a pound in 1993 to 49 cents. Ms O'Connell suggests
that zinc's 1994 first-half average will be 48 cents, moving up to 50 cents
in the second half.
According to the analyst, nickel will experience the biggest price fall in
1994, one of 7.4 per cent from an average of Dollars 2.43 a pound to Dollars
2.25. Nickel is the only metal for which she expects demand to fall in 1994,
from an estimated 651,000 tonnes in 1993 to 634,000 tonnes.
Copper's average price is predicted to fall by 6.3 per cent, from 88 US
cents a pound to 82.5 cents, while aluminium's, already very depressed, is
forecast to fall from 53 US cents a pound to 51 cents.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Data surprise rouses Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury market was shaken out of its holiday slumber yesterday by
two stronger-than-expected readings on the economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 9/32 to 98
3/4 , with the yield rising to 6.339 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was off  3/32 to 99 31/32 , to yield 4.25 per cent.
Dealers said the downward trend was not indicative of any fundamental shift
in sentiment, as the day's economic news merely reinforced a
well-established view of the economy's fourth-quarter performance. The
extent of the price erosion was more a reflection of the thin level of
trading.
Nevertheless, after two days of shrugging off unfavourable news, the market
reacted sharply to the Commerce Department's news on new-home sales. These
had surged in November to their highest annual level in more than seven
years.
The Labor Department, meanwhile, said claims for unemployment benefit had
fallen sharply last week, confounding expectations of no change.
The index-linked sector provided the main focus of attention in the UK
government bond market yesterday, as the Bank of England announced a further
Pounds 750m of index-linked stock available for sale today.
The four taps are: Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked treasury stock
due 2001; Pounds 250m of 4 3/8 per cent index-linked treasury stock due
2004; Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked treasury stock due 2013;
and Pounds 200m of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked treasury stock due 2030.
The sector was firm early in the day, gaining about  3/8 of a point.
'There's good demand for index-linkers at the moment because of continued
optimism that real rates will fall further,' said one gilt market
specialist.
French government bond futures climbed to new highs, buoyed by a firm franc
and expectations of an easing in interest rates early in the new year.
The March 10-year bond futures contract broke through the 131.00 level to
reach a high of 131.04, but ended the day at 130.94, up 0.12 in quite thin
trade.
The announcement yesterday of poor unemployment figures had little impact on
the market, dealers said. The jobless rate was unchanged at 12 per cent.

FT  31 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: European futures trade comes
of age - Non-US exchanges took the lead in a record year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a record year for futures business, the market share of the US exchanges
relative to the rest of the world dwindled, as it has every year for the
past decade. For the first time, the combined volume of the 47 futures
exchanges outside the US exceeded that of the 15 US exchanges.
The continued shift was apparent despite historically high turnover for the
Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME),
which together traded well over 300m contracts. This preserved their places
as the top derivatives exchanges in the world.
In part, the trend reflects cyclical developments within the industry. Many
European exchanges have been operating for less than 10 years, and are still
at a stage of rapid growth, fuelled by successful new product launches. The
US market, on the other hand, is more mature, and relies on organic growth.
The faster growth of non-US markets was also driven by historically low US
interest rates, which encouraged US fund managers to diversify into overseas
markets. They used futures to hedge their underlying investments - or, in
some cases, took positions using futures, which are more liquid than some
cash markets.
'The domestic user base in the US is getting more mature, and we are
benefitting from the fact that they are looking to manage risk overseas,'
says Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of the London International Financial
Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe). At the same time, the European base
continues to expand, while Asia remains a largely untapped source of
business, he adds.
Industry experts say that to remain competitive with newer rivals, US
exchanges will have to consolidate, cut costs, and co-operate more. Attempts
in this direction failed more often than they succeeded in 1993, but US
markets prospered regardless, on a surge of global interest rate
restructuring.
Institutional participation was most marked at the CME, where overall volume
was up a modest 9 per cent at the end of November, but where open interest,
a gauge of how many positions are held for long-term hedges, ballooned to
5.6m, nearly double that of its closest competitor, Liffe.
The CME's Eurodollar futures, used extensively for hedging interest rate
swaps, saw year-to-date turnover surge to 60m contracts at the end of
November. The CME has been quietly extending delivery periods for the
instruments to accommodate over-the-counter traders, so that it is now
possible to hedge a three-month Eurodollar commitment for delivery 10 years
into the future.
Institutional interest in the CME has driven up membership prices to a
record Dollars 650,000, approaching the value of a New York Stock Exchange
seat, and widening the gap with the Chicago Board of Trade, where a seat
recently traded at Dollars 495,000. Mr Jack Sandner, the CME's chairman, is
effusive about the exchange's growth. 'All this at a time of low (US
interest rate) volatility,' he says. 'If interest rates start to rise, the
roof is going to blow off this place.'
An 18 per cent volume gain this year by the Chicago Board of Trade came on
the heels of a redistribution of US Treasury debt and flood-related crop
disasters. The CBoT had a once-in-a-decade boom in both financial and
agricultural products, with the most explosive growth occuring in its five-
and 10-year Treasury note contracts and its soya bean futures. However, the
CBoT's remarkable double-digit growth was nearly overshadowed by internal
management squabbles, renewed rivalry with the CME, and quarrels with
Reuters over the future of Globex, the electronic futures trading system.
While the CME opened a new trading floor this year to accommodate growth,
the CBoT is still struggling to replace its antiquated financial futures
trading room, a symptom, some traders say, of the exchange's inability to
plan for the future.
The New York Mercantile Exchange, the booming energy market, was the only
other US exchange to rank in the top 10 busiest futures exchanges in 1993.
Its bid to acquire the New York Commodity Exchange is still pending. If the
bid is successful, the exchanges' combined volumes - nearly 70m contracts -
could vault the Nymex back into fourth place. The strong performance by
European exchanges - with Spain's Meff and Italy's Mif also posting
impressive growth - reflected a period of unusual volatility, as currencies
within the European exchange rate mechanism came under repeated pressure.
The partial collapse of the system has encouraged more active hedging, in
both the over-the-counter and exchange-traded markets, with OTC trades
frequently offset by futures transactions.
The exception to the rule was Switzerland's Soffex, which traded 6.1m
contracts, compared with 8.6m for the same period last year.
Liffe's impressive performance, widening the gap with France's Matif, was
based on its ability to offer a broad range of European products. The
exchange managed to stave off competition from Germany's Deutsche
Terminborse (DTB) and Italy's Mif on its German and Italian interest rate
products, maintaining a market share of over 70 per cent in the key Bund
contract and increasing its share of Italian bond (BTP) futures trading from
60 per cent to 75 per cent. (Liffe traded 5.7m BTP contracts in the year to
November, up a massive 60 per cent on the previous year.)
However, there are potential problems on the horizon. Both Liffe's new
products launched this year - the Spanish bond and German medium-term bond
(Bobl) contracts - flopped. And the planned link-up between France's Matif
and the DTB also poses a threat to Liffe's dominance. While both the DTB and
the Matif say they do not plan to merge, the creation of a shared network
for trading French and German products - probably the most important
European markets - would be likely to attract at least some business away
from Liffe. If the exchanges were to merge, their combined volume is already
larger than Liffe's.
This may increase pressure on Liffe to join Globex, the troubled electronic
futures trading system developed by Reuters, the CME and the CBoT. So far,
volume on the system has been disappointing, and disputes over the running
of Globex have discouraged other exchanges (apart from the Matif, which
signed up at an early stage of development) from joining. However, the
agreement between the three backers of the system is due to be renegotiated
in April. Changes to the management of the system - currently run by the two
Chicago exchanges - are widely expected, possibly making way for new
entrants.
While continued growth in futures trading is predicted, it may be difficult
for European exchanges, as well as US exchanges, to maintain annual growth
of between 30 and 40 per cent. Most liquid bond and stock markets have
already spawned successful futures contracts, prompting exchanges to look at
more esoteric areas, such as insurance, which are unlikely to generate such
heavy volume.
Instead, industry specialists predict greater co-operation in marketing to
new users. The potential user base of European fund managers has yet to be
fully tapped, and traders report growing interest from Asia.

FT  31 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Two local authorities plan to
tap sterling sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two UK local authorities are planning to tap the sterling bond market in
January, marking the first appearance by such borrowers in the domestic bond
market in over a decade.
The local authorities of Leicester and Salford hope to raise between Pounds
80m and Pounds 100m each from UK institutional and wealthy retail investors
next month, provided market conditions are suitable.
Both local authorities are expected to issue 25-year bonds, tapping the long
end of the sterling bond market and taking advantage of low interest rates.
UBS has won the mandate for both issues, which will be set up with a trustee
arrangement to look after the interests of investors.
The issues would be partly-paid. Although pricing the deals may prove
difficult, given the absence of similar issues to set a market standard,
they are expected to have identical terms and conditions. Neither Leicester
nor Salford has a credit rating.
Until recently, there were uncertainties about the ability of the local
authorities to issue bonds. However, the Department of the Environment and
the Treasury clarified the situation with the issue of a general consent on
December 15. This permits such issues to take place.
Local authorities are not allowed to issue Eurobonds at present, and can
only issue securities to UK investors, not foreigners. However, the
Department of the Environment, the Treasury, and the local authorities are
considering a review of the situation.
In recent years, the local authorities have obtained funding from the Public
Works Loan Board, the government agency. However, they have a tarnished
reputation with the banks, which were left facing loses of more than Pounds
560m when the House of Lords ruled that local authorities were not empowered
to enter into swap agreements.

FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Viacom 'in tough talks' with bid
partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the US cable television company, is believed to be involved in tough
negotiations with partners Nynex and Blockbuster Entertainment over the
terms on which they might back an increased Viacom bid for Paramount
Communications.
Viacom has until January 7 to raise its bid for Paramount, which is worth
around Dollars 9.3bn, to match a Dollars 10bn offer on the table from QVC
Network, the television shopping channel.
Blockbuster and Nynex are believed to be seeking better terms from Viacom
for a new injection of cash than those they received when they agreed to
back its current bid for Paramount.
Nynex, the regional telephone company serving the North-eastern US, provided
Dollars 1.2bn of funds and Blockbuster, a video rental business, Dollars
600m. In return they each received a seat on the Viacom board and preferred
stock with a 5 per cent dividend, convertible into Viacom non-voting class B
shares at Dollars 70 a share.
Viacom's class B shares, which have been depressed by the takeover battle,
stood at Dollars 43 1/2 , down Dollars 1 3/4 at the close yesterday.
Viacom has declined to comment on its bid discussions, but analysts
suggested its partners might be seeking improved conversion terms for the
preferred stock, as well as a greater say in the running of Viacom-Paramount
through additional board seats and some voting stock.
Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, owns more than 80 per cent of the
group's voting stock and would be unwilling to give up control of the
business.
Analysts suggested that Blockbuster might provide a readier source of funds
than Nynex, whose investment in Viacom has provoked criticism from certain
New York state legislators, arguing that telephone customers may end up
subsidising its foray into the entertainment industry.

The Dutch government yesterday named a troika comprised of brokerage houses
Morgan Stanley International, SG Warburg and Credit Suisse First Boston to
lead the first tranche of the privatisation of the Dutch postal and
telecommunications monopoly abroad, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
The Dutch transport and finance ministries said the latest step has
completed the basic structure needed for the flotation of the state-owned
telecom company, Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN).
The flotation of the first tranche, likely to be 25-30 per cent of the total
share capital, is expected in the first half of next year and is by some
analysts estimated to gross around Fl 4bn (Dollars 2bn) to Fl 5bn.
The names of other banks to be appointed to the syndicate that will finally
carry out the flotation will be announced in March.

FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Smaller loans that broke
Banesto's back - The excessive growth that caused the crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With hindsight, the institutions that invested Dollars 775m in Banco Espanol
de Credito last summer should perhaps have suspected what was to come.
The story of excessive loan growth which finally undid Spain's fourth
largest bank was already familiar to those who followed Banesto closely.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Spain's central bank governor, told a parliamentary
committee yesterday that Banesto's problems stemmed from an over-aggressive
expansion of loans between 1988 and 1991 as Mr Mario Conde, the chairman who
was ousted this week, tried to gain market share.
Pointing out that Banesto had expanded its loans by 109 per cent over the
three years while loans by other big Spanish banks had only risen by 55 per
cent, Mr Rojo dismissed many of the smaller loans which Banesto took on at
that time as being 'of doubtful value' because of poor credit control.
Mr Rojo participated in the decision to dismiss the Banesto board this week
after identifying a potential Pta500bn (Dollars 3.5bn) overvaluation of its
Dollars 61bn assets. He blamed mismanagement, overspending and an excessive
concentration of risk - including loans to companies it partly owns.
Yet with the exception of the charge of mismanagement, most of what Mr Rojo
had to disclose was partly foreseen in last year's offer document for a
placing of shares managed by JP Morgan. While recommending the purchase of
shares, Morgan disclosed several worrying details about Banesto.
JP Morgan has been placed in an awkward position by its role as corporate
adviser to Banesto, and as an investor through its Dollars 1.1bn Corsair
fund. Yet the US bank can at least argue that it gave a frighteningly
accurate picture of the potential for difficulties at Banesto last year.
For example, while arguing that Mr Conde had by last year brought Banesto
under control, the offer document talks of the bank's credit controls up to
1991 suffering from 'inadequate analysis, outmoded technology, inefficient
collections and a general fragmentation of functions'.
Under JP Morgan's influence, Banesto had by then curbed the loan growth
which followed Mr Conde's appointment as chairman. While the group's loan
portfolio rose by 15.3 per cent in 1990 and 15.6 per cent in 1991, this was
brought down sharply to 2.7 per cent growth in 1992.
This raised Banesto's total loan portfolio to Pta2,412bn by the end of last
year from Pta2,036bn at the end of 1990. At the same time, Morgan's advice
to be more prudent in setting aside sums to cushion the impact of Spain's
recession was leading to a sharp rise in loan loss provisions.
Banesto started putting aside large sums to cover potential problems.
Provisions of only Pta1.8bn in 1990 were increased heavily to Pta35bn in
1991 and Pta44.3bn last year. But the deterioration in loan quality was
already starting to become too pronounced even for these provisions.
The share of doubtful and non-performing loans to total loans rose from 2.82
per cent to 6.94 per cent at the end of last year. Despite the provisions
top-up, the ratio of loan loss allowances to bad and doubtful loans fell
over the same period from 104 per cent to 57.3 per cent.
This meant that Banesto was in effect slipping backwards while running
faster. The biggest consolation for potential investors was ironically the
recent actions of the Bank of Spain itself, which told Banesto to reclassify
Pta51.8bn of loans as non-performing at the end of last year.
Mr Rojo said yesterday the Bank had examined every loan of more than Pta750m
in its 1992 inspection (although Banesto and JP Morgan put the threshold at
Pta500m). Mr Conde argued strongly that this meant Banesto had in effect
been given a clean bill of health for the future.
Yet this ignored an important aspect of Banesto's loan portfolio. It was
heavily weighted towards smaller loans which slipped under the Bank of
Spain's threshold. Only 28 per cent of the loans of the Spanish bank,
excluding Portuguese and other subsidiaries, were above Pta200m.
As a result, the Bank of Spain inadvertently sent a false signal to
investors. By allowing so much weight to be placed on its initial loan
inspection, it helped give the impression that the small business and
personal loans in which Banesto specialised had been given its seal of
approval.
As it turns out, this was disastrously inaccurate. Mr Pedro Solbes, the
finance minister, told the finance committee yesterday that as the Bank of
Spain's inspectors this year examined the smaller loans which had been the
backbone of the 1988 to 1991 growth, they became extremely worried.
'The inspectors realised that the deterioration in Banesto's balance sheet
was far worse than had been expected and that it needed an urgent rescue
plan,' he said.
Mr Rojo said that 47 per cent of the bank's loan book could have been
classed as bad or doubtful at the end of last June.
The remaining uncertainty is how the Pta500bn shortfall is going to be
solved. Before the Bank of Spain's announcement, Banesto was predicting it
would only break even in 1993, implying a Pta500bn retained loss if the
whole revaluation was passed through the profit and loss account.
Such a move would more than wipe out the group's Dollars 2.8bn in equity
capital, including the Dollars 775m which was raised last year. Yet both the
governor and the finance minister emphasised yesterday they expected the
bank's share capital to take only part of the strain in a restructuring.
There would be an attempt to work out the loan portfolio, which could gain
value if Spain emerges from recession. The bank could also sell assets from
La Corporacion, the industrial holding company 85 per cent owned by Banesto,
which have an estimated liquidation value of Pta211bn.
'The bank has clear possibilities of coming out ahead,' said Mr Rojo with
what appeared an unlikely degree of optimism yesterday. Contemplating their
holdings of shares suspended at the Pta1,900 offer price, Banesto's
investors may wish that they had read the runes more carefully.

FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: MCI to compete head-on with Baby
Bells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the US long-distance telephone company, is expected to
announce a bold initiative next week to enter the local telecommunications
market and compete head-on with America's Baby Bell regional telephone
companies.
MCI declined to comment yesterday, but it is thought to be planning to spend
more than Dollars 1bn to construct local communications networks in leading
US cities to cream off business from the Baby Bells.
The company may fund the investment out of the Dollars 4.3bn it is set to
receive from British Telecom in return for a 20 per cent stake in MCI. That
deal, agreed last summer, is due for completion in 1994.
The local network initiative is thought to form a large part of a strategic
announcement by MCI next week, which may also contain other strands.
MCI played the central role in forcing competition in the US long-distance
telephone market in the 1970s and 1980s, and its entry to the local arena
could mean tough new competition for the Baby Bells.
The Bells, spun off from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's long-distance
business in 1984, have enjoyed virtual monopolies until recently.
Now, however, a growing number of rivals are nibbling away at the fringes of
their businesses. These include so-called Competitive Access Providers
(CAPs), which operate highly efficient fibre optic networks in major cities,
creaming off particularly profitable business customers by offering them
cheaper rates for bulk traffic.
Cable television service companies are also planning to offer
telecommunications services as part of new fibre-based inter-active
multi-media networks they are building to homes and offices.
One of the largest CAPs, Teleport Communications, is owned by four leading
cable companies - Tele-Communications Inc, Cox Enterprises, Time Warner and
Comcast.
MCI has acknowledged in the past holding talks with cable companies about
by-passing the Baby Bells by using cable wires to deliver its long distance
services to end-users.
MCI and other long-distance carriers, notably AT&amp;T, have long complained
about the huge fees they must pay to the Baby Bells to carry their
long-distance traffic the last few miles to customers.
These 'access charges' bear little relation to the cost of providing the
service yet account for around 30 per cent of the Baby Bells' revenues and
are the largest single expense for the long-distance groups. Setting up its
own local network would allow MCI to by-pass these charges.

FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Troubled German group to meet
banks next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled Frankfurt-based conglomerate, has brought
forward a planned meeting with its bankers to discuss the full extent of its
liquidity problems.
Frankfurt bankers said yesterday that preliminary talks between the company
and leading bankers had taken place in New York this week. Following these
talks Mr Kajo Neukirchen, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, decided to
invite all its bank creditors to a meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday of next
week, bringing the date forward from January 10.
The fact that the meeting will take place earlier than expected indicates
the group's problems are more serious than expected, bankers said.
But Metallgesellschaft refused to comment yesterday on an advance report
from the next issue of the Spiegel news magazine that Mr Neukirchen would
seek a full-scale moratorium on group debt estimated at a gross DM8bn
(Dollars 4.6bn) in order to stave off insolvency.
Metallgesellschaft, a conglomerate with activities ranging from mining and
metals to engineering and raw materials trading, said management was working
intensively on 'damage control and possibilities for a solution' to problems
which had arisen through the oil trading activities of MG Corp, its US
trading subsidiary. Details would be presented to bankers next week, the
company added.
Commenting on the report in the Spiegel, Metallgesellschaft said the DM8bn
level of indebtedness applied to the group as a whole, was offset by
considerable liquid resources, and was not unusual for a group which derived
around half its annual turnover of DM27bn from trading activities.
Full details of Metallgesellschaft's indebtedness have not been disclosed -
the group has not published a balance sheet for the financial year to
September 1993.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch said in November, before he was ousted as chief
executive, that the ratio of equity to debt was 20 per cent.
Metallgesellschaft's liquidity problems, which led earlier this month to the
forced departure of Mr Schimmelbusch and five further board directors, stem
from the oil futures trading activities of MG Corp on the New York
Mercantile Exchange (Nymex).
No details have been released but it seems likely that MG Corp contracted
forward to buy up to 160m barrels of oil in anticipation of rising oil
prices. But sharply falling oil prices have triggered steep margin calls -
cash payouts - with Nymex which are not necessarily covered by hedging
arrangements.
The cash payouts forced Mr Schimmelbusch to turn to bankers to solve what
were then described as temporary liquidity problems.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Uk Company News: Sir Alistair Frame - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alistair Frame, former chairman of RTZ Corporation, who died last Sunday
aged 64, was one of the chief architects behind what is now the world's
largest mining company.
In a 23-year career with the former Rio Tinto-Zinc, he rose to become chief
executive in 1978 and then executive chairman from 1985 to 1991.
Although RTZ was already emerging as an important force in the 1970s under
its then chairman, Sir Val Duncan, Sir Alistair was instrumental in
completing the company's transformation from an entrepreneurial finance
house into a powerful - and structured - global concern.
Under his leadership, RTZ shook off the remnants of its early blue-blooded
culture and built up a determined worldwide approach to the mining business,
acquiring substantial interests in many of the world's major mineral
dep-osits.
In the 1980s he pushed through tough management changes which tightened
central control over RTZ's sprawling business empire with its far-flung
baronies.
The crowning moment of his career was the Dollars 3.7bn acquisition in 1989
of British Petroleum's mineral interests, which included Kennecott, one of
the US' largest copper companies. This bold stroke propelled RTZ to the top
of the world mining league.
Shortly afterwards, in 1990, he relinquished top executive responsibility to
his chosen successor, Sir Derek Birkin, and took on fresh non-executive
interests outside the company.
These included the chairmanship of British Steel, Wellcome and Davy
Corporation, the last of which he joined just as it hit disastrous problems
with a North Sea oil rig contract, forcing the sale of the company to
Trafalgar House.
After that, ill health obliged him to cut back his business activities.
Scottish by birth, Sir Alistair was educated at Glasgow and Cambridge
universities and spent his early career as a nuclear scientist with the
Atomic Energy Author-ity.
The expertise he acquired at that time qualified him to testify at the
long-running inquiry into the Sizewell B nuclear station where, with
characteristic bluntness, he made sharp criticisms of the Central
Electricity Generating Board. Several of his recommendations were
subsequently taken up.
Sir Alistair was married with one daughter.

FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Catering for those in-flight requirements -
The flotation of Alpha, the airport services operation being spun off by
Forte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A red light flashes and a siren wails shortly after an innocent vegetarian
leaves the check-in desk at Heathrow.
The passenger has thrown a spanner in the works by responding to the
airline's routine question on dietary requirements. The warning is sounding
in the heart of the kitchen where the meals are being prepared for the
flight.
It might be only an hour before take-off, but by the time the plane taxis
onto the runway a vegetarian meal with the passenger's name on it will be
aboard, ready for serving.
Lights and sirens might at first seem over the top for a catering company,
but the statistics involved in getting food ready for airlines leave no room
for error. The warning, perched atop a glass and steel cabinet containing a
computer, cannot be ignored.
A manager opens the cabinet, keys in a personal code and the instruction.
The message and the answer are numbered. The control centre can relax in the
sure knowledge that the special requirement will be catered for.
In order to serve the passengers on a modern jumbo jet 40 meal carts have to
be loaded. They contain 33,000 pieces of equipment. Add on the food items,
and the total reaches 46,000 items on any flight where two meals are served.
As Mr Paul Harrison, managing director of Forte Airport Services, explains,
the business is as much concerned with logistics as with catering.
At the end of next month the company, founded 35 years ago, is being spun
off from Forte. It is expected to have a market capitalisation of Pounds
200m and will be known as Alpha. Forte will retain a 25 per cent stake.
Alpha made operating profits of Pounds 17.2m on turnover of Pounds 404.5m
for the year ending January 1993. Its sales are split 50:50 between airline
catering and airport retail. At busy airports the retail side adds what are
known as 'the weepers and greeters' to the passengers as potential
customers. But 70 per cent of the profits are expected to come from airline
catering, where Alpha will be the UK market leader, with 48 per cent of the
business.
In the first half to end July, operating profits were Pounds 11.7m on sales
of Pounds 207m.
Heathrow, the world's biggest airport, is the most competitive arena for
in-flight catering - with nine companies fighting for market share. Alpha's
Heathrow division usually prepares 14,000 meals a day, although its maximum
capacity is 20,000 meals. However, the total Alpha flight catering business
supplies 45m meals a year to 150 airlines, including British Airways,
Lufthansa, All Nippon Airways and Pakistan International.
Mr Andrew Murphy, director of the Heathrow operation, aims to run things
with military precision, but also to remain flexible. 'If it's foggy or
raining I know I've got a very interesting day ahead,' he says.
Diversions to other airports play havoc with schedules, while a delayed
flight can turn an order for breakfast into an order for lunch.
Hence the importance of the computerised control centre, and the outlying
terminals complete with sirens and lights in every department of the
operation. The progress of each flight is followed on a screen linked direct
to the airport. The catering is logged separately, flight by flight, with a
simple system using red and green lights to show the progress or otherwise
of each meal.
The cycle begins with the offloading of used meal carts from an aircraft.
The dirty crockery is sorted and the rubbish sent to a compactor that can
deal with 7.5 tonnes a day. The carts themselves are sent through a huge
washer and sterilised. The crockery is put onto belts and sent through huge
washers. The cutlery is washed, burnished in a machine that shakes it in
ball bearings, and washed again. The whole process takes just one hour.
Goods are delivered on a just-in-time basis and there is remarkably little
on the premises at any one time. There are five daily deliveries of 20
different types of rolls, and fruit and vegetables arrive at least twice a
day from two suppliers.
In one year 1m cartons of milk, 400,000 cheese portions and 150,000 kilos of
fresh strawberries are delivered. However, there are no baked beans or
sprouts - for the obvious reasons.
The goods pass to the preparation department, where exactly the right amount
for each flight is loaded onto a numbered trolley. Here can be found a woman
cutting 74 lemons into eight slices each by hand - airlines do not use
enough to make a machine worthwhile. But there are slicing machines that can
be programmed to cut a particular weight.
In the kitchen proper, the chefs are hard at work. One trolley contains
enough ingredients for 350 Lufthansa breakfasts. While the chefs can produce
Halal food, Japanese and French cuisine, some of which is very labour
intensive, some of the simple things are just as demanding - one man can
spend his eight hour shift juggling four pans to produce 1,100 omelettes.
The cooked items are quickly blast chilled and sent through to the assembly
department, where all the numbered trolleys are brought together. The
department co-ordinates the equipment from the wash, the dry goods, cooked
meals, right down to the chocolate mint.
The 'bible' of the department is the specification book, which contains
notes and full colour pictures of the tray that will be served to
passengers. This ensures that the company is keeping close to the menu
agreed with each airline customer.
The trays are loaded onto meal carts and sprayed with a 'snow' of dry ice,
and then sent to the holding fridge. When they are loaded onto a truck for
the airport, the control centre logs them carefully and the truck is sealed.
Without the right seal and documentation it will not get into the airport.
It takes three specialist trucks, costing Pounds 110,000 each, to load a
jumbo.
Given such a complex operation, it is hardly surprising that computerisation
is used. For back-up, the control centre relies on a chart system known as
the Mayfly, as each chart lives for only 24 hours.
And if all else fails? 'We use the Tannoy,' grins Mr Murphy.

FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reverse takeover for Europe Energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A list of potential car dealer-ship acquisitions is being drawn up by Mr
Gerald Davison, the former Honda executive and Keep Trust chairman who is to
lead the conversion of USM-quoted Europe Energy from a Welsh mining company
into an intended vehicle retailing group.
Mr Davison, former Inchcape director Mr Huw Pritchard and two other partners
have launched an agreed reverse takeover of Europe Energy, involving a
13-for-4 rights issue partially underwritten by Townsley, their adviser.
The Pounds 1.8m proceeds will be used mainly to pay off the debts of Europe
Energy, which earlier this month reported an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds
75,000. The remainder will help finance the first of what Mr Davison said
will become a chain of vehicle dealerships.
Although a first acquisition has not been publicly identified, it is
expected to involve further fund-raising, the probable suspension of the
shares and reassessment of the company's USM status.
Mr Davison will take over as chairman and chief executive from Lord
Torrington at an extraordinary meeting to approve the restructuring on
January 10. He said the company's mining activities would continue although
a buyer might be sought.

FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel shares up on concession
extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Eurotunnel rose sharply yesterday following news that the group
had won an extra 10 years on its concession to operate the Channel tunnel.
The shares closed at 597p, up 34p.
Dealers said that the market had been boosted mainly by French buying
interest. More than 60 per cent of the shares are held in France.
In return for the extended concession, Eurotunnel has dropped most of its
claims of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn against the British and French
governments for extra costs that arose through safety, security and
environmental measures. The total cost of the tunnel is expected to be about
Pounds 10bn, compared with Pounds 6bn in 1987.
Eurotunnel's concession will now last for 65 years, taking it through to
2052.
Mr Graham Corbett, finance director, said yesterday that the deal would not
accelerate progress towards the planned rights issue in the spring, but
would facilitate it. The earliest a rights issue could be made would be
March.
Eurotunnel has to reach agreement with its banks by next Tuesday on a
refinancing plan for a further Pounds 1bn, of which at least Pounds 500m
should come from the rights issue.
It needs the money, in addition to the Pounds 8.95bn already raised, before
it can start operations.
Analysts suggested yesterday that the share price increase was driven purely
by sentiment over the extension of the concession. But they agreed that the
deal would ease the group's negotiations with its bankers.
Mr Corbett said that in the past six months the group had resolved several
difficult issues, including disputes with Transmanche Link, the main
contractor, and Bombardier, the Canadian supplier of trains for the tunnel
shuttle service.
'We are gradually knocking them down like skittles,' he said.

FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Rescue package agreed as Ossory cuts loss
to Pounds 40.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ossory Estates, the property group, yesterday announced a reduction in
pre-tax losses from Pounds 46.1m to Pounds 40.2m in the year to June 30,
after lower write-downs against its property portfolio.
A forecast earlier this month predicted that pre-tax losses would not exceed
Pounds 41m. This coincided with proposals for a rescue package, approved by
shareholders this week, which involves a financial restructuring, including
a placing and open offer to raise Pounds 5.5m cash net of expenses, as well
as some acquisitions.
Following the reconstruction and new banking proposals pro forma net assets
are Pounds 11m compared with Pounds 22.5m in liabilities last time.
Last year's accounts had been qualified following the breach of banking
covenants.
The reorganised board is to rename the company Orb.
Turnover rose to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 12.9m), including a Pounds 2.79m
(Pounds 5.01m) contribution from discontinued operations.
Ossory wrote off Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 42.7m) against its investment
properties while interest costs were Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 8.72m), including
Pounds 5.22m relating to loan agreement settlement costs.
Losses per share were 43.95p (53.15p).

FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BG Technology poised for cable TV move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City dealmakers Luke Johnson and Stephen Hargrave are about to invade the
world of cable television with a Pounds 15m deal expected to be announced in
the next two weeks.
Shares in Baillie Gifford Technology, the investment trust, were suspended
yesterday at 31p, pending announcement of the deal.
The shares have risen sharply from 15p in recent weeks, after Mr Johnson and
Mr Hargrave were appointed to the board in November to seek an acquisition.
BG Technology is understood to be in advanced talks with a provider of
services and supplies to the cable television industry about a reverse
takeover. The target company is thought to be an installation and
contracting firm based in the south-east.
The deal is likely to involve a substantial rights issue and an
institutional placing at a significant discount to last night's share price
to raise more than Pounds 8m. The group, which will change its name as part
of the deal, will be capitalised at about Pounds 15m.
Mr Johnson, a former analyst with Kleinwort Benson, is known in the City for
two achievements: writing the book, How to Get a Highly Paid Job in the
City, just two weeks before the 1987 stock market crash; and orchestrating
several reverse takeovers since he went solo in 1987.
While some enterprises have been less successful than others, Mr Johnson
appears to have had a run of good luck in 1993. Most recently, he and Mr
Hargrave, a former financial journalist, helped to bring Crabtree, a
printing machine maker, to the market through a Pounds 20.4m reverse
takeover of the quoted shell Somerset Trust. The shares, which were 178p at
the time of the deal, closed yesterday at 271p.
Mr Johnson was also behind the acquisition of Pizza Express by Star
Computers, currently trading at 113p against a price of 43p at the time of
the deal.
Mr Johnson and Mr Hargrave will be investing between Pounds 375,000 and
Pounds 500,000 for a 41 per cent stake in BG Technology upon completion of
the deal. However, the stake is likely to be substantially reduced through
the rights issue and placing.
Management of the new company will retain roughly one third of the equity.
Mr Johnson is likely to remain on the board as an executive director.
The shares are expected to resume trading in February after an extraordinary
meeting to approve the deal.
BG Technology has been seeking to wind itself up for some three years after
a mixed track record in investing in high-technology private companies. Some
85p has been returned to shareholders through a steady liquidation of
assets. The group retains three shareholdings and has a net asset per share
value of 7.3p.

FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort tops takeover table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of mergers and acquisitions among public companies declined by 60
per cent over the past 12 months according to industry estimates published
yesterday.
Figures compiled by Acquisitions Monthly, the financial magazine, put the
value of successful bids for UK public companies at Pounds 3bn in 1993,
compared with Pounds 7.5bn last year.
The decline - part of a downward trend which has continued since 1989 when
activity peaked at Pounds 55bn - has led to a shake-up in the magazine's
annual league table of financial advisers and depressed the fees received by
merchant banks.
SG Warburg, which last year topped the table as advisers on successful and
failed bids worth Pounds 7.65bn, has slipped from first to 12th place. In
1993 it took part in seven deals totaling just Pounds 138m.
Kleinwort Benson emerged as the new league leader, although the combined
Pounds 1.33bn value of its eight deals represented a decline of 82 per cent
on Warburg's 1992 total.
Industry analysts said yesterday that changes in the rankings had been
exaggerated by the paucity of large public bids. There were only two deals
worth more than Pounds 500m compared with five such bids in 1992.
Kleinwort's ascendancy, up from 10th place last year, was boosted by its
advisory role with Central Television, the target of an agreed Pounds 758m
bid from Carlton.
The other large bid was Granada's hostile Pounds 660m hostile offer for LWT,
which is unlikely to be resolved before February next year. Granada is being
advised by Lazard, which finished sixth in the 1993 table with seven deals
worth Pounds 408m.
Acquisitions Monthly said the TV bids were due to the government's
relaxation of ownership rules rather than an abrupt change of sentiment in
the takeover market.
'Fees earned by the City's merchant bankers, accountants and solicitors from
mergers and acquisitions work fell to Pounds 100m from Pounds 110m in 1992,'
the magazine added.
Some of the banks featured in the table criticised it for focusing on public
sector activity and not taking account of private buy-outs and divestments.
SG Warburg, which is expected to emerge as the league leader among advisers
on private activity, said it had been involved in private deals worth Pounds
3.2bn.
The relatively stable private sector business helped offset the slowdown in
public activity, although Acquisitions Monthly said the total value of all
deals - public and private takeovers, buy-outs and divestments - fell by
13.3 per cent to Pounds 17.2bn (Pounds 19.8bn).
A senior executive at Warburg said merchant banks had reacted by putting
more resources into restructuring, rights issues and flotations.
'We've seen more issues to rebuild balance sheets and divestments to slim
down companies. Mergers and acquisition should pick up next year as the
cycle continues.'
Warburg's view was echoed at NM Rothschild, which slipped from fifth to 11th
place in the league table.
Mr Russell Edey, the bank's head of corporate finance, said: 'I'm
disappointed with our placing but we've made money doing other things,
particularly cross-border activity and overseas disposals.'
The importance of the M&amp;A figures was also played down by Lord Rockley,
chairman of Kleinwort Benson.
'Corporate finance has grown at the expense of mergers and acquisitions this
year. There's been more rationalising of businesses and fewer takeover
opportunities,' he said.
Lord Rockley predicted that in 1994 the buoyant stock market would lead to a
pick-up in M&amp;A activity, although it was unlikely to return to the heights
of the late 1980s.

FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham Pounds 6m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Buckingham International, the property, hotels and nursing group which
announced interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 62.5m and a breach of banking
covenants in September, is to raise Pounds 6.4m with the sale of its nursing
homes division.
The division, which is being sold to Unicare, a private nursing homes
operator, produced profits before interest of Pounds 1.1m for the year ended
November 1. The business has a book value of Pounds 6.7m.
The group also announced that the first in its planned disposals to reduce
debt of Pounds 95.5m had been delayed. The sale of its Portuguese hotels
subsidiary which owns and operates the Holiday Inn in Lisbon, failed to meet
its December 29 deadline. The company said the buyer was still keen, but
more time was needed to negotiate with holders of Buckingham International's
loan stock 1995, part of the security for which is the Lisbon Holiday Inn.
The deadline to complete the sale of Morlaix de Portugal Investimentos
Hoteleiros e Turisticos had been extended to February 28.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Options scramble behind FT-SE moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The expiry of some Pounds 4bn of over-the-counter options (OTCs) has been
one of the main factors behind sharp movements in the London stock market
over the past two days.
A prime reason for the surge which took the FT-SE 100 index to a peak of
3,480.8 yesterday was share buying by investment funds and banks to cover
their OTC positions.
Many funds have been buying 'bespoke puts', which give an option to sell the
underlying market at a fixed time and price, and selling calls, to lock in
profits made earlier in the year. Few fund managers, however, were able to
allow for the latest rise which has lifted the stock market by about 9 per
cent since the November 30 Budget.
The principal expiry yesterday involved an institution which had bought a
'zero cost collar', an OTC covering call options and put options in about 30
leading Footsie stocks. It was one of a number of OTC deals, mostly carried
out by Swiss Bank Corporation, which have expired this week.
Once the positions were covered, buying pressure eased yesterday and
profit-taking took the FT-SE 100 to 3,428.8, down 33.2 on the day.
Mr Chris Salter, head of UK trading at SBC, said: 'The OTC market has really
picked up in London this year and we have carried out a large percentage of
the recent transactions.'
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and UBS have also been
providing OTC insurance against falls in the market for US income funds, UK
investment funds, UK life assurance funds and some pension groups.
Mr Guru Ramakrishnan, derivatives specialist at Morgan Stanley, the US
investment bank, said: 'I am continually astounded by the increasing number
of accounts using OTCs, but they do offer considerable flexibility and
anonymity at a fair price.'
The main difference between traded options dealt on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange and OTCs is that OTCs are secret - only the
seller (writer) and buyer are aware of the details because they are not
traded through an exchange.
They are also more flexible than traded options having an expiry price and
maturity date that can be agreed by the two parties involved. The main
criticism is that it is difficult to make a market, but supporters say that
for any one OTC there are around half a dozen participants prepared to make
a price.
Awareness of OTCs has grown considerably this year, along with the use of
derivative products generally. Although there are no figures available
because of the anonymous nature of the market, dealers estimate that the
nominal value of OTCs on the FT-SE 100 index runs into billions of pounds.
Some derivatives analysts say there could be further volatility in today's
end-of-year half session as another large OTC option expires.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Ugly duckling sheds old-fashioned feathers: The
rehabilitation of Standard Chartered bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Musing on the sudden popularity of Standard Chartered, Mr Malcolm Williamson
compares his bank with a teenager who is leaving behind the awkwardness of
childhood. 'As you cease to be an ugly young girl and become attractive,
some of the boys are bound to get excited,' he says.
Excited is putting it mildly. Even by the standard of banking - one of the
strongest performing sectors in the London stock market in 1993 - Standard
Chartered blossomed. The old colonial bank that has not yet shaken off the
image of being accident prone and indifferently managed has nonetheless
managed to double the price of its shares to a heady 1234p.
Unfortunately for the new management, which took over in May on the
retirement of the former chairman and chief executive, Mr Rodney Galpin,
this has little to do with them. It is mainly a matter of history: Standard
has an exceptionally strong franchise in the growing markets of Hong Kong
and the Asia Pacific, built up over 140 years by the chartered banks from
which it was formed.
Standard's transformation into being a prime emerging markets play has been
sudden indeed. It has been an ugly duckling among UK banks for most of the
past decade, with a chapter of accidents including last year's Pounds 293m
provisions and write-downs against the Indian securities market scandal,
contributing to an indifferent rating and speculation about it being taken
over.
Mr Williamson, who became chief executive with the accession of Mr Patrick
Gillam as non-executive chairman, argues that it has now emerged from the
worst vulnerability. 'There is no particular reason why anyone should have a
tilt at us, and it would be quite expensive now,' he says. Yet he and Mr
Gillam have a lot to achieve before Standard's rehabilitation is assured.
The bank has suffered from three core problems:
Earnings have been extremely volatile. Earnings per share fluctuated from
113p to a loss of 53.6p between 1988 and 1989. This is partly because it has
consistently poured cash down unexpected holes such as Bombay, but also
because it operates in many fast-growing economies which produce high
returns at the top of the cycle, but are also at risk from sudden falls in
asset prices.
Management has been poor. Standard's colonial roots created a federal
structure which gave its country managers a lot of autonomy. The bank
exerted too little control from London on the balance of its businesses and
did not monitor adequately the operational, credit and market risks it was
running.
It has been under-capitalised. Its equity to assets ratio has fallen
steadily over the past five years and it has just bolstered its capital with
a Pounds 100m issue of preference shares. Apart from paying uncovered
dividends between 1989 and 1991, the devaluation of sterling against the
dollar has weakened the ratio of its sterling equity to overseas assets in
currencies which track the dollar.
In spite of the weight of history, most brokers are now bullish. 'There is a
good story here,' says Mr Robert Law, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
'Standard now has a very strong management team that is focusing on business
where they have a good franchise and running down the marginal ones. You are
starting to see the underlying profitability of the bank coming through.'
There is little disputing Standard's formidable earnings potential. Its
shares, despite their rise, are still only trading at between 10 and 12
times brokers' estimates for full-year earnings, which is not demanding for
banks in the Asia Pacific area. Such earnings should ease its capital
problem, but will not address those of poor management and earnings
volatility.
Mr Gillam lists the ways he and Mr Williamson are trying to address these
two issues. He has attempted to improve management by recruiting senior
executives from outside the bank and by imposing stronger controls. Among
those recruited this year are Mr Peter Wood, the former Barclays finance
director, to head the new combined function of finance and risk management.
The bank is now trying to set stronger central guidelines from London. These
are implemented by regional management 'hubs', including one in Dubai
controlling the Middle East and South Asia. Mr Williamson says this means
that Indian operations are now monitored from a hub 'only a couple of hours
flying time away. That gives us an infinitely better degree of control.'
The need to improve the quality of earnings is being addressed in several
ways. One is to reduce assets in countries which produce poor returns,
including Africa and most OECD countries. Mr Gillam says that it may
eventually confine operations outside Asia and other fast-growth economies
to trade finance, and capital markets and treasury functions.
Standard is also trying to increase its flows of non-interest income, both
by providing services to companies, and by acting as a financial
intermediary rather than using its balance sheet. Mr Gillam cites the
example of China, where it lacks the capital strength to lend large amounts
for big projects, and wants to act more like an investment bank by arranging
and syndicating loans.
This raises the question of how much capital it needs. Mr Law is among those
who argue that Standard needs a much stronger capital base to operate in
risky countries, and points out that other Asian banks maintain a ratio of
tier 1 capital (largely equity and retained earnings) to risk-weighted
assets of more than 7 per cent. Standard's tier 1 ratio in the first half
was 5.4 per cent.
Mr Gillam believes the bank would be over-capitalised if the ratio rose
above 7 per cent, although he is aiming for at least 6 per cent. That does
not seem too testing a target given the earnings which Standard can expect
over the next three years. But he says that even when capital is restored to
a healthy level, the bank will remain cautious about expanding assets in the
Asia Pacific.
Indeed, the whole mood at Standard is one of caution. Mr Gillam admits that
the management has not yet demonstrated the ability to produce consistently
high returns. But he brushes aside talk of the bank being an untameable
beast. 'I do not think it is axiomatic that this institution is more
hazardous than others, providing it is well run. That is our challenge.'

FT  31 DEC 93 / BAe sells Ballast Nedam for Pounds 175m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace has sold Ballast Nedam, its Dutch construction subsidiary
for Fl 500m (Pounds 175m) to a consortium including Internationale
Nederlanden Group (ING), the Dutch financial services group, and Hochtief,
one of Germany's largest construction companies.
The sale ends a six-year relationship between Ballast Nedam and BAe, which
acquired the Dutch company for Pounds 47m in 1987 to support its bid to win
up to Pounds 30bn of Saudi Arabian defence contracts.
The Al Yamamah contracts, which originally envisaged the construction of a
new airbase 480km south of Riyadh, have since been scaled down and proposals
for the base have been shelved.
Saudi Arabia accounts for about a third of Ballast Nedam's annual turnover.
Nonetheless the subsidiary was regarded as no longer central to BAe's
business.
Plans to sell the company for about Fl 500m to Boskalis, the Dutch dredging
company, collapsed before Christmas.
Hoare Govett, which advised BAe on the sale to ING and Hochtief, said the
sale price matched the Pounds 175m book value of Ballast Nedam.
The former BAe subsidiary earned net profits of Fl 83.7m in 1992. The
company, which also has an aggregates dredging business, generates most of
its sales in continental Europe, mostly in the Netherlands, and in Saudi
Arabia.
Under the terms of the deal, ING will initially hold a 49.99 per cent stake
in Ballast Nedam with Hochtief acquiring 48 per cent. The remaining 2.01 per
cent stake goes to the Ballast Nedam pension fund.
Ballast Nedam said yesterday that it planned to float its shares on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange early in the new year.
ING intends to sell part of its stake to Internationale Nederlanden
Verzekeringen, its insurance division before the flotation. In addition it
will sell a 3 per cent stake to a new trust company owned by Ballast Nedam's
management and staff.
Ballast Nedam said yesterday that it had agreed with Hochtief that the
German group would not acquire a majority of the shares.
An irony is that Ballast Nedam's chairman resigned earlier this year when
BAe turned down his plan for a flotation on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
The company said yesterday that it expected 1993 turnover to rise 6 per cent
to Fl 2.6bn and repeated its forecast that net profits would total about Fl
80m.
It added that its order book had grown this year to Fl 3.3bn, up from Fl
2.3bn in 1992.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Shell links to Italian group in chemicals venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Dutch Shell and Montedison, the industrial arm of the collapsed
Ferruzzi empire, yesterday agreed to form a Dollars 6.6bn (Pounds 4.5bn)
joint venture, merging part of their chemicals businesses.
The venture will bring together most of the two companies' polyolefin
activities to form the world's largest polypropylene producer.
Shell estimated that the joint venture, which will operate as a stand-alone
company, would have polypropylene capacity of about 3.3m tonnes, nearly a
fifth of global capacity. At 700,000 tonnes, its polyethelene capacity will
represent only a few per cent of worldwide capacity.
Both companies have been hit by the recession in Europe's over-extended
petrochemical industry, although Montedison's problems are more pressing.
Polypropylene prices have more than halved in the past three years.
The companies said the agreement offered important benefits. Montedison's
chemicals subsidiaries possessed world-leading technology, while Shell had
extensive raw materials. Shell had a strong market presence in northern
Europe and Asia, and Montedison in southern Europe and America.
The venture will account for about a tenth of the turnover of Shell's
loss-making chemicals divisions. Last month the division reported a
third-quarter loss of Pounds 168m, against a Pounds 41m loss for the same
period last year.
The deal has been under discussion between Shell and Montedison's
wholly-owned subsidiary, Himont, since September 1992. But it was delayed by
the collapse in May of the Ferruzzi family's business empire and the
subsequent need for creditors to accept a restructuring of L28,000bn (Pounds
11bn) of debt.
Just before Christmas, the second phase of the Ferruzzi restructuring plan
was agreed and this cleared the barriers to the Shell deal.
The deal has been structured to avoid anti-trust objections both in Europe
and the US and involves no financial outlays by either side.
Montedison will be transferring all its productive operations in these
sectors held by Himont and Moplefan with an estimated book value of Dollars
4.4bn, as well as Dollars 2bn worth of debt.
The latter is important for Montedison's balance sheet because this debt
will be de-consolidated. This was not calculated in the Ferruzzi-Montedison
restructuring plan that envisages cutting Montedison's net debt from
L14,000bn to L4,900bn by 1996.
For its part Shell will be transfering Dollars 2.2bn worth of polyolefin
assets but no debt. The assets include the majority of its worldwide
operations in this sector.
Specifically excluded are Shell operations in Germany (Rheinische
Olefinwerke, a joint venture with BASF); Singapore (TPC, a venture in which
Shell holds 30 per cent); and Japan (Mitsubishi Yuka KK, in which Shell has
20 per cent).
Each partner will appoint four board members but the choice of chief
executive is likely to fall to Shell. The head office will be in the
Netherlands, but research - an important element with Himont's Spheriline
technology coming on stream - will be in Ferrara, Italy.
In 1992 Himont had sales of L2,082bn and operating profits of L237bn. This
year's sales are forecast at about L3,000bn, almost double those of Shell's
operations to be included in the new company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg was unlucky to drop from first to 12th place in the league of
takeover advisers in 1993. But the table simply confirms the low level of
merger activity. If demergers were included too, Warburg's role as adviser
to ICI/Zeneca would propel it into first place. Since ICI was worth almost
Pounds 9bn when Zeneca was spun off, Warburg would even make Kleinwort
Benson, this year's leader, look like a bit player with just Pounds 1.3bn
worth of transactions.

FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Poland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Astonishing though it may seem, Poland has been the best performing European
bourse of 1993. The market, which re-opened in 1991 after a break of 52
years, has risen more than 11-fold this year. Even in US dollar terms, the
WIG index has increased six times. Despite the re-election of a mainly
communist government, western stockbrokers have been waxing lyrical about
the emergence of Europe's first tiger economy. Investors have plunged into
the Polish market since the summer, buying 20 per cent of its shares.
Poland's economy remains fragile but recent trends are encouraging.
Industrial production, which has dropped 40 per cent from its peak, will
perhaps have grown 4 per cent this year, making Poland one of the fastest
growing European economies. That growth rate may rise to 7 per cent by the
second half of the decade. Inflation has been tamed, if not suppressed. The
budget deficit shames many a western European government. The private sector
accounts for more than half of Poland's output. Poland's low labour costs
and skilled workforce make it an attractive manufacturing base.
The Polish stock market remains immature and minuscule: the 22 listed
companies have a value of only Dollars 2bn - the size of a small FT-SE 100
company. The market is also prone to the volatility and illiquidity fears
that plague any emerging market. But who said Europe was sclerotic?

FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK advertising
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those idyllic days when advertising agencies grew at 20 per cent a year and
boasted 20 per cent profit margins now seem beyond the imagination of even
the most creative copywriter. But it seems equally implausible that big
chunks of the industry will continue to work for next to nothing. According
to Touche Ross, 15 of the top 50 advertising agencies incurred pre-tax
losses in 1992, with the average operating margin falling to 6.3 per cent.
This year, investors have been quick to latch on to the sector's recovery
appeal with forecasts suggesting that UK display advertising could grow by 8
per cent in 1994. Costs have been cut brutally. Theoretically, that should
ensure profits rebound smartly when volumes recover.
But advertising is another industry where it is difficult to disentangle
short-term cyclical influences from longer-term structural forces.
Specialist media buying agencies have permanently eroded buying commissions.
Moreover, the fuss over brands following Philip Morris's move in cutting the
price of its Marlboro line has concentrated advertisers' minds, leading many
to cut promotional spend and concentrate on everyday low pricing instead.
There seems little reason why UK agencies cannot match the margins attained
by their US counterparts. Both Interpublic and Omnicom achieve operating
margins double those of most UK agencies. But that does rashly presuppose
that UK agencies can be just as soberly managed.

FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Metallgesellschaft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft's new management is still not ready to reveal the extent
of the problems it has unearthed. The news that it has brought forward its
bank creditors' meeting and that its gross debt is DM8bn is disconcerting
nonetheless. Gross debt has doubled since its last balance sheet in
September 1992, when group equity was incidentally just DM3.7bn. The need
for a debt rescheduling is becoming increasingly apparent, but the
negotiation may be particularly tortuous, given Metallgesellschaft's
far-flung network of subsidiaries, many of which involve substantial outside
shareholders.
It thus looks as though the German banks will not be able simply to impose
their own solution. Indeed, there must already have been a strong temptation
for overseas banks to abuse Deutsche and Dresdner Bank's commitment to
provide liquidity by seeking to call in some of their own loans. That alone
would be grounds for bringing the creditors' meeting forward. In the short
run, arms may have to be twisted but a longer-term answer might be to slim
down the group and simplify its structure by selling off subsidiaries in
countries such as Canada and Australia, but that would also involve
stripping out mainstream businesses in metals and mining.

FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Unlucky dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the equity markets have been getting glowing end-of-year reports, the
same cannot be said of the dollar. The consensus at the start of the year
was that it would rise above DM1.80. Instead it still has not recovered its
July peak of DM1.74 despite this week's spurt on the back of relatively
strong US economic statistics. The question is whether it will fulfil in
1994 the expectations that were invested in it for 1993.
Now, as then, the US economy looks stronger than that of Germany and the
transatlantic interest differential is expected to narrow. One reason why
this failed to provide much support for the dollar in 1993 may be that the
US recovery was not strong enough to require tighter Federal Reserve policy.
The D-Mark was also supported, at least until September, by strains in the
ERM and subsequently by the relative caution of the Bundesbank in cutting
interest rates.
Yet the past year has seen a substantial narrowing of the interest
differential as German rates came down. Three-month D-Marks cost nearly 6
percentage points more than US dollar deposits in January. Now the
difference is less than 3 points. Ten-year German government bonds are
actually trading at a yield 30 basis points lower than their US equivalent,
which should make for a much stronger dollar. Its upward progress may remain
anaemic unless the US recovery reaches the point where the market believes
more than one round of Fed tightening will be needed.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Israel offers to share control of borders with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel has offered to share control with Palestinians of the border crossing
points with neighbouring states. Officials see it as a final attempt to
break the deadlock in negotiations on Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza
Strip and Jericho.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday that the proposal,
which Israeli officials claim was broadly agreed by the two delegations in
Cairo this week, has not been accepted. The PLO is insisting that it alone
should control the crossings.
Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, a senior PLO official who attended the Cairo talks,
said the PLO had not agreed to the draft text and accused Israel of
exaggerating the extent of agreement. 'There is no joint agreement. It is a
paper which includes the Israeli views,' he said. 'We hope that these kinds
of exaggerations, which we consider as an attempt to bluff, will not
undermine the present form of negotiations.'
Another PLO negotiator, Mr Nabil Shaath, said last night that Israeli and
Palestinian teams would spend the next two weeks in the Egyptian resort of
Taba attempting to reach agreement. Mr Shaath said he had sent the Israelis
a paper describing possible compromises.
According to the draft document, released in Jerusalem, Israel would
maintain control over external security, except at crossing points between
Jordan and Jericho, and Egypt and Gaza.
At those points both sides would have a veto over travellers seeking to
enter Gaza and Jericho. Each side would have separate windows within one
terminal building. Checks would be carried out electronically and leading
Palestinians would be exempt from the procedures.
The proposal marks a climbdown from earlier Israeli demands to maintain sole
control over the entry points. Israel has also doubled its original offer of
the land area around Jericho to be administered by the Palestinians to about
56 sq km.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, and Mr Yossi Sarid, the
environment minister, continued to insist yesterday that the proposal was
broadly agreed by the PLO team and merely needed final approval from Mr
Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman.
Mr Sarid said it seemed that Mr Arafat had refused to back the judgment of
his negotiating team. 'As one who was there, I can say in the clearest and
most authoritative way that the understandings which are being discussed
were acceptable to the heads of the PLO, but are unacceptable to the PLO
leader.'
Foreign diplomats said Israel, by releasing the text of the draft proposal,
was trying to force the PLO to accept the deal as a 'final offer'. Mr Peres
also warned that the April 13 deadline for Israel to complete its military
withdrawal would not be guaranteed if talks continued to drag on.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Shanghai to resume old role as China's financial capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shanghai will resume its place as China's financial centre as part of the
country's currency and financial reforms to be introduced tomorrow .
Details published yesterday of plans announced on Wednesday to unify the
exchange rate made clear that Shanghai, the financial and trading hub of
pre-revolutionary China, would be the centre of a new currency dealing
network.
It also became clear that controls over the use of foreign currency by both
Chinese and foreigners will remain strict and will even be tightened in some
respects.
The government said it would enforce a ban on circulation of foreign
currency in China, though economists in Hong Kong said this would be
difficult.
The currency reforms take effect tomorrow at the same time as a fundamental
reshaping of the taxation system. Banking is also being restructured to
create a true central bank and streamlined commercial banks which will
permit monetary control and credit allocation along western, market-oriented
lines.
The new banking system is to be the base for a national interbank foreign
exchange market. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, will post a
daily official rate for the yuan based on conditions in this market and
taking into account the dollar's international performance.
The market will take some time to establish. In the meantime, foreign
exchange trading will continue in 'swap centres' across the country.
Shanghai has the largest of these and its centre will become a national hub
linked via computer to other main cities. A mansion which housed the central
bank before the second world war will be the site for a new trading floor.
Shanghai also plans to establish an interbank money market and a national
gold market during 1994, and is expected to see growing trade in government
bonds. Its stock and commodity markets are flourishing and it plans to
establish a futures exchange.
The fast pace at which China is proceeding with reforms, even before
creation of the means to carry them out, suggests that the Communist party
leadership is united behind them despite the vulnerability of the booming
economy to inflation and overheating.
However, controls on Chinese wishing to use foreign currency remain tight.
Individuals must produce certificates authorising purchase of foreign
currency, and will be allowed an amount based on the number of days they
will be abroad, an official said.
Foreign companies will be allowed to buy hard currency with yuan, but
foreign individuals will be banned from changing yuan into other currencies.
Economists in Hong Kong said it would be very difficult for China to enforce
a ban on the use of foreign currency. Although prohibited, foreign currency
is frequently used by mainlanders.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Health and safety overhaul unlikely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's deregulation bill due to be published in mid-January will
not include the wholesale revision of health and safety legislation which
was hinted at by ministers and feared by trade unions.
The bill is expected to say very little about existing health and safety
legislation apart from referring to a separate review of legislation by the
Health and Safety Commission which began last May and is expected to report
in March.
That review is not expected to recommend significant change and, according
to Ms Angela Orr-Ewing of the HSC, the consultation period, which ends next
month, 'has not attracted a large response'.
The sweeping away of bureaucratic safety legislation was supposed to be one
of the central pieces of the deregulation bill. But aside from the weeding
out of some obsolete legislation, a constant process since the 1974 Health
and Safety at Work Act came into effect, there is little scope or demand for
wholesale change, Whitehall officials say.
'People are always saying that business is hampered by safety laws but when
they try and find specific examples they rarely come up with anything.
Health and safety laws are usually there for a good reason and they are
applied in a pretty flexible way,' one official said.
Backing away from radical changes to health and safety laws may ensure the
deregulation bill an easier passage through the House of Lords.
The government is planning to get rid of hundreds of regulations without
seeking primary legislation, in order to bypass debate in the Commons. But
in view of reservations about this method ministers are considering some
form of parliamentary scrutiny. The deregulation initiative was first
announced last July when task forces to abolish red tape were established in
seven sectors: construction; food, drink and agriculture; chemicals and
pharmaceuticals; communications and transport; engineering; financial
services; and other services.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secertary, reported that the separate HSC
review of safety legislation had identified 30 regulations to be abolished.
In almost all cases this was because they had been superseded.
A Department of Trade and Industry working party subsequently identified
several areas where health regulations could be abolished which led to
speculation about fundamental reform.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Sang froid in the heat of battle: Edouard Balladur, French
prime minister, is the FT's Man of the Year. He talks to David Buchan and
Andrew Gowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edouard Balladur has surprised everyone, including probably himself.
In his nine months as France's prime minister, he has proved more
consistently popular than any other political leader in the country - indeed
in the west - despite recession and record unemployment. Cohabiting
harmoniously with a Socialist president, he has embarked on a major
programme to privatise state industry. He has weathered a summer currency
crisis that seemed to dash France's hopes for European monetary union, but
emerged with his dignity intact and the franc back at its old rate against
the D-mark.
To cap it all, earlier this month he finessed the Gatt negotiations in a way
that gave the world its Uruguay Round trade agreement, saved the European
Union from a serious political crisis, and kept him in his job  - in the
process consolidating his position as the undeclared front-runner for the
1995 French presidential elections. If he goes on to win, this courteous,
somewhat ponderous man, who was appointed prime minister precisely because
he did not seem likely to become a power in his own right, will have changed
the face of French politics.
In a year-end interview in his elegant Matignon office, Mr Balladur allows
himself to revel a little in the unexpected nature of it all. 'It is
paradoxical that the French have evidently still a good opinion of me, and
yet apparently believe they are badly governed,' he says. He is still
scoring more than 55 per cent in opinion polls which, however, also show
that nearly two-thirds of the French are unhappy with the way the country is
run and more than two-thirds think things are getting worse.
Yet he is clearly beginning to think that the stars favour him. He is amused
at how he has bounced back after every punch: 'At the start, people said my
honeymoon would never last beyond the summer. Then came the August monetary
crisis. I thought it would be seen as a setback for the government, but it
wasn't. Then came . . . the unfortunate affair of the Air France strike,
which led to a torrent of criticism against me in the Anglo-Saxon press.
'Finally, there was Gatt. People outside France wondered if I was a
statesman with the courage to face down my own farmers and sign a Gatt
agreement, while others in France wondered whether I would have the courage
to . . . refuse to sign.'
But why the resilient poll ratings? When he was last in government, as
finance minister in the first conservative cohabitation with President
Francois Mitterrand in 1986-88, he was not popular and was mocked in the
press for a smug manner.
Tentatively, Mr Balladur offers two explanations. 'Maybe they're saying they
can see I'm not responsible for the current situation since I have not been
in government for very long. Perhaps, too. . . people see that cohabitation
is going well, that I keep myself a bit apart from daily political
squabbles.'
Such comments are typical of his low-key style. France does appear exhausted
by the left-right struggle of the last few years, and by the campaign for
the March parliamentary elections in which the centre-right parties, the RPR
and UDF, crushed the ruling Socialists. Mr Balladur's strengths are an
ability to appear above the fray; a fearsome appetite for technical detail,
which helps to deprive contentious issues of political sting; and a
pragmatism enabling him to perform effortless U-turns and, often, to sound
plausible in claiming victory out of defeat.
It is with the same sang froid that he has faced the crises of his first
nine months, and dealt with the unexploded mines - unsustainable economic
and monetary policies and Gatt - left behind by the Socialists.
He concedes he initially misjudged the extent of the French recession, which
saw a 0.7 per cent drop in gross domestic product in the first quarter of
1993. His main preoccupation was the dire deficits in the public finances.
'It seemed to me we could not let things carry on like that, because the
deficits were sustaining feelings of morosity and worry about the future.
There was an intimate psychological link between the recovery of economic
activity and the struggle against the deficits.'
Mr Balladur's first act, to cut spending and raise taxes in his May budget,
arguably deepened the gloom. But after a burst of criticism from within the
centre-right majority, he swiftly came up with the 'Balladur bond', a public
issue which raised FFr110bn (Pounds 12.6bn) to fight unemployment. He also
vigorously launched his privatisation programme, which with this year's sale
of Banque Nationale de Paris, two smaller banks and Rhone-Poulenc, the
chemicals group, has already realised some FFr43bn.
But Mr Balladur's moment of truth was the summer crisis in the European
Monetary System. After the Bank of France had lost its foreign exchange
reserves in a vain defence of the franc at its old parity, many foreign
observers concluded a huge hole had been blown in Mr Balladur's credibility.
But instead of burying his franc fort policy, he picked himself up and
behaved as if nothing much had happened.
Mr Balladur seems almost serene about that crisis now. It is not just that
he is pleased to see the franc back near its old rate against the D-mark. He
also appears philosophical about the disappearance of the EMS's old tight
fluctuation bands of 2.25 per cent.
He brushes aside theories of Anglo-Saxon conspiracy against the EMS. Then,
in a remarkable feat of monetary hindsight, he admits that the premise for
the franc fort policy was fundamentally flawed: 'To try to maintain
quasi-fixed parities with divergent monetary and budgetary policies is a
nonsense. It cannot last eternally.' The decision to widen the EMS bands to
15 per cent - made at his suggestion - can now be claimed as a victory for
common sense and Mr Balladur.
The prime minister bridles at charges that he has not taken full advantage
of France's new-found monetary freedom by not cutting interest rates more
aggressively since August. European governments are virtually obliged to
have similar interest rates - even cut-and-run Britain, says Mr Balladur,
sending aides scurrying to find charts showing UK short-term interest rates
not appreciably below France's.
Despite lower rates he is characteristically cautious about the prospects
for the economy, sticking to a forecast of 1.5 per cent GDP growth in 1994.
Will this be enough to reverse the rise in unemployment, which hit a record
12 per cent in October and is forecast to increase further. He hopes so,
noting he has already boosted the cash flow of French firms by speedier
refunds of Value Added Tax and by introducing tax incentives for
apprenticeships and training.
For Mr Balladur, there are no quick fixes for unemployment. Indeed, he
stresses that only through painstaking reform over several years can France
combat its structural labour market problems - difficulties his country
shares with most in western Europe.
He says the Delors white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment,
endorsed in Brussels this month, is only the start of a great debate. 'We
all - French, Germans, British, everyone in western Europe - have a big
problem: how can we maintain what we have achieved politically, socially,
even morally, in an increasingly competitive world? We . . . have built up
systems of social protection which are very necessary, but also very
costly.'
Where the French prime minister is weaker is in showing how France might
take a lead in tackling this problem. He rejects scrapping the country's
generous minimum wage, sometimes criticised for pricing less-skilled workers
out of jobs. To do so 'would be taken as a signal of social durete
(toughness), and I am not at all sure it would advance economic efficiency,'
he says, 'so I won't do it.'
This is typical of the social caution that marks his Gaullist RPR party out
from Anglo-Saxon conservatives. The same goes for his decision in October to
back down in the Air France strike. It leaves the prime minister with an
awkward precedent when he comes to rationalising other loss-making state
enterprises. But he remains unrepentant.
His retreat, he says, was motivated not - as is sometimes said - by the
memory of being Prime Minister Pompidou's industrial relations adviser
during the upheavals of May 1968 but by the fear of social fragility
resulting from unemployment, now at 3.24m.
'Each people has a certain mentality. We in France are very attached to the
principle of justice, and in the case of Air France, lower-paid staff were
being asked to bear more of the cuts (in bonuses). So I decided it was not
worth persevering . . . And if I had to do it again, I would do exactly the
same thing.'
There is almost certainly another reason why Mr Balladur defused the Air
France confrontation. It came as the controversy over the Gatt trade talks
was reaching its height. One crisis at a time was enough.
When he discusses Gatt, Mr Balladur becomes jubilant - and with good reason.
There was a danger that French opposition - notably French farmers - would
sink the Uruguay Round. And although Mr Balladur insists he was always
prepared to strike a deal on the right terms, his task was scarcely made
easier by the way his RPR had fought the parliamentary election on a
platform hostile to the understanding reached between the EU and US on
agriculture.
Mr Balladur's achievement was to turn these difficulties into a bargaining
chip.
When he arrived at the Matignon in April, he says he had two aims. One was
to prevent French farmers being made the culprits: from early on his
negotiating stance embraced a range of issues beyond agriculture, from the
defence of French culture to the overarching rules of world trade. The
second was to take the ideological heat out of the whole debate and get down
to technical nuts and bolts.
By doing this, and through personal diplomacy, he struck up some useful
alliances within Europe - and, he implies, stiffened the EU's resolve. He
acknowledges help from Germany's Chancellor Kohl, the Belgian presidency of
the EU, Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU negotiator ('a very intelligent and
capable man'), and even the UK 'where some leaders supported our demands for
a new world trade organisation'.
His tough tactics may have won him more concessions than he expected -
though he refuses to admit the point: 'If I told you today that I obtained
more than I thought, I would be a very bad negotiator, because in the next
negotiation I would be given fewer concessions]'
Mr Balladur may yet be seen as the man who helped integrate France into the
world economy. 'I expect - but I could be wrong - that the French will see
that it is better to have a good Gatt accord than not to have a Gatt
agreement,' he says. He also hopes the EU will draw the right lesson: 'The
important thing is to know what you want. We showed that we're stronger
together than if we were alone.'
No less, the prime minister must be hoping his Gatt gamble will bear
favourably on his own political fortunes. For in pulling off an acceptable
deal, he has stolen the thunder of France's more protectionist politicians,
one of whom - Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR - happens to see himself
as a prime contender for the presidency. Praise for the agreement has come
from all sides, including Mr Chirac.
But what of Mr Balladur's ambitions to become president when Mr Mitterrand's
term expires in May 1995? He throws up his arms in unusual animation and
says: 'I'm not talking about that. I have never talked about it, and I won't
talk about it for the whole of 1994. And I hope that others will not speak
about it either.'
The trouble is that 'others' already have. Mr Francois Leotard, the defence
minister, and Mrs Simone Veil, both of the centre-right UDF which is in
coalition with Mr Balladur's RPR, have said this month that they think Mr
Balladur would make a fine president.
Mr Chirac will not be easily displaced from his control of the RPR. But
party workers read the opinion polls, and these put Mr Balladur ahead of any
other presidential candidate, even Mr Jacques Delors, the other undeclared
runner who shows up as the Socialists' best hope.
His growing support within the UDF also gives Mr Balladur something no other
RPR politician has - the potential to bring the two parties together into
the sort of conservative movement almost all other European countries have.
This is one ambition Mr Balladur does not shy away from. 'That is what I was
preaching back in 1988,' he says.

Hopes for a brighter year ahead in the Middle East rest critically on
substantial and rapid progress being made in the peace negotiations between
Israel and the Palestinians. With one deadline already missed, and this
week's talks having failed to make progress, there is growing cause for
concern. If they become deadlocked or collapse, the outlook for the region
would appear uniformly grey.
Last September's celebrations over the handshake between Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, has quickly
given way to a more sober assessment of what still has to be achieved, and
the wide differences that separate the two sides. These differences are in
turn exacerbated by the domestic political difficulties faced by both
leaders.
Mr Rabin must constantly balance negotiating concessions against the
pressures threatening to undermine his coalition government, while the
manoeuvrings of the mercurial Mr Arafat reflect, as ever, his paramount
desire to maintain ultimate control of the PLO. For Mr Rabin, this appears
to mean not conceding anything that might appear to threaten Israel's
security, or lead to the eventual emergence of an independent Palestinian
state. For Mr Arafat, it means winning symbols of statehood, however minor,
at every stage of the negotiations. The two men continue to need each other,
but only for as long as they are convinced that peace can be achieved on
terms that bolster their political longevity.
Low profile
It is to their credit that they have progressed so far without more active
US involvement, but it would be dangerous for the region if the Clinton
administration decided to maintain its current low profile. The meeting next
month between Mr Clinton and Syria's President Hafez al-Assad must be used
to revive the moribund negotiations between Syria and Israel, which also
hold the key to an eventual peace deal involving Lebanon and Jordan. A
failure to draw Syria back into the process - by Israel acknowledging an
eventual willingness to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights - will
continue to be a check to progress in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
The stakes are higher than the negotiators care to admit. Governments
throughout the Middle East, both sympathetic and hostile to the west, look
increasingly under pressure, and the opposition to them ever more militant.
The fall in the price of oil to its lowest point for five years may have
just about sustainable consequences for Saudi Arabia, but it could push
Algeria closer to political and economic chaos. And while it may be tempting
for the US and others to applaud the additional damage that lower oil prices
are inflicting on Iran's already ill-managed economy, there is little
prospect of it producing a government more sympathetic to the west, a
conclusion scarcely less applicable to Iraq.
More generous
The Egyptian government, which is trying harder than any other third party
to bring about a wider Arab-Israeli agreement, looks able to contain its
Islamic terrorist threat, but not without a serious loss of tourism revenue
and yet deeper official reluctance to introduce necessary economic and
political reforms. Neighbouring Libya has not been persuaded to change its
ways by western sanctions, while Sudan has emerged as one of the main
gathering points for the region's disaffected.
Nothing that Mr Rabin or Mr Arafat can do will instantly change any of those
fundamentals. But by offering more generous compromises and taking greater
political risks in the twilight of their political careers, they can provide
a powerful counterweight to the bleak appeal of the extremists. Nowhere can
this be more important than in the impoverished Gaza Strip, where
substantial sums of western aid are waiting to be used in the battle against
economic hopelessness and its accompanying militancy.
Of course it matters to both sides who controls the crossing points into the
Gaza Strip. But it would be the most lamentable failure of statesmanship to
allow negotiations to founder over such a relatively minor issue, and
simultaneously provide the enemies of compromise with a triumph that would
be trumpeted throughout the Middle East.

FT  31 DEC 93 / A matter of national honour: The arcane world of merit
awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The president of Turkmenistan dispenses prize stallions; the Canadian
government awards elegant snowflake-shaped medals; the Poles have revived
the Order of the White Eagle. In the UK, the Queen presents the Order of the
Bath, Thistle and Garter.
Though the methods vary, the controversy that honours provoke is widespread.
Honours might be rooted in history - but they highlight contemporary
political and social concerns and reveal the changing attitudes of
governments and the governed.
Britain's annual honours, being unveiled today in the Queen's New Year list,
will represent one attempt by John Major, the prime minister, to modernise a
1,000-year-old tradition which for some has lost touch with the realities of
life.
The reforms have two main thrusts. In line with Mr Major's rhetoric of a
classless society, honours based on military and civilian rank are being
phased out. For the first time, the public has been allowed to nominate
candidates, stressing community work.
The changes are unlikely to be radical, however. Only 300 of the 900 awards
reflect voluntary work, compared with the more usual 200. The government has
refused to end the practice of presenting honours for political service, and
has decided not to put the system into the hands of an independent body.
This year's list was compiled by Downing Street civil servants, as always.
Neither does the government have plans to abolish most of the obscure titles
which give the list its mystique - or oddity.
'Making people the Commander of the British Empire when we don't have an
empire any more is not just ridiculous. It's Ruritanian,' says Professor
Stephen Haseler of London Guildhall University, who says the current system
is still too imbued with political patronage and social snobbery to reflect
merit.
But if he looked abroad, he would find similar anomalies. Though the UK is
unusual because it is the Queen who personally confers the awards,
decorations are by no means the preserve of royalty.
France, for example, has procedures almost as convoluted as those of the UK.
Its top decoration is the Legion d'Honneur, originally awarded for bravery
in battle, though recent French governments have presented it to film stars
such as Elizabeth Taylor. The former arts minister, Jack Lang, prompted a
furore last year by awarding the Arts et Lettres literary award to Sylvester
Stallone; the current arts minister, Jacques Toubon, gave it to Elton John
in May.
Royalist Netherlands has partly avoided such contentiousness by almost never
honouring film stars. About 5,500 orders, mostly the Orange-Nassau, are
given annually, in a list that promotes women.
Germany also has an egalitarian model, insisting that half its annual 4,500
Orders of Merit go to 'ordinary citizens' - above all people involved in
nursing or charity work. In addition, about 100 special medals are
distributed every year to sportsmen and women.
But it is the US that provides the greatest contrast between public and
private awards. In spite of its egalitarian ethos, professional awards are
prolific. US presidents, though, have been among the most restrained players
in the honours game. President John F Kennedy established the the highest
civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in its present form in
1963, and on average there have been only nine recipients a year. Lech
Walesa has received one, along with Lady Thatcher and - memorably - Frank
Sinatra.
The American public is free to nominate candidates, though the list is
decided by the president. Paul Nitze, 86, a foreign policy adviser to every
US president except Jimmy Carter in the past 50 years, received the freedom
medal in 1985. 'I suppose it had something to do with my role in arms
control,' says America's best-known arms controller, who admits that he
wears it 'from time to time'.
Soviet leaders have been less restrained. Leonid Brezhnev not only loved
receiving medals but handed out thousands of titles, such as the Lenin Prize
and Hero of Socialist Labour. 'They showed you on television. It was an
important recognition of genuine labour,' says Valentin Vdovin, a former
Russian diplomat, who received a clutch of medals which he washed, according
to tradition, in vodka.
The collapse of the Soviet Union has brought chaos to the honours system.
Although the Russian government has replaced the Hero of the Soviet Union
with the Hero of Russia, and reinstated the Russian equivalent of the Nobel
prize, most honours have vanished.
Poland has also abolished its communist medals - the Builder of the Polish
People's Republic, and Banner of Work, which were colloquially known as
'bread' orders, because of the privileges they provided. However, President
Walesa has reinstated the prewar Order of the White Eagle - and presented it
to the Pope and to Czech President Vaclav Havel.
Political change has also touched the British Commonwealth. Australia's
citizens now receive the Order of Australia, created in 1975. The list is
drawn up by an independent committee, although it is still rubber-stamped by
the Queen. The Australian George Ivan-Smith, a former UN diplomat, whose
exploits include being kidnapped in the Congo in the 1960s, says he was
delighted to receive the Order. 'What I liked best was that they had
recognised international service,' he says.
Canada has made similar changes, and discourages citizens from accepting
honours conferred by foreign governments. To avoid linguistic wrangles, its
own snowflake-shaped medals are tactfully inscribed in Latin, instead of
French or English.
There is not much opportunity to wear medals in casual Canada, admits Mr
Fredrik Eaton, Canadian High Commissioner in London, an Officer of the Order
of Canada. However, he often sports his gong in London - even though it is
sometimes mistaken for membership of the Rotary Club.
Mr Eaton does not think Canadian practice could replace the UK's
time-honoured traditions. 'I don't think there is much Britain can learn
from Canada - we learnt it from you,' he says. And though some Britons might
blush at the imperial past enshrined in their medals, the honours list shows
no signs of losing its popularity.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Why Edouard Balladur
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A scientific choice it is not. For publications that by tradition nominate a
person of the year, the choice has always been an artificial and subjective
business. There are times when it is unchallengeable: the two occasions in
the 1980s, for example, when we settled on Mikhail Gorbachev; or 1990 -
German unification year - when it was Chancellor Helmut Kohl. There are
years of such unrelieved mediocrity that the decision goes to a
controversial success story: witness 1992 and Deng Xiaoping. There are years
where the hallmark is success and failure combined, sometimes in the same
individual. Nineteen ninety-three has been one such.
What is a person of the year anyway? To our mind, not a saint or a hero; not
even a person whose actions are to be unequivocally approved. Our choices
have tended to be individuals who have not only loomed large in the news,
but who have succeeded in making a tangible, interesting and broadly
positive impact on their country, their business or the wider world. They
have been people who, we hope, say something about the big issues of the
year.
In 1993, a number of candidates might have fitted that rather woolly bill.
The peacemakers were the most obvious - Mandela and De Klerk in South Africa
and Rabin and Arafat in the Middle East, although significant questions
still surround the peace process in both regions. News maker of the year was
Boris Yeltsin, but far from freeing himself of political troubles during
1993, the Russian president faces an ever-deepening sea of them.
Awful start
Of western leaders, President Bill Clinton would have been a worthy choice.
In the second half of the year, he has notched up impressive legislative
successes from the budget to trade, and launched ambitious social reforms -
but his foreign policy performance has been patchy and he had an awful
start. Then there is Fed chairman Alan Greenspan. By keeping interest rates
low, he has presided over an increasingly robust economic recovery without
appreciable inflation - as well as helping to nurse the US banking sector
back to health. But Mr Greenspan has yet to face his real tests: the
agonising decision over whether, and when, to raise rates, and a battle with
Congress over Fed independence.
In business there was Rupert Murdoch. After bouncing back from his financial
troubles, he has spent the year doing what many businessmen have not:
expanding all over the world, and exploring new frontiers in the converging
world of multi-media. But it is not yet clear that either the multi-media
future, or his part in it, is going to be quite what he would have us all
believe.
Trade talks
The outstanding success of 1993 was conclusion of the Gatt world trade
talks, and it had many parents, including trade negotiators Mickey Kantor
and Sir Leon Brittan, and Gatt chief Peter Sutherland. Any or all of these
could have been our persons, but ultimately the negotiators' efforts stood
or fell on their backing from political masters.
Which brings us to our choice. The case for choosing Edouard Balladur is
that he has pulled off a remarkable act of damage limitation in 1993.
When he came to office, France was pursuing an unsustainable mix of fiscal
and monetary policies, in a deepening recession, and in danger of succumbing
to an ugly mood of isolationism. Since then, the economic policy mix has
ignited a currency crisis, and the recession has shown only faint signs of
easing. But Mr Balladur has sailed through it all, refusing to promise
short-term fixes and keeping his eye firmly clamped on the main prize of a
Gatt agreement that could be presented as acceptable to France. What is
more, he has managed to boost his personal popularity in the process, which
is more than can be said for most western leaders.
Of course, he still has a vast amount to prove. If he fails to produce an
economic recovery and a fall in unemployment in 1994, then this choice will
seem odd. But if he shows signs of succeeding by the relatively modest goals
he has set himself, then this cautious moderniser will be well-placed to
become a reforming president of France.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Questions that dog President Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MILTON J EZRATI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Thank you for Jurek Martin's article on President Clinton, 'He Must
Have Got Something Right' (December 29). Often a foreign perspective brings
a clarity that your own nationals have trouble delivering. But as an
American voter, I think I can offer an answer to a question implicit in Mr
Martin's piece. Despite President Clinton's rather impressive record in
getting bills through Congress, Americans still question his abilities on at
least three grounds.
First, there is a suspicion that in order to pass important, highly visible
legislation, particularly the budget, he has promised an inordinate number
of special benefits to individual districts and interest groups. This sort
of trading is common enough. However, the near panic with which Mr Clinton
has used the phone from time to time worries some that the budget and other
legislation has cost the nation a great deal and that the full expense in
favours, will not become apparent for some time.
Second, there is a sense that the North American Free Trade Agreement was
less a success than it might have been. To many observers, Mr Clinton seemed
to let the bill's ample momentum die and then scramble at the last minute to
get the necessary votes. People are as critical of the initial neglect as
they are impressed with the final passage. As it is, there were more votes
than the White House led the public to believe. Some critics go so far as to
suggest that it was all a cynical display to make the treaty look more like
his than in fact it was.
Third, with his party comfortably in the majority in both houses, critics
argue that he ought to find it easy to get legislation through Congress. To
them, his resorting to tremendous efforts could signify a lack of
leadership.
As Mr Martin suggests, the public is hopeful. It is anxious to discard its
reservations about the president. But for the time being, a large part of
the public is not yet ready to have full confidence in him. Milton J Ezrati,

FT  31 DEC 93 / Resounding thud as reputations tumble: FT writers nominate
the world's biggest flops in a year reverberating with the sound of breaking
political moulds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a year can be summed up - metaphorically speaking - in a noise, then 1993
will probably be remembered as echoing with cracks and thuds. The cracks
were the sound of political moulds breaking across the western world. The
thuds were the consequence, as figures and institutions long thought
impregnable fell from their pedestals.
It was a year of flops, but not just any sort of flops: these were downfalls
on a spectacular, in some cases one might say heroic, scale.
Take Japan's Kiichi Miyazawa, for example, the last in an unbroken 38-year
line of prime ministers from the Liberal Democratic party. Two years ago,
Miyazawa was viewed as the thinking person's LDP faction head, a relative
liberal in a party leaning to the right, and possibly the man who would
change the hitherto unchangeable Japanese political system. In the end, his
role was that of frail leader, overwhelmed by the wider forces conspiring to
overturn the old order.
An enduring image of the former prime minister in Japanese minds is his
embarrassed silences when he was questioned about political scandals
implicating the LDP officials who had given him his turn at the top.
He was humiliated when a rebel faction in the LDP brought down the
government by supporting a parliamentary no-confidence motion. His fall was
completed in July, when the LDP lost its majority in a general election and
Miyazawa resigned from the party leadership.
Nowhere were the cracks and thuds more resounding than in Italy, where an
ever spreading web of corruption scandals brought down the political system
of four decades and, with it, many of the country's leading politicians.
The pre-eminent exemplars were Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, and
Giulio Andreotti, the perennial Christian Democrat fixture in government.
Throughout the 1980s and until 1992, they were the most powerful political
duo in Italy. This year both have been been toppled.
The first to be investigated for corruption was 59-year-old Craxi. Accused
of receiving illicit funds, he was forced to step down as Socialist leader
in February. It was not until April that the magistrates caught up with
73-year-old Andreotti, seven times prime minister. He now faces both
corruption charges and the more serious accusation of links with the mafia.
Whatever else happens in the unpredictable world of Italian politics, it is
unlikely that Craxi and Andreotti will enjoy power, or its fruits, again.
That is not necessarily true of Russia's discredited and incriminated
politicians. Ruslan Khasbulatov and Alexander Rutskoi, formerly speaker of
the Supreme Soviet and vice-president, were the ring-leaders of the abortive
Moscow uprising in October. They will be 'celebrating' new year and the
Russian Christmas in Lefortovo prison. As they do so, they may find just a
little consolation in the results of this month's Russian parliamentary
elections.
They pitted themselves against President Boris Yeltsin, believing that the
people would be with them. The parliamentary results show that they had some
reason for thinking so: the kind of policies they espoused were those of the
far right and left parties which, together, will make the largest bloc in
the new parliament.
The full story of their attempted coup and its suppression has not been
told. It may never be, and they may wait as long for a trial as the alleged
coup plotters against Mikhail Gorbachev have waited for theirs. Therein lies
another reason for a little cheer in the dungeons: three of these plotters
were elected to the new parliament and will return to active political life.
Never say never again is the best motto in the new Russia.
The opposite is probably the case for Canada's Kim Campbell, living proof of
the maxim that six months is a long time in politics. Acclaimed in June as
the glamorous new leader of the Progressive Conservative party and the
country's first woman prime minister, she and her government went down in
October to the most humiliating defeat in Canadian political history. The
Tories emerged from the general election with just two of the 295 seats.
By December, party officials had put pressure on Campbell to step down as
leader. The sharp-tongued Vancouver native summed up her brief and brutal
political career by suggesting a title for the book she plans to write:
What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?
A flop of a less sensational, though still ignominious, kind was Steffen
Heitmann, the man nominated amid great hullabaloo to become the next federal
president of Germany, but who then withdrew. Perhaps the most remarkable
thing about him is the fact he is so unremarkable. He was singled out by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl as the easterner who should become president next
June. But his ill thought-out conservative views and lack of public
relations skills left him prey to the scorn of the media.
He will be remembered for his views on foreigners (no wonder they're
unpopular if they steal the washing from your line); on women (they should
stay home and raise families); and the end of Germany's 'special role' -
somehow suggesting, if not meaning, that the Holocaust might be forgotten.
He will be remembered for little else.
One of 1993's more surprising discomfitures was that of America's Ross
Perot. For the diminutive Texan businessman this was not a vintage year, at
least compared with 1992, when he scored the second highest percentage of
the vote in a presidential election ever by an independent candidate.
His Waterloo was the North American Free Trade Agreement and his televised
Wellington was Al Gore. The vice-president not only exposed him as a
bad-tempered autocrat, which is hardly new, but got him blamed for turning
the debate on Nafta into a victory for President Bill Clinton.
Political obituaries may be premature, because his sort of money can still
buy a lot of publicity and Perot, impervious to criticism, counts on the
blind loyalty of the 2m odd members of his United We Stand America. But the
deeper he gets into conventional politics and policies like Nafta, the less
he is trusted by the public.
It seems the humbling of businessmen dabbling in politics has been a general
trend this year. In France, Bernard Tapie - perma-tanned entrepreneur,
former minister and working-class hero - was mired in a range of scandals
from alleged match-rigging at his Olympique-Marseille football club to
alleged fraud at Testut, one of his few remaining businesses. By year-end,
Tapie faced official investigations over the Testut affair, after the
lifting of his parliamentary immunity, and had been voted 'biggest
disappointment of the year' in Paris-Match magazine's annual poll.
In Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, ousted as prime minister in elections by
arch-enemy Benazir Bhutto, provided further proof that business and politics
do not mix. Sharif, an industrialist from Punjab, Pakistan's richest
province, won praise early in his administration for liberalising the
economy and promoting business interests. But he ran into criticism for
overspending, and his most lasting legacy is a mountain of public debt.
In Nigeria - a country where business and politics almost always mix, with
disastrous results - Chief Ernest Shonekan flopped twice. A leading
businessmen, he was appointed head of a transitional government in December
1992, but made no conspicuous headway with solving the country's problems.
After General Ibrahim Babangida, the military leader, reluctantly stepped
down in August, he was made head of state and commander in chief, but he
failed to deliver on promises to revive Nigeria's Structural Adjustment
Programme. By the time he was removed in November, the government faced
soaring inflation, mounting debt arrears and a crippling budget deficit.
Even some businessmen who stuck to their last found it a humiliating year.
One such was James D Robinson III. Back in January, the suave 57-year-old
head of American Express staged what seemed a great corporate survival act
by shrugging off a coup attempt by some of the non-executive directors.
Instead of applauding, however, Wall Street blew a giant raspberry. American
Express's shares fell nearly 10 per cent.
Within five days it was all over. Under pressure from shareholders, Robinson
packed his bags. By the summer, American Express's shares were up 60 per
cent.
In Europe, the most spectacular business reversal was suffered by Volvo
chief Pehr Gyllenhammar. A startled Gyllenhammar discovered in December that
the company he thought he was driving towards a merger with France's Renault
was veering out of his control. The man who had been Mr Volvo for 22 years
was forced to resign as chairman by a management and shareholder rebellion.
Instead of capping his career by becoming chairman of Europe's second
largest vehicle producer, 58-year-old PG is left facing 1994 without a
full-time job.

   From Mr RICHARD THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are right ('Local difficulties', December 22) to highlight the
concerns that business leaders have about the fragmentation of local
government into small, single-tier authorities.
It is not just police and fire services, performing strategic functions,
that cannot be effectively or economically provided by a multiplicity of
units.
Trading standards is a strategic service that affects the business community
even more directly. Bills currently before Parliament mean that the eight
trading standards departments in Wales would nearly treble to 21, and the 12
in Scotland would rise to 28.
Such growth in the number of trading standards departments is bound to
increase business complaints about lack of uniformity and to reduce the
resources and expertise available to enforce and advise on a complex mass of
legislation.
Bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry or the British Retail
Consortium have urged the government to minimise the burdens on business
caused by fragmented regulatory enforcement.
Trading standards is a strategic service which statute should ensure is
provided by large units.

Sir, Martin Easteal writes (Letters, December 29) of the Local Government
Commission's support for the two-tier system in rural areas. He also writes
of the systematic and objective opinion research undertaken by the
commission, that the commission takes into account people's expressed
preferences, and that local government needs sufficient resilience to
inherit functions now administered by quangos.
How odd, therefore, that he should write this letter in the same week that
the commission recommended scrapping the two-tier system in Somerset, one of
England's most rural shires. How curious that the recommendation should go
against the clear preferences of local people and those of most of the key
organisations - economic, social and cultural - directly concerned with
local government services. Does he really suppose that a rural unitary
council serving a population of 125,000 would be an attractive agency for
the next central government initiative, such as community care?
Improving the two-tier system for rural communities would be a far more
acceptable use of local authority resources over the next two years than the
costly, disruptive reorganisation which we now face.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Economic model accuracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor DOUGLAS MCWILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Kenneth Wallis is quite right to point out (Letters, December
23) that the full effects of tax changes, once multiplier effects are taken
into account, are even greater than the first round effects on consumers'
expenditure. But he is wrong to conclude that this vindicates conventional
models of the economy from the criticism I have made about the way in which
they incorporate taxation.
Indeed, the existence of multiplier effects increases the importance of
accurately estimating the 'first round' impact of tax changes on consumers'
expenditure. The study carried out by the CEBR to which Professor Wallis
refers points out that conventional models such as those used by the
Treasury and Bank of England typically understate first round effects by
half.

Sir, There are omissions in Simon Ellis's article on business broadcasting
(Management, December 22). First, he omits to mention our programme Dawn
Traders, broadcast between 5.30am-6.00 am, with a loyal City following
thanks to its provision of tightly focused city and market news and
information.
Second, he omits our finance and business summary in our Drivetime programme
which is both earlier and longer than the Financial World Tonight on Radio
4. Containing a market report from Wall Street, as well as news coverage of
the day's business events and at least one, and often up to three
interviews, it is also more comprehensive than the Financial World Tonight.
Both these programme segments broadcast interviews with a wide range of
interviewees from City economists to chairmen, financial directors and union

FT  31 DEC 93 / Letter From Berlin: Together again underground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Snow was falling fast, but Mrs Erike Bruhn hardly cared as she entered
Pankow U-bahn (underground) station. 'If I had to change trains on the
U-bahn, as I did before, you would not find me in a good humour,' she said,
tucking her silver grey hair under her woollen hat.
Mrs Bruhn lives in Prenzlauer Berg, east Berlin, the heart of east Germany's
avant-garde and intellectual life before the Berlin Wall fell in November
1989.
Above the gentle hum of the orange-coloured train, Mrs Bruhn said she did
not believe the city was truly united until a few weeks ago: 'Every time I
wanted to visit my friends in the western part of the city, I had to keep
changing trains. I am 70 years old, so I don't like going up and down all
those stairs.'
The holiday season has brought a particular delight for Mrs Bruhn - and
other inhabitants of Berlin. For the first time since 1961, the two parts of
the city's main underground line have been reconnected beneath the heart of
the Mitte, the centre of prewar Berlin.
The U2 now runs west from Ruhleben, near the former Olympic Stadium in west
Berlin, cuts through Potsdamer Platz, for decades part of the 'death-strip'
that flanked the Berlin Wall, to end in Pankow, in the north of east Berlin.
'I really feel, now that the old stations have been opened, we Berliners are
at long last united,' said Mrs Bruhn.
Until 1961, Berliners used the line to cross the city, though their
movements were restricted by regulations imposed by the four allied powers,
particularly the Russians who controlled the eastern sector.
'The line linked Kurfurstendamm, the fashionable shopping district and its
smart coffee houses, with the old, historic heart of east Berlin,' said Mr
Wolfgang Gobel, spokesman for Berlin's public transport department.
'You could do your shopping, get off at Potsdamer Platz, walk over to the
Brandenburg Gate, and still manage to stroll down Unter den Linden'  - one
of Germany's finest streets until the second world war.
But once the Wall was built, the underground stations which had run through
the centre of Berlin were closed off by east Germany's communists. Its
border guards, in knee-high black leather boots, patrolled the desolate,
damp and rat-infested stations, to ensure no easterner used the underground
as an escape route. Few ever did.
'It is my first time on the line for over 33 years. To tell you the truth,
it's wonderful and it's so good for the city's morale. It feels like one
city,' said Mr Reinhard Schulze, a mechanical engineer. Mr Schulze and his
friend, Mr Andreas Fieberger, had just travelled the length of the line,
east to west, from Pankow to Ruhleben. Both work for a small machine-tool
manufacturer located in west Berlin.
More than 380,200 people commute from the eastern to the west German states
 -120,000 coming from east Berlin. 'There is no doubt that linking the two
parts of U2 has economic and psychological consequences,' said Mr Gobel.
'It's not only good for the commuters; there's more of an incentive for west
Berliners, who for many reasons have been slow to see the other part of
Berlin, the museums, to see how easterners live, simply to explore their own
city.'
Such sentiments, however, sometimes fall on deaf ears in the west of the
city. 'Why should I bother to go over to east Berlin? There's nothing to
see,' said Heinz, a 53-year-old engineer, travelling on the western part of
the line. 'I've never been over there.'
But he appeared to be in a minority. Most Berliners, appear uncommonly
enthusiastic. Ms Helga Wetten, a vintner, said: 'The existence of the Wall
forced the administrations of both cities to prove each side was better than
the other. We don't have to prove anything any more. The U2 is at last
making us slowly become a normal city again.'

FT  31 DEC 93 / Arts: Hard times for innovative productions - Opera in 1993
/ Although lack of money has meant a rash of revivals of old favourites,
there have also been some truly bold achievements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT

<TEXT>
The high point of 1993 came almost at the year's end. The way it came
provided a handful of topical insights, not altogether cheering, into the
direction opera in Britain now seems headed. For one 'public preview' and
three concert performances, the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, in
company with a choice cast containing several British debutants, assembled
on the Barbican Hall platform for a once-in-a-lifetime account of Berlioz's
Trojans.
At the time of writing this, days after the final of the three (the one I
attended), I feel myself still utterly rapt in recollection of an awesome
experience - and, what is more, I keep bumping into 'ordinary' members of
the public anxious to relate a similarly durable sense of thrall. The
presence on the podium of Colin Davis, the LSO's chief conductor-in-waiting,
was all-important: this performance was the fruit of a lifetime's
championing of the composer in general and his magnum opus in particular.
The conductor's tender encouragement of the three leading newcomers to their
roles - the dramatic mezzos Jane Henschel (Cassandra) and Markella Hatziano
(Dido) and the tenor Vladimir Bogachov (Aeneas), all nobly responsive -
could be felt at every moment. The long span, tensile strengths and
imaginative potency of Berlioz's five mighty acts were drawn on, and out, in
myriad incalculable ways, fostering a more complete Trojans 'production'
than any I had previously seen or heard.
This was a concert performance to raise again the old question, do we really
need anything more? In other words, do we really need the machinery,
trappings and brouhaha of an opera house? The extraordinary thing is that
the LSO Trojans launched a tripartite December festival of concert-opera in
London - a matter of pure coincidence, really - all three parts of which
maintained similar high standards and raised similar questions.
At the Albert Hall, the Royal Philharmonic and a galaxy of star singers
(including the marvellously opulent-voiced soprano Galina Gorchakova) from
the Kirov Opera under the St Petersburg chief, Valery Gergiev, seem to have
done wonders for Tchaikovsky's underrated last opera, Iolanta. At the Queen
Elizabeth Hall Monteverdi's Coronation of Poppaea, given twice by John Eliot
Gardiner and his trusty 'period' cohorts, was minimally staged, with singers
(Sylvia McNair, Anne Sofie von Otter, Michael Chance and the Italian bass
Francesco Ellero d'Artegna) schooled to tap a high voltage of dramatic
energy from the text. For me the opera was never more gravely beautiful, nor
more terrifyingly pitiless in its view of human affections and ambitions.
So, at a time when our national opera companies face the immediate prospect
of painful shortfalls in their sources of public funding, is concert-hall
opera an art-form worth cultivating? Can such a thing perhaps be relied
upon, even encouraged, to 'make up the difference' in the money-starved
future? (The LSO has a Davis Idomeneo already planned, the RPO-Kirov
combination an enticing Rimsky-Korsakov rarity, and the Gardiner-English
Baroque Soloists' Mozart series is still in action. In addition, such London
bodies as Opera In Concert have their next offering lined up for March, a
Royal Festival Hall Ernani with the Russian soprano Maria Guleghina.)
The answer is, of course we need the 'real thing' more than the concert
substitute. It only requires a memory-nudge back to another Barbican-LSO
opera-concert, much earlier in 1993 - Peter Grimes, all but reduced to
musical and dramatic blether by the insufficiently prepared (to put it
euphemistically) Britten conductor, Mstislav Rostropovich - to point up the
countervailing argument. That is: opera-concerts not mounted with the
highest degree of preparatory zeal can prove a far more inadequate
realisation of the operatic experience than the most ordinary opera-house
revival.
Likewise, Glyndebourne's occupation of the Festival Hall. This was the year
without the Sussex festival proper, the year given over to the building of
the new Glyndebourne Theatre (due for opening next May). Two of the three
Glyndebourne-LPO concert performances put on in London as makeweights,
Beatrice and Benedict and Fidelio, were sad disappointments, showing little
evidence of that fine-fingered, lengthily-brewed ensemble interplay for
which Glyndebourne performances are renowned. (I missed the third, The Merry
Widow, which my colleague David Murray enjoyed rather more than I had the
preceding Berlioz and Beethoven.)
In any Grand Opera staging, the larger the scenographic requirements - and
Berlioz's for The Trojans bulk among the largest in all opera - the more
probable it is that the theatrical dimension will in the end compromise the
musical. That is still no excuse for our theatres to shirk tackling the
biggies of lyric theatre. In spite of all I said earlier about this latest
Davis Trojans, I still pray that we may have him back at Covent Garden one
day, at the head of a brand-new Trojans production.
But that needs money, of course. While the fortuitously-arranged London
concert-opera festival was unfolding, and indeed during the time of the
Kirov Iolanta, it was painful to recall that Covent Garden was being forced
to put on its umpteenth Tosca revival with principals - Sergey Leiferkus and
Anna Tomowa-Sintow - who, but for the philistine strictures of the Arts
Council's Warnock Report, should have been gracing a revival of the Royal
Opera's marvellous 1990 Prince Igor. The gloomy fact that, for the
foreseeable future, the house will have to avoid the 'risk' provided by such
elevating challenges as the Borodin epic - or indeed, the War and Peace that
the company shares with the St Petersburg house but now cannot afford to
bring to London - should put the satisfactions provided by even the best
kind of concert-opera in the proper perspective.
It was not, in sum, an annus mirabilis for opera in Britain. While good
things were encountered during its course, and much that was better than
good, a general awareness prevailed that the main companies were only just
managing to keep their heads above water. Long runs of Figaro, Barber, Magic
Flute, Mikado, Tosca and such-like became the rule. Design costs were cut to
the bone - often a stimulus to dramatic ingenuity (as in Opera North's
admirable new Don Carlos and superlatively fine Wozzeck), sometimes (as in
the Royal Opera's new Onegin and borrowed-from-Scotland new Flute and
English National Opera's new Lohengrin) a distinct, all-too-visible
handicap. The effect of rehearsal schedules pared down for money-saving
reasons could be felt on more than one first night.
Hard times. It is necessary to report them with an unflinching gaze; but
this year I prefer, instead of a case-by-case survey of all our companies,
to record more summarily the occasions on which, in spite of handicaps, the
positive outweighed the negative. At the Royal Opera this meant, inter alia,
the new Stiffelio - little-known Verdi mounted with love and understanding
under Edward Downes's wise Verdian baton, not vocally ideal (Jose Carreras,
Catherine Malfitano and Gregory Yurisch the leads) but illuminated by rare
commitment.
The shoestring Onegin was lifted to glory by the presence of those
already-mentioned Kirov stars, Gergiev as conductor and Gorchakova,
Leiferkus and the tenor Gegam Grigorian. The resonant Russian accent and
full-bodied delivery of the score made up for the exiguous quality of the
staging. Earlier in the year, Colin Davis had indeed conducted Berlioz in
the house - a borrowed staging (by Harry Kupfer) of La Damnation de Faust
which I found endlessly enthralling and others simply loathed. Die
Meistersinger returned, in a first-ever Graham Vick production conducted,
also for the first time, by Bernard Haitink. Though it gave me less
bounteous satisfaction than many of my colleagues, there was a salient
freshness of style about the show that was summed up in the brilliant
first-time Beckmesser of Thomas Allen.
In June the ENO ruling triumvirate of Mark Elder (conductor), David Pountney
(producer) and Peter Jonas (general administrator) duly retired. The
overview of their achievements will take a while to gain final clarity;
already we are aware - because he came back in November to impress us all
with a superbly mature, long-breathed account of the new Lohengrin - how
considerable was Elder's contribution to those achievements. Likewise, the
question whether and how the new team of Sian Edwards (conductor) and Dennis
Marks (administrator) are settling in is not to be answered by reference to
the offerings of their first few months - above all not, I should like to
hope, by the evidence of the house's comprehensively disappointing new
Boheme, of which Edwards offered a worryingly coarse musical traversal.
Since the ENO's 1980s team made its reputation via a 'house style' -
interventionist, image-conscious - now supposedly outdated in the less
carefree 1990s, it gives me particular pleasure to recall as one of the
highlights of the year the company's David Alden production of Handel's
Ariodante, a typical dream-world re-thinking that for all its 'radical'
excesses created a vital, individual new form of Handelian opera-theatre.
The excellence of conductor (Nicholas McGegan) and cast (led by Ann Murray
and Amanda Roocroft) must not go unremembered.
Elder's last new ENO production was of Jonathan Harvey's Inquest of Love,
which in defiance of an unhelpful staging by David Pountney came across as
the most substantial premiere offered at the Coliseum in a long while (this
is, unfortunately, less of a compliment than it sounds, given the recent ENO
record with regard to new opera).
Opera North's farewell to the years of Nicholas Payne's administration was a
bumper package of daring ideas cunningly carried out: Don Carlos, La
Gioconda and by and large the tautest, sharpest Wozzeck I have seen - a
notable debut in opera by the theatre director Deborah Warner - were three
of the year's boldest achievements. To do Gioconda, an Italian Grand Opera
warhorse, on small-house means and succeed with it at all, let alone
proudly, takes an admirable combination of knowhow, foresight and plain
daring.
I failed to visit Scottish Opera this year; my visits to Welsh National
brought mixed pleasures, among them a Tristan und Isolde made deeply
eloquent more by Jeffrey Lawton and Anne Evans in the title roles than by
Charles Mackerras's energetic conducting (the staging was feeble). But I was
sorry that a period of autumn illness caused me to miss the company's
highly-praised Massenet Cendrillon: please Mr Epstein, bring it back]
In the domain of new opera, and in addition to the Harvey Inquest, I was
specially grateful for the British premiere of Siegfried Matthus's Cornet
Rilke's Song of Love and Death, a long-overdue first British production of
any opera by this former East German composer. Short, beautifully made,
cunningly devised to function as opera, dream-vision and poetic metaphor all
at one go, Cornet Rilke proved the highlight of a generally classy autumn
season by Glyndebourne Touring Opera.
Prior to its opening, this most valuable of British touring companies had
been placed under notice of death sentence by the Arts Council of Great
Britain. At the time, passionate protest was aroused, as it should be, by
the sheer folly of such a decision; but since then, worries over the future
of GTO have tended to be obscured by the brouhaha aroused by the Arts
Council's 'beauty contest' method of deciding the future funding of three of
the four independent London orchestras. Now that this ludicrous piece of
judicial irresponsibility has ended in the shambles it so richly deserved,
and abuse is being heaped on the council from all sides, those GTO worries
seem to have been forgotten.
At the moment the Arts Council itself seems headed either for extinction or
else for a well-merited overhaul: but will Glyndebourne Touring Opera be
dragged down with this particular sinking ship?

<TEXT>
The last night of the year has become one of the prime moments for avoiding
television if you can, but today, if you pick your way through the
schedules, you should be able to avoid all that ghastly false merriment.
Starting at 7.55pm BBC2 offers a performance of La Traviata recorded in La
Fenice, Venice, one of the most charming opera houses in Italy, though
small. Coloratura soprano Edita Gruberova sings Violetta, the doomed
courtesan, tenor Neil Shicoff is Alfredo, and baritone Giorgio Germont takes
the part of his namesake Giorgio. Direction for television is by Derek
Bailey, one of the best in the world, with staging and design by Pier Luigi
Pizzi, and the orchestra and chorus of the Fenice is under Carlo Rizzi. A
treat.
When that ends at 10.05pm Channel 4 will be just 15 minutes into its New
Year's Eve Triple Whammy which manages to celebrate the new year three times
by stationing cameras in Cape Town (new year at 10pm GMT) Prague (11pm) and
Dublin (midnight). With luck this should avoid all traces of heather and fat
men reading gags off autocue.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Management: Why Shakespeare was wrong about names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
William Shakespeare was only half right when he wrote Juliet's famous
declaration of love for Romeo: 'What's in a name? That which we call a rose,
by any other name would smell as sweet.'
He was right in that people's names seldom matter much - although one
wonders if a well-bred modern Juliet would fall as easily for a Wayne. But
in most other senses he was wrong. The names of most objects - including
flowers - have distinct meanings, or develop them over time. Would Juliet
have felt as enraptured by an equally sweet-smelling blossom called, say,
stinkwort?
Shakespeare's half-bloomer has come to mind repeatedly over the past few
weeks as I have inspected a steady flow of readers' replies to my appeal for
a more stylish name for that fashionable but misleading concept, the
'horizontal organisation'.
For those who missed the column which sparked the correspondence (Nov 5), a
short word of explanation is required. My complaint was partly that the idea
of horizontal, hierarchy-less organisations has been extolled for years by
academics and consultants, without anyone being precise about what it means.
I also inveighed against the misleading - or, at least, over-optimistic -
way in which some people are now starting to slap the term onto actual
companies, such as Motorola, Texas Instruments and AT&amp;T.
It is true that, through process re-engineering and other measures, various
units within these organisations are being redesigned with relatively flat
hierarchies. This changes, to some extent, their lines of responsibility and
communication. Traditionally, these were vertical: they ran up and down
particular departments, or 'functions', as they are often known in
management-speak. Instead, to a considerable degree - but not entirely -
they now run laterally across former departmental boundaries.
But this does not make such organisations horizontal, in the complete sense
of the word, any more than Wayne is identical with Romeo, or stinkwort with
rose. Almost all of them retain some degree of hierarchy and functional
structure. It would be accurate to describe them as 'mixed', 'hybrid',
'differentiated' or perhaps 'process-managed'.
Accurate, but both vague and awful. Hence my appeal for sensible but stylish
improvements.
Some of my correspondents had a field day. One humorous fellow was too smart
by half: he suggested 'legless', on the grounds that it conveyed not only
the sense of 'elimbinated' (sic) organisational legs (departments), but also
the horizontal state of consultants who have no leg to stand on. Get it? He
also suggested 'disvertical'. Does he call that stylish? He did rather
better with 'the Barnet organisation', as in the English soccer team of that
name. As he said, 'there's no flatter team in the Football League than
Barnet FC'
Soccer metaphors also arrived aplenty from the Belgian city of Liege, in the
form of 'football team', 'free-flowing' and 'wave-effect' organisations.
Good tries, but hardly precise or inspiring.
Then there was the partner of one of the world's leading accounting firms,
who proposed 'para-functional', meaning beyond functional. I have news for
him: the term is neither stylish nor clear. In my dictionaries, 'para' is
used to mean 'beside' (as in paramedic) far more often than 'beyond' (as in
paranormal).
A sceptic about the viability of anything resembling a horizontal
organisation came up with 'managerially disadvantaged'. That is certainly
stylish, but not necessarily accurate.
Leaving aside a number of other contributions, the most thoughtful letters
came from a professor of auditing, a management researcher, and a
consultant. The professor got closest to the mark with his suggestion of
'team-driven'.
He argued that 'process-managed' or any other term including the word
'managed', is suggestive of hierarchy, whereas the key characteristic of any
degree of horizontalism is teamwork.
But 'team-driven' does not convey the full sense required. For one thing,
not all teams operate across departments, which is one of the key
characteristics of a horizontal organisation.
The researcher's contribution was a very thoughtful essay on the dangers to
western managers of wavering between opposites: not just horizontal vs
vertical, but also group vs individual, authority vs autonomy, competition
vs collaboration, and so on.
What makes Japanese companies special, he suggested, is their ability to
embrace, even integrate, these opposites, so that elements of them can be
applied as needed. As a frequent exponent of the principle of ambiguity and
paradox in management, I agree with him.
As he argued, it would be folly to advocate that all organisations be either
completely vertical or horizontal: many should be mixed. But, as he also
said, this does not mean that terms such as 'hybrid' are adequate. Apart
from their awkwardness, they are abstract: they beg the question of what
'hybrid' actually consists of.
He ended up in the same camp as the consultant, who argued rightly that
different types of organisation are needed for different purposes:
'horizontal' and flexibly project-based for architects and custom
ship-builders; vertical and highly structured for companies which churn out
thousands of standard jam jars.
The consultant's conclusion was that 'it doesn't matter what it's called -
it's what it does that's important'. That, although a trifle less poetic,
was exactly Shakespeare's misguided point.
As a firm believer in the motivating, often inspirational, power of
language, I still beg to differ with him. I shall continue my name-hunt,
even if it renders me horizontal in the process.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Management: A vision of superhumanity - How do today's
managers see tomorrow? Peter Herriot concludes our series with the view from
the sharp end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER HERRIOT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management gurus have already been free with their predictions for the
management tasks of the next century. The senior executive of the year 2000
will be a composite of the business acumen of Lord Weinstock, the innovative
genius of Bill Gates, and the integrity of the Archangel Gabriel (in no
particular order).
To prepare for this superhuman role, he or she will have rowed across the
Atlantic (twice) and written a seminal text on moral philosophy.
Gurus have pontificated, but we have heard little from those at the sharp
end. What do the people currently doing the job believe the requisite roles
will be? What are their recommendations regarding the most appropriate ways
of developing such skills?
Sundridge Park surveyed 260 CEOs and general managers to find out. They were
asked what the biggest changes in their own business environment were going
to be by the year 2003; what were the role requirements for coping with
these challenges; and how might people best be developed to fill such roles.
The three biggest business changes predicted were these: innovative,
high-quality products and services will be even more essential than they are
at the moment if competitive advantage is to be achieved; there will be much
greater collaboration with customers and with other organisations; and the
business environment will be yet more unpredictable and competitive.
So much for a return to a mythical pre-recessionary steady state.
As for the necessary role requirements in the next century, there was more
than a hint of the Archangel Gabriel syndrome. The strategic manager of 2003
will have to be, above all:
A Truster, who allows others to take risks and lives with their mistakes.
An Ally, who networks and forms alliances.
A Changer, who manages change consultatively.
Although the traditional role of Pointer, who sets and communicates
objectives, was considered important, it did not relate especially closely
to the new business issues.
How are such paragons to be developed? Not surprisingly, to be a Truster one
needs to have been trusted oneself. It is vital that developing strategic
managers are allowed to take risks and responsibility themselves.
It also helps to have done a wide variety of jobs, perhaps because this
reveals the skills and knowledge which others have had to develop to fulfil
their roles.
As for the role of Ally, it is important to have managed one's career so
that both at the corporate level and at the sharp end of a business one has
had real contact with other organisations. Aspirant Allies are also urged to
involve themselves in teams and project work, where they can play, and
become skilled at, a variety of roles.
And the Changers, the movers and shakers - what of them? The important
qualification here is that the Changer does it consultatively. Red meat
eating is therefore not a good preparation. Rather, the skills of persuasion
are required. These are best honed in the context of project teams.
The overall picture is that a considerable increase in interpersonal skills
will be needed.
The strategic manager of 2003 will have to establish and maintain working
relations with a much wider range of people than at present. He or she will
need to understand where people from all levels of their own organisation
are coming from; to appreciate the different assumptions, values and
practices of people from other organisations and sectors; and to get inside
the hearts and minds of different national cultures.
There was, incidentally, a very interesting prediction about organisational
size. Our respondents felt that the numbers of employees overall, and of
managers, would decline.
However, the number of professionals would increase. When we looked at the
financial and professional services sector from among our respondents, they
placed much less importance on the three key role requirements than did
respondents from other sectors.
So the professionals, the only people who are going to become more numerous,
are less likely to value the skills of forming and maintaining relations
with others. They will certainly be a challenge for the remaining general
managers.
Organisations will need to concentrate on helping their people to develop
the appropriate role skills, though much will depend on which business
changes will have the most powerful impact on them.
For some of the methods suggested by our respondents, there are no short
cuts. It is simply not possible to cram varied cross-functional and
cross-national job experience into a year or two.
It is also noteworthy that fast track schemes are losing their popularity -
they hardly encourage the others, and there is no time for the fast-trackers
to learn from the consequences of their mistakes.
On the other hand, some of the recommended developmental techniques have
shorter time horizons. For example, teamworking on projects permits a
variety of roles. It also makes learning from outcomes much more immediate.
Teams can monitor and evaluate their progress during their task. They can
discover and learn from the outcomes after it is over.
One of the most important processes in successful teamworking is managing
the boundaries - keeping sponsors and clients informed and happy. Again,
this is ideal preparation for the role of Ally and for the business
requirement for increased collaboration.
So, viewed from the perspective of the senior executives of today, their
successors will tread an ever-expanding stage, full of a variety of players.
They will not be strutting around as isolated, heroic figures, bearing
visions back down from the burning bush up on the mountain. Rather, they
will have learned from others to understand and utilise diversity.

<TEXT>
JANUARY
A relatively good year for the UK economy starts with a cut in UK base rates
to 6 per cent, to lowest level for 15 years. A big year for resignations and
departures starts with Jurgen Moelleman leaving as German economics
minister; Poul Schluter resigning as Danish PM over Tamil refugees scandal;
Gerald Corrigan, president of Federal Reserve Bank of New York, announcing
plans to resign; James Robinson departing as chairman of American Express;
and John Akers quitting as IBM's chief executive, after Dollars 5bn loss.
Zoe Baird, Bill Clinton's nominee for attorney general, never even makes it
into office. In his last month as president, George Bush orders a series of
missile attacks on Iraq and signs Start 2 arms treaty with Russia. Insider
Eddie George is appointed as new governor of the Bank of England; outsider
Rupert Pennant-Rea moves from editorship of Economist to be deputy governor.
Dirty seas as Liberian oil tanker Braer wrecked off coast of Shetland
Islands. 'Dirty tricks' affair causes British Airways to make apology to
Virgin Atlantic and pay Pounds 610,000 in libel damages. John Major issues
libel writs over magazine allegations about his private life.
FEBRUARY
It ends at last. The final trial of the Guinness affair sees Thomas Ward
acquitted of theft. They pay at last. John Major announces that the Queen
and Prince of Wales are to be liable for tax. Extra tax revenue would be
gratefully received by Bill Clinton who launches a Dollars 500bn deficit
reduction package. More resignations and departures; Brian Mulroney quits as
prime minister of Canada; Lord King steps down early as chairman of British
Airways; Duke of Westminster, one of Britain's wealthiest men, quits
Conservative party over leasehold reform. Italian cabinet ministers resign
and magistrates order arrests of politicians and businessmen as corruption
scandal grows. It rumbles on for the rest of the year. Timex decides to sack
all workers at Dundee plant and replace them with a new labour force; the
decision leads to angry scenes on picket lines. Punxsutawney groundhog sees
shadow. The effects of recession linger in the UK. Headline unemployment
reaches 3m for first time in six years, as ICI announces plans to split in
two and shed 9,000 jobs; and National Westminster bank announces 4,000 job
cuts. A bomb at New York's World Trade Centre kills five.
MARCH
Edouard Balladur becomes French prime minister after elections sweep
socialists from power, one of a series of upsets for incumbent governments
this year. In the UK, Norman Lamont delivers, unbeknownst to him, his last
Budget. He announces many delayed-action tax increases. The most
controversial measure is VAT on fuel, but the City is more upset by the cut
in the tax credit on dividends. The government loses a key vote on
Maastricht bill by 22 votes, prolonging ratification process. But there is
some good news for the Tories: unemployment falls for first time in three
years. Michael Heseltine's coal white paper promises to save 12 of 31
threatened pits and to speed up privatisation. The corporate merry-go-round
whirls on. Peter Rawlins, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange,
resigns after the abandonment of Taurus, the electronic share settlement
system. Ernest Mario, Glaxo's chief executive, is ousted in boardroom coup.
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua quits General Motors to join Volkswagen,
starting long and bitter dispute; Hoover dismisses its European president
and two senior executives after a flawed free flights offer; IBM hires Lou
Gerstner of RJR Nabisco to be its new chief executive. Bomb blasts in Bombay
kill 200.
APRIL
The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development is revealed as the bank
that likes to say yes to itself, especially when it comes to marbled halls
and travel expenses. Another government falls. Giuliano Amato resigns and
Carlo Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, asked to form the country's
52nd post-war administration. But voters express confidence in President
Boris Yeltsin in referendum as G7 countries agree Dollars 43bn aid package
for Russia. Old institutions face up to change. Lloyd's of London announces
radical restructuring plan, including the introduction of corporate capital.
The Guardian agrees to buy the 200-year-old Observer. Philip Morris cuts
price of Marlboro cigarettes and sparks debate about value of brands in
straitened 1990s. Bundesbank cuts discount rate by a quarter, and the
Lombard rate by a half, of a percentage point. Siege of Branch Davidian cult
headquarters in Waco, Texas ends tragically when fire sweeps the compound -
more than 80 cult members die. IRA bomb in Bishopsgate kills one man and
causes massive damage. Thirty Zambians, including 18 members of the national
football team, are killed in an air crash off the coast of Gabon.
MAY
John Major's darkest hour. Substantial losses for Conservatives in county
council elections leaves them in charge of just one shire. Liberal Democrats
win Newbury by-election. Soon afterwards, Major replaces Norman Lamont as
chancellor with Kenneth Clarke. An angry Lamont leaves the cabinet. While
the prospects for the Maastricht treaty improve as Danish voters say Yes in
second referendum, the prospects for European monetary union turn distinctly
worse. Continuing strains in Exchange Rate Mechanism lead to devaluation of
peseta and escudo. As the French government sets out plans for an
independent central bank, the Bank of England is sued by Bank of Credit and
Commerce International depositors for failing in its role as regulator.
Government drops unit fines system, under which offenders paid penalties
according to level of income. Asil Nadir is evidently unimpressed by the
reform as the Polly Peck boss skips bail and flies to northern Cyprus.
Receivers are called in at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside warship builder. Bomb
in Florence kills five and damages Uffizi gallery.
JUNE
Politicians vie for the Howe/Lawson award for the most controversial
resignation speech of the year. Norman Lamont says 'We give the impression
of being in office but not in power.' But, although he damages the
government, the award goes to Michael Mates's speech. His criticism of the
Serious Fraud Office for its handling of Nadir case is continually
interrupted by speaker Betty Boothroyd. Goodbye to Jacques Attali, who
resigns as head of European Bank of Research and Development; hello to
Tansur Ciller, Turkey's first woman prime minister. The US launches missile
attack on Iraqi intelligence HQ in Baghdad. In Nigeria, the military annuls
the result of the presidential election. Invesco MIM is fined Pounds 750,000
by UK investment watchdog Imro; three of the 55 charges relate to Mirror
Group Pension Fund. Goldman Sachs fined Pounds 160,000 by the Securities and
Futures Authority over its dealings with Robert Maxwell. Lloyd's of London
records highest ever loss of Pounds 2.9bn. Robin Leigh-Pemberton, outgoing
Governor of the Bank of England, receives a peerage in Queen's Birthday
honours; Samuel Brittan of the FT is knighted.
JULY
House of Commons finally agrees to ratify the Maastricht treaty, despite the
doubts of Cabinet Euro-sceptics, or 'bastards' in the taped words of John
Major. The ERM continues to totter after Bundesbank's decision to leave
discount rate unchanged disappoints other governments. The unpopularity of
incumbent administrations is revealed once again as Japan's Liberal
Democratic party loses its parliamentary majority after almost 40 years in
power, and Britain's Liberal Democrats win Christchurch by-election from
Tories. 'Ring of steel' (mostly plastic, actually) set up around the City to
counter threat of terrorism. Chokepoints on Cheapside but transport
secretary John MacGregor proposes widening the M25 to 14 lanes in some
places. Royal Commission on Criminal Justice recommends abolition of a
defendant's right to trial by jury. Scientists decide that bones found in
Yekaterinburg were almost certainly those of Tsar Nicholas II and his
family, murdered in 1918. Treasury tells Securities and Investment Board
that commission earned by life insurance salesmen must be revealed to
consumers.
AUGUST
Whatever happened to the silly season? News refuses to take a holiday, as
Israel and PLO reveal they have been conducting secret peace discussions in
Norway; EC finance ministers virtually abandon the ERM, allowing currencies
to float within bands of 15 per cent; President Clinton's budget package
passes Senate by one vote; and Morihiro Hosokawa becomes prime minister of
Japan as head of a seven-party coalition. Although the Bank of England warns
that Britain's inflation record could be threatened by rising government
borrowing, signs of UK economic recovery help the FT-SE 100 index to break
3,000 for the first time. More firsts: ER indoors opens some of Buckingham
Palace's staterooms to the public and Martin Taylor becomes the first ex-FT
journalist to be appointed as chief executive of Barclays. Monopolies and
Mergers Commission recommends that British Gas should lose its monopoly of
gas supply to domestic consumers. Police raid Volkswagen's head office and
the homes of several top executives in search for documents allegedly stolen
from General Motors' subsidiary. US lawyer Robert Altman is acquitted on
BCCI fraud charges.
SEPTEMBER
Signs of hope in the Middle East as Yitzhak Rabin and Yassir Arafat shake
hands and Israel and PLO sign agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule.
But signs of civil war in Russia as Boris Yeltsin imposes direct
presidential rule and calls fresh elections; parliament votes to strip him
of his powers and installs Alexander Rutskoi as his replacement. A
cornucopia of cuts: US vice-president Al Gore's report on eliminating waste
in public expenditure promises Dollars 108bn of savings in five years; the
Bundesbank (a bit late to save the ERM) reduces Lombard and discount rates
by a 1/2 percentage point; and the Times cuts its cover price from 45p to
30p, causing the Independent to attack Rupert Murdoch's paper for 'predatory
pricing'. The public purse opens in Japan, where the government announces a
Y6,150bn economic recovery package; it closes in Britain as Kenneth Clarke
says public sector pay increases will only be allowed if funded by
productivity improvements. Merger mania returns. Viacom makes agreed Dollars
8.2bn bid for Paramount; QVC launches rival, hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid eight
days later. Renault and Volvo agree to merge their automotive operations. U
OCTOBER
Troops loyal to Boris Yeltsin storm Russian parliament; 170 people are
killed. A dreadful month in Ulster as IRA bomb kills 10 in Shankill fish
shop and Loyalist gunmen murder seven at Greysteel. Another electoral upset.
Liberals win landslide victory in Canadian election; outgoing Progressive
Conservatives reduced to just two seats. Benazir Bhutto returns as
Pakistan's PM. Bundesbank reduces interest rates again - by half a
percentage point, triggering wave of cuts across Europe. Megamergers
continue: Bell Atlantic agrees to buy cable TV group Tele-Communications for
around Dollars 20bn. GEC announces 1p per share bid for Ferranti. But Leeds
Permanent and National &amp; Provincial building societies abandon merger plans.
British supermarket chains fail in legal attempt to stop opening of Costco
discount superstore in Essex. Baroness Thatcher's memoirs published. Michael
Jordan, basketball star with the Chicago Bulls, announces his retirement.
Government announces plans to implement some of Sheehy proposals for police
reform but drops idea of fixed term contracts. Timex employees vote to end

according to figures from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information
company.
The report indicates small companies are finding it harder to climb out of
recession than big ones, but finds further signs that the recovery is
becoming better established.
The total for companies going into liquidation or becoming bankrupt in
England and Wales fell 11.5 per cent in the final quarter of this year
compared with the corresponding period last year. There was a 19.8 per cent
yearly decline in the third quarter.
The figures show that the worst places for small businesses appear to be the
west Midlands and north-west and north-east England, which all saw slight
increases in small-business failures over the year.
Total business failures in 1993 came to 48,066, down 7.5 per cent on the
51,947 registered last year. This compares with a 30.4 per cent rise in
collapses last year from 39,827 in 1991. This year's figure is roughly twice
that for 1990, the start of the recession, and is well above the peak in
failures during the 1980s of 21,682, recorded in 1984. Part of the reason
for the large number of collapses in recent years is that many of the new
companies which mushroomed during the late 1980s boom encountered financial
difficulties during the recession.
Liquidations of large limited companies fell 14.4 per cent this year to
19,220, from 22,444 last year, while bankruptcies of small businesses fell
by only 2.3 per cent, to 28,846. In the fourth quarter of this year, total
business collapses came to 11,863, down on the 13,397 recorded in the final
three months of last year. This last figure was the highest quarterly number
of failures during the period of low economic growth. Failures in the fourth
quarter of this year were slightly higher than the particularly low 10,320
collapses in the third quarter, though comfortably down on the 13,235
between April and June.
In Scotland, collapses totalled 7,667 this year after 10,820 last year.
However the figures are distorted by changes in Scots bankruptcy laws
introduced this year. In the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, failures
totalled 55,733, down 11.2 per cent last year.

British Rail yesterday announced plans for new passenger services and
shorter journey times for its summer 1994 timetable, the last it will
control before privatisation begins next year.
The improvements include new direct services from Manchester Airport to
Glasgow and Edinburgh. Cardiff will be linked via Bristol to London Waterloo
to connect with Channel tunnel services.
New services will include Maidstone to Gatwick Airport, and West Worthing to
Eastbourne via Brighton. BR says it hopes to provide more trains on popular
routes, and to open more than 10 new stations.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Outlook mixed for building industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrasting views on the outlook for the construction industry emerged
yesterday with a forecast of a modest rise in building and civil engineering
output accompanied by a warning of further job losses and company closures,
Andrew Taylor writes.
Dr Richard Roberts, senior economist at Barclays Bank, forecast that the
value of construction output measured in constant 1985 prices would increase
next year.
He said that recovery in private-sector retail and residential output would
offset a decline in local authority spending.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that while construction
output might rise slightly next year 'it will not be without further
casualties'.

The number of new businesses has risen for the first time since 1989,
figures from Barclays Bank show.
Based on data from its branchs, Barclays believes that 409,000 enterprises
started in 1993, an increase of 13 per cent on last year.
The figures show 2.37m UK businesses are now operating.
The figures, which cover many small enterprises not accounted for by other
surveys, show that a total of 515,000 businesses closed this year - 6 per
cent down on last year.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Car parts sector faces slow growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of cars in the UK will grow by nearly 5m to just under 29m by the
end of the decade, but there is no prospect of the replacement parts sector
matching this growth, warns a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Demand by vehicle manufacturers for longer-lasting components is the most
significant of a number of 'radical' changes within the sector that are
already constraining growth, says the report.
The EIU, in its first large-scale study of the replacement-parts sector for
four years, has found that the market has shrunk slightly - mainly in the
recession - since 1989. And in spite of a swiftly rising new-car market, the
study predicts growth for the replacement-parts sector of less than 2 per
cent a year between now and 1996.
This would lift sales from an estimated Pounds 4.08bn this year to Pounds
4.34bn in 1996.
Vehicle makers are demanding that some important components last the life of
the car, the study says. Other components are also lasting longer,
'sometimes by as much as 100 per cent'. The study adds: 'Long term this may
prove to be the single most important factor in determining the future of
this market.'
Profit margins are being squeezed by greatly increased competition, to the
benefit of consumers. For example, vehicle makers have been forced to reduce
their own replacement-parts prices to compete with independents. Ford,
Vauxhall, Rover and Peugeot have also opened up dealer-based 'fast fit'
networks, in an attempt to wrest back business lost to groups such as
Kwik-Fit Euro.
The study has found 'decline or at least stagnation' in the parts
distribution sector, with cash and carry outlets worst hit in terms of
business closures. However, 'retail chains, superstores and service centres
have not maintained their promised growth and their profits have suffered'.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Land Rover increases output by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Land Rover, the four-wheel-drive subsidiary of British Aerospace's Rover
Group, increased output by nearly a fifth this year in spite of the downturn
in Continental new vehicle markets.
Land Rover's managers believe that the Solihull-based company, whose
workforce has increased by 600 to 8,700 over the past few months, is poised
to enjoy the best year in its nearly half-century history.
If output levels are maintained 1994 production is expected to reach 80,000
units, a 16 per cent rise on the record year of 1990 when 68,621 were built.
Production this year at 68,159 was only 0.7 per cent below the 1990 record.
Among factors boosting the company's confidence is the expected recovery
next year in Continental markets, the launch in North America this spring of
the Discovery, the company's biggest-selling model, and the start of sales
through 400 Honda dealers in Japan of a Discovery model rebadged as the
Honda Crossroads. About two-thirds of output is exported.
Weekly production of 1,830 units has required the introduction of a night
shift for the first time and compares with weekly output of 1,290 at the
start of this year.
Discovery output this year jumped 46 per cent to 35,620 from 24,347, helped
by UK demand where 1992's total Discovery sales of 19,989 were exceeded in
this year's first nine months. Output of the Defender was lower than in 1992
at 17,590 compared with 17,651, as was the Range Rover at 14,949 compared
with 15,334.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Christmas lift for book sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Book publishers have had their best Christmas for at least three years,
according to a study by market research group MarketLine International,
Raymond Snoddy writes.
The retail value of books sold in the UK last year was Pounds 2.52bn, a
figure which is estimated to rise to Pounds 2.7bn this year and Pounds
2.95bn in 1994.
Consumers spent Pounds 1.7bn on books this year, almost 5 per cent of all
recreational spending with every man, women and child buying an average of
seven books each.
Sixty-seven per cent of revenue comes from consumer books, 25 per cent from
academic and professional and 8 per cent from school books.
The volume of book sales is expected to rise to 405m copies next year from
401m this. There is no sign of a drop in reading, despite increased
competition from electronic media.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Boost for rented housing urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should introduce new incentives to encourage greater
investment in private rented housing after Business Expansion Schemes end
today, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says in a report.
A study by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand commissioned by the Social Research
Foundation estimates that BES schemes have raised more than Pounds 2bn,
providing 40,000 private-sector lettings.
The foundation proposes that, in place of BES schemes, the government should
create investment trusts for authorised private rented housing which would
be exempt from capital gains tax.
'These would enable pension funds and other non-taxpayers to take an
indirect stake in rented housing without being actively involved in
landlords and without incurring tax along the way,' the foundation says.
The trusts would encourage private renting without any immediate additional
costs to the exchequer, it says.
The foundation also recommended the introduction of capital grants for
private landlords. Instead of paying grants at a flat percentage rate,
landlords would bid from a cash-limited fund which would allocate money to
those proposing the most effective developments.
A Pounds 150m fund would be sufficient to create 15,000 more homes with a
total value of Pounds 750m, the report says.
It estimates that BES schemes in total had generated 60,000 lettings
including those by housing associations and university accommodation but at
a cost of Pounds 20,000 per dwelling in tax refunds.
'Our proposals point to a more efficient way of sustaining the momentum
created by BES,' the report says. It estimates that there was still only one
genuine private letting in Britain to every 20 homes in owner-occupation.
This was 'inhibiting choice and creating a drag on economic efficiency'.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Soldier killed in Ulster: Unionist discontent at prime
ministers' peace accord grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A British soldier shot yesterday in the Northern Ireland border town of
Crossmaglen died in hospital later. It was the first terrorist murder in the
province since a blueprint for a peace accord was agreed more than a
fortnight ago by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds.
The 23-year-old soldier was the ninth member of the security forces killed
by IRA snipers in the border areas of south Armagh and County Fermanagh in
the past two years.
The shooting underlined the increasingly hardline tone of republican
paramilitary groups towards the document from the two premiers. Mr John Fee,
a Social Democratic and Labour party councillor who lives near Crossmaglen,
said of the shooting: 'There are many throughout the nationalist and
republican community who will be saying this should not have happened.'
The shooting came amid growing discontent in the Ulster Unionist party, the
largest unionist party. UUP support is seen by the two governments as
essential to the success of the peace initiative.
Sir John Wheeler, security minister at the Northern Ireland Office,
condemned the shooting as a 'wicked crime', but he stopped short of
threatening a security clampdown.
The hardening of attitudes among republicans has prompted calls from
unionist leaders for immediate tougher government security measures. It has
also fuelled doubts about the peace process among some UUP members.
UUP leaders said that yesterday's shooting would not be allowed to derail
the peace process. Although the leadership's cautious endorsement of the
premiers' declaration appears to have wide support, the tactics have also
provoked anger. One UUP councillor said: 'There's a lot of people here who
are very unhappy with the declaration.'
Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said dissenters were
a minority in the party.
The Rev Roy Magee, a Belfast minister who has had talks with loyalist
paramilitary groups, said they had been prepared to give the peace process a
chance. But yesterday's shooting of the soldier might threaten that.

One-third of ambulance services in England and 44 per cent in Wales are

The union said that the problem was exacerbated by cuts in staffing and

cent since 1987 and there was a 10 per cent cut in spending between 1980 and
1990, it added.

Engineers were last night preparing to carry out detailed inspections
following a crucial test on the Sizewell B nuclear power station containment
building - the barrier designed to prevent any release of radioactivity,
David Green writes.
Pressure inside the sphere-shaped building on the Suffolk coast has been
pumped up during the past two days in excess of the maximum it is thought
likely to have to withstand in the event of a major accident.
The building, which is larger than St Paul's cathedral, expanded by 5mm. The
test was carried out on the innermost of the two 'skins' which make up the
sphere, the central part of the Pounds 2.03bn power station.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Fresh setback for British Library
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defective wiring is the latest in a series of misfortunes to have plagued
the construction of the Pounds 450m new home for the British Library at St
Pancras in London.
The project, running several years late and substantially over its original
budget, has attracted widespread criticism over the way it has been managed.
The first phase of the development - forecast to cost Pounds 116m when it
was launched in 1978 by the then edu-cation secretary Mrs Shirley Williams -
is due to be handed over next year. It is now expected to have cost at least
Pounds 300m and will be much smaller than originally planned.
It was not known yesterday whether the latest setback, described by
officials as serious, will cause further delays.
Copper wire, normally protected by plastic casing, is understood to have
become exposed leaving the system vulnerable to short-circuiting.
An interim report from Kennedy &amp; Donkin, the Surrey-based engineering
consultants, is believed to estimate that up to 80 per cent of the first
phase wiring may be affected.
A 1991 report by the Commons public accounts committee, the public spending
watchdog, strongly criticised the Office of Arts and Libraries, the
department responsible for commissioning the building, and the Property
Services Agency, which is over-seeing its design and construction.
It blamed both bodies for 'serious management weaknesses', for cost
increases and for producing an unsuitable building. When both phases are
completed in 1996 it will seat 1,176 readers - only 73 more than can be
housed currently - compared with the 3,440 originally planned.
In 1991 the development hit fresh problems when mobile shelves, made in the
Netherlands, jammed and the anti-corrosive paint covering them peeled. Their
replacement at the makers' expense caused a further two-year delay in the
project, which was expected to have been completed in the late 1980s.
The PSA projects division, responsible for the library, was acquired last
year by Tarmac, the UK construction company, which has no financial
liability for defects to the St Pancras development caused before it
acquired the business.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Pumping ends today at Durham colliery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pumping at disused Murton colliery in County Durham is to end today after
detailed technical discussions between British Coal and the National Rivers
Authority, the river pollution watchdog.
The NRA said yesterday that it was satisfied that the end of pumping at
Murton, which ceased production two years ago, would not cause water
pollution. But British Coal, which has been spending about Pounds 6m
annually on pumping in the Durham field, will retain mine shafts at the
former Dawdon and Easington collieries, to which Murton's abandoned workings
are linked, so pumping could resume if required.

More than 50 police stations are set to close across south Wales and about
200 police and civilian jobs could be axed after the region's police
authority yesterday failed to resolve a Pounds 14m budget shortfall.
Leaders of three Labour-controlled county councils in Glamorgan, which
partly finance the authority, blamed the government for failing to ensure a

FT  31 DEC 93 / Arms sales to Serbia denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heckler &amp; Koch, a subsidiary of the UK armaments manufacturer, Royal
Ordnance, yesterday denied allegations that it had illegally supplied small
arms to Serbia in contravention of arms embargoes.
The allegations are the latest twist to reports that throughout the 1980s,
Heckler &amp; Koch and Royal Ordnance - which bought the German concern in 1991
 -were part of an international cartel illegally selling arms to a variety
of countries.
In developments apart from the Serbian arms sales allegation, Mr Walter
Lamp, the former manager director of Heckler &amp; Koch, is to be tried in
Germany on charges that Heckler &amp; Koch in conjunction with Royal Ordnance
diverted arms through the UK to illegal destinations such as Nicaragua and
Iraq.
The mention of Iraq as a destination has lead the Scott arms-to-Iraq enquiry
office in London to admit that it will be investigating allegations arising
from the German trial.
Meanwhile, Customs and Excise yesterday strongly denied reports that it has
supplied documents backing claims that Iran may also have been a beneficiary
of explosives sales channelled through the UK by Royal Ordnance.
A Customs official yesterday insisted no such documents had ever been passed
over to the department's investigators.
The Scott enquiry also denied the report, saying all Customs documents
relevant to the probe were handed over before Mr Justice Scott began his
inquiry.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Back to Britain

<TEXT>
The US is giving Little America back to Britain, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The Burtonwood airbase at Warrington in Cheshire will be formally handed
over in April. At its peak, shortly after the second world war, Burtonwood's
600 acres housed 18,000 Americans, making it the biggest single site for US
personnel in Britain.
The last symbol of those days is a 2m sq ft warehouse leased from the
Ministry of Defence for more than half a century. The US is spending Pounds
2m refurbishing it, having vacated it in October.
The site is to be developed as a business park for inward investors. Its
location in what became known as Little America is to be promoted all over
the US to attract companies, playing on wartime memories.

FT  31 DEC 93 / CBI cool on government school 'promoters' scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business yesterday gave a lukewarm reception to the government's initiative
to help 'promoters' establish new grant-maintained schools in England and
Wales.
Under the scheme, 'promoters' may establish schools, which can have
different specialisms and selection policies, provided they pay at least 15
per cent of building costs, and their plans are approved by the education
secretary. The government will pay the remaining 85 per cent.
The Confederation of British Industry said yesterday: 'In the past, there's
been very little enthusiasm on the behalf of members for industry funding of
education. On the whole companies feel that schools should be paid for by
general taxation.'
When the City Technology College initiative, which was intended to harness
business sponsorship on a much more ambitious scale, was launched in 1988,
the CBI remarked that businesses already paid corporation tax. Just 15 CTCs
 -fewer than planned - have been completed.
The Institute of Directors said: 'Our view is that the state provides funds
for education at least up until the age of 16 but the state doesn't have to
be the provider of those services. Diversity in the people having services
funded by the state seems to be an entirely good thing.'
The government's move will also be the cue for intensive efforts by the
Moslem community to gain public funding for Moslem schools. There are 20
Moslem schools in England and Wales, all independently funded. Community
leaders are keen to gain access to public funds, along the lines of
voluntary-aided Anglican, Catholic and Jewish schools.
The education department has sent copies of its draft guidance on the new
schools to two Moslem education groups.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, doubted that many schools would be created by 'promoters'. He
expects the Funding Agency for Schools, an education department quango which
will start work in April, to be much more powerful in establishing new
schools where the need exists.

<TEXT>
The British government said yesterday it would begin pulling its troops out
of Belize this weekend, Reuter reports from Guatemala City.
The UK, which announced last May that it would end its 45-year military
presence in the former British colony, has about 1,350 troops there. By the
end of next September all but 50 will be gone, the government said in a
statement issued by the British embassy in Guatemala City. Those remaining
will run a jungle training school for British troops.
British troops have been stationed in Belize to counter possible aggression
from Guatemala, which claimed the country as its own until recognising
Belize's sovereignty in 1991. A border dispute continues but the British
government said the pull-out reflected confidence in improved relations
between the two countries.

FT  31 DEC 93 / US textile industry sees record sales and exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US textile industry, long among the most protected of US sectors, is
emerging from 1993 with record sales, exports, production and capital
spending, and a determination to compete in overseas markets.
The industry waged a long battle against the 10-year phase-out of the
Multifibre Arrangement agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations,
but is by no means certain to oppose the Round's implementing legislation in
the US Congress.
The sector's strategy evolved from insistence on protectionism, to pushing a
long phase-out of quotas to acceptance of a shorter phase-out on terms
favourable to the industry. Now industry officials talk of the Round's
potential for boosting foreign sales and opening foreign markets with the
same relish as their counterparts in services, high technology and export
manufacturing.
'The changing world of international trade in textiles means we must take
advantage of every opportunity to export,' said Mr Henry Truslow, president
of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute in a year-end statement.
Mr Truslow stressed the positive results of the Uruguay Round and the
possibility some of the main textile exporters, Pakistan and India, will
agree to significant market openings by April 15 when the final text is to
be signed in Morocco.
'If they open up, they will also be trading with each other,' said Mr Jim
Morrissey, an ATMI spokesman. 'That will take some of the heat off us.'
The ATMI's embrace of freer trade is being met with cynicism among lobbyists
who fought its protectionist efforts for years. 'I would be really stunned
if the ATMI supported this deal,' said Ms Robin Lanier, for the
International Mass Retail Association.
Yet ATMI had significant victories in the Round. Quotas will be phased out
but tariff protection will remain. The US agreed to cut tariffs by 11 per
cent, which brings down average tariffs from 18 to 16 per cent.
According to the ATMI officials, 39 countries so far have agreed to open
their markets to foreign imports. They say that countries which fail to
provide 'effective' market access, a term still to be defined, may be taken
to the new dispute settlement mechanism under the World Trade Organisation,
where the outcome could be denial of the accelerated quota growth agreed in
the Uruguay Round.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Salomon's trader has to pay up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Thomas Murphy, former senior Salomon Brothers bond trader, has been
ordered by the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay Dollars 300,000 in
civil penalties for his part in the Treasury auction scandal which nearly
brought the Wall Street securities firm to its knees in 1991.
He was also barred from the securities industry for two years, and
prohibited from taking any proprietary or supervisory roles in the business
for five years.
In consenting to the judgment, Mr Murphy neither admitted nor denied the
SEC's allegations that he submitted false customer bids in three auctions of
US government securities in 1990 and falsified books and records of the
bids.
Two weeks ago Mr Paul Mozer, a former colleague on Salomon's bond trading
desk, was jailed for four months and fined Dollars 30,000 after pleading
guilty to lying to Treasury officials over the bids.
The scandal erupted in Aug-ust 1991 when it was found that the bond desk had
bid for government securities on behalf of customers without their
knowledge, and that Sal-omon executives had known about such bids for months
before telling the authorities.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taipei share prices rose 5 per cent yesterday to post the highest index
close since June 1991, after a call from economics minister PK Chiang for
the state to open limited direct shipping links with China. Led by the
financial sector, which gained 6.6 per cent, the weighted index rose 275.48
points to close at 5,813.55.
The surge continued early today, with the weighted index rising a further
200 points in the first minutes of trading.
Taiwan's private sector has lobbied for an end to the ban on cross-strait
transportation, which forces most trade with China through Hong Kong. Mr
Chiang's remarks marked the first time a senior official has publicly broken
ranks with the government over its opposition to direct links with China.
But analysts cautioned it was unlikely direct links will be opened for
several years.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Sudan expels British envoy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sudan last night ordered the British ambassador, Mr Peter Streams, to leave
the country within two weeks. The move appears to be in retaliation for a
visit to the south of the country by Dr George Carey, Archbishop of
Canterbury.
A Foreign Office spokesman in London said that Mr Abdul Rahman Bakhit,
Sudanese charge d'affaires, was being summoned 'in order to demand an
explanation of this totally unjustified action'.
Dr Carey flew to the rebel-held south yesterday from Nairobi in defiance of
a ban from the Sudanese government. He had earlier declined an invitation by
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, to pay an official visit to Khartoum.
'It is a sad development but it is the right and necessary decision,' Canon
Roger Symon, secretary for Anglican Communion Affairs, said earlier. 'We did
not want him to be identified with the government rather than the Church.'
Dr Carey had explained he travelled overseas only as a guest of the local
Anglican church.
The radical Islamic regime in Khartoum has denied accusations it
discriminates against the country's more than 3m Christians. It faced bitter
criticism in September when an Anglican bishop was flogged in Khartoum after
an Islamic court found him guilty of adultery. Bishop Peter Birish was given
80 lashes.
Dr Carey had planned to meet Christians in Khartoum, Juba and the Nuba
mountains as well as seeing government leaders to discuss inter-faith and
humanitarian matters. 'But the government wanted to control the archbishop's
programme and by implication this meant they would decide who he sees or
does not see, where he goes or does not go. We found this unacceptable,'
Canon Symon said.
Dr Carey plans to meet leaders of the two factions of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army which are fighting for autonomy for the south.
Sudan's military-led government, which came to power in 1989, has become
increasingly strident in its support of radical Islamic movements, and
earlier this month was host to a three-day session of the Arab and Islamic
Popular Congress which aims to defend Moslems against perceived western
aggression.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Singh defends role over scandal: MPs walk out during
emotional address by Indian finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, yesterday staunchly defended
his role in dealing with the Bombay financial scandal and warned against
taking precipitate action against foreign banks.
Mr Singh addressed parliament at the end of a two-day debate on a report by
a joint parliamentary committee which strongly criticised the Finance
Ministry as well as virtually every other party involved in the scandal.
He has tendered his resignation to Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister.
Although Mr Rao has not indicated whether he will accept it, the prime
minister told parliament he agreed with what Mr Singh had said and added
action would be taken 'wherever it is called for'.
Mr Singh acknowledged 'full constitutional responsibility' for decisions
taken by his ministry. But he denied he had failed to detect weaknesses in
the financial and banking system, and said financial sector reform was under
way.
His voice choked with emotion, Mr Singh denied he had been 'indifferent or
unconcerned' and that his ministry had ignored an overheated stock exchange.
He said he had ordered raids on brokers in February 1992 to find out the
source of money fuelling the stock market boom. He had told the Reserve Bank
of India, the central bank, to investigate whether state-run banks were
funnelling money illegally to the brokers.
'It found out that the State Bank of India was giving away funds to some of
these brokers. That was the beginning of (the revelation of) the scam,' Mr
Singh said.
He disputed the committee's contention that foreign banks were the
originators of the scandal. 'The root of the stock market scam was that the
boom took place and the nationalised banks were not allowed to lend to
brokers through the front door, so they found a back door.'
Mr Singh said the government had stopped the repatriation of profits for the
financial year to March 1992 of the four banks accused in the scandal -
Standard Chartered, ANZ Grindlay's, BankAmerica and Citicorp. But he
suggested the government would not accept the committee's suggestion that it
remove their licences.
'We must caution ourselves that we live in a civilised world and therefore
any action that we take against them has to be fair and square,' Mr Singh
said. 'The government will see to it that the foreign banks function within
the four corners of the country's laws and proper action will be taken if
any of them breach the law.'
Opposition MPs demanded that Mr Singh's resignation be accepted, and members
from the ruling Congress party pleaded his case. The finance minister
addressed a half-empty house after opposition members walked out, insisting
that the prime minister, and not Mr Singh, conclude the debate. Mr Shivraj
Patil, the speaker, overruled them.
The Janata Dal (A) party, a splinter group of 10 opposition MPs led by Mr
Ajit Singh, yesterday joined Congress, giving an absolute majority to the
ruling party in the lower house of parliament with 266 of the 544 seats.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Late concessions clear way for Israeli budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's parliament was last night expected to approve a Shk126.5bn (Pounds
28.6bn) budget for 1994, up from Shk103bn this year, after last-minute
concessions to various political parties.
The budget provides for a deficit of Shk7.6bn - or 3 per cent of gross
domestic product - which the government says will be met by the sale of
shares in government-owned companies (expected to raise Shk4.6bn next year)
and foreign loans, including use of US soft loan guarantees worth Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year. Last year's deficit was 3.2 per cent of GDP.
The government says its strategy of moving away from borrowing in the local
capital market will create a long-term environment for lower interest rates
and better incentives for investment.
However, on the eve of the budget's passage the Bank of Israel raised
interest rates to curb inflation, expected to rise to 11.5 per cent next
year. The prime lending rate will climb from 11 to 11.8 per cent.
The move was criticised by the ministry of finance, which said the only way
to fight inflation was to take measures to bring down housing costs.
Before yesterday's Knesset debate the government fought a tough battle to
secure the necessary parliamentary support.
Some Labour MPs insisted on big changes in the social welfare provisions for
the elderly and the poor and threatened to vote down the budget unless their
demands were met.
Other concessions were made to the ultra-orthodox Shas and Agudah parties
and to MPs from Arab parties.
Under the budget, government investment in infrastructure will increase by
15 per cent next year. The rise is primarily absorbed by doubling
expenditure on roads to Shk1.8bn and increasing the education budget by 25
per cent from Shk8bn to Shk10bn. The defence budget is set at Shk20.2bn,
including foreign aid, and is expected to drop 3-4 per cent by the end of
the decade.
The government proposes a number of taxation changes, including a gradual
lowering of corporate tax from 39 per cent to 36 per cent in 1996 and an
adjustment of income tax rates to a maximum of 50 per cent, with cuts
focused on the middle-income bracket. Tax revenues are expected to increase
9 per cent in real terms.
Inflation is forecast to drop to 8 per cent from 10.4 per cent, unemployment
will be reduced to 9.4 per cent from 10.2 per cent and GDP will grow 5.3 per
cent, against 3.5 per cent for 1993.

FT  31 DEC 93 / US textile industry sees record sales and exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US textile industry, long among the most protected of US sectors, is
emerging from 1993 with record sales, exports, production and capital
spending, and an avowed determination to compete in overseas markets.
The industry waged a long battle against the 10-year phase-out of the
Multifibre Arrangement agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations,
but is by no means certain to oppose the Round's implementing legislation in
the US Congress.
The industry's strategy has evolved from insistence on protectionism, to
pushing a long phase-out of quotas to acceptance of a shorter phase-out on
terms favourable to the industry.
Now industry officials are talking of the Round's potential for boosting
foreign sales and opening foreign markets with the same relish as their
counterparts in services, high technology and export manufacturing.
'The changing world of international trade in textiles means we must take
advantage of every opportunity to export,' said Mr Henry Truslow, president
of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute in a year-end statement.
'That is where there is potential for growth for our industry.'
Mr Truslow stressed the positive results of the Uruguay Round and the
possibility that some of the main textile exporters, Pakistan and India,
will agree to significant market openings by April 15 when the final text is
to be signed in Morocco.
'If they open up, they will also be trading with each other,' said Mr Jim
Morrissey, an ATMI spokesman. 'That will take some of the heat off us.'
The ATMI's embrace of freer trade is being met with cynicism among lobbyists
who fought its protectionist efforts for years. 'I would be really stunned
if the ATMI supported this deal,' said Ms Robin Lanier, for the
International Mass Retail Association.
Yet ATMI had significant victories in the Round. Quotas will be phased out
but tariff protection will remain. The US agreed to cut tariffs by 11 per
cent, which brings down average tariffs from 18 to 16 per cent.
According to the ATMI officials, 39 countries so far have agreed to open
their markets to foreign imports.
They say that countries which fail to provide 'effective' market access, a
term still to be defined, may be taken to the new dispute settlement
mechanism under the World Trade Organisation, where the outcome could be
denial of the accelerated quota growth agreed in the Uruguay Round.
Even if ATMI supports the Gatt deal, the textile and apparel unions will
oppose it, as will many congressman who represent them, Ms Lanier warned.
Although 'not particularly worried' about getting congressional approval of
the implementing legislation, many issues remain to be settled about the
quota phase-out, including integration procedures and which products get
phased out first.
'The industry will try its darndest to get relatively meaningless categories
graduated earliest,' Ms Lanier said.
Meanwhile, US textile producers seem confident, buoyed by potential of the
Latin American market offered by the North American Free Trade Agreement. It
took some of the record profits it earned in 1992 and invested Dollars 2.3bn
(Pounds 1.55bn) in modernisation this year. Profits in 1993 were a healthy
Dollars 1.5bn, though 29 per cent down from the previous year.
Import volume grew 8 per cent, reaching a record high of 15.7bn square
metres. But exports also showed significant gains, recording a new high of
5.9bn square metres.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Japanese feel the pinch with pleasure: The Book of Honest
Poverty has sold over 600,000 copies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILL DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poverty has become a fashion industry in recession-hit Japan.
The public's former fondness for electronic gadgets, garish clutter and
designer clothes has switched to cheap practical goods and services, an
end-of-year survey by Trendy, a consumer magazine, says.
The hit products and ideas of the past 12 months include cheap men's suits -
less than Y20,000 (Pounds 119.76) - and discount own-brands at Daiei,
Japan's biggest cut-price supermarket chain.
Others are direct clothes sales from factories, all-you-can-eat restaurants,
and the book Seihin no Shiso (Concept of Honest Poverty), which sold more
than 600,000 copies in its first 10 months. Import bargains from the yen's
rise have done well, from cars to processed food.
Trendy's listing is based on factors such as sales growth, novelty and
consumer impact. Smaller recession successes, which failed to make it to the
Trendy list, include a cut-price marriage service at Y300 (Pounds 1.79) per
guest (booked up until next April) and sweet potato spirit, the cheapest
non-lethal liquor available, and the only class of alcoholic drink to record
extra sales this year.
Pressure on wages and jobs is an obvious reason for the fad for cheapness.
Yet Dentsu Institute for Human Studies, the research arm of Japan's largest
advertising group, detects a deeper reaction against the materialism of
recent years. 'As Japanese have satisfied most of their material needs, they
will seek new spiritual tendencies, aesthetic values and philosophies,' the
institute says. One such new tendency is the spectacular arrival early in
the year of J-League, Japan's professional soccer league. The thrills of
soccer have struck more than 4m ticket buyers to date, as an appealing
contrast to the relative dignity of baseball and sumo wrestling.
Since kick-off from zero early in the year, the J-League is estimated to
have pulled in Y10bn of ticket revenues and generated at least Y30bn in
sales of products bearing its logo. This marketing phenomenon extends to
J-League pot noodles, chocolate and batteries. One balding league player has
even agreed to advertise wigs on TV. Trendy quotes one estimate that the the
multiplier effect of all this exceeds Y500bn.
Materialism is still just about alive, perhaps helped by consumers' fondness
for brand labels. But the J-League has also offered low-price entertainment
at a time when budgets are tight.
One formerly popular leisure industry, costly hostess bars, has fallen on
hard times. Now, trend-conscious salarymen spend their evenings more
cheaply, at the growing number of discos modelled on Juliana's in Tokyo,
where scantily-clad 'bodycon' (body-conscious) girls used to wriggle on
raised catwalks.
Juliana's has sold more than 2m compact discs this year, according to
Trendy, but has been so embarrassed by the publicity that it took down its
catwalk. Too late. Bodycon girls' new style of dancing is catching on in
regional towns.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Tough talks bring deal on trade within sight: Monetary
policy remains stumbling block
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are close to finalising a free-trade
agreement which will determine economic relations once Israel and the PLO
conclude an agreement on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza-Jericho.
Both sides know the broader regional peace agreement - the subject of
delicate negotiations in Cairo - will fail unless Palestinians, who have
one-fifth the average income of Israelis, see dramatic economic improvements
in the first few months after the troop withdrawal, due to be completed by
April 13.
Talks in Paris on economic issues have been tough but agreement in principle
has been reached in most areas, including taxation, labour and trade.
Monetary policy remains the biggest obstacle to a protocol, with the
Palestinians demanding the right to establish a central bank and to issue
their own currency.
The main achievement in the Paris talks has been agreement on free movement
of goods and services under one customs policy, with substantial exceptions
to meet the special needs of the Palestinian economy.
These exceptions have still to be negotiated but Israel has already conceded
that Palestinians will be able to import vehicles at their own tariff rates.
Other goods the Palestinians want to import at lower duties, such as
construction materials, offer greater hurdles but Israeli officials say they
are prepared to make concessions.
The Palestinians will also have some exceptions from the joint customs
policy to allow for imports from Jordan.
In agriculture, Israel has agreed to end a ban on the importation of
Palestinian agricultural produce which has been in force since 1967. As soon
as the Palestinians take control of Gaza-Jericho, agricultural products -
excluding poultry, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers and potatoes - will be allowed
free export to Israel.
The excluded products will be subject to a quota system, with the quotas
increased progressively over four years and phased out in year five. Israeli
farmers, who have enjoyed years of protection, have already protested
against this step.
On taxation, the two sides have agreed to differing rates of income tax.
Palestinians working in Israel will pay tax to the Israeli treasury while
Israelis working in the territories will pay the Palestinian treasury. Both
sides have agreed to levy value added tax but have still to work out how to
meet Palestinian demands for a lower rate than that of Israel.
On monetary policy, however, the two sides remain deeply divided. The
Palestinians want the right to issue a currency with no limits on when the
Palestinian pound would be minted. The Palestinians accept that the Israeli
shekel and the Jordanian dinar will be legal tender in the short-term but
want the right to print their own money.
Israel believes this is not feasible and are hoping for what one official
described as 'the Scotland model', with the Bank of Israel retaining control
over the printing of money but minting a separate design for Palestinians.
An Israeli official admitted the dispute would have to be resolved at a
political level.
Both sides hope they can reach an economic agreement by the end of January,
although recent complications cast a shadow over the entire negotiating
process. However, if all issues are agreed, the economic accord should cover
Gaza-Jericho from April 13.
Israeli officials said the deal would also apply to the rest of the West
Bank, with minor exceptions, after the Palestinian elections due to be held
in July.

FT  31 DEC 93 / South Africa's coloureds are key to National party hopes:
Ruling party needs support of some of apartheid's victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It must rank as one of the stranger paradoxes of apartheid that the
electoral prospects of South Africa's long-ruling National party now depend
on those who were its victims: blacks, Indians, and especially the
mixed-race 'coloureds' who share the Afrikaans language and other cultural
traits with their former oppressors.
For the party to reach critical mass in the all-race elections next April -
the 20 or 25 per cent of the vote needed effectively to counterbalance an
African National Congress government - it must win a majority of votes from
the 3.2m coloureds.
Opinion polls show negligible support for the NP among blacks (though fear
of intimidation may affect replies); support among the 1m Indians hovers
between 40 and 50 per cent; and while support from the 5m whites is
volatile, and could rise once the party election machine enters top gear,
latest figures (from the Human Sciences Research Council) give the NP only
28 per cent of whites.
Ironically, given the fact that the NP had coloureds removed from the common
voters' roll in the 1950s, polls reflect higher support from coloureds than
whites. The same HSRC poll, taken in July, registers 44 per cent coloured
support for the National party, against only 12 per cent for the ANC.
So the battle is on for the coloured voter, especially in Western Cape
province which will be one of only two of the nine new electoral provinces
where blacks are not a majority. Coloureds are believed to be the majority
in the Western Cape and in the Northern Cape province, though no one knows
the true number of Africans living in huge squatter settlements near Cape
Town.
The Western Cape is central to NP strategy: it is the only province where
the party has a chance of controlling provincial government, and many
conservative 'Nats' see it as a bolthole for whites if black government goes
wrong.
The ANC is determined to deny the Nats this victory, and polls show a shift
in support toward the organisation in recent months (but only from 6 to 12
per cent, according to the HSRC). But in Mitchell's Plain - a large coloured
township outside Cape Town which the ANC must win to capture the Western
Cape - ANC organisers admit they face an uphill battle.
'Racism is still very real among coloured people. Apartheid was very
successful in that,' says Mr Claude Mallins, a young ANC campaigner in
Mitchell's Plain, which was built to house coloureds forcibly removed from
Cape Town's District Six in one of the most notorious evictions of the
apartheid era. He highlights the irony that racism between coloureds and
blacks is at least as potent as between white and black. 'People have fears
about black domination, about what is going to happen to their houses, to
their money,' he adds.
Mr Siraj Karjieker, manager of the local shopping mall, puts it more
bluntly: 'The man in the street is virulently anti-black. I say 'black' but
they say 'kaffir' right out.'
Mr Vincent van Breda, an articulate young ANC campaigner, believes the
identity crisis of the coloureds - a race formed by blending white, black,
Malay, Indian, Hottentot and Bushman - has much to do with this. 'In terms
of world outlook, we are western European. But we walk around with this
black skin. . . or not-so-white skin. Lots of us haven't worked through that
tension yet. We live between the black and the white worlds. It's going to
take years. . . decades. . . generations to unbundle this.'
In the shopping precinct outside Mr van Breda's office, this confusion is
readily apparent. Two young shoppers say they are certain to vote NP: 'When
the National party was ruling the land everything was going well,' they
assert. Asked how they can vote for their former oppressors, they reply 'it
was (former President P W) Botha who oppressed us, it wasn't (President F W)
de Klerk. He changed things.'
The manageress of a local shop points to a recent case where black squatters
occupied newly-built coloured homes - an act condemned by the ANC - and
asks, 'Already they are moving into our houses so what will happen when they
are in power?'
Conversely, several local hawkers say they will vote ANC, support for which
is clearly growing. But many more express lack of interest, saying they will
not vote at all. While all polls indicate many undecided voters, some show
up to half of coloureds will not vote.
Mr Mallins predicts a close race in Mitchell's Plain. He thinks the fight
against racism will be long and hard. 'But this is an African continent,' he
says. 'In the end, we must learn to live together.'

FT  31 DEC 93 / Foreign investment in India on the rise
</HEADLINE>

   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government has approved foreign investment worth Rs79.9bn (Pounds
1.7bn) for the first 11 months of this year, doubling last year's figure of
Rs38.9bn and outstripping the Rs5.3bn approved in 1991 when an economic
liberalisation package was introduced, writes Shiraz Sidhva. Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister, said the unprecedented response by investors to
the new industrial policy was also reflected in total foreign direct
investment of Rs122.91bn for the period between August 1991 and November
1993.
An official release said that investment from the US had risen to Rs33.44bn
this year, from Rs12.31bn in 1992. Investment from the UK had increased to
Rs6.08bn from Rs1.17bn and there had been gains in investment from Germany,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Japan and Singapore. Non-resident
Indians worldwide contributed Rs6.82bn to the total.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Bosnian Serb leader yesterday signalled plans to push forward with the
creation of Greater Serbia by the end of next year, regardless of punitive
sanctions against Serb-led Yugoslavia.
Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, the speaker of the Serb parliament, said he expected a
union of self-styled Serb states in Bosnia and Croatia with 'one government,
one parliament'.
The leaders of Bosnia's three warring communities at partition talks in
Geneva have already endorsed the creation of three republics, but Mr
Krajisnik's remarks indicate that, despite their formal agreement, Serb
leaders have no intention of backing the accord.
'Demarcation between national communities in Bosnia will be created soon and
the Bosnian Serb Republic and the Republic of Serb Krajina will create a
common state by the second half of 1994 at the latest,' Mr Krajisnik told
the Serb 'parliament' which met to debate whether to give the negotiating
team a new mandate at talks in Geneva.
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has exerted pressure on his Bosnian
proxies to hand over land to their Moslem adversaries in exchange for the
easing of sanctions imposed on Belgrade 19 months ago for its role in the
partition of Bosnia.
Serbian authorities yesterday announced power cuts after coal miners went on
strike demanding their wages in hard currency. The miners at the Kolubara
mining basin on Wednesday stopped all coal deliveries to the Nikola Tesla
thermal power plant, which supplies half of Serbia's electricity. Diplomats
say Serbia still sells electricity to neighbouring countries in exchange for
hard currency.
Printing presses cannot keep up with inflation, which economists yesterday
said ran at 1m per cent in December, according to Belgrade radio.
Buses carrying 800 civilians evacuated from Sarajevo limped across the
Bosnian border into Croatia yesterday, Reuter adds. The buses left the city
on Tuesday after months of haggling between Moslem authorities and besieging
Bosnian Serbs.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Russia's debt accords lapse: Western governments and banks
must await events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's debt rescheduling arrangements with western governments lapse today
amid confusion over Russian reform intentions.
In April, the Paris Club of creditor governments rescheduled over 10 years
more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn) of the Dollars 20bn in capital and
interest due in 1993. But no arrangements have been made to reschedule some
Dollars 16bn due in 1994 as well as additional arrears on payments which
should have been made last year after the rescheduling.
The April agreement was also conditional on Russia concluding a standby
agreement with the International Monetary Fund by October - another
condition which has not been met, and is unlikely to be met in the near
future.
Both the debt and the standby issue are likely to remain in limbo at least
until a new Russian government and central bank chairman are confirmed next
month following the reformists' defeat in the parliamentary elections.
Western governments, anxious to support reforms but keen for clues on how
President Boris Yeltsin intends to proceed, have little choice but to wait
upon Russia's next move.
Separate talks on rescheduling Dollars 25bn owed to western commercial banks
have failed to produce any long-term rescheduling, leading instead to a
series of 90-day rollovers. The latest of those postponements also expired
today, but was in recent days replaced by a new rollover expiring on March
31, 1994.
'We received a communication from Russia asking us to roll over (the debt)
which we did because having no agreement in place would allow individual
banks to proceed to attach assets,' said one western banker. Some trading
firms have taken action to freeze Russian assets but this has not been
emulated by banks, which hope a united front will help recover loans in
future.
They have all but stopped lending to Russia since 1991, when Moscow began
defaulting on debts incurred by the former Soviet Union.
A tentative deal, whereby Russia would start repaying commercial banks in
the final quarter of 1993, fell through after Moscow rejected a crucial
condition set by western bankers for a long-term rescheduling of the Dollars
26bn owed to them.
This condition required the state, rather than government, to guarantee the
agreement - thereby enabling banks to claim state assets if the rescheduling
was not respected.
Some reformers have suggested a partial debt write-off such as that won by
Poland when it began radical market reforms. But this has been rejected by
Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, who has sole charge of debt
negotiations, and by western governments and bankers who say Russia is rich
enough to pay its debts.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist victor of recent
parliamentary elections has advocated stopping all debt payments - like
Hitler, who unilaterally cancelled German debt repayments in 1934, and
Lenin, who disavowed all Tsarist debts after the Bolsheviks seized power in
Russia.
Laurie Morse adds from Chicago: The US State Department said yesterday it
had received a final payment of Dollars 147.4m from Russia to cover defaults
on US-backed grain loans and that payments were now up to date. However,
Russia, which had been in default since November 1992, must continue to
maintain payments due for 1994 and it is not clear if the country will soon
become eligible for new US credits.

The Russian defence minister's call for a reversal of cuts agreed for the
armed forces may be part of a personal campaign to keep his job, but may
also signal a shift in Russian policy, diplomats said yesterday, writes
Leyla Boulton.
General Pavel Grachev announced on Wednesday that he would ask the new
Russian parliament to reconsider a ceiling of 1.5m men for the year 2000.
Gen Grachev is said to be at the risk of losing his job in a government
reshuffle due next month because he has become unpopular with both President
Boris Yeltsin and the armed forces.

No other industrialised country has devised a state-run pension scheme so
generous, so abused and now so unaffordable as Italy's. If reforms had not
been introduced this year, it would have threatened to consume the entire
national budget within 20 years. As it is, the reforms have arguably been
too timid, and further changes will be necessary to reduce the flow of
public funds.
The aim of the reforms, devised by Mr Giuliano Amato's government in 1992,
was to reduce pressure on the budget by tackling the rapidly accelerating
gap between state receipts from pension contributions and annual pay-outs by
the pension institute, INPS.
An increase in contributions from either employees or employers was ruled
out as these are already high. It was estimated that it would require close
to a 50 per cent contribution from salaries to balance contributions and
payments within 30 years.
The alternative was to reduce the scope of the benefits, tailoring them to
the needs of a debt-burdened treasury. At the same time the reforms prepared
to shift the burden of pension payments away from the state and more towards
pension funds with greater individual choice for prospective pensioners.
Less than 10 per cent of pensions are currently paid outside the INPS, and
the state itself has no special system for financing pensions. Quite simply,
each year the treasury fills the gap between contributions and payments.
The changes introduced have reduced the generosity of the system in three
main ways:
By raising retirement age.
By increasing the minimum contribution period.
By extending the period for computing pensionable earnings.
Steps have also been taken to cut down on fraud, the most notable area being
disability pensions. Almost a quarter of the 16.5m state pensioners are
receiving such pensions. This is a percentage out of all proportion to the
experience of other European Union countries, and the explanation, accepted
by INPS officials, is widespread fraud.
The retirement age for men is being raised gradually from 60 to 65 years and
that for women from 55 to 60 years. The only exception will be some
categories of workers in arduous jobs like mining. At present, the process
will be completed by 2003. But it is possible that the timescale will be
accelerated to cut costs.
Retirement benefits are also being harmonised to eliminate the excessive
privileges enjoyed by public sector employers. Until now, they have had
access to so-called 'baby pensions'. This has enabled them to draw
retirement pensions irrespective of age, after short periods of work. In the
case of women, this is often less than 20 years, and a recent study showed
85 per cent of all civil servants retire early.
The reforms are gradually bringing public sector employees into line with
the private sector requirement. This envisages a minimum of 35 years of
contributions to draw a pension before the usual retirement age. On an
equally gradual basis, the minimum requirement for contributions towards
pension entitlement will be raised from 15 to 20 years. This is expected to
increase the level of contributions.
The third area of reduced generosity concerns a new definition of
pensionable earnings. Until now, Italians have been able to compute
pensionable earnings on average adjusted earnings over the five years
previous to the retirement date. This will now be gradually raised to cover
the previous 10 years' earnings as in France, and for those with under 15
years' contributions their earnings average will be computed over their
entire working period.
However, for the time being Italians will still be able to obtain state
pensions that pay up to 80 per cent of pensionable earnings, compared to 50
per cent in France.
These changes have been strongly resisted by an increasingly articulate and
militant pensioners' lobby. However, the burden on the treasury is such that
it would surprising if more changes were not introduced.
In this year's budget the government has been obliged to pay L60,000bn
(Pounds 6.7bn) to bridge the gap between contributions and payments. In
1994, the figure will rise to L72,000bn, well above projected inflation.
With the pension population increasing, the savings from the reforms will
not provide sufficient budgetary relief.
The biggest new burden is the large number of deals being struck, mainly
with state-run industries, for early retirement to shed labour peacefully.
Some 25,000 have been covered by early retirement deals this year.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Chorus of discontent grows in Romania: Government has
survived, but only just
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Romania's minority government scraped through a no-confidence motion just
before Christmas with a margin of 13 votes. But the closeness of the voting
and the growing chorus of discontent means that pressure will continue to
mount for the government to find solutions to the country's serious economic
problems.
Pro-reform opposition parties lodged the motion on grounds that the weak,
left-wing, minority government had blocked economic reform, failed to
control inflation or find an adequate exchange rate policy. They also
accused the government of allowing state monopolies and corruption to
strangle the economy during its one year in office.
The vote took place against a backdrop of warning strikes and the biggest
street demonstrations in three years. Trade union leaders backed the
opposition motion and are threatening to call a general strike in
mid-January if their demands for faster privatisation, higher pay and
reforms of the social security system are not met.
The opposition went ahead with the motion in spite of the government's
recent breakthrough with the International Monetary Fund after months of
negotiation. Many reformers doubt that the government led by the Party of
Social Democracy in Romania, which relies on nationalists and former
Communist parties to stay in power, has the will or ability to implement the
package of reforms agreed with the IMF and World Bank.
'The government has two faces, like Janus. It says one thing to the IMF and
World Bank and another at home which has led to contradictory policies. It
has shown clearly over the past year that it is against reform. Its aim is
to keep the status quo and to protect state property,' says Mr Varujan
Vosganian, an opposition MP.
Others hope an agreement with the IMF, which would unlock Dollars 700m
(Pounds 470m) of badly-needed loans from the Fund over the next 18 months,
will give a new impetus to reformers within the government. The reform camp
is now led by Mr Mircea Cosea, the economic reform minister. He is leading
the battle against conservatives headed by the prime minister, Mr Nicolae
Vacaroiu, a Communist-era official who spent the last years of the Ceausescu
regime working at the central economic planning committee.
With the economy in a worst state than that of any other in central Europe
(outside former Yugoslavia) there appear to be few tolerable alternatives to
rapid implementation of the reform programme.
The priority is to prevent the country from slipping into hyperinflation.
Consumer price inflation rose from 200 per cent in 1992 to 314 per cent in
the year to October. The delay in imposing financial discipline on
highly-indebted state concerns is one reason for high inflation. But many
economists say the chief cause in recent months has been the population's
expectation of continuous price rises which has also further reduced
confidence in the leu, the national currency, creating a dangerous spiral.
Another key aim of the programme is to allow the leu to float early next
year. The government's refusal to liberalise the exchange rate pushed the
black market rate to 1,700 to the dollar from 600 at the beginning of the
year, and kept more than 80 per cent of hard currency transactions in the
parallel economy, according to central bank officials.
The government has also assured the IMF and World Bank that it will
accelerate privatisation after a year in which the authorities sold off only
220 small companies, compared with a target of 800-1,000. They also failed
to liquidate a single bankrupt medium-sized or large state enterprise.
Such measures are essential if Romania is to gain the confidence of foreign
investors and attract the capital and know-how needed to turn round its
economy.
This year's delay in undertaking reform has led to a drop in direct foreign
investment. Only Dollars 205m has been committed compared with Dollars 270m
in 1992, according to Romanian Development Agency figures.
The government must also move quickly to boost public morale. The tens of
thousands of weary Romanians who have recently protested on the streets are
in sharp contrast to the jubilant crowds which four years ago overthrew
Nicolae Ceausescu. Real wages have fallen by 45 per cent since 1989,
according to official statistics, and as living standards continue to drop,
many show nostalgia for what seems like the security of the past.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Lifeline thrown to Italian state groups
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Ciampi government has thrown an end-of-year lifeline to financially
troubled state groups by introducing a mechanism to reschedule high interest
debt.
The main beneficiary will be Iri, the state holding company, which is close
to collapse with L80,000bn (Pounds 31.6bn) of debt and expected 1993 losses
of L10,000bn. However, other groups such as Eni, the state oil concern, and
Enel, the state electricity authority, could also benefit.
The measure was approved in the form of a decree late on Wednesday night at
the end of a long cabinet meeting that also endorsed new fiscal measures to
raise an extra L6,780bn (Pounds 2.7bn) for the 1994 budget.
The debt rescheduling mechanism permits the treasury's financial arm, the
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, to issue state-backed paper in the name of
wholly-owned state companies. This paper, issued at market rates, can then
be swapped with bank loans.
A treasury spokesman pointed out that state companies had been borrowing at
rates of 15-16 per cent from banks, although they were formally backed by a
state guarantee. The treasury has yet to decide what form the financial
instruments will take, but officials pointed out that interest rates would
be around 8 per cent in current market conditions. This would involve a
substantial saving in Iri's present financial charges.
No figure has been fixed for the size of this rescheduling, but yesterday
there were suggestions the treasury would issue at first some L10,000bn in
favour of Iri and its subsidiaries. Such measures would save Iri more than
L5,000bn in debt service.
Despite obtaining L1,850bn from this month's privatisation of its 67 per
cent stake in Credito Italiano, Iri's finances are in desperate shape and
the group will need to find more funds early next year to finance the
restructuring of Alitalia, the state airline, and the sell-off of the Ilva
steel group. Cleaning up Ilva for privatisation is likely to cost L4,000bn.
Treasury officials insist that the measures do not infringe existing
agreements with the European Commission over state subsidies. The government
feels it has finally patched up its relations with Brussels in deals over
Efim, the state industrial holding in liquidation, and over Ilva, the latter
being concluded just before Christmas.
The government was allowed in July to refinance the debt of state companies
but undertook not to increase the overall level of debt outstanding at the
end of 1993. The new measures will not increase the total debt stock of
state companies, nor will they weigh upon the budget deficit.
The treasury said yesterday the government was anxious to see the debt
rescheduling mechanism operational as soon as possible.
The measures attracted some hostile comment in the press on the grounds that
they smacked of continued state interventionism at a time when the
government was seeking to privatise. However, the decree seems to be the
least interventionist way of bringing about a quick improvement in Iri's
potentially disastrous finances, which in turn will help the privatisation
process.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Italy's Inflation continues to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's annualised inflation rate fell to 4 per cent in December, the lowest
level in 24 years, writes Robert Graham. According to Istat, the national
statistics office, consumer prices registered zero growth in December, as
part of a continuing downward trend in the overall level of inflation. The
potential inflationary effects of the devaluation of the lira have been
offset by depressed domestic demand. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime
minister, predicted earlier this week that inflation could be at an
annualised rate of 2.5 per cent by the end of 1994.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Kohl takes a sober view of the new year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today said Germany was moving out of recession, but
tempered his optimistic forecasts for the new year with warnings of more
spending cut-backs, and a slow recovery in the labour market.
In his annual new year's eve television address, and an article in the
end-of-year issue of Handelsblatt, the economics daily, Mr Kohl identified
unemployment as the most worrying single issue among Germans.
By the end of the year, 8.7 per cent of the labour force, or 3.44m people
will be unemployed - the highest levels since the second world war. They
include 2.28m from western Germany and over 1.16m from the eastern states.
Mr Kohl said a package of radical reforms at the work - place was needed to
help guarantee existing jobs, create new ones, and improve Germany's
competitiveness.
'Securing the future forces us to make more cuts. . . what we need is
courage and realism, initiative and confidence,' he said.
In a sober broadcast, and reflective article, the chancellor gave priority
to domestic issues, instead of focusing on European Union affairs as in
previous speeches this year. The shift reflected his agenda for next year's
marathon round of state and parliamentary elections.
Mr Kohl insisted that the government's two-track strategy of reforms in
western Germany and large financial transfers to eastern Germany would
ultimately create jobs and counteract the social costs of unification. But
he warned that even after the recovery it would 'take a considerably longer
time until positive aspects are felt on the labour market'.
He explained that one of the reasons for Germany's lack of competitiveness,
and consequent high unemployment, was a sense of delusion about the
effectiveness of the country's social and economic structures, which
postponed any fundamental discussion about reforms. 'The creation of 3m jobs
over the past years tempted us into believing there was no need to become
more competitive,' he said.
He added that the recipe for competitiveness hinged on the workplace, a
theme the government has constantly repeated over the past year. He said
reforms would include 'flexibility in working hours, and particularly more
job sharing', underpinned by reducing costs.

The rise in French unemployment slowed sharply in November, increasing by
3,200 to 3.29m, the labour ministry announced yesterday. The unemployment
rate at the end of the month was stable at 12 per cent of the workforce.
A ministry official said the figures showed the effects of government
measures to encourage training schemes and part-time employment. But he said
that the rate of unemployment was likely to increase further.
This view was echoed by private sector economists. 'The rate of increase has
slackened but we are likely to see further rises in unemployment until the
second half of next year,' said Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at Morgan
Guaranty.
The slowing in the rise of unemployment in November partly reflected a
reduced number of job losses in the services sector. Economists said that it
also represented a correction from the sharp increase in October, when the
rate jumped from 11.8 per cent to 12 per cent.
November's unemployment figures are the latest in a series of statistics
which suggest that the economy has endured the worst of its sharp recession.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, argues that the economy is now
stabilising and is due to expand by about 1.4 per cent next year in terms of
gross domestic product.
The French environment minister, Mr Michel Barnier, yesterday called for an
extraordinary EU meeting to review sea transport rules following the
littering of France's western coast by explosives and pesticides washed up
on shore, Reuter reports from Paris.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Kinkel stresses links with east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, yesterday said greater security
and economic links between the European Union and the Nato alliance must be
extended to the countries of eastern Europe and Russia.
In an end-of-year foreign policy statement, Mr Kinkel said the EU, and
Germany in particular, must strengthen the region's security, economic and
democratic structures through more intensive relations. 'It should be our
goal to build up our relations with our eastern neighbours as intensively
and confidently as we have done over the past decades,' he said.
However, Mr Willy Claes, his Belgian counterpart, said a more hurried
approach to Nato membership for eastern European countries would cause
serious trouble for Russian reformers, adding that Nato membership for
countries such as Poland and Hungary was 'not for tomorrow'.
The ministers' views reflect a fundamental debate within the EU and Nato on
how best to consolidate reforms in both central Europe and Russia, which is
likely to figure high on Nato's agenda when it meets on January 10.
Mr Kinkel's statement also reflects concern, particularly in the
Chancellery, that if the EU does not adhere to the timetable in admitting
the Nordic countries and Austria, then prospects of opening up full
membership to the countries of eastern Europe will fade and disillusionment
among the young democracies will set in.
'If the expansion (of the EU to include the Nordic countries and Austria)
runs into difficulties, it would be a hard blow to the prospects of
membership for other states for which we have held out hope.'

FT  31 DEC 93 / Balladur calls for EU action against 'unfair' trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS and DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union should use its new-found unity over trade to push for
protection against unfair foreign competition which is based on lower wages,
currency rates and environmental standards, according to Mr Edouard
Balladur, France's prime minister.
Speaking in a year-end interview with the Financial Times, which today names
him its Man of the Year for 1993, Mr Balladur said: 'If we do not resolve
these social, environmental and monetary problems, we will perforce have
major distortions of competition and uprooting of companies' in western
Europe.
Mr Balladur, who showed himself ready to bring the Uruguay Round of the Gatt
negotiations to the brink of failure before winning substantial concessions
for France and its EU partners, said that Gatt demonstrated to Europeans
that 'we're stronger together than if we were alone', but that 'it is
important to know what you want'. 'All of us west Europeans . . . have lived
since the Renaissance, or at least since the beginning of the colonial
epoch, a bit like the rentiers (the privileged) of the world. This has
enabled us to build up systems of social protection which are very necessary
but very costly', he said.
The big challenge for the EU, in addition to creating prosperity and
stability in east Europe, was whether this could be preserved 'in a world in
which competition has become so lively', Mr Balladur said. The French
premier, who is now the front-runner - though undeclared candidate - for his
country's 1995 presidential election, made clear France would try to use the
new World Trade Organisation which Paris championed as a replacement for
Gatt to restrain market forces.
'Can we (West Europeans) take it for granted that we will remain sufficient
leaders in a sufficient number of sectors to survive - in the face of
countries with populations infinitely larger than ours and with levels of
social protection infinitely smaller?' he asked. 'I say we should leave this
to the market, but only up to a certain point. What is the market? It is the
law of the jungle, the law of nature. And what is civilisation? It is the
struggle against nature.' Addressing the problem of record French
unemployment, Mr Balladur said he had no intention of reducing France's
relatively high minimum wage blamed by some economists for pricing the
less-skilled out of jobs. Nor did he have any regrets about conceding to Air
France strikers. He had decided that in loading disproportionate pay cuts on
lower-paid airline staff, the plan (for bonus cuts and redundancies) was too
unjust to be worth persevering with.

The new board at Banco Espanol de Credito installed by the Bank of Spain
after it dismissed Mr Mario Conde as president, plans to keep Banesto
independent and is likely to try to raise fresh capital.
A member of the five-man board now running Spain's fourth-largest bank said
it hoped to publish a restructuring plan early in the new year, which could
include a temporary equity injection from other big Spanish banks. Banesto
raised Dollars 775m of new equity this year before its problems emerged.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, told a parliamentary
committee yesterday that the removal of the former Banesto board on Tuesday
was triggered by the discovery of a Pta500bn (Pounds 2.38bn) overvaluation
of the bank's Dollars 61bn assets in an inspection made in September.
He said the inspection had found that the bank's rush to increase market
share between 1988 and 1991 had burdened it with a dangerously high level of
doubtful and non-performing loans. Banesto's loans rose by 109 per cent in
that period, compared with just 55 per cent at other large Spanish banks.
The potential deficit includes the underfunding of a pension scheme -
thought to amount to Pta80bn - and a revaluation of its industrial
portfolio. The scale of the loan problems emerged when inspectors began
examining loans of Pta250m and upwards compared with an earlier threshold of
Pta750m.
Although Banesto has only Dollars 2.8bn of equity and so would be unable to
absorb the whole revaluation immediately, Mr Rojo said it would be able to
phase any adjustment of its assets. He also said that fresh capital could be
raised by selling more industrial holdings.
'The bank has clear prospects to advance but only to the extent that its
current weakness is overcome with the explicit support of the entire Spanish
banking system', Mr Rojo said. But he did not give details of how Banesto
would be restructured, or whether it would be taken over.
The Banesto board member said the bank had not yet decided to retain as a
corporate finance adviser JP Morgan, the US commercial bank which advised Mr
Conde on this year's capital increase. JP Morgan has also invested Dollars
175m in Banesto equity.
The board member said Banesto would try to keep intact its core banking
business. But it might try to raise capital by disposing of its remaining
equity stakes in industrial companies.
Banesto may ask other banks for new equity, which could be later floated,
and may try to raise fresh capital from issuing subordinated debt.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Vocational schooling urged for 14-year-olds: Dearing report
to recommend mix of technical and academic study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schoolchildren of 14 should be able to begin vocational courses designed to
keep them in full-time education until the age of 19, Sir Ron Dearing will
recommend next week in his report on the national curriculum in England and
Wales.
Sir Ron, who was commissioned in April to review the curriculum, wants
14-year-olds to be allowed to opt for a programme of vocational education,
although they would continue to study a 'core' of academic subjects, such as
English, mathematics and science.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, is not obliged to accept the report,
but within Whitehall it was confirmed that 'this concept will not be
difficult for ministers', who are already examining possibilities for
implementation within a few years.
A move to allow vocational courses at an earlier age than now would bring
British education closer to the standard practice in continental Europe.
Concern at Britain's weakness in non-academic education was heightened last
week by Mr John Major, prime minister, who said in an interview with The
Daily Telegraph that 'the top 15 per cent of the youngsters who come out of
our schools are the equal of anything you will find anywhere in the world.
The other 85 per cent frankly are not'.
Officials of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, which Sir Ron
chairs, stressed that the recommended reforms are aimed at the pupils 'who
are deemed failures on the academic side', those about whom Mr Major is most
worried.
The officials say the reforms will be intended 'to deal with a major
national failing which is the lack of the technical education in which Japan
and Germany and our other competitors specialise'.
Sir Ron's aims are 'medium-term'. The proposals are not intended to be
introduced for several years.
Schools would be required to build closer links with further education
colleges in another development that the government would encourage.
Officials said the move would raise the status of vocational education.
Ministers have noticed that in some further education colleges, up to 80 per
cent of candidates for the new general national vocational qualifications,
aimed at pupils aged between 16 and 18, are also taking A-levels.

FT  31 DEC 93 / Industrial leaders and MPs dominate new year honours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politicians, captains of industry and top civil servants have again
dominated the leading awards in the New Year's Honours List, despite the
prime minister's recent call for a broader range of individuals to be
decorated.
As part of his mission to create a 'classless society', Mr John Major said
that the biannual honours lists should increasingly reflect exceptional
achievement rather than status, with more awards going to people who have
done voluntary work and fewer to state servants.
However, although this new year's list contains a larger number of awards
for voluntary workers than previously, most of the top decorations have
again gone to leading public figures and company chief executives.
Moreover, less than a quarter of the list is made up of individuals who have
been nominated by a member of the public, under a scheme launched by the
prime minister in March.
Downing Street officials said yesterday that the public had recommended
about 7,500 individuals for a decoration. But only 200 of the 900 awards
made today were backed by the public - and in only 70 cases were awards
generated solely by an external nomination. Officials said they were still
scrutinising about 4,000 of the original nominations, but they expected the
number to increase in future years. The awards to industrialists reflect a
greater admiration for Britain's established companies rather than for the
acquisitive conglomerates singled out in Lady Thatcher's honours lists in
the 1980s.
Mr Iain Vallance, the chairman of BT, is one of five leading business
figures to receive a knighthood. The others are Mr Michael Perry, the
chairman of Unilever, Mr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo Holdings,
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of the Midland Bank and Mr Ian Wood,
managing director of John Wood group, an offshore oil company regarded as
one of Scotland's fastest growing corporations.
Sir David Nickson, chairman of the Clydesdale Bank and former president of
the Confederation of British Industry, is one of only two new life peers in
the list. The other is Sir Patrick Wright, a former head of the Diplomatic
Service.
Mr Archie Hamilton, the former minister for the armed forces and a former
parliamentary private secretary to Lady Thatcher, is one of three MPs to be
knighted for political service. The other two are Mr Peter Fry, Tory MP for
Wellingborough, and Mr David Madel, Tory MP for Bedfordshire South West.
Mr Kenneth Warren, former Tory MP and chairman of the all-party trade and
industry select committee, also receives a knighthood. Mr Gus O'Donnell, the
prime minister's press secretary who is due to leave next year, is made a
Companion of the Order of the Bath. The Labour party has again not put
forward any MPs in protest at the system.
Leading the awards in the world of arts are Dame Janet Baker, the opera
singer, who is made a Companion of Honour and Mr Derek Jacobi, the actor,
who is knighted.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Russia to do more for poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday proposed higher social spending next year
following the strong showing of the far-right in elections this month,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Gennady Melikyan, the labour minister, said social spending would rise
from 9 to 13 per cent of gross national product.
Russian reformers have become sensitive to improving the lot of ordinary
people following the success of the ultra-nationalist party of Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a first deputy prime minister, said the government
would increase income tax on high earners to pay for help for the poor.
'Because the gap between the poor and the rich is rapidly growing, the
government has prepared new tax regulations,' he said.
The prime minister Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin and other reformers have
interpreted Mr Zhirinovsky's success as a protest vote against economic
hardship caused by radical market reforms rather than as a genuine swell in
extreme nationalist feeling.
Mr Chernomyrdin has indicated his government would now focus less on tight
monetary policy and more on investments to create jobs.
The government will have to look for ways of funding more social spending
without compromising its plans for a tough budget next year aimed at curbing
the deficit.

FT  30 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dutch stocks flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A flat market in a flat country held back two Dutch-related stocks. In the
two and a half trading days that the London market was closed the Amsterdam
CBS Tendency Index was held back by options related business and German
selling.
As a result, magazine publisher Reed International, the UK-quoted element of
Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier fell 13 to 894p. Unilever, the
Anglo-Dutch food group, fell 2 to 1213p.
However, Shell Transport, the UK component of Royal Dutch Shell, rose 5 to
723p. She is seen as the safe haven in a perilous sector dogged by falling
oil prices and the obvious choice for fund managers needing to maintain a
sector weighting.
US investors remained unmoved by prospects that Reuters Holdings, the news
and electronic information group, might buy the Globex share dealing system
and continued to sell the stock.
Overseas selling meant that by the start of trading in London yesterday,
US-traded American Depositary Receipts were priced at the equivalent of
1837p. The UK shares were marked down accordingly and were virtually flat
until the late afternoon when further US selling drove them down again to
end the day a net 36 lower at 1828p.
Banks stocks were driven sharply higher by a combination of a squeeze on
marketmakers' short positions, increasing hopes of another reduction in UK
interest rates and optimism over an improvement in the UK housing market.
The latter was emphasised by a report from the Halifax building society
which forecast a five per cent rise in house prices in the UK next year.
The steep rise in the Hong Kong market over the Christmas period was said to
have propelled HSBC shares 36 to 946p and helped push Standard Chartered 16
firmer to 1247p.
Lloyds Bank was the pick of the other bank stocks, closing 26 better at
684p, closely followed by Abbey National, 22 to the good at 518p, NatWest
which settled 20 1/2 up at 628p and Barclays rose 12 to 645p.
TSB was a lone weak spot in the sector, closing 2 easier at 244p as recent
buyers of the shares, primarily on hopes of early news of asset sales and on
growing optimism about the bank's January 13 preliminary figures, switched
into other banks. Insurance stocks were left behind by the market's upsurge.
Euro Disney shares, savaged on the Paris Bourse during London's closure,
plummeted to a record low of 328p before stabilising and closing 15 off at
358p; turnover in London was a paltry 78,000 shares. Dealers said the stock
price had been mauled by suggestions that banks were being offered Euro
Disney debt at a substantial discount and by rumours that the group's parent
company, Walt Disney, was beginning to distance itself from Euro Disney's
financial problems.
Attempts to drive the share prices of many of the FT - SE 100 constituents
higher to help activities in the derivatives areas of the market were said
to have involved Allied Lyons, which shot up 28 to a peak 693p on turnover
of 2.5m.
News that Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, will hold on to its
40 per cent stake in Wellcome for the time being added to general enthusiasm
for the internationally traded stock which closed 16 higher at 667p. There
had been worries of a glut of stock coming into the market and depressing
the share price.
Fisons, which recently sacked its chief executive and announced closures and
redundancies to restore shareholder confidence, bounced 15 to 128p following
an end of year newspaper recommendation.
Demand for British Steel sent the shares up 4 1/2 to 127p on economic
recovery hopes.
Pulp and newsprint group Bowater fell 14 to 469p on continued profit-taking.
An announcement that the British and French governments had agreed to extend
their concession on the Channel Tunnel to Eurotunnel, the operator, came
after the market closed but the shares had already lifted 23 to 563p.
In spite of their yield attractions, shares in international conglomerate
Hanson managed failed to participate in London's stock market surge and rose
only a penny to 273 1/2 p.

FT  30 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Christmas sales lift stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in leading high street retailers streaked ahead yesterday as
speculators became increasingly convinced that the run up to Christmas and
initial indications from post Christmas sales may be pointers to a
significant upturn in consumer spending. The food retailing sector, the
market's worst performing area this year, also shared in the upsurge.
Store shares have consistently underperformed the wider market recently but
began to stir last week as some of the market's action funds - which take
advantage of perceived short-term market opportunities - took out small bull
positions ahead of official sales news from the big groups.
Analysts were reluctant to adopt any significant stance on sales figures but
said initial indications were good and an early reduction in UK interest
rates would provide further ammunition for fund managers to move into the
sectors in strength. There was an element of caution from some areas,
however; 'The real danger for this sector will come when the companies issue
official statements on trading. An inkling of bad news will see the sector
down five per cent at a stroke,' said one retailing specialist.
Marketmakers, on the other hand, adopted a more positive view and hoisted
share prices throughout a busy session. GUS, the sector best performer
during 1993, raced up 19 1/2 to 654p while Kingfisher leapt 36 to 778p on
keen turnover of 3.3m. Marks &amp; Spencer surged 20 to a record 460p - the
biggest single day's gain in the stock since the Conservative's general
election victory in April 1992 - on turnover of 3.8m. Boots climbed 26 to
605p.
However, W H Smith 'A' stubbornly refused to join the party, the shares
closing 4 off at 514p, bedevilled by concerns about the Do-It-All business.
Hopes of bumper Christmas sales in food retailing were focused clearly on J.
Sainsbury, which raced up 17 to 455p and Kwik Save, 26 better at 618p.
Argyll was left behind and unmoved at 277p while Asda managed a 2 1/2 gain
at 57 1/2 p.

FT  30 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures continued to provide a strong lead for the stock market
yesterday, although traders were quick to point out that, at 10,592
contracts in the March FT-SE contract, turnover was relatively thin, writes
Terry Byland.
The contract closed at a premium of 20 points to the cash market, around 2
points to the fair value premium which allows for dividend flows and
carrying costs on the underlying stocks.
Futures traders characterised yesterday's performance by derivates as
'taking the line of least resistance': strong gains in continental European
markets earlier this week, while London was closed, vied with renewed
optimism for lower interest rates and further economic recovery in the UK as
stimulating factors for the market.
There were some fears that a batch of Over-The-Counter, or individually
structured futures programmes might expire before the year-end, but since
such deals are agreed privately between clients and securities houses,
nothing could be proved yesterday.
Turnover of 33,456 contracts in traded options compared with 17,367 in the
half session on Christmas Eve. The FT-SE contract trade 15.073 yesterday and
the Euro FT-SE headed the individual contracts list.
Interest rate related stocks took pride of place in the active stocks list
following reports on Christmas trading at the big name retailers. Marks &amp;
Spencer (2,058 contracts), and Abbey National (1,852) were immediate
beneficiaries and Land Securities (1,401) and National Westminster Bank
(1,030) attracted significant interest.

FT  30 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Peaks on the Footsie in
post-Christmas trading - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New peaks were scaled in the London stock market yesterday as traders
returned from the Christmas break to find that their pre-holiday optimism
had been outpaced by stock markets in the Far Eastern and other global
investment centres. The FT-SE 100 Share Index jumped a further 49.7 points
to a new closing high of 3,462; the Index ended well below the intra-day
peak of 3,474.2, however, when Wall Street opened slowly and US investors
left London alone.
Confidence in economic recovery in the UK was encouraged by reports of a
late surge in business at shops and travel agents in the UK, and the stock
market continued to look for a cut in base rates in the New Year. However,
some analysts now suggest that a base rate cut may be held back until the
spring when domestic consumers will feel the bite of the Budget tax
increases.
Once again, share prices were pushed ahead by renewed buying of the March
contract on the Footsie which broke through 3,500 at one time.
The merciless squeeze on marketmaker's positions also continued and traders
commented that, while the day's Seaq total of 479.3m shares was modest, it
would have been much larger had stock been more readily available.
Interest was seen from European sources, with buyers from Germany picking up
such retail leaders as Kingfisher and Marks &amp; Spencer. But the UK
institutions were clearly operating at no more than half speed, with many
fund management desks only half-staffed.
It was the absence of US interest, however, that took the wind out of the
London market towards the close. UK analysts fear that upward pressures on
interest rates may re-appear on Wall Street in the near future. Optimism on
domestic interest rates brought hopes in some quarters that the Bundesbank
may set a lead at its next council meeting.
Investors in London brushed off two potentially disturbing factors, in the
form of growing concern over prospects for a refinancing of Euro Disney, and
the dismissal, by the Spanish central bank, of the board of Banco Espanol de
Credito. News of developments at Eurotunnel came after trading closed in
London.
The strongest gains came among the bank shares which have been leading the
London market throughout the latest bull phase on the expectation that
higher dividends will be prompted by the improvement to balance sheets
following falling interest rates. However, the sector was featured by HSBC
which was responding to strength in the Far East.
Store and retail shares, which have moved uncertainly as the stock market
waited for news on the Christmas selling season, rose sharply on widespread
reports of heavy business as the winter sales got under way.
Private investor interest across the market pushed the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
ahead by 33.8 to a new peak of 3,807. Stock Exchange data disclosed that the
half session on Christmas Eve brought a total of 249.9m shares, which were
worth Pounds 560.6m in retail worth. Christmas week brought retail business
worth Pounds 7bn in UK equities, a high level for a pre-holiday period. It
also continued the run of profitable trading in equities for UK securities
houses which has featured the past eighteen months, and has been reflected
in high bonus payments for successful market traders and analysts.

FT  30 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow advances as new year is
awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
For the second consecutive day US share prices traded close to their opening
values as dealers and investors waited for the holiday week to end and a new
trading year to start in earnest, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.56 at 3,794.33, a
new record high. The more broadly based Standard&amp; Poor's 500 finished down
0.36 at 470.58. Secondary indices put in a more robust performance, with the
Amex composite ending up 2.16 at 472.16, and the Nasdaq composite up 3.92 at
768.48. Trading volume was 283m shares. Prices firmed at the start as
investors reacted to more positive news on the economy. The good news was a
0.5 per cent increase in the November leading economic indicators, and a 29
per cent rise in November existing home sales. The data was sufficient to
push the Dow close to 3,800, but by mid-morning, weakness among oil stocks,
notably Chevron and Exxon, brought the Dow back from its early highs.
The strengthening economy, combined with low interest rates and the
expectation that share prices would end the year on a positive note as they
usually do, were all working in the market's favour, and keeping stocks at
or close to record highs.
The selling in the oil sector was the main story in a featureless day,
although the declines were not widespread. Exxon fell Dollars  3/8 at
Dollars 63&lt;5/8, Chevron Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 88, and British Petroleum,
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 64 3/4 , some oil stocks escaped the sell-off.
Phillips Petroleum rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 29 1/8 , and Mobil rose
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 79 1/8 . The latter was probably helped by the news
that the company had sold off four pipeline systems, closed 10 product
storage terminals and cut its domestic marine fleet by 33 per cent as part
of a year-long streamlining of its US distribution system.
Airline stocks underperformed after the brokerage house, Prudential
Securities, cut its rating of Delta Air Lines stock from 'buy' to 'hold'.
Delta fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 5/8 , UAL gave up Dollars 2 1/8 at
Dollars 146, AMR, parent of American Airlines, slipped Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 67 3/8 , while USAir eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 3/4 .
CompUSA jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 3/4 on the news that the
technology goods retailer's same-store sales had risen 13 per cent in its
second fiscal quarter.
On the Nasdaq market, Intel gave up some of Tuesday's gains, slipping
Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 63 1/8. Other big technology stocks were also weaker,
with Apple down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 28 1/2, and Microsoft off Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 81 1/2.
Canada
Toronto stocks hit a record high in continued light trading. The TSE-300
composite index gained 21.07 points, or 0.49 per cent, to 4,309.92,
surpassing the previous record high of 4307.67 set on Dec. 8.
Advances led declines 408 to 269. Volume was 34.50m shares compared with
35.49m.
Hollinger's American Publishing Co. unit purchased 33 publications from Park
Communications Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Hollinger shares were
unchanged at CDollars 14. AGRA Industries reported much higher net income
from continuing operations in the first quarter. Its A shares fell CDollars
1/8 to CDollars 9 7/8.

FT  30 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid depressed by Banesto
upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses had a mixed day, writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID fell another 1.5 per cent, dragged down by negative sentiment after
the Bank of Spain's decision to take control of the management in Banesto.
Banks suffered again, with BCH Pta195, or 6.1 per cent, lower at Pta3,105
and BBV down Pta190, or 5.8 per cent, at Pta3,075. Turnover was an active
Pta43.4bn.
PARIS climbed to a new closing high with the CAC-40 index up 17.25 at
2,281.89 in turnover of FFr4.35bn. Euro Disney recovered FFr2.85, or 9.8 per
cent, to FFr31.90 on short covering after a two-day fall of FFr4.15.
FRANKFURT continued to be dominated by DTB-originated trading, following a
mini-crash in the DAX futures index on Tuesday. In the cash market, the DAX
fell another 28.12, or 1.3 per cent, to 2,214.70 yesterday, recovering to
2,229.62 in the post bourse.
Very little of this was investment business, emphasised Mr Jens Wiecking of
Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. The fall in the market, he said, was merely a
correction after Tuesday's intra-day high of 2,284.56 - and the post bourse
'recovery', again, was a matter of traders covering their short positions.
Turnover fell from DM10.5bn to DM7.9bn. Banks were relatively weak again,
Bayernverein losing DM15 at DM570 and Commerzbank DM9 at DM382.
ZURICH overcame an early continuation of Tuesday's consolidation to finish
marginally firmer with late demand sparked by Wall Street's firm opening.
The SMI indexfinished 3.3 higher at 2,934.2.
Banks remained neglected although CS Holding recovered from Tuesday's 3 per
cent fall after the share was split, the bearers adding SFr7 to SFr735.
AMSTERDAM spent a quiet session although most internationals took their lead
from London's bullish tone. The CBS Tendency index added 0.2 at 148.3.
A slightly stronger bond market cushioned a downward drift in financials,
while VNU, 30 cents ahead at Fl 174.20, was the only one of the major
publishers to escape a second day of profit-taking.
MILAN eased on profit-taking in continuing low volume and the Comit index
shed 4.10 to 613.83.
STOCKHOLM came back to life after two listless sessions, the the
Affarsvarlden index adding 21.7, or 1.6 per cent, to 1405.3. Astra A shares
rose SKr6 to a record SKr192 on the strength of technical factors and
positive press comment. Ericsson Bs rose SKr8 to SKr339 and Asea As gained
SKr11 to SKr586.
COPENHAGEN continued its steady ascent, KFX index adding 1.54 to at 108.19,
for a cumulative 4.3 per cent rise since the Christmas break.
Industrial and shipping shares did well. Three per cent rises were recorded
by AP Moeller's D/S 1912, up DKr4,000 at DKr132,000, and Sand Svendborg B,
DKr6,000 higher at DKr191,000, both supported by press reports of the sale
of Maersk's shareholding in a Hong Kong shipping terminal.
OSLO rose almost 1 per cent, helped by higher North Sea oil prices and a
stronger dollar. The all-share index added 5.70 to 615.13, with the central
bank's announcement of a rise from today in key interest rates coming after
the market closed.
HELSINKI moved firmly ahead in strong demand linked both to year-end book
squaring and to the continuing fall in interest rates. The Hex index closed
25.4, or 1.6 per cent higher, at 1,588.2.
ATHENS rose 1.6 per cent to a new high for the year, the general index
closing 14.84 higher at 950.01, mostly on news that prime lending rates will
drop by a percentage point on January 1.
TEL AVIV recovered on positive developments in talks between Israel and the
PLO in Cairo, the Mishtanim index gaining 2.31 at 248.54.

FT  30 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): More highs in region as
Nikkei extends revival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japanese equities extended the recovery which they began in Tuesday's
trading, as buying from arbitrageurs and investment trusts lifted the
market, in volatile trading, on the final full day of activity in this
calendar year, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei-225 average rose 140.82 to settle at 17,272.03, after fluctuating
between an intraday low of 17,036.30 and a high of 17,342.13. The Topix
index of all first section issues ended 2.08 higher at 1,429.27. Japanese
equity trading will end today after the morning session today.
Turnover was estimated at 220m, compared with Tuesday's final 202m. Advances
outpaced declines by 578 to 373, with 183 issues unchanged. In London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.93 to 1,182.9.
In spite of the lack of trading volume, brokers said that the day's market
sentiment reflected a lift in mood generally expected during this time of
the month. Investors had widely hoped for a grand finale. The year-end
finish was far from grand, but did result in positive territory, and
moderately above the year-end finish of 1992, which was 16,924.95.
Pressed and crisp, traders on the Tokyo Stock Exchange followed the
tradition of applauding on the final day of stock transactions, but clearly
there was scant reason for celebration. The Nikkei-225 average's overall
performance for the year was lacklustre at best, and the key barometer still
remains more than 50 per cent below its all-time peak of 38,915.87 posted in
late 1989.
On the trading floor, the automobile sector received a boost on reports of a
proposed consumption tax cut for car purchases. Toyota ended Y30 higher at
Y1,780, Honda advanced Y20 to Y1,500 and Isuzu Motors, which was one the
most actively traded issues of the session, gained Y9 to Y344.
Some consumer electronic issues were bought actively. Pioneer Electronic
climbed Y110 to Y2,770, Sony rose Y30 to Y5,510 and Victor moved Y5 higher
to Y835.
The session's gains failed to push banking shares into positive territory.
The Bank of Tokyo ended Y20 lower to Y1,470, Industrial Bank ended Y10 lower
to Y2,800 and Sumitomo Bank fell Y30 to Y1,900.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 121.08 higher to 19,085.47, in volume of
29.8m shares.
Roundup
New highs were the rule in Asia, the exception being Hong Kong which saw
profit taking. Seoul and Bombay were closed for holidays.
SINGAPORE hit a new closing high for the third day this week in record
volume, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 34.48 higher at 2,426.85
in 855m shares.
Retail investors provided the impetus, with international fund managers
divided over 1994 prospects.
MANILA peaked on the last trading day of 1993 amid forecasts of another
strong year in 1994. The composite index rose 30.43 to 3,196.08, lifted by
Philippine Long Distance Telephone and Philippine National Bank which rose
10 pesos to 2,290 and 45 to 615 respectively. Combined turnover at Manila
and Makati rose from 3.07bn pesos to 4.26bn.
TAIWAN closed at a 29-month high as the market repeated Tuesday's pattern,
with financials strong but most industrials down on profit-taking. The
weighed index closed 36.32 up at 5,538.07 in turnover of TDollars 83.04bn.
Heavy speculation was seen in financials and brokers worried that the mood,
illogically, might have developed following the finance ministry's
reimposition of a stock capital gains tax, of which details are expected by
the end of this week.
JAKARTA professionals thought that window-dressing might have helped the
official index up another 15.32 to a new high of 587.88.
KARACHI saw active buying by local institutions and foreign funds as the
KSE-100 index rose 42.21 to another new peak of 2,143.41.
AUSTRALIA closed just fractionally short of the post-1987 crash high of
2,132.4 reached on November 1, the All Ordinaries index rising 37.7 to
2,126.9 as it caught up after the Christmas break.
Blue chips were almost all firmer, with BHP up 50 cents to ADollars 16.90
and News Corp up five to ADollars 9.75.
NEW ZEALAND, also catching up with the US market, sent the NZSE-40 index up
46.79 to a nine-week high of 2,155.12. Brokers said that the steep fall in
wholesale interest rates before Christmas was also a factor.
HONG KONG dealers talked comfortably of consolidation as the Hang Seng index
closed down 120.45, or 1 per cent at 11,449.77. Turnover remained strong,
close to Tuesday's final HKDollars 9.61bn.

FT  30 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Mobile phones leave Kuala Lumpur
walking on air - The broadly based share buying frenzy that is gripping the
Malaysian market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A hairdressing salon in central Kuala Lumpur. A mobile phone rings. It
belongs to the girl with the scissors. 'Buy 1,000 at MDollars 3.50 (Dollars
1.40), sell at MDollars 5.'
It is hard to escape the share frenzy which is gripping Malaysia. The Kuala
Lumpur composite index, up 8.81 at a record 1,231.86 yesterday, has risen by
91.7 per cent this year. The retail market, rather than local or foreign
institutional buyers, are leading the headlong stock market charge.
Mr Michael Greenall, an investment analyst with Barings in Kuala Lumpur,
estimates that the retail sector has accounted for as much as 70 per cent of
recent activity.
'Just look at the crowd in the broking offices. Mostly housewives or
shopowners,' says Mr Greenall. 'They are the people who have been giving a
real buzz to the market.
'Such is the dealing going on that some brokers are giving mobile phones to
their bigger clients. There's a great deal of purely speculative trading
happening but on the plus side there's still plenty of liquidity in the
market.'
Turnover figures back up that argument. A year ago average daily turnover
was about MDollars 200m. In recent weeks it has been around the MDollars 3bn
mark.
While there seems to be a consensus among analysts that, with market p/e
ratios up to around 30 most shares are looking expensive, opinions differ
about the likelihood of a sharp correction.
The head of a local securities house says that he is very uncomfortable with
the present situation. 'Until October the market was behaving reasonably
rationally and showing some signs of sophistication. But since then it's
gone back to the bad old days where speculation becomes confused with
fundamentals. It's defied the natural order of things.'
The fundamentals of the overall economy are looking good. Malaysia has one
of the world's fastest growing economies. Latest economic indicators suggest
that GDP will expand by about 8.5 per cent this year  - the sixth successive
year of more than 8 per cent growth.
The 1994 budget, delivered in late October, was seen to be generally good
for business, with a cut in the corporate tax rate and promises of big
increases in state spending, particularly on infrastructure.
In November, Malaysia's political future seemed to be settled with the
election of Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister, to the post of deputy
leader of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant
party.
Mr Anwar, 46, is now being seen as the heir apparent to Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
68, who has been the country's prime minister for the last 12 years.
Market optimists point to other positive factors. Malaysians, buoyed by
economic success, have been bringing back large amounts of money previously
parked overseas. With low interest rates people have been investing in the
stock market or buying property.
The government is committed to continuing its wide ranging privatisation
programme. Hicom, the government's heavy industry investment company, is due
to be floated early in 1994. Privatisation of the country's water system is
also on the cards.
Many companies have taken advantage of the buoyant market to restructure and
expand operations. Modern management techniques have taken the place of
old-style family-orientated business methods.
Companies like Sime Darby, Hong Leong and Genting are now considered to be
equal to the best in the region, and, sitting on considerable hoards of
cash, ready to take advantage of opportunities both at home and abroad.
But rapid market growth has caused problems. Many feel that much still needs
to be done to tighten up the regulatory aspects of the market.
The government has warned broking houses that they must strengthen their
back office operations. There has also been evidence of a more concerted
effort by the authorities to rid the market of insider trading and other
abuses.
A handful of companies, including Tenaga Nasional, the electricity utility,
and Telekom, the telecommunications company, account for about 50 per cent
of total market capitalisation.
Foreign activity has been concentrated mainly on these stocks and there are
fears that if institutions decide to sell their blue chips at the present
high prices, no one will be willing to buy. A quick slide in the market
could result.
Retail activity has been centred on the smaller stocks, some of which have
recorded spectacular gains. Companies rumoured to have strong links to
prominent politicians have been popular. Those which combine such
connections with expertise in fast growing sectors like infrastructure have
seen their stock market values treble or quadruple in recent months.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Dollar moves higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar rose against the D-Mark and yen on new indications of robust US
growth next year, Peter Marsh writes.
Traders in London were reported to be looking for further gains in the US
currency over the next few weeks, while few were willing to bet on any
relaxation in German interest rates when the Bundesbank council meets on
January 6.
While the Bonn government on Tuesday made bullish noises about a recovery
from the damaging German recession next year, the message from German
industrial groups yesterday was less encouraging.
The inference from this is that some on the Bundesbank's policymaking body
may consider appropriate a small easing in monetary conditions, especially
as news on the inflation front recently has been fairly positive.
Helping the dollar to gain in thin holiday trading were data indicating
continued strength in the US economy, particularly in the previously
hard-pressed housing market. Sales of existing US homes rose 2.9 per cent in
November from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
4.21m, the National Association of Realtors said. The US government's main
economic forecasting gauge showed a fourth straight gain in November as
industrial activity picked up. The index of leading indicators, which is
supposed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead, rose 0.5 per
cent after an identical increase in October.
Helped by this news, the dollar rose to a European close of DM1.718, a gain
of 1 1/2 pfennigs on Tuesday's finish. Against the yen, it rose to Y111.8
against Y111.35 previously and was close to brushing the 'wall' of Y112.
The Federal Association of German Industry said it expected only a slight
recovery in west Germany in 1994, with little chance of higher employment.
This gloomy tone was reinforced by the HDE German retailers' association,
which said German store groups would shed at least 30,000 jobs next year.
These reports may encourage hopes of a cut in German interest rates next
month.
In London the Bank of England provided the UK money market with Pounds 487m,
through its bill operations and Pounds 195m of 'late assistance' - lending
to discount houses at an unspecified rate. This compared with its forecast
of a Pounds 750m liquidity shortage. In Frankfurt, German call money rates
tightened as the Bundesbank unexpectedly drained a net DM5.1bn from the
banking system in its money market operations.
The pound slipped against the stronger dollar, closing in European trading
at Dollars 1.4915, compared with Dollars 1.5085 the previous day. Against
the D-Mark, sterling was little changed at DM2.5624.
With effect from today, the currency rates used in the FT's tables will use
data from a new source - the WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rates, after more than
a year of preparation by WM, Edinburgh-based portfolio valuation specialist.
The main change for readers is that the new data will be based on currency
values established at 4pm London time during the previous day's trading,
rather than the time of around 5pm used up to now.
Research by WM indicates that 4pm not only captures a larger selection of
quotes from continental contributors to the Reuters system, but also
reflects more accurately the peak trading period for the London and New York
foreign exchange markets.
The main purpose of the venture, supported by leading London market
practitioners, is to establish a daily standard for the foreign exchange
rates required for index calculation, investment management and portfolio
valuation. For the first time, a single suite of rates is available that
will allow accurate comparisons between competing indices and competing
funds. Outside the financial community, users of foreign exchange rates for
commercial contracts and transactions will benefit from access to a more
consistent set of data.
Because the market functions round the clock, establishing authoritative
'closing' rates for currencies has previously been difficult. As a result no
single, consistent set of foreign exchange rates has gained universal
acceptance. WM has developed a mechanism with Reuters to calculate and
publish a daily fixing, based on market rates derived from Reuters' foreign
exchange reporting system. The initial selection of 62 currencies includes
all those included in global or regional indices.
Besides using data from the WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rates for the foreign
exchange tables published in the newspaper, the Financial Times, with its
partners Goldman Sachs and NatWest Securities, has adopted the rates for use
in the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
Other leading users of foreign exchange data which will adopt the standard
include international index compilers such as J P Morgan, Morgan Stanley
Capital International and Salomon Brothers.
The system will work by selecting - at short intervals before and after 4pm
London time - representative bid, offer and mid rates for the 62 currencies
against the dollar. Anomalous data will be screened out, and a median rate
calculated for each currency. Spot rates for all 62 currencies against
sterling are then calculated as cross rates from the dollar parities,
reflecting foreign exchange market practice.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Co-ops take the high road to
marketing success - Scottish farmers are increasingly turning to
collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago a handful of trout farmers in south-west Scotland decided to
join forces to market their produce through a co-operative.
It proved a runaway success. Today Scot Trout processes 3,000 tonnes of
farmed trout a year, representing 80 per cent of the Scottish market and 20
per cent of the UK market. Its annual turnover is Pounds 12.5m.
Initially selling trout straight from the farm to the market, it has moved
into gutting and filleting and is investing Pounds 1.6m in better processing
facilities over the next three years. 'We're now looking at what we can put
back on the fish by stuffing it, enrobing it or turning it into goujons,'
says Mr David Hogg, chief executive.
Scot Trout is one of the most prominent of the farmer-owned co-operatives
that have become flagships of the Scottish food industry and the envy of
farmers' leaders south of the border, where collaborative ventures have a
more chequered history.
Faced with the possibility of reduced subsidies for European producers,
Scottish farmers are increasingly turning to collaboration to give them
muscle in a fiercely competitive marketplace.
Mr Maitland Mackie, a farmer near Aberdeen, produces about 10,000 pigs a
year. 'I market, as I believe everybody should do, through a producer group
which collects similar type pigs for the best market for that type of pig,'
he says.
As with farmed trout, about 80 per cent of Scottish pig production is sold
through co-operatives, a level comparable with some sectors in France or the
Netherlands, agricultural exporting countries for whom co-operatives are the
norm. Scottish co-operatives handle over 50 per cent of vegetable output,
nearly half of cereal production and 30 per cent of farm supplies, but less
than 10 per cent of cattle and sheep from hill farms.
The farming co-operative has a long tradition in Scotland. The oldest, Tarff
Valley, which still supplies the industry with feeds and fertilisers, was
set up in 1903.
'Farmers are better at co-operating in Scotland,' says Mr Alastair
Alexander, marketing director for the Scottish National Farmers' Union.
'Needs must. We're far from the markets and our land and climate are pretty
tough.'
The country's 100 or so co-operatives are grouped under the umbrella of the
Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society, which lobbies on their behalf
and offers advice on how to improve sales. Collective turnover amounts to
some Pounds 500m, equivalent to about a third of Scottish farm output.
Nearly half its funds are provided by the government, the rest by a levy on
members and consultancy fees.
In England, the National Farmers' Union is looking for a way of encouraging
domestic collaboration now the government has turned Food from Britain into
a purely export promotion body. 'SAOS is a very interesting example,' says
Mr David Evans, director general of the NFU. 'Whether something like that
would work in England is debatable.'
While there are success stories in England, interference by farmers in the
management of co-operatives has been partly blamed for the failure of some
collaborative ventures.
Mr Edward Rainy Brown, chief executive of SAOS, says his organisation tries
to overcome this by defining clearly the roles of board and management in
nascent co-operatives and emphasising the farmer-directors' responsibility
to the co-operative rather than to their individual farms.
Co-operatives can cover many aspects of farming. Machinery rings, where
farmers pool their equipment and labour and hire it to each other, are
becoming increasingly popular. The first started with 23 members in the
Borders about five years ago and 2,000 farmers now belong to 12 rings across
the country.
'The co-operatives provide a counter to the virtual dominance of the supply
sector by large national groups,' says Mr Rainy Brown.
Some co-operatives in different sectors are banding together to share
administrative costs. In south-west Scotland, Tarff Valley is working with a
machinery ring, a lamb marketing venture and a co-operative offering farm
secretarial services.
This trend should help co-operatives keep an eye on the wider scene, says Mr
David Douglas, agricultural manager for Clydesdale Bank. 'There's a real
danger that co-operatives could compete against co-operatives and that's
going to take away from the original aims,' he argues.
The most successful co-operatives have, however, been able to wring
advantages for their members from the powerful retail sector.
ANM Group, the largest agricultural co-operative with 8,000 members,
recently agreed that its Aberdeen Meat Marketing subsidiary would supply Wm
Low, the Scottish supermarket group, with 60 per cent of its red meat
requirements for the next 12 months. 'It's unique,' says Mr Brian Pack, ANM
Group's chief executive. 'It's usually done on a week-to-week basis.'
Mr Donald MacRae, agricultural specialist at TSB bank in Edinburgh, believes
ANM points the way to the future. 'SAOS should be encouraging the big
co-operatives to be bigger,' he says. 'We need a concentration on the
farming side to match the power of the processors and retailers. A strong
buyer demands a strong seller.'

FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba expects improved
efficiency to yield bigger sugar harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Cuban government is forecasting sugar production from the 1993-94
harvest at 'several hundred thousand tonnes' more than the 4.15m tonnes
produced in the last harvest, which was 40 per cent down on 1991-92.
President Fidel Castro and Mr Nelson Torres, the sugar minister, told a
session of the National Assembly in Havana that the expectations of a better
performance were based on increased use of fertiliser and improved
efficiency in the industry.
The forecast is more optimistic than that made in September when Mr Torres
indicated modest government expectations for the current harvest. He said
then that the harvest would end in April, earlier than normal, to allow the
planting of more cane for future harvests.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal hunters turn to S America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mining companies increasingly are switching their worldwide exploration
efforts towards Latin America. But the US still takes the biggest share of
exploration spending by the major companies, according to the Canadian
consultants, Metals Economics Group.
Budgets of the 137 companies reviewed total USDollars 1.7bn. Of this,
Dollars 345m is directed to the US. Australia gets Dollars 333m, Latin
America Dollars 331m, Canada Dollars 295m and the Pacific area Dollars 124m.
MEG points out that Canada has dropped from first place in terms of
exploration activity in 1989 to fourth this year.
Latin American countries receiving the most exploration attention this year
are Chile, with about 40 per cent of the total for the region; Mexico, about
20 per cent; and Brazil, about 19 per cent.
The percentage of expenditure directed to gold targets has been falling
steadily in recent years, according to MEG, while base metals-related
spending has been rising after a very low level of activity in the
mid-1980s. In this case the consultants reviewed the exploration spending
plans of 139 companies, totalling USDollars 1.9bn, and found Dollars 925m
(48.7 per cent of the total) being spent on gold this year compared with
Dollars 839m or 52 per cent in 1992 and Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent in 1991.
Base metals exploration expenditure this year is Dollars 669m or 35 per cent
of the total, compared with 32 per cent of the reported spend in 1992.
More than half the spending directed at other mining targets is for diamond
exploration. Some 29 big companies are involved in the search for diamonds,
but the Dollars 111.7m budgetted for diamond exploration and research by De
Beers of South Africa remains unchallenged.
RTZ Corporation of the UK, the world's biggest mining company, is also the
biggest spender on exploration, MEG suggests. Including the budget for CRA,
its 49 per cent-owned Australian associate, RTZ is spending Dollars 200m
this year compared with De Beers Dollars 111.7m. The third largest corporate
exploration budget, Dollars 71.8m, is attributed to BHP Minerals, part of
the Australian resources group.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pressure builds for oil cuts as
prices test fresh lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices tested new five-year lows yesterday as efforts intensified to
orchestrate a worldwide production cut by the main producing countries,
including those outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The price of the benchmark Brent blend for February fell 39 cents in early
trading in London yesterday to Dollars 13.25, its lowest level since
November 1988. The price began the year at about Dollars 20 a barrel.
The latest falls followed visits to the UK and Norway by Mr Said bin Ahmed
al-Shanfari, the Omani oil minister. Oman is not a member of Opec, but it
was among the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council that last week
called for production cuts to be shared among Opec and independent
producers.
Mr al-Shanfari is reported to be seeking agreement from the main oil
producing countries for a 1m-1.3m barrels a day cut to prop up prices.
On Tuesday he met Mr Tim Eggar, UK energy minister. World production levels
were discussed, but Mr Eggar reminded the Omani emissary that UK oil output
was decided by private sector companies.
In Oslo Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the Norwegian industry and energy minister,
said: 'Under the present circumstances we will not undertake any measures to
restrain our production. Opec is the cartel and Opec has the main
responsibility for exercising production restraints'.
Some small independent producers, such as Egypt, say they will abide by
output cuts. But analysts believe their participation in such a scheme would
probably be symbolic at best.
They say Opec needs to secure the co-operation of large independent
producers, including Russia, which Mr al-Shanfari is also expected to visit,
to make such a plan credible to international oil markets.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scots seek to avoid another
cereals overshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish farmers' leaders will meet next month to find a way of avoiding
another costly overshoot of the annual cereal production target they have to
meet under the reform of the common agricultural policy.
European Community farm ministers agreed earlier this month to water down
penalties for this year's overshoot, which the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland said would have cost the industry Pounds 20m.
'We're very relieved this threat has been lifted,' said Mr David Jack,
chairman of the union's cereals committee. 'It would have decimated Scottish
cereals production.'
The problem arose over a discrepancy between the 'base area' used by the
British government to calculate what Scotland's cereal output should be and
the actual arable area for which farmers claimed compensation from Brussels
for cuts in support prices.
The latter exceeded the former by 5.4 per cent, and the European Commission
was set to cut their payments this year by the equivalent - Pounds 4.5m -
and to require them to leave an extra 5.4 per cent of land idle next year
without compensation, in addition to the 15 per cent set-aside for which
they are paid.
The compromise put forward by the Commission, along the lines of offers made
to farmers facing penalties in Germany and Spain, would leave Scottish
arable farmers only about Pounds 2m short, according the union. Under the
compromise, they face a penalty of 0.54 per cent in payments and set-aside
for the first year, instead of 5.4 per cent.
The penalties will gradually increase if the base area is exceeded in coming
years.
Mr Jack said the union still had doubts about the Scottish Office's base
area, which was calculated using census figures. However, he said the
meeting of the cereals committee on January 19 would review the whole
scheme.

Italy has scrapped stamp duty on government bond trading on regulated
markets in an effort to retain business and prevent trading from shifting
abroad, the cabinet said, Reuter reports from Rome.
Italian government bonds remain subject to the 12.5 per cent withholding tax
on coupon payments. Italy has a large secondary government bond market which
trades about L13,000bn worth of paper a day.
However, increasing demand for Italian paper from foreign investors has
caused a boom in centres such as London.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Government and International Bonds: Bundesbank sells further
DM4.2bn of 30-year issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Bundesbank provided the main focus of attention in the European
government bond markets yesterday with the sale of the new 30-year German
government bond issue.
The central bank sold a further DM4.20bn of the 6.25 per cent, 30-year bond
yesterday at a weighted average price of 99.71, giving an average yield of
6.27 per cent.
The size of the issue will be DM10bn, consisting of yesterday's tender
tranche combined with DM3bn allocated to the Bundesbank's bond-issuing
consortium and the DM2.79bn to be used for market operations.
The bund market rallied yesterday, but the 30-year area underperformed with
the 30-year yield spread over the 10-year bund widening from 66 to 69 basis
points.
The German central bank intends to make use of the 30-year maturity on a
regular basis, expanding the range of government securities on offer to
investors eager to have the option of investing at a range of maturities
along the yield curve.
The increased flexibility is likely to reduce the government's borrowing
costs and enhance the attractions of Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a
financial centre.
Traders expect demand for the new issue to come chiefly from foreign
investors who are more optimistic about further cuts in German interest
rates than domestic institutions.
US Treasury prices eased slightly at both ends of the market yesterday as
more news of a strengthening economy continued to put bonds under selling
pressure.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  3/16 at
100, yielding 6.245 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/32 at 100 3/32 , to carry a yield of 4.184 per cent.
The latest economic data to unsettle the market was a 0.5 per cent increase
in the November leading indicators, and a 2.9 per cent increase in November
existing home sales. Although the numbers did not come in that far over
analysts' expectations, they were the latest in a line of statistics
suggesting the economy is growing at a healthy rate.
Analysts said the market would probably stay in a tight trading range into
the new year, with investors waiting to see if the economy sustains its pace
in early 1994.
UK government bonds opened on a firm note after the Christmas break, with
dealers noting some buying interest as hopes of a cut in the base rate
continued to sustain the gilt market. The Liffe long gilt futures contract
touched a high of 120.20, but drifted lower later in the day to trade at
around 120.10 by late afternoon.
The Spanish government bond market shrugged off the financial crisis facing
Banesto, Spain's fourth largest bank, in spite of some concern over the
impact on the Spanish banking system.
Prices ended virtually unchanged, and the news is not expected to have an
impact on today's Treasury auction of three, five and 10-year debt.
Eurobond activity has virtually ground to a halt, and is expected to remain
extremely thin until the new year. Only a handful of new issues emerged
yesterday.
In the French market, Societe Generale launched two FFr800m offerings.
One deal was a further tranche of a FFr2.2bn issue of 5 1/4 per cent bonds
due January 1996. The other, using a more complicated structure, pays a
fixed coupon of 7 per cent for the first six months, and then a floating
rate of interest for the rest of its 10-year life.

FT  30 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Banks revive appetite for
assets - Aggressive loan pricing set new standards in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the international syndicated loans market, 1993 will go down as the year
when the pricing on loans at last headed lower, reversing the trend of the
previous three years.
Syndicated deals from Reuters, the international news and information group,
and Northern Foods, the UK dairy and food manufacturing company, attracted
considerable attention in the market because of their aggressive pricing,
and were seen by many as setting new standards for loan pricing.
The 1980s were a time of cheap and easy access to bank loans: banks fell
over one another to lend money, and borrowers were able to command
favourable and tight pricing on the loans.
However, the climate changed in late 1989 and early 1990. The pricing on
loans started to edge up as the international capital adequacy requirements
agreed by the Basle Committee forced international banks to adopt a more
selective approach to lending.
Capital adequacy requirements were not the only worry for the banks. The
combination of recession and a spate of corporate disasters including Polly
Peck and the Maxwell empire prompted bankers to think more carefully about
the creditworthiness of their customers, and should have made them more
discriminating in their lending policy.
Now there are signs the recession is ending, and bankers are, once again,
hungry for assets. As the supply of funds exceeds demand, many borrowers are
finding that they can obtain more aggressive terms on their loans.
The question uppermost in some bankers' minds is whether pricing will fall
further in 1994.
As one banker points out, the banks will have plenty of money to lend given
the expectation that about 40 per cent of the loan book of banks in London
is due to reach maturity in the next 18 months.
The initial signs that pricing had reached a peak and was starting to turn
down came in mid-1992, but bankers said the real acid test was the Reuters
deal in early 1993, followed by Northern Foods' loan - both borrowers
regarded as top-class corporate names.
Reuters initially set out to borrow Pounds 100m, but the deal was heavily
oversubscribed and it raised Pounds 160m through a five-year loan, paying a
margin of 37.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
Participation fees were 8 basis points for Pounds 15m and 6 basis points for
Pounds 10m.
'Bankers sucked their teeth at the time because the margin was under 40
basis points, but the fact is the deal was done and it has set the standard
for UK corporates,' said one syndicated loan specialist at a European bank.
Northern Foods signed a Pounds 150m five-year revolving credit in May, also
paying a margin of 37.5 basis points over Libor.
Bankers point out that UK corporates had been borrowing at margins of around
50 basis points over Libor in 1992, edging down to 45 basis points in
mid-1992 for good names. With Reuters and Northern Foods both borrowing at
margins of 37.5 basis points, the question bankers now ask is how much
further can the margin fall? 'It's going to go down lower, the question is
how low - can it get to 35 basis points?' says one UK banker.
The OECD figures paint a less cheerful picture of pricing for syndicated
credits in the OECD area. In 1990, the average spread was 51 basis points,
rising to 86 basis points in 1992 and 92 basis points for the first four
months of 1993.
While conditions may have become more favourable for some borrowers in 1993,
there is not much sign of a stampede to the international syndicated loans
market.
The volume of international loans held pretty steady in 1993 with total
signed loans amounting to Dollars 181.85bn, against Dollars 181.60bn in
1992, according to Euromoney Loanware.
While the first three-quarters of 1993 were as strong or stronger than the
previous year, the final quarter saw a sharp drop in activity.
Bankers attribute this to the fact that some UK borrowers want to borrow
money but would prefer to hold off until pricing comes down a few more basis
points.
'My impression is that the loan market has been fairly vibrant. Some UK
corporates are saying they will hold off until the New Year as there's
definitely a few basis points to come off the pricing,' says Mr Stan Hurn,
head of banking syndicate at the Midland Bank group in London.
'The negative factors which have been affecting the syndicated loan market
since mid-1990 continued to exert a strong influence during the first four
months of 1993,' according to the June 1993 OECD report Financial Market
Trends.
'New capital demand continued to be limited by the protracted weakness of
the world economy, a very low-level of internationally-financed merger and
acquisition operations, and the availability of cost-effective and flexible
financing for borrowers on the securities markets, including the rapidly
expanding markets for medium-term notes or some domestic markets for private
placements,' it adds.
Many bankers see little prospect of activity picking up dramatically in 1994
given the attractions of alternative sources of funding such as the
international bond markets and equity markets.
As western economies emerge from the difficult recessionary climate,
borrowers may be more cautious about becoming heavily indebted again.
'In the UK, I can't see much new demand for next year - all the multi-option
facilities' refinancings have been done, and UK corporates are not in a rush
because they are coming out of recession slowly and gradually and are not
going to be rushing out to build new factories or acquire other companies,'
says one banker.

FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: Timken to take Dollars 48m
charge as jobs go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Timken, the US manufacturer of bearings and alloy steels, is to take a
special Dollars 48m charge against pre-tax earnings to cover an accelerated
productivity improvement programme that could cost 2,200 jobs over the next
few years.
The Ohio-based company said the charge would reduce fourth-quarter net
income by Dollars 1.13 a share.
Excluding the charge, Timken expects positive operating income for the
fourth quarter and the year - for the first nine months of 1993, it had
operating income of Dollars 12.3m on sales of Dollars 1.3bn. A Dollars 254m
accounting adjustment produced a net loss of Dollars 242m or Dollars 7.90 a
share for the first nine months.
Mr Joseph Toot, president and chief executive, said the company needed to
quicken the pace of its achievements in international competitiveness and
increase its ability to gain more business.
At current operating levels the accelerated programme would reduce Timken's
worldwide workforce of 16,000 by 2,200. The charge reflects costs of about
900 lay-offs worldwide, with the rest achieved through retirements,
attrition and cutting part-time employment.
Already this year, Timken has announced the closure by mid-1994 of its
bearing plant at Daventry in the UK. Its operations are being consolidated
into the nearby factory at Duston.
This week's announcement comes six months after Timken said it was resuming
work on its new Dollars 120m plant in Asheboro, North Carolina. But a
planned sister plant at Ueberherrn, Germany, which had also been postponed
in 1992, remains shelved.

FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: Samsung engages in a higher
quality revolution - The results of the strict regime introduced at the
South Korean conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is being called Chairman Lee Kun-hee's cultural revolution at Samsung,
South Korea's oldest and largest conglomerate.
Instead of little red books, there are Chairman Lee's videotapes, which
engage in masochistic corporate self-criticism. The message is that Samsung
is in danger of becoming a second-rate international business unless the
group rapidly shifts its focus from quantity to quality and overhauls its
cumbersome bureaucracy.
Samsung and other South Korean conglomerates, or chaebol, have become
fixated on market share and sales volume at the expense of high-quality
goods that can compete in advanced industrial markets, according to Mr Lee.
Not only is Samsung in danger of losing global sales as rising labour costs
rob it of price competitiveness, but it also faces the threat of better
products in its home market as Korea dismantles its trade barriers,
particularly against Japanese goods.
The harsh message was prompted by the chairman's visit to the US last year.
Retailers told him that Samsung consumer electronics, one of the group's
main areas, suffered a poor image because of high defect rates.
To underscore the sense of urgency, the 51-year-old son of the group's late
founder has introduced radical western management practices this year at
Samsung, which previously was considered the Korean chaebol most influenced
by Japanese corporate culture.
'We are trying to create the psychological atmosphere for change, and break
down the hierarchical mind-set to improve efficiency,' said Mr Hwang
Young-key, the executive director for personnel. 'We are willing to
sacrifice sales and profits for quality improvement.'
Foreign analysts believe weaning Korean groups away from their
empire-building will not be easy. But Ms Nicola Gwynne-Howell of Baring
Securities in London is confident that Samsung is proceeding in the right
direction. 'They're global leaders in a lot of the technologies they are in,
such as semi-conductors,' she says. Although Samsung's corporate programme
still has some way to go, 'the ingredients are right'.
As part of its new and more focused approach, Samsung's 180,000 employees
work a shorter and earlier schedule - from 7am to 4pm - to encourage them to
be more productive. 'We are telling them with this measure that the group is
changing, so you should change too in your work habits,' explains Mr Hwang.
Senior executives must spend four days out of their six-day week at
factories, meeting suppliers and customers instead of remaining behind their
desks. Tape recorders have replaced written records at meetings to reduce
paperwork. Workers are encouraged to stop the assembly line whenever they
spot a production defect and fix the problem.
It is too early to say whether these management practices are cosmetic or
will have a significant effect on Samsung's performance, although most
analysts believe that Mr Lee has identified a serious fault that underlies
the corporate strategy of all chaebol.
Perhaps more crucial for the future of Samsung, which estimates 1993 sales
at Won50,000bn (Dollars 61bn), is a restructuring of its 48 companies, which
range from electronics to construction to petrochemicals.
There is a growing awareness at Samsung and the other chaebol that rampant
diversification is hindering their global competitiveness. The groups need
to concentrate on a few core industries to achieve success abroad.
'We have been covering so many industries, from light and heavy
manufacturing to the service sector, that we didn't know where to place the
emphasis,' said Mr Lim Dong-sung, president of the Samsung Economic Research
Institute.
A first step to slimming down the group was taken in June when Samsung
announced that it was selling or merging most of its peripheral light
industry and service companies, reducing the number of subsidiaries to 34.
They include two of Samsung's original businesses, food and textiles, with
other members of the Lee family members acquiring some of them.
The future focus of Samsung will be on high-tech and heavy industrial
companies, supported by an expanding financial services business, including
Korea's leading insurance company.
The goal is to develop other world-class companies to match the success of
Samsung Electronics, which accounts for 16 per cent of group sales and is
the world's leading manufacturer of memory chips.
This may prove difficult since some of Samsung's other main businesses have
encountered recent problems. Samsung Engineering &amp; Construction was punished
by the government earlier this year after it was blamed for building faults
that caused one of the nation's worst railway accidents. Samsung General
Chemicals, its petrochemical business, is losing money due to production
overcapacity in this sector.
One possible growth candidate is Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), which is
expected to be listed shortly. The company is one of Korea's leading
manufacturers of ships, construction equipment and machinery.
But SHI's ambitions are controversial, since it wants to expand into car
production, which would cost at least Dollars 2bn in initial investments.
Some analysts warn the move is risky because Korea could face a production
glut in the next few years as the country's five existing car manufacturers
expand capacity.
Those doubts are shared by some Samsung officials. 'When we can't even make
a television properly, how can we make a good car?' asked one executive.
The government also has its reservations. It recently blocked what was
suspected to be a takeover bid by Samsung for Kia Motors, the country's
second biggest motor company.
Samsung has also shown interest in the aerospace sector. Samsung Aerospace
Industries is the country's largest aircraft manufacturer with its licensed
production of the F-16 fighter jet for the Korean Air Force.
It is now planning to move into the civilian aviation business. It recently
agreed with Aviation Industries of China to develop a mid-size commuter
aircraft and may start a domestic carrier to create a market for the
airliners.
Samsung's move to higher value-added industries, such as cars and aerospace,
is understandable. But the strategy carries with it the risk that it may
only encourage further expansion when the group needs to focus its energies
on a few selected businesses. Whether Samsung can achieve balanced growth
may prove to be the true test of Chairman Lee's management reforms.

Mercedes-Benz, the automobile subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, is to
increase commercial vehicle production outside Germany.
The expansion will concentrate on the south American market as well as China
and Indonesia, according to Mr Bernd Gottschalk, the Mercedes-Benz board
director responsible for truck production, in an interview with a German
newspaper.
The plan is consistent with Mercedes' decision to shift production of
passenger vehicles out of the high-cost German manufacturing environment
but, according to Mr Gottschalk, the purpose of the expansion is to take
advantage of new market opportunities and benefit from lower costs.
The share of foreign production of commercial vehicles has risen over recent
decades to around 50 per cent in 1993, in stark contrast with Mercedes
passenger cars, all built in Germany. This is set to change following
Mercedes' decision earlier this year to build a car factory in Alabama, but
this month Daimler stepped back from further foreign production when it
decided to locate production of a planned small car in Germany rather than
abroad.
Mr Gottschalk said that Mercedes planned to start selling light commercial
vehicles, in south America. The group planned to invest about Dollars 100m
in new production capacity in Argentina.
The new factory will be used to assemble 15,000 to 20,000 new T1N trucks
each year to be sold throughout South American, operating in tandem with the
group's main production site for light commercial vehicles at Dusseldorf in
Germany. The T1N will come to the market in early 1995.
The executive said the group intended to strengthen its presence in China,
where it already plans two joint ventures to manufacture buses and is in
talks with a local manufacturer over a joint venture to build engines. This
could lead to production of medium-weight commercial vehicles in China, he
added.
Mr Gottschalk, who mentioned plans for increased production in Indonesia as
well, insisted that the expansion abroad would not be at the expense of
manufacturing in Germany. He said the future of domestic plants was not
black, so long as restructuring plans were implemented effectively.
He said that commercial vehicle turnover would drop this year by about 5 per
cent from DM26.9bn in 1992, while unit sales would fall 7 per cent to
255,000.

Brau und Brunnen, the German brewery, is paying DM4.112m (Dollars 2.42m) for
a 67 per cent stake in Kamenitza, one of Bulgaria's leading breweries, in
the first substantial foreign investment in Bulgaria's brewing sector.
Up to 20 per cent of the shares have been offered to employees in compliance
with Bulgaria's privatisation laws.
Under the contract, the Dortmund-based holding company has to make an
additional investment of at least DM3.8m within two years.
The company will continue to manufacture and market the Kamenitza brand for
the next three years at least, and will start producing Schultheiss beer
under licence for the domestic market and export.
The brewery's current annual production of 33m litres will be doubled in two
years.
Mr Michael Brenscheidt, Brau und Brunnen's executive director, said the
acquisition was another step in the group's long-term strategy.

FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: Occidental wins price violation
ruling
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Occidental Petroleum has won a Dollars 1bn ruling from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) over charges of price control violations dating
back to the late 1970s.
In a decision issued this week the FERC, an independent commission within
the US Department of Energy, reversed an earlier judicial decision that
would have required Oxy USA, Occidental's subsidiary, to pay Dollars 261.4m
plus interest for alleged violations of government pricing rules between
1979 and 1981.
A separate proceeding brought by the Department of Energy last year alleging
that the same crude oil transactions violated other regulations is still
pending. That case would also involve close to Dollars 1bn in principal and
interest.
Occidental agreed in 1989 to pay the government Dollars 205m to settle its
claims, which already totalled more than Dollars 700m in penalties and
accumulated interest, but the Department of Energy later decided to move to
litigation.
The case involves deals which the Energy Department calls reciprocal crude
oil transactions and Occidental terms tier trades, in which Cities Service
Oil and Gas, now Oxy USA, provided crude oil subject to government price
controls to a reseller, in exchange for crude that was exempt from the
controls.
Occidental's is believed to be the largest case left from the era of oil
price controls, imposed in response to the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and in
place until 1981. A temporary emergency court of appeals set up to decide
price control suits was not dissolved until earlier this year.

FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: There was some corner of a foreign field .
. . - Why the Plantations sector of the FT share service is coming to an end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Nearly everyone who owned shares in the UK used to hold shares in some
funny rubber company,' says Mr Edwin Hadsley-Chaplin, chairman of Rowe Evans
Investments.
His company is now one of the few still listed under the Plantations sector
of the FT London share service. From next Tuesday plantations will be found
in a subsector under Other Services and Businesses, marking the end of an
era for what used to be one of the most important parts of the London
market, with its own FT correspondent.
The market capitalisation of all the plantations now is simply too small to
make a separate index sector possible.
It was a very different story early in the century, when the plantation
sector experienced explosive growth as demand from the motor industry took
off. By 1942 the Official Guide for Investors in Rubber Shares, issued by
Mincing Lane Tea and Rubber Share Brokers' Association, listed hundreds of
individual plantation companies.
Among them was Bertam, still listed but now 35 per cent owned by Rowe Evans,
and Sumatra Para Rubber Plantations, wholly owned by Rowe Evans. Both were
registered in 1907.
In the same year the Rubber Growers' Association was formed in London, and
became the main source of all technical expertise and commercial practice in
the world rubber industry.
However, by the 1950s the number of companies was starting to dwindle. Only
the London assets were reflected in the share price, not the value of the
estates themselves, so that the companies were sitting ducks for a takeover.
In 1957 Malaysian independence started to accelerate the process. New
economic policies emerged in the 1970s, as Malaysia sought greater control
over its resources.
The big companies started to protect themselves. For example Sime Darby, the
Malaysian conglomerate, put all its holdings into Consolidated Plantations,
with a listing in Malaysia and a secondary listing in London.
However, plans are afoot to take it back into the main group, which would
take another company off the London list.
Other companies amalgamated to keep the predators at bay, among them the
plantations that went to form Highlands &amp; Lowlands under Mr Thomas Barlow.
Highlands is also still listed in Malaysia with a secondary London listing,
as is Kuala Lumpur Kepong.
Mr Hadsley-Chaplin sums up the process as threefold - cheap acquisitions,
amalgamation and Malaysianisation. He attributes his own company's survival
to 'various quirks,' among which he lists its relatively small size.
The company was founded in 1870 by Mathew Pennyfather Evans who had tea
interests in Ceylon. By the time Mr Hadsley-Chaplin joined in 1947 it was a
secretarial and agency company, operating like a partnership. Gradually a
portfolio of shares was built in the companies it was acting for, so that
the company became bigger as an investment and estate holding company. It
was turned into a listed company about 10 years ago.
Rowe Evans is now operating plantations in Indonesia and investing in
Malaysia and Australia.
Bertam not only operates plantations, but has branched into property
development in Malaysia and investment in Indonesia.
The only completely new plantation company to come to the market in recent
times has been Anglo-Eastern, which was floated in 1985 in order to raise
money to finance its 6,000-hectare Tasik plantation in Indonesia. However,
Chillington, the conglomerate with interests in plantations, has sold most
of its 49.2 per cent stake to Genton of Hong Kong, further illustrating the
drift away from London.
Anglo's history reflects the age-old problem with plantation investment  -
the long lead time before crops start to produce cash. The initial
investment is also high. Tasik alone has 250 miles of roads.
Nevertheless, Mr Rollo Barnes, Anglo's executive director, says his company
is thinking of developing another plantation. But it will think carefully
about how to do it without pulling the current operation down.
'The average institutional investor does not want to know as there is no
return for nine years,' he says. But he believes the pension funds should be
interested. 'They should take a longer term view.'
Tasik mainly produces palm oil, which is very price volatile, ranging
between Dollars 1,000 a tonne in 1984 and Dollars 200 in 1986. However, an
investment is as well underwritten as it ever was by the value of the land.
The estate cost Dollars 20m, complete with crushing mill, equivalent to
Dollars 3,000 a hectare, but Mr Barnes believes it could be sold for between
Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 6,000 a hectare.
Other UK companies with strong interests in palm oil and other commodities
include Harrisons &amp; Crosfield and REA Holdings, whose initials denote its
origins in a rubber estate agency early this century. It is now listed under
Business Services.
Last year REA started a 12-year project to create a palm oil plantation of
50,000 hectares (or 150 sq miles) but is aiming to raise the Pounds 10m that
will be needed in three or four years time in Jakarta.
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, first registered in 1908 as a rubber company and now
listed under Conglomerates, sold its 30 per cent stake in Golden Hope,
another Malaysian company with a secondary London listing, in 1989, but has
retained extensive interests in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
Williamson Tea Holdings is an unusual survivor and remains very much the old
type of family plantation company. Although it has only been listed since
1964 it dates back to 1868, when it was founded by the great grandfather of
Mr Philip Magor, the managing director.
From next week the company will be found under Food Manufacturers, where
Unilever, owner of Brooke Bond and many plantations, and James Finlay,
another large tea grower are already listed.
However, Williamson claims to be the biggest private sector company in the
world devoted to tea production, with 34,000 hectares under plantation - far
more than Unilever.
Mr Magor points out that after the war the end of colonialism and the rise
of nationalism naturally led to a decline in UK investment in the sector.
Williamson decided to stick to its business, however, and has made sure it
has good and prosperous partners, particularly in India, to ensure its
interests are well looked after.
The group, 62 per cent held by George Williamson Holdings, has always been
prudently managed, Mr Magor says. 'We have never been great borrowers, and
we have maintained development from retained profits.'
He agrees with Mr Barnes that plantations are long-term propositions for
investors. 'Sometimes we do very well - but it's occasional. We might have
one really good year in 10.'
The UK's continued high consumption of tea has has ensured a strong British
interest remains in the industry. Mr Magor estimates that Williamson,
Unilever, James Finlay and Camellia (listed under Other Financial) account
for 8 to 10 per cent of the world's tea production.
Williamson this month completed moving two thirds of its staff to Newbury,
Berkshire, again reflecting the retreat from the City, although the group is
maintaining a London office.
The London tea auction four years ago lost its own room at Sir John Lyon
House in High Timber Street, where Williamson had its head office. The
auction is now held at the London Chamber of Commerce.
Meanwhile, the Tropical Growers Association, formerly the Rubber Growers
Association, can no longer afford to remain in its Dickensian offices above
a Chinese restaurant in Artillery Row, near Liverpool Street station.
It still has 200 members in 20 countries controlling or managing 800,000
hectares and producing 2.26m tonnes of commodities annually - rubber, palm
oil, coconut, cocoa, banana, coffee, tea and pepper. But the subscription
income has fallen from Pounds 67,806 in 1990 to Pounds 54,600 last year, and
it will probably move out of the City to cheaper premises in Barking, Essex,
next year.
While its removal could well mark the end of an era, there is no doubt that
the UK still has a useful interest in plantations. Mr Hadsley-Chaplin, a
former chairman of the association, says: 'It is an extremely sophisticated
industry now. I don't think that is appreciated by UK institutional
investors.
'But the basic seat is no longer London, which has lost out and lost
interest.'

FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Tate pays Pounds 1.1m to former chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, disclosed yesterday that it
paid Pounds 1.1m in compensation to Mr Stephen Brown, its former chief
executive, who left the company in March.
The compensation package - based on Mr Brown's three-year rolling contract
on a basic salary of about Pounds 300,000 a year - was agreed after he
failed to resolve differences over management style with Mr Neil Shaw,
chairman.
As part of the payment, Mr Brown received Pounds 567,000 from Tate &amp; Lyle
and a further Pounds 515,000 from the group's subsidiaries.
The former chief executive is also understood to have received Pounds
285,000 from the disposal in July of a house in Kensington, west London.
Tate &amp; Lyle had a 70 per cent stake in the property, while Mr Brown held the
remainder.
According to the company's annual report, the house was sold for Pounds
950,000 just over a year after they purchased it jointly for Pounds 900,000.
The property disposal and compensation payment marked the end of what
analysts described as an embarrassing period for Tate &amp; Lyle.
Mr Shaw, who split the roles of chairman and chief executive in April 1992
to make way for Mr Brown, said it was clear after less than 12 months that
their relationship 'wasn't working'.
Since the chief executive's departure, the group has been overseen by an
executive committee comprising four divisional directors, the finance
director and chair-man.
The share price closed up 2p at 397p.

FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Chas Letts turns over new leaf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New diaries, as traditional at new year as broken resolutions, are turning
over a new leaf at Charles Letts which will fund the development with Pounds
16m in equity finance from venture capital backers.
The private company, which claims 25 per cent of the UK's Pounds 70m diary
market and estimates a 5 per cent share of diary sales in the western world,
is examining whether users could do without standard features like
conversion formulae and weights and measures.
A market research exercise will look at replacing these stalwarts with new
items such as travel planning and time management - in full colour.
Helped by company doctor Mr Bill Gore, chief executive since June, Charles
Letts has extricated itself from an unsuccessful 1980s diversification into
lifestyle publishing, brassware and property.
Now claiming to be the world's only dedicated diary maker, Letts has secured
the finance through a deal led by 3i with support from Morgan Grenfell
Development Capital and Hambros Bank.
The new money will reduce debt of Pounds 17m to an annual peak of about
Pounds 7m. In the year to January 31 1994 the company expects to return to
the black with pre-tax profits of about Pounds 500,000 on sales of Pounds
27m, compared with losses of some Pounds 7m on sales of Pounds 29m.
Mr Gore declined to comment on prospects for a flotation, but said: 'The
deal brings in venture capital and it will seek an exit at some point.'

FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Shield makes acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shield Group, the holding company that owns Stickley Kent, the auctioneer
and property insolvency specialist, has acquired Kamco Computer Systems, a
leading maker of customised personal computers.
Mr Norman Mazure, the chairman who owns 30 per cent of Shield, said
yesterday that the company paid less than Pounds 50,000 cash for Kamco,
which is expected to report turnover this year of Pounds 4m.
Kamco, founded five years ago and based in Uxbridge, sells its products only
through mail order and advertising. Mr Mazure said the mail order market for
PCs was worth about Pounds 1.2bn a year in the UK and was shared between 600
companies. He believed Kamco to be about sixth or seventh biggest.
Shield intends to keep Kamco's existing management team, including Mr Zygi
Kamasa, the founder and managing director, and Mr Gary Russell, operations
director.

FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Planting the seeds for future growth -
Hewden-Stuart, an avid exponent of 'bottom fishing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The art of 'bottom fishing' - snapping up competitors or their assets when
prices are at a minimum - is more spoken about than practised.
One avid exponent, however, is Hewden-Stuart, the UK's biggest independent
plant hire company.
The Glasgow-based group paid Pounds 11m in July for the Hireplant assets of
BET, acquiring 24,000 items of plant and 29 freehold properties. By October,
analysts were pleasantly surprised to learn that the previously lossmaking
business was expected to make an immediate contribution to group profits.
Hewden-Stuart bought Hireplant, which usefully extends the group's existing
network of depots, at a Pounds 3m discount to its already written-down net
assets, and did so in time to take advantage of capital allowances. The
shrewdness of the deal gives a clue as to how Hewden-Stuart has managed to
come through the recession without recording a loss, although profits have
slumped by two thirds from the Pounds 36m made in 1989.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, Hewden-Stuart's veteran chairman, says the group drew
on its experience of previous recessions to navigate the recent downturn,
but cautions that the national recovery is erratic and the 'crazy' days of
the late eighties are unlikely ever to return.
The group was certainly not unscathed by the crash. Hewden-Stuart had 70 per
cent of all the tower cranes in London at the peak of the boom, and was the
main supplier to Canary Wharf. It had hoped to transfer many of them to east
Germany, but was caught out by the European recession.
However, for Sir Matthew recent experience has just confirmed what has long
been his fundamental tenet: 'The only thing that matters in any business is
cashflow. This must be understood throughout the group.'
Using a conservative depreciation policy, Hewden-Stuart has maintained
strong cashflow, even although pre-tax profits flagged, and can usually sell
old equipment at a premium to its written-down value. The chairman says:
'When looking at a depot, there was never any question of closure so long as
it was generating cash.'
A qualified chartered accountant, Sir Matthew, 64, has been chairman of the
group since 1979 and an executive director since 1960. He says this cautious
approach to finance is long-standing: 'We would not buy anything unless we
could finance 25 per cent of its purchase price in cash. That rule still
applies.'
Hewden-Stuart also steers clear of leasing and hire-purchase. Sir Matthew
says: 'Wherever possible we have bought our properties so that if we want to
move out, we can sell up and move on.'
October marked the 25th anniversary of Hewden-Stuart's flotation. Sir
Matthew pointed out that any investors who joined in 1968 would by then have
seen a thirty-fold increase in the capital value of their holding, an
overall return few companies could emulate.
The group's pre-tax profits increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 9.1m in first
half of the year, even though turnover rose only slightly. The chairman said
the downward trend in profits experienced for the last three years was
reversed in the early summer, but this was more a reflection of good
husbandry than any real strengthening in the workload of customers.
Hewden-Stuart has net cash balances, in spite of having spent Pounds 11m on
Hireplant and a further Pounds 17m on new equipment in the first half, and
investment in plant is continuing at a high rate.
The improvement in the hire division's profits reflected benefits from the
heavy capital expenditure programme which had been carried through the
recession, often at a cost which adversely affected profits at the time.
Sir Matthew said machines taken in part-exchange by the group's
merchandising business now tended to be older than usual, with a shortage of
modern second-hand equipment. 'This supports the view that the condition and
age of plant fleets generally has deteriorated and brings nearer the time
when customers will seek quality and service, albeit at higher prices.'
The group expects that construction companies will hesitate to buy plant in
the face of an uncertain upturn, which should benefit hire businesses. The
growing gap between the value of old plant and the cost of replacing it
should also encourage hiring rather than purchase. Sir Matthew says this
will be encouraged by the reduction in the number of finance companies
prepared to fund the acquisition of equipment: 'Many banks and leasing
companies have said to me 'never again'.'
Although even the group's much reduced tower cranes operation is expected to
be back in the black by the end of the year, Sir Matthew sounds a cautious
note about the speed of any upturn - emphasising that he has yet to see much
sign of recovery in hire rates: 'In the longer term the surplus of plant
which still exists in this country will be eliminated and the demand for
hire will increase, a process that hopefully will become apparent in 1994.'
In spite of being deputy chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, Sir
Matthew stands apart from some of the attitudes which have dominated the
financial and commercial world in recent years. He has little time for
blandishments of merchant bankers who continually offer their services to
the group, and also eschews the more aggressive forms of City public
relations.
He sees his group as a partnership between shareholders, management and
employees - making no apology for what some described as a 'parsimonious'
recent dividend increase. He says: 'In a recessionary period where salaries,
wages and costs require to be carefully controlled, it would be
inappropriate to do other than moderately increase the dividend.'
Meanwhile, the employees at Hireplant have been getting to know their new
boss. Sir Matthew said: 'I spent three days going round the depots. I find
it very useful to sit down and have a mug of tea with drivers, fitters and
managers and discuss problems. They hadn't seen anyone from head office for
years.'
The former BET staff also discovered a habit of Sir Matthew's long familiar
to Hewden-Stuart's depot managers: 'I always go round the back the check
what's in the junkyard.'

FT  30 DEC 93 / Eisner admits Euro Disney pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, has
written to shareholders describing Euro Disney, the troubled French theme
park that is 49 per cent owned by Disney, as his company's 'first real
financial disappointment'.
'This had been a very serious problem: one that has cost us an enormous
amount of time and anxiety,' wrote Mr Eisner. He added that Euro Disney's
performance had been dire. 'Some would call it dreadful, and in a financial
sense, I'd be forced to agree.' Mr Eisner's comments came at the end of a
year in which Euro Disney's difficulties have depressed Walt Disney's share
price and finances.
Walt Disney shares fell Dollars  1/4 by yesterday in New York to Dollars 43
7/8 . Euro Disney's shares rallied in Paris to close up FFr2.85 at FFr31.90,
having fallen sharply the previous day.
Euro Disney, which is struggling to avert bankruptcy by negotiating an
emergency financial restructuring package with its creditor banks, has since
the opening of the EuroDisneyland theme park in April 1992 been burdened by
heavy debt and badly affected by the European economic recession.
The company, which recently reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 607m)
for the year to September 30, has severe cashflow problems and is expected
to run out of cash early next year, thereby becoming technically bankrupt.
Walt Disney has promised to support it financially until the completion of
the restructuring, but only until March 31.
Mr Eisner stressed that he would not allow Euro Disney's problems to imperil
his company. He told shareholders: 'We certainly are interested in aiding
Euro Disney, the public company that bears our name and reputation. We will
deal in good faith with our fellow shareholders and Euro Disney creditors.
But in doing so I promise all shareholders of Walt Disney that we will take
no action to endanger the health of Disney itself.'
The Disney camp is awaiting an audit commissioned by the creditor banks into
Euro Disney's financial position before full-scale negotiations over
restructuring can get under way.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Hanson makes Pounds 90m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's disposal programme continued yesterday with the Pounds 90m sale of
11 companies to a management buy-out team backed by the venture capitalist
group, Electra.
The deal brings the total raised through disposals this year to Pounds 250m.
Hanson is understood to have targeted a range of non-core businesses for
sale to raise more than Pounds 500m to reduce its Pounds 3.4bn debt.
The 11 disparate businesses, with total net assets of Pounds 40m, include
SLD Pumps, the UK's largest pump hire business with 40 per cent of the
market. This is thought to have been the main target for Electra and the MBO
team, along with two other plant hire operations. It is expected that these
will be floated in roughly three years' time.
SLD Holdings, the buy-out vehicle, is also acquiring a range of
manufacturing and other companies which are likely be sold in the
longer-term.
The shares defied the buoyant market, rising just 1p to 273 1/2 p. This may
have reflected unhappiness with the price, according to analysts. The deal
will be marginally dilutive, although it will result in an exceptional
profit of Pounds 45m.
'One would have thought they could have got more than Pounds 95m if they had
floated, given the current market conditions,' said Mr Mike Murphy, an
analyst with SG Warburg Securities.
However, Hanson defended the deal, saying the disposal carried the group
some way towards 'tidying up' its non-core UK operations.
The Electra-backed team is paying a multiple of just over seven times, based
on annual operating profits of Pounds 12.2m. Mr Tim Syder of Electra, who
will sit on the board of SLD Holdings as a non-executive director, said the
team was planning to invest in the businesses, which were all cash
generative.
Electra is providing Pounds 31.8m in funds and will have an 80 per cent
stake. The management team, led by Mr Les Ashford, chief executive of Hanson
Industrial Services (HIS), and Mr Neil Wilkinson, finance director of an HIS
subsidiary, is investing Pounds 400,000 for 20 per cent. The balance of the
payment will be met by Bank of Scotland and UBS, providing senior debt of
Pounds 47.5m, and Intermediate Capital Group, with mezzanine debt of Pounds
6m.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Granada extends bid for LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada, the rental, leisure and television group, yesterday extended its
Pounds 660m hostile offer for London Weekend Television for a further two
weeks.
At yesterday's first closing date, acceptances added only 2.39m shares, or
2.31 per cent of the target's equity, to those already held by Granada,
taking the total to 19.82 per cent. The new deadline is January 12.
The offer is based on six new Granada shares for every five LWT shares,
worth just over 640p a share at last night's close, with a cash alternative
of 528p. LWT closed up 2p at 625p yesterday.
Since Granada launched the bid on December 6, its share price has risen from
485p to 534p yesterday - down 1p on the day - adding about 10 per cent to
the value of the paper offer.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, said of the level of acceptances: 'I
am not even going to use the word derisory.' LWT is not expected to take any
further action until close to January 14, when it will provide a profit
estimate.
Sir Christopher has urged shareholders to stick with a 'pure' television
company rather than take the paper of 'a conglomerate earning half its
profits in a low growth sector'.
Talks are continuing with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees which could lead to an LWT
offer, although because one company can only hold two ITV licences a home
would have to be found for Tyne Tees. The deal envisages Anglia Television
taking over Tyne Tees in the hope that the four ITV franchises could
eventually be brought together to form a super ITV region.
Meanwhile Mr Gerry Robinson, the Granada chief executive, has said:
'Although we are in a number of different businesses, television will become
a much larger part of Granada.' He was speaking after last week's EGM which
approved the bid for LWT.
'This acquisition isn't going to make us a Paramount that's for sure. But we
think there will probably only be three major (ITV) players at the end of
the decade: ourselves, Carlton and MAI,' he added.
Carlton Communications has made an agreed bid for Central and MAI, the main
shareholder in Meridian Broadcasting, the south of England company, is
interested in expansion.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Quality queriedas flotation fatigue sets in: Maggie Urry
finds some overheating ahead of the next wave of new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new issues market badly needed the rest provided by the holiday season.
This year's flood of companies coming to the stock market has put such a
strain on investors that recent flotations have suffered.
There is every prospect of the rush resuming in the new year, with names
such as Dairy Crest, House of Fraser, Ashanti Goldfields, Beazer Homes and
Alpha Airports Group, part of Forte, lined up.
The overheating of the new issues market has meant that some recent issuers
have had to accept a lower price than they might have hoped for, while
others have withdrawn flotations.
The market's attack of indigestion was caused by a surfeit of issues in
November, and has been worsened by the inclusion of some unpalatable deals.
Quality control of new issues has become a worrying challenge for the City.
The excess of issues in November can be put down to companies waiting until
the summer holidays were over before starting the marketing build-up -
meaning the earliest float date would be in mid-October - while aiming to
squeeze in before the November 30 Budget. There were also a dozen issues
from companies set up to be corporate members of Lloyd's under the insurance
market's new rules. 'The market has seen six months worth of issues in six
weeks,' says one corporate financier.
The amount of money being demanded by flotations has not of itself been a
problem. New issues have called on about Pounds 5bn this year, while rights
issues have taken more than Pounds 11bn. But nearly all the issues have been
from companies regarded by professional fund managers as 'small', usually
consigned to specific small company funds. Their flotations have often been
primarily directed at institutional investors through placings.
Managers of small company funds have been inundated with requests from issue
sponsors to meet the companies' managements. One fund manager says: 'I have
to fight them off. I ask myself can I spare the time to see them? It's a
matter of doing a bit of quick desk research first.' He admits to dismissing
Celltech - a recent biotechnology issue which did not meet enthusiastic
support - on the grounds that 'I don't understand those sorts of things'.
The second problem, that of quality, is more serious. One merchant banker
puts it delicately: 'There have been a lot of issues this year which have
been not the highest quality and have been overpriced.'
The ease with which companies have floated and the prices obtained - usually
higher than could be achieved through a trade sale - has tempted more to
come to market. Within the total, bankers and brokers say, there are bound
to be a few less good businesses. 'There are always pearls among the swine,
you just have to be selective,' says the fund manager.
Investors' selectivity has left some companies attracting poor demand for
their shares. Some, such as Lilliput Group, which makes ornamental houses,
and Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator, saw the share price sink
below the issue price.
Others which floated before the summer lull have since warned on profits and
suffered share price falls. Drew Scientific, which makes diagnostic medical
kits, floated in May. In October Drew announced it would make a loss in the
six months to September 30, rather than the profit investors had expected.
It had been having problems since July with a component for its kits. 'None
of this was known when we issued the prospectus,' the chairman said. The
shares now stand at 63p, compared with the 105p issue price.
A similar tale came from Holliday Chemicals, which makes industrial dyes. It
floated in March at 195p and reported a slight fall in interim profits in
August. Last month it issued a warning about full-year profits and its share
have fallen to 160p.
The case which has upset investors most, though, was last month's collapse
into receivership of Swithland Group less than two weeks after the car
dealer had failed in its attempt to float. It became clear the group needed
the cash it would have raised from the issue simply to survive. The issue,
which was not underwritten, did not attract sufficient demand to go ahead.
Sponsors of issues, usually merchant banks or stockbrokers, have always
given an implicit seal of approval to an issue simply by putting their name
to it. From December 1, though, the London Stock Exchange's listing rules
changed, increasing sponsors' responsibilities while allowing a wider range
of advisers to act as sponsors.
They are now required to write a formal letter to the exchange confirming
that the listing rules have been complied with - which includes ensuring
that 'proper disclosure' has been made. If a sponsor is found to have broken
its obligations, the exchange can censure it, disqualify it from acting as a
sponsor and publish the reasons. A sponsor could jeopardise its reputation
if it brought a company to market which later proved to have misled
investors in its prospectus.
In public sponsors say they are unconcerned about the new letters which,
they protest, only formalise an existing commitment to supervise issues
properly. Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listings at the exchange, says he hopes
the new letters will make sponsors more responsible.
Even before the rule change, he says, the exchange has made a point of
following up cases such as profit warnings soon after a float. Advisers are
given a 'hard time' over the due diligence they carried out when preparing
the prospectus.
If next year's bout of new issues is to find a receptive market, sponsors
will have to show more restraint in picking the companies they are prepared
to bring to market. And investors must continue to be vigilant in examining
the prospectuses and grilling the management.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Gota Bank seeks damages from former board members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's Gota Bank will today open a civil court action to demand damages
from former board members in the government's latest attempt to hold bank
executives and directors accountable for the loan loss crisis that hit the
financial system last year.
The Bank Support Authority (BSA), the state agency established to manage the
crisis, said the suit - relating to loan activity during 1990 - would be
filed against several former directors in the Stockholm district court.
Gota Bank was one of the biggest victims of the bank shock. It was taken
over by the state after running up credit losses of SKr13bn (Pounds 1bn) in
1992. It is to be merged with Nordbanken, also taken over by the state, on
January 1 after a rescue and recapitalisation operation that has cost
taxpayers SKr30.4bn.
Mr Stefan Ingves, chief executive of the BSA, said further investigations of
loan practice at Gota Bank during 1991 and 1992 were under way. The
government, as shareholder, has also refused to absolve Gota directors of
their legal responsibilities during 1992 pending a separate inquiry into the
management of the bank.
Meanwhile, the BSA is still in dispute with the Gota parent company over the
worth of the bank at the time of the government takeover. The BSA claimed
the bank was only worth SKr1.
Last week, a former chairman of Nordbanken, four former senior executives
and several former board members agreed collectively to pay the government
SKr16m - partly made up of 'golden parachutes' paid to them when they left
the bank - in a settlement in which they admitted wrongdoing in the
administration of loans during 1990.
In addition, the state prosecution office is scrutinising 156 individual
loans worth SKr37.8bn made by all the leading banks except Svenska
Handelsbanken, on suspicion of criminal malpractice. No charges have yet
been brought.
The bank crisis erupted after a spate of bad loans, mainly related to
property. The banks have improved performance this year, but the government
has committed SKr92.1bn in bail-outs. It has also put SKr110bn of Gota Bank
and Nordbanken's bad loans in so-called 'bad banks', which will remain in
state hands after Nordbanken is re-privatised.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel's coyness about the value of its extended concession is a little
irritating. Still, while the present value of an extra 10 years of revenues
50 years from now is doubtless modest, the company has resolved another of
its apparently infinite number of disputes. That alone should be enough to
boost the shares when the market has the chance to offer its verdict. On the
other side, the pain of forgone revenues to governments who find planning
over five years difficult is presumably zero. The settlement may also
reassure those considering private-public joint ventures that the government
can be reasonable, provided it does not cost real money.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to the first closing date of Granada's bid Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's
chairman, has done little more than talk a good fight. The much-rumoured
defensive alliances have not yet materialised, perhaps because shareholders
would spit out anything which tasted like a poisoned pill. LWT's strongest
argument - that its fancy media rating might be swamped by Granada's sprawl
 -may not be enough to save it. Even given the current enthusiasm for the
sector, there is a hefty bid premium in LWT's share price. Shareholders
eventually may be tempted to accept the offer rather than risk allowing
their windfall profits to slip away. LWT will have to come up with something
more solid if it is to get the decision.

FT  30 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The business plan for Euro Disney is in suspended animation while the
accountants check that the company's famous imagination has not run away
with it. Serious negotiation between the company and its banks will thus
have to wait for the hard numbers. Yet Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's
chairman, seems happy to carry on with his campaign of megaphone diplomacy
in the meantime. The banks have to weigh the damage to the Disney image if
it walked away from the park against the parent company's very limited
financial exposure. So Mr Eisner has every reason to soften the banks up as
much as possible. He also has a much more frightening audience closer to
home. Walt Disney stockholders are already grumbling about their chairman
handing out money to European banks.
Still, some battle lines are clear. Euro Disney's operational cash flow is
slightly positive, and some further cost savings may be possible. But in the
absence of a strong upturn in attendances, the park is not going to generate
enough cash to service any great quantity of debt or equity. It is hard to
see a rights issue raising more than FFr5bn-FFr6bn, since that would require
at least a one-for-one issue. Even that would not cut Euro Disney's FFr21bn
debt by enough to put the park on a firm footing. A write-off of a further
FFr5bn of bank debt would still leave the company in loss for 1993-94, but
would offer hope thereafter. The banks, however, are likely to want equity
in return, further diluting existing shareholders. To put any sparkle of
value back into the shares, a fairy godmother will have to acquire the
park's half-empty hotels.

FT  30 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As has become the tradition of the season, forecasts abound about the
housing market. Some estimates suggest prices in prime areas of London may
rise by 25 per cent next year. Other predictions point to double-digit
growth. In relative terms, houses are more affordable than for decades. The
average house price to earnings ratio is at the lower end of its historical
range. Interest rates could fall further while unemployment is drifting
downwards. That will reinforce the confidence of prospective buyers with the
demographic squeeze doing the rest.
But that is perhaps to underestimate the pressure on real incomes that Mr
Kenneth Clarke has administered in his Budget. Earnings inflation cannot be
counted upon to stimulate the market as it has in the past. Prices have
stopped falling and are starting to edge upwards. But negative equity,
higher deposits and the greater scrutiny of lending will keep the speed of
recovery in check. A recent study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
estimated that 26 per cent of the homes bought between 1988 and 1991 were
worth less than the mortgages used to buy them. The Halifax survey
predicting a 15 per cent increase in volume but only a 5 per cent increase
in price seems the most plausible estimate.

FT  30 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Banesto's capital question
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Spain's intervention at Banesto will have raised the temperature
of many Milwaukee insurance fund managers to boiling point. Those US funds
which helped sink Dollars 775m of rights issue money into Banesto this
summer will be appalled by the sudden turn of events. Investors were
persuaded by JP Morgan that once Banesto's complex web of
cross-share-holdings had been untangled, a strong retail bank would emerge
boasting good recovery prospects. Banks have certainly been European flavour
of the year, as the successful privatisation of Argentaria among others
illustrates.
Banesto's fall seems to owe more to its own shaky loan portfolio and
peculiar collection of industrial assets than any general weaknesses in the
Spanish banking system. Yet there remain many unanswered questions - not
least why the Bank of Spain chose this moment to intervene. Banesto had long
lingered below the capital ratios of other Spanish banks and the Bank had
been monitoring its financial health for some time. This raises the
suspicion that there is some more specific bad news to come. JP Morgan's
seeming ignorance is particularly baffling, given its seat on the board. It
invested some of its reputation in Banesto along with its own and its
clients' money. There will be red faces aplenty at the blue chip bank.
Banesto cannot hope to continue operating in its present form. The new
management will have its work cut out rationalising overhead costs to
squeeze cash flow and seeking buyers for its industrial businesses. The most
likely outcome is that a single Spanish bank, such as BBV, or a broader
consortium will eventually assume control. The reaction of the Madrid stock
market in dumping shares across the sector shows how nervous it is about the
prospect.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Arafat sees Mubarak as Israel-PLO talks hit deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, last
night held urgent talks in Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak after Israel
and the PLO failed to break the deadlock in peace talks.
Egyptian officials said that, in the half-hour meeting, Mr Arafat reacted
positively to some of the Israeli proposals on plans for its already delayed
troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
Mr Mubarak, who is believed to have requested Mr Arafat's trip to Egypt, was
expected to press the PLO chairman to soften his stance. But Mr Tayeb
Abdel-Rahim, the PLO's ambassador to Jordan, said Mr Arafat had gone to
Cairo with a formal rejection of 'humiliating' Israeli proposals.
The two sides had earlier given conflicting statements about progress in the
Cairo negotiations aimed at implementing the Israeli withdrawal.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said the two sides had reached
broad agreement but would need more talks. Israeli officials said they had
offered their last compromise position.
At a press conference with Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO's chief negotiator, Mr
Peres said: 'The two delegations have reached a meeting of the minds on the
central issues of border crossings, the size of Jericho and matters relating
to the Gaza Strip. The leadership of the two parties will now have to accept
or reject this paper.'
A more downbeat Mr Abbas said: 'The negotiations were constructive. There
were some ideas that will be discussed . . . and we hope to reach an
agreement.'
The failure of the talks came amid growing signs of a crisis in the PLO
leadership over strategy and mounting criticism by rank-and-file
Palestinians of the lack of consultation by Mr Arafat.
An hour before the Cairo press conference, the PLO executive committee
issued a statement in Tunis rejecting the latest Israeli proposals. It
insisted that Palestinians must have total control of crossings between Gaza
and Egypt and between the Jericho enclave and Jordan.
The committee blamed Israel for obstructing the negotiations and withdrawing
previous offers.
The Tunis statement fuelled speculation that Mr Arafat was deliberately
undercutting the position of Mr Abbas. Mr Abbas is reportedly in favour of a
softer negotiating stance and a greater democratisation of the PLO.
Mr Peres also appeared to indicate that the obstacle to an agreement was Mr
Arafat rather than the PLO delegation.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Eurotunnel drops Pounds 1bn suit against UK, France: Deal
gives operator 10 more years to run tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel is to drop most of its estimated Pounds 500m-Pounds 1bn of claims
against the British and French governments in return for winning an extra 10
years on its concession to operate the Channel tunnel. The concession will
now end in 2052.
The deal between Eurotunnel and the two governments, announced last night,
clears the way for Eurotunnel to complete negotiations with its bankers for
additional funding to cover start-up costs for the tunnel, which opens in
March.
'It's a deal, and yet another settlement of an open issue, about which we
can be pretty pleased,' Eurotunnel said. A French government official said:
'This largely resolves the outstanding issues between the French and British
governments and Eurotunnel.'
The cost of the tunnel has risen from Pounds 6bn in 1987 to about Pounds
10bn, partly because of the costs incurred by Eurotunnel on safety, security
and environmental measures demanded by the two governments.
Eurotunnel had intended to make claims against them to recover the costs.
'In the past six years the tunnel has evolved significantly, and in costly
fashion,' it said.
Under a deal agreed in principle on Christmas Eve and signed yesterday,
Eurotunnel's concession is extended from 55 to 65 years, running from
enactment of the Channel Tunnel Act in 1987.
In exchange, Eurotunnel will drop most of its intended claims. It would
still have to find the whole cost of the project.
The agreement should facilitate, and is conditional upon, Eurotunnel raising
enough finance to start operations.
Eurotunnel has raised about Pounds 8.95bn, but has said it needs at least
another Pounds 1bn, mainly to cover debt servicing before the tunnel begins
to break even on a cash basis in 1998.
It has to reach agreement with its banks by January 4 on the financing plan
for the Pounds 1bn, of which at least Pounds 500m should come from a rights
issue in spring 1994.
The latest deal comes a month after a CDollars 746m claim over cost overruns
was settled between Bombardier, a Canadian supplier of trains for the tunnel
Shuttle services, and Transmanche Link, the main contractor.
In July, TML itself and Eurotunnel ended their long conflict over who should
be responsible for heavy cost overruns.
The only remaining issue involves Eurotunnel's claims against British Rail
and France's SNCF.

FT  30 DEC 93 / High street banks want card groups to join clearing body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High street banks are to invite credit and debit card payment groups such as
Visa and Switch to join their body responsible for cheque and cash clearing.
An internal study has raised concerns about growing competition from payment
systems not run by banks.
The effort to bring credit and debit payments under the Association for
Payment Clearing Services umbrella follows the collapse of the banks'
attempt in the 1980s to create Eftpos, a single clearing and settlement
system for debit cards.
Since the collapse of the Eftpos initiative in 1989, the largest
co-operative effort involving credit and debit cards within Apacs has been
the joint initiative to reduce fraud. Card payments are now settled by rival
card groups, although they are cleared through banks.
After a study which has also led banks to allow mutual or sub-contracted
processing of cheques and credit vouchers to save costs, Apacs has now
decided to try to extend membership to outside clearing and payment groups,
notably the card payment organisations.
The unpublished study says it believes that 'there would be benefits to such
organisations from having a stronger relationship with Apacs, and that most
would wish to do so, provided the balance of rights and obligations was
sensible, and there was a level playing field'.
The study argues that the 'orderly development' of the payments industry is
fundamental to maintaining standards such as avoiding fraud. However, it
points out that the membership of international payments systems has
mushroomed in the past decade, leading to far greater diversity.
It predicts 'fierce competition' throughout the 1990s between the leading
payments systems and networks including Visa, Mastercard and the bank-owned
Swift international payments network, as well as third party processing
companies such as Sligos.
Apacs executives say they have no intention of trying to revive Eftpos,
which collapsed after the launch of Barclays' Connect debit card and the
formation of the Switch consortium.
Mr Andrew Malecki, head of strategy and planning, said there was 'zero
chance' of Apacs trying to set up a single national clearing and settlement
system for plastic cards.
Mr Malecki said Apacs' ruling council had approved the strategy set out in
the study of association of embracing 'a wide range of payment clearing and
settlement activities and organisations', but it had not set precise terms
for the admission of new members.
Some Apacs executives believe the association would have to admit card
groups on more flexible terms than in the past because organisations such as
Visa and Mastercard have international memberships, and constitutions which
would be difficult to change.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Tarnish ruins the rosy picture: John Gapper examines the
global and domestic implications of the failure of Spain's fourth-largest
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As predictions went, it was one of the less reliable of 1993. Mr Mario
Conde, the flamboyant chairman of Spain's fourth-largest bank, was
explaining why investors should trust him. Spain's central bank had just
inspected the books and told Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) to
reclassify Pta41bn (Pounds 200.98m) of loans as bad. There was nothing left
to fear, he argued.
'If I was an investor looking at Banesto after this, I would think there
were no asset quality surprises after such an intensive inspection. Nothing
is going to happen like it happened in 1987 when we had to reclassify
Pta100bn of bad debts,' said Mr Conde. He was speaking in September; on
Tuesday, his prediction was brutally disproved.
The Bank of Spain moved swiftly this week when shares in Banesto tumbled
because investors' fears were growing over the bank's loan portfolio and its
equity holdings in a wide range of industrial companies. It briskly sacked
Banesto's board - including a vice-chairman of J. P. Morgan, the US
corporate bank which has handled Banesto's raising of capital - and replaced
them with its own management. It also said Banesto would be restructured
using money from bank deposit insurance funds.
Such actions signal the biggest state intervention to prop up a private bank
since the Scandinavian banking crisis of 1991. Banesto's size alone means it
will have repercussions for both Spanish banking and the American investors
who put money into it on the advice of J. P. Morgan. Banesto is the
96th-largest bank in the world, with assets of Dollars 61bn.
But Banesto's collapse failure has significance beyond its size. It poses
questions about the ability of banks with large industrial cross-holdings to
survive recessions. For instance, the Japanese banking system, probably the
most troubled in the world at the moment, has been affected not only by
asset price falls, but by a drop in the value of securities holdings.
Banesto's fate is also a reminder of the difficulty of assessing the value
of Spanish banks. This is because of their webs of cross-holdings and the
opaque nature of Spanish accounting. American investors relied on J. P.
Morgan to point the way through these complications to the underlying
potential of Banesto. Some may feel their faith was misguided.
Finally, the intervention places a question-mark over the apparently
inexorable process by which brokers expect continental European banks to
follow those of the US and Britain in recovering from the recessions which
followed bad lending in the 1980s. Investors expecting shares in all weak
banks to rebound strongly may have second thoughts.
Mr Rod Barrett, a European banks analyst for Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank, argues that the anticipated reward of investing in Banesto
never appeared high enough. 'It always seemed to be quite a high-risk
vehicle without a huge reward, and now it turns out that the risk was higher
than we thought,' he says. Yet global investors have grown accustomed to
banks being safe bets as economies have started to recover from recesssion.
This expectation is one reason why American pension funds, among others,
were willing to commit money to a bank which had long been regarded in
Madrid as second-rate. Banesto shares had performed poorly for several years
because of doubts about its underlying value, and because of scepticism
about Mr Conde's ability to turn the bank around.
For new US investors, the picture painted by J. P. Morgan, which both
advised Banesto and invested Dollars 175m of capital from the Corsair
investment fund it manages, was familiar. Banesto was portrayed by J. P.
Morgan as a retail bank recovering from lending problems. It was under-rated
because it was enmeshed in a tangle of cross-holdings that could be stripped
away, supporters said.
Seen in such a light, Banesto was an opportunity for rapid capital gains.
The latest country to stage a banking recovery is the UK, where banks have
performed strongly on the London stock market in the past year. The fastest
risers have been the worst-hit banks such as Barclays, which made a loss in
1992.
Spain has been seen by some brokers as a natural successor to the US and UK
in terms of banking recovery. Spanish retail banks have comparatively high
margins because of the conservatism of depositors. It is also a more
concentrated market than some others, with the top five banks having a 30
per cent market share. These factors reinforced Banesto's attractions.
Investors seized their opportunity when J. P. Morgan managed a two-part
equity-raising exercise last May. They bought some Dollars 775m of new
equity in Banesto, which was used to restore the bank's capital to the
levels of competitors. J. P. Morgan took Dollars 175m on behalf of its
Corsair fund, which was set up in the US to buy the shares of just such
undervalued banks.
But Banesto turned out not to fall into the category of a steadily
recovering bank after all. The first clue to what lay ahead came a week ago
when it shelved a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue planned to complete
the Dollars 1.1bn capital-raising exercise. But there were several reasons
why it was difficult for investors to discern the problems earlier:
Despite J. P. Morgan's vision of its future, Banesto was not purely a retail
bank. It controls both the 2,200-branch bank and a holding company with
stakes in real estate, mining, and gases companies. Banesto has been trying
to cut such holdings both to meet a Bank of Spain regulatory limit, and to
release capital to use in banking.
However, divestment could mean losses for Banesto if it holds the stakes in
its books at a higher value than it could sell them for. This is why banks
with similar equity holdings are at greater risk from recessions than those
which only hold loans. It is unclear how much the Bank of Spain was worried
by Banesto's cross-holdings.
Mr Conde has been at odds with the political and financial establishment of
Spain since he took over Banesto at the end of 1987. Some of his supporters
argue that the Bank of Spain has been more strict with Banesto than others
as a result. Controversy over Mr Conde made it more difficult for new
investors to assess management competence.
Banesto has admitted to painting a rosy picture of itself in the past.
Speaking in September, Mr Conde said that he was unwilling to tell
shareholders the whole truth about Banesto's plight in 1987, because 'they
would have left the bank'. The fact that Mr Conde had been economical with
the truth in the past made it harder to accept his words at face value.
These factors meant that investors placed more weight on the judgment of J.
P. Morgan's executives. Mr Barrett says that several investors in this
year's capital issues told him they had initially taken the view that 'what
is good enough for J. P. Morgan is good enough for us'.
Mr Mendoza, J. P. Morgan vice-chairman, who was on Banesto's board as a
representative of the Corsair fund, emphasised in September that J. P.
Morgan had examined Banesto closely because of such complications. 'We spent
a tremendous amount of time convincing ourselves that there was substance
and truth there,' he said.
It is not yet clear whether J. P. Morgan inadvertently gave investors a
false picture of Banesto's state of health in the first half of last year,
or whether the condition of the Spanish bank worsened substantially in the
second half. Mr Barrett says he was 'alarmed' at Banesto's third quarter
provisions against poor loans as recession deepened.
But the implications of Banesto's failure extend beyond the degree to which
J. P. Morgan's reputation suffers. It could damage the investment potential
of Spanish companies, since investors may regard Spain's accounting
principles and company structures as too risky. They could prove much harder
to reassure in future after Mr Conde's lapse.

FT  30 DEC 93 / US bank tries to distance itself from troubled partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J P. Morgan has enjoyed a reputation for quality which is the envy of other
US bankers. So it was with interest - and not a little glee - that other US
financiers have watched the US's most prestigious bank become embroiled in
Banesto's difficulties.
In hard financial terms, the Spanish bank's problems will to have little
impact on J. P. Morgan. It is thought to have invested Dollars 17.5m
indirectly in the bank through the Corsair fund, a specialist limited
partnership it created to invest in bank stocks. But the fact that J. P.
Morgan, with its blue-chip reputation, was so closely linked with the bank
will have greater repercussions.
Banesto, an outsider in the Spanish banking establishment, did not appear a
natural partner for J. P. Morgan. 'This was not a Morganesque institution,'
said Mr George Salem, banking analyst at Prudential Securities.
A second concern has been the extent to which J. P. Morgan allowed itself to
become enmeshed in Banesto. This is likely to prompt questions about how the
bank handled possible conflicts of interest.
In February Corsair, a J. P. Morgan-sponsored bank 'vulture fund', took a
Dollars 175m stake in the bank. Such funds aim to buy shares in troubled
companies which they believe are undervalued and benefit from a share-price
rebound. Then, in the spring and summer, J. P. Morgan led international
equity issues for Banesto totalling about Dollars 775m. And Mr Robert
Mendoza, one of four J. P. Morgan vice-chairmen, had a seat on Banesto's
board.
J. P. Morgan appeared yesterday to be distancing itself from Corsair. One
financial institution which made inquiries of J. P. Morgan yesterday said
the bank disclaimed responsibility for the fund. 'They bragged about it when
they launched it, so they can't disown it now,' the institution said.
By denting J. P. Morgan's reputation, the Banesto debacle could hurt its
attempts to build an investment banking business. J. P. Morgan has been in
the van of US commercial banks seeking to extend their involvement into the
capital markets. It has only a small presence in the US underwriting
business, handling 3.2 per cent of corporate debt issues and 1.5 per cent of
equity issues this year, according to Securities Data. But its presence in
US capital markets is still more substantial than any other US commercial
bank.
Institutions like the GE pension fund and Northwestern Mutual Life, the
eighth-biggest US life company, were large holders in Banesto. The bank's
problems, coming so soon after J. P. Morgan promoted its shares, are likely
to harm the bank's relationships with such prominent US institutions.
While US investors are thought to have been among the biggest buyers of
Banesto's stock in rights issues led by J. P. Morgan this year, several
institutions said Banesto's problems would not affect their involvement in
international equity markets. The GE pension fund, with about 1.5 per cent
of the bank's stock, said it would not change its plans.
A portfolio of European bank stocks would still show a considerable gain
this year even after the Banesto problems, said Mr John Hickling, an
international portfolio manager with Fidelity Investments, the biggest US
mutual funds group.
'Clearly retail investors are throwing money at a lot of things - most
recently it's been the emerging markets funds. Those are the things that
really terrify me,' he added.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Banesto and after
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Back in July Spain's fourth largest bank, Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto), raised about Dollars 775m from international and domestic
investors. The offer, to which the highly respected US bank J. P. Morgan
lent its imprimatur, was a notable success. Yet within less than five months
Banesto has had to be rescued by the Bank of Spain. Its directors have this
week been unceremoniously hoofed out and nominees of the central bank put in
their place to restructure the institution. J. P. Morgan's name is a little
less illustrious. Such an abrupt reversal of fortune and reputation is a
matter of concern not only to investors in Banesto, but to the wider
financial community.
As yet, details of the deterioration in Banesto's finances remain scarce. To
that extent, all conclusions must be provisional at this stage. Yet it is
clear that the scale of the increased provisions required to cover the fall
in the value of its assets would leave it substantially in breach of the
central bank's capital adequacy requirements. That is the only possible
interpretation of the Bank of Spain's decision to provide a guarantee of
liquidity in domestic and foreign markets. The more difficult questions
concern the speed of the deterioration, and the failure of J. P. Morgan to
see what was coming.
Representatives of the US bank repeatedly described Banesto as a low-risk
investment. Yet by conventional banking standards its balance sheet was
fundamentally unsound. As the owner of Spain's biggest private sector
industrial holding company, it was excessively exposed to fluctuations in
the value of its share stakes in large Spanish companies. Indeed, the formal
documents to the flotation in July emphasised that a majority of the
companies in this industrial portfolio were in basic industries
characterised by high fixed costs and volatile earnings.
Industrial exposure
Banesto's industrial exposure was, in fact, in excess of the Bank of Spain's
required ceiling. But it had been given until 1998 to reduce these holdings
to the appropriate extent. It was bound to remain vulnerable as long as this
old-fashioned industrial banking structure remained in place. An increase in
provisions against the fall in the value of these investments will no doubt
prove to be one of the factors that has led to the rescue.
Another will be the deterioration in the loan book due to the recession in
Spain. While Banesto is predominantly a retail bank, it is heavily exposed
to the small and medium-sized businesses that suffer disproportionately in
any downturn. Moreover, an aggressive management had expanded the loan book
very rapidly at the peak of a protracted and euphoric economic upturn. This
ill-timed dash for market share inevitably leaves Banesto in weaker shape
than many of its rivals.
Warning signs
Other tell-tale warning signs were the readiness of the management, under Mr
Mario Conde, to alienate the Bank of Spain, which would have preferred
Banesto to find a partner in one of the country's more healthy banking
groups. Mr Conde's reluctance to accommodate an institution that wields
draconian power over the Spanish banking system cannot have helped his case.
While there is a widespread suspicion that the Bank of Spain has treated
Banesto with unusual severity, there must also be a question mark over the
quality of banking supervision. Banesto was subjected to an inspection of
supposedly unusual rigour a year ago. In the light of this week's events, it
looks as though the inspectors may not have been quite as rigorous as they
should have been.
The problems of international investors in Banesto are probably best seen as
an inevitable part of the learning process in cross-border investment.
Banking practice in continental Europe, despite its apparent profitability,
is not always quite what it seems to the foreign observer. Spanish
accounting is notoriously opaque and the worth of an audit report, despite
the familiarity of an internationally known company's name, can vary
substantially from country to country. There will be more upsets in
cross-border banking deals, just as there will be financial scandals in
emerging stock markets. The surprise with Banesto lies more in the blow to
J. P. Morgan's reputation than the rescue of the bank itself.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Letter From New Delhi: United in poverty, divided by fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rizwana Begum clutches the youngest of her five small children in her arms
and says: 'My husband is dead. I must bring up the children alone. What else
can I do?'
Mrs Rizwana's husband was killed a year ago when a mob broke into their hut
in Seelampur, a slum in north-east Delhi, and dragged him out. His throat
was slashed and his body set alight. 'I saw him being pulled out,' says Mrs
Rizwana. 'I did not see him alive again.'
Mrs Rizwana, who is aged about 30, recalls the most frightening day of her
life almost without emotion - even for her, time has done its work, easing
the memory of her husband's death.
So it is in much of the rest of Janata Colony, the poorest corner of
Seelampur, where two-thirds of the residents are Moslems living in huts
crammed into narrow lanes. A year ago, after the sacking of the mosque in
far-off Ayodhya by Hindu militants, Hindu mobs went on the rampage in
Seelampur burning and looting. Moslems fought back, but in vain, because,
they claim, the mainly Hindu police sided with the rioters. All 23 dead were
Moslems, as were 22 of 23 seriously injured. The bulk of the 300 homes and
workshops destroyed belonged to Moslems.
Today, like Mrs Rizwana, Moslems and Hindus alike try to carry on with life.
Living cheek-by-jowl, sharing the same paths and the same water pumps, they
can hardly do otherwise. Poverty unites them in a way that even the most
enormous injustices cannot destroy. A few hundred people fled from their
homes immediately after the riots; but almost all returned in a few days.
They had nowhere else to go.
Yet these are no longer people living at peace with each other - or with
themselves. There is a fear, especially among Moslems, that the militants
might return. Mr Anish Ahmed, a 37-year-old Moslem tailor, says: 'Right now
things are fine. But every time a firecracker goes off we worry.'
The Moslems say they are not scared of their Hindu neighbours, only of the
outsiders who led the mob last time and could come back. Local Hindus also
say that the trouble-makers were all strangers. They add that they did not
see who they were or what they did. 'We went away to hide,' says Mr Tara
Singh, a plasterer, and his Hindu friends nod their heads in agreement.
Among the outsiders blamed for stirring trouble are activists from militant
Hindu organisations led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has made great
strides in popularity in the past decade. Mr B L Sharma, the BJP, MP from
East Delhi, who has spent his life promoting Hindu militancy, denies that
Hindus have been stirring trouble in Seelampur. Moslems suffered in the
riots, he says, because they took to the streets against the police - a
version of events rejected by local people, Hindus and Moslems alike.
'Moslems must learn to respect the sentiments of the Hindu majority. Then
they can live in peace,' says Mr Sharma, resorting to the sophistry employed
by his party's militants.
Fortunately for peace in Seelampur, the BJP fared badly in the recent
state-level elections in northern India. Mohammed Abid, a 20-year-old
tailor, says: 'Here, even the Hindus voted against the BJP. How can we fight
with Hindus when we are all neighbours.'
Walking around Seelampur, it is difficult to make out which houses were
damaged - new ones have gone up in their place and it does not take long to
build a two-room hut. Also, the heat, sun and dust soon remove the veneer of
newness from these rough-built homes. Even in the timber yard, scene of the
worst damage a year ago, most burnt-out workshops have been rebuilt. In
place of the smell of blackened timber there is the fresh scent of new-cut
wood.
Almost everywhere people are sitting in the street, working - tailors,
embroiderers, carpenters, butchers and collectors of cow-dung - crammed into
the narrow lanes. Some earn as little as Rs5 (Pounds 0.16p) a day - just
enough to survive on bread, rice and vegetables.
Poverty makes riot compensation a big issue. A handful of people whose close
relatives were killed, including the widow Mrs Rizwana, have received
one-off grants of up to Rs200,000. But those who suffered damage to property
claim they received far less than they lost. A tailor with sewing and
cutting machines in his workshop asks: 'What is Rs20,000 compensation for
those who lost Rs2m?'
The People's Movement for Secularism, a charity working in Seelampur, says
just 35 of 386 claims made to the government have been settled. Those still
waiting include the families of 12 of the dead - their claims are disputed
because the victims were killed by police bullets. Such fatalities are
classified as rioters and are ineligible for compensation - unless their
innocence can be proved, a difficult challenge when few witnesses are ready
to come forward.
Mr J K Sharma, the district commissioner of police for Seelampur, says he
wishes the government would settle the claims more quickly. 'The
law-and-order situation now is fine,' he says. Autumn, with its many Hindu
and Moslem religious festivals, passed without incident. 'If people were
still angry we would have seen protests. But there weren't any.'
Mr Abid, the Moslem tailor, says that no matter what the injustices, life
has to go on. 'I've lived here 16 years. I'm staying and I will bring up my
children here.' Mr Abid is captain of the local cricket team. He has five
Hindus and seven Moslems in his squad. Some 200-300 spectators come to
matches, Hindus and Moslems. There has never been any trouble, he says, and
he hopes there never will be.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Wild ride comes to abrupt halt for Spanish maverick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mario Conde has, so far, had a knack for landing on his feet. Few had heard
of him six years ago when he and a friend sold their pharmaceuticals company
Antibioticos to Montedison for Pta58bn (Pounds 280m).
The money from that transaction bought him a stake in Banesto and, very
quickly, he became president of the board. With it came a wild ride as one
of the biggest beneficiaries of the economic boom that transformed the
country after it entered the European Community in 1986, and now as one of
the losers of the subsequent recession.
By character, Mario Conde is far from the epitome of an international
banker. He brushes his hair back so that it curls slightly in the nape of
his neck. When he first got to Banesto he spoke English with an English
accent. Gradually it changed to an American twang, reflecting a change in
teacher but also in priorities as he became more enchanted with the new
world.
Critics doubted whether he would make an effective banker because his
background had been as an industrialist. But his answer was that switching
from industry to banking was little more than a change of management
challenges.
He achieved some big successes at Banesto, unravelling the chaotic
interweaving shareholdings held by the bank's old squabbling owning families
into a reasonably recognisable set of institutions.
But he was never quite understood by Spain's financial establishment. He
sailed a boat sponsored by Banesto and flew around in a private jet and
bought himself a vast finca, or ranch, to hunt on. However he remained a
very private person.
His abrupt dismissal as president of Banesto on Tuesday by the Bank of Spain
will have shocked him. But he has a personal interest in fighting back hard:
he had recently invested Dollars 50m of his own money in Banesto.
The son of a Galician customs officer, Mr Conde, 45, won one of the highest
marks ever in national law exams in 1973. He is a Freemason who inspires
loyalty among his staff.
In spite of that, he had a habit of losing friends and potential allies. He
alienated the Bank of Spain by, for instance, criticising auditing practices
demanded by the central bank, and could be frustratingly vague about what he
wanted to do with Banesto. When asked whether he would sell all its
industrial holdings or not, he would reply only: 'Everything has its price.'
One mistake - aside from trying to run a troublesome bank - was to allow
himself to be construed in the serious media as a man with a political
brain, a possible white knight for the political right wing once Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez leaves office. It meant he lacked friends in the
government. He took Banesto into big media investments but found himself
blamed for attacks on the government by newspapers he controlled.
Perhaps his darkest moment before Tuesday was in 1989 when he became
involved in a Machiavellian tussle to merge Banesto with Banco Central, a
large competing bank, and thus rid Central from the grip of 'Los Albertos',
two equally hard nosed entrepreneurs who were threatening to take over
Central.
Los Albertos eventually walked away from Central to become prosperous future
owners of the smaller but healthier Banco Zaragozano, a fate Mr Conde might
have wished had been his.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Leading Article: China unifies exchange rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The precise timing of China's decision to unify its exchange rate seems to
have come as a surprise to some observers. What is more, the full
implications remain vague. None the less, the decision is welcome, not only
in itself, but for the indication it gives that Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier
in charge of the economy and central bank governor, is able and willing to
push needed reforms ahead. These must now be pushed further, in a number of
directions.
Unification of the exchange rate was a logical step. The only question was
when it would be taken. At present, China has two exchange rates: an
official rate of 5.8 yuan to the dollar and a floating rate of Yn8.7. The
latter is not fully unified, however. It is set in a network of 100 regional
'swap centres', which were established in 1987 and remain incompletely
linked to one another.
Until now companies had to sell 20 per cent of their foreign exchange
earnings to the state at the official rate, while the government had the
right to buy another 30 per cent at the swap rate. The rest could either be
retained or sold directly or indirectly, via so-called foreign exchange
entitlements, in the swap markets. Those markets are far from free: not only
does the government use the 50 per cent of foreign exchange it still
controls to influence the rates, but access to these markets is also
restricted.
Economic liberalisation
Despite these limitations, the introduction of the swap markets has made an
important contribution to economic liberalisation. Already some 80 per cent
of current account transactions are done at the swap rate. The official rate
is used to tax exporters and foreign tourists. It also taxes foreign
investors, who had to register capital in new ventures at the official rate,
but were required to repatriate profits at the swap rate. At the same time,
the official rate is used to subsidise imports by government organs,
including state-owned enterprises, although the latter have been
increasingly forced to use the swap market.
Unifying the exchange rate will eliminate an important source of economic
inefficiency, promote China's integration within the global market economy
and shift management of the economy further towards uniform, market-oriented
instruments and away from administrative discretion. Nevertheless, the move
could have disruptive consequences.
The US might, mistakenly, see a reduction in the official rate as predatory.
The shift might also be condemned as inflationary, though effects on prices
are, in fact, likely to be negligible. More significantly, the move will
increase financial pressure on loss-making state enterprises and the
government itself, for which improvements in tax collection will become
still more important. But making subsidies more transparent may also make it
politically easier to reduce them.
Administrative reforms
The fundamental question, however, is how far the implications have been
thought through. At present those requiring to convert foreign exchange into
yuan, or vice versa, have only a limited idea of how the system - which is
to go into effect in just two days time - is to work. The International
Monetary Fund is already involved in a programme to integrate 18 leading
swap centres. There are also efforts under way to create an inter-bank
foreign exchange market. Such administrative reforms must now be
accelerated.
Also urgent will be elimination of most restrictions on imports, important
for China's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
further liberalisation of access to foreign exchange. Last but not least,
orthodox monetary policy will become the principal tool for management of
the exchange rate, something the authorities must never forget. China is
becoming a normal market economy. This means development of a
market-oriented monetary system. But to be effective it must be backed up by
fiscal reform and fiscal restraint.
China's reforms always come in a higgledy-piggledy manner. This is another
example. But it does mark a significant stage on the way to the market.
China has a long way to go, but the direction remains clear, as does the
stunning economic success that has attended its journey this far.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: In defence of conglomerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your comments on Williams Holdings ('The first fruits of a strategy
change', and Lex column, December 22) display a lack of understanding of
diversified companies. Why does Lex refer to Williams' 'sprawling empire'
when BTR, recently voted Britain's best managed company, has more than 1,000
businesses across a broader range of industries? Why does Lex say that
because Fairey, Williams' bridges business, 'generates erratic profit' it
'needs a large parent'? Does this mean all companies with volatile earnings
should have large parents? Why is it implied Williams is doing the right
thing 'with its transition from a conglomerate to a more focused group of
businesses'?
These comments misunderstand how Williams has grown from nothing to a market
capitalisation of nearly Pounds 2bn in less than 10 years. It has been a
specialist in turning round and upgrading businesses through expert
parenting of manufacturing and operations. Similar to BTR, but with a more
hands-on approach, Williams has exploited situations where existing managers
are under-performing. Why then is Nigel Rudd, Williams' chairman, changing
strategy? Is it because there are few under-performing opportunities, or
because there are more opportunities in 'building products and fire and
safety'? Moreover, why does Rudd say the businesses he is selling 'are
better owned by other people'? It is the answers to these question that will
help us understand whether or not Rudd is doing the right thing.
We need to know what William's parenting skills are and why Rudd believes he
will have an advantage in building products rather than in engineering or
electronics.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Local should mean local
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MANDELSON MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My observation of local government re-organisation in Cleveland leads
me to believe you are wrong in arguing for two-tier strategic and service
authorities ('Local difficulties', December 22).
The evidence suggests that by moving to unitary authorities substantial
administrative savings can be made, producing a lower tax burden for
individuals and businesses. Most services will benefit from being provided
by a single authority. The overlap between authorities leading to public
confusion and duplication of bureaucracy can be removed. The question is,
should the move to single-tier authorities be upwards to the 'strategic'
level, or downwards to the public.
You argue, unconvincingly, for both. Surely the most desirable level of
local government corresponds to its principal role - provision of practical
and personal services to the local population and to groups in particular
need in the community. You can argue about economies of scale, pointing to
the creation of large, mega-authorities such as the Teesside-wide authority
being advocated by some to replace Cleveland County Council. But the logic
of 'local' services suggests that, as far as possible, they should be
delivered by councils which are elected by local people and remain as near,
accountable and sensitive to the needs of those people.
What, then, should be the 'strategic' dimension at local government? I think
it is wrong to argue, as you do, that this can be genuinely accommodated by
a council the size of a county or slightly larger. Cleveland County Council,
for example, adds little in any economic or other planning sense to what the
district councils are doing among themselves already or what they could
achieve through shared arrangements with much less rigmarole than at
present.
A truly strategic dimension might then be reflected in a regional level of
government but still with local services provided by unitary authorities
which mirror local communities and public preferences. Where possible, that
is the downwards direction in which reorganisation should go.

Sir, Bah and humbug Mr Harris] Clay Harris's debunking of Leeds Development
Corporation's Christmas card in his entertaining article ('The folly and the
lively', December 23) on corporate greetings cards missed the point.
'We'll give you something to toast this Christmas' is, indeed, the promise,
followed by 'Great deals on land in Leeds. Prime sites at realistic prices.'
In the climate of the Pounds 50bn budget deficit, the Financial Times of all
newspapers should surely be applauding a development corporation that is not
missing any opportunity to entice money into the public coffers.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Chops off the old block lose appeal: Meat producers' efforts
to combat vegetarianism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sarah Young, a 17-year old vegetarian at Coombe Girls School in New Malden,
Surrey, cooked her own Christmas lunch this year while the rest of her
family tucked into roast turkey. 'I used to love eating meat, but the more I
found out about the way animals are killed and kept, the more I went off it.
Now I can't stand the sight of it,' she says.
Ms Young is one of six pupils in a class of 25 at Coombe Girls who have
given up eating meat. Most have changed their diets because they disapprove
of the killing of animals and of factory farming methods.
Surveys suggest the sixth-formers fit the bill for the typical vegetarian -
a young, middle-class female living in the south of England. While about 4
per cent of adults are vegetarians - double the figure 10 years ago - the
proportion of non-meat eaters among younger age groups is much higher. A
report by the Henley Centre for Forecasting, a market research consultancy,
for the Asda supermarket group this year found that 11 per cent of girls
aged 13 to 15 were vegetarian. Similarly, a Gallup survey for Realeat, a
vegetarian food manufacturer, showed that 13 per cent of 16-24-year-old
females were vegetarian.
Mr Glynne Steele, youth campaigner for the Vegetarian Society, says he
receives 50 to 100 letters a day from under-18 year-olds seeking more
information about vegetarianism and nutritional advice.
The corollary of the drop in meat eating among the young has been a big
increase in the market for vegetarian foods. Mintel International, the
market research group, says sales of vegetarian foods, including fruit and
vegetables as well as specialist items, exceeded Pounds 11bn in 1992,
compared with Pounds 8.8bn in 1988. Sales of 'meat alternatives' - for
instance soya products and Quorn, made from a mushroom-like substance -
reached Pounds 25.5m last year from Pounds 6.6m in 1988.
In spite of the growing popularity of vegetarianism, the Meat and Livestock
Commission, responsible for promoting Britain's meat, takes a surprisingly
relaxed view. It is dismissive of the number of teenage girls giving up
meat, saying they are doing so as a 'protest'.
The commission's statistics show total meat consumption has remained steady,
or even risen slightly: 65.4kg per person per year in 1990 against 64.2kg in
1970. 'I bet a lot of retailers would be delighted to have a product that
penetrates into 97 per cent of households,' said Mr Ambrose Landon,
commission press and industry relations manager.
But the overall figures for meat consumption disguise a shift away from red
meat towards poultry, and a move by consumers towards eating meat as a treat
in restaurants rather than as a mainstay at home. Both trends threaten the
traditional markets of many meat producers. At the same time, Mr Landon
accepts meat producers are having to adapt to a changing market place, where
convenience is the priority.
Government food surveys highlight the growing popularity of meat products
such as sausages and minced meat over traditional cuts. Consumption of
carcass meat - roasting joints, chops and other cuts close to the bone - has
declined in recent years, from 11oz per person each week in 1991 to about
10oz last year. But consumption of other meat and meat products rose to
23.5oz from 22.7oz.
'When people say they are cutting down on meat, they probably mean joints
and traditional cuts of meat. Many do not class their sausages or spaghetti
Bolognese as meat,' says Mr Landon.
The Vegetarian Society addresses the commission's arguments by saying many
people are rejecting factory farming methods and turning to free-range and
organically-raised meat. Consumption of the latter increased from Pounds 1m
to Pounds 9m between 1988 and 1992, according to Mintel. 'These are at least
steps in the right direction,' says Mr Steele.
He believes the spread of information about how farm animals are reared and
slaughtered is turning more people vegetarian: 'A hundred animals are killed
every second of the working day in this country. Most are being kept in
abhorrent conditions and being killed in a terrible way.'
Attitudes are formed early. Adam McNamara, aged 10, gave up eating meat a
year ago after seeing a news report about conditions in slaughterhouses. 'If
a few more people became vegetarians, perhaps farmers would start being a
bit kinder to animals,' he says.
At Coombe Girls, sixth-former Clare Langen says she gave up eating meat
after she saw her uncle, a farmer, kill a chicken. 'I saw him wring its neck
and I can't look at meat without thinking about it.'
The play on emotions by vegetarian campaigners angers meat producers, who
believe the standard of animal welfare in the UK is second to none. 'Many
farmers would like to see all vegetarians hung, drawn and quartered,' says a
National Farmers' Union official wryly.
So far, however, the counter-offensive by meat producers against the
vegetarian lobby has focused on trying to win the debate over the health
aspects of eating red meat. A Gallup poll this year found that 6.5 per cent
of adults avoid red meat, against 1.9 per cent a decade ago, while 40 per
cent say they are eating less meat. 'You've got to separate the myth from
the facts of vegetarianism. These young people have got to be told the facts
about meat, its nutritional value and how good it is for you,' says Mr
Martin Burtt, a Yorkshire beef farmer. There is a sense of defensiveness:
'To tell you the truth, the few vegetarians I've seen are not exactly
healthy-looking specimens,' he says.
Dr Michael Nelson, lecturer in nutrition at King's College, London, a
vegetarian, agrees there are some health benefits to eating meat - but not
many. 'There are probably some advantages in terms of iron intake and
vitamin B12, but I wouldn't recommend eating it every day.'
He says there can be as much as seven times the amount of saturated fat  -
which can increase the risk of heart disease - as polyunsaturated fat in
some meat, whereas vegetable oils contain up to twice as much
polyunsaturated as saturated fat.
In an attempt to prevent the debate tilting further in favour of
vegetarians, the Meat and Livestock commission launched its Pounds 1.5m
'Meat to Live' advertising campaign two years ago. This was targeted at
young women in the 20 to 35 age group who were considering reducing their
meat intake or that of their partners.
The glossy adverts featured fit, good-looking men, frolicking in the surf or
playing sports, and stressed the health benefits of eating meat. The
Vegetarian Society labelled the adverts typical of the 'sexist' approach of
the commission. 'It's saying: Well, women. If you want men to look like
that, you've got to feed them meat,' said Mr Steele.
The commission, however, claimed the campaign was a success, at least in
beginning to arrest the numbers of young women cutting down on meat eating.
After a year, the commission surveyed women in the target age range and
found that the number who said they were eating less meat had fallen from 15
to 14 per cent. The number of women who planned to cut meat consumption in
future had dropped from 7 to 5 per cent.
The commission plans a television, magazine and poster campaign in spring,
costing more than Pounds 7m, to persuade meat eaters to keep up the habit.
'Its objective will be to show that meat is a modern, versatile food,' says
Mr David Lewis, the commission's communications manager.
Stopping the growth of vegetarianism among young people - and countering
fears about animal welfare - will be a much harder task. Most pupils at
Coombe Girls, even the meat eaters, felt they could not pass a butcher's
shop without averting their eyes.

<TEXT>
Sir, Contrary to the assertions contained in your report on the TUC
('Specialist unions warned over merger danger', December 23), I welcomed
warmly the TUC general secretary's radical proposals for reforming some of
the TUC's structures. I made no comment about the composition and powers of
the proposed new executive committee.
I did question the very limited time available for consultation within
constituent unions. Further, I said all unions, including Unison, would want
to be assured there were adequate processes, when required to consider their
members' interests. This means, for example, facilities for the TUC to bring
together unions representing members in local government and the National
Health Service.
I am not a dinosaur, I am a wholehearted advocate of radical change. Were
that not the case, I would still be general secretary of Nalgo.

<TEXT>
Sir, I have just read your most interesting article about the advertising of
toys, particularly on television ('Harnessing pester power', December 23).
I think the statement by Mr Peter Waterman, vice-president of corporate
affairs at Hasbro, that 'advertising to children is an entirely harmless
activity', is the most cynical I have read in a long time. All over Britain
parents are being made to feel guilty because they cannot spend huge sums or
are building up huge debts that will cripple their lives for months to come.
As a teacher and mother, I happen to think that this is extremely harmful.
Britain obviously lags behind other countries in controlling this insidious
exploitation.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Owls and moles: The best business books of the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

TAYLOR, ANDREW BOLGER and EDWARD BALLS

<TEXT>
One burning question for the first few months of 1994 will be how long the
current bull market in the New York and London equity markets can continue.
Stock market futurologists are two-a-penny, but small investors could well
take strategic advice from Peter Lynch, who transformed Fidelity's Magellan
mutual fund from a Dollars 18m weakling in 1977 into a Dollars 14bn giant
when he stepped down in 1990.
His second book on investment, Beating the Street (Simon &amp; Schuster) is full
of encouraging anecdotes about how the private investor can outperform the
professionals. It is liberally sprinkled with pungent one-liners such as:
'Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon,' or 'All else
being equal, invest in the company with the fewest colour photographs in the
annual report.'
Readers will start to believe they are capable of finding one of Lynch's
'tenbaggers' - stocks that rise tenfold and make up for the duds in the
portfolio.
The recent successful conclusion of a world trade agreement removed one
potential threat to market rallies. But optimism that another lease of life
for Gatt ensures a new era of prosperity will be tempered by reading
Preparing For The Twenty-First Century (Harper Collins) by Paul Kennedy, a
professor of history at Yale. This fair-minded overview of economic trends,
threats to the environment, and growing demographic imbalances suggests
humanity faces challenges with which it is ill-equipped to cope. Kennedy
concedes that market forces and developments in areas such as bio-technology
might provide answers.
For a more immediate look at the challenges facing corporate strategists,
try Mass Customization by B Joseph Pine (Harvard Business School Press). The
book poses an increasingly common business conundrum: how to cater to ever
more individualistic customer demands while retaining the cost efficiencies
of traditional mass-production. Pine argues that companies can - and will be
obliged to - do both, but only if they radically restructure their
operations to make flexibility and the provision of tailor-made solutions a
way of life.
If Pine is visionary, John Kay's Foundations of Corporate Success (Oxford
University Press) is refreshingly iconoclastic. Taking the axe to
fashionable theories about corporate strategy, Kay likens many of the
nostrums peddled by business gurus to quack medicine.
He argues that trying to divine why some companies succeed is pointless,
because the reasons in each case are peculiar to the companies concerned.
Instead of looking for corporate role models to emulate, managers should
identify what 'distinctive capabilities' their company possesses and use
them to differentiate it from competitors. Whether or not you accept Kay's
theory, the book is thought-provoking and thoroughly documented.
However, he does not entirely avoid some of the pitfalls he criticises in
others - such as compiling lists of star companies. It is by no means
obvious that Glaxo, Guinness and LVMH, for instance, will shine as brightly
this decade as they did in the last.
Another 1980s success story currently in difficulty is Nintendo, the
Japanese video game manufacturer. David Sheff's book, How Nintendo Zapped an
American Industry, Captured Your Dollars, and Enslaved Your Children (Random
House), provides a well-researched and colourful insight into the rise of
the company through the late 1980s.
Nevertheless, Sheff, a California-based author, argues that Nintendo made a
serious mistake when it delayed releasing a more powerful and advanced video
games machine - a lapse which allowed Sega, its arch rival, to secure a
foothold in the market.
One role of business books such as Sheff's is to look beneath the gleam of
the brightest shiners. Take Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, which carefully
cultivates the image of enlightened employer and housewife's friend. In
reality, according to Alecia Swasy, a Wall Street Journal reporter who used
to cover P&amp;G, it is a paranoid, sinister institution, obsessed by secrecy
and control, which spies on its employees and bullies those who stand in its
way.
P&amp;G's notorious secrecy makes it an excellent subject for investigation and
Swasy's book, Soap Opera. The Inside Story of Procter &amp; Gamble (Times
Books), the product of interviews with more than 300 current and former P&amp;G
employees, provides important insights into the company's ugly side. She
argues that the abrasive management style of chairman Ed Artzt, widely known
as the Prince of Darkness, is undermining company morale and prompting a
troubling brain drain among senior executives.
How unfortunate, then, that this determined digging is marred by such a
one-sided tone, by generalities and argumentative non sequiturs, that the
book undermines much of its own credibility.
For writers, as well as companies, manipulating the public's view of the
past, present and future may be the key to success: 'The only way to build
the future is to build it on lies,' was the maxim of Armand Hammer, the
founder of Occidental Petroleum, who died in 1990 at the age of 92.
According to Carl Blumay's chronicle, The Dark Side of Power: the real
Armand Hammer (Simon Schuster), Hammer rarely departed from that principle.
Blumay should know. He ran Occidental's public relations operations for 25
years, building the public image that Hammer was a business genius and a
philanthropist with influence in the Kremlin and the White House. The
reality, Blumay says, was a backstage drama of bribes, manipulation,
financial losses, a gun-toting delinquent son and a collection of
high-cheekboned mistresses on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
Blumay's highly entertaining book says little of his own reasons for helping
Hammer mislead the outside world, and his sources are few and hard to
corroborate. The question is whether his account can be believed - there is
still room for a definitive book telling the whole truth about Armand
Hammer. Perhaps next year.

Sir, I do not think that your headline, 'Forerunner of European central bank
is left homeless' (December 29) is true. It would have been left homeless if
it had a home and then left it, for whatever reason, with nowhere to go.
I suspect there is a little wry amusement at the bank's initial difficulties
in that headline. But we have lost this one for good and it would be best to
learn to live with it.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Arts: Feelgood movies give way to darker themes - As easy
targets such as right and left-wing tyrannies collapse, British cinema has
found a new villain / Political correctness - Cinema in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Many a job has its own occupational dangers, many of them readily insurable.
They can range from errant factory machinery to collapsible coalfaces, from
tennis elbow to housemaid's knee to athlete's foot.
Film critics, though, are a disadvantaged group. Once or twice a year they
are set upon, violently and uninsurably, by friends or colleagues who cry
'Why did you send me to such-and-such a film?' or 'I took my entire family
to see Bloodbath At The Abattoir on the strength of your review' or 'About
that small, subtitled Armenian film, Nigel, that you recommended at the ICA
. . .'
There is no insurance against people who go ape after taking your advice.
All one can point out helpfully and unapologetically - I do so now in
response to those FT colleagues who have recently fulminated at me about The
Piano - is that film reviewing is not an Exact Science. A critic can be
secure in his own opinion; he can shore it up with arguments and even cite
the international prizes a film has won. But still people will bear down
with murder in their eyes, asking why they were sent to a film with a
heroine who does not speak, a back-end-of-nowhere setting (turn-of-century
New Zealand bush) and a whole lot of rampant sex and violence.
We will return to The Piano shortly, round about Ten Best time. But this was
a year, to console the aggrieved, in which many films had a built-in
Feelgood Factor. Among them: Much Ado About Nothing, The Wedding Banquet,
Sleepless In Seattle and even that feminism-made-easy British costume
extravaganza, Orlando.
Feelgood Movies are not to be sniffed at - or rather, if they are good, they
are to be sniffed at. The finest FMs are Kleenex-intensive charmers which
push the viewer through a forest of readily recognisable emotional problems
(love, birth, bereavement) before reaching the clearing of the Happy Ending.
Feelgood films, as the above list shows, need not be empty-headed. They can
be essays in sharp-eyed sentiment, in mirth-as-therapy and in multiple
resolution, as secure in their own genre tradition as Shakespearean comedy.
Comedy - broad comedy - was something we wanted more of in 1993. But it was
not the year's mood. The highlights were Robin Williams running amok as the
voice of Aladdin's genie, Bill Murray refuting the truth that 'tomorrow is
another day' in the time-warp comedy Groundhog Day, Billy Crystal as a
stand-up comic breaking them up in the Borscht Belt in the underpraised Mr
Saturday Night, and - well, that was about it. Next year already looks
stronger, with Woody Allen's best comedy in years coming in January,
Manhattan Murder Mystery, and Wayne's World 2 arriving to rescue WW1
withdrawal-symptom sufferers.
But in 1993 darker waters from deeper wellsprings kept gurgling to the
surface. The year began with horror and serial killing: from a
bloodier-than-usual Dracula to rabies-inducing modern fables like Reservoir
Dogs and Man Bites Dog. And later, our overworked censor was tested by three
British films high on sexual anarchy and political or moral incorrectness:
Mike Leigh's Naked (rape, misogyny), Peter Greenaway's The Baby Of Macon
(multiple rape, multiple misogyny, plus murder and mutilation) and Andrew
Birkin's The Cement Garden (masturbation in glorious colour).
What ever is British cinema up to? Responding, I suspect, as much world
cinema is today, to an age in which new complex despotisms are replacing the
old simple ones. Easy targets like right-wing tyranny (South Africa) and
left-wing tyranny (Soviet Union) are collapsing all around us, so where does
freedom of thought and action look for a threat to itself?
To the new villain: liberal-humanist dogma, aka political correctness. All
three UK movies come to the rescue of a world they see being hijacked by the
gung-ho puritanism of the PC crowd, and/or by the refusal of today's trendy
opinion-makers to incorporate Real Human Nature into their calculations
about Proper Human Behaviour.
The attack on political correctness is a good cause. But of course good
causes do not always make good movies. Of these three British films one was
an overblown dirge (Greenaway's), one an underblown mess (Leigh's) and only
the third (Birkin's), strengthened by the vertebra of an Ian McEwan story,
had a wit and insight to go with its gleeful iconoclastic impulse.
Ironically, just to prove that There Are No Rules, the year's best British
feature had more than a touch of the PCs itself: Ken Loach's Raining Stones,
a tale of salt-of-the-earth Northerners battling for survival with honour in
post-Thatcher England. But oddball humanity ended up beating down
prescriptive humanism.
Ironically, too, the British year ended, at once consolingly and chillingly,
with the perfect elegance of a James Ivory film, The Remains Of The Day. No
political controversy here, except about 60-year-old pre-war appeasement
matters. And the film brought with it the assurance that when all else fails
in British movies - and it often will - Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson
will always be there to bale us out. Oscars, luvvies?
Two low-budget British films which will not feature in any Oscars ceremony,
and which also climbed clear of the PC debate - were Derek Jarman's
Wittgenstein and Blue. The first was the year's most playful bio-pic, the
second a miracle of mind over lack-of-matter. What can you do, Jarman seemed
to ask, with nothing but a few noises on a soundtrack and 76 minutes of
solid-blue screen? Answer (if you are Jarman): everything.
A quick sweep around the rest of the world must suffice as an antidote to UK
parochialism. The best continental European film was Krzystof Kieslowski's
Three Colours Blue: a character study of bereavement as intense as a
surgical probe. The best low-budget Central American movie was Robert
Rodriguez's El Mariachi from Mexico: a monstrously inventive and funny
mock-Western. Best Canadian film: Guy Maddin's Alpine-Gothic pastoral
pastiche, Careful. Best Far-Eastern films: Zhang Yimou's The Story Of Qiu Ju
and Ang Lee's The Wedding Banquet, two delicately finger-painted films from
countries more used to the florid action gesture. Best southern hemisphere
movie: yes, you knew we would get back to it - The Piano.
Casual nudity, not-so-casual violence and a ringingly horrible amputation
scene. No wonder my work colleagues give me funny looks. These are all
things that do not happen in Victorian costume films: except that they do
now, after Jane Campion's. If this cinema round-up has been obsessed with
one film more than any other, it is because The Piano is the movie of 1993
that points most fiercely, most convincingly towards the year 2000.
It is a 'feminist' film that flies beyond arid rhetoric into pulsing
romanticism. It is a costume film that dares to see what lies beneath the
costumes. It is a movie that takes the 'international' casting of the modern
musical-chairs movie world - Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel as Victorian
Scots in New Zealand? - and makes it work triumphantly.
Above all, The Piano dissolves all the old outworn enmities between 'art
cinema' and 'entertainment cinema'. It marries a passionately compelling
story to a symbolist landscape and psychological vision as detailed and
richly-worked as anything in Bergman. You say you did not like it? Then see
it again.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Arts: Hard times can also be healthy times / A look at the
changing face of Europe's musical establishment during 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three developments dominated the musical landscape of continental Europe
over the past year, each with broad implications for the future. The
appointment of Hugues Gall as head of the Paris Opera raised hopes that this
once-great institution may enjoy a rebirth. After nearly half a century of
boom, Germany's orchestras and opera companies found themselves hard hit by
recession. And in Salzburg, Gerard Mortier continued to upset everyone and
anyone, provoking a public spat with Claudio Abbado over links between the
Easter and Summer festivals, and then telling the Vienna Philharmonic that
it may be dispensable.
Gall will not assume hands-on control of the Opera Bastille until 1995, but
his appointment - in the wake of the French centre-right parties' return to
power last March - has already injected a long-overdue note of realism. The
Bastille was a Socialist utopia, designed to give the highest number of
performances to the largest number of people in the best possible quality.
It has been a lame duck since its inauguration in 1989, plagued by technical
faults, rocketing budgets, poor artistic planning, bad management and
strikes - the latest of which, in November, forced the cancellation of the
opening night of Bob Wilson's Madama Butterfly.
Gall proposes strong medicine. The number of performances at the Bastille
will be reduced, but will include the grand classical ballets which can sell
out its 2700-seat auditorium. A select slab of the opera repertory will
return to the Palais Garnier (probably at higher prices than the Bastille),
alongside a reduced ballet schedule. Both houses will at some point be shut,
the Bastille for acoustical improvements, the Garnier for refurbishment.
The biggest challenge will be political. To bring down costs, staff must be
reduced, monopolies broken, contracts renegotiated. Gall will be treading a
tightrope with the unions and the Opera orchestra, who have sabotaged all
previous attempts at reform. He will try to 'cohabit' with the current music
director, Myung-Whun Chung, who stands to lose most of his power. With
Pierre Berge's motley management team now clearing their desks, the Bastille
can be expected to drift for the next 18 months. Gall, who was Rolf
Liebermann's deputy at the Opera in the 1970s, knows the problems inside
out. His record over the past 12 years in Geneva suggests he has the
political and artistic savoir-faire for the job. But he will be climbing an
operatic Everest.
Musical Germany fell into a state of shock as recession took its toll. From
Bielefeld to Bamberg, budgets were chopped by up to 20 per cent. Even the
Bayreuth Festival has been forced to trim expenditure. While the long-term
effect on morale and artistic vitality is far from clear, some conclusions
can be drawn. Germany has not made the mistake of subjecting its myriad
orchestras and theatres to a beauty contest; none will disappear. With few
exceptions (notably the Berlin Philharmonic), cuts have been applied equally
and received stoically.
But there has been a change in perception. High cultural spending has long
been taken for granted in Germany. There was unnecessary fat and a lot of
waste. One of the most perceptive remarks came from Christoph von Dohnanyi,
a former intendant in Frankfurt and Hamburg and now chief conductor of the
Cleveland Orchestra: 'Hard times can also be healthy times. Theatres must
make themselves necessary to the society which pays for them. Art without
some financial pressure is not good - as long as the pressure is not so
great that it actually hinders art.'
Three years after his arrival in Salzburg, Gerard Mortier continues to
ruffle feathers. His joust with Abbado over co-production plans for the 1995
Easter and Summer festivals may have ended inconclusively, but it showed
that Abbado was not to be out-manoeuvred. By forcing the Italian conductor
to fight on behalf of the Easter Festival, Mortier has unwittingly helped to
make it more independent of the summer event. Competition will be healthy.
Abbado has yet to indicate how far he plans to remould and liven up the
Easter Festival, but his record in Berlin suggests that no-one is better
able to change perceptions.
Mortier's conflict with the Vienna Philharmonic, which boiled over again in
early December, is more far-reaching. The orchestra has been resident at the
Summer Festival for 70 years; it even has a street in Salzburg named after
it. The musicians' threat to boycott the festival after 1995 has to be taken
seriously. Mortier considers the Philharmonic conservative and expensive,
and is not afraid to say so in public. He awarded last summer's opening
concert to a youth orchestra; the highlight of the 1994 concert programme
promises to be a Beethoven cycle featuring the Chamber Orchestra of Europe.
Mortier reckons the Salzburg Festival can survive without the Vienna
Philharmonic - but can Mortier survive his own non-stop offensive on the
festival's sacred cows? His programme has been a breath of fresh air.
Salzburg needed that - but it may not tolerate Mortier's big mouth
indefinitely.
Outside the festival season, Berlin clearly eclipsed Vienna as Europe's
musical capital, notwithstanding another excellent Wien Modern contemporary
music festival in November. Abbado has rejuvenated the Berlin Philharmonic;
Daniel Barenboim has transformed the Staatsoper unter den Linden. The fusion
of artistic life between east and west Berlin has been slow but not as
painful as anticipated. After watching the Schiller Theater go down as a
sacrificial lamb, most companies survived. Fears that the Deutsche Oper
might not last the decade now look unfounded.
In Munich, the Jonas touch has yet to be properly felt at the Bavarian State
Opera, despite a clever public relations campaign since the former ENO
general director arrived in September. His real test will be the July opera
festival: can he make it a truly festive event, or will it remain an
expensive run-through of repertory? Whatever tricks he pulls out of the bag,
Jonas surely realises he needs a more dynamic music director than Peter
Schneider.
Looking back over my own tally of performances, I find the following
reputations either enhanced or consolidated: Samuel Ramey, whose first Boris
Godunov (in Geneva) was imposing without excess histrionics; Nikolaus
Lehnhoff, whose poetic production of Henze's Der Prinz von Homburg - revived
at Zurich in the autumn - has almost single-handedly rehabilitated this
beautiful work; Sylvain Cambreling, whose conducting of Simon Boccanegra was
a much-needed fillip for Frankfurt's musical life; the Oslo Philharmonic,
which made a triumphant tour of Europe's four major summer festivals with
Mariss Jansons; the Bolshoi Opera, whose concert performances at the Lucerne
Festival showed a tradition intact; Waltraud Meier, whose courageous Isolde
at Bayreuth and radiant Sieglinde in Berlin vindicated her move into
dramatic soprano territory; and Olaf Henzold, the most promising young
German conductor.
Declining reputations included Placido Domingo, whose Bayreuth Parsifal
suggested an artist on automatic pilot; Bob Wilson and Ruth Berghaus, who do
little more than repeat their own theatrical cliches from one production to
the next; and Yuri Temirkanov, who is starting to become a liability for the
St Petersburg Philharmonic.
My performance of the year was Gounod's Mireille in Lausanne at the end of
November, a blissfully natural production of an underrated opera. No stars,
no ugliness, no vulgarity, no need to be strikingly original or modern -
just pure lyric charm, provencal atmosphere and a powerful performance from
Danielle Borst in the title role.

One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl and four for a boy . . . why
do magpies command such superstition? It is not limited to England: in
Sweden magpies are connected with witchcraft and in Scotland if they fly
near your window it heralds a death. Magpie In The Dock is presented as a
courtroom drama with Geoffrey Palmer defending and Nicholas Rowe prosecuting
(BBC1, 8.00).
To male viewers over 45 the title Health And Efficiency means only one
thing: weird photographs of naked women which used to appear in the naturist
magazine of the 1950s and 60s. Arthur Marshall, author of If You See God
Tell Him, who has chosen the title for his new comedy series (8.30, BBC1)
must presumably know this, yet his series is set in a hospital.
Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, who enacted one of the greatest love
scenes in Don't Look Now, star again in BBC2's 'Screen Two' drama The
Railway Station Man. The script is by Shelagh Delaney from a novel by Ulster
writer Jennifer Johnston, about a woman who flees to Donnegal with her young
son after the killing of her husband (9.00).

FT  30 DEC 93 / Management: The quality gospel according to Deming - A man
revered for his influence on corporate competitiveness in the US and Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most influential figures in modern industrial management theory,
W. Edwards Deming, once remarked - with typical antagonistic bluntness -
that he would like to be remembered in his native US as 'someone who spent
his life trying to keep America from committing suicide'.
When he died in Washington, DC, last week at the age of 93, that wish was
amply fulfilled, as some of the largest companies in the US paid tribute to
his role in improving their competitiveness.
Ford, the country's most efficient car manufacturer, said Deming had been
instrumental in guiding it to a 'sharp focus on quality, not only in its
manufacturing processes, but in all of its operations'.
There is no small irony in this, for Deming, who first made his name in
Japan, where he was revered by industrialists for four decades, was largely
unknown in the US until the start of the 1980s. That was when a television
documentary on the US's diminishing industrial competitiveness described his
key role in formulating those quality control techniques which have played
such an important part in Japan's industrial achievements.
As the US stampeded after Japan, Mr Deming suddenly found himself in great
demand, along with a handful of other experts, as a consultant in a set of
business theories, pioneered by the Japanese, which have come to be known as
total quality management (TQM). Ford was one of Deming's earliest converts.
TQM, which is now being embraced by European companies, has become perhaps
the most influential management theory of the late 20th century. It has many
variants, but at its heart lies an unremitting focus on maximising quality
in every aspect of a company's work, involving all employees in the process
and trying to achieve the complete satisfaction of a customer's demands.
But there is a danger of over-emphasising the cantankerous Deming's
importance in all this. He has certainly been the most visible and
charismatic advocate of the quality movement, but he did not start it, and a
motley collection of cooks from around the globe have contributed to the TQM
soup.
Man has been tracking quality, in one form or another, for generations, but
the modern movement's origins are often traced to Walter Shewhart, an
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph executive. In the 1920s he devised a method
of using statistics to control the quality of telephones manufactured at the
company's Hawthorne Works in Chicago.
The plant's employees included Deming and Joseph Juran, who became disciples
of Shewhart's statistical methods and went on to be the two most influential
members of the quality movement. Juran, aged 89, is now on his last speaking
tour before retirement.
Both men had a profound impact on Japan as it tried to rebuild its shattered
industries after the second world war. Deming, the first to visit Japan, so
impressed its businessmen with the importance of statistical quality control
that in 1951 they created a Deming Prize for companies which had shown
impressive quality advances. It took 36 years for the US to do likewise,
with the Baldrige Award.
Juran, who first toured Japan in 1954, is widely credited with teaching the
country that statistical techniques needed to be backed up with a
complementary management commitment to quality in general. But in a recent
interview Juran maintained: 'If neither I nor Deming had gone to Japan in
the early 1950s, the Japanese would still have achieved world quality
leadership.'
Deming, for one, may have learnt almost as much from the Japanese as he
taught them: he only formulated his celebrated 14 Points - the crux of his
mature quality theory - in the 1970s, after two decades observing Japan's
unique management culture, which tries to involve all employees in making
decisions. The 14 points involve a much more philosophical approach to
quality than the practical advice handed out by most consultants. Deming
suggested that a successful company needed to undergo a revolution in
thinking.
The elements included 'constancy of purpose' - a knowledge of what business
it is in and a strategy for staying ahead; 'profound knowledge' of subjects
such as statistical theory and group dynamics; and a constant striving to
improve.
Arguing that bad management was generally responsible for 85 per cent of a
company's problems, he urged executives to 'drive out fear' and encourage
creativity among junior workers by giving them more responsibility and
treating them as colleagues. He deplored performance ratings and
inter-departmental competition as inimical to co-operation.
Juran, by contrast, places less emphasis on the importance of statistics and
suggests that the Juran Trilogy - quality planning, control and improvement
 -can be mastered without philosophical transformations. Other prominent US
experts, such as Phil Crosby, offer still different approaches.
David Garvin, a Harvard Business School professor who has written
extensively on quality issues, says Deming's theory may be better for some
kinds of companies - it seems to have worked well in the mass production
vehicle industry - while Juran's tack may suit others, such as
engineering-driven technology businesses.
But he adds that 'anyone who tries to say Deming is more important than
Juran, than Crosby, misses the point. Each has staked out important pieces
of the terrain'. Only when you put them all together, he says, do you come
up with the very demanding quality criteria laid down for the Baldrige award
 -and they are in themselves no guarantee of success. 'Anyone who tells you
quality is the answer to all of your competitive problems is being very
misleading,' says Garvin. 'There's no simple solution.'
Deming would have thoroughly agreed with that hard-nosed judgment - despite
his elevation late in life to the pantheon of management gurus.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Management: Facing the future of choice - John Neill
continues our series by advancing a model for forging closer ties with
customers and suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN NEILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forecasting a decade forward was tough enough ten years ago, when the world
was changing more slowly than it is now.
The hazards of doing so can be demonstrated by recalling the management
theories which were fashionable then but are rejected today. Mass production
ideas, for example, have been replaced with lean thinking concepts.
Forward-looking organisations are no longer driven by the 1980s mantras of
financial engineering and earnings per share growth.
It is worth remembering, too, that while the great academic thinkers advance
our knowledge with new management ideas, some of their 'Eurekas' imply old
messages masquerading in new language.
In trying to crystallise my own thinking, I have started with the basic
assumption that the company of tomorrow will have to delight customers faced
with a bewildering array of choice. At the same time, they will have to
survive in their chosen markets, all of which will be subject to virulent
global competition.
Work can now be done almost anywhere by almost anyone, heralding new waves
of competitive intensity, unparalleled in the experience of many of today's
leading companies. Three billion people have entered the global market
economy since the demise of communism.
Since I contend that our system of democracy and the market economy is in
harmony with the human spirit, I expect to see these new market entrants
aspire to our lifestyle. In many countries, employment costs are between one
tenth and one hundredth of those in Europe and they are now producing high
quality products with high technology and high productivity.
How will we respond to this new tidal wave of competition? Our conventional
way of working - which I would describe as Model A - equips us poorly. It is
characterised by short-term, power-based relationships between the company
and its stakeholders. Many companies adopt this approach, convinced that it
is a superior way of securing competitive advantage.
The company's ownership structure is a powerful determinant of its
behaviour. Under Model A, the City can and will abandon publicly-quoted
companies at the speed of light when they fail to meet the expectations
which have been set for them or even if they exceed those expectations (in
the belief that their performance is unsustainable). The City itself
acknowledges the short-term nature of its approach. Companies striving to
meet unrealistic expectations reinforce Model A behaviour in dealing with
all their other stakeholders.
It should be noted that many of the go-go companies of the 1980s have become
the gone companies of the 1990s. During the years between 1986 and 1993,
earnings in corporate UK grew by 30 per cent but dividends by more than l00
per cent. This does not lead to world class companies. Study after study
demonstrates the vast gap in performance between UK companies and their
world class competitors.
Look also at the way in which some companies and their employees act. The
annual knock down fight between employers and trade unions is fatally flawed
because the latter too often demand shorter working weeks and more money
without the productivity gains to pay for it. The reality is that the unions
often win their short-term, power-based struggle but are then the first to
blame the management, the company or the government when massive job losses
follow some years later.
There is strong evidence that more than 60 per cent of western manufacturing
activity is non-value added. This waste cannot be eliminated in a model
characterised by short-term, power-based relationships.
Confrontation also dominates many company supplier relationships. The focus
is on the piece price with the purchasing department taking a tough line and
deliberately re-sourcing from time to time to demonstrate their prowess.
In the motor industry the contrast with the Japanese - whose companies
operate a 'shared destiny' relationship with their suppliers and lead the
world in quality and productivity - is telling.
There is, in my view, a superior model for long-term competitive advantage
which will characterise tomorrow's companies. I will describe it as Model B.
In this model, management will utilise and subscribe to the most appropriate
philosophies to inspire all their stakeholders to engage in long-term
relationships. This will be born out of the conviction that doing so offers
a superior way of securing competitive advantage.
This Model B company will strive to build lifetime relationships with its
customers and realise that to do so, it will need to harness the
intellectual energies and creativity of all its other stakeholders.
Model B companies will strive to create a community of employee stakeholders
who are committed to the company, the customer, quality and continuous
improvement.
The company of the future will view its suppliers as stakeholders and work
with them in close partnership, continuously striving to make its activities
from raw material to the end user, as lean and efficient as possible.
This company will realise that the vitality of the communities in which it
trades and from where it recruits future employees is crucial to its
prosperity and will lead or participate in partnership with others in its
community for mutual long-term benefit. This is not altruism or a return to
the soggy, failed collectivist ideologies of socialism and communism. I am
convinced it is the next step in the development of our capitalist system.
In Unipart we are trying hard to transform ourselves into a Model B company.
We know we have an enormous amount to do but to help us, we have established
our own Unipart 'U' (University). Its mission is to inspire people to
achieve world class levels of performance. We know we must change our
ability to reskill our stakeholders if we are to stand any chance of
arriving in the next century successfully.

FT  30 DEC 93 / SIB delays rules for disclosing commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Invest-ments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has put on
hold plans to require sales agents to disclose commission on term-assurance
policies.
The SIB board has decided to leave the question for the new Personal
Investment Authority, the proposed super-regulator for personal financial
services which is due to start operating around the middle of next year.
But SIB did agree draft proposals to be submitted to the Treasury on how all
sales agents - independent advisers, authorised representatives and those
based at banks and building societies - should disclose to prospective
customers the commission on sales of life products.
Its decision on term assurance represents a slight setback in the overall
moves towards disclosure of commission in the selling of financial services,
and followed opposition from the industry.
As commissions for selling term-assurance policies are lower than those for
life insurance, disclosure was thought to be less controversial.
But because term assurance is taken out for protection rather than for
investment, and because policyholders surviving beyond the period of their
policies receive no payment, it falls outside the terms of SIB's remit from
the Treasury. To draw up rules on commission disclosure in this area, SIB
would require the co-operation of the industry.
The rules are expected to seek to ensure that those selling and providing
life products along with other financial services, such as selling an
endowment policy with a mortgage, are not able to evade the rules by
switching commission to the 'non-life' product.
SIB confirmed that the proposals were 'on ice', but made clear they were
expected to be adopted by the PIA.
The move will, however, delay their implementation. By the time the rules
have been completed, the requirement to disclose commission on life
insurance is not expected to be in effect much before the end of the year.

FT  30 DEC 93 / TUC predicts large cuts in investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress yesterday predicted large cuts in investment as a
result of government spending plans for the next three years.
It said that by 1996-97 public capital would be 25 per cent below its level
at the start of the recession, which it said was in 1989-90. Transport
spending would fall 22 per cent in real terms between the current financial
year and 1996-97, housing investment would fall 12 per cent and training and
unemployment support 11 per cent.
The TUC said the jobless and poor would be hardest hit by reductions in
benefits. Mr John Monks, general secretary, said: 'It is becoming ever more
clear that the government is targeting the most vulnerable in society.
'Instead of attacking the unemployed and the public sector, they should be
using all available resources to strengthen the economy.'

FT  30 DEC 93 / IoD urges union reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions should lose their legal protection and turn themselves into voluntary
bodies servicing the legal rights of individual workers, the Institute of
Directors said yesterday.
The IoD, which is preparing its evidence to the Commons employment committee
on the future of unions, believes ending all legal immunities would conclude
the strategy begun by the government 13 years ago.
The institute will tell the government that action is needed to ensure that
industrial relations remain good during the recovery and that there is no
return to excessive wage demands by public-sector unions.
The IoD's main aim is to convince the government that it should legislate
further over unions. It points out that additional legislation will be
needed by 1996 to insert European Union directives into UK labour law.
The IoD's proposals include:
The introduction of a comprehensive system of legal rights for individuals
governing contracts of employment. The IoD believes unions will be obsolete
as collective bargainers and it sees no reason why workers organised in
groups should have special privileges.
The removal of any right to strike and the abolition of legal immunities for
workers in essential services. It favours the introduction of a statutory
duty for such workers to maintain services with compensation paid if the
legal obligation is not fulfilled. This would cover workers in the health
service, gas, water, electricity, telephone operating, ambulance and fire
services.
The end of centralised pay bargaining in the public sector with the
abolition of the remaining public-sector pay review bodies and further use
of performance-related individual pay.
Restriction of picketing to only six strikers at an entrance to their
workplace, and the introduction of a statutory picketing code to replace the
present voluntary system. It proposes that all mass picketing be made
unlawful. The removal of the legal obligation on companies to give unions
information for collective bargaining purposes.
Measures to encourage companies to introduce employee share ownership and
profit-related pay schemes.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Banks hit by Pounds 2.5m credit card fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 2.5m fraud controlled from the west Midlands and involving bogus
credit cards has been uncovered, police disclosed yesterday.
TSB and Midland Bank were among several financial organisations thought to
have suffered losses. Both declined to comment.
The bogus cards were used in France, Belgium and the Netherlands and in
parts of England and Wales.
Police said Fraud Squad officers were expected to make a number of arrests
during the next few days, and added: 'The fraud is a complicated one and has
involved a number of police officers in detection work for some time.'

FT  30 DEC 93 / Steel stockholder boost is forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steel stockholders, which buy steel in bulk from mills and prepare it for
sale to end users, will see their market grow modestly until 1996 because of
the expected upturn in the UK economy, says Marketing Strategies for
Industry, the market-research company.
The growth will reflect greater demand for steel from industries such as
automotive, construction, chemical process plant and gas supply, Marketing
Strategies says in a report.
It forecasts negligible market growth in 1997 as the economy slows, and
predicts a decline of 2 per cent in 1998.
The report estimates that UK mills' deliveries of steel to stockholders rose
3 per cent to 2.9m tonnes this year, reversing the downward trend which
reduced the size of the stockholders' market by 17 per cent between 1990 and
1992.
Strip mill products are believed to have increased their share of
stockholders' sales this year, accounting for 49 per cent of the market,
according to the report. Stainless steel also increased in importance.
In spite of the large number of stockholders, five companies together
accounted for almost half of UK sales this year. The largest, British Steel
Distribution, had a market share of about 32 per cent, said MSI.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Soldier wounded in bomb blast in centre of Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A soldier was wounded in the hand in a bomb attack near the centre of
Belfast last night. Police said a device was fired from the front garden of
a house at passing police and army vehicles. They said the injured soldier
was not badly hurt. Earlier a device had exploded in the centre of the city
as police officers were passing in a car. Nobody was hurt in that incident.
There have been five terrorist attacks in the province since the IRA
Christmas ceasefire ended on Sunday. They are seen as part of an IRA policy
of inflicting minimal damage while a formal response to the Anglo-Irish
peace declaration was being debated within the republican movement.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Republicans demand more concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Republican opinion in Northern Ireland appears to be hardening against the
London-Dublin peace declaration, after a meeting of more than 300 activists
suggested that there was no support for the declaration in its current form.
The meeting, involving members of Sinn Fein and the IRA and other
republicans from across the province, in Loughmacrory, County Tyrone late on
Tuesday, provided the first public demonstration of attitudes among IRA and
Sinn Fein supporters towards the declaration, issued two weeks ago by Mr
John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds.
At the meeting, attended by some of the 60 IRA prisoners on Christmas
parole, speakers insisted that they wanted peace discussions, but that
further explanations and concessions were needed from the UK government
before the declaration could be endorsed. None of the speakers accepted the
declaration in its current form.
They indicated an amnesty for prisoners they regard as political prisoners
was essential for any agreement, though Mr Brendan McFarlane, an IRA
prisoner on parole, in-sisted the prisoners could not be used as a
bargaining chip.
Mr Richard McAuley, a Sinn Fein official, denied that the party had made a
decision on the declaration, although he said that 'on one level' the
meeting reflected the mood of the republican community.
'There is a sense of disappointment now that people have had a chance to
look at the document and listen to what has been said by British ministers,'
he said.
Sinn Fein claims that a process of consultation is continuing with its
members. But the main reason for the delayed response appears to be
tactical, with republicans hoping to extract further concessions from
London.
The Tyrone meeting is likely to increase pressure on Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn
Fein president, to toughen his stance.
The IRA's tactics were further underlined in its new year message to its
followers in the Republican News newspaper. In the message, the IRA insists
that it supports continuation of the broader peace process, but gives no
indication of any readiness to abandon violence.

British Gas and Ofgas, the industry regulator, have agreed that 500m therms
of gas will be made available next year for release to British Gas's
competitors.
The amount is similar to that released in the first two years of the
programme, which was set up to stimulate competition in the supply of gas to
large industrial and commercial users. Since its inception the independent
gas marketing companies have captured about 70 per cent of the firm-contract
market.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Receivers urge move to fund job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Britain's leading insolvency specialists have called for the creation
of statutory company-funded schemes to finance redundancies when companies
run into difficulties, Richard Donkin writes.
Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, corporate recovery partners at
Arthur Andersen, say that this would allow troubled companies to reduce
their workforces when otherwise they might find themselves unable to fund
necessary redundancies.
The partners, who have handled some of the UK's biggest receiverships
including those at Leyland Daf and Ferranti, said they often found that
managements had wanted to cut workforces much earlier but had been unable to
find the money to do so.
The result is that receivers have found themselves bearing the brunt of
criticism by unions. In November both partners were censured by an
industrial tribunal for failing to meet their statutory obligations over
2,400 redundancies at the Leyland Daf truck plant in Lancashire. Employment
law requires managers to give workers 90 days' notice of their severance but
none had been issued by the company. The receivers said their priority had
been to keep the businesses alive, leaving no alternative but to issue
redundancies without the statutory notice.
The partners were left in the same position last month when they took over
the receivership of defence group Ferranti International and soon afterwards
announced 630 redundancies.
'As with Leyland, the company was stuck in this vicious spiral where it had
an excess headcount but could not afford to fund redundancies,' Mr Mc-Killop
said.
The partners propose that a scheme could be devised, possibly based on a
company pension scheme or an extension of one, that would cover redundancy
payments.
'In order to make sure that it is money that is not frozen it would have to
be linked into something such as pensions. The concept is that it would
include an obligation to an employee for back-service,' Mr McKillop said.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Researchers identify vital entrepreneurial qualities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers at Durham University claim to have identified seven factors
which indicate which entrepreneurs have the greatest potential for business
success.
The seven factors are:
Vision - the ability to project an image into the future of where the
individual would like their business to be.
Need for achievement - motivation to succeed and the ability to set
realistic goals and a structure to achieve them.
Need for autonomy, but also an ability to accept information and guidance
from others.
Calculated risk taking - the ability to evaluate risk and plan a strategy to
reduce it. Opportunistic tendency - the ability to perceive opportunities
for business development within the surrounding environment.
Internal locus of control - an acceptance of personal responsibility for the
business's performance rather than explaining success or failure by external
factors such as luck and chance.
Creativity and innovation.
The conclusions were gleaned by Durham University Business School from a
review of other research and tested on a sample of 16 graduate entrepreneurs
and 100 past and present Midlands small businesses.
Mr David Johnson, lecturer in entrepreneurship at the school, who directed
the research, said: 'It may be crashingly obvious, but people don't seem to
use the information.'
The challenge, he said, was not only to define the entrepreneurial behaviour
which can lead to business success but to devise a way of assessing
accurately in what measure people have it and whether it can be developed
through training.
The initial findings, to be published in early 1994, will be linked to
training workshops for users. The aim of the workshops is partly to prevent
the seven factors being used as a crude rejection tool.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Legal challenge to county council shake-up attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
District councils yesterday attacked the move by four county councils to
seek judicial review of the Local Government Commission's plans to
restructure them as a 'waste of time and taxpayers' money'.
The Labour-led Association of District Councils said that the counties were
'wasting public money on a lost cause'.
Ms Margaret Singh, who chairs the association, said: 'The commission's task
is difficult enough without the process being thrown into jeopardy by county
councils' delaying tactics, especially as they are squandering money which
could be put to better use.'
Cleveland and Somerset, which would both be abolished under the proposals,
and Derbyshire, which would lose control of the city of Derby and north-east
Derbyshire, have all announced plans to challenge the commission's plans in
court. All three claim that the commission has not carried out its work
correctly.
Lancashire, for which proposals have not yet been announced, is also seeking
a judicial review over the way the commission has interpreted its remit
following a change in its official guidance from ministers in September.
In Cleveland, where the county has estimated the cost of legal action at
about Pounds 150,000, Mr Bob Gibson, leader of Stockton borough council,
said he was satisfied that the commission's work had been carried out
fairly.
He described the legal move as a 'last desperate attempt at
self-preservation'.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Fowler scorns Labour 'atrophy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, yesterday sought to
rally Tory activists ahead of next year's local government and European
elections by launching a detailed attack on the Labour party and unveiling a
series of measures to help recruit more constituency agents.
In a new year letter to local party committees, Sir Norman indicated that
the Conservative leadership would try to focus the forthcoming election
campaigns on Labour's weakness in opposition rather than the Conservative
record in office.
He said Labour was suffering from 'intellectual atrophy' and had no new
ideas about social policy, the public services or public expenditure. He
described the agenda of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, as 'warmed-over
Wilsonism' consisting of corporatism, statism and 'old-fashioned jobs for
union boys'.
The party chairman was also confident that the government would have a
better standing by the time of the polls in May and June, in spite of a
recent set of poor opinion polls and strong sentiment at Westminster that
the Conservatives could face crushing defeats in the summer.
'The government's standing will rise as tough no-nonsense policies deliver
results,' Sir Norman said yesterday.
In a measure designed to boost morale among the Tory grassroots,
Conservative Central Office announced that it was setting aside Pounds 1m to
help recruit more constituency agents to help fight the next general
election.
In recent months Central Office staff have been concerned by the fall in the
number of local agents from about 300 at last year's general election to
about 230 now.
The new money, which will be disbursed from 1995, will supplement the
salaries which some agents receive from their local associations, and will
be focused on improving the party's presence in marginal constituencies. But
the measures will have little impact on next year's elections.
Sir Norman underlined yesterday that funds had become available because of
cost-cutting measures at Central Office in the past 18 months which have
halved its annual outgoings to Pounds 6m. Recent reforms have included
reductions in staff numbers and the appointment of a new board of
treasurers.
The Labour party said that it was confident that the moves outlined by Sir
Norman would make little difference at the polls.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Scott to investigate Royal Ordnance staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry is to investigate allegations that officials
from Royal Ordnance, the armaments company, helped a German small-arms
manufacturer evade embargoes on defence exports in the 1980s.
The prosecution in the trial in Germany of Mr Walter Lamp, managing director
of Heckler &amp; Koch, has alleged that officials in the UK company helped
divert arms to the former East German security services and the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels as well as to Iraq via the United Arab Emirates.
Heckler &amp; Koch was bought by Royal Ordnance in 1991.
According to the prosecution, Royal Ordnance provided false end-user
certificates for Heckler &amp; Koch guns, stating their destination as the UK
rather than countries affected by German or international embargoes.
It is not clear from evidence before the court whether the alleged events
occurred when Royal Ordnance was government-owned, or after its 1987 sale to
British Aerospace.
Mr Paul Regan, a lawyer on the Scott inquiry team, said yesterday the
inquiry was 'already looking into' some activities of Royal Ordnance, along
with those of a number of other UK manufacturers, but had not been aware of
the trial in the town of Rottweil, Baden-Wurttemburg.
Mr Regan said the inquiry was investigating government claims that it did
not know that UK companies were contravening official guidelines on defence
exports to banned countries. 'The crucial point is that up until 1987 Royal
Ordnance was government-owned and they could not argue that they did not
know what its business was,' he said.
'If it emerges that a large consignment of something nasty went from Royal
Ordnance to Iraq then we are interested in when it went, was there a proper
export licence, how did it leave the country, was the government aware, or
could they have taken steps to prevent it,' he said.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said that if the alleged arms
dealing took place before the sale of Royal Ordnance, it would imply that
British officials had been 'sleazy and corrupt'.
'It is mindboggling that a British government should have been so
unprincipled as to allow the sale of arms to countries that were our enemies
at the time,' he said.
There is as yet no suggestion that the inquiry - which is now due to report
in the summer - will be broadened beyond the issue of the export of dual-use
goods to Iraq between 1984 and 1990.
The Rottweil trial, like the Scott inquiry, is in recess until early in the
new year. The Scott team has had 130,000 documents to pore over, while Mr
Karl-Heinz Beiter, chief prosecutor at Rottweil, has spent more than five
years gathering evidence.
'Bringing the case to trial has been relatively slow,' said Mr Beiter. The
prosecution, with the assistance of the Federal Criminal Office, started
investigations in 1987 and finally pressed charges in January this year.
Both the Ministry of Defence and BAe declined to comment.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Spending on rail 'lags most of Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is investing less in its rail network than nearly all other western
European countries, says a survey of 12 countries by Rail Business Report,
an annual review.
Of the total Ecu120bn (Pounds 91bn) investment planned by European railways
over the next 10 years, Germany will spend Ecu62bn and France Ecu20bn
although spending per mile will be greatest in the Netherlands and
Switzerland. Only Finland will spend less per mile than Britain.
British Rail will spend Ecu4.4bn or Ecu425,000 per mile when projects such
as the Pounds 3bn Channel tunnel link, the Pounds 2.5bn London Crossrail
scheme and the Pounds 600m west coast main-line upgrading have been
excluded. There are no guarantees that the private sector will be willing to
finance these programmes, the report says.
Even if these projects were included Britain would still rank only seventh
in the European league table.
Consultants Steer, Davis and Gleave have been appointed to assess the impact
of electrifying the London-Sheffield main line.
The assessment will consider non-railway effects, including the likely
impact on road transport. Such studies were previously confined to
railway-related issues.

Researchers at Durham University claim to have identified seven factors
which indicate which entrepreneurs have the greatest potential for business
success.
The seven factors are:
Vision - the ability to project an image into the future of where the
individual would like their business to be.
Need for achievement - motivation to succeed and the ability to set
realistic goals and a structure to achieve them.
Need for autonomy, but also an ability to accept information and guidance
from others.
Calculated risk taking - the ability to evaluate risk and plan a strategy to
reduce it.
Opportunistic tendency - the ability to perceive opportunities for business
development within the surrounding environment.
Internal locus of control - an acceptance of personal responsibility for the
business's performance rather than explaining success or failure by external
factors such as luck and chance.
Creativity and innovation.
The conclusions were gleaned by Durham University Business School from a
review of other research and tested on a sample of 16 graduate entrepreneurs
and 100 past and present Midlands small businesses.
Mr David Johnson, lecturer in entrepreneurship at the school, who directed
the research, said: 'It may be crashingly obvious, but people don't seem to
use the information.'
The challenge, he said, was not only to define the entrepreneurial behaviour
which can lead to business success but to devise a way of assessing
accurately in what measure people have it and whether it can be developed
through training. That information would be valuable to organisations such
as banks and venture capital companies which have to decide who to back.
'The bottom line is, can you add any objectivity to the gut feeling when
you're interviewing people and deciding whether to support them in running
their own business?' he said.
The initial findings, to be published in early 1994, will be linked to
training workshops for users. The aim of the workshops is partly to prevent
the seven factors, on each of which entrepreneurs are graded from 1 to 7,
being used as a crude rejection tool.
The 18-month Pounds 24,000 project was co-sponsored by CPCR, a
Newcastle-based management consultancy, and County Durham and Leicestershire
Training and Enterprise Councils.
The seven factors, Mr Johnson stresses, are based on behaviour rather than
innate personality, so business owners can influence their own success.
Already he has one graphic example of a successful opportunistic tendency:
one graduate entrepreneur interviewed for the research used this 'foot in
the door' to fix up some work at the business school for her training
agency.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Lincoln university land deal near
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The company set up to found Lincolnshire University is about to buy 40 acres
of derelict land in central Lincoln from British Rail Property Board.
The purchase of land beside the old Roman harbour will be the first big
capital expenditure for the first new university to be built in the UK for
25 years.
'We hope to purchase the site within the next month or so,' said Mr David
Cook, chief executive of Lincolnshire University Company.
Finance to buy a campus site for the university is coming from a grant of
Pounds 10m by Lincolnshire County Council and a further grant of Pounds 1m
by Lincoln City Council. The two councils are the first subscribers of funds
for the university which will open in October 1996.
The total cost of setting up the new university is put at Pounds 32m. Mr
Paul Hodgkinson, chairman of Simons, the Lincoln-based construction group,
who is leading a committee to raise finance, said he hopes to obtain
contributions of about Pounds 15m from the private sector.
'We are getting a good response, but we've not yet gone out to a mass
audience,' he said. 'We expect to do a lot of work over the Christmas
period.'
Mr Cook said: 'Fundraising is a discreet dinner party exercise at the
moment.'
Lincolnshire University Company is preparing an application to the European
Commission for financial support. Mr Cook said approaches for derelict land
grant are being made to English Partnerships, the new government
regeneration agency headed by Lord Walker.
The idea for the university came from the Confederation of British Industry
which in the late 1980s argued that lack of a university at Lincoln hindered
economic development in the county.
Plans for a private university along the lines of Buckingham have been
abandoned in favour of a joint public-private sector approach. After a
beauty contest of educational institutions, Nottingham Trent University was
selected to guide the initial academic progress of the new university.
Mr Cook said student numbers would grow from 500 in October 1996 to 2,000 in
1998 and 5,000 in the year 2000. The university will draw on US experience
where, said Mr Cook, the message is that universities have to be integrated
into the community.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Charles Love - bank chief: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Love, the chief executive of Clydesdale Bank and a prominent
figure in the Scottish business community, died suddenly on Tuesday while on
holiday in France.
Mr Love, aged 48, had been chief executive of Clydesdale for little over a
year. He was appointed in succession to Mr Richard Cole-Hamilton, after
joining the bank earlier in 1992.
Sir David Nickson, the bank's chairman, said it was 'particularly tragic to
lose someone who, nearing the peak of a brilliant and successful career,
still had much more to give both to the bank and to the community at large'.
Mr Love was a popular and influential figure, whose death would have
implications that would be widely felt, he said.
Mr Love was born in Midlothian and educated at Musselburgh Grammar School.
He spent much of his career at the TSB, where he became chairman of TSB
Asset Finance in 1989 and branch banking director of TSB Bank in 1991. He
was chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland between 1990 and 1992.
Mr Love held a number of senior positions in public life. He was appointed
deputy chairman of the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers in 1991 and
was a member of the CBI Scottish Council between 1990 and 1992. He also
served with the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland and the Scottish
Council Development and Industry.
He is survived by his wife June and by a son and daughter.

An estranged husband was charged yesterday with carrying out a mail bomb
campaign against his wife's family - killing her mother, sister, stepfather
and two others with bombs sent to six different places, Reuter reports from
Rochester.
The wife, who was questioned by police, did not receive a bomb in the blitz
for which a second man was also charged.
News of the arrests and that the targets were all from the same family
calmed nerves over a wide area of northern New York state where residents
had earlier reported dozens of suspicious packages.
Prosecutors announced the arrests 24 hours after the six parcel bombs were
sent out to members of the Fowler family in the Buffalo and Rochester areas
early on Tuesday evening. Police sources said one of the men arrested was
the estranged husband of a member of the family and that the second man was
his friend.
Beside the five deaths two people were injured in the attacks.
Two packages were disarmed before they could explode.

The US yesterday said it would soon begin talks with Mexico and Canada to
speed tariff reductions negotiated under the North American Free Trade
Agreement on such items as flat glass, foods, wine, bedding components, and
big household appliances, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Tariffs are scheduled to be phased out over 15 years. However, the Clinton
administration has promised to accelerate reductions for products where the
Mexican or Canadian duty is substant-ially higher than the US tariff.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the US, in most cases, would
request the reduction for non-controversial products.
Three rounds of tariff acceleration talks have already been held under the
US-Canada Free Trade Agreement, yielding accelerated duty reductions on
Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) in two-way trade.
Trade officials will give priority to petitions received by January 21.
Petitions received by February 25 will be considered later in the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's gold and foreign exchange reserves have hit a record Dollars 13bn
(Pounds 8.7bn), reflecting the improved economic outlook for the world's
12th largest economy, Reuter reports from Bombay.
The Reserve Bank of India yesterday said the country's gold and foreign
currency reserves had reached Dollars 13.01bn on December 17, up from
Dollars 8.9bn a year ago. Bankers said the Reserve Bank was taking in up to
Dollars 100m a day as part of its decision to hold the rupee at around 31.37
to the dollar.
On the day the government faced demands in parliament for the resignation of
Finance Minister Manmohan Singh for failing to prevent last year's
securities scandal, bankers and economists said the improved economy
reflected the liberalisation policies of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao.
'The overall economy is moving out of recession. The underlying trend is
buoyant,' said Mr Narayanan Vaghul, chairman of ICICI, a leading Indian
financial institution. But some core sectors, such as steel and cement,
dependent on government expenditure, remained depressed because of spending
cuts.
The government projects growth in real gross domestic product in the current
fiscal year, ending in March, at 4.5 per cent, up from 4 per cent last year
and 1.3 per cent in 1991-92. India's economic reforms have started
attracting the attention of overseas investors, with Dollars 3bn in
investment approvals since Mr Rao took power.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Japan's trade negotiators face a tough new year: Tokyo is
braced for more US market pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The office buildings in Tokyo's central business district have lowered their
shutters for the new year holidays, but Japan's trade negotiators are
unlikely to be in festive mood as they welcome the advent of 1994.
They face a series of sessions with US trade officials throughout January in
the run-up to a summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa scheduled for February 11.
But as the summit approaches, Japan's relationship with the US, its most
important trading partner, is showing signs of renewed strain.
Earlier this week, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, voiced
unhappiness over market figures which showed that foreign semiconductor
makers' share of the Japanese market had declined this year. The numbers
raised 'serious concerns regarding Japan's commitment to fully implement the
Semiconductor Arrangement', Mr Kantor said, calling for an emergency
bilateral meeting in January to discuss the issue.
The semiconductor accord calls for Japan to improve its market share of
foreign semiconductors to an average of 20 per cent over the four quarters
of 1993, at a minimum, Mr Kantor said.
Mr Kantor's remarks were echoed by Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of
state, who expressed concern over the fall in foreign market share and
further blamed Japan for the lack of progress in the bilateral framework
trade and economic negotiations.
'There are, perhaps, a number of internal reasons in Japan relating to their
own political situation, but that does not in any way diminish the need from
the standpoint of the US for us to see solid progress' in reducing the
bilateral trade imbalance, Mr Christopher said.
The sharp US statements follow a letter Mr Kantor sent in mid-December to
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese financial daily, saying that Japan's
trade barriers and its current account surplus reduced opportunities for
jobs and manufacturing not only in the US but in Japan and the rest of the
world as well.
Such pressure on Japan suggests growing impatience in the US over the lack
of progress in bilateral trade negotiations agreed between the two
governments this summer.
When President Clinton and Mr Hosokawa meet in February, the two sides are
scheduled to report what has been achieved so far in the agreed areas of
negotiation, particularly in efforts to increase market access and sales of
foreign goods and services in Japan.
However, as both US and Japanese officials admit, there is still a
considerable gap between the kinds of measures the US wants Japan to adopt
to increase foreign market access, and those which Tokyo is willing to
accept.
In particular, Japanese trade officials have steadfastly refused to accept
any quantitative targets which could be construed as a commitment by the
government to ensure a certain level of sales or market share by foreign
companies.
As the two sides remain deadlocked, US officials may be hoping that by
increasing the heat on Japan, they will be able to pressure Japanese
officials into a last-minute compromise.
While accepting Mr Kantor's request for an emergency meeting on
semiconductors, Japanese officials express dismay at the aggressive approach
being adopted by the US.
'The more the US dwells on the 20 per cent market share figure, the more
there is the feeling in Japan that no matter what they call it, numerical
targets take on a life of their own,' one official at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
Under the agreement, Japan recognised the US expectation that the foreign
share of the Japanese semiconductor market would reach 20 per cent by the
end of 1992. The US has, however, come to consider the 20 per cent figure a
commitment by the Japanese government.
While a successful outcome of the framework talks is clearly high on the US
agenda, the Japanese government remains consumed by difficulties it has
encountered in getting political reform approved and with stimulating the
domestic economy.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee Mr Hosokawa will still be leading the
government by the time he is scheduled to meet Mr Clinton.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Winds of change whistle down Tokyo's corridors of power: An
'island of stability' is under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Power in Japan is concentrated in Kasumigaseki, where a few broad streets
are lined with buildings that are home to Tokyo's bureaucrats.
In cramped conditions, with desks carefully arranged to reflect the
occupier's place in the hierarchy, the graduates of the great universities,
Tokyo and Kyoto, preside over the drafting of policy, confident they have
guided Japan to its post-war prosperity.
Senior bureaucrats are fond of portraying Kasumigaseki as an island of
stability and enlightenment, remote in attitude from the adjoining
parliamentary district of Nagatacho where the often grubby business of
politics is conducted.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international trade and industry, defiantly
crossed the line between the two districts last week by forcing the
resignation of Mr Masahisa Naito, director-general of Miti's industrial
policy bureau, and one of the country's most powerful bureaucrats.
The case stirred fears among the bureaucracy that the new coalition
government intends to increase the power of ministers at the expense of
their ministries. Bureaucrats had been made uneasy by a deregulation drive
intended to reduce their influence, but the campaign by Mr Kumagai was seen
as a direct attack on the bureaucracy.
Urged by colleagues to resist the unwanted political intrusion, Mr Naito
admitted he had erred by promoting a ministry official who was leaving to
become a candidate for the Liberal Democratic party. The official also
happened to be the son of another senior Miti bureaucrat who had pushed for
the promotion.
Mr Naito had earlier said the resignation demand was unfair, and a dozen
other Miti officials offered to resign in sympathy.
These resignations are yet to be submitted, and public sentiment has swung
against a bureaucracy perceived to be more conscious of the privileges than
the responsibilities of office.
The case highlighted the political affiliations of the bureaucracy. Mr
Kumagai, a former Miti official, was taking aim at bureaucrats seen to be
close to the LDP, which ruled for four decades until losing its majority at
a July election. Links with the LDP were handy for bureaucrats, particularly
for those with an eye on a second career in politics.
But the bureaucrats' desire to have Kasumigaseki recognised as Tokyo's high
moral ground was undermined by this partisanship and by the acquiescence of
ministries in recent construction, trucking and financial industry scandals.
One senior Miti official said yesterday many bureaucrats are conscious their
best protection against politicians is to be seen to be clean and competent.
In using deregulation to wrest influence from the bureaucracy, the coalition
government is aware that the ministries' power resides in the vagueness of
Japanese laws and in the maze of administrative regulations and conflicting
interpretations built around these laws.
The Japanese parliament, for example, introduced legislation to bring
financial reform in April, but the extent and timing of reforms are still
controlled by officials in the finance ministry.
Banks' entry into the securities business has been slowed, and ministry
regulations demand staff at a securities subsidiary wear a uniform
completely different to that of the parent bank.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa came to office promising he would take a
hatchet to such regulations and make the conduct of government more
transparent. He complained that as a prefectural governor he was unable to
move a bus stop without the approval of bureaucrats in Tokyo.
'If bureaucrats continue struggling to protect or expand their vested
interests, they will end up increasing the inconvenience to the people they
are meant to serve,' Mr Hosokawa said in a thin volume of his thoughts
entitled The Time to Act is Now.
The bureaucracy takes comfort from instability within the coalition, a
hotchpotch of seven parties likely to face another election next year.
More than Mr Hosokawa, officials are wary of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who pulled
together the coalition and runs the Japan Renewal party. Mr Ozawa is close
to Mr Kumagai, and the two are agreed elected politicians should tackle the
unelected bureaucrats.
Part of the Ozawa agenda is that politicians should serve longer as
ministers to build expertise in their area and reduce their dependence on
bureaucrats, who write speeches and answer questions in parliament on behalf
of their masters.
But ministers are unlikely to secure long terms in a shaky political
environment, while an LDP government would want business as usual and would
hardly pursue an official of Mr Naito's political leanings.
The next direct confrontation between coalition and bureaucracy is expected
to be a bout between the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan
Socialist party, and the finance ministry, which is pushing for an overhaul
of the taxation system that the SDP dislikes.
The ministry wants an increase in the country's 3 per cent value-added tax,
and the SDP would like companies and the wealthy to pay more tax to
compensate for a decrease in revenues.
But the SDP's largest obstacle in charging the barricades at the ministry is
one of its partners in government: Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister,
who was an official at the ministry before entering politics.
From his speech on appointment as minister, to most of his recent public
statements, Mr Fujii has relied on his old friends the bureaucrats; they are
unlikely to allow a rewrite of their script.

FT  30 DEC 93 / A 'stealth' adviser refines his targets: Tony Lake's
confidence in US policies towards Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An enormous painting of a bull dominates Tony Lake's office in the White
House. If the president's national security adviser were in the habit of
rolling his eyes in despair, as he might have been tempted to at times over
the last year, he could not miss it.
Although Mr Lake owns a farm, the agricultural analogy should stop there. A
better label for him came recently from the Washington Post, which called
him the 'stealth' adviser, unseen but not lacking in firepower. As befits
the better academics, he speaks precisely, with humour and preferably
off-the-record, though he has begun to give more public speeches.
Like other members of the Clinton foreign policy team, he will concede
'bumps' have occurred in the relationship between the US and western Europe,
not only because of well-publicised disagreements over Bosnia and trade but
because of the evolution, for the first time in many years, of a coherent US
policy towards Asia.
This led to the 'perception' in Europe that it was being neglected in favour
of Asia. Yet, in the Lake view, little has changed, since Europe, with
Japan, remains at 'the core' of US foreign policy. What has moved on are the
challenges all three are facing.
Economic difficulties and new uncertainties, specifically on the state of
Russia, produce both the desire for change and fear of it. 'This can
translate,' he says, speaking for the record, 'into a lack of political will
to come to grips with the newness of the (post-Cold War) world.'
Except that he does not think this has happened. A veteran of the Carter
state department, Mr Lake sees no comparisons today with the sour
relationship between the former US president and the then-Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt of West Germany.
Mr Clinton may not have been to Europe this year but his appointments diary
shows he met about as many European leaders in Washington in his first year
as President George Bush did in 1989. He considers his own contacts with his
foreign policy counterparts across the Atlantic to be optimal. Three
presidential trips to Europe in the first seven months of the coming year
ought to assuage European doubts, but, more than that, they are designed to
give even greater substance to the relationship.
Mr Lake gives economic security a high priority in US foreign policy but,
perhaps tacitly acknowledging fears of a resurgent US economic nationalism,
does not put it on quite the same pedestal as other members of the
administration have. He rates it alongside conventional security problems
and the promotion of democracy.
The cornerstone of the US approach to European security lies in the
Partnership for Peace, criticised in some quarters as too gradualist a
programme to bring the countries of eastern Europe into the Nato net. When
he was in Washington earlier this month, Mr Andrej Olechowsky, Polish
foreign minister, did not conceal his disappointment with the co-operation
on offer, especially in the light of the new menace of Russian nationalism
evident in its elections.
The US view is that western and eastern Europe, including Russia, face
'huge' choices and that Partnership for Peace, an evolutionary process, is
deliberately designed to make those choices easier and less dependent on
what happens in Russia. The 'habits of co-operation' explicit in the new
approach may have no time-frame but, in stressing longer-term
practicalities, also close no doors. This is the message Mr Clinton will
give to the leaders of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in Prague next
month after the Nato summit.
The national security adviser does not believe Russian nationalism will get
out of hand, but is convinced that the US must do nothing to contribute to
its growth by pursuing policies that might be construed as threatening in
Moscow. Equally, US economic assistance to Russia, while not neglecting
longer-term reform goals, must also be geared to help meet shorter-term
practical needs.
US policy generally is committed to ensuring the continued viability of
Nato, while reshaping it to meet new problems. Encouragement is taken from
the fact that the Nato enforcement of the 'no fly zone' over Bosnia
constitutes an important 'out of area' precedent for the organisation. If
the US commits troops to enforce any peace settlement, it will only do so as
part of a Nato operation.
Mr Lake's worst moments this year have been over Somalia, as they were for
Mr Les Aspin, the departing defence secretary, and he is reported to have
offered to resign after 18 US servicemen were killed in Mogadishu. He seems
now far more optimistic, even on getting North Korea to drop its nuclear
ambitions, but not because he wants or even sees the emergence of some rigid
new world order. To him, disorderliness opens the door for creative
diplomacy, especially in harness with western Europe and Japan.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Patten attacks China on Basic Law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, yesterday accused China of making up
the Basic Law, its post-1997 constitution for the territory, as it went
along and of indiscriminately throwing out proposals discussed by the
governments of Britain and the colony and in the interests of Hong Kong
people.
Responding to a statement issued by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office
on Monday saying China would disband all elected bodies when it regains
sovereignity in 1997, Mr Patten said it reflected the rule of man rather
than the rule of law.
'Even if that was reasonable, it's clean against the Basic Law itself,
Article 160 for example. It's not a matter for the Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office to decide what is or is not in line with the Basic Law. It's
a matter for the National People's Congress standing committee. So I don't
know what the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office think they are doing.
'Their position appears to be that whatever Hong Kong people want, whatever
the Legislative Council discusses, whatever we propose in the Hong Kong
government or the British government, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office
and senior Chinese officials will throw it out,' he said.
He added that legislative councillors would ensure fair and open electoral
arrangements prevailed at the end of the day.

<TEXT>
Hong Kong plans to turn the colony into a regional broadcasting hub by
scrapping some restrictions on foreign ownership of television stations,
Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
But the government will press ahead with controversial legislation limiting
cross-media ownership, Mr James So, secretary for recreation and culture,
said yesterday.
'What we will do basically is to encourage more people to come to Hong Kong
to set up television, either through cable or satellite or other forms,
through the relaxation of the rule,' Mr So said.
Foreign ownership is currently restricted to 49 per cent of non-franchised
television stations.
The proposed relaxation, to be included in a media law now being drafted,
would not cover Hong Kong's two conventional television stations, Television
Broadcasts (TVB) and Asia Television (ATV), where tighter rules apply.
Apart from the two franchise broadcasters, pan-Asian satellite station Star
TV and cable station Wharf Cable, are based in Hong Kong.
Mr Rupert Murdoch, who controls Star TV through his News Corp, skirted the
foreign ownership rule last July by buying 63.6 per cent of HutchVision,
which in turn owns less than half of the licensee, HutchVision Hong Kong. Mr
Murdoch fell foul of the rules earlier in the year and was forced to
withdraw a bid for a stake in TVB.

Promoters for Michael Jackson's cancelled 'Dangerous' tour sued the
entertainer on Tuesday for more than Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m), claiming he
was addicted to morphine and Demerol long before he sought treatment, AP
reports from Los Angeles.
Jackson bowed out of the tour on its Mexico City leg in November when he
admitted an addiction to prescription painkillers and sought treatment at an
undisclosed location, apparently in Europe.
Jackson said at the time he was taking prescription pain-killers after
undergoing painful scalp surgery. He said his depression after a 13-year-old
boy accused him of sexual abuse helped cause his drug addiction.
Mama Concerts, a German corporation, Pebbles Music, a California company,
and promoter Marcel Avram of Munich, filed the lawsuit in Superior Court,
California's highest state court, said attorney Donald Engel.
The lawsuit claims breach of contract, fraud, fraudulent concealment,
negligent misrepresentation and conspiracy to defraud.

FT  30 DEC 93 / US indicators promise good start to 1994
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy is poised for a healthy start to the new year according to
the administration's principal measure of future economic prospects.
The index of leading economic indicators rose by 0.5 per cent in November,
the fourth consecutive monthly rise.
At the same time, sales of existing homes rose in November by 2.9 per cent
to a record annualised rate of 4.21m homes, according to the National
Association of Realtors.
The main components contributing to the rise in the index of leading
economic indicators were lower claims for unemployment benefits, increased
orders for new commercial buildings and business equipment and higher prices
for raw materials, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The department said eight of the 11 elements of the index were pointing
upwards in November, including more requests for building permits, stronger
orders for consumer goods and longer average work weeks.
The index of coincident indicators, intended to mark the pace of current
economic activity, rose 0.5 per cent in November, also the fourth
consecutive monthly rise.
Mr Bob Elrod, president of the realtors' association, said buoyant home
sales were driven by buyers' increased confidence in the economy.
'Consumers are reading the market accurately, knowing that conditions are
prime for buying. An increase in resales on this magnitude is a substantial
vote of confidence in the economy,' he said.
The realtors' survey showed home sales rising strongly in the Midwest, east
and south last month, but falling in western states. The median house price
rose fractionally to Dollars 106,800 (Pounds 75,600), 4 per cent higher than
a year earlier.
Surveys such as the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, published
earlier this week, show that the almost unfaltering strength of recent
economic statistics has produced a surge of optimism in the US. Sales
indications show this feeding through to purchases of expensive items such
as homes, household appliances and cars.
The steady diet of good economic news has encouraged some economists to
predict growth rates for the whole US economy of more than 4 per cent in the
fourth quarter.
Although that pace is not expected to be sustained in the new year, most
economists believe steady growth of around 3 per cent is likely in the first
six months of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's Senate passed early yesterday a bill calling for constitutional
reform allowing President Carlos Menem to run for a second term in 1995 and
continue his economic reforms, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires.
The Senate approval, by 38 votes to seven, fulfilled the last requirement
for Mr Menem to convene a constitutional assembly next year. The lower house
had voted for a reform last week. The reform will permit the removal from
the 140-year-old constitution of a clause banning presidents from running
for successive terms.
Mr Menem struck a deal to that end last month with his predecessor, Mr Raul
Alfonsn of the opposition Radical party, who handed over power in a rush in
1989 as hyperinflation threatened to tear the country apart.
Four years later, Mr Menem has brought annual consumer price increases down
to a single digit from the 5,000 per cent inflation rate during 1989.
Mr Menem said this week he was planning to call an election for March 20 to
choose delegates to the constitutional assembly.
Heeding the terms of the pact between Mr Menem and Mr Alfonsn as the lower
house had already done, the Senate went along with the reform bill but
stripped it of a clause shortening senatorial terms to four years from nine.
The senators say that if presidential terms are to be cut to four years from
six, theirs should be cut to six from nine, rather than to four.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Security stepped up in Crimea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Ukrainian authorities have been increasing the level of security in the
Crimean peninsula after a month of violence and crime in the area which is
home to the disputed Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea fleet.
The move comes less than three weeks before the republic's presidential
elections.
Four Crimean politicians have been murdered since mid- November, including a
Ukrainian member of parliament, the head of the Black Sea fleet's press
centre and a Crimean presidential candidate.
On Tuesday it was reported that armed Ukrainian marines seized two fleet
offices. No shots were fired. Cross-accusations of misconduct, such as the
office seizures, are frequent.
Ukrainian navy officials have accused Russian officers of trying to prevent
servicemen from taking an oath of loyalty to Ukraine.
While these incidents have been small and isolated, they are indicative of
increasing tension in the region, once the tranquil holiday playground of
the Kremlin elite.
Fuelling the instability is the unresolved dispute over ownership of the
Black Sea fleet, a serious obstacle in Russian-Ukrainian relations since the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
Russia is likely continue to press for full ownership of the fleet in
exchange for offsetting Ukraine's Dollars 2.5bn energy debt. President
Leonid Kravchuk agreed to consider this formula at last September's
Russian-Ukrainian summit. However, the rise of Russia's nationalists has
made Ukraine more wary of relinquishing its share of the navy despite its
severe energy crisis.
The danger in Crimea is that Ukrainians might respond to imperialist
rhetoric by becoming more anti-Russian, and that ethnic Russians who make up
roughly 70 per cent of the Crimean population, will step up their
pro-Russian campaign to break away from Ukraine. The ultra-nationalist Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky brought out a huge vote among Russian citizens in the
coastal city of Sevastopol, the Black Sea fleet's base.
The Crimea was removed from Russian jurisdiction and gifted to Ukraine by
the Soviet leader Mr Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 as a symbolic gesture to mark
300 years of friendship between the two nations.
The Russian Space Agency announced yesterday that it had reached a
preliminary agreement to lease the ex- Soviet Baikonur Cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan.
Russia hopes to make commercial satellite launches from this installation,
while Kazakhstan is looking to offset its Dollars 1.3bn debt to Russia.
Mr Yuri Koptev, head of the agency, added that a final agreement could also
include Russian access to Kazakh military sites such as the Semipalatinsk
nuclear testing ground.
It was unclear how this potential arrangement would affect Kazakhstan's
newly acquired non-nuclear status.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Belgrade spirits away zeros from spiralling dinar
</HEADLINE>

   By LAURA SILBER

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In another desperate attempt to slow hyperinflation, the Yugoslav National
Bank yesterday slashed nine zeros from dinar notes.
The move, which will mean 1bn dinars is now equivalent to one dinar, had
been expected to go into effect on January 1. But Politika, the Serbian
newspaper, yesterday reported that huge payments of pensions, wages and
consumer spending before New Year holidays had forced early redenomination.
Economists said that only draconian measures - including stopping the
printing of money and massive reductions in government spending - could
salvage the dinar. They believed the increased spending expected yesterday
would force the dinar to plummet even further on the black market.
Belgrade economists also said redenomination was introduced earlier than
scheduled as the national mint - working 24 hours a day - could not print
notes fast enough to keep pace with inflation.
Public disquiet surfaced yesterday when Serbian coal miners went on strike,
demanding wages in hard currency. Tanjug news agency said power cuts would
come into effect today.
On October 1 the central bank slashed six noughts from dinar banknotes. The
official rate of monthly inflation climbed to 20,190 per cent in November
and is expected to soar to 250,000-500,000 per cent for December.
The average monthly pension can buy 13 loaves of bread for 1,690bn dinars
(DM1.8). On Friday the National Bank issued a 500bn dinar note, the highest
denomination and equivalent at the time to DM7 on the black market. By
yesterday afternoon the note had plunged to about 40 pfennigs.
The D-Mark has virtually replaced the local currency. Shopkeepers mostly
demand payment in D-Marks or change their prices on an hourly basis. Pfennig
coins, DM5 and DM10 notes are prized.
A Belgrade grocer said she usually raised her prices by a 'enormous
percentage' in order to have a day off from constantly rewriting new prices
as the dinar dropped.
People are often paid in bread, sugar, oil or meat rather than increasingly
worthless dinars. In state stores, prices are no longer expressed in dinars
but in 'bodes', points in Serbo-Croat, which are tied to the D-Mark.
The economy of the rump Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - has been hit by
the collapse of trade between the former Yugoslav republics. It has also
been devasted by bills for nearly three years of war in Bosnia and Croatia,
exacerbated by United Nations sanctions.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Italian government cash rescues Rai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday approved an emergency L700bn (Pounds 282m)
financial package to prevent the state-run broadcasting corporation, the
Rai, from bankruptcy proceedings.
The package has been the subject of intense negotiations between the
government, political parties and Rai management. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
the prime minister, agreed to provide the aid only after being given
evidence of a major reorganisation at the Rai and cuts of L370bn next year.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who controls more than 85 per cent
of Italian commercial television and who nurtures political ambitions,
attacked the government rescue of rival channels. 'This is the final blow at
the end of the year: a government which regards its task as complete decides
to allocate some L500bn of public money to the coffers of the Rai.'
The Rai is expected to have accumulated losses of L560bn at the end of this
year, with a further L750bn expected in 1994. Management has been unable to
fund the usual extra month's Christmas pay.
The measures are primarily a book-keeping exercise. The government has
allowed a L300bn increase in the value of the Rai's fixed assets. It has
also accepted the conversion into equity of L360bn owed to the treasury.
At the same time the government is allowing a 5 per cent increase in the
annual licence fee from L148,000 to L156,000. The fee has been unchanged for
five years. Also the proportion of the licence fee going directly to the Rai
has been increased from 84 per cent to 91 per cent.
A final boost to the broadcaster's finances will come from a reduction in
the annual concession fee paid to the state. This will be cut from L165bn to
below L40bn, more in line with that paid by commercial networks.
The Rai is owned by Iri, the state holding company, but the debt conversion
means that the treasury's deposit guarantee institute will become a
shareholder. The government has insisted on a sixth board member to
represent this stake, giving it a direct say in management.
Traditionally, the Rai has been answerable to the leaders of the main
political parties who agreed a carve-up of influence so that the
broadcaster's first and main channel was controlled by the Christian
Democrats, the second by the Socialists and the third by the Communists, now
the Party of the Democratic Left. The outgoing parliament could still
sabotage the package.
In the past six months new management has sought to end this political
control, budgets have been trimmed, some 800 jobs have been cut and star
entertainers have been asked to take salary cuts of up to 20 per cent. A
further 900 jobs are expected to go next year.
Magistrates have also been called in to investigate corruption in the
construction of a new headquarters and suppliers' contracts.
The broader issue of the future of state-run television is unlikely to be
addressed until after the next general election. But Mr Berlusconi's
political ambitions and the way he obtained his commercial networks from a
now discredited Christian Democrat and Socialist dominated government will
bring the question of television services into sharp relief.

Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Russia's ultra-nationalist leader, yesterday
returned to Moscow after a controversial 10-day trip to Europe, during which
he was refused an entry visa to Germany and Bulgarian authorities expelled
him.
Mr Zhirinovsky and seven of his aides had been due to arrive in Berlin last
night at the start of an 18-day visit. However, a spokesman for Germany's
Foreign Ministry said the leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic party was
barred from entering the country on the grounds that his presence would
damage German interests.
The German media had earlier this month sharply criticised the authorities
for granting Mr Zhirinovsky a visa.
Bulgarian authorities deported the maverick politician after accusing him of
meddling in the country's internal affairs. Mr Zhirinovsky, who is reported
to have referred to President Zhelyu Zhelev as 'scum', was stranded at Sofia
airport because of a pilots' strike.
The Russian politician has hardly spared a government or leader from his
insults since embarking on his trip to Europe 10 days ago. Romania's
parliamentary deputies and senators yesterday condemned Mr Zhirinovsky's
statement in which he referred to their nation as 'an artificial state of
Italian gypsies'.
He also accused Greece and Turkey of planning to conquer the Balkans.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has distanced itself from Mr Zhirinovsky and
said attention only served to give him more publicity.
'Russia has nothing to do with the statements of the Liberal Democratic
party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky and does not share his opinions,' an
official said.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Chretien's deft footwork keeps Liberals' stock high: The
Canadian PM's down-to-earth style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean Chretien has enjoyed a remarkable honeymoon in the seven weeks since
becoming Canada's 20th prime minister. This is not because he has shirked
any difficult decisions; on the contrary, he has tackled a long list of
politically risky initiatives.
Despite earlier promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade
Agreement, his new Liberal government will implement the pact as scheduled
on January 1. Mr Chretien has also scrapped the previous Conservative
government's plan to privatise the country's biggest airport, and cancelled
a contentious CDollars 5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) helicopter order.
The Liberals have also flown in the face of advice from business leaders and
foreign investors by replacing Mr John Crow, the inflation-fighting governor
of the Bank of Canada. And the prime minister has sent unambiguous signals
since taking office of plans for a thorough overhaul of social security
programmes such as unemployment insurance and welfare. The 10 provinces have
been told to expect little, if any, increase in the federal transfers which
help fund their health, education and welfare budgets.
The initiatives have so far been greeted with little dissent. The latest
Gallup poll shows the Liberals riding high, with the support of 56 per cent
of decided voters. This is their highest approval rating since 1970, and far
above the 41 per cent of the vote which brought them to power in October.
Fears that Mr Crow's departure would send the Canadian dollar into free fall
have turned out to be groundless. The Liberals are now being applauded for
replacing him with his more personable deputy, Mr Gordon Thiessen, and for
promising to hold the inflation rate below 3 per cent until at least 1998.
The dollar has risen by more than one US cent in the past week to 75.50 US
cents.
Mr Chretien, who will take a break from domestic politics next week for a
trip to London, Paris and the Nato summit in Brussels, is given much of the
credit for the Liberals' adroit footwork.
The new prime minister often describes himself as just 'a little guy from
Shawinigan' (his home town in rural Quebec). He has neither the intellect of
his mentor, Mr Pierre Trudeau, nor the brokering skills of his Conservative
predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney. But, as one observer puts it, Mr Chretien's
political instincts are as firm as the footing of a mountain goat.
His experience is unrivalled among Canadian politicians; he celebrated his
30th anniversary as a member of parliament this year, having held almost
every key portfolio during the Liberals' last period in office in the 1970s
and early 1980s.
The previous Conservative government, hobbled by the public's mistrust of
former prime minister Brian Mulroney, was wary of potentially unpopular
initiatives in its last few years in office. But Mr Chretien's down-to-earth
style contrasts sharply with Mr Mulroney's inflated rhetoric and imperious
demeanour.
The tough times of the past few years - unemployment still tops 11 per cent
and public-sector deficits are at record levels - have helped make Canadians
more receptive to the message of change.
Another factor in the new government's favour is its warm relations with the
civil service.
The Conservatives alienated senior bureaucrats by attaching large political
staffs to each cabinet minister's office. These appointees shielded
ministers from ideas generated in the civil service, while exposing them to
the influence of special interest groups.
Mr Chretien has sent strong signals to his mandarins that their advice will
be valued. Members of his cabinet have been told to keep their political
staffs to a minimum. More than one political observer has remarked that the
longest faces in Ottawa this winter belong to the lobbyists whose businesses
flourished in the Mulroney years.
The Liberals next big test starts on January 17, when the House of Commons
reconvenes for the first time since the election. A new opposition,
dominated by the separatist Bloc Quebecois and the right-of-centre Reform
party, will then begin peppering the government with questions and
criticisms.
Two issues are bound to keep the new government's hands full; Quebec
separatism and economic revival.
Mr Chretien would prefer to avoid a repetition of the interminable
constitutional wrangles which dogged Canadian politics in the late 1980s
over Quebec separatism. But a provincial election must be held in Quebec by
next autumn. The Bloc Quebecois and its provincial counterpart, the Parti
Quebecois, will seize every opportunity to promote the separatists' cause.
On the economic front, the Liberals face the delicate task of fulfilling
their campaign promise to create jobs and revive the economy, without
increasing the budget deficit.
They are pressing ahead with a modest CDollars 6bn public works programme,
to be funded by federal, provincial and municipal governments. But Mr Paul
Martin, finance minister, has damped expectations by revising the projected
federal deficit for the year to March 1994 to CDollars 44bn-CDollars 46bn,
far above the CDollars 32.6bn forecast by the Conservatives just eight
months ago.
Mr Martin has put out word that the Liberals' first budget, to be presented
in February or March, will be largely a holding operation.
The main event is now scheduled for early 1995, by when Mr Chretien and his
colleagues hope to have fleshed out their plans for new social security
programmes, tax reform and defence cuts.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Investment begins at home for Siemens: Aid helped to win
chip plant for Dresden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Siemens' decision to invest more than DM2.4bn (Pounds 950m) in a new
microchip production and research plant in Dresden may kill two birds with
one stone.
As Germany's largest electronics manufacturer, Siemens wants to base part of
its production and research at home with the aim of capturing more of the
European market. But choosing the eastern state of Saxony might also confirm
the 'leap-frog' theory in which sectors of the eastern German economy are
expected to become competitive through the introduction of the highest
levels of technology and expertise, rather than updating existing plant.
Siemens has traditionally gone abroad to manufacture the 64-megabyte memory
chips and the 256-megabyte chips used for telecommunications, mobile
telephones and vehicles. Its electronics divisions accounted for 65 per cent
of this year's DM81.7bn turnover. In the US, Siemens co-operates with IBM in
the manufacture of the 256 chip, and it produces semiconductors in
south-east Asia. But Mr Werner Gries, a senior official at Germany's federal
ministry for research and technology, believes Siemens wants to use its home
base to produce these two chips.
'Siemens ranks third in the sale of semiconductors in Europe,' he said. 'It
wants to go on the offensive. To enable it to do this, it will use the
production and research facilities in Dresden to capture the market in
Europe, and in other parts of the world.'
In Mr Gries' view, what was crucial about the Siemens approach in Saxony was
its decision to place research and production under one roof in Dresden. 'It
wants to be able to develop the next generation of chips but in a way in
which research and production can work much more closely.'
Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chief executive of Siemens, said production from the
200,000 square metre greenfield site in Dresden, expected to start in 1995,
will be largely export driven. 'What we are seeking is higher productivity,
greater innovation, and markets,' he said.
For the moment, the company would go it alone, but the door would be open
for IBM or Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company which already
co-operates with Siemens outside Germany.
Investment grants were an incentive in the choice of Dresden. The state of
Saxony, led by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, and the federal government, will provide
grants amounting to about 35 per cent of the DM2.4bn investment. In
addition, the European Union's regional development fund and the federal
ministry for research and technology is expected to provide DM300m.
Siemens officials denied that the grants would help offset high real wage
levels in eastern Germany. Wages are 20 per cent below western German levels
although productivity lags behind western counterparts by 60 to 70 per cent.
'You have to pay high wages for a highly skilled workforce in the computer
industry,' said a Siemens official.
Mr von Pierer said Saxony's traditionally strong industrial base and its
skilled workforce also contributed to the decision. Those skills will be
upgraded when Siemens, under contract with IBM, brings over 50 of its
specialists from the US. He also cited the lack of bureaucracy and red tape
which Mr Biedenkopf is renowned for cutting through.
For Saxony, the presence of Siemens could well reinforce the 'leap-frog
theory,' in which investment channelled into greenfield sites can be used to
introduce the highest levels of technology without using resources to
modernise existing plants.
Mr Joachim Fels, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank,
agrees. 'The leap-frog theory is happening slowly in some sectors in eastern
Germany where an investor goes for high quality jobs, high value jobs, and a
highly capital-intensive enterprise,' he said.
'But actually, there's really no other choice because eastern Germany cannot
offer a low-wage economy. That's where the incentives and grants play such a
big role. And probably these swung Siemens' decision to move to Dresden,' he
added.

Nigeria's military government yesterday appointed a panel to reorganise the
scandal-plagued Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Reuter reports from
Lagos.
The 10-member panel would also examine the accounts of state-owned NNPC,
which oversees Nigeria's oil industry and has been rocked by fraud
allegations.
The corporation supervises the export of more than 1.5m barrels of oil a
day, earning about Dollars 10bn a year and accounting for more than 90 per
cent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income.
Nigerian newspapers have recently given prominence to a World Bank report
which said Dollars 2.1bn of oil revenue in 1990, when the Gulf crisis
boosted oil prices, was unaccounted for by the military government then in
power.

Romania's opposition yesterday accused the government of violating the
constitution by passing a law allowing it to rule by decree during next
month's parliamentary winter recess, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
Some observers said the move was an attempt to push through unpopular new
taxes agreed as part of a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund.
Earlier, the hung parliament voted 159-1 in favour of the minority left-wing
government headed by Mr Nicoale Vacaroiu. Opposition deputies refused to
vote.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault is to cut 2,109 jobs in 1994, according to a plan presented to
unions yesterday, writes John Ridding in Paris.
The job cuts, which represent just under 5 per cent of the workforce at the
French state-owned car group, reflect attempts to adapt to the depressed
state of the European car market and to improve productivity.
The company said the cuts would be achieved through voluntary redundancies.
Most would come from early retirement for more than 1,100 employees, the
non-replacement of departing workers, and an increase in part-time
employment.
The plan is in line with demands from the centre-right government of Mr
Edouard Balladur that publicly-owned groups should avoid compulsory
redundancies in their restructuring efforts.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Vatican-Israel pact ready
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vatican and Israel are due to sign an agreement today normalising
diplomatic relations and smoothing over a troubled past between the Catholic
Church and the Jewish people.
The agreement has been painstakingly negotiated by a bilateral commission
established in July 1992 although the groundwork was laid in 1964 when Pope
Paul VI visited Jerusalem.
Both the Holy See and Israel stand to benefit from the agreement, finalised
in Rome yesterday. It formalises the Catholic Church's right to operate in
the Holy Land and lays the framework for property and fiscal rights in the
state of Israel.
Both sides also believe diplomatic relations will help in a small way
towards the Middle East peace process. Until now the Vatican has been
reluctant to formalise relations for fear of prejudicing its relations with
Arab countries, as well as because of the complex question of property
rights in the Holy Land and the issue of the status of Jerusalem.
Yesterday, Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said in Rome
he expected ambassadors could be exchanged within months.

FT  30 DEC 93 / BBV ready to run Banesto: Senior managers lined up to take
over main divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya, Spain's largest privately owned commercial bank, was
yesterday preparing to assume management control of Banco Espanol de Credito
following the dismissal of the Banesto board by the Bank of Spain.
Nine or 10 senior BBV executives were being considered by BBV last night to
run Banesto's main divisions. Mr Alfredo Saenz, BBV vice-president, was
named by the central bank on Tuesday as Banesto president in place of Mr
Mario Conde. The Spanish Finance Ministry meanwhile confirmed that its
insurance authority had intervened in Banesto's insurance affiliate, La
Union y El Fenix, dismissing the board headed by Mr Conde, and appointing
three officials to run the group.
Ownership of Union y Fenix, one of the biggest insurers in Spain, was in the
process of being transferred by Banesto to AGF of France, which holds 24 per
cent of the Spanish company. Last night it was unclear whether the transfer
would go ahead on the terms negotiated by the dismissed board.
At Banesto, the new board faces a difficult task. According to estimates in
Madrid, the value of the bank's assets would be reduced by about Pta 400bn
(Pounds 1.9bn) if its loan and equity portfolios were revalued correctly.
That figure includes an estimated Pta 80bn shortfall in the bank's pension
fund.
Although Banesto had raised about Dollars 775m (Pounds 520m) this year with
the help of the US commercial bank JP Morgan, it had clearly not been enough
to satisfy the central bank. Two weeks ago, Mr Conde was warned to come up
with a solution but had been unable to find funds.
The BBV is close to the government and the Bank of Spain, both of which want
Banesto merged with a healthy big Spanish bank. Analysts in Madrid said they
expected many of Banesto's assets - its industrial holdings, its regional
banking affiliate, Banco Vitoria, and its controlling stake in Portugal's
Banco Totta &amp; Acores - to be sold off, with the BBV taking the rump of the
parent banking business. Absorption of Banesto would make the BBV Spain's
biggest bank but it would involve trimming branches.
A senior Bank of Spain official said inspectors had found that Banesto's
need to provide for pensions had risen from some Pta30bn last year to nearly
Pta80bn in October.
He added that capital gains in Banesto's industrial corporation had been
incorrectly booked. Banesto and the Bank of Spain have long been in dispute
about Banesto's treatment of portfolio losses. Bank officials accused Mr
Conde of taking profits or losses, whichever made Banesto's figures seem
favourable.
Mr Roberto Mendoza, the Morgan vice-chairman most closely associated with
Banesto, was in Madrid yesterday. Morgan decided its Corsair banking fund
should invest Dollars 175m in Banesto earlier this year.

FT  30 DEC 93 / China will allow market forces to set exchange rate:
Official yuan rate abolished as Beijing steps up reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China underlined its determination to press ahead with market-oriented
economic reforms by announcing yesterday that the country's exchange rates
would be unified from January 1.
The present officially set rate for the yuan will be abolished. The new
single rate, expected to be based on that already quoted in 'swap centres',
where most foreign exchange transactions take place, will be controlled by
the state but will float and reflect market forces.
'This unitary and controlled floating exchange rate system based on market
demand and supply will replace the current dual-track system,' said the
central bank, quoted by the official Xinhua news agency.
The government had promised to reform the currency in 1994. The decision to
move earlier than expected suggests that Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in
charge of the economy and central bank governor, is retaining his authority
to push through reforms in the face of vested interests within the communist
system.
Fundamental changes to China's tax system are also being introduced from
January 1 even though mechanisms for central tax collection are not in
place. The changes include new tax-sharing arrangements between the central
government and the provinces and introduction of a nationwide consumption
tax. Reforms of the banking system are also in progress and deregulation of
prices is continuing.
Although the new rate for the yuan is not yet known, the currency reform is
likely to mean a substantial technical devaluation. Yesterday the official
rate stood at Yn5.8 to the US dollar, against Yn8.7 in the swap centres. In
practice, however, swap centres already account for four fifths of China's
trade-related transactions, according to Chinese officials.
To exercise control over the floating exchange rate, the central bank is
likely to intervene in swap market trading - as it did this summer when it
wanted to narrow a widening gap between the official and swap rates.
State-owned enterprises, heavily subsidised in being permitted to use the
official rate when importing goods, have increasingly been forced by the
government into using the swap market rate.
Nevertheless, the currency change will affect state industries - 37 per cent
of which are losing money - and may also worsen inflation, which is running
above 20 per cent in big cities.
Officials said foreign investors, who have had to register capital in new
ventures at the official rate but repatriate their profits at the swap
market rate, would benefit from yesterday's decision.
Ms Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation, said the
reform would assist China's efforts to join the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
The unification of rates means that Foreign Exchange Certificates, the
currency foreigners in China are required to use, will be phased out. FECs
are purchased at the official rate. No more will be printed.
Economists emphasised that the latest reforms do not mean that the yuan will
become freely convertible, a step likely to be some years away. The central
bank last night issued complex new rules on access to foreign exchange.

FT  30 DEC 93 / UK shares hit all-time high as world markets rise again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND and WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market made a powerful return from the Christmas holiday
yesterday with the FT-SE 100 Index gaining 49.7 points to reach an all-time
high of 3,462.0.
This marked its third largest daily gain of the year - although not in
percentage terms.
Retail stocks and banks led the market forward as London caught up with
record performances this week by other world markets and also anticipated
lower interest rates and continued UK economic recovery.
Favourable reports on Christmas trading from the retail sector encouraged
investors, whose expectation that domestic interest rates will fall in the
new year were buttressed by firmness in sterling and in UK government bonds.
However, some analysts now warn that any cut in base rates may be held back
until the spring when domestic consumers will feel the effects of tax
increases introduced in the Budget.
Government optimism over the economy and housing market reports from the
Halifax, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, also boosted investor confidence.
The FT-SE 100 index closed well below the day's best reading of 3,474.2 but
was still 1.5 per cent up on the session. On December 1, it registered a
rise of 66.3 points or 2.1 per cent. Yesterday a strong premium on the FT-SE
futures March contract again provided a lead.
Share prices were higher from the start of trading as international stocks
traded in the London market, which had been closed since Christmas Eve, took
on board strong performances recorded in Hong Kong, Tokyo and in other world
stock markets earlier this week.
Outside the UK, the markets which have risen the most this year - in Asia -
sustained their rallies as equities wobbled across continental Europe. New
highs were registered in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched to a another record
closing high, gaining 0.56 points to 3,794.33. In continental Europe,
Germany fell for the second successive day, closing around the 2,280 mark,
although the French CAC-index registered a new closing high.
Spanish stocks dropped another 1.5 per cent after Tuesday's 1.3 per cent
fall, shaken and apprehensive after the Bank of Spain dismissed the entire
board of Banesto, the country's fourth biggest bank.

FT  30 DEC 93 / Government to give funds for new selective schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced that it would provide funds for new
selective grammar schools in a radical extension of its policy of
encouraging 'choice and diversity' in education.
This departure from the policy of building comprehensive schools, in force
for about 25 years, was immediately condemned by the Labour party.
Individual promoters, which the government expects will include parents,
religious interest groups and business organisations, will be allowed to
establish new schools, with 85 per cent of the capital building costs met by
the government. The balance must come from the promoters.
This is the same financial requirement that must currently be met by
churches when funding voluntary-aided schools. However, the new schools will
be grant-maintained and funded directly by the government, rather than by
local authorities.
Mr Robin Squire, the schools minister, said: 'Promoters may propose
different types of schools. For example, new grant-maintained schools may be
selective, or have partial selection. They could be single-sex or have a
single-sex stream.'
Existing independent schools which are in financial difficulties will also
be allowed to apply for grant-maintained status.
Methods of selection must be published, and approved by Mr John Patten, the
education secretary. Written academic examinations would be acceptable,
although the department stressed this did not mean a return to the '11-plus'
system. Schools will also be allowed to select pupils on the basis of
aptitude in specialisms, such as technology, music or dance.
Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'Labour has consistently
warned that Mr Patten has a hidden agenda to reintroduce selective
education. Today that agenda has been made explicit.'
She said: 'Selective education favours the very few at the expense of the
vast majority. Children are labelled, often wrongly, with the majority being
classified as failures.'
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said:
'The government is putting the education of the children of this country up
for grabs and it's not good enough. They are asking for money from industry
which it's probably unable to give.'
The measures are outlined in draft guidance for promoters, on which the
government has asked for comments by the end of next month. The draft refers
only to building new schools rather than converting existing schools.
According to the education department, there is a need for new schools in
the south-west, Hampshire and the south-east.
However, school administrators questioned this. The Association of County
Councils, which represents rural local education authorities, said it found
the announcement surprising as 'the secretary of state has been telling us
there are millions of surplus places in existing schools'.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Steinhardt bids Dollars 250m to control America West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Steinhardt, the New York money manager, has offered to pay
Dollars 250m to gain control of America West Airlines, the struggling
Phoenix-based carrier which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for
the past two and a half years.
The investment, which will give Mr Steinhardt 80 per cent of America West,
should be enough to allow the airline to emerge from bankruptcy procedure.
Other investors, however, may make rival offers before February 10, the
deadline set by a Phoenix court for the company to accept bids or propose a
separate plan of its own to leave Chapter 11.
This is not the first time Mr Steinhardt, who runs Steinhardt Management, a
hedge fund with more than Dollars 3bn in assets, has expressed an interest
in owning an airline. In 1989, he was reported to have considered taking
over USAir after building up a 9 per cent stake in the carrier, although no
bid transpired.
His offer for America West fits into his policy of investing in troubled or
bankrupt companies which he believes can be turned around. In recent years
he has put money into the computer group Wang and the consumer products
company Sunbeam-Oster. Steinhardt Management also speculates heavily in
foreign financial markets, including currencies, and in the US equities
market, often through short-selling stocks.
Mr Steinhardt's bid for majority control of America West followed the
withdrawal of a Dollars 150m bid from an investment group led by the
Pritzker family of Chicago and the investment bank Wertheim Schroder. The
Pritzker-Wertheim bid was said to have been pulled because the group could
not reach an agreement with America West's chairman, Mr William Franke. The
Steinhardt bid is believed to be supported by Mr Franke.
Mr Steinhardt has followed in the footsteps of the Pritzker family before.
Earlier this year the Pritzkers abandoned their attempt to acquire the
bankrupt financial services group Integrated Resources, leaving the field
open to the money manager's rival bid.
America West has attracted interest from bidders because of its earnings
performance. In the first three quarters of 1993 it reported profits of
Dollars 26.8m.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Japan company wins Malaysian minerals appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese-controlled chemical company operating in Malaysia has won its
appeal against a court judgment which had found it guilty of emitting
radioactive waste.
The Asian Rare Earth company (ARE), 35 per cent owned by the Mitsubishi
Kasei group, Japan's largest chemical company, had been producing, at its
factory near the town of Ipoh in northern Malaysia, minerals used mostly in
the manufacture of electronics components.
In July last year, the Ipoh High Court accepted evidence of a growing number
of cases of leukaemia, infant deaths and congenital disease in the vicinity
of the factory.
But the Malaysian Supreme Court said the Ipoh trial judge had seriously
misdirected himself in assessing the case put before him. 'Our view is that
the judged had erred in law, in his finding, with regard to factual and
scientific evidence' said the judgment by the Supreme Court. The court also
ordered damages to be assessed in favour of ARE.
A group of local residents who brought the original action against ARE said
it was very disappointed with the new verdict. About 3,000 residents had
come to Kuala Lumpur to await the judgment.
An earlier Supreme Court judgment had allowed ARE to continue its operations
pending the appeal.
The ARE case has aroused interest among environmental groups, both in
Malaysia and Japan, with Japan's multinational companies accused of
exporting dirty industries to countries with less stringent environmental
rules.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Court takes firm line on extorted pay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese court has signalled its disapproval of deals by companies to pay
off racketeers and other extortionists who threaten to disrupt annual
shareholders' meetings.
The Tokyo District Court on Monday meted out suspended sentences of between
five and six months variously to four former officials of Kirin Brewery who
were found to have given Y46m (Dollars 415,000) to sokaiya (extortionists)
this year.
The company denied any links with the pay-offs, but the chairman and two
other senior officials stepped down in July to take responsibility for the
scandal. They have remained with the company as advisers, however.
Many such extortionists claim gang links and commonly take a small stake in
leading companies. They then threaten to ask embarrassing questions at the
annual meeting, unless the company pays them to stay away.
In the past, company executives have lost face at the meetings when
dissatisfied exortionists have asked probing questions, including points
about scandalous information concerning them or about the conduct of the
company.
Some meetings have been stretched to as long as 13 hours as executives faced
query after query.
To limit the impact of the sokaiya, most Japanese companies hold their
shareholders' meeting on the same day but some companies are still targeted
and Kirin seems to have been a victim this year.
Last year, Mr Masatoshi Ito, president of Ito-Yokado, the retail group,
resigned after the arrest of executives from his company who were alleged to
have paid Y27m to gangsters in violation of the Comm-ercial Code, which was
toughened in 1982 to prohibit pay-offs.
Companies have also been known to hire racketeers to monopolise the floor at
shareholders' meetings, so as to prevent investors asking legitimate
questions.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Zhirinovsky party lead in duma confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official results of Russia's December 12 general election, published
yesterday, confirm the strong showing of nationalist and former Communist
parties.
In the lower house of parliament, or state duma the ultra-nationalist
Liberal Democratic party led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky secured 64 seats,
followed by the pro-reform Russia's Choice with 58 seats.
Other results were: Communist party (48), Agrarian party (33), Women of
Russia (23), Yabloko (22), Party of Russian Unity and Concord (19), the
Democratic Party of Russia (14), other parties (33) and those with no party
affiliation gained 130 seats.
In the federal assembly (upper house), the composition was very different as
the election law did not reserve any seats for parties. The overwhelming
majority, 143 out of 171, claimed no party affiliation.
Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, a Communist party member on trial for his role in the
failed Soviet coup of August 1991, was 'almost unanimously' elected chairman
of the temporary co-ordination commission of the new parliament.
The party yesterday announced that about 20 representatives of parties had
selected Mr Lukyanov, who was elected in the general election from his
region of Smolensk in western Russia.
Mr Lukyanov was once chairman of the Soviet congress of people's deputies,
the parliament of the Gorbachev era.
He has been released from jail since being accused of high treason but could
face the death sentence if convicted in the protracted coup trial.

FT  29 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Seasonal sales lift Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cellular telephones group Vodafone produced the second-biggest gain in the
FT-SE 100 stocks, responding to a report that sales of cellular telephones
are currently running at record levels. The shares were additionally helped
by inclusion in a number of stockbrokers' 1994 'best buy' recommendations.
The story had much less impact on the UK's other cellular telephone
companies. BT, which has a majority stake in Cellnet, eased slightly, while
Securicor Group, which controls the minority in Cellnet, managed only a
minor improvement.
Connections to the Vodafone and Cellnet networks have been increasing
rapidly in recent months following low cost tariff initiatives introduced by
both networks.
Vodafone shares finished the run-up to Christmas at an all-time closing high
of 592 1/2 p, a net gain of 10 1/2 p. Turnover reached a highly respectable
1.9m shares. BT, which hit a record 489 1/2 p a week ago, failed to make any
progress, closing a fraction easier at 486p, with the partly-paid 2 1/2 down
at 227p. Securicor 'A' edged up 4 to 892p.
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings was heavily traded as
investors took profits following recent outperformance. The shares fell 16
to 1864p with US sellers leading the price correction.
The shares had risen sharply as a result of a bear squeeze and talk that the
company was considering a bid for Quotron, the US dealing screen subsidiary
of Citicorp. One dealers said 'considering the stock is at a 50 per cent
premium to the market it's surprising that the fall is so slight and the
volume is so high - there has been good two-way business. By the midday
close more than 1m shares had been traded, equivalent to the average
turnover on a full day. A further 1m shares were traded in the form of
options.
Shares with listings in New York were generally weak as US investors,
anticipating a hike in their domestic interest rates, repatriated funds.
Hanson eased a halfpenny to 272 1/2 p, Glaxo slipped a penny to 722p,
Wellcome fell 2 to 651p and Shell lost a penny to 718p. However, volumes
were low.
The English power generator stocks extended their recent powerful
performances, as the market continued to adopt the view that the companies
will be able to avoid a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
A decision by Professor Stephen Littlechild, head of Offer, the industry
regulator, whether to refer the companies to the MMC is expected early in
January.
Recently, Professor Littlechild said a reference could be avoided if the
companies sold some power stations to rivals and gave assurances on
electricity pricing levels.
National Power, the larger of the two groups, raced up 8 to a peak 505p
while PowerGen, which earlier last week agreed to buy Pounds 123m worth of
North Sea assets from Lasmo, put on 5 to a record 567p.
There was no shortage of business in the banks which recovered strongly
after recent profit-taking and switching over the past few sessions.
A Cazenove upgrade and broker buy recommendations drove Standard Chartered
up 10 to 1231p. NatWest was the most heavily traded bank stock and the FT-SE
100's best performer, the shares climbing 15 1/2 , or 2.6 per cent, to 607
1/2 p. There was also heavy activity in the bank's traded options.
Abbey National moved up 8 to a peak 496p after an encouraging forecast on
the UK housing market by the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
Insurance broker CE Heath climbed a further 23 to 413p, responding to a
Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation and speculation that a predator could be
stalking the group.
A series of exceptionally trades in Clyde Petroleum, the soil exploration
group ,at a deep discount, was said to have been the completion of a 'bed
and breakfast,' or tax-related deal. A total of 33m shares traded at 35p
with the stock price rock steady at 47p.

FT  29 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record run maintained on Christmas
Eve - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enthusiasm continued to run high on the London stock market on Christmas
Eve, when the Footsie pushed through 3,400 to yet higher peaks as investors
anticipated a cut in UK base rates early in January. Confidence in economic
recovery was encouraged by reports from Britain's leading retailers that
sales had risen nationally by 13pc-17pc over the past fortnight; record
sales of mobile phones provided the iceing on the Christmas retail cake.
The FT-SE Index closed at a new peak of 3,412.3, a gain of 15.8 on overnight
and only a touch below the new intra-day peak chalked up just before trading
closed.
The final week of pre-Christmas trading saw the Footsie brush off the
expected attempted profit-taking to return to the upward trend as futures
markets indicated the underlyingly bullish investment view. Share prices
have been squeezed higher by a severe shortage of stock as marketmakers have
struggled to meet unexpected demand from the institutions.
Although the extended Christmas equity account does not close until the end
of this month, traders have become wary of leaving dealing positions exposed
over a period when most major stocks markets will be closed for several
days. Some houses still held short positions on Friday morning and were
active buyers of stock.
Also at a new closing peak was the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, with a gain of 10.4
bringing a final figure of 3,773.2. The Mid 250 stocks have proved volatile
but have attracted increasing interest from both professional and private
investors.
Although equity trading volumes were naturally reduced for the half-day
Christmas Eve session, statistics on retail, or customer, business confirmed
that investment in the UK stock market remained above average for
pre-Christmas weeks.
Stock index futures continued to provide a strong lead for share prices. In
pre-futures trading, the equity market was little changed from overnight but
when the March contract opened with a good premium, shares began to move
ahead, and the Footsie showed a gain of about 11 points after half an hour
of official trading.
Morning meetings at the City's leading securities firms were somewhat
lightly attended but most analysts had already put together their lists of
recommended share buys. Traders were warned not to relax their grip of a
market which could well see further activity in the final sessions of the
year.
Fund managers are expected to take any opportunity offered to top up their
portfolios with stocks in those sectors which have led the market forward
since the Budget at the end of November.
Substantial gains in the banking sector again provided the market's
strongest feature as dividend confidence continued to drive the sector
forward. The rest of the financial sector also remained very firm, although
the merchant banks, which have benefited strongly from their active
association with the securities markets, traded more calmly.
Leading store shares, which have shown some caution while awaiting news on
Christmas trading, looked firmer although there was no rush to buy the
shares.
Seaq volume ended at 242.1m shares for the half-session, compared with
885.4m for the full session of the previous day. On Thursday, retail volume
was worth Pounds 1.86bn, at the top end of daily averages for the year.

FT  29 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volumes in derivative markets died away on Friday although futures dealers
were becoming increasingly jittery ahead of the new year which is expected
to see some massive expiries in traded options, writes Peter John.
The contract on the FT-SE 100, which expires in March, opened at 3,417 -
slightly lower than Thursday's close - but was squeezed up to 3,435 as
dealers attempted to unwind positions.
The spread between March and the underlying market widened to 24 points, a
slight premium over its estimated fair value - the figure which takes in the
cost of carrying minus dividends and is currently calculated at about 20
points. Turnover reached 2,129 lots.
The calm was deceptive. Leading life assurers are believed to have taken on
significant hedge positions before the stock market's most recent 300-point
rally. Many of these positions would make money until the stock market hits
3,350 at which point they become worthless.
The hedges, often puts which give the holder the right to sell the market at
a fixed price and time, will expire on the last two trading days of the the
year and that expiry is predicted to lead to volatile trading in the
underlying and derivative markets, including the traded options sector.
Options turnover on Friday was slightly higher than might have been expected
with both Trafalgar House, which is in the process of heavy restructuring
following shock losses recently, and Reuters Holdings seeing more than 1,000
lots changing hands, the equivalent of one million shares. Total options
turnover was 17,367 lots by the early midday close.

FT  29 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: A year in which the tail wagged the
dog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When stock market historians pick their way through the archives, 1993 could
be seen as the year when the tail wagged the stock market dog. While many
analysts are asking themselves if the stock market is seriously overbought,
the Footsie futures have continued to drive it higher.
Next Wednesday, the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)
will publish volume figures for the year end. The data is likely to disclose
a new record. Recent figures for open interest in Footsie futures - the
number of short and long positions in the market  - show that activity has
risen by around 50 per cent this year. The last contract for 1993, which
expired on December 17, continually traded at a hefty premium to the cash
market and its successor, which expires in March, has seen similar pressure.
March began its life some 30 points higher than a stock market already at
record highs and in the first four trading days of being the leading
derivatives contract on the Footsie, it leapt 120 points.
The questions begged by this frenetic activity are who is behind it and why?
Derivative flows are hard to track but it does seem clear that the pressure
is far less home driven than one might expect. Leading institutions such as
the Prudential and Mercury Asset Management might use futures as a quick way
into the market or a hedge against sharp falls. But many small institutions
are like Scottish crofters still tuning into the weather report on steam
radio while the average ten-year-old is quoting Michael Fish soundbites.
There is a consensus that about 50 per cent of activity in futures comes
from US investors. This is partly because they are far more comfortable with
the technicalities of derivatives instruments than their UK counterparts.
Also, large US funds need to move cash quickly and futures can provide a far
more efficient way of doing this. This has caused an undercurrent of concern
that when the US Federal Reserve begins to lift rates again the improved
returns will quickly lead to suck-back of dollars that will drain many
European markets.
However, there is a competing argument that improved liquidity has
fundamentally increased the level of global investment and that, as
disposable incomes rise, there will be more money rather than less invested
in the mature economies.

FT  29 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reaches yet another
record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Although US stock markets saw early selling yesterday, the losses were
relatively limited and share prices rebounded to end the day marginally
higher in record territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.83 at 3,793.76, a
new record close. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 0.40
at 470.94, another all-time high, while the American Stock Exchange
composite index finished 2.84 higher at 470.00 and the Nasdaq composite up
3.51 at 764.57. Trading volume on the NYSE was 202m shares. Sentiment
remained positive as investors headed into the new year in an upbeat mood.
Trading, however, was subdued because many investors were away for an
extended holiday. Yesterday's early selling was to be expected, given the
extent of the market's gains the previous day.
On Monday, the Dow jumped 35.21 to a record high of 3,792.93, while the S &amp;
P 500 put on 3.16 at 470.54, also a record high. The Amex composite firmed
1.84 to 467.16 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.36 to end at 761.06. Trading
volume on Monday was 171m shares.
US share prices have been pushing ahead to new peaks because of several
factors. They include fresh evidence of the strengthening economy, strong
overseas markets, and signs that the Federal Reserve is not yet ready to
raise interest rates. Yesterday, investors received good news from the
Conference Board, which reported that its closely-followed index of consumer
confidence jumped to 80.2 in December, up from 71.9 in November. Sentiment
was also buoyed by fresh declines in commodity prices, including oil.
Among individual stocks, semiconductor issues were in demand on the news
that the Clinton administration had called for emergency talks on
semiconductor trade with Japan in the wake of figures showing a decline in
foreign companies' share of the Japanese semiconductor market. Motorola,
which was up more than Dollars 1 at one stage, rose Dollars 1/4 to Dollars
91 5/8 , Texas Instruments firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 63 1/8 , and
Intel, which is traded on the Nasdaq market, added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars
64.
Cyclical stocks were in mixed form. Allied-Signal fell Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 79 5/8 and International Paper eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 67 7/8
on profit-taking, but Caterpillar firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 90 1/4 and
Bethlehem Steel put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 19. Auto stocks remained in
good demand as investors bet that sales of new cars and trucks would stay
healthy throughout early 1994. Chrysler rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 ,
Ford put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 64 3/4 and General Motors firmed Dollars
 3/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, QVC Network fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 amid
reports that if it succeeds with its Dollars 10bn bid for Paramount
Communications it will be forced to take billions of dollars in goodwill
charges for the next 20 to 40 years.
Canada
TORONTO stocks were sharply higher in quiet trading. The TSE-300 composite
index rose 42.46 points, or 1.0 per cent, to 4,288.85. Advances led declines
461 to 230, volume of 35.49m shares was below Thursday's 59.9m and trading
value was CDollars 313.4m compared with CDollars 523.4m.
The market was closed last Friday and yesterday for the Christmas holiday.

FT  29 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong surges 4.8% in
record setting region

Roundup
Pacific Rim markets remained in buoyant mood after Monday's sparkling
performances which brought records in Bankok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila,
Singapore, and Taiwan. A further clutch of records were set yesterday as
bull runs were extended in some markets and others returned after an
extended weekend holiday, determined to catch up. Australia and New Zealand
were closed.
HONG KONG surged 4.8 per cent to a record close, the Hang Seng index making
its biggest one-day jump ever as foreign funds poured into the market after
the holiday.
The index finished 530.38 higher at 11,570.22. The previous largest single
day rise was the 394.40 advance seen on December 16. Preliminary turnover
was a robust HKDollars 9.61bn against the final HKDollars 4.75bn for
Friday's half-day session.
Gains were across the board but property counters led on hopes of strong
profits due to a relaxation of building controls in the Kowloon district and
record land prices.
SINGAPORE's bull run continued, pushing the Straits Times Industrials index
to up 13.94 to a new closing high of 2,392.37, in spite of profit-taking
after Monday's trade, which also set a record.
Intra-day losses were erased when selling was well absorbed by investors
still hopeful of making gains ahead of the new year, brokers said.
BANGKOK extended its record breaking rally in very heavy turnover, closing
sharply higher for the sixth straight session. The SET Index added 44.57 or
2.8 per cent to 1,652.69, taking the cumulative advance to 10.4 per cent
over the past week.
KARACHI broke into record territory at the close amid a sense of optimism on
strong buying from overseas. The KSE 100-share price index rose 33.88 to
2,100.60.
TAIWAN closed at a 29-month high as financials surged, although most other
sectors fell on profit-taking after the recent bull run. The weighted index,
which rose 85 points at one stage, finished 10.07 higher at 5,501.75, in
heavy turnover of TDollars 85.2bn.
KUALA LUMPUR closed higher but off the day's best after late profit-taking
trimmed a strong early advance. Active institutional and foreign buying
pushed the composite index to a record intra-day high of 1,225.25 before
closing at 1,223.05, up 17.77.
MANILA took a rollercoaster ride, with prices surging at the opening and
falling sharply on profit-taking before bouncing back at the close. The
composite index fell 4.97 from Monday's record, to 3,165.65.
SEOUL ended easier on the last day of 1993 trading after heavy selling by
the Korea Securities Market Stabilisation Fund in an attempt to cool the
market. The composite index fell 7.70 to 866.18.
Tokyo
After an aggregate loss of 3.6 per cent on Friday and Monday, Japanese
equities recovered half of those losses yesterday, writes Wayne Lionel
Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 311.33 to 17,131.21 in light trading, but on on
steady buying from investment trusts and bargain hunters. On Monday, the
225-average declined by 321.23 to 16,819.88, after shedding 304.63 to
17,141.11 on Friday; it fluctuated between 16,853.99 and 17,147.61
yesterday.
The Topix Index of all first section issues ended 19.81, or 1.4 per cent
higher at 1,427.19. Turnover was estimated at 200m shares compared with 190m
on Monday and 206m on Friday. Advances led declines by 658 to 292 with 172
unchanged. Japanese brokers said that market sentiment remains bearish in
spite of the session's gains, due to uncertainty about the timing of an
economic stimulus package and any political reform by the administration of
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister. Government officials agreed that
an income tax cut is of primary importance, but the announcement was already
factored into the market.
According to Mr Yuichi Matsushita, senior market strategist at Nikko
Securities, hopes of an year-end rally during the next two trading sessions
are likely to be disappointed. Investors are now cautious about the first
quarter of 1994, in the absence of any fresh incentives  - and with the
weakness in the overall economy illustrated by the recent 6.9 per cent
year-to-year decline in the nation's retail sales for a 18th consecutive
monthly drop.
Chart analysts expect the Nikkei average to rise above last year's close of
16,924.95, but to stay within a narrow range between 17,000 to 17,300 with
foreign investors on holiday and most domestic market participants on the
sidelines.
Small-lot buys from investment trusts lifted major steelmakers. Nippon Steel
gained Y6 at Y303, Kawasaki Steel Y8 at Y309, NKK Y7 at Y237 and Sumitomo
Metal Industries Y10 at Y260. The heavy electronic sector benefited from the
day's rally. Toshiba advanced Y18 at Y685, while Hitachi moved Y17 higher at
Y810.
Profit-taking cut the gains of Mazda Motors. Investors dumped shares after
buying on Monday, on the news that the Japanese carmaker and the US-based
Ford Motor will strengthen their ties. Mazda fell Y15 to Y383.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 220.05 higher at 18,964.39, in volume of 31m
shares.

FT  29 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses take profits in
post-holiday consolidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a level day on Friday and a lot of excitement on Monday as the
year-end rally appeared to resume, bourses fell on a round of profit-taking,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's DAX index hit an high of 2,253.98 on Monday, up 31.14, peaked at
2,284.56 early yesterday and closed 11.16 lower at 2,242.82, nearly a
percentage point higher than when the holiday began.
Turnover rose from DM8.95bn to DM10.45bn. One consistent feature of both
days was the recovery in Metallgesellschaft, up DM17.30 on Monday, and
another DM13.80 to DM291 yesterday for a two-day gain of 11.9 per cent on
hopes that its new chairman, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, will be able to restructure
it effectively.
Sectors which saw continued gains included chemicals where BASF, up DM1 to
DM301.80, and Hoechst, DM1.70 better at DM316.50, both hit new 1993 highs;
and carmakers, where BMW and Daimler rose DM1 to DM717, and DM2 to DM822.50.
BMW said yesterday that it would make a profit in 1993, and all four posted
gains of more than 2 per cent on Monday.
PARIS fell back, consolidating after setting its third consecutive high on
Monday. The CAC-40 index ended 11.91 lower at 2,264.64 in turnover of
FFr3.5bn.
Insurers, actually or relatively weak on Monday, suffered further from fears
of the impact on their results of severe flooding in northern and eastern
France. UAP lost FFr16 at FFr640, AGF FFr11 at FFr688 and GAN FFr19 at
FFr528.
Euro Disney dropped another FFr1.35 to FFr29.05 after losing FFr2.80 on
Monday, for a two-day drop of 12.5 per cent. Monday's slide reflected a
report that banks were being offered 55 per cent of face value for Euro
Disney debt. Yesterday, it was confirmed that minority shareholders had
asked the French COB to look into changes in the company's accounting
methods.
MADRID lost Monday's gains and more, the general index closing 4.37 lower at
319.34. Banks were especially weak, with attention fixed on Banesto,
suspended by the National Securities Market Commission at lunchtime, having
lost Pta140 pesetas to Pta1,995 amid rumours that the Bank of Spain was
looking into its accounts. The central bank's move to replace the board with
a provisional administration, came after the market had closed.
ZURICH's profit-taking brought to an end a rally over the previous six
sessions, which saw a succession of record closes. The SMI index fell 41.7
or 1.4 per cent to 2,930.9. CS Holding, trading for the first time since the
five for one share split, shed SFr28 or 3.2 per cent to SFr728.
Other recent high-flyers suffered from profit-taking: Ciba-Geigy bearers
eased SFr15 to SFr900. Swiss Re, still under pressure after its recent share
split, closed SFr12 lower at SFr737.
MILAN finished ahead but below session highs, as weakness elsewhere brought
profit-takers in late. The Comit index added 3.74 to 617.93 as turnover
picked up from Monday's L230bn, little more than a third of the daily
average over the last month.
The market balanced anxiety
over potential delays in calling the general election against hopes of lower
interest rates in coming weeks and the usual new year influx of retail
demand. Montedison saw speculative interest from traders seeking to cash in
on intra-day fluctuations, closing L16.40 lower at L882.60, after a day's
high of L907.00.
Banks found renewed demand: BCI added L55 to L5,236 in volume of 3.5m shares
while Credito Italiano rose L19 to L2,295 in 6.7m.
AMSTERDAM was lower as option-related business and selling by several German
investment funds pulled prices back from Monday's record highs. The CBS
Tendency index shed 1.70 to 148.10.
Publishers, recently outperformers, were hit hardest. Wolters Kluwer sagged
Fl 4.00 to Fl 124.50 in fair volume as CLN Oyens &amp; Van Eeghen downgraded the
share from a buy to a hold. VNU shed Fl 1.60 to Fl 173.90 and Elsevier lost
Fl 2.70 to Fl 182.20.
ABN-Amro eased 20 cents to Fl 70.70 amid market rumours that a US investor
was about to sell 2m of the bank's shares.
COPENHAGEN's KFX index added 1.34 or 1.3 per cent to 106.65 as strong demand
emerged in a market with a dearth of sellers. Novo Nordisk put on DKr12 to
DKr662, with Sophus Berendsen B DKr10 up at DKr534.
ATHENS jumped in heavy, across-the-board trading as continued strength in
building stocks led shares higher. The general index closed 25.17 or 2.8 per
cent higher 935.17 in turnover of about Dr7.2bn, almost twice last week's
daily average.
BRUSSELS, closed on Monday, caught up with the Bel-20 index closing 11.13
higher at a new high of 1.473.53, in turnover of BFr1.66bn after a cut its
central bank rate by 15 basis points to 7.25 per cent.
WARSAW reflected selling pressure almost as dramatically as the buying which
it has soared on this year, the WIG index falling by 1,057, or 8.2 per cent
from its record high to 11,761 in fairly average turnover of 1,350bn zlotys.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Muted holiday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continued closure of London's financial markets yesterday made for quiet
currency trading in other centres in spite of better than expected US
consumer confidence data and a surprise cut in Belgium's central rate for
money market lending, writes Peter Norman.
Traders in Europe said that activity was unlikely to revive until after the
new year even though London operators return to the fray today. Although
exchange rates moved in narrow ranges yesterday, there was a considerable
amount of information for the market to digest.
The dollar yesterday was a good example of a currency that failed to respond
to news. The Conference Board's US consumer confidence index jumped to 80.10
in December from a revised 71.9 in November and was well above market's
expectations of an index reading around 73.
But the dollar did little more than drift in thin trading, to close at
DM1.7015 in Frankfurt, barely changed from DM1.7017 at the opening and
Monday's New York close of DM1.701. The US currency traded in a half pfennig
range throughout yesterday's European session to end little changed from the
DM1.695 close in London on Christmas Eve.
Today sees the announcement of US leading indicators for November while US
weekly jobless data will be released tomorrow. However, so long as many
banks remain shut with their trading positions squared until the new year,
it is difficult to foresee any revival of trading between the dollar and
D-mark this week.
German based traders are in any case waiting to see if their expectations of
a Bundesbank rate cut are fulfilled early in the new year. The Bundesbank's
first council meeting is scheduled for January 6. Yesterday Mr Otmar Issing,
one of the anti-inflation hawks on the Bundesbank board, said considerable
progress would be made in the fight against inflation next year. He added
that the bank would continue to assess room for rate cuts but had set no
date for an easing.
The D-mark was mixed against other continental currencies yesterday. It was
steady at FFr3.4073 against FFr 3.408 in late Monday trading. However, by
last night the French currency had strengthened noticeably from the FFr3.412
recorded in London on Christmas Eve. The Italian lira eased against the
D-Mark to L988.75 from Monday's L986.25 and London's pre-Christmas L983.1 on
renewed political uncertainty in Italy.
The Bundesbank's money market operations yesterday gave no clue to interest
rate intentions. It called for tenders on its latest round of 14-day
securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 6 per cent to replace
some DM79.5bn in 6 per cent repos which expire today.
The new tranche of repos expires on January 12 and will be the fourth
consecutive operation of its kind at which the rate has been fixed at 6 per
cent. The amount accepted will be announced today, when payment also will be
due.
By contrast, the Belgian National Bank surprised the markets by cutting its
key central rate for money market lending by 0.15 percentage points to 7.25
per cent yesterday. It also cut its regular overnight interest rate by 0.15
points to 8.95 per cent while leaving its discount rate unchanged at 5.25
per cent and its emergency rate for overnight lending at 11.50 per cent.
The Belgian National Bank declined to coment on the rate cuts. But they
clearly did the Belgian franc no harm. It closed marginally stronger against
the D-mark at BFr20.82 compared with BFr20.8295 late Monday and BFr20.84 in
London on December 24.
Sterling was supported in the absence of London trading by bullish remarks
about the UK recovery from Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury.
The pound was firm in late European dealings at DM2.5645 against Monday's
DM2.5580 and DM 2.545 in London last Friday.
Against the dollar, sterling traded at Dollars 1.5085 in late European
activity compared with Dollars 1.504 on Monday and Dollars 1.502 in
pre-holiday London dealings.
Earlier in Tokyo, the yen maintained a fragile stability. It closed against
the dollar at Y111.45, slightly weaker than Y111.40 of late Monday in New
York and the Y111.25 yen in Tokyo on Monday. Yesterday in New York lunchtime
trading it was quoted at around Y111.35.
A moderate recovery of Tokyo stock prices hindered aggressive selling of the
yen in Japan yesterday. Also operators were reported to be 'very nervous
about the wall of Y112,' according to one dealer at a Japanese credit bank.
'At present Y112 is a thick psychological barrier,' he said.
Dealers said that the majority in the market predict a rise in the dollar at
the beginning of January. However, the real intentions of the US regarding
the yen's exchange rate remain uncertain, keeping traders uneasy.
Aggressive dollar buying has been discouraged by last week's comments by Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, who said the US administration has
been disappointed with the Japanese government's efforts towards stimulating
domestic demand.
Moreover, complaints late on Monday from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, about a drop in the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor
market in the third quarter of this year fueled concerns that the US might
place upward pressure on the yen.
The Japanese finance ministry announced yesterday that Japan's current
account surplus for November fell 21 per cent from the year-earlier month to
Dollars 8.21bn. Although the drop was sharper than expected, it failed to
trigger any reaction in foreign exchange trading.
Because of the extended UK holiday, the tables on this page containing data
from London carry information from December 24. Data relating to US and
continental European markets reflect yesterday's trading conditions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week we reported already that pepper prices had started to improve.
During this week the upward trend continued both for white and black pepper.
A recent survey in the far east reveals that white pepper stocks in
Indonesia are much too low to cover the requirements for the next 7/8 months
to come before the new crop will be available. It is therefore not so
surprising that prices recovered from Dollars 2400 cif, a fortnight ago to
about Dollars 3000 cif, today. A slight recovery in the
demand(shortcovering) triggered the market already. Since not much material
from other sources may be expected the supply position will remain very
tight. Black pepper prices also recovered quickly from their lows (Dollars
1250 cif) to about Dollars 1600 cif,(today) all origins tended much firmer
from the moment some demand came in from non traditional consuming markets.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Focus shifts to Germany in thin trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most continental European bond markets drifted lower yesterday, but, with
London closed and many continental European market participants on holiday,
trading was extremely thin.
German bond prices dropped slightly, as dealers tried to hedge the new
30-year German government bond, of which DM3bn was allotted to the
traditional bank consortium yesterday.
More 30-year bonds will be auctioned today. Dealers believe the total amount
of 30-year bonds will be DM10bn. The Bundesbank is expected to hold back a
portion of bonds for market operations.
Dealers said the terms of the bond, which matures on January 4, 2024, were
in line with expectations. The coupon was set at 6.25 per cent and the price
at 100.40. The bonds were quoted at 99.50 in the grey market, according to
dealers.
'We don't expect to have any problems selling the paper, but it will go to
foreign buyers, and they are not around at the moment,' said one trader.
French bond prices edged lower at the long-end, in sympathy with the German
market, but dealers said thin trading was confined to a 20 basis point
range.
US bond prices eased slightly at the long end of the maturity range in quiet
trading yesterday after news of strong consumer confidence data. The
declines followed the moderate losses the market posted on Monday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/32 at 100
5/32 to yield 6.233 per cent. The two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 1/8,
yielding 4.168 per cent.
Although business was quiet with many participants away on holiday, there
was some selling early on after the Conference Board announced that its
index of consumer confidence rose to 80.2 in December, up from 71.9 in
November.
Dealers said that the long end of the market would probably have fallen
further but for the positive effect on sentiment of fresh declines in
commodity prices, including another large drop in the oil price.

FT  29 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Italian sector is expected to
remain leader of the pack - European bonds rallied strongly in 1993 while
the US caught the jitters after a good start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most investors, 1993 was the year of the European bond bonanza, with
fixed-income markets fuelled by falling interest rates, slowing inflation
and faltering economies. Next year is likely to bring more of the same as
Europe's economies continue to limp along, monetary policies remain
accommodating and fiscal tightening limits supply.
However, 1994 promises to be a more difficult year as the European bond
rally loses steam in the second half and markets re-focus on political risk,
budget deficits and economic recovery.
Moreover, the low yields prevailing in most markets will make double-digit
performance next year hard to attain. Few markets still offer yields above 6
per cent and 'besides the lower-running yield, this also means lower capital
gains potential, and at the same time higher risks,' says Mr Reiner Back,
head of fixed-income strategy at DB Research in Frankfurt.
On a global comparison, last year's best-performing market was Italy, which
rose 31.67 per cent in local currency terms, according to data compiled by
JP Morgan. That was followed by Spain, up 30.93 per cent, and Denmark with a
21.24 per cent rise. The US and Japan provided the poorest returns, yielding
10.30 per cent and 13.36 per cent, respectively.
European bonds are expected to outperform other markets again next year,
lifted by central banks' continued easing of interest rates. Ms Alison
Cottrell, European economist at Midland Global Markets, expects European
short-term rates to fall another 250 basis points on average by the end of
1994, with the German discount rate - currently at 5.75 per cent - reaching
4 per cent by the summer and 3.5 per cent by year-end.
That should put German bond yields, at historical lows in real terms, under
further downward pressure from a weak economy, decelerating inflation and a
tighter fiscal stance. The 10-year benchmark bund yield, at around 5.65 per
cent, is widely expected to drop below 5.5 per cent, with some economists
going as low as 5.2 per cent.
One risk factor in Germany is the country's election marathon, with 19 polls
slated for the year. Given the weakness of the economy and soaring
unemployment, political shocks caused by extreme voting patterns could be
possible.
According to Ms Cottrell, the risk period for bunds is likely to be not so
much the October federal elections as the period between the Lower Saxony
regional elections on March 13 and the European elections on June 12. 'A
large protest vote may prove more unsettling for the markets than the
October election,' she notes.
French bonds should do well, although they may be prone to political jitters
around the European parliament elections and in the run-up to the 1995
presidential elections. However, the country's low and falling inflation
rate, torpid economy and record unemployment are expected to promote sharp
rate cuts, helped by the continuing strength of the French franc.
The UK bond market put on a dazzling performance this year, posting an
annual return of 20.88 per cent. Gilts rallied sharply after the November 30
budget, helped by favourable inflation developments which saw the retail
price index fall to a 26-year low in November.
The low-inflation, slow-growth scenario is expected to underpin gilts early
next year, bolstered by prospects for some more rate cuts by the Bank of
England. Most observers expect at least another  1/2 -point off the 5.5 per
cent base rate, with an increasing number of analysts calling for 4 per cent
base rates by year-end.
'The highest returns are likely during the first half of 1994 reflecting the
positive combination of lower short-term rates and a continuing rally in
overseas bond markets,' predicts Mr David Walton, economist at Goldman
Sachs. He expects the 10-year gilt yield to drop below 6 per cent in the
next few months, from about 6.20 per cent at present.
However, he warns that some of these gains might evaporate in the second
half, with the yield curve steepening as the international environment
becomes less supportive and investors begin to worry about a rise in UK
inflation.
Meanwhile, Europe's high-yielders remain everybody's favourite, with Italy
expected to lead the pack.
'In this low-yield environment, the quest for good returns will push
investors into the high-yielders which still offer potential for yield
convergence towards the hard core,' said Mr Back at DB Research. While
Italy's national elections - likely to be held in spring - will keep the
country's currency and bond market volatile, economic fundamentals and the
prospect of further rate cuts will buoy Italian bonds, he says.
Ms Ros Lifton, European economist at Nomura Research Institute, expects the
Italian bond market to outperform all others in the next six months and sees
10-year yields falling some 100 basis points by mid-1994 from the current
8.41 per cent. Italy's fundamentals are promising, with inflation set to
drop below 4 per cent and the fiscal outlook improving after the successful
passage of the 1994 budget.
Spanish bond yields are expected to decline further, although they are
likely to lag behind Italy. The minority socialist government is having
trouble implementing labour market reforms, and with a general strike
planned for January, the peseta is likely to be plagued by political
tensions. Spanish fundamentals - rising inflation and an overshooting budget
deficit - do not bode well for aggressive cuts in interest rates, which are
needed to revive the economy and reduce record unemployment.
Meanwhile, a tighter policy stance by the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to
have much impact on European bonds. 'The dislocation of US and European
business cycles suggests a fairly muted link between US and European
yields,' says Ms Cottrell.
Moreover, with worldwide economic activity expected to remain subdued and
oil prices seen as remaining stable, commodities prices are unlikely to fuel
inflation pressures.

FT  29 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Inflation remains the primary
factor - European bonds rallied strongly in 1993 while the US caught the
jitters after a good start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If short-term memory is stronger than long-term memory, 1993 in the US bond
market may be remembered more for the jitters that sent prices reeling in
the final 10 weeks of the year, than for the proceeding 9 1/2 -month rally
that pushed long-term interest rates to the lowest levels in a generation.
This would be something of a shame, because for most of this year the bond
market has enjoyed a remarkable run. In the first few days of 1993,
long-term yields were trading close to 7.5 per cent. By mid-October, yields
had plunged to 5.78 per cent, a record low in the modern era.
The primary forces behind the bond market's rally - a rally which helped
spur stock prices to record highs in 1993 - were low inflation and an
economic recovery that was weak compared to previous post-recessionary
periods.
Worldwide disinflationary forces, including declining oil and other
commodity prices and the gradual dismantling of various barriers to free
trade, combined with vigorous price competition in the US retail and
services sectors, kept inflation throughout the year in a range between 2.5
per cent and 3 per cent.
A stuttering economy, at least in the first half of the year, was also
partly responsible for the lack of inflationary pressures.
In particular, concern about how President Clinton's first budget (which was
designed to shrink the deficit by raising taxes and cutting federal
spending) would affect the economy acted as a restraint on corporate and
consumer spending.
The Federal Reserve's monetary policy was another factor pushing bond yields
lower.
Although interest rates remained unchanged throughout 1993 - the prime rate
and discount rate started and ended the year at 6 per cent and 3 per cent
respectively - the lack of strong economic growth persuaded the Fed to keep
policy on hold for the year.
Meanwhile, low short-term rates forced investors to switch billions of
dollars out of bank certificates of deposit and money market funds, which
were returning a meagre 2 per cent to 3 per cent, and into assets with
higher yields. For conservative investors uncomfortable with the risk
inherent in buying equities, bonds became the natural refuge.
Finally, technical considerations played a role in the rally, when the
government reduced the number of bond auctions from four to three per year,
and increased the size of short- and medium-term debt issues accordingly.
The move was designed to cut the cost of government financing by shortening
the maturity of the federal debt. The result was a shortage of 30-year
bonds, which served to drive prices higher in an already buoyant market.
However, the rally ran out of steam in mid-October. Within two weeks, the
30-year bond yield had jumped almost 50 basis points to more than 6.2 per
cent. Another fortnight later, yields were flirting with 6.4 per cent, and
the smell of panic was in the air. The spark for the sell-off was provided
by stronger-than-expected economic reports.
Although the prices data in the final months of the year did not suggest
inflation had revived along with the quickening pace of economic activity,
investors were looking toward 1994, and a grim future of surging economic
growth, rising prices, and a tightening of monetary policy. This is the
gloomy scenario for the bond market.
However, not everyone paints such a bleak picture for next year.
While economic growth is expected to come in at over 4 per cent for the
final quarter of 1993, some economists see a slowing down in growth in the
first half of 1994 as the tax increases in President Clinton's first budget
begin to take their toll on spending and investment.
The optimists expect inflation to remain subdued because of the structural
disinflationary forces in the global economy. And they are confident that
the Fed will not overreact to the late-1993 growth surge by pushing interest
rates sharply higher in early 1994. The expected replacement in January of
Mr Wayne Angell, an important Fed governor and the central bank's biggest
inflation hawk, with the more accommodating and growth-oriented Ms Alice
Rivlin, currently number two at the Office of Management and Budget, lends
support to that view.
A quick glance at Wall Street's 1994 bond market forecasts finds that the
optimists represent the majority. Consequently, the consensus among analysts
is that bond prices will rally early next year, and by enough to push
long-term yields down below 6 per cent once more. Further out in 1994,
however, growth rates are expected to pick up, which could mean that the
first half rally will be short-lived.

FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: State near completion of Koor
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's government is to sell its remaining shares in Koor Industries -
Israel's largest trade and industrial conglomerate which is spearheading
commercial links with Arab companies in the wake of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace accord.
The move follows the announcement that Koor and Bank Leumi, Israel's second
largest banking group, have signed separate deals with Morrocan companies to
set up investment and banking companies in the first concrete signs of a
thawing of Arab-Jewish commercial relations.
Koor said it was establishing a Dollars 60m joint venture company to make
investments in the occupied territories with Moroccan and Palestinian
partners. Bank Leumi said it had signed an agreement last week in Casablanca
to set up a new commercial bank to operate in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, soon to come under Palestinian self-rule.
Together the projects mark an important breakthrough for Israel in
developing trade and business ties with Arab partners after years when
Israel was isolated by the Arab economic boycott which, although loosened
recently, still remains in force.
The opening of trade ties with Morocco also follows indications that King
Hassan is preparing to broaden his country's economic co-operation with
Israel in a package which includes an air agreement between El Al and Royal
Moroc; direct telephone and mail links; and the exchange of business
delegations.
The government said next Thursday it would sell the last tranche of the 10.5
per cent of Koor's equity it acquired in 1989 as part of its role in saving
the company from a financial crisis. The government has been selling off its
stake over the past six months and now has only 1.9 per cent of the company
to sell in an offering expected to fetch at least Dollars 27m.
The sale will boost Koor's plans to exploit new business opportunities in
the Middle East and help increase annual sales which last year reached
Dollars 2.65bn.

Arthur Andersen has become the world's largest accountancy firm by fee
income, according the International Accounting Bulletin.
The firm grew by 7.9 per cent to just over Dollars 6bn in the year to
August, overtaking by Dollars 17m KPMG Peat Marwick, which has been the
largest network since it was formed by the merger of two firms in 1987.
Just two of the largest 14 international firms and networks reported any
declines: KPMG, which was down 1.6 per cent to Dollars 6bn in the year to
September 30, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, down 2.4 per cent to Dollars 5.2bn in
the year to September 30.
Andersen reported the largest growth, more than half of which came from
Andersen Consulting, the computer consultancy provider.
It is the only true single worldwide firm, while the others are looser
networks and affiliations of national firms.
Ernst &amp; Young reported growth of 2.4 per cent to Dollars 5.8bn in the year
to September, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu rose 4.2 per cent to Dollars 5bn and
Price Waterhouse 3.4 per cent to Dollars 3.9bn.

FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Banesto: walking on a razor's
edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare for a bank to lose its entire board less than four months after
raising nearly Dollars 700m from the international financial community.
It is rarer still for such an upset to happen to an institution publicly
embraced by JP Morgan, the bank most admired by other bankers.
Yet that is what happened yesterday to Banesto, Spain's fourth-largest bank.
Its board was replaced at the orders of the Bank of Spain, because, said the
central bank, Banesto needed restructuring on a scale which required 'the
support of the entire banking system'. If that implies serious, longstanding
problems in Banesto's loan portfolio, it was a concern brushed aside by the
investors who put up Dollars 670m for Banesto's rights issue this summer.
Individual Spanish investors pinned their faith to Mr Mario Conde, the
bank's youthful chairman, who was demonstrating his faith in the bank he had
run since 1987 with a personal purchase of shares worth Pta6.4bn (Dollars
47.4m).
Institutional investors round the world were comforted by the presence of JP
Morgan as adviser to the bank and co-investor. Banesto was the first target
of the Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, a portfolio set up by Morgan to invest in
undervalued banks.
Corsair put Dollars 175m into Banesto. Though Morgan was providing only
Dollars 17.5m of that, it was publicly setting the seal of respectability on
the Spanish bank. 'We must get it right because we are investing our
reputation,' said Mr Roberto Mendoza, a Morgan vice-chairman. 'That is the
biggest kind of risk we can take.'
Mr Conde had no illusions about the value of Morgan's name. 'Would there
have been a capital issue without JP Morgan? The answer is no,' he said. But
the Morgan name was not enough to see the capital-raising plan through to
completion. Last week, Banesto cancelled the final stage of its
capital-raising exercise, a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue.
The cancellation was accompanied by the resignation from JP Morgan of Ms
Violy de Harper, managing director of the US bank's corporate advisory arm,
who masterminded the deal with the Corsair fund.
In retrospect, Banesto has been walking on the razor's edge ever since Mr
Conde's plan to sell shares in the bank's industrial empire, Corporacion
Banesto, fell foul of the market slump that accompanied the Gulf war in
1990.
Banesto needed the capital to shore up its balance sheet. The sale would
have met the regulator's new rule requiring Spanish banks hold down the
proportion of industrial assets in their shareholders funds.
With the Corporacion Banesto sale postponed, Banesto was reduced to finding
individual buyers for its industrial assets. These include stakes in
Acerinox, Spain's leading stainless steel producer; Union Carburos, an
industrial gases group; Tudor, Europe's third-ranked battery producer;
Agroman, the big domestic building group and Asturiana de Zinc, a mining
business.
With most of these businesses weakened by recession, successful sales have
been hard to find, though shares in Acerinox were successfully placed last
autumn.
Banesto solved its balance sheet weaknesses with this summer's rights issue.
However, finding new capital has not been enough to satisfy the Bank of
Spain. JP Morgan must now be hoping that Banesto's new management finds
nothing that undermines its judgment earlier this year.
In the summer, Mr Mendoza summed up his perception of the chance Morgan was
taking with Banesto. 'My own sense is that this is very low risk, although
you can argue as to how good the returns will be.'

FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Text of Bank of Spain statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is an unofficial translation of a statement issued by the Bank
of Spain:
Note to central banks and foreign supervisory authorities.
The Bank of Spain has agreed, as of today's date, the substitution of
administrative organs of the Banco Espanol de Credito in accordance with the
Third Title of Law 26/1988, July 29, on Discipline and Intervention by the
Credit Bodies.
Consequently, by this accord, effective immediately, Banco Espanol de
Credito's administrative council is wound up and the Entity (Banesto)
remains under the supervision of the provisional new administrative body
named by the Bank of Spain, and composed of the following persons:
Alfredo Saenz Abad, who will act as president; Ildefonso Ayala Garcia;
Marcial Portela Alvarez; Epifanio Ridraejo Briueva; Matias Rodriguez
Inciarte.
The aforementioned provisional administrative body remains under the direct
supervision of the Bank of Spain, through having been designated to exercise
the public faculties that the law confers upon it.
Banesto's situation has forced the adoption of restructuring measures that
could not be taken by the Entity in isolation by itself and which require,
on the contrary, the support of the whole banking system, in its case of the
Guarantee Fund for Deposits in Banking Establishments.
Those reasons have determined the composition of the new governing body,
which will always act in the best and exclusive interest of the depositors
and shareholders of Banesto. Its mission is to maintain the Entity's normal
functioning, and to set up a restructuring programme in collaboration with
the Bank of Spain, and, in particular, to ensure the stability and future of
the entity, maintaining at all times the full confidence of the depositors
and the financial markets.
In this way the Bank of Spain guarantees the liquidity of the institutions
in local and foreign markets, adopting all measures necessary to that end. -
Madrid, December 28 1993

FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Cavalier who infuriated the
establishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mario Conde is only 45, yet he has infuriated Spain's financial
establishment more often than any septuagenarian, writes Our Financial
Staff.
He bounded on to the financial stage in 1987 when he and a friend sold their
bulk chemicals producer to Montedison for Pta65bn (Dollars 481m). With the
proceeds they bought their way on to the Banesto board, and he became
president within days.
He has enlarged the bank at a breakneck pace; become embroiled in a wrangle
with los Albertos, two other youthful entrepreneurs, which ended in their
public humiliation; helped Mr Rupert Murdoch stage a boardroom coup at a
television station; provoked the hostility of BP; and been cited as a future
conservative prime minister.
The son of a Galician customs official, he studied law at the Jesuit
University of Duesto near Bilbao, achieving one of the three highest marks
in national law exams.
He admits that when he took control at Banesto he did not tell shareholders
how bad it was. If he had come clean, he said recently, 'what would have
been their reaction? They would have left the bank'.
This cavalier approach to shareholders partly explains Mr Conde's many
enemies. Just as important is his enthusiasm for busting Spanish banking's
interest rate cartel. With his departure, the Spanish financial
establishment will sleep more easily.

FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Two Japanese chemical groups to
merge next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two Japanese chemical companies that belong to the Mitsubishi group of
companies plan to merge their operations and create Japan's largest chemical
company.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the largest domestic petrochemical company in
which Shell Petroleum has a 12.6 per cent stake and Shell Japan a 5.7 per
cent stake, and Mitsubishi Kasei, the country's biggest all-round chemical
manufacturer, plan to merge next October on an equal basis.
The new company, Mitsubishi Chemical, will have consolidated profits of more
than Y1,000bn (Dollars 9.35bn) and a combined share of more than 15 per cent
of the domestic ethylene market.
The decision, aimed at increasing international competitiveness, comes in
the midst of one of the most difficult times for Japan's petrochemical
sector and is expected to encourage further consolidation in the industry.
The country's chemical industry has not only suffered a prolonged business
slump in the domestic market, but is also facing growing competition
overseas.
Overcapacity has plagued the industry since the early 1980s and there have
been rumours of consolidation for the past 10 years, according to Mr John
Chanoki, analyst at James Capel.
After the first oil shock, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
encouraged companies to join forces in sales co-operatives that were able to
control prices. Nevertheless, Japan's 14 chemical companies remained
fiercely independent and have, until now, managed to avoid full-scale
mergers.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical and Mitsubishi Kasei are expected to report pre-tax
losses in the year to March, 1994. Furthermore, the increasing reluctance of
the Japanese authorities to protect the chemical industry from outside
competition makes their future look grim as well.
With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt, Japanese
chemical makers will face tariff reductions on imported chemicals of, on
average, more than 50 per cent in five years' time.
Against this background, Japanese chemical companies are being forced to
accept the necessity of consolidation to create larger, more efficient and
internationally competitive businesses.

insurance in Asia by investing in an Indonesian life insurance concern,
AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
AMP said it would enter into a transaction to invest more than ADollars 100m
(Dollars 65m) to buy 40 per cent of Panin Life Insurance, the largest life
insurance operation in terms of assets in Indonesia, and establish a joint
venture with Panin Life.
Panin Life is owned by Panin Bank, one of the largest privately held banks

FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi companies to merge
operations - Creation of Japan's biggest chemicals group could spark more
consolidations

Two Japanese chemical companies that belong to the Mitsubishi group of
companies plan to merge their operations in a move that will create the
largest chemical company in Japan.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the largest domestic petrochemical company in
which Shell Petroleum has a 12.6 per cent stake and Shell Japan a 5.7 per
cent stake, and Mitsubishi Kasei, the country's biggest all-round chemical
manufacturer, plan to merge next October on an equal basis.
The new company to be formed by the merger, Mitsubishi Chemical, will have
consolidated profits of more than Y1,000bn (Dollars 9.35bn) and a combined
share of more than 15 per cent of the domestic ethylene market.
The decision, aimed at increasing the companies' international
competitiveness, comes in the midst of one of the most difficult times for
Japan's petrochemical sector and is expected to encourage further
consolidation in the industry.
The country's chemical industry has not only suffered a prolonged business
slump in the domestic market, as leading customers in the auto, electronics
and construction industries have faced sharp declines in their businesses,
but is also facing growing competition overseas.
The problems of Japan's chemical manufacturers are not new. Overcapacity has
plagued the industry since the early 1980s and there have been persistent
rumours of consolidation for the past 10 years, according to Mr John
Chanoki, chemical industry analyst at James Capel.
After the first oil shock, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
encouraged companies to join forces in sales co-operatives that were able to
control prices. Nevertheless, Japan's 14 chemical companies remained
fiercely independent and have, until now, managed to avoid full-scale
mergers.
But as the Mitsubishi companies' merger reflects, the worsening business
environment has made independence a luxury that many Japanese chemical
companies can no longer afford.
The slowdown of the domestic economy has hit Japan's chemical companies at a
particularly difficult time. Overcapacity at home has been compounded by a
loss of export markets in south-east Asia where the Japanese have faced
growing competition from other countries, particularly from South Korea.
At the same time, the move of their large customers in the automobile and
electronics industries to increase production overseas has hurt the ability
of Japanese chemical manufacturers, which have not followed their customers
abroad, to compete with more low-cost overseas producers for their
traditional business.
Both Mitsubishi Petrochemical and Mitsubishi Kasei are expected to report
pre-tax losses in the year to March, 1994.
Furthermore, the increasing reluctance of the Japanese authorities to
protect the chemical industry from outside competition makes their future
look grim as well.
With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt, Japanese
chemical makers will face tariff reductions on imported chemicals of, on
average, more than 50 per cent in five years' time.
Against this background of increasing competition both at home and abroad,
Japanese chemical companies are being forced to accept the necessity of
consolidation to create larger, more efficient and internationally
competitive businesses.
The seriousness of the situation is underlined by the merger of the two
Mitsubishi companies which, despite belonging to the same Mitsubishi group
of companies with ties that go back to the pre-war zaibatsu business groups,
were known for their intense rivalry.
Mitsubishi Kasei, for example, has its own corporate symbol which its uses
more prominently than the three-diamonds symbol of the Mitsubishi group.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical, meanwhile, has not joined certain study groups on
environmental issues in which Mitsubishi Kasei has taken leadership.
Analysts expect the decision by the two Mitsubishi companies to ease the way
for other mergers in the industry, with Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals and Mitsui
Petrochemicals, two companies in the Mitsui group, at the top of the
candidates' list.
Within the Mitsubishi group there are three more chemical companies, which
are also likely candidates for further consolidation of the group's chemical
businesses.
Whether or not such mergers will strengthen the Japanese industry's
international competitiveness, however, is open to debate.
Unless the merger of the two Mitsubishi companies is accompanied by bold
restructuring that includes personnel cuts, two bad companies will not make
a good one, says Mr Chanoki.
Furthermore, in an industry where scale is crucial, even the Mitsubishi
merger which will create Japan's largest chemical company, will not bring
Japan close to the ranks of the world's largest chemical companies such as
EI du Pont de Nemours and Dow Chemical of the US, and the UK's Imperial
Chemical Industries. By sales, Mitsubishi Chemical is unlikely even to reach
the ranks of the world's top 10 chemical companies.

International Accounting Bulletin said the strong dollar depressed the

<TEXT>
Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian brewer, is granting an option to
Canada's Molson Company, which will allow the latter to acquire a further 10
per cent interest in the Molson Brewing Partnership.
The partnership is the brewing alliance between Foster's, Molson and Miller
Brewing, part of the New York-based Philip Morris group.
At present, Miller owns 20 per cent of Molson Breweries, while Foster's and
the Molson Company have 40 per cent each. Foster's said that the option was
sought 'to enable it to increase its interest in the Molson Brewing
Partnership to 50 per cent in certain circumstances'.
Foster's added: 'The granting of the option does not signal any intention of
Foster's to sell any of its interest, and if exercised, does not effect
partner voting rights.'
If the option was exercised, the price for the purchase of the 10 per cent
interest would be based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
Foster's said that the multiple was substantially greater than that paid by
Miller when it bought its interest in the Molson Brewing Partnership earlier
in the year.

Greece's state-owned Olympic Airways is to ask for a Dr17bn (Dollars 69m)
loan from state commercial banks in the first three months of 1994, Mr
Theodoros Tsakiridis, the company's managing director told reporters, Reuter
reports from Athens.
He said the loan would cover cash needs and other current operational
expenses and be guaranteed by the government. Olympic Airways had losses of
Dr22bn in 1993 and cumulative losses of about Dr400bn over the last five
years.
Meanwhile, the country's new socialist government is to re-apply to the
European Union to write off Dollars 1bn of state-owned Olympic Airways debt,
says transport minister, Mr Ioannis Charalambous. Informal discussions had
begun already.
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom is to acquire a stake in Societe Europeenne des
Satellites (SES), a Luxembourg company which operates the Astra satellite
television system, Reuter reports from Bonn.
SES said the German state telecommunications monopoly would acquire a
'representative stake' as part of a planned SES capital increase, but gave
no details.
SES and Telekom will also form a joint entreprise to develop digital
transmission technology for satellite and cable services in television and
radio.
Rothmans International said it would redefine its pan-Asian merger plans if
a major shareholder of its Malaysian unit persists with objections to the
original proposal, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong.
Shareholders in the unit, Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia), will vote Friday
on the plan, which has won unanimous backing from the other publicly-traded
unit in the deal, Rothmans Industries of Singapore.

FT  29 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Economic Insurance sold to management for
Pounds 11.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hafnia, the Danish insurance company, has sold its last UK operating
subsidiary to a management team led by the company's existing managing
director for Pounds 11.5m.
Economic Insurance, which provides 'innovative and specialised 'own label'
insurance products' for leading brokers as well as marketing policies under
its own name, plans to seek a London listing within the next two to three
years.
The buy-out, backed by Candover Investments with Causeway Capital, is the
latest in a series of disposals since Hafnia suspended payments to creditors
in August.
Investors have provided an additional Pounds 1.5m working capital for
Economic.
Economic came to the market in April 1993 when the sale of Hafnia's
insurance and financial services operation to a company in which Sun
Alliance has the dominant stake left it as an independent operating unit.
Economic said Sun Alliance opted against including Economic in its own
stable because of a lossmaking mortgage guarantee business from which
Economic has since been extricated.
Mr Peter Cullum, 43, who is leading the MBO team, persuaded Hafnia to agree
to the buy-out in June after several 'opportunistic' bids had been received.
Mr Cullum, who joined Economic as managing director in 1991 with a brief to
turn around the lossmaking company, said pre-tax profits in the year to
December 1993 would be more than Pounds 4m on a gross premium income of
Pounds 40m. Losses in the previous year totalled Pounds 5.5m.

Directors of VSEL, the Cumbrian-based builder of Trident submarines, said
they were 'disappointed' and were 'reviewing their position' following the

Villiers, the USM-traded company formerly known as Caspen Oil.
Last week Beverley said it had rescinded a previous agreement to sell the
offshoot to Sealand Industries, a subsidiary of VSEL. Beverley would be
contributing Pounds 40,000 to Sealand's costs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite an increase in turnover from Pounds 513,000 to Pounds 540,000,
Radiant Metal Finishing, which specialises in electroplating and dealing in
residential property, slipped from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1,000 to a
deficit of Pounds 24,000 for the half year ended August 31.
The company turned in losses of 1.79p per share (earnings of 0.09p), and 'in
the light of the depressed economic climate' is deferring any decision on
the payment of a dividend until the full year results are known.

FT  29 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Centregold share gift transaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Centregold, the publisher and distributor of video games and computer
software, has set a new trend in Christmas share dealings by disclosing a
gift transaction between its chief executive and managing director.
Shortly after the stock market closed on Christmas Eve the Birmingham-based
company announced that Mr Geoff Brown, the former mathematics teacher who
floated the company in October, was giving 200,000 shares to Mr Martyn
Savage, the managing director.
The gift, worth about Pounds 330,000 at Friday's closing price of 165p,
reduces Mr Brown's holding to 13.9m shares - representing 25 per cent of the
capital.
Mr Savage said he would be retaining the shares, which took his holding to
3.6 per cent.
'It was a personal gift reflecting Mr Brown's view that I deserved more than
I got out of the company. We were the driving force behind the flotation,'
he said.
The gift, supplementing Mr Savage's Pounds 90,000 basic annual salary and
performance-related bonuses, was a one-off gesture, he added.
Since the flotation Centregold shares have jumped sharply from the issue
price of 125p. The company's performance has been boosted by strong demand
in the run up to the holiday period.
Mr Savage said earnings next year would be boosted by new products and
revenue from exclusive video game rights for the Winter Olympics and the
World Cup.

FT  29 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Jams today mean jam tomorrow for Peek - The
rapid Asian expansion of an Pounds 89m a year traffic management business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anthony Gould enjoys traffic jams. He wallows in them in Kuala Lumpur and in
Jakarta.
He goes looking for them in China. In Bangkok, he sits back and lets the
traffic envelop him.
Mr Gould is head of the Asian operations of Peek, a British company
specialising in traffic control systems.
Asia has some horrendous traffic problems: Mr Gould and Peek see great
opportunities in offering solutions.
'In 1992 only 3 per cent of our turnover was in Asia' says Mr Gould. 'Within
three years we aim to have up to 40 per cent of our revenues generated in
this region.'
Peek started life 20 years ago as an investment holding company. Since a
capital reconstruction in 1986 it has specialised in various types of road
traffic equipment and management systems.
Peek now bills itself as the world's leading manufacturer of traffic
controllers, the boxes which sit by traffic lights and control the signals.
In recent years Peek has acquired the traffic control operations of Philips
in the Netherlands, and Ferranti traffic information systems. Other
businesses have been acquired in the Nordic countries, Germany and the US.
Turnover has risen from Pounds 14.7m in 1987 to Pounds 88.8m last year. Pre
tax profits last year were Pounds 7.1m.
Now, with business slow elsewhere, the focus is on the fast developing
countries of Asia.
The big prize so far has been a Pounds 6.5m contract won earlier this year
to supply and install traffic controllers at 143 junctions throughout
Bangkok.
The controllers will form an integrated network, with more than 2,000
detectors or sensors relaying information on traffic build-up at the
junctions to a central computer - a system aimed at reducing jams in a city
which is among the most traffic-clogged in the world.
Similar systems are in operation in 40 British towns and cities, including
central London.
'Bangkok and other Asian cities are now realising that traffic congestion is
a serious impediment to further growth' says Mr Gould.
'We don't offer all the solutions but at least we can be a big help.'
Peek is negotiating to install similar systems in Jakarta, the Indonesian
capital, and the nearby city of Bandung.
Business is promising in Malaysia.
In Singapore, Peek earlier this year took a 49 per cent stake in the local
Kee Eng Chin Electrical company, which installs and maintains traffic
equipment throughout the island republic.
Like many companies, Peek is looking to China for a great leap forward in
its business.
'The scale of the road building programme in China is staggering' says Mr
Gould.
'Over the next five years China plans to build more than 100,000km of
highway. And these plans are not just on the drawing board. Many of them are
already being put into action.'
At the beginning of the year, Peek took a 45 per cent stake in a largely
state controlled engineering company in Sichuan province in southern China.
The joint venture has been concentrating its sales efforts on Hainan, the
Chinese island south of Hong Kong which has long been a favourite holiday
destination among Chinese but is now designated as a special economic zone.
The local economy on Hainan has been growing at more than 20 per cent each
year - and high economic growth rates have brought traffic problems.
Peek recently signed a Pounds 3m contract to supply and install traffic
management systems in Haikou, Hainan's biggest city. Another Pounds 7m worth
of business is likely to grow out of the project.
'The contract took nine months to negotiate and involved us taking local
officials to Britain and showing them how the systems work there,' says Mr
Gould.
'Officials from all over China go to Hainan for conferences or for holidays
 -it's a great shop window for us.'
Traffic control is a very competitive business and others are intent on
grabbing a slice of the Asian market. Siemens of Germany, GEC of Britain and
Philips in Australia are Peek's main business rivals.
Mr Gould spends his time in traffic jams watching the lights and calculating
business possibilities.
'We could be doing nearly Pounds 100m of business in China alone within
three years' he says. 'It will mean a big investment in terms of marketing
and technology transfer. But the rewards make the effort very worthwhile.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of John Lusty Group, the lossmaking food importer, were suspended at
6 1/2 p on December 23 pending shareholders' approval of restructuring
proposals.
The USM-traded group is paying a maximum Pounds 3.64m for Trustin-Kerwood,
an importer of speciality foods.
The consideration, dependent on Trustin achieving pre-tax profits of Pounds
435,000 in the nine months to end-December, will involve the issue of up to
60.7m new shares, representing 60.98 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
Trustin, based in Bury St Edmunds, reported profits of Pounds 182,000
pre-tax for the 12 months to March 31 1993, on turnover of Pounds 8.43m.
Following completion, Mr Geoff Wilson and Mr Derek Wilson will join the
board as joint chief executives. Lord Charles Cecil, chairman of Trustin,
will be appointed non-executive chairman.
Mr David Hamp-Adams, the current chairman. will remain on the board in a
non-executive role.
Dealings in the enlarged group are expected to resume on January 25.

except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department
stores only). Industrial production: data from national government
sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water
supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK
(also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD
standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different
definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate
indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian
employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US -
help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all
jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Vauxhall suffers 17% profit fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, has suffered a fall in
pre-tax profits of about 17 per cent this year but has remained the most
profitable carmaker in Britain.
Pre-tax profit is understood to have fallen to about Pounds 185m in 1993
from Pounds 223.7m a year ago. Its share of the UK car market reached a
record of just over 17 per cent in 1993, but production has fallen 19 per
cent due to a drop in exports to depressed continental European markets.
Ford's share has been eroded to 22 per cent.
Vauxhall's two British assembly plants have worked at 82 per cent of
capacity this year, and the workforce has been cut by about 8 per cent to
9,900.
Vauxhall's operating profits declined more heavily than the pre-tax line,
dropping by about a third. Pre-tax performance in 1992 was depressed by a
Pounds 28.8m charge for the write-down of a stake in Cilva Holdings, the
holding company for Avis Europe, the car rental group.
Vauxhall has remained strongly in profit throughout the UK recession in
contrast to Ford and Rover, its two biggest rivals, which both fell into
loss. Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, returned to profit in the
second half, however.
GM's strong performance in the UK has been reinforced by IBC Vehicles, its
60-40 joint venture with Isuzu of Japan, which produces the Vauxhall/Opel
Frontera four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicle. IBC Vehicles has achieved
the best financial performance in the six years since it was formed from
GM's chronically loss-making Bedford van operations. It has quadrupled net
profits to about Pounds 20m and production increased to a record of close to
50,000.
GM's performance in the UK contrasts to its fortunes in other European
markets. Opel, its German subsidiary, has warned of a full-year loss.
Production of cars and car-derived vans at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port and
Luton assembly plants has fallen by 19 per cent to 244,500 from the record
301,800 in 1992. Luton was forced to halt production for a total of nearly
13 weeks.
Exports dropped 59.3 per cent to 45,398 and accounted for only 19 per cent
of output against 37 per cent a year ago. In the UK it increased sales 13.5
per cent to 302,000 in a market that has grown by about 11 per cent.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Steinhardt bids Dollars 250m to control America West
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Steinhardt, the New York money manager, has offered to pay
Dollars 250m (Pounds 167m) to gain control of America West Airlines, the
struggling Phoenix-based carrier which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection for the past two and a half years.
The investment, which will give Mr Steinhardt 80 per cent of America West,
should be enough to allow the airline to emerge from bankruptcy procedure.
Other investors, however, may make offers before the February 10 deadline
set by a Phoenix court.
The move by Mr Steinhardt, who runs Steinhardt Management, a hedge fund with
more than Dollars 3bn in assets, follows the withdrawal of a Dollars 150m
bid from an investment group led by the Pritzker family of Chicago and the
investment bank Wertheim Schroder. The Pritzker-Wertheim bid was said to
have been pulled because the group could not reach an agreement with America
West's chairman, Mr William Franke. The Steinhardt bid is believed to be
supported by Mr Franke.

FT  29 DEC 93 / An explosion on the edge of town: Retailing in eastern
Germany has overtaken the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No matter from which direction you drive into eastern Germany's main cities,
the landscape is unforgettable. It is not just the amount of work being
carried out on the infrastructure, but also the extraordinary expansion of
giant shopping centres, built on greenfield sites since unification.
The explosion is understandable. Before 1989, retailing in eastern Germany
was under-developed in choice and size - there were 0.3 square metres of
retail outlets per person in eastern Germany, compared with west Germany's
1-1.2 sq m.
The sector was monopolised by the Konsumgenossenschaft co-operatives which
consisted of department stores, supermarkets and small outlets; and the
Handelsorganisation, the state-run retail sector. After unification, both
chains were broken up. Parts were sold, others were forced into liquidation
as west German retailers rushed in.
Eastern German consumers went on a spending spree. By 1993 the east had
caught up with the west in terms of outlets. It had 2.6 shopping centres per
million inhabitants, compared with 1.8 in western Germany.
But the authorities in eastern Germany's main cities are beginning to
question the benefits. Mr Ralph Kausch, of the Leipzig's branch of the
Chamber of Industry and Commerce, has no doubt who the losers are: 'The
cities'. A struggle is taking place between the local councils, on whose
land the shopping centres are based, and the city governments, who want to
win back consumers.
'The shopping centres are chiselling away at the small retailers in the
city,' says Mr Kausch. Compared with western Germany, where about 80 per
cent of the large department stores/shopping centres are located in the
inner cities, only 20 per cent are in eastern Germany.
'More importantly', continues Mr Kausch, 'we are losing out financially
because we are not receiving tax from the turnover of the large stores.' He
reckons Leipzig is being deprived of tax on an annual DM900m (Pounds 360m)
turnover.
It is a different story for the local councils, who receive the turnover
tax. For example, the small council of Gunthersdorf, west of Leipzig, where
the 100,000 sq m Saale Park shopping complex is located, is expecting the
park to record a turnover of DM850m by 1995. Gunthersdorf has a population
of 650.
But why have cities such as Leipzig, Dresden and Berlin been unable to
attract the retailers into their centres and can they reverse the trend?
Retailers have stayed away because of exorbitant land prices and contested
property rights, whereas out of town they have found available land,
investment grants and no green lobbies or awkward planning regulations. Ms
Irena Krause, a senior official at Leipzig's planning department, says that
after the Berlin Wall came down, 'there was no clear definition of property
rights in the cities. But title was uncomplicated in the countryside. Land
was snapped up, often very cheaply, maybe for DM3m a square metre. The local
councils wanted to be part of the boom. They pushed through planning
permission and got new roads in return.'
Mr Stefan Brendgen from Jones Lang Wootton, the UK property consultants,
says retailers seeking land in the heart of east Berlin would have had to
pay DM20,000-DM30,000 a sq m in 1992, the boom period.
Because of these circumstances, Mr Cy Schluter, a retail analyst at CSFB in
Frankfurt, believes that the retailing environment in the east is more
advanced than in the west, where development has been hindered. 'The large
retailers could see the advantages of opening up in eastern Germany and
seized them.'
But can the large shopping centres in eastern Germany continue to reap the
benefits from an explosion in consumer spending? Next year Hornbach, the
large home improvement department store, expects its four outlets in eastern
Germany to account for a quarter of its total turnover, which last year
exceeded DM750m, largely because more people are renovating their homes and
the housing stock will soon be privatised.
Other branches, however, may be vulnerable - the food industry for instance.
'They face the most competition. Supermarkets are badly located. They are
not near the centre,' says Hornbach.
The large retailers also face the prospect of a decline in consumer spending
and lower purchasing power - incomes in eastern Germany are on average about
30 per cent lower than western German levels. The Cologne Institute for
Economic Forecasting reckons that after annual average growth in private
consumption of about 3.5 per cent between 1990 and 1992, the rate of growth
has slowed to about 1 per cent this year and will be lower next year.
The decline should still be less steep than in western Germany. But, as Mr
Kausch says, 'it's hard to make any firm conclusions'. In eastern Germany
retailing 'is still a moving target. But it is time the inner cities
responded to these vast shopping complexes by making the centres more
attractive to the consumer. That will take time. I hope we are not too
late.'

FT  29 DEC 93 / Wellcome Trust steers clear of rapid share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, will retain its near 40 per
cent in the Wellcome pharmaceutical group for the time being. The news could
lift one of the clouds which has overhung the drug company's shares.
When the Trust cut its stake in Wellcome in July 1992, from 73.6 to 40 per
cent through a sale of 270m shares at 800p each, it undertook not to sell
any more until January 1 1994. It has permission to reduce its holding to 25
per cent.
Mr Roger Gibbs, Trust chairman, is careful not to put a time on when it
might sell more. He points out that when Wellcome was floated in 1986 the
Trust undertook not to sell more shares for two years, but did not dispose
of any for six years.
The timing of the sale, which was criticised when it took place, has turned
out to be inspired. The Wellcome share price rose initially, but has since
fallen sharply - along with other drug companies - following the election of
the Clinton administration in the US and consequent concerns about cuts in
healthcare spending.
Wellcome's share price has dropped from the 800p at which the Trust sold to
651p, while the equity market has risen by more than 1000 points. The FT-SE
index, at 2348.0 on the day of the sale, has climbed to 3412.3.
The Trust's sale - which raised a net Pounds 2.18bn making it the largest
non-privatisation secondary offer in the UK - and the reinvestment of the
money, mainly in other UK equities, has enabled its portfolio to grow. Had
it not sold the shares, its portfolio would now be worth around Pounds 4.5bn
rather than its present valuation of Pounds 5.7bn.
Before the sale, the Trust's stake in Wellcome accounted for nearly all its
investments, providing 95 per cent of its income. But at the time Wellcome
shares had a low yield and the Trust was keen to boost its income to provide
more funds for research. Now its holding in Wellcome makes up just under 40
per cent of the portfolio and the income has risen from Pounds 91m in 1991
to an expected Pounds 215m in 1994.
Mr Gibbs says that the proceeds from the sale were largely reinvested before
sterling's exit from the ERM in September 1992. That event led to the fall
in interest rates which boosted the stock market.
He says that in 1993 the portfolio has done slightly better than the average
measured by the WM performance tables. A drag on the portfolio was the
decision to put Pounds 500m into an index fund. Mr Gibbs defends the move
saying that as a charity, the Trust had to demonstrate prudence in its
investments.
Eight fund managers were appointed to manage the money from January 1993 for
an initial three years. So far Mr Gibbs is happy with their performance,
although the Trust's charitable status will oblige it to re-examine the
managers at the end of the three-year term before re-appointing them.
One of the choices of managers, Newton Investment Management, was seen at
the time as surprising. It has a reputation as an aggressive investor in
equities and is thought to have done well with the Trust's money.
The Trust's portfolio is now 64 per cent invested in UK equities, 22 per
cent in international shares, 2 per cent in property, 3 per cent in
index-linked and 9 per cent in other gilt-edged stocks and cash.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Ford set to dispatch full-time executives to help Mazda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mazda, the troubled Japanese carmaker, will accept three senior executives
from Ford, the US carmaker which is its largest shareholder, in a move aimed
at ensuring its long-term survival.
Ford has agreed to send three full-time executives, including a senior vice
president, to Mazda. The appointments will increase the number of Ford
executives at Mazda from one to four and the number of seats Ford has on
Mazda's 42-member board from four to seven.
Mr Yoshihiro Wada, Mazda's president, said the move - to be formally
approved at a shareholder meeting in June - aimed to extend co-operation in
areas such as product development and use of global facilities.
However, the appointment of high-level executives from Ford highlights the
difficulties Mazda faces amid economic slowdown in Japan and overcapacity in
other world markets.
The Ford appointments were announced alongside a revamp of top management at
Mazda, with five board members retiring and Mr Wada assuming responsibility
for domestic marketing and sales. The move ties in with recognition within
Mazda that as markets have become saturated, carmakers must co-operate to
survive.
Mazda is suffering from the twin burdens of an underused state-of-the-art
manufacturing plant, in which it invested heavily, and a large distribution
network. It expects to post a Y32bn (Pounds 200m) pre-tax loss for the year
to March and is restructuring to regain profitability.
Meanwhile, ambitions to set up a manufacturing facility in Europe were
quashed when a plan to use Ford's manufacturing facility there fell apart
earlier this year.
While no plans have been announced on how the two could co-operate further,
Mazda said it hoped independent tie-ups with Ford, such as Mazda's
production of Ford Festivas in Japan and Ford's manufacturing of the Navaho
for Mazda in the US, could be developed into more long-term arrangements.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Flotations reach a five-year record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in the new issues market in 1993 reached a five-year high with 165
flotations, according to KPMG Corporate Finance.
The 165 total falls some 22 short of the level reached in 1988, which itself
saw slightly fewer than in the previous two years. However, this year's
flotations have raised the largest amount of new capital at Pounds 5.1bn
since KPMG's records began in 1984.
KPMG, which worked on 33 flotations in 1993, said 70 companies floated in
1992. Its figures exclude privatisations.
The flood of flotations, more than 40 per cent of which fell in the fourth
quarter of 1993, has prompted some concern. The fear is that the UK's
soaring equity market has attracted some less-than-likely 'wannabe' public
companies.
The most chilling tale to emerge from the new issues market this year is
that of a new and used car dealership called Swithland Group, which last
month collapsed into receivership less than two weeks after its bid to float
was thwarted by prescient City worries about its soundness.
Others issued profits warnings within months of floating. Drew Scientific,
for example, the diagnostic medical kits maker, floated in May and warned of
losses less than six months later in October.
Holliday Chemicals, the industrial dyes and specialty chemicals maker,
floated in March. In November it issued a warning about profits for the full
year, following a slight drop in the interim figures.
The sheer volume of new stock has forced investors to become highly
selective, leaving some issues to flail in lacklustre demand.
Some companies saw their share prices slip to a discount to the issue prices
in early trading. Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator is one example.
Lilliput Group, the maker of hand-painted miniature ornamental cottages, is
another - it floated at 135p in November but closed at 115p on Christmas
Eve.
'In general companies coming to the market are much better prepared and set
up for life as public companies than was the case in the late 1980s,' says
Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG Corporate Finance. He expects the
new issues market to remain strong in 1994.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Government urged to include track in ScotRail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Office is privately lobbying the Department of Transport to
amend its rail privatisation proposals for Scotland.
Potential bidders for ScotRail have warned the government that rail
privatisation will succeed in Scotland only if the franchise holder is given
control over the track.
Under present plans, franchises will be offered to run railways while track
and signalling will be operated by Railtrack, a separate company.
The Scottish Office has told potential bidders for ScotRail that it is
sympathetic to their demands for combining services with ownership of track
and signalling.
The Scottish Office yesterday said rail privatisation in Scotland was the
responsibility of the Department of Transport. It pointed out, however, that
Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, said bids in favour of vertical
integration may be considered for ScotRail.
If a prospective operator submitted a bid that included control over
infrastructure, it would be left to Mr Roger Salmon, the
government-appointed franchising director, to decide whether to accept it.
Under the present guidelines laid down by the Department of Transport, Mr
Salmon would be highly unlikely to do so. Any bid aiming to control the
track in Scotland would also be bitterly resisted by Railtrack, which is
chaired by Mr Bob Horton.
The Treasury strongly backs the Department of Transport's decision not to
relax its rail privatisation plans in Scotland. According to a Whitehall
official, both departments are 'fed up with the Scottish Office continually
pleading a special case north of the border'.
Nonetheless, pressure is growing in Scotland for ways to be found to bypass
the Transport Department's opposition. Mr Derek Scott, finance director of
Stagecoach, the acquisitive bus operator which is a likely bidder for the
ScotRail franchise, said privatisation would have a better chance of success
if the Department of Transport kept an open mind on the ownership of the
track.
Mr Chris Green, who will run ScotRail from April as a 'shadow franchise',
said that while he did not want to commit himself at this early stage, it
was clear that the Scottish franchise was 'the most 'self-contained of the
lot', with 95 per cent of trains never leaving Scotland.
ScotRail is one of the first seven franchises to be offered. The government
hopes to see ScotRail being run by the private sector by early 1995, after
running as a stand-alone concern within BR from next April.

FT  29 DEC 93 / German recession over, says economics minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's recession is over and the country can look forward to a steady,
strong recovery next year, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said
yesterday. 'At the end of the year, it is becoming clearer that the German
economy has come out of the trough,' he said.
Mr Rexrodt, who repeated his call for greater flexibility in working hours,
said he expected the economy, which this year will have shrunk by 2 per
cent, to grow between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent in 1994. This supports
recent estimates by the Bundesbank and reports issued yesterday by the RWI
institute for economic forecasting at Essen and the Cologne-based IW
institute.
However, several German economic institutes and business groups have warned
about continuing high unemployment, low investment and structural obstacles
to competitiveness.
The IW, which published its end-of-year poll of industry yesterday, warned
that the recovery would not be sustainable if growth was not matched by
higher investment and exports and tighter control on wages. Only a quarter
of sectors polled expected a rise in production next year, citing declining
export orders and high labour costs. However, the number of respondents
expecting a fall in turnover - nearly half in last year's survey - fell to a
third.
No institute or business group foresees any improvement in the labour
market. 'Hopes of a quick recovery which will noticeably benefit the labour
market are premature,' said Mr Hans Peter Stihl, head of the German
Federation of Chambers of Commerce. The economic institutes predict
unemployment, at present 7.8 per cent of the west German labour force, may
rise to between 8.2 and 9.5 per cent.
The bright spot is east Germany. Growth, which reached 6 per cent this year
 -after a contraction of 30 per cent between 1990 and 1992 - is expected to
rise to 7.5 per cent.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Consumers and industry set to spur US growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US businesses and consumers are getting ready to spend heavily on big
investments, raising hopes of strong growth next year.
Government and private sector economists say the recovery looks likely to be
sustained well into 1994 as consumers buy cars and houses, while businesses
speed up investment in machinery and computer equipment.
The Conference Board reported yesterday that its closely watched index of US
consumer confidence rose strongly again this month to 80.2, from a revised
71.9 in November, giving a rise of 20 points in two months.
Only the Pacific and middle Atlantic regions still show lower levels of
confidence than a year ago, and both have shown some recovery in optimism in
the past two months.
The December survey marked the sixth consecutive month in which consumers'
assessment of their situation had improved, although the biggest rise came
in future expectations.
Reports from credit card companies show that consumers have been taking
their new-found confidence shopping, with Mastercard seeing credit card
sales up 24 per cent in the pre-Christmas period this year, and Visa
experiencing 32 per cent growth.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's sector-by-sector review of US industry
predicts a median growth rate of 2.8 per cent in manufacturers' shipments
next year, spurred by increased consumer purchases and business investment
in capital equipment.
The rise is led by the sale of 14.8m cars and light trucks, a solid 6 per
cent increase from this year, and by the construction of 1.3m new homes, a 4
per cent gain from 1993. Shipments of household appliances are expected to
grow by 3.6 per cent.
Mr Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary of commerce, said the anticipated strength
of car sales was 'extremely good news not just for the auto industry but for
the entire economy'.
The fastest growing industrial sectors in the Commerce Department's annual
review both benefit from the strong car industry: metal cutting machinery,
whose sales are projected to grow by 12.8 per cent, and electronic
components, where an 11.1 per cent advance is expected.
The weakest sectors are expected to be defence-related industries such as
aircraft parts, navigational equipment and shipbuilding.
The department predicts a decline in venture capital, and expects savings
institutions to lose some of their share of the mortgage market to other
lenders. The banking sector is expected to be profitable for the third
consecutive year.

FT  29 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Tax treatment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Against this background, any tinkering with the tax treatment of pension
funds would come at a delicate moment. By lowering funds' tax credit on
dividends in March, the government reduced surpluses and increased
companies' pension costs. The Treasury resisted the temptation to come back
for more in the November budget, but that may only be a stay of execution.
It would be strange if the review of taxation of savings to be carried out
by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, did not
scrutinise pension funds at all.
Combined with the demands of a new solvency test and a rigorous accounting
standard, tougher tax treatment could give companies just another reason for
turning away from defined-benefit schemes. There is little sign of such a
move as yet. Membership of occupational schemes has been in decline for some
years, but companies are waiting for the shape of reform to become clear
before deciding what kind of pension risks they are prepared to shoulder.
The unfolding personal pensions scandal may draw attention to the
attractions of occupational final-salary schemes. If companies are unwilling
to shoulder their share of the risks, though, employees will have little
choice.

FT  29 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Company reaction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For companies, what steps they are required to take if the solvency
threshold is breached is also important. The Goode proposal that companies
should have three months to make amends, if the fund falls below 90 per cent
solvency, looks harsh. Companies could find themselves facing a sudden and
unexpected liability. The strain on corporate cash flow could be intense,
especially for companies with a large pension scheme in relation to their
current business. Faced with that risk, companies might prefer the comfort
of a money-purchase scheme instead.
The solvency debate underlines that valuing pension funds is an inexact
science. Since pension surpluses make up a large proportion of earnings for
some companies, that is of concern for the equity market too. The current
accounting standard for pension costs allows companies a great deal of
latitude in choosing what assumptions are used when valuing the pension
fund. The Accounting Standards Board is therefore right to press for greater
consistency.
The ASB faces the same dilemma as the Goode Committee. Prudence demands that
pension costs should not be understated. But rules that are too tight might
drive companies away from final salary schemes altogether.
Valuing pension liabilities anually with reference annuity rates - the cost
of buying deferred annuities from insurance companies - is the method
favoured by many accountants. That would provide a common benchmark between
companies. Since annuity rates rise and fall with gilt yields, and depend on
the willingness of insurance companies to sell such policies, a more
volatile pension charge could also result. In periods of very low bond
yields - 1994 looks like being a good example - companies would also face
much higher pension costs than are currently being charged.

FT  29 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Solvency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Goode Committee's proposals for a minimum solvency standard could have
the widest implications of all. A system of prudential regulation clearly
needs to ensure that pension funds are adequately funded, but solvency is a
slippery concept. The Goode approach is meant to ensure that funds always
have sufficient assets to provide members with the benefits they have
accrued.
Calculating the current value of future benefits - the so-called cash
equivalent - can be tackled several ways. Using gilt yields as a benchmark
is common among actuaries calculating the value of benefits accrued by
individuals transfering between schemes. Using this approach as the basis
for an industry-wide solvency test, though, could create problems.
With liabilities linked to gilts for solvency purposes and assets held in
equities, many funds would face a mismatch. A bear market in equities
combined with falling gilt yields - as happened in 1974 - could result in a
sudden erosion of solvency. As a preventive measure, funds invested heavily
in equities would come under pressure to switch more of their assets into
gilts. If that resulted in lower returns, pensioners would suffer.
The actuarial profession is trying to square the circle. A method of valuing
cash equivalents in relation to equities may provide a partial solution. But
striking a balance between the need to maximise investment returns and the
overriding requirement for prudence will not be easy.

FT  29 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Pensions under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The mis-selling of UK personal pensions uncovered in the final months of the
year will doubtless reverberate through 1994, especially for companies found
guilty of malpractice. But the shape of retirement provision in the UK is
being decided elsewhere. The regulatory reforms proposed by the Goode
Committee, which delivered its report in October, have been accepted by
government and are now in the consultation process. Last month Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, promised a review of taxation of savings which will
presumably include pension funds. In the New Year, the Accounting Standards
Board plans to review the way companies account for pension costs.
Better prudential regulation, a more rational tax regime and greater
consistency in accounting are all worthy objectives. But there are pitfalls
along the way. The greatest danger is that reforms will, in aggregate,
discourage companies from setting up defined-benefit occupational pension
schemes.
With contributions on a rising trend, companies already have a reason to
consider money-purchase schemes instead. There can be no surplus or
contribution holiday under such an arrangement, but the investment risk lies
with scheme members. Once companies are making full contributions, making
the transition would involve no additional cost. If reform is seen to
increase the long-term risks of running defined-benefit schemes, the
incentive to switch would be great.
Any drift to money-purchase schemes would have implications for financial
markets too, since such funds generally pursue more risk-averse investment
strategies. In the long run, pension funds would probably hold more gilts
and fewer equities.

FT  29 DEC 93 / He must have got something right: After a year of Washington
battles and media intrusion, has Bill Clinton learnt the ropes as US
president?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty years ago, in John Kennedy's time, about three-quarters of the
American public had an underlying faith in their national government to get
things broadly right. Today that proportion is barely more than one-fifth.
Cynicism has even grown over the past year. When Bill Clinton became the
42nd president of the United States, over 70 per cent were confident that he
could bring about at least some of his promised 'change' to the governance
of the country. After one of the busiest and most legislatively successful
first years in two generations of presidents, only a little over half could
say they had seen 'change'.
If public opinion was all that mattered - and it does matter a lot to a
president with sensitive populist antennae - then Mr Clinton would, at best,
be enjoying a mixed Christmas. His own ratings have been rising again on the
back of an improving economy and big victories in Congress such as on Nafta,
but are still modest enough by historical standards. Just when it seems the
country is becoming more comfortable with him, he is dogged by stories, many
of them old, wild and politically motivated, that his private and financial
life has been less than pristine. The convenient silence that masked what
presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy did in their spare time has been replaced
by an inquisitive public cacophony.
For the record, these charges, by state troopers and old political enemies
in Arkansas, are that sexual liaisons were arranged for him while he was
governor, and possibly afterwards; that his wife, Hillary, had an affair
with Vincent Foster, her Little Rock law partner and later White House legal
counsel who committed suicide last summer; that a real estate investment in
the mid-1980s by the Clintons in partnership with the former chief executive
of a now defunct Arkansas savings and loan institution may have involved the
improper diversion of funds for political purposes, of which Mr Foster may
have been aware. The Clintons have denied all the allegations.
In part Mr Clinton is the victim of circumstances beyond his considerable
abilities to control. Having used the proliferating new media well to get
elected, he is now the invariable target of an ubiquitous punditocracy
making instant judgments on everything that moves. It is simply no longer
possible for a president to command the heights of network television and
establishment newspapers, as Ronald Reagan could a decade ago, now that news
and opinion flash instantly across a melange of cable stations, computer
screens and talk shows.
Political Washington has also refused to go down on bended knee to a
president demanding that it end gridlock. Party discipline has ceased to
mean much, unless the Republicans coalesce to resist tax increases or dig in
over gun control. On the deficit-cutting budget act and Nafta, defeat for
either of which would have been disastrous for his presidency, Mr Clinton
won the support of only 27 out of 53 Democratic senators and 78 of 258
Democratic members of the House.
With the Democrats often unwilling to act like a 'presidential' party, each
legislative battle has to be approached anew to put together a perennially
shifting, but winning, coalition. How healthcare fares next year is anyone's
guess as mid-term elections approach. Many Democrats, aware that they have
lost the six biggest state and mayoral elections since Mr Clinton won in
November last year, consider too close an association with him a political
liability.
In these circumstances, it is a minor miracle that he has achieved so much.
As he reflected in one of many year-end interviews, 'my biggest surprise in
a negative sense - one I shouldn't have been surprised by - is that there
really is a Washington culture that needs to be changed but has to be dealt
with if you want to get anything done'.
In that dealing, however, Mr Clinton and his team have not always been
adept. They got off to a bad start when two women, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood,
were disqualified from serving as attorney general because of 'nannygate'
problems (indeed, the pace of appointments to senior government positions
remains disappointingly slow, with the White House to blame as much as
Congress). Redeeming a campaign promise to force the military to end its ban
on homosexuals proved a protracted distraction. There was a badly handled
scandal in the White House travel office. The Republicans sandbagged the
Dollars 17bn mini-stimulus package and the economy took time to pick up.
Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia all brought foreign policy grief. Relations
between the White House and a critical media reached a nadir.
Three factors lay behind the mid-summer turnround. David Gergen, denizen of
past Republican administrations, was recruited as chief spin doctor, at
which he is an artist, with George Stephanopoulos moved to his proper place
as a policy adviser. Ruth Bader Ginsburg proved to be a popular choice to
fill Mr Clinton's first vacancy on the Supreme Court (the first Democratic
appointee in 26 years). And, after a strenuous and bitter debate, the budget
act prevailed - by precisely one vote in the House.
The budget victory proved particularly important because it demonstrated
that Mr Clinton, suspected of being a softie, could exert political muscle.
Some earlier successes in Congress (such as the family leave bill
guaranteeing employment rights) were long in the legislative pipeline,
blocked only by President George Bush's vetoes. But the next battle, Nafta,
was one in which it appeared that Mr Clinton, off to a late start, might
lose. Not only did he win with some ease in the end, but his trade
negotiators delivered a generally applauded Uruguay Round agreement.
Capping the year, the Brady bill was passed after seven years of failure
under Republican administrations, with the promise of more gun control
proposals next year. More than that, he responded to public angst over the
crime wave with a series of hardheaded speeches, one to the Reverend Martin
Luther King's old church in Memphis, on the need for individuals to assume
responsibility for the safety of their own communities.
But even this record leaves Washington and the wider public wondering if the
president and his administration have learnt the ropes. This brings to mind
a prescient comment last year by James Carville, his campaign manager. Mr
Clinton, he said, 'is a man blessed - or cursed - with the ability to make
connections' in policy terms.
Being smart and curious he compartmentalises very little, though even some
friends think he has some difficulty differentiating between the merely
interesting (because everything is interesting) and the truly important. One
small indication was his FT interview in July when he digressed at length on
the contrasts in structural unemployment between France, Germany and Japan -
not the US. He knew his stuff but your correspondent was accustomed to
hearing such detailed views from an assistant secretary of state or the
Treasury - not from a man with as much on his plate as the president.
Thus his administration has come to resemble not a Reagan or Bush pyramid,
when only the most important subjects ever reached the presidential desk,
but a wheel in which all spokes point to the Oval Office. As a result of
this, combined with his insistence on collegiality, few of his cabinet can
be said really to have emerged as forces in their own right. Bruce Babbitt
at interior and Henry Cisneros at housing have, as did Janet Reno, the
attorney general, after the Waco debacle but before the sophisticated
Washington scalpels were turned in the direction of this plain-speaking
daughter of a Florida alligator wrestler. Even a conspicuously effective
Treasury operates very much as part of the team and its secretary, Lloyd
Bentsen, is said to be contemplating retirement within a year.
No part of his government has taken more of a public pummelling than the
foreign policy team, which is a problem for a president who came to office
with a keen intellectual interest in external affairs but needing
experienced guidance through the thicket. Mr Clinton had deliberately
emphasised his domestic priorities by breaking with tradition a year ago in
naming first his economic and social policy cabinet, and its first departure
proved to be Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, because he had lost his
president's confidence. Mr Clinton only left the country on an extended trip
once this year - pegged to a Group of Seven summit in Tokyo that required
his attendance.
The main complaint is the lack of a conceptual framework and coherent
strategies for grappling with the complex post-cold war world. Some
criticisms may not be entirely fair; none of the trilogy of Bosnia, Somalia
and Haiti is exactly central to US national interests and all were inherited
and intractable problems. Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, may be
no visionary - as yesterday's appointment of Mr Strobe Talbott as his new
deputy implicitly recognises - but he thinks his way through issues and his
caution means the US is unlikely to rush into some quagmire from which it
extricates itself only with great pain.
Still, initial pledges of a new multilateralism have proved an on-again
off-again experience, with growing distrust of the United Nations apparatus.
Relations with western Europe, rocked over Bosnia, could be improved.
Constancy has been displayed in putting economic security on the front
burner of foreign policy, in backing Middle East peace negotiations and in
supporting reform in Russia, though that confidence has now been dented by
this month's elections. Mr Clinton has at least five big foreign trips on
his new year itinerary, four to Europe, one to Asia with diversions, for
example, to the Middle East, always possible, but this may only mean even
more spokes of the administration wheel pointing to his overcrowded desk.
Yet, the ups and downs of the first year notwithstanding, there has been a
sense of exhilaration and innovation in Washington unlike any other western
capital, even if their impact is still not measurable on Gallup's Richter
scale. And most of them flow from the president and, in important social
policy respects, from his wife. His first year might not be entirely as he
would have wished but, as a start, it was, on balance, impressive. A senior
member of the Bush administration has taken to warning that Mr Clinton might
get re-elected in 1996. Clearly he must be doing something right.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Risky business of a high-tech future: Products to watch out
for in '94
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So rapid is the pace of technological change that one year's runaway success
could well be the following year's flop - or vice versa. As companies strive
to ensure their high-tech products turn out to be hits rather than
embarrassments, they have to take considerable risks. The danger is of
consumers holding back from buying products until they are well established
 -compact discs, for instance, took six years to take off. Some of the
following products to watch in 1994 may not become popular overnight, but
they should point the way to the future.
Apple Computer's Newton received plenty of brickbats when launched last
year, mainly because it appeared shaky at recognising users' handwriting.
But sales of the pen-based message pad computers have been rising.
Other manufacturers have also brought out single products combining the
functions of a diary, personal organiser, games player and information
provider. Though the Newton is not cheap, at Dollars 699 in the US (Pounds
645 in the UK), and the extra software applications lighten the purse
further - new features will include the Fortune 500 top business guide and
the UK's Good Food Guide - the market has definitely been created.
You have heard of virtual reality, but how about virtual acoustics or even
virtual instruments? The new offering from Japan's Yamaha will be keyboards
designed to mimic the way wind, string and other instruments play rather
than using stored sounds.
The software simulates the vibrations and resonances of real instruments.
Using a keyboard, musicians will be able to produce the sounds of a
clarinet, saxophone or electric guitar; they will also be able to manipulate
the sounds, creating, for example, a hybrid based on woodwind, brass,
strings and electric guitar. The keyboard will cost about Pounds 4,000,
making it a product for the professionals.
In the office, the trend is towards all-in-one machines. Oki had a hit in
1993 with DOC. IT, a combined fax, printer, copier and document scanner. Now
another Japanese company, Ricoh, is introducing its IFS (intelligent
facsimile system), which also communicates with personal computers.
Developed with Microsoft, the US software company, the IFS is operated with
a touch-screen panel. Text and graphics files can be sent between personal
computers through the IFS, which has built-in security features.
Tomorrow's telephones will be far cleverer than those used today. The phones
on Mercury's One-2-One mobile network in the UK contain an array of
electronic circuitry that enables users to record messages and check their
current charges.
Made by Motorola of the US and Germany's Siemens and costing Pounds 250, the
One-2-One phones, which comprise about 70 electronic components, are
operated with simple press buttons. Each One-2-One phone has a smart card
with a chip for users' personal numbers, billing details and a personal
phone directory; it also enables them to use other compatible phones.
Consumers are not rushing to buy digital compact cassettes (DCC) and
players, but Philips of the Netherlands and Matsushita of Japan remain
confident that the products will win a place in the audio market.
Pre-Christmas sales of DCCs and their players were tiny. But Philips is
pinning its hopes on portable and in-car systems where the market is bigger
than for home units.
Most parents may despair at their children's appetite for video games, the
market for which is growing inexorably. Games such as Acclaim's Mortal
Kombat are played by millions of teenagers.
Mortal Kombat, says 13-year-old Californian teenager Erick Arnold, was 'the
biggest 'gimme' for kids aged between nine and 13 at Christmas'. Why do they
want this gruesome game? 'Because it's cool.' Many parents hate it, however.
Nintendo has left the horrific bits out of its version while Sega requires
the user to punch in a special code to access the most violent images. The
CD is becoming the all-purpose information carrier, reproducing music and
voice and storing computer data. It is a prime component of the growing
family of multi-media products.
Philips has invested heavily in its interactive compact disc (CD-I), a
multi-media system combining digital sound, pictures and text. A simple
connection to a television enables video games and full-motion digital
videos to be played on the TV, as well as music CDs. At Pounds 550, the full
CD-I player, combining voice, pictures and music in a single higher-quality
home entertainment system, is good value. Some people have trouble taking
still pictures, let alone moving ones. So makers of camcorders vie with each
other to make their products smaller, quicker and simpler to use. Sharp's
ViewCam has a tiny screen instead of a viewfinder, so the user can see what
is being filmed even if it is being held up to shoot over crowds. The UK
price ranges from Pounds 899 to Pounds 1,399.
There is no excuse for getting lost any more. The use of satellites to
pinpoint location at sea is common. Now, with falling prices and improving
software, so-called 'global positioning devices' are being targeted at those
who enjoy hill walking and hiking, yachting, mountain biking or hunting -
any pursuit where knowledge of location and direction is needed.
US companies Magellan and Garmin are among those concentrating on this
growing consumer market. Magellan's simplified hand-held electronic
navigators with graphic display screens cost about Pounds 440; its Meridian
model is designed for use on yachts and power boats and the Trailblazer for
land.
When news of US approval for Betaseron, the multiple sclerosis drug, came
through last summer, shares of Schering, which developed the drug, shot up.
Made for the German company by California-based Chiron, the drug does not
cure MS, which weakens the nervous system, but is the first effective
treatment for the disease. The main problem for Schering is whether
Betaseron can be made fast enough to meet demand; US approval came more
quickly than expected.
For those keen on exercise, but not on jogging, cross-country ski machines
for the home may be the answer.
NordicTrack of the US sells its products by mail order in Europe;
Lillywhites, the London sports store, has started selling a machine made by
Precor, also of the US. With adjustable stride and tension, it enables the
user to exercise in a way which is 'easy on the joints and muscles'. For
those wanting an element of 'enhanced motivation', set speeds can be
programmed. Jogging in the open is cheaper, though. Precor's machine costs
Pounds 699.

At a season associated with the arrival of wise men, the establishment of a
new institution to supervise European monetary arrangements might be
heralded as a sign of hope. The European Monetary Institute is being
formally set up on January 1 as part of the European Union's so-called
'second stage' of progress towards economic and monetary union. By
concentrating on a few necessary tasks, firmly defined by governments and
central banks, the EMI can improve the prospects for successful monetary
integration.
Conceived as an embryonic European central bank, the institute will have to
lower its sights from the ideas that inspired its creation. An important
priority will be to improve co-ordination within the present European
Monetary System, which is a long way from carrying out its original and
still badly needed function of providing a stable exchange rate environment
for European business.
In view of the EMS disturbances since autumn 1992, along with other setbacks
to the Maastricht timetable for a single currency, the gestation period for
the new monetary body has been highly problematic. Because of delays in
deciding to place the institute in Germany, the EMI will not even be able to
move to a permanent home in Frankfurt before the summer.
In 1988-89, when plans for setting up the institute were first laid, the
European Commission, backed by the French and Italian governments, wanted it
to carry out some fully-fledged central banking operations. This idea has
been watered down, above all because of opposition from the German
Bundesbank. Monetary decision-making will remain the preserve of the EMI's
12 member central banks. French-backed proposals for the EMI to help manage
currency reserves look unlikely to get off the ground.
Harmonisation drive
The task of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the EMI's designated president, will
thus be to assemble a staff of statisticians and economists, rather than to
wield power.
This does not mean that the EMI will not have a job to do. First, it will
have to accomplish detailed technical work to prepare for the harmonisation
of monetary statistics and money market instruments that forms an essential
precondition for Emu. If the harmonisation drive leads to an increase in
efficiency of different countries' monetary systems, then the benefits would
extend beyond making Emu more viable.
Second, the EMI can provide a forum for general debate on European monetary
matters. Mr Lamfalussy sees the need to uphold the consensus on the
desirability of Emu, but he also has the experience and independence to
speak plainly about the hurdles that lie in its path. He will be helped in
his task of nurturing public understanding of Europe's unhealthily secretive
central banking system, if the EMI is required to publish detailed minutes
of its monthly meetings of central bank governors.
Vital arbiter
Third, in a less high-profile role, the EMI president can function as an
arbiter, providing advice and assistance to member countries. The
misunderstandings and mismanagement evident during the monetary system
flare-ups in September 1992 and July-August 1993 could have been lessened
had an intermediary been on hand to adjudicate between countries pursuing
different monetary priorities, or even to ensure that rival positions were
clearly communicated and understood.
After the upsets of the past 17 months, it seems still more likely than
before that Emu, if it takes place at all, will be reached first by a
relatively small group of countries willing to combine a lasting political
commitment to Emu with a readiness to gear their monetary policies to
Germany's. If monetary convergence stops short of Emu, the task of managing
that process will require expertise and sensitivity of the highest order.
Creating a new institute will not, by itself, solve Europe's monetary
problems. But if it can successfully combine the roles of trouble-shooter
and think-tank, the EMI will have a good chance of bringing Europe closer to
objectives that individual central banks are incapable of fulfilling. It is
a welcome addition to the institutional landscape of the European Union.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Another fudge from Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government looks as if it has failed to grasp the seriousness
of what has become, by some measures, the country's worst recession since
the second world war. After 32 months of economic slowdown or decline, the
economy has failed to respond to record low interest rates and Y30,000bn
(Dollars 272bn) of public spending packages. A credit squeeze is under way
and several private sector economists fear a deflationary spiral.
The latest batch of economic measures from Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's
government, delivered just before Christmas, offers only a vague restatement
of earlier promises to cut income tax and red tape. This reflects the prime
minister's difficulties in keeping a fragile coalition together. Yet, the
government will prolong the recession - and shorten its own life - unless it
turns to more courageous solutions.
Poor implementation is part of the reason why current policies are failing
to work, but only a small part. The Bank of Japan has been too slow to cut
interest rates, due to its wish to make sure that the bubble of the late
1980s has been fully deflated, while local government has dragged its heels
in implementing infrastructure projects, not least because officials fear
attracting the attention of public prosecutors by letting contracts to
companies with which they have had previous contact.
But the real problem is that government, along with the business
establishment, has addressed only the symptom of Japan's economic malaise,
weakness of demand. The underlying problems are a credit squeeze caused by
the collapse in asset prices during the recession and the structural
overcapacity built up in Japan's maturing industrial economy over the past
decade or so. The car industry alone admits to overcapacity equivalent to
the entire car market of Britain or France.
Bad debts
In the two years to the end of 1992, the Economic Planning Agency calculates
that stock and land prices fell by a total of Y611,674bn (Dollars 5,560bn) -
a collapse likened by one Tokyo economist to the effects of a war. This has
saddled banks with mounting bad debts from dud property deals and weakened
their own reserves, much of which are made up from unrealised equity
profits.
What Japan therefore needs is aggressive action to improve corporate
profitability and the supply of credit. Unfortunately, many of the largest
companies' markets are so mature that the only way to improve profits is to
reduce break-even levels, which means wholesale job cuts. The job reductions
and transfers so far have been small, and in many cases have had the effect
of merely shifting costs from parent companies to subsidiaries. The state's
guiding hand is still so strong in the private sector that companies are
unlikely to do more without a government push. There are no signs of this.
State assistance
On credit, the banking industry has made great progress in writing off the
bad loans exposed by the recession and in letting hopeless cases die
naturally. But bad debts are still building up faster than write-offs.
Here, the US experience in dealing with its savings and loans crisis shows
the way. The weakest banks need state assistance, in the form of cheap
credit at the official discount rate from the Bank of Japan. Encouragingly,
this idea yesterday won the support of the Japan Renewal party, which sets
the tone for the ruling coalition's economic policy.
On top of this, the government should make it practical for banks to
securitise bad loans. The Bank of Japan has dropped its former caution on
securitisation and even the conservative finance ministry is now studying
the idea. The government is also, sensibly, less keen than was the LDP on
using public savings to support the stock market and hence banks' capital
ratios. So there is hope for progress on credit.
Politically, however, the signs are far from re-assuring. The coalition is
limping into the new year in such a divided and fragile state that it looks
incapable of delivering firm policy. Dithering over the economy has already
cost Mr Hosokawa 10 percentage points in the public opinion ratings, but at
60 per cent, he still has a strong mandate. It would be a pity if it took a
deeper crisis to provoke action.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Blueprint for local government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN EASTEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Contrary to the assertion in your leader, 'Local difficulties'
(December 22), the Local Government Commission has recommended many of the
structures that your leader supports.
Thus, you argue for the retention in 'much of England outside the
conurbations' of the two-tier system. We have recognised this in many of the
largely rural areas of the counties we have reviewed so far.
You also support the principle of single unitary authorities for the larger
cities. So does the commission, provided the wider strategic issues
concerned continue to be seen within a framework of a structure plan which
encompasses the wider surrounding area, which is the case both in
Middlesbrough and Bristol.
The commission does indeed undertake systematic and objective opinion
research, to help determine local feelings of communities, and to help gauge
reaction to its draft recommendations. It has also received many thousands
of other representations. We are obliged by our guidance from the secretary
of state to 'take into account people's expressed preferences'. This we have
done. There is no national blueprint.
Clearly it is not possible in a review of this kind to please everyone. In
particular, there is a need on the part of all those concerned to think
ahead and to determine a structure which will ensure that local government
in the future meets the needs of the community in such a way that many of
the functions now undertaken by quangos may instead become the
responsibility of local authorities with clear accountability for the way
they carry them out.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Plug standard claims need
investigating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON HOSSACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As the 'individual' referred to in Mr M J Davison's letter (December 7)
concerning the adoption by the UK of the harmonised plug and socket system
being proposed by Cenelec, the European standards setting body, I would like
the opportunity to respond.
I am not, as he stated, in disagreement with the whole of the electrical
industry in the UK - only a particularly vocal part of it. The proposed new
Cenelec system is not dangerously compatible with the British 13 amp system,
and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents most certainly cannot
be considered 'truly independent' given the fact that its electrical safety
consultant also works for the UK's largest and best-known manufacturer of
moulded 13 amp plugs and cordsets.
British manufacturing industry will not be 'severely disadvantaged'; indeed
the UK plug manufacturers' own trade association, Eiema, supports
harmonisation based on an unfused 16 amp MK design which would also require
the demise of the 'ring-main' - and cost just the same as the Cenelec
proposal.
The British consumer will not 'face an astronomic bill for replacing all
plugs and sockets' - in fact, the introduction of the new system will
potentially save UK consumers hundreds of millions of pounds every year.
To state that the 'British 13 amp system' is 'probably the safest in the
world' is misleading - as anyone who has read the Department of Trade and
Industry's consumer safety accident reports relating to plugs can attest.
These reports clearly show that of all the accidents involving plugs in the
UK, the single greatest cause (nearly 60 per cent) is the physical size and
fundamental design of the 13 amp plug itself.
Indeed, only a couple of years ago a highly respected ex-director of Mr
Davison's own company, MK, told me that 'nobody in their right mind would
subscribe to a fused plug'.
Clearly someone has got their facts very badly wrong. Accordingly, I ask
both Mr Davison and Mr Dossett, of Eiema, to join me in asking any
shareholder or director of any company with an interest in or around this
area, and who is concerned about that company's future, to ask for an
immediate investigation by the Office of Fair Trading and the European
Commission's competition directorate DG IV, into the veracity of all the
various claims and counter-claims that have been circulated.
I suspect that the threat of a fine of up to 10 per cent of their companies'
gross annual turnover should concentrate wonderfully the minds of those
currently engaged in exaggeration of the facts. Simon Hossack,

FT  29 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Fiddles' in jobless statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The renewed line in official unemployment - those unemployed and
claiming benefit - in recent months has enabled government spokesmen to
rubbish all talk of administrative fiddles, which greeted the initial
downturn in unemployment in March. Such 'fiddles' could result from the
targets set the employment service in respect of both inflows on to and
outflows from the claimant count.
Food for thought, however, is provided by the recently published results of
this summer's household-based labour force survey, which estimates
unemployment using an entirely different approach based on internationally
agreed guidelines; the so-called International Labour Organisation
unemployed are those without a job, who were available to start work during
the two weeks following their LFS interview and had looked for work during
the previous four.
One result is that ILO unemployment, seasonally adjusted, rose between
spring and summer, when claimant unemployment was falling.
Of even greater interest is the divergent movement in the two components of
ILO unemployment. The number of ILO unemployed claimants (those unemployed
on both definitions) has fallen by the same extent as the official claimant
count. On the other hand, the numbers of ILO unemployed non-claimants -
those who are ILO unemployed but are eligible for benefit - rose by 130,000
between spring and summer. Although these figures are not seasonally
adjusted, ILO unemployed non-claimants now stand at 1.08m - the highest
since the series began in 1983.
The divergent behaviour of these two components of ILO unemployment may mean
that it is premature to dismiss talk of administrative fiddles affecting the
value of the claimant count either as an indicator of labour market
performance or as a measure of social welfare.
