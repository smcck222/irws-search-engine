FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Morris Ashby rises to Pounds 839,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On turnover up 42 per cent from Pounds 8.13m to Pounds 11.6m in the six
months to September 30, Morris Ashby, the USM-quoted diecasting and
machining group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 839,000, an increase of
31 per cent on the previous Pounds 639,000.
Mr Norman Gardner, chairman, said: 'Overall, only one of our top 20
customers placed less business with us.'
He added that the long term future looked healthy with a strong forward
order book, but some customers were showing less confidence than had been
expected.
Earnings per share were 6.3p (5.5p) and the interim dividend is raised to 2p
(1.7p).

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BSS advances 24% to Pounds 5.06m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSS Group, the heating, plumbing and process control supplier, lifted
pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.06m for the six months to
end-September, despite the continuing recession in construction.
Turnover rose from Pounds 112.5m to Pounds 123.3m. Industrial and commercial
sales rose from Pounds 74.9m to Pounds 78.5m. Mr Alan Milne, finance
director, said the group had increased its market share while the overall
market had fallen. Operating profit in the division rose from Pounds 5.38m
to Pounds 6.88m.
Sales in the domestic division, now the UK's second biggest distributor to
the heating market, increased from Pounds 37.6m to Pounds 44.8m, reflecting
in part the acquisition of Cadel last year. But the division fell into the
red to the tune of Pounds 567,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 172,000.
In July BSS put Cadel and two other recent acquisitions together to create
Zenith Plumbpoint. Mr Milne said there were signs of a small upturn in the
domestic division's depressed market.
Overall, Mr Milne said the group had seen the bottom of its market, and
profits would rise. It would continue to increase market share, improve
margins and improve its domestic business.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 776,000 to Pounds 515,000.
Earnings per share increased from 11.4p to 12.3p, reflecting the increased
number of shares in issue after last year's rights. The interim dividend is
maintained at 5.75p.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sturge falls to Pounds 1.21m after Lloyd's
dispute provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An operating loss on insurance activities and a Pounds 2.5m provision to
cover the potential costs of resolving Lloyd's disputes cut pre-tax profits
at Sturge Holdings from Pounds 7.75m to Pounds 1.21m in the year to
September 30.
A sharp decline in insurance fee income and profit commission was offset by
a rise in other fees and commissions, and by substantially higher income at
Wise Speke, the stockbroking subsidiary, leaving overall turnover flat at
Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 33.2m.)
Fee income fell by 32 per cent to Pounds 9.86m reflecting a reduction in the
amount of insurance capacity managed by Sturge coupled with lower fee
scales. Similarly profit commission (paid by syndicates to the agency)
dropped by 29 per cent to Pounds 4.18m.
These declines were partly offset by an increase in other fees and
commissions to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 3.03m) but overall the insurance
agencies incurred a Pounds 3.44m operating loss on turnover of Pounds 18.6m,
compared with a Pounds 4.07m profit on turnover of Pounds 23.5m the previous
year.
In contrast Wise Speke reported record operating profits of Pounds 2.1m
(Pounds 100,000) with fees and commissions jumping by 54 per cent to Pounds
14.8m (Pounds 9.64m.)
Overall, the group reported a Pounds 1.32m operating loss compared with a
Pounds 4.14m operating profit the previous year. Net interest and other
income of Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 3.61m) helped the group edge back into
profits at the pre-tax level.
Earnings per share of 1.5p compared with 9.4p a year earlier. The final
dividend is cut to 2p (5.5p) making a total for the year of 3p (8.25p).
Mr David Coleridge, chairman, noted that the results represented 'a
significant fall,' but pointed out that the profit was struck after making
the further provision to cover Sturge's contribution to the Lloyd's offer to
Names.
Commenting on the outlook Mr Coleridge said: 'Whilst the profit outlook for
the group in the near future remains difficult, the prospects for Wise Speke
are good and the portents for the insurance agencies are more favourable'.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Confidence on future as Eldridge Pope
doubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Eldridge Pope rose 9p to 134p yesterday after the USM-traded
retailer, brewer and wine shipper announced near-doubled annual profits.
In an upbeat statement, Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said: 'A fundamental
restructuring is now being achieved . . . there are now considerably
brighter prospects for the company.'
The full benefits of the trading alliance with Carlsburg-Tetley will be felt
from the spring of next year, he said.
Although turnover dipped to Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 43.1m) in the 12 months to
September 30 - reflecting the disposal of the beer wholesaling business to
Carlsburg-Tetley in July - an 11 per cent upturn in operating profits,
coupled with sharply reduced inter-est charges, left the pre-tax line 95 per
cent higher at Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 901,000 restated for FRS 3).
The outcome took in a net surplus of Pounds 252,000 on the restructuring,
comprising a profit on sale of goodwill of Pounds 4m less a series of
write-offs and provisions.
The company is also writing down the balance sheet carrying value of its
main site in Dorchester by Pounds 2.6m, redu-cing total net assets to Pounds
57.6m, against Pounds 59.1m. Borrowings fell from Pounds 17m to Pounds
8.85m, leaving gearing at 15.4 per cent.
After a tax credit of Pounds 51,000 (Pounds 136,000), resulting from losses
and reliefs in previous years - set to continue for another two years at
least, Mr Pope said - earnings per share improved from 5p to 8.6p.
A proposed final dividend of 2.15p brings the total for the year to 3.55p
(3.25p). Mr Pope reiterated that 'restoring the dividend to its former level
and beyond is a top priority'.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Higher overseas sales help Tunstall rise to
Pounds 6.47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved overseas sales and continued reorganisation helped Tunstall Group,
the manufacturer of communication and security systems, increase pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 6.47m in the year to September 30.
The pre-tax figure for 1992 has been recalculated from Pounds 5.29m to
comply with the FRS 3 accounting standard.
The main impact of FRS 3 was to restate the 1992 figures to take account of
a Pounds 4.1m loss on discontinued operations and a Pounds 1.35m exceptional
profit.
Turnover on continuing operations improved from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds
44.8m, with income from overseas operations up 37 per cent to Pounds 10.5m
(Pounds 7.65m).
Mr Michael Dawson, chairman, said that the performance of Tunstall
International, the division handling overseas sales, had 'become
increasingly important in the development of our business'. The group's
policy of dividing its operations between eight trading companies enabled it
to cut costs and exploit new market opportunities, he added.
Stringent financial controls also bolstered Tunstall's bank balances, up to
Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 2.1m) in spite of substantial capital expenditure.
During the year, the group spent Pounds 1.6m on new product development,
Pounds 2.6m on upgrading its Yorkshire assembly plant and Pounds 500,000 on
the acquisition of Eses, the Spanish security company.
Further expenditure is also planned on Mion Electronics, a new subsidiary
set up last month to take over the design and manufacturing business of
Tunstall Electronics.
The group's positive performance, however, was hampered by a sharp decline
at Tunstall ComSystem, its German subsidiary. Pre-tax profits fell from
Pounds 272,000 to Pounds 59,000 as recession hit trading.
In a move to improve liquidity among such subsidiaries, the group announced
a 1-for-1 scrip issue of new ordinary shares at 5p.
The final dividend is raised to 4.5p (3.75p), making 7p. Earnings per share
rose from 21.6p to 26.5p.
Separately, Tunstall said yesterday it was seeking substantial damages over
the 1988 acquisition of Tann-Synchronome from Anchor Line.
Mr Dawson said the group spent Pounds 265,000 last year on legal costs. The
case, alleging faults in Tann-Synchronome's fire security products, is due
to be heard in June 1994.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wellman incurs loss of Pounds 527,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellman, the specialist engineer, swung from profits of Pounds 321,000 to
losses of Pounds 527,000 pre-tax for the six months to the end of September.
The deficit took account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 253,000,
being directors' compensation for loss of office.
A 26 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds 9.87m resulted from the timing
of contract deliveries at the furnace and process engineering companies.
The directors said second half sales would be higher as large contracts fell
due for delivery. Margins, however, would be lower. The order book at Pounds
17.5m was Pounds 6.5m higher than a year earlier.
Losses per share emerged at 1.8p, compared with earnings of 0.5p. As an
indication of confidence in future profitability the interim dividend is
held at 0.3p.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sims Food Pounds 1.3m in the red -
Livestock prices and sterling devaluation blamed for turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High livestock prices together with the devaluation of sterling pushed Sims
Food Group, the meat processor and supplier, Pounds 1.3m into the red at the
pre-tax level during the six months to September 30.
That compared with previous profits of Pounds 2.5m.
Sales were 3.2 per cent higher at Pounds 148.9m, including Pounds 8.2m from
acquisitions. Sims, which has seen its shares fall from 182p in June to last
night's 102p, cut its dividend by a third to 2p.
Mr John Stone, chairman, said the group's dire predictions about the state
of trading had proved 'all too accurate'.
Livestock prices had increased by between 18 and 30 per cent during the
first half, while Sims was only able to raise its prices to retail customers
by between 12 and 14 per cent.
However, Mr David Brady, finance director, said the situation had improved
substantially since September. A restructuring, for which Pounds 6.6m had
been provided last year, had been completed resulting in a significant
reduction in costs and capital employed in the business.
Sims also intended shortly to sell its stake in TS&amp;W, a meat importing
business, to management for a cash payment of about Pounds 4m.
The retail division, which had incurred substantial losses in the first six
months, had returned to profitability in the second half due to the
restructuring.
The strongest performance came from the manufacturing division, which
increased organic sales by 21 per cent. Mr Brady said the acquisition of
Oakland Fast Foods in July had exceeded expectations and Sims intended to
focus its investment in this division in the future.
Losses per share of 3p compared with previous earnings of 5.3p.
The group reported net debt of Pounds 21m, leaving borrowings representing
roughly 70 per cent of shareholders' funds.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: City's busiest month breaks records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of trading records were broken in the City last month amid
exceptional conditions in equity and gilts markets. The Pounds 110.5bn
turnover of UK and overseas stocks made it the busiest month ever for equity
trading in London.
Equity trading broke the previous record of Pounds 109.3bn set in August. A
total of Pounds 52.6bn was traded in UK equities, the busiest month since
July 1987, and it was the second busiest month for overseas equities, with
turnover of Pounds 57.9bn.
Figures from the Stock Exchange showed that November was also a record month
for new issues, with 42 companies joining the market, raising a total of
Pounds 1.8bn.
This brings the year's total to 158 companies, raising Pounds 5.1bn.
There were no new gilt issues during November, but turnover remained strong.
The month's turnover was Pounds 143.6bn, bringing the year's total to a
record Pounds 1,438bn.
Twelve of the new companies were Lloyds investment trusts, which raised
Pounds 758.9m, with an average market capitalisation of Pounds 82.9m. A
total of 17 companies were capitalised at Pounds 50m or less, raising Pounds
368.5m between them.
Seven companies were capitalised at over Pounds 100m. The largest was Elan
Corporation, capitalised at Pounds 892.3m, which came via the Unlisted
Securities Market.

Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, yesterday took majority
control of the football club by acquiring 500,000 shares from Mr Tony Berry,
former chairman of the Blue Arrow employment services group.
The transaction, announced following consultation with the Takeover Panel,
takes Mr Sugar's stake from 47 per cent to 50.1 per cent.
Mr Berry sold the shares at 100p each. He is a long-term ally of Mr Sugar,
who is also chairman of Amstrad.
The deal gives Mr Sugar 8.15m shares in the company, while Mr Berry's stake
has declined to 300,000.
Tottenham Hotspur said last night: 'The aggregate number of shares in which
Mr Berry and Mr Sugar - who are deemed to be acting in concert for the
purposes of the City code on takeovers and mergers - are interested remains
unchanged at 8.45m.'
Shares in the club remained unchanged yesterday at 105p.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perkins Foods warned yesterday that its profits would fall 'somewhat short'
of market expectations for the year ending December 31. The shares fell 8p
to close at 74p.
The company, which expects second half pre-tax profits to be similar to the
first half's Pounds 10.1m, also said it would be making exceptional
provisions of Pounds 4m for the closure of some loss-making operations.
However, it expects an improvement next year, and intends to maintain the
final dividend at 2.7p a share, which would give a total for the year of
4.45p (4.4p).
The company said that since the interim statement 'trading conditions have
deteriorated with poorer than anticipated sales and operating margins in
September and October'.
While the group was experiencing a seasonal improvement in demand,
'operating margins are expected tor remain under pressure.'
Last year pre-tax profits were 8.7 per cent down.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Trimmed Charter remainson acquisition trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charter, the industrial group, is still planning to make a substantial
acquisition but believes most quoted UK companies are currently looking
overvalued.
Mr Jeff Herbert, chief executive, said the group would be more likely to buy
a division from a multinational or look to parts of the world where
companies were on a lower rating. He wants to add an extra leg to Charter's
current portfolio, which supplies equipment to the mining and rail
industries, and building products, including quarrying.
Charter is on the acquisition trail after unwinding its links with Anglo
American Corporation, the South African mining group. Charter sold its 38
per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing
group, for Pounds 342m in February. It then then used part of the proceeds
to buy out a 36 per cent stake in Charter held by Minorco, Anglo American's
Luxembourg-based investment company.
Charter has net cash of Pounds 147m, and will receive another Pounds 42m in
1996, but Mr Herbert said the money was not burning a hole in his pock-et.
'We intend to follow the advice of our top shareholders, who have told us
'be thorough, be patient, but get it right'.'
Charter's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 37.9m to Pounds 31.3m in the six
months to September 30, reflecting the Johnson Matthey disposal. However,
operating profits of continuing operations rose by 5 per cent to Pounds
19.5m on turnover of Pounds 288.4m (Pounds 262.2m).
Mr Herbert said: 'There have been some signs of recovery in our markets, but
conditions for our coal and materials businesses remain difficult. Taken as
a whole, we expect continued modest improvement from our operating
businesses.'
Earnings per share fell to 19.6p (23.2p), but the interim dividend is held
at 7p.
Charter said it had discovered historic misreporting of contracts in its
Cape insulation business in France, which had led to a write-off of Pounds
3.9m to reserves and the dismissal of the managers involved. An ind-ependent
review of contracts throughout Cape had shown it was an isolated incident.
COMMENT
Profits were a little higher than expected because of an exceptional gain of
Pounds 2.6m on the disposal of a limestone quarry, but Charter's shares
dropped from 731p to 719p as analysts pondered indications that both Pandrol
rail fasteners and Andersen mining equipment had an unusually strong first
half. The performance of the continuing businesses is respectable, given
market conditions, but interest in Charter focuses on its expansion plans.
The shares are on a 20 per cent premium to the market, reflecting the uplift
in earnings which should follow the investment of cash, and the earnings
enhancement caused by the buy-back of Minorco's shares. How the shares
perform from here will depend on the execution of the group's long-pondered
acquisition plans.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach gathers pace with 47% rise to
Pounds 8.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach, the acquisitive bus company that came to market last April,
yesterday announced a 47 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.8m in
the six months to October 16.
Turnover rose from Pounds 68.7m to Pounds 80.7m, excluding discontinued
operations. However, the latest figure included the contribution of several
acquisitions as well as new business generated by introducing modern coaches
 -shortly to be equipped with lap seat-belts - on some medium-distance
routes.
Mr Brian Souter, chairman, said Stagecoach was interested in the prospect of
acquiring one or more of the London bus companies when they were privatised
and believed the company could make acquisitions without calling on
shareholders for additional capital.
Stagecoach, which has 6 per cent of the UK bus market, believed that more
modern buses and better services could reverse the decline in bus travel.
Some cities in the south-east were introducing transport policies favouring
buses which had boosted demand.
The company was also a potential bidder for British Rail franchises though
it did not expect the shape of the future rail market to become much clearer
before the spring. It would be the end of 1994 before it took a final
decision on whether to bid, said Mr Brian Cox, a director.
Earnings per share for the opening half rose to 4.4p (3.3p). The company is
paying a 1.5p interim dividend and forecast a final of 2.5p.
Operating profit, excluding new acquisitions, rose 13 per cent to Pounds
10.5m reflecting increases in efficiency. It invested Pounds 22m in 256 new
buses. Interest charges on new buses are far lower than the cost of
maintaining old buses which can run to Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 6,000 a year.
When the company's five-year replacement programme is completed the average
age of the fleet will have fallen from 10 years to six years.
The group's gearing is currently standing at nearly 140 per cent because of
its recent acquisitions. However, it took comfort from the fact that its
interest cover was five times earnings, Mr Derek Scott, finance director,
said.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider rises to Pounds 11m -
Invasion of low-priced brands hits share of take-home market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taunton Cider, reporting an adjusted 11 per cent increase in first half
profits to Pounds 11m, said yesterday that the take-home cider market had
been invaded by an unprecedented number of low-priced brands.
Volume sales of economy products - which were undercutting private label
brands - surged 62 per cent in the six months to end-September to account
for most of the market growth.
Private label volumes had declined 13 per cent under intense competition
from the economy brands supplied by Belgian producers and smaller UK cider
makers, said Mr Peter Adams, Taunton's chief executive.
Though Taunton's premium packaged brands, such as Diamond White, Red Rock
and Brody, almost matched sector growth of 8 per cent, the reduction in its
private label sales left overall volumes slightly lower.
Mr Adams said that the company intended to protect its brands and strengthen
its position in the market. Brand promotion would be increased and, in
partnership with retail customers, reductions were planned in private label
prices. 'We believe we can maintain margins by cutting costs,' Mr Adams
said.
Taunton's pre-tax profits grew to Pounds 11m, against a reported Pounds 8m
or an adjusted Pounds 9.9m after taking out borrowings of Pounds 1.9m which
were repaid after flotation in July last year.
Earnings per share, also adjusted for the effect of flotation, grew 13 per
cent to 6.9p (6.1p) - last year's actual earnings were 6.3p. The interim
dividend is raised 10 per cent to 2.65p (2.4p).
Operating profit was 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 10.8m on marginally higher
turnover of Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 65m).
Increased distribution in the pub trade lifted sales of Dry Blackthorn and
Autumn Gold, the mainstream draught brands. Draught volumes rose 6 per cent,
well ahead of the sector's overall 2 per cent growth, and gained market
share. Packaged cider sales through pubs, however, were 1 per cent lower.
Recently launched products, including Fres, a light cider, and Drum perry,
showed 'encouraging early signs,' said Mr Adams.
Discussions had begun with potential partners on developing overseas
opportunities and on adding premium beers to the company's drinks portfolio,
he added.
Capital spending on extending packaging facilities and technological
improvements amounted to Pounds 4.4m in the first half. The full year's
programme, aimed at reducing costs, is expected to total Pounds 10m.
COMMENT
Taunton has met some concerns by regaining share in the mainstream draught
cider market only to find a more serious problem developing in the take-home
sector. The growth of tertiary brands may prove more difficult to combat -
and scepticism about Taunton's ability to do so without further loss of
volume or damage to its margins is reflected in the downgrading of full year
profit forecasts from Pounds 22m to Pounds 20.7m. However, the cider market
remains buoyant, though growth is slowing to about 6 per cent; second half
sales are ahead; and a prospective p/e of 13 gives few hostages to fortune.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Star TV chief may bid for ITV company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Julian Mounter, former chief executive of Star TV, the Asian satellite
venture, is involved in a consortium looking seriously at acquiring an ITV
company.
It is believed that Mr Mounter, a former Thames Television executive who
went on to make a success of running Television New Zealand, is providing
the television expertise for a weighty consortium.
The members of the consortium have not yet become public, but it is believed
that they include a substantial UK company which would like to enter the
television market and a company from the European Union.
All the signs are that for the right deal the consortium has already lined
up the finances to buy any of the free-standing ITV companies.
Mr Mounter, who is at the moment in Hong Kong, declined to comment yesterday
other than to emphasise that the UK television market was just one of the
prospects he was looking at.
It is thought unlikely that the consortium plans an early intervention in
either of the two takeover deals already under way - Carlton Communication's
agreed bid for Central Independent Television or Granada's contested bid for
London Weekend Television.
The available targets to such an outside consortium, probably after January
1 when the barriers to takeovers of ITV companies become lower, would
include Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, Anglia Television and HTV.
An international outside investor might take the view that the present
government proposals to allow one ITV company to hold two franchises,
however large (apart from London), are only the first stage in the
liberalisation of commercial television. The rules will be debated in the
House of Commons today and in the House of Lords next Monday.
Under such an argument it would make sense to acquire an ITV company quite
soon, even a middle ranking one, and hope that further expansion is possible
at a later date.
The consortium being advised by Mr Mounter, who left Star soon after Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation bought a controlling interest, is also
looking at the possibility of bidding for a Channel 5 licence.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: AB Engineering back in black after overseas
lift
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated British Engineering turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 106,000
for the half year to September 30, against a Pounds 46,000 loss last time.
The result was struck after an increase in pension fund contributions to
Pounds 93,236, against Pounds 24,000 last time which reflected a surplus on
the fund.
All group businesses showed depressed conditions in the UK, but improved in
overseas markets. Diesel power engineering turned round from Pounds 99,000
losses to Pounds 161,000 profits, but catering equipment losses rose to
Pounds 223,000 (Pounds 49,000). Earnings were 0.02p (0.04p losses).
The company is acquiring from the Leyland Daf receivers certain assets of a
business specialising in the rebuilding and reconditioning of diesel
engines.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Midlands boosts sector with 34% lift -
Differing reactions to results of two regional electricity companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midlands Electricity yesterday gave the electricity sector a fillip when it
announced a 20 per cent increase in the interim dividend and indicated that
the full year rise would be about 15 per cent.
The move, accompanied by an announcement that pre-tax profits for the six
months to September 30 rose 34 per cent from a restated Pounds 66.7m to
Pounds 89.5m, produced a 22p rise in its shares which ended the day at 675p.
Other shares in the sector rose on the expectation that the remaining
regional electricity companies would also announce dividend rises above
expectations.
Turnover was higher at Pounds 625.5m, compared with Pounds 660.7m. The
dividend of 7.65p (6.35p) was paid from earnings per share of 30.1p (22.6p).
The company also announced a Pounds 10 rebate to quarterly billed customers
payable from January 1994. Together with the earlier reduction this would
give a price reduction for the full year of 7 per cent for the average
domestic customer.
Midlands said total units distributed rose 2.3 per cent, with industrial
sales up 1.6 per cent. 'The revival in demand has been led by the region's
manufacturing sector,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman.
Commercial sales rose 1.7 per cent and there was 3.8 per cent growth in
domestic sales.
Profits from distribution profits rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 66.4m,
against Pounds 61.2m, and the supply side increased from Pounds 9.6m to
Pounds 17.6m.
The restatement of the accounts stems from a change in coal contracts and is
to 'enable the supply business cost of sales to be more closely matched with
the relevant turnover'.
Mr Mike Hughes, chief executive, said he expected a reduction of 400 in the
workforce of the core business during the year leaving a total of 5,400
employees at the year end.
In non-core activities, retailing made a loss of Pounds 500,000, against
profits of Pounds 1m last year. The company said this was affected by
start-up costs of joining the E&amp;S joint venture with two other regional
electricity companies.
'There is no reason why the bigger business cannot make a profit but
retailing will probably make a small loss this year,' said Mr Hughes.
The generation business incurred a slightly smaller operating loss of Pounds
1.2m (Pounds 1.4m) as a result of development costs. The company's policy is
to write off all costs as they occur when developing businesses abroad.
The company is involved in potential generation projects in Turkey and China
where its policy is to be an 'informed investor' typically with a 30 per
cent stake in a project.
COMMENT
The market was no doubt pleased with Midlands' optimistic comments on the
state of the local economy but what really impressed it was its statement
that it had achieved a 'proper balance' between the interests of
shareholders and customers. Midlands may be pressing the accelerator on
profits and therefore on dividends but, the market reasons, the rebate
should help it to soothe the regulator when he looks at price controls in
the distribution review. Another plus for Midlands is that it is has the
ability, if it needs to, to claw back a fair chunk of the Pounds 33m from
customers because of previous under-recovery in tariffs. If the total
dividend for the year is 22.95p, and the company suggested yesterday that
figure was a reasonable expectation, the prospective yield is 4.3 per cent,
about average for the recs. However, the shares may struggle to achieve a
higher rating because of concerns over the company's exposure to gas and its
overseas ambitions.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: 3i demonstrates 'robust portfolio' with 10%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i, the UK's largest investment capital provider, yesterday reported a 10
per cent increase in net assets to 618p per share in the six months to
September 30.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said the improvement demonstrated 3i
had a 'robust underlying portfolio' and provided a 'strong indication of the
financial performance of the sector in which we operate'.
The group is to pay an interim dividend of 4.7p (3.3p) to its shareholders,
the UK clearing banks and the Bank of England. The 42 per cent rise brings
the interim back in line with recent increases in the final dividend which
have not been matched at the interim stage, the group said.
The total return - a combination of dividend revenue less costs and net
interest, realised investment profits and the appreciation of the unrealised
portfolio - was Pounds 151m compared with a fall of Pounds 73.8m in the
first half of 1992.
Pre-tax revenue rose from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 37.6m helped by a swing in
the interest line from a net charge of Pounds 11.3m to a Pounds 2.4m credit.
Two indications of the improved welfare of the smaller companies that 3i
serves came from the dividend earned figure and the level of provisions.
Dividend income rose from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 51.4m and net provisions
fell from Pounds 46.9m to Pounds 19.2m. Mr Larcombe said the lower
provisions level showed 'the underlying portfolio is no longer
deteriorating.'
Within the total return, revenue rose from Pounds 16m to Pounds 28.2m,
partly reflecting the recovery in dividends, but also a reduced interest
bill as the flow of new investments slowed. Mr Brian Larcombe, finance
director, said the deal flow had begun to pick up again four months ago.
The group made after tax realised investment profits of Pounds 30.6m,
compared with losses of Pounds 16.2m including provisions, in the first half
last year. This equated to realisation profit over cost of Pounds 62.1m,
against Pounds 35.8m in the comparable period of 1992.
3i invested Pounds 138m in 264 investments in the period, compared with
Pounds 200m in 414 projects in the first half of last year.
Shareholders' funds were up from Pounds 1.19bn to Pounds 1.48bn.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Templeton net assets improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The buoyant state of world stock markets helped Templeton Emerging Markets
Investment Trust increase its net asset value by 38.9 per cent in the six
months to end-October.
Emerging markets are developing countries where economic growth is expected
to be higher, and the prospect for corporate earnings better, than in the
developed world. Templeton runs the largest investment trust in the sector.
Fully diluted net asset value was 343.57p on October 29, compared with
247.3p on April 30 and 214.23p a year earlier. As is the trust's policy,
there is no interim dividend.
Mr Mark Mobius, the trust's managing director, said 'Emerging markets have
shared in the generalised rise in worldwide share prices over the past year
with some markets, such as Turkey and Brazil, showing remarkable rises. We
continue to find bargains in a wide range of markets.'
The current geographical split of the trust's portfolio is as follows
(percentages in brackets): Brazil (17.7), Turkey (16.2), Philippines (11.4),
Hong Kong (8.5), Indonesia (6), Portugal (5.9), Greece (5.8), Malaysia
(5.7), Mexico (5.3), Singapore (4), South Korea (2.7), Argentina (1.2),
Chile (1) and others (3.3). The trust also has 5.3 per cent of its assets in
cash.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Swalec ahead but dividend disappoints City
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Wales Electricity yesterday unveiled an 18 per cent rise in interim
pre-tax profits to Pounds 44.4m from a re-stated Pounds 37.6m and said it
was increasing the dividend from 6.6p to 7.5p.
The 13.6 per cent dividend rise was less than both Eastern Electricity and
Midlands, the only other regional electricity companies to report so far
this season, and Swalec was the only rec to see its shares fall on the day.
Earnings per share for the half year to September 30 advanced by 19 per cent
to 31p (26p).
Swalec increased turnover from continuing businesses from Pounds 259.8m to
Pounds 274.7m. Cost of sales rose to Pounds 172m (Pounds 163m) and operating
costs amounted to Pounds 64.1m (Pounds 62.4m).
Operating profits in the distribution side grew by 10 per cent to Pounds
32.9m.
Electricity distributed was up overall by 1.7 per cent, with domestic usage
up 2 per cent and commercial by 0.9 per cent. Industrial customers took 1.5
per cent more with large industrial customers leading the way.
Supply profits at Pounds 2.1m were unchanged after last year's figures were
restated to reflect seasonal volume patterns.
Celtic, the company's contracting arm, contributed Pounds 200,000 to profits
against last year's first half losses of Pounds 700,000.
Staffing fell by 2 per cent in the half year to 2,534.
Mr David Jones, departing chief executive, said that further small
reductions would be likely for the rest of the year.
COMMENT
The City likes cautious utilities, but not, judging by the reaction to its
results, when they are as cautious as Swalec. The rec was giving little away
yesterday, either in information about the company, or by comparison with
other recs, in the dividend. Its shares, down 2p to 699p, are on a yield of
about 4.5 per cent if the company pays out 25.4p for the full year. The
prospective yield is among the highest of the recs and reflects the concerns
about the company's recent expansion in contracting. Swalec may rise in the
ratings list when Mr Andrew Walker, formerly of TI and Dowty, gets his feet
under the table, and when and if it can demonstrate the telecommunications
diversification is a winner. But there is nothing immediately to suggest a
re-rating.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the Anglo-US industrial group, could raise up to Dollars 245m gross
from the flotation of Beazer Homes USA, its US house building subsidiary,
according to the prospectus filed yesterday with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission in Washington.
The group plans to offer 6m shares in Beazer Homes USA at between Dollars
17.50 and Dollars 20 a share and Dollars 125m of senior notes due 2004.
It had announced with its year-end results last week its intention to float
off its Beazer subsidiaries in the US and UK.
Sale of the US and UK businesses, acquired in 1991, could raise more than
Pounds 400m.
Hanson's activities include gold mining, chemicals, material handling,
tobacco, forest products and lumber.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Inspirations group to be listed on USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tour operating sector acquired its third quoted company yesterday with
the placing of 28.3 per cent of the shares of Inspirations, the holiday
company.
The company is to be listed on the Unlisted Securities Market, with dealings
expected to begin on December 13.
The two other quoted companies involved purely in the package holiday
business are Airtours and Owners Abroad, the second and third largest tour
operators. The holiday market leader, Thomson, is a Canadian-controlled
public company, but also has extensive media interests.
Mr Vic Fatah, Inspirations' chief executive, was the founder of Sunmed
Holidays, which merged with the tour operating arm of British Airways in
1987 to create Redwing Holidays. Redwing was sold to Owners Abroad in 1990.
The placing by stockbrokers Beeson Gregory values the company at Pounds 23m.
The company said the placing was twice subscribed.
In the 11 months to September 30, Inspirations made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.5m on Pounds 118.4m turnover. The company carried 166,700 people
during the period. In the year to October 31 1992, pre-tax profits were
Pounds 749,000 on turnover of Pounds 49.7m.
The company sells holidays under the Inspirations and Style brands. It also
has a retail arm with five travel agency outlets. Under an agreement reached
last May, AT Mays, the UK's fourth largest travel retail chain, manages the
chains.
Inspirations has undertaken to acquire or start up a minimum of 50 retail
outlets by the end of next year. It also has an airline seat broking
business.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke cancels scrip dividend after
shares fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke, the leisure and hotels group, yesterday cancelled its alternative
scrip dividend in light of a sharp decline in its share price in the last
month.
The offer to pay shareholders in equity instead of a 4.92p cash dividend was
conditional on a market price of more than 151p per share at the close of
business on Monday.
About 6 per cent of shareholders, owed dividends totalling Pounds 3.5m, had
elected to receive shares.
Ladbroke's shares, which were 174p on November 8 when the offer was made,
closed at 148p on Monday. They fell further last night to 145 1/2 p.
The announcement follows recent controversy over Ladbroke's dividend policy.
The leisure group was last week believed to have retreated on an earlier
decision to take advantage of the foreign income dividend (FID) scheme when
making its 1993 final payout.
FIDs are perceived to be detrimental to Ladbroke's pension fund investors,
which benefit from tax credits on normal dividends but not on foreign income
payouts.
This, along with a substantial share sale by a senior executive last month,
is thought to have contributed to the recent fall in Ladbroke's share price.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Chubb Security advances 37% - Outcome
boosted by cost controls and defence of market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chubb Security, the electronic alarm and locks group, yesterday announced a
37 per cent increase to Pounds 34.2m in pre-tax profits for the six months
to October 8.
The increase, achieved on turnover up from Pounds 338m to Pounds 355.1m, was
due mainly to tight cost controls and success in defending market share
since the demerger last year from Racal.
Turnover, however, would have been almost flat had it not been for Pounds
9.5m generated by exchange rate movements and changes in accounting policies
for currency translation.
Beneficial exchange rates also contributed Pounds 1.1m to operating profits,
up from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 35.3m.
The policy change involves translating turnover and profits from Chubb's
extensive overseas operation at an average exchange rate during the half
year, rather than by the prevailing rate at the end of the accounting
period.
Earnings per share rose from 4.75p to 7.08p, and the interim dividend is 2p
(1.5p).
Mr David Peacock, chief executive, said: 'In spite of the worldwide
recession and provided present trading conditions do not worsen, prospects
for the full year are expected to be satisfactory.'
He also emphasised his determination to press ahead with the second phase of
a cost-cutting programme which has already resulted in Pounds 23m in savings
since mid-1992.
The programme is designed to increase Chubb's operating margins and share of
a worldwide market estimated at Pounds 7bn. It has already begun to refocus
its operations with cutbacks in administrative staff and increased emphasis
on a larger sales force.
Cutbacks in administrative staff were largely to blame for Pounds 1.9m in
redundancy costs, although this was down sharply on a Pounds 5.7m charge at
the half year stage last time.
As part of the rationalisation, Chubb said it had introduced 13 new products
in the period, with seven more planned before the year end.
Most of the new products are aimed at increasing the market share for the
group's electronic security division.
Turnover in the division increased from Pounds 170.3m to Pounds 178.2m in
the half year. Operating profits also increased to Pounds 17.9m, compared
with Pounds 14.9m last time.
In the physical security division - manufacturing locks, safes and fire
extinguishers - turnover rose from Pounds 167.8m to Pounds 176.9m.
Operating profits came in at Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 12.1m).
Improved cashflow, meanwhile, of Pounds 13.1m turned net debt of Pounds 4.8m
at the year end in March into net cash of Pounds 8.3m at the half way stage.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BAe scales back talks on sale of Dutch arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks on the sale of Ballast Nedam, British Aerospace's Dutch construction
subsidiary, are to be scaled back after BAe and Boskalis, the Dutch dredging
company, failed to reach agreement on a full takeover.
Boskalis, which had said in October that it was prepared to pay about Fl
500m (Pounds 177m) for Ballast Nedam, will continue to discuss other forms
of co-operation with Ballast Nedam short of outright acquisition.
BAe said it still intended to sell Ballast Nedam. 'Discussions will continue
with Boskalis on a non-exclusive basis with the possibility of other parties
becoming involved in these or other negotiations,' it said.
Boskalis's exclusive rights to negotiate a Ballast Nedam deal expired on
December 1. The three companies would not say why a takeover had not proved
to be possible. BAe said there had been no material change in Ballast
Nedam's financial position since the negotiations began.
Boskalis, which had earlier announced plans for a Fl 300m share issue to
help pay for the acquisition, said it was now calling off the share issue.
The failure of the merger talks renews uncertainty about Ballast Nedam's
future. Earlier this year Ballast Nedam's chairman resigned after BAe turned
down his plan for a flotation on the Amsterdam stock exchange.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Allied Colloids drops to Pounds 19m as
higher costs bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Allied Colloids, the chemicals company, fell 10p to 228p yesterday
as pre-tax profits for the six months to October 2 dropped 15 per cent from
Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 19m.
While the fall was predicted at the AGM in August, it turned out to be
greater than expected. The company blamed exchange rate movements and other
increased costs, including insurance.
Overhead costs rose by about 16 per cent. The insurance premium rose from
Pounds 1.5m a year to Pounds 5m following a fire at Bradford in July. The
costs of defending patents also increased.
Sales rose by 17 per cent from Pounds 136.3m to Pounds 159.3m. However,
about 10 per cent of the increase was accounted for by the change in
exchange rates following the UK's departure from the ERM.
The company increased sales in all areas apart from the UK, which accounts
for about 15 per cent of group turnover.
Sales in North America grew to Pounds 52m (Pounds 44.4m) and in Asia to
Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 12.5m). European sales improved to Pounds 53.8m (Pounds
45.5m), but the company reported continuing difficulties in Germany.
Sterling devaluation hit the cost of petrochemicals and other raw materials,
many of which are priced in D-Marks. The company had been unable to recover
this in selling prices.
The second half is expec-ted to be better as exchange rate benefits emerge
as a result of hedging curren-cies.
The company also said that raw material prices had stabilised, and it
expected a modest improvement in margins.
Earnings per share fell to 4.99p from 5.47p. The in-terim dividend is
increased from 0.94p to 1p.
COMMENT
The City, disappointed that the first half had come in below Pounds 20m,
yesterday downgraded its full year forecasts from Pounds 50m. It is now
expecting pre-tax profits to be about Pounds 44m - roughly equal to last
year. This implies a much better second half as about Pounds 5m flows in
through currency benefits. While sales continue to show strong growth, the
rise in costs gives some cause for concern. On the latest forecasts the
shares are on a prospective p/e of almost 20, a good premium to the market.
The company cannot afford any further slippage in margins.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Placing values Nelson Hurst at Pounds 63.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Nelson Hurst, the insurance broker which is coming to market via a
placing and intermediaries offer, were priced yesterday at 140p valuing the
group, which specialises in professional indemnity in east Asia and Latin
America, at Pounds 63.3m.
Nelson Hurst was the subject of a management buy-out from Citicorp, its
former owner, in May 1991 and the flotation is designed to give the group,
which is raising Pounds 30.6m through the issue, greater financial
flexibility.
Of the 25.2m shares on offer, 17.9m are being placed firm with institutional
investors by Charterhouse Bank, which has underwritten the issue. A further
7.37m shares have been placed subject to clawback to meet retail demand
through intermediaries.
The group is forecasting operating profits of not less than Pounds 7.2m and
pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 5.19m for the year to December 31.
On the basis of a notional tax rate of 33 per cent, pro-forma forecast
earnings per share for the current year are 10p, and the p/e at the issue
price is 14.
COMMENT
son Hurst's offer price represents a modest discount to the market and other
recent issues. This reflects concern over possible market indigestion rather
than any uncertainty about the group's profit potential. Nelson Hurst is an
international player with strengths in specialist product areas.

FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exploration decline hits Oceonics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased competition, particularly in the face of a decline in oil
exploration activity in the North Sea, hit Oceonics, the survey services
group, hard in the first half.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September fell from Pounds 1.77m
to Pounds 222,000.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 13.2m, mainly as a result of
the absence of a large offshore construction project.
Losses of 0.2p per share compared with earnings of 0.5p.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Shares in Siebe fall despite 17% gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Siebe, the inter-national controls and engineering group, fell 20p
to 566p yesterday although the company announced a 17 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 94.2m in the six months to September 30.
The shares enjoyed a strong run before the results. There was disappointment
that Pounds 10m of the Pounds 14m increase in pre-tax profits came from
currency translation, and concern about the impact of recession in
continental Europe and Japan.
However, Mr Barrie Stephens, Siebe's chairman and chief executive, was
upbeat: 'These results are particularly gratifying at a time when many of
the market places in which we trade are in recession.
'They also demonstrate the wisdom of building up our presence in the
fast-growing process controls sector and in this regard our United States
operations are especially important.'
Group turnover rose 18 per cent to Pounds 895m, of which Pounds 118m was
attributable to currency translation, and earnings per share advanced 16.2
per cent to 13.6p (11.7p). The interim dividend was lifted by 10 per cent to
3.66p (3.3275p).
Sales grew 2.7 per cent in constant currency terms and net margins were
maintained at 10.5 per cent, in spite of the impact of a Pounds 2m US
healthcare charge, which will continue at a similar level, and an increase
in severance charges from Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m, for redundancies in
continental Europe.
Siebe's worst performer was its specialist mechanical engineering. Sales in
automotive and garage equipment to continental Europe fell 19 per cent, and
profits fell from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 4.8m. This division bore most of
Siebe's 400 job losses.
In controls, operating profits increased from Pounds 78.4m to Pounds 96.7m.
Temperature and appliance controls benefited from the recovery in the US and
South America. Control systems increased sales, with gains in the US and
Asia offsetting lower activity in Europe and Canada.
An increase in cashflow from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 44.4m helped cut gearing
from 60 per cent at the April year-end to 56.2 per cent at September 30. Mr
Stephens said Eckardt, the recent German acquisition, would fit well with
the group's Foxboro process control business.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Bemrose buys US calendar publisher for Dollars 27m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1. Bemrose to buy:
Bemrose Corp., the Derby security and promotional printer, is to pay Dollars
27m (Pounds 17.9m) cash for McCleery-Cumming, the second largest US
publisher of advertising calendars.
2. Playboy to religion:
Styles range from religous subjects, scenic wildlife and American art to
'Playboy' glamour calendars.
3. Geo. Washington bedrock:
Two-thirds of sales are generated from the 'George Washington' range of
calendars sold through more than 3,000 independent US distributors.
4. Blue chip:
The balance of sales are customer-specific designs produced for large
commercial customers like Ford, General Motors, John Deer, Wal-Mart and
Texaco.
5. Selling out:
Four of McCleary-Cumming's management team own the majority of the company's
shares. Selling to Bemrose, they will retire as multi-millionaires. 'Quote
to come: we only did it for the grandchildren'.
6. Printing profits:
It posted pre-tax profits of Dollars 5.05m in the year to February, up from
Dollars 4.45m a year earlier, on sales of Dollars 31.8m (Dollars 32.5m.) Net
assets at the end of February were Dollars 8.49m.
7. 90 years young:
The McCleery-Cumming calendar business started in 1903 and expanded by
buiyng the calendar division of Newman Rudolf of Chicago in 1944.
8. A chunk of 'Hawkeye' state on the Skunk
The company, which employs up to 350 people including 200 staff who work
seasonally. It has a 20-acre site on the Skunk River in Washington, Iowa.
9. Shareholders tapped:
Bemrose will fund the deal with a 1-for-4 rights issue at 325p per share,
underwritten by SG Warburg, to raise a net Pounds 19.5m. The shares closed
up xp at 3xxp yesterday.
10. Bemrose booms:
Bemrose forecasts pre-tax profits, before exceptional credits, of at least
Pounds 10m (Pounds 6.25m) in the year to January 1, for earnings per share
of 27.90p (22.18p).
11. 'Excellent fit':
Mr Roger Booth, Bemrose's chief executive, said the acquisition was 'an
outstanding opportunity'. Bemrose, already number three in the US market,
moves a whisker shy of number one slot. The deal will ehance earnings in
1994.
12. Make-up-your-mind time:
The deal is subject to shareholder approval at an extraodinary meeting on
December 23.

<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank's 11 per cent increase in operating profits for the 10 months
ended October to DM4.2bn (Pounds 1.66bn) came exclusively from foreign
operations, Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman said yesterday.
Record group-wide risk provisions of almost DM2.5bn, up 54 per cent on last
year, led to a fall in earnings at the German-based parent of 9 per cent to
DM2.36bn, he said. Some 90 per cent of the provisions, which he expected to
rise to almost DM3bn for the full year, were to cover domestic risks.
The German recession had now caught up with the banks, Mr Kopper told a
press conference, and its effects would continue to be felt in the new year.
Providing for risks was a 'recession barometer, and right now it is showing
a storm warning,' he declared.
The cyclical and structural crisis had had a serious impact on the
credit-worthiness and income of Deutsche's domestic customers, Mr Kopper
warned. 'As the house bank to thousands of small and medium-sized companies,
we are feeling the effects of this,' he said.
The bottom of the industrial recession had been reached. 'But the bad news
is that we will stay quite a while at this low point,' he added.
Deutsche, Germany's biggest private sector bank, also holds 10 per cent or
more of the equity of 25 leading non-banking companies, worth almost DM24bn,
according to details released for the first time yesterday.
These holdings include 10.65 per cent in Metallgesellschaft, the metals,
mining and engineering group.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Why pension funds are glum at the bull market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the midst of roaring bull markets we are suddenly confronted with the
curious spectacle of distressed pension funds, on both sides of the
Atlantic. Rising securities prices can imply lower future returns, so they
bring no comfort at all to those who are seeking to pay for future
liabilities from investments made out of future cash flows, or from the
roll-over, at maturity, of existing fixed income securities into future
issues at lower interest rates.
The better-known sob story is that of the big US corporations anxiously
tracking the long Treasury bond yield. General Motors has said that each
percentage point drop adds Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) to its pension
deficit, which is probably now more than Dollars 20bn.
There is a rather less publicised debate going on in the UK amongst
actuaries about the impact of the minimum solvency standard proposed by the
Goode Committee. Some fear it may trigger a shift of strategy by British
funds away from 90 per cent equities and towards a much heavier bond
exposure.
The discontinuance basis of valuation has returned to prominence; it forms a
fragile link between rising equity prices and slumping bond yields. A
similar problem is aggravating the US crisis, because of the attempts by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Securities and Exchange
Commission to tighten valuation rules. Many US plans are undervaluing their
liabilities by applying unrealistically high discount rates.
If schemes are terminated, they need to contain enough assets to provide the
promised benefits. The most conservative test of solvency on this basis is
whether there is enough money to buy the required annuities from life
assurance companies. In the UK, not only have the gilt yields which underpin
annuity rates dropped by 2 percentage points so far this year but life
companies are offering exceptionally poor rates because they are suffering
from balance sheet strains.
Hitherto, British pension schemes have tended to regard their American
counterparts with slightly patronising sympathy because of the latter's need
to cope with unhelpful rules. The US pensions accounting standard FAS 87
focuses on the market values of assets and has thus encouraged a high bond
element in portfolios, aiming at low volatility.
The equivalent UK standard SSAP24 permits smoothed actuarial valuations, so
that a dive in the stock market can be made to disappear by fancy figuring.
British funds have gone confidently for the high equity returns (19 per cent
a year since 1979) and have prospered.
But now they face two awkward problems. The stringent solvency test is
around the corner, unless the actuarial profession can mount a rescue.
Second, the latest surge in equity prices has been based largely on the
stretching of the valuation basis rather than on improved fundamentals. So
the actuarial smoothing, based upon dividend growth, has temporarily gone
into reverse: thanks to Norman Lamont's raid on pension funds' dividend tax
relief in March, the actuarial valuations this year will show a slight fall
in UK equities.
The Goode Committee suggested that one way in which the problem of a minimum
solvency standard could be moderated would be through the issue of special
gilts by the government. These would be deferred income index-linked bonds,
and would partly get around the problem of unacceptably poor annuity rates.
However, each terminated scheme would have a different liability profile.
Actuaries are now telling the Bank of England that in an ideal world the
government would issue a whole series of zero coupon index-linked gilts with
a long spread of maturity dates. It would then be possible for each fund to
put together a package of zeros, maturing in different years, which would
closely match its expected pension liabilities. Each zero being attractive
to many different funds, it would be a reasonably liquid investment.
The irony is that the British and American governments see themselves as
successful in driving down their cost of borrowing, but now they are faced
with the troubles of pension schemes which have based their funding on the
expectation that investment returns would be high. One thing leads to
another . . .

FT  08 DEC 93 / Smith New Court up 400%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant equity markets in London and overseas helped Smith New Court raise
interim profits to Pounds 31.3m, against Pounds 6.7m, the securities house
disclosed yesterday.
The rise, confirmation of the exceptional profits generated by securities
houses this year, prompted a doubling of the interim dividend to 2p despite
the firm's policy of only adjusting the dividend at the year end. Diluted
earnings per share rose to 25p, against 6.1p. Sir Michael Richardson,
chairman, said the opening few weeks of the second half had shown a
continuation of business levels.
The disclosure of Smith New Court's profits coincided with figures from the
stock exchange showing that November was the busiest month ever for equity
trading in London, with a stock turnover value of Pounds 110.5bn.
Smith New Court's short-term borrowings to finance equity marketmaking
positions were reduced by the firm's access to extra capital. It completed a
Pounds 45.1m rights issue in August to finance expansion.
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, said that earnings had been evenly split
between marketmaking, its core business from its roots as a jobber, and fees
from corporate and institutional broking into which it had diversified.
He said that more than 60 per cent of revenues had come from overseas,
including broking and marketmaking in Asia Pacific and New York. The firm
saw 'huge opportunities' in India, China and Latin America.
Despite the increase in bonuses expected at securities houses, he said that
expenses from existing staff had 'risen like everything else, but not
exploded'. The company has recruited 60 more staff since last year, bringing
it to 1,360.
Capital and reserves rose from Pounds 92.3m to Pounds 175.3m, helping to
finance the sharp rise in assets held on the balance sheet of Pounds 4.62bn,
against Pounds 2.66bn. Current liabilities to fund the equity book positions
rose from Pounds 4.43bn to Pounds 2.55bn.
The firm expects an appeal in a legal dispute with Citicorp about the sale
of Ferranti to be resolved 'shortly'. It is holding the principal and
interest involved as a result of the original judgement, and could benefit
by Pounds 14m.
Shares closed 11p down at 411p. The two for seven rights issue price in June
was 210p.

FT  08 DEC 93 / SW Bell in cable link-up with Cox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Southwestern Bell, the US regional telecommunications group, and Cox
Enterprises, the privately-owned media group, yesterday formed the latest
multi-media alliance in the US when Southwestern agreed to invest Dollars
1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in a partnership which will own most of Cox's cable
television systems.
The deal follows a UK partnership between the two last spring when Cox took
a 25 per cent stake in a cable television and telephone system run by
Southwestern.
Mr James Robbins, who heads Cox's cable business, said that 'after looking
at many potential partners we realised the best match was with our existing
partner in the UK'.
Southwestern Bell, one of the seven Baby Bell local telephone companies,
provides telecommunications services in Texas and neighbouring states.
Atlanta-based Cox is a Dollars 2.5bn turnover media group with interests
ranging from newspapers to television broadcasting stations.
Under a memorandum of understanding, Southwestern will take a 40 per cent
stake in the private US partnership, which will own 21 of Cox's cable
systems, with about 1.6m subscribers in 16 states. The combined venture will
have a market value of around Dollars 4.9bn and will be the sixth or seventh
largest cable operator in the US.
The partnership will exclude two Cox cable systems, in Oklahoma City and
Lubbock, Texas, because Southwestern Bell provides a telephone service
there. US law forbids telephone companies from owning cable businesses in
their telecommunications service area.
Cox has offered to place in the partnership various other cable interests,
subject to separate negotiations. These could include a Dollars 500m
investment Cox has agreed to make in QVC, the television home shopping
network, to finance its hostile Dollars 10bn bid for Paramount, the US film
and publishing group.
The Cox deal is the latest example of US local telephone and cable companies
forming alliances in preparation for the growth of a multi-media home
entertainment industry.
Cox and Southwestern said much of the telephone company's Dollars 1.6bn
investment would help 'aggressively expand cable subscribership' and acquire
interests in programming.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Accounting tricks fool many City analysts, says study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of their telephone number salaries, many City analysts have proved
incapable of understanding company accounts, according to an academic study
released yesterday.
Just a handful of analysts could see through the most elementary forms of
creative accounting in a test of their scrutiny of financial statements.
Leading City institutions have had to toughen up their accounting skills
considerably since the study was conducted at the end of the bull market in
1990.
The research was conducted on 63 experienced investment analysts at five
City stockbrokers by Mr Gaetan Breton from the University of Quebec in
Montreal and Professor Richard Taffler from the City University Business
School in London.
Of 1,325 possible corrections they could have made in calculating financial
ratios from a set of accounts full of 'window-dressing', just 34 adjustments
were made in total. Fifty-two analysts made no corrections.
But two-thirds of analysts said they had seen window-dressing in the
accounts and 61 per cent believed, most incorrectly, that they had made the
adjustments to remove these effects. Window-dressing schemes used were
extraordinary items, deferred taxation, non-capitalisation of leased assets,
creating profit via asset disposals, non-consolidated subsidiaries,
non-subsidiary subsidiaries, pension contribution holidays, merger
accounting and hidden interest charges.
Prof Taffler said he believed the quality of accounting understanding may
have improved since the study was conducted.
Mr Chris Clark, head of research at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'In the
last two to three years, more people have realised their accounting
knowledge is inadequate. I suspect everybody knows they need to raise their
operating standards.'
He said the annual Extel ratings of City analysts 'have created a lot of
highly-paid prima donnas' who resist improving their financial
understanding. 'When I joined in 1989 the quality of accounting
understanding was abysmal. I now look for analysts who are accountants.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Lonrho drops Lockerbie film: Board persuaded not to co-fund
controversial documentary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho, the international conglomerate, has withdrawn financial backing from
a controversial film about the Lockerbie bombing, which it is co-financing
with Libya.
Mr Stephen Walls and Mr Peter Harper, two of Lonrho's newly-appointed
non-executives, persuaded the Lonrho board to end its involvement in the
film. They are also expected to press for Lonrho to withdraw from further
co-operation with Libya, which owns a third of Lonrho's Metropole Hotels
subsidiary.
Mr Dieter Bock, the German joint chief executive, was also keen to abandon
the film project, which had been started on the initiative of Mr Tiny
Rowland, his fellow joint chief executive.
However, Mr Allan Francovich, the film's producer, said yesterday he had not
been informed by Lonrho of its withdrawal of a Pounds 633,000 contribution
to the film. He added: 'I am not going to be stopped (from completing the
film) by anyone'. He said he had insisted there should be no interference
from Libya or Lonrho in the content of the film and that he had uncovered
new evidence about who carried out the 1988 bombing, which resulted in 270
deaths.
The United Nations recently froze Libyan assets held abroad to increase
pressure on it to hand over for trial in the west suspects accused of
blowing up the Pan Am airliner.
Mr Rowland, however, yesterday said he and Mr Bock were 'at one' on the
Libyan issue. While the board had decided to stop the financing of the film
'for the time being', he said that work already completed was of commercial
value to Lonrho. He recently said that Lonrho was ready to complete deals
worth hundreds of millions of pounds with Libya if the documentary film
showed it to be innocent of the Lockerbie bombing.
Mr Rowland is now satisfied that the Libyans were not involved in the
bombing. 'There was no sign of their involvement at all. If there had been
any evidence . . . we would have handed it over to the British government,'
he said.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Delors to oppose labour deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will tell European
Union leaders at their summit starting on Friday that cutting wages and
wholesale labour market deregulation are not the ways to beat the jobs
crisis and strengthen Europe's competitiveness.
Cutting wages and pruning welfare payments to price Europe's unemployed into
jobs would be 'socially unacceptable and politically untenable', and would
'only worsen the crisis by depressing domestic demand', according to the
Commission white paper on growth and jobs. This strategy document,
circulated yesterday to member governments, is intended to be the
centrepiece of the summit.
The Commission's approach contrasted sharply with the call yesterday from
Unice, the EU employers' confederation, for a comprehensive reduction in
labour costs and the privatisation of welfare systems.
Unice's report, Making Europe more Competitive, is timed to gain employers a
prominent voice in the summit debate.
The report wants:
To reduce Europe's high non-wage labour costs, especially social security
contributions for the low-paid and young workers.
Real wage increases to be kept below rises in productivity.
Higher wage differentials, especially by cutting minimum wages and marginal
tax rates.
The Euro-employers also want relaxation of rules on working hours, easier
hire-and-fire laws, lower unemployment benefit and more limited access to
the social security system. Unice also wants a general roll-back of the
public sector and a review of EU legislation with a view to scrapping
regulation which implies costs for industry.
The central employment section of the white paper emphasises lifelong
training, lifting non-wage costs off low-skilled work, job-sharing and more
part-time work within companies rather than as a national scheme. It
envisages a push to develop services for work-seekers. 'Unemployment
benefits can only be reduced so far before the poverty line is reached,' the
white paper says, adding: 'These limits have already been reached in several
countries.'
A senior EC official called the approach 'readjusting regulation to fit the
present situation'.

FT  08 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Smith New Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The small proportion of shareholders who declined to take up Smith New
Court's rights issue in June must be kicking themselves. Even after
yesterday's round of profit-taking, the shares stand at almost double the
210p rights price. Rising world equity markets can take much of the credit.
The upward march on the shares was notably halted in September and November,
when UK equities were weak.
While the market is bubbling, though, cost control is perhaps the biggest
management challenge. On the basis of yesterday's half-year figures, Smith's
traders and analysts will be among those City folk looking forward to bumper
bonuses in the New Year. Since staff costs make up 75 per cent of Smith's
controllable costs, wage inflation is a serious threat. But big bonuses will
not worry shareholders if basic salaries and the formula linking bonus
payments to profits remain firmly under control.
Smith makes undisclosed provisions for bonuses throughout the year, so
second-half profits should not buckle under the strain of one-off payments.
The worry is that the shares still behave like a geared play on UK equities,
despite its efforts at diversification overseas. It is odds-on that Smith
will under-perform again should the London market hit a sticky patch.

FT  08 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Chubb Security
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ernest Harrison claimed throughout Williams Holdings' hostile bid for
Racal that Chubb Security was worth Pounds 700m. That now looks like more
than defensive bluff. Chubb's shares have out-performed the stock market by
40 per cent since it was demerged from Racal in September 1992. Its market
capitalisation now stands at Pounds 1bn. While that underlines how neglected
it had become prior to demerger, Chubb's management deserves full credit for
subsequently getting to grips with costs.
Although cost savings arising from the first phase of restructuring are
impressive, progress will be more difficult from here on. The challenge now
is to generate additional sales while resisting downward pressure on
margins. Replacing administrative staff with salesmen and rolling out a
stream of new products is an active response. If sales can be driven higher
while keeping the lid on fixed costs, margins should anyway improve.
Yet Chubb will have to increase sales in difficult markets almost from a
standing start. Without exchange rate benefits, turnover grew by only 3 per
cent in the first half. In electronic security, margins fell slightly. The
cost of expanding the sales force without compensating efficiencies
elsewhere is blamed for this temporary squeeze. The benefit of the sales
drive should, in theory, show through in the second half. With the dividend
covered almost three times by earnings and net cash in the balance sheet,
Chubb has room to increase the payout if progress proves slower than
expected. On a multiple of around 22 times this year's forecast earnings,
though, no one is holding the shares for the yield.

FT  08 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Siebe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stress which Siebe places on its cash flow is perhaps a response to
those who regard its ability to maintain margins through the recession with
suspicion. Had it simply relied on judicious use of acquisition provisions
at Foxboro, the company would surely not have met its targets for reducing
gearing. The fact though, that yesterday's interim figures provided further
positive news on this score is no longer quite enough. Having taken the axe
to Foxboro's costs, the time has come when the controls division should be
seeing more benefit from operational gearing and volume-driven growth. There
has been some recovery in the US, but that is offset by weakness in Europe.
Some Pounds 10m of the Pounds 14m increase in pre-tax profits was accounted
for by exchange rate changes, and margins in the controls division have
fallen slightly. Siebe's claim that they would have increased without the
new charge for retirement healthcare and the consolidation of two small
acquisitions is scant consolation. That would still have left them below the
16.3 per cent earned in 1992-93, while the retirement charge will recur.
Siebe is thus not yet able to deliver strong organic growth. This may owe
more to economic circumstance than to any management shortcomings. But it
suggests further reliance on acquisitions which would also help explain
Siebe's interest in conserving cash. The market seems to have factored in
the implications for earnings quality. A prospective multiple of around 18
times puts Siebe on a lower rating than other cyclical stocks such as those
in building materials.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The much-touted marriage between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom appears
to have been watered down to cohabitation in a service flat in Brussels. The
partners are pooling sophisticated services for multinational companies -
very much in line with the joint venture between BT and MCI. Yet there is no
comparable sharing of equity, nor a merging of mainstream international
telecoms businesses. In part, that may be because the two companies are not
ready - France Telecom may not even become a limited company and the
privatisation of Deutsche may be postponed. The suspicion must be, however,
that the European Commission would take a dim view of the two companies
collaborating in markets which are not yet open to competition.
Pitching into competitive data services is merely to follow the herd. But
the market is not large by telecoms standards, and margins are unlikely to
be high. Perhaps telecoms companies have focused on this area because it is
one of the few where regulation does not currently prevent competition. The
limited capital commitment also means that it will be hard to come to much
harm.
Still, alliances made in haste for niche markets may be repented at leisure
when wider competition is allowed. The participants will, however, probably
have plenty of time to reflect on that. Closer links between France Telecom
and Deutsche Telekom would have to be offset by more open access to domestic
markets. Neither would be keen to allow that, at least while their high
business tariffs subsidise domestic users. That would be an open invitation
for BT and Mercury to pick off their best customers.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Delors fights work deregulation: Brussels believes
unemployed cannot be 'priced into jobs'

Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will tell European
Union leaders at their summit starting on Friday that cutting wages and
wholesale labour market deregulation are not the ways to beat the jobs
crisis and strengthen Europe's competitiveness.
Cutting wages and pruning welfare payments to price Europe's unemployed into
jobs would be 'socially unacceptable and politically untenable', and would
'only worsen the crisis by depressing domestic demand', according to the
Commission white paper on growth and jobs. This strategy document,
circulated yesterday to member state governments, is intended to be the
centrepiece of the two-day Brussels summit.
The Commission's approach contrasted sharply with the call yesterday from
Unice, the EU employers' confederation, for a comprehensive reduction in
labour costs and the privatisation of welfare systems.
Unice's report, called 'Making Europe more Competitive', is timed to gain
employers a voice in the summit debate. It wants:
To reduce Europe's high non-wage labour costs, especially social security
contributions for the low paid and young workers.
Real wage increases below rises in productivity.
Higher wage differentials, especially by cutting minimum wages and marginal
tax rates.
The Euro-employers also want relaxation of rules on working hours, easier
hire-and-fire laws, lower unemployment benefit and more limited access to
the social security system. In a manifesto that only the UK among the 12
would feel altogether comfortable with, Unice also wants a general roll-back
of the public sector and a review of EU legislation with a view to scrapping
regulation which implies costs for industry.
The central employment section of the white paper emphasises lifelong
training and retraining, lifting non-wage costs off low-skilled work,
job-sharing and more part-time working within companies rather than as a
national scheme. It envisages a big push to develop services for those
seeking employment. 'Unemployment benefits can only be reduced so far before
the poverty line is reached,' the white paper says, adding: 'These limits
have already been reached in several countries.'
A senior Commission official described the approach as 'not deregulation,
but readjusting regulation to fit the present situation . . . social
engineering that goes with the market.'
The paper maintains that restored growth might deal with cyclical job
losses, and advocates a big investment drive in information technology and
pan-European rail, road and energy networks to raise competitiveness.
But Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner whose
department designed the jobs strategy, say structural unemployment requires
government and industry to promote more employment-intensive work patterns.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Stress at work should be seen as safety issue, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stress at work is increasing sharply and should be recognised officially as
a health and safety issue, a report urged yesterday.
Professor Tom Cox of Nottingham University, who prepared the report for the
Health and Safety Executive, said the problem needed government recognition
if employers were to tackle it effectively.
The report, published ahead of HSE guidelines due out next year to help
employers manage stress at work, recommended further research into the
problem, along with training for employers. Recent Manchester University
research showed that 90m working days a year were being lost in the UK
through stress.
The recommendations come at a time when growing numbers of employees are
seeking compensation from their companies for stress-related illnesses.
Several test cases are due to come before the courts. In one, a former City
worker alleges that her 10-15 hour day caused a mental breakdown. Another
employee claims that stress through overwork led to a gynaecological
disorder. In a third case, a junior production manager is claiming that
shortage of staff led to illness through overwork.
According to one of Britain's leading stress counsellors, the problem is
growing more acute as companies emerge from recession with smaller
workforces and leaner managements.
Mr Alistair Anderson, managing director of Personal Performance Consultants
UK, which has contracts with 60 companies covering 130,000 workers
nationwide, said he had noticed a disturbing number of suicides involving
work pressures. 'I believe the demands on the workforce are greater than
they have ever been,' he said.
'Downsizing in companies has meant that often people have been left
ill-equipped and ill-prepared for the job expected of them. That in itself
creates great stress.'
The report by Prof Cox, an occupational psychologist, identified excessive
periods of repetitive work, lack of management support and overdemanding
work schedules as contributory causes of stress.
Added factors were low pay, poor relationships with managers, lack of
variety, shift working, long hours, job insecurity and conflicting demands
of work and home.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Dinosaurs on the runway: Small no-frills airlines are
forcing the bigger, lossmaking US carriers to rethink their strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something is badly wrong with the US airline industry. Deregulated 15 years
ago and run entirely by the private sector, it should be a shining beacon of
enterprise and profitability in a global industry otherwise characterised by
state-owned monopolies, inefficiency and heavy losses. Instead, it is on the
ropes.
US airlines carried a record number of passengers last year: they also lost
more than Dollars 4bn. In the past three years, the industry has lost nearly
Dollars 10bn - in nominal terms more than all the profits it has made since
the Wright brothers achieved the world's first powered flight in 1903.
Despite windfall gains from a recent fall in jet fuel prices, the industry
is heading for more heavy losses this year.
The big carriers are in retreat, hacking away at their domestic networks in
the hope of discovering a profitable core. Older aircraft are being retired
and orders for new ones deferred, hitting Boeing and the other
manufacturers. The airlines are shedding jobs by the thousand, and asking
remaining employees to work harder for less, as they struggle to cut costs.
Now the industry's plight is starting to intrude into the public
consciousness as labour unions fight the job losses and changes in working
practices. A strike by American Airlines' flight attendants disrupted tens
of thousands of passenger journeys in the run-up to last month's
Thanksgiving holiday, before President Bill Clinton leaned on management to
accept a union demand for binding arbitration.
So what has gone wrong? The obvious explanation is that too many aircraft
are chasing too few passengers. That argument appears to be contradicted by
last year's record passenger numbers. But load factors can be misleading: in
reality, the airlines found themselves faced with such a large surplus of
capacity that they filled the empty seats by launching a ruinous price war,
hence the record losses.
Recession is part of the reason why overcapacity arose in the first place.
The relatively prosperous years of the 1980s encouraged airlines to order
new aircraft, but long lead times meant these started to arrive just as the
economy was turning down. Apart from last year's upward blip, passenger
numbers have been stagnant (or worse) for five years.
US bankruptcy law must also share the blame. Normally, company failures
might be expected to rectify the imbalance between supply and demand by
putting the worst-hit carriers out of business. Sure enough, some famous
names have gone - Pan Am and Eastern, for example - but chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code has given companies such as Continental Airlines, Trans
World Airlines and America West protection from creditors, enabling them to
go on flying, when they would otherwise have failed.
More important, however, than either of these factors is the structural
change being wrought in the industry by the arrival of a new wave of
carriers typified by the Texas-based Southwest Airlines (see below). These
have eaten heavily into the big carriers' domestic markets by offering
services at bargain prices. Their fares are often a third of those of the
bigger carriers.
Passengers who fly with these smaller carriers enjoy few frills. The
aircraft are one-class, seats are not assigned and the service is
rudimentary. But the secret of the smaller carriers' low fares is behind the
scenes, in the much higher levels of productivity they achieve from their
workforces.
For years, the strategy of the big US carriers has been based on the
hub-and-spoke system - that is, flying passengers from feeder cities on the
spokes of the system into a big central hub, then redistributing them on to
other flights to their destination. The system is seen as the most efficient
way of offering the widest choice of destinations to the largest number of
customers, and has been copied around the world.
The hub-and-spoke concept, however, suffers at least one big disadvantage.
In order to provide for all the flights to connect with one another, they
all have to converge on the hub at about the same time. That means employing
the staff and resources necessary to cope with high levels of activity at
the peak, only to have them standing idle during the troughs that occupy the
rest of the day.
The small carriers do not have to suffer this waste of resources because
they do not have hub-and-spoke operations. Instead, they run highly
intensive shuttle services on busy routes between pairs of cities. Staff are
kept fully employed because aircraft follow one another in and out of the
airport all day, and turnround times are cut to the bone because the
aircraft do not have to wait for connections.
Surprisingly, perhaps, the smaller carriers' staff are often paid at much
the same rates as their colleagues working for the bigger carriers. Many
belong to unions, too. But they work much more flexibly and productively
than the big carriers' staff. Pilots spend less time waiting around and more
time flying, and get paid only when they are in the cockpit. Flight
attendants clean the passenger cabin in the few minutes' interval between
the aircraft's arrival and departure.
The result of the small carriers' high productivity levels is that the big
carriers - though counting themselves among the leanest, fittest and most
competitive operators in the world - have taken on the appearance of
dinosaurs in their home territory, and have been forced into a drastic
reappraisal.
One strand of the reappraisal common to all carriers is their desperate need
to cut costs - particularly labour costs, which typically account for at
least 35 per cent of the total. Some airlines have shown themselves willing
to trade massive equity stakes in return for concessions from their
employees, as a result of which the labour unions now own 37.5 per cent of
Northwest Airlines, 45 per cent of Trans World Airlines, and are negotiating
for 60 per cent of United Airlines. Too often, the alternative has seemed to
be a crippling strike that few are prepared to face - though American
Airlines was ready for a fight, until President Clinton intervened.
Meanwhile the airlines have also had to reassess the fundamental structure
of their operations, even to the extent of questioning whether the
hub-and-spoke concept is valid any more. At the very least, they are
withdrawing from short-haul feeder routes and handing them over to smaller
operators - either wholly-owned subsidiaries, as with the American Airline
companies flying under the American Eagle name, or more often to partially
owned or independent regional carriers.
But perhaps the most significant sign of the times is the move by the
non-union Continental Airlines to set up a low-cost shuttle service called
CALite, which mimics the no-frills carriers by providing frequent direct
flights between cities instead of requiring people to change flights at a
hub. CALite also does it cheaply: it invites passengers to combine ultra-low
'Peanuts Fares' to some destinations with another offer called 'Add A Penny,
Add A Pal', under which the passenger's companion flies for 1c each way.
CALite is still in its early days, but its evolution demonstrates a growing
acceptance among the big carriers that domestic air travel in the US has
been transformed once and for all by the no-frills carriers into a commodity
business - low-cost, high-volume and with little added value.
Each is responding in its own way. American is pulling out of routes where
it cannot compete. United is trying to negotiate a deal with its unions
which would result in the setting up of a low-cost operation, like CALite,
to handle short-haul domestic flights. Delta is also thinking of following
the Continental example.
The fact that the airlines are prepared to contemplate such radical action
indicates that, although they have made some progress in adjusting to the
new era, they still have a long way to go. With or without economic
recovery, the turmoil looks set to worsen.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Euro telecom alliances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Franco-German telecoms alliance announced yesterday provokes a certain
queasiness. Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are Europe's two largest
telecommunications operators, are still state-owned and have wide-ranging
monopoly powers. There is a danger that, by joining forces, they will form a
cartel dominating the heart of Europe.
Yet it would be wrong to oppose the link-up on principle. The division of
Europe's telecommunications market on national lines is the result of a long
history of state-run monopoly. Now that markets are slowly being opened to
competition and carriers are being privatised, it is natural for the
industry to restructure on cross-border lines.
The Franco-German alliance is a milestone in this trend. Other examples
include British Telecom's alliance with MCI of the US, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph's Worldsource consortium and a three-way link-up between the
Dutch, Swedish and Swiss operators, called Unisource.
The benefits for customers from an end to the industry's balkanisation could
be considerable. The main potential prizes are an end to the 'frontier
effect', under which cross-border calls typically cost three times as much
as national calls of the same distance, and a wider range of trans-European
business services.
This is not to say that Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are motivated by
a desire to deliver lower call charges. Their alliance seems largely
defensive, stemming from fear that their monopoly bases could be eroded by
competition from BT and AT&amp;T. The duo believe they will be more able to
withstand competition if they form a united front.
Retrograde step
Nor is it to say that the benefits of an end to balkanisation will flow
through to customers automatically. If the Franco-German link-up delays
competition, it will be a retrograde step.
The details of the deal are less alarming than feared when news of it first
leaked last month. Early reports suggested that the two groups wished to
merge all their international activities, including ordinary phone calls,
and also link up with AT&amp;T. Such a deal between the world's three biggest
international carriers might indeed, as BT said, have been 'grotesque' -
particularly since the duo still have monopoly rights to provide ordinary
voice services.
The actual deal is more limited. It focuses on data services and value-added
business services, which have theoretically been liberalised throughout the
European Union. But there are still concerns. In the short term, it remains
to be seen whether the markets for data services are genuinely open to
competition. In the longer term, plans for the duo to take equity stakes in
each other and expand their alliance may prove anti-competitive. The danger
is that they could exclude rivals from their markets and use their enlarged
home base to dominate other markets.
Public interest
Rather than blocking such link-ups and so losing the potential benefits of
cross-border restructuring, Europe's competition authorities must seek to
make alliances work in the public interest. This means adopting a more
vigorous approach to opening up markets.
So far, the European Commission has been rather timid. Under its latest
plans, not only will liberalisation of basic voice services be delayed until
1998. There is also no sign that competitors will be allowed to build their
own networks, meaning they will have to rely on infrastructure owned by the
national monopolies.
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom yesterday showed no sign of wanting more
radical action. Nor did the EU's telecom ministers, also meeting in
Brussels.
Things might be different if Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission's
president, realised the connection between liberalisation and his
much-cherished goal of trans-European networks. The end to Europe's
balkanisation, at least in telecommunications, will not best be achieved by
the Commission launching 'Brussels bonds' and channelling the funds to
monopolies. A better approach would be to open up the market and rely on
competitive private enterprise to build the infrastructure. Mr Delors should
devote his energies to securing this end.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Peanuts that cost peanuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It pays to have a sense of humour when you fly by Southwest Airlines, the
Dallas-based carrier leading the low-cost revolution in US air travel. Herb
Kelleher, the 62-year-old chairman, is a man who likes a joke, and
encourages a similar attitude among his staff, writes Richard Tomkins.
Flight attendants have been known to astonish passengers by concealing
themselves in luggage lockers and springing out unexpectedly into the
aisles. Passenger announcements are invariably tinged with levity ('Please
be aware all seating is unassigned,' people are told as they board an
aircraft in Dallas. 'Y'all sit yourselves anywhere, just like in church.')
Southwest can afford to be funny. Indeed, as virtually the only US airline
to have stayed consistently profitable over the past few years, it is
laughing all the way to the bank. Stock market analysts are predicting it
will increase pre-tax profits by more than 50 per cent to Dollars 140m in
the year just ending - not a vast sum by US corporate standards, perhaps,
but enough to make it the nation's most profitable airline.
How is that an upstart like Southwest can make money while its bigger rivals
prove so adept at losing it? The answer lies in its low cost structure. The
airline specialises in short-haul, point-to-point services with frequent
flights, no frills and fast turnrounds, and its workers are hard-working,
flexible and enthusiastic. Result: its operating costs per available seat
mile are 26 per cent lower than the average for the big carriers.
That cost structure has translated into rock-bottom fares that have enabled
Southwest to trounce the competition. Spreading across the south from its
home territory in Texas, where it is easily the dominant carrier, it has
become the biggest operator of flights within California and has driven
American Airlines out of the short-haul market in the south-west.
In September it began an assault on the north-east by offering flights on
the Baltimore-Chicago and Baltimore-Cleveland routes at fares up to 85 per
cent less than those available from existing oper-ators.
Taking a flight by Southwest Airlines is a novel experience for passengers
accustomed to elaborate checking-in rituals, fawning service and endless
parades of drinks and meals.
Southwest has quite deliberately trivialised the ritual, making it a bit
like catching a bus but more fun. Passengers just turn up, and if they miss
the aircraft, it doesn't matter, because there will be another one along in
a minute.
Refreshments might be limited to a bag of peanuts and a soft drink, but the
light-hearted banter from Southwest's staff leaves most people feeling much
better at the end of their journeys than any number of in-flight meals.
Best of all, the flights are cheap. The low-fares strategy has proved highly
addictive to the US consumer. People are not only deserting other airlines
to fly by Southwest: they are also choosing to fly rather than drive, or to
undertake journeys they might not otherwise have made.
One question inevitably raised about the Southwest formula is whether its
success will last. After all, people are bound to trade down in a recession.
Maybe, as the US economy picks up, passengers will want to pay more and go
back to the old-fashioned levels of service traditionally associated with
air travel.
But not even Southwest's bigger rivals believe that. They openly acknowledge
that Southwest and its ilk have changed US flying habits for good. According
to American Airlines, most passengers will now happily put up with lower
levels of in-flight service if it means they can afford to spend another
couple of days at their desti-nation.
'Basically, the American public is saying: 'Strap me in that metal tube and
get me there for 59 bucks,' ' the company says. Or as Mr Stephen Wolf,
chairman of United Airlines, told a US newspaper: 'Even the wealthy are
concluding that they should buy a lower-priced ticket on Southwest and use
the difference to buy a eucalyptus tree for their home.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While Britain's education secretary John Patten still seems to be making
heavy going of his first cabinet job, the business career of his
well-presented wife, Louise, goes from strength to strength.
Yesterday she picked up another nice little earner, an advisory role at Bain
&amp; Co, one of the more aggressive management consultants. Over the past year
she has moved up from being a partner of PA Consulting to join the
big-league head-hunters at Heidrick and Struggles, and has added a
non-executive directorship of Ladbroke on the way. And unlike her husband,
she has still not turned 40.
Caroline Portillo, wife of Britain's chief financial secretary, is also
making a name for herself at one of Louise Patten's rivals, Spencer Stuart.
So, if, heaven forbid, two of Britain's cabinet ministers ever lost the
support of the electorate, they should not have much difficulty finding a
new job.

Take Ian Kydd, the 46-year-old head of the FO newsroom, who hopes not to be

round the world on Chay Blyth's Ocean Challenge 1996-97.
Kydd beat more than 2,600 applicants, only to be treated, during the final

he makes it as one of the two lucky (?) crew members part-funded by The

With some experience of sailing Laser dinghies in Lagos harbour in his last

Blyth's little outing without a clew.
Observer wishes him luck in giving those media sharks the slip.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However, it is good to see that Her Majesty's Treasury doesn't have to throw
the same sort of money around in order to secure loyalty and greater
efficiency of its staff.
At yesterday's meeting of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee, Joseph
Halligan, an official dealing with social security, surprised MPs by
admitting that his motivation was helped by performance-related pay. It had
an impact on his living standards and was relevant to his future promotion.
With a marked quickening of interest, the MPs pressed Halligan on how much
of his pay packet was performance-related?
'Two per cent,' replied the bureaucrat. 'But it makes a difference  ..'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Observer: Market forced in Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, knows what market forces can do
to his business. He is finding it increasingly hard to fill his cabinet with
the best people because of the hefty salaries on offer in Singapore's
high-growth private sector. Two of his ministers plan to quit within the
next six months.
To try to stop the political rot, his government has announced wide-ranging
pay increases, starting with Goh's own basic salary. It's been increased by
20 per cent to SDollars 45,867 a month. When bonuses are taken into account,
it rises to more than SDollars 60,000 per month. In US dollar terms this is
equivalent to Dollars 450,000 a year, which is more than twice the salary of
the president of the United States and four times what Britain's prime
minister is paid.
'If you pay peanuts you'll get monkeys for your ministers,' says Goh.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Leading Article: A settlement at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wrangle at Lloyd's long ago ceased being an issue of fairness and became
one of cold practicality. How much damage could lawsuits from Names caught
up in the spiral of losses in the late 1980s do to the institution as a
whole? How much was it worth to the rest of Lloyd's to buy them off?
Yesterday's offer, of compensation worth some Pounds 900m, is an example of
that chilly calculus at work. It is heavily skewed towards those Names with
the strongest legal case and the greatest demonstrated determination to
pursue it. On average, it amounts to just under a third of the total
compensation claimed by the lossmaking Names to whom it is being made. But
those with the strongest cases - members of action groups, heavily exposed
to the 'spiral' of reinsurance, perhaps in syndicates managed by Gooda
Walker - can expect average compensation of up to about 40 per cent of their
losses.
If they accept. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the proposed
settlement, apart from its sheer complexity, is the way it will force each
potential litigant to assess individually whether or not to accept the
offer. Lloyd's new managers - Mr David Rowland, chairman and Mr Peter
Middleton, chief executive - have promised that the offer will go ahead only
if it receives acceptance from a substantial majority of the 21,000 Names
eligible for it. Despite the immediate hostile reaction of the Names' action
groups, that is an open question.
Finely balanced
For some people, bankrupt two or three times over, entitled only to the
lower end of the settlement's compensation scale, the question is a simple
one: there is nothing to be gained from such modest terms. The offer 'leaves
ruined Names ruined', as the leader of one action group put it yesterday.
For others, particularly 'working' Names with limited exposure, earning a
steady flow of income from the market, the issue is equally clear cut the
other way.
For most, though, the question is finely balanced. They must weigh the
individual offer they will be receiving in the next few days against the
chances of success in continued legal action. How much of their potential
recoveries from such lawsuits will be gobbled up in lawyers' fees? How much
of any award that a court makes will ever turn up in hard cash, paid not by
now bankrupt Lloyd's agents but from the limited sums available from their
errors and omissions insurers?
For anyone contemplating such a difficult decision, the question would be
simpler if Lloyd's could promise finality, the confidence that the nightmare
was at last over. Alas, that is not what the settlement offers. It covers
only current claims for the years up to - and in some cases including -
1990. Claims still to come in - especially the potentially devastating
'long-tail' claims over environmental and other damage in the United States
 -are not included. Nor are losses in respect of later years, some of which
will also be bad.
Reinsurance vehicle
Lloyd's is working on a device to provide the finality that the battered
Names so desperately seek: a reinsurance vehicle which will shoulder the
claims of the past and allow Names to escape from them once and for all.
Even assuming that it works, however, it will come into existence only in
1996 - and it will probably require Names to make a further
yet-to-be-specified contribution.
The settlement proposed yesterday is thus an intermediate step, buying time
from the point of view of Lloyd's new managers, providing some partial
compensation from the point of view of the Names affected. It does not offer
one thing the Names have sought: a sense of moral vindication, a recognition
that they are innocents in a system that was at best mismanaged, at worst a
scandal.
For some people, especially those lured into Lloyd's by ties of family or
friendship rather than investment decision, that will be enough to make it
unacceptable. That such flawed judgments were common in the 1980s boom is a
sad reflection on the market's leaders of the time. It is not, however, a
reason to reject the proposed settlement. Names would be best advised to
judge it in the light of a prudent, rational calculation of their own
interests. If that is not enough to deliver the acceptance necessary, so
much the worse for Lloyd's.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Resurrecting the wages fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DAVID PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So 'most economists subscribe to a core of theory - mostly
micro-economic - that is useful and should therefore be heeded by
politicians' (Michael Prowse, December 2, reviewing Alfred Malabre's book
Lost Prophets).
I am intrigued - what core of theory has he in mind? Given that the Treasury
has now decided that the pay of all public sector workers over the next few
years must be met out of an existing wage bill, and that therefore jobs must
be traded for higher wages, which economists did the chancellor heed when
resurrecting the 'wages fund' doctrine?

FT  08 DEC 93 / The FT Interview: Cheshire cat among the pigeons - John Birt
of the BBC talks to Raymond Snoddy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Birt, the director-general of the BBC, is reluctant to confess. But
press him hard enough and he says: 'I have - I am sorry to say it, it's a
genuine feeling - a strong sense of success.'
Probe a little deeper and Birt, who as recently as March, was under
widespread attack when it was revealed he had a consultant's contract with
the corporation and was not a staff member, goes further: 'I don't think I
have had an unpleasant time. I think I have had one of the most satisfying
years of my life. There is a very, very strong feeling here of achievement.'
For Birt and the BBC it has indeed been a remarkable year. The corporation
has experienced one of the most radical changes in its history - Producer
Choice has been implemented. This is the name given to the move away from a
'command economy', where all services to producers were provided from the
centre, to an internal market where producers control their own budgets and
can buy outside services.
As a result, several thousand staff jobs have gone but Pounds 100m has been
saved this year to spend on programmes.
Even more important for the BBC is the government's decision to allow the
compulsory annual licence fee, now Pounds 83, to rise in line with retail
prices for the last three years of the corporation's Royal Charter until the
end of 1996.
This relatively generous licence fee settlement indicates that the
government acknowledges the BBC is taking serious steps to cut costs.
For Birt, the year has been not just one in which he survived a public
mauling, but also one in which he achieved a significant victory over his
opponents in the organisation - those he has mocked as ancient warriors
pointing their old muskets. The licence fee award is a triumph that even
Birt's most begrudging detractors would have to recognise. It might also
pave the way for Birt to deliver a second, perhaps more startling, win. In
the debate over the Royal Charter - the conditions under which the BBC
operates - he may be able to persuade the government that there is a
continuing role for a universal licence fee, which every television set
owner must pay, in an age when cable and satellite television offers
ever-increasing choice.
So does Birt feel he has won?
'Won is a funny word. Won in what respect?' he asks. He adds that there is a
growing public understanding of the BBC's achievements in reforming itself
over the past few years and again creating hits, such as Absolutely
Fabulous, and dramas, such as Scarlet and Black. There is, Birt says, a
sense that programmes are being put first and 'a degree of excitement' that
a public sector institution is reforming itself and doing it effectively.
But won?
'I'm not going to use that expression. I don't even think like that. That
implies that you've passed a finishing post. We are not through the charter
review debate, nor is the job finished,' Birt says.
He is speaking in his first newspaper interview for almost a year. Apart
from wanting to spell out the scale of the accomplishment at the BBC, he
also wants to counter the arguments advanced by Ian Hargreaves in his
pamphlet, Sharper Vision, published recently by Demos, the independent
think-tank. Hargreaves, a former director of news and current affairs at the
BBC and now deputy editor of the Financial Times, argued that the BBC's
future would be most effectively protected by privatisation, including a
stake for the staff. Over a 10-year period the company would move towards a
mixed method of funding - licence fee, advertising and subscription - and
would thus be liberated from ties to government.
While the political battle for such changes has almost certainly been lost,
they have aroused high-level interest - Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, has started looking at the export potential of British
programmes, and is known to be intrigued by such radical views.
Birt's disagreement, in particular with the idea of mixed funding, is total.
'If you change the method of funding, you are inevitably going to change the
nature of the institution and the programmes it supplies,' he says.
In a commercially funded system such as ITV, however regulated, you take
decisions on a business basis, he says. As programme director at London
Weekend Television, Birt commissioned such popular and profitable programmes
as Blind Date and London's Burning.
Advertising on the BBC would put the two systems of broadcasting 'in naked
and direct competition', changing both ITV and Channel 4 as well as the BBC.
Birt believes that in 10 years the BBC licence fee, now 23p a day, will be
more defensible and seem better value as viewers get used to paying much
larger sums for cable and satellite channels. He concedes, however, that the
BBC has to find easier ways for poor people to pay. The corporation is also
developing a more aggressive global strategy - exploiting 'the most powerful
broadcast media brand name in the world' and its programmes by transmitting
television and radio programmes around the world in both English and local
languages.
Bob Phillis, the BBC deputy director-general and head of the World Service,
is working on a comprehensive plan for all the corporation's business
interests. The main points include organising the BBC's activities on a
regional basis, setting up an arm's-length relationship with BBC
Enterprises, the commercial wing, and creating specialist satellite
television channels with or without partners.
'We will greatly increase the amount of money coming into the BBC from our
commercial activities chiefly outside the UK,' says Birt, who believes that
the contribution could rise from about Pounds 60m a year to three times as
much by the end of the decade.
While he acknowledges the sense of hurt and insecurity the rapid reforms he
has initiated have already caused, the modernisation of the BBC will
continue apace. Overheads are still too high, there is still excess capacity
 -which means more jobs will go - and too many middle managers are
inflexible and uncommunicative with their staff, and will have to be
replaced by younger people, Birt says.
Mostly he talks of success and is hard put to think of any serious errors
made over the past year. Producer Choice has been 'a very great success',
and modest teething problems must be set against the massive gains.
There has been no recent switch in the BBC's programme philosophy, he adds;
policy has merely been caricatured as wanting to provide only those
programmes, such as opera and hard-hitting documentaries, that commercial
television is less likely to make. The policy was, and remains, to offer
high-quality programmes for the entire audience.
'No change. There has been no change. No change whatsoever. No. No,' says
Birt.
Surely most people would regard his freelance contractual arrangement with
his employer as a grievous error?
'Weeeeeell. I mean, wouldn't they?' he says, adding that when he arrived at
the BBC in 1987 'dozens of people in ITV' had exactly the same arrangements,
and at the BBC 'other members - plural - of the BBC board of management had
exactly the same arrangements'.
As the row fades into history, there seems to be no doubt in Birt's mind, as
he enters his second year in charge of one of the world's most famous
broadcasting organisations, that his first year was 'a very great success
indeed'.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Need to rationalise ITV's fragmented
advertising regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GREG DYKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Grade's letter ('Advertisers threatened by ITV changes',
November 27), urges the ITC to preserve its present 25 per cent limit on the
share of ITV revenue that can be sold by any single ITV sales house. This is
both self-seeking and unduly alarmist.
The ITC has said it will review the sales house rules early next year: one
of the factors it will take into account is the way the TV air-time market
is changing.
Channel Four takes nearly 18 per cent of the market at the moment and is by
far the largest single commercial broadcaster in the UK. (It will still be
number two even if the Central and Carlton air-time is sold together.)
If the ITC revised the rules to permit an lTV sales company to take up to 25
per cent of the market, this would make life less comfortable for Channel
Four but would scarcely imperil its existence.
Advertisers already have real choice in the TV market, and this choice will
grow as satellite and cable companies increase their audience share.
It is in everyone's interest (including the advertisers) that ITV remains a
strong channel, commissioning and producing original British programmes on a
scale exceeded only by the BBC.
Rationalising its present fragmentary structure, in both the ownership rules
and the sales rules, is a necessary prerequisite for this.

efficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHIL DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a former director of human resources in an NHS trust hospital, I
agree that efficiencies attained in the private sector are attainable in the
NHS. However, I believe that there are five significant pre-conditions:
(1) Any savings made on reducing central bureaucracy should not be
immediately clawed back by the Treasury but rather made available by trusts
to facilitate change.
(2) Boards of directors must be allowed real freedom, without the
interference of national pay bodies, to negotiate locally whatever salaries
are required to recruit and retain the best clinical and managerial staff
within their overall budget.
(3) The rules on capital spending must be relaxed to allow private
investment.
(4) The cost of large-scale redundancies, which currently is borne in year
and therefore can prevent a trust from meeting targets, should either be
centrally funded or allowed for over a longer period, say five years.
(5) The rules on transfer of undertakings for public employees needs to be
sorted out to facilitate contracting out of non-core activities.
Public service organisations want to do better but government has to
deliver.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Code of banking practice has failed
to deliver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN BEISHON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There are times when a mere fulsome apology will not do, and the
reaction of the British Bankers' Association to the December Which? report
on banking services is one of them ('Customers report banking errors',
December 2).
If, as our survey suggests, one in five bank and building society customers
has suffered mistakes in standing orders or direct debits, people should
check their statements; but it is adding insult to injury for banks to
demand the same. Mistakes are the banks' responsibility; so is spotting
them. Urging vigilance on customers is an acknowledgement of failure and an
encouragement to complacency.
The Bankers' Association emerged with further, equally shameful comments
aimed at deflecting criticism, complaining that our survey of more than
3,600 banking customers was, astonishingly, 'too small', and that Which?
members are more likely to grumble about banking problems. On both counts,
professional opinion disagrees. So, no doubt, would the chief executives of
Abbey National, First Direct, Girobank and Yorkshire Bank, which topped our
poll in terms of overall satisfaction. If they can please customers, why not
the Big Four?
The code of banking practice promised a new era of improved standards of
service. It has clearly failed to deliver. If the code cannot be improved
considerably and enforced rigorously, it should be replaced with statutory
standards imposed at government level. Only then will the disgraceful
concept of DIY account management be consigned to where it belongs: in the
past.

FT  08 DEC 93 / A pill to beat MF: The EU's search for a constitution is
just beginning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maastricht fatigue (MF) is endemic throughout the European Union, though
observable in its most acute form among British members of parliament. The
main symptom is an inability or unwillingness to listen to any proposition
intended to improve the institutions or processes of the Union.
Specialists differ about the precise causes of the disease and about the
treatment. One school of thought sees MF as a normal reaction of the human
organism to prolonged exposure to the subject in question, and recommends
that the patient be shielded as far as possible from further exposure. The
other holds that MF is caused by the form that discussion about European
institutions took between about mid-1991 and autumn 1993.
According to this view, while the reaction may indeed be 'normal' it is not
healthy and, if allowed to develop, may have dangerous effects. This school
favours a homeopathic remedy: the source of the trouble should be used as an
antidote but in carefully adjusted doses, enabling the patient to develop
appropriate antibodies.
I hope the second school is right, because the idea that the next bout of
argument about Euro-institutions can be put off, or confined to a minimal
convulsion which no one will notice, is surely an illusion.
Negotiations now in progress between the EU and four applicant countries -
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden - will produce, within a few months, a
new treaty of accession, requiring ratification not only in the new member
states but also in the existing ones. And the Maastricht treaty itself
provides for its own revision at an intergovernmental conference (IGC) in
1996. That, too, will produce changes which will have to be ratified.
It would make sense to telescope these two processes. The 1996 IGC could be
brought forward and the applicant countries could be invited to take part in
the conference but to delay putting their accession to the vote until the
results of the meeting were known. Then both old and new members would be
taking a decision, in late 1995, about the institutions of a wider Union
which their governments would all have agreed on.
That idea is too radical for the present mood of European governments. They
prefer to negotiate enlargement quickly - obliging the new members to join
the EU as it now stands - and then wait until 1996 to discuss such minimal
adjustments as seem unavoidable. This thinking is a classic symptom of MF,
but it is also the thinking that produced Maastricht in the first place.
In 1991 governments avoided any radical reform of EC institutions,
particularly in the direction of greater democracy. They knew that, in a
reformed system, states with larger populations would have greater influence
and that this would be difficult for smaller states to accept. But Danish
voters suspected (rightly) that such a reform was being planned behind their
backs, and this was one of the reasons they voted No in June 1992.
Now, by putting off reform until enlargement has gone through, governments
are nourishing the same suspicion among voters in the candidate countries,
many of whom are now swinging against the EU. Attempting to secure a Yes
vote, governments in those countries will promise to block any reform that
reduces their share of influence once they are in. That ensures that the
1996 IGC will be confrontational and sterile.
Perhaps the price of joining a workable and democratic union of 16 is simply
too high for voters in some applicant countries to accept. If so, it would
be better to establish that fact before the final decision on enlargement is
taken, rather than put them in a position where they can only defend their
sovereignty by making the union unworkable.
But there is a chance they would not come to that conclusion if the reform
proposed were sufficiently radical. Its object should be to make the central
institutions of the union strong enough to take effective action on matters
of genuine common interest, but to restrain them from interfering
unnecessarily with the lives of citizens in matters which could be dealt
with at the level of member states (or lower). This should be done in a
document which non-lawyers could understand, arrived at through a public
debate in which ordinary people and their elected representatives would
participate.
Such is the object of A Proposal for a European Constitution*, published
last week. Sadly, I hear this document is being rubbished in Brussels as an
'Anglo-Saxon' product, though only one of its 13 authors is a native
English-speaker, while French and Germans make up the majority. No doubt Mr
Jacques Delors's entourage dislike it for being permissive rather than
prescriptive on matters social and monetary, and for reserving 'to the
member states, or to the people' those rights and powers not delegated
'expressly or by necessary implication' to the union.
The authors wisely avoid the word 'federal' but it is clear they have drawn
inspiration from federal constitutions, including that of the US. In the
nature of things few people will agree with everything they suggest. (I, for
instance, would take issue with their claim to be defending the separation
of powers when they allow the council of ministers to remain the central
body, both executive and legislative.) But in their central object of
launching an informed public debate before next summer's European elections,
and well ahead of the 1996 IGC, they surely deserve to succeed. If there is
a homeopathic remedy for MF, this might be it.

Sir, David Owen ('Councils' rules on homeless may be relaxed', December 2)
does his best to explain how temporary accommodation for homeless families
is to be permanent. Let common sense prevail: temporary housing is not
suitable for families with children who need stable schooling and continuity
in their lives.
Now that we have stopped building council houses, there is enormous pressure
on the existing stock of re-lets, and no amount of shuffling the people who
need it can conceal the underlying shortage or the economic stupidity of
current policies. Scarce private rented accommodation costs between Pounds
100-Pounds 150 a week and traps people on benefits, with rising costs to the
national and council tax payer.
This policy makes no economic or social sense. In the longer term it is
unsustainable because of the shortage of private rented accommodation which
the Budget did nothing to reverse.
The housing benefit bill will rise and threaten the government's spending
targets. What will we do then? I hope the government knows the answer to
that question because, other than rising levels of homeless people on our
streets, we do not.

There must be something pretty funny about Ben Elton because some of us
continue to laugh even though his obsessive political correctness makes us
groan. It will be interesting to see whether his own adaptation of his own
book, Stark, is as funny as his stand-up act. Elton himself stars as an
English writer in Australia at a time when the earth is being asphyxiated by
industrial pollution (9.25 BBC2).
Elsewhere the schedules are dominated by state terrorism. Salman Rushdie
introduces Shooting The Writer. Six of Algeria's intelligentsia have been
assassinated this year, and Islamic terrorists have now issued an ultimatum
to the 100,000 foreigners in the country: leave or become targets (8.00
BBC2). In Human Rights, Human Wrongs Rushdie describes the way hundreds of
thousands of families have been destroyed in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 'ethnic
cleansing' (8.50 BBC2).
In his BBC1 series States Of Terror, Peter Taylor investigates US reactions
to the suicide attacks on Americans in Beirut in the early 1980s (9.30).

FT  08 DEC 93 / Arts: Picasso ballets in Paris - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was Diaghilev who brought Picasso to the ballet stage, as he did so many
more of the best painters of his time. No dance company today can boast such
acumen. Only in France - with the visual wit and adventurousness of Roland
Petit's troupes, and the proud record of Jean-Albert Cartier in finding
artists to decorate works for his companies - has there been a readiness to
let the painter's eye (rather than the designer's) show us something about
ballet. The tried, the true, the predictably winsome and the sullenly
grungey, make our dance-stages a dreary sight.
How good, then, to see such performances as the Paris Opera Ballet's current
Picasso et la danse, in which the eye is ravished, stimulated. Picasso made
three great designs for Diaghilev (Parade, Le Tricorne, Pulcinella), married
one of Diaghilev's dancers, and drew dancers for many years. His later
involvement with ballet amounted to the provision of decorative accessories,
beginning in 1924 with the two racing women who thunder across the painting
La Course, which Diaghilev borrowed as a front-cloth for Le Train bleu, and
including Picasso's suggestion that one of his war-time paintings (Candle
and Mask) would serve well as a front-cloth for Roland Petit's Le Rendezvous
of 1945.
The Opera Ballet's Picasso tribute has been revived after its successful
showing last season. It offers a reconstruction of Le Train bleu, with
Nijinska's dances evoked as much as restored; a very fine staging of Le
Rendezvous; and the sun-lit Andalucia of Tricorne. Le Train bleu, alas,
stopped running years ago, and this capriccio about gaiety on a 1920s plage
(it must be Eden Roc) is vivaciously dull. The central role of Le beau gosse
was, in 1924, a picture of the beauty and physical daring of Anton Dolin.
No-one today can capture the verve Dolin retained in even his late
performances as a dancer. Without such central allure the staging is
dutiful, spectral, unlikely.
Yet Roland Petit's Le Rendezvous, which is quite as much a period-piece with
its war's-end melancholy and existential disillusion, is tremendously alive.
A Young Man finds death in the arms of the Most Beautiful Girl in the World,
guided to her by the terrifying figure of destiny (a macabre top-hatted
being, stupendously taken by Cyril Atanassoff). The setting is Brassai's
photographs of Paris streets. The dance is as theatrically urgent as when we
saw it in 1945, and last week-end's performers (Patrick Dupond as the Young
Man; Marie-Claude Pietragalla as the Girl; Atanassoff as Destiny) were
grandly alert to the choreography's dramatic pulse. It was an ideal revival.
Tricorne is the only Spanish ballet in my experience that is authentically a
ballet and authentically about Spain. It is well done at the Opera, and
rather more alert in manner than last year. The designs and the de Falla
score do a lot of the work nowadays - there is a tendency for companies to
treat the piece as a glorious dress parade to a great score - but in Kader
Belarbi the role of the Miller has a bold interpreter. He has both the youth
and the vivid presence to make every moment count. The programme contains a
photograph taken of the young Massine - he was 24 when he created the part -
which tells everything of the dance's taut outlines. Belarbi, like last
year's dazzling debutant in the role, Jose Martinez, gives it the right edge
of sexual pride and rhythmic clarity.
Throughout this programme the Opera's dancers were on best form. We have in
the Palais Garnier a dance-house for Europe, and in its resident company a
peerless troupe. Visiting the new Richelieu wing of the Grand Louvre - which
is a triumph of design and restoration - the Barnes Collection at the Musee
d'Orsay, and the Opera Bastille, I was struck again by the seriousness and
generosity of France's patronage of the arts, and depressed even more by the
mean-spirited inadequacies of our own national response.
Gremlins in the machinery removed a paragraph from my Nutcracker notice in
Friday's paper of the Perm Ballet's British debut in Northampton at the
Derngate Theatre. With apologies to any puzzled readers, and to the Perm
Ballet, the missing sentences are herewith restored.
'No less than six different stagings of The Nutcracker are threatened this
year: the first outbreak, and I'd venture the most intriguing, is that on
view at Northampton's Derngate Theatre. Derngate, lively in its programming,
had scheduled a production from the Lille-based Ballet du Nord. That fell
through, and with a nice turn of speed, the theatre engaged a Russian
troupe, the Perm Ballet, never seen here before, albeit known and admired
from European tours. Perm was Diaghilev's birthplace. More significantly,
the Kirov Ballet was evacuated there when Leningrad was threatened with
siege in 1941, and the Kirov's influence on the Perm troupe and school was
to be profound and lasting.
This first visit (until December 11 at the Derngate, Northampton) is
welcome, and I hope a prelude to a more extended showing in future. The
troupe - something after the size of Birmingham's Royal Ballet - is well
mannered in technique, with a style that speaks clearly of Kirov example.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Arts: The Boston plays Berlioz - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The usual formula for a visiting orchestra is to bring a showpiece as an
advertisement for its virtuosity and a short work by a living composer back
home to display its patriotism. On Saturday the Boston Symphony Orchestra
reached London on its European tour with a rather more enterprising
programme.
By accident, this became a Berlioz weekend. While the Barbican was embarking
on its long-awaited series of concert performances of Les Troyens, offering
the two parts of that epic opera on consecutive days before putting them
together next Sunday, the Royal Festival Hall found itself in a position to
counter with another two-part Berlioz rarity - the Symphonie fantastique
performed with its sequel, Lelio.
The symphony is a favourite of the Boston orchestra and its Music Director,
Seiji Ozawa. They made a showpiece of it, as the occasion demanded. (Years
of working with Ozawa have clarified every inner part in this complex score,
allowing countless details in the wind and brass to come through.) But it
was also a performance that gave full rein to Berlioz's fevered imagination,
culminating in an eerie and violent dance at the witches' sabbath.
That last movement brings many a visiting orchestra's concert to an exciting
close. By putting the symphony in the first half and following it with the
strange Lelio, as the composer did, Ozawa allowed the focus of the evening
to be turned away from the orchestra and on to Berlioz himself. The stage
lights went down and a spotlight picked out Lambert Wilson, who was to speak
his words in this uniquely personal monologue with music.
Unlike most composers, Berlioz felt the need to express himself in writing.
His diaries show an inspired and original mind at work, but I am less sure
about the stream of artistic self-pity that pours out of Lelio. Berlioz may
come across as a more sensitive person than Richard Strauss does in his
appallingly arrogant self-portrait in Ein Heldenleben, but at least Strauss
composed a cogent musical defence. The score of Lelio comprises half-a-dozen
short and unconnected pieces, for which one suspects Berlioz wanted to find
a home.
At this concert the unlikely melange worked, thanks to the high standard of
the performance all-round. Vinson Cole was marvellously poetic in the
tenor's 'Song of bliss'. Francois Le Roux, the idiomatic baritone, made a
lively brigand. The Brighton Festival Chorus excelled itself in the closing
Fantasia on Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. Above all, Ozawa and the Boston
musicians created marvels of orchestral delicacy and refinement, enough
perhaps to make Lelio a showpiece as well.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Arts: Mother Courage - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any actress worth her salt must have a longing to play Mother Courage: it is
one of the most testing parts in European drama. And the first comment on
Ellie Haddington's performance in the new production of Bertholt Brecht's
play at the Cottesloe is that she passes the test summa cum laude.
Ms Haddington is magnificent. She never flags. She keeps her boots on till
the end. Sometimes she is exuberant and looks as if she should be playing in
Cabaret. For a woman condemned to the road, she goes through some remarkable
changes of dress: always peasant-like, but never quite the same. Her facial
expressions are wonderful. The highest compliment one can pay her is to
wonder occasionally if she is not too good for the piece.
Directors, too, must enjoy keeping the cart on the road. Mother Courage and
Her Children is, after all, one of the great epic plays. If you want theatre
about war, this is it. The trouble is that like the 30 years conflict that
it covers, Mother Courage is rather a relentless work. There are limits to
how many times one wants to see it: perhaps every five years at the most.
For the play does not easily lend itself to re-interpretation: it is simply
about Mother Courage ploughing on through the futility of war. The challenge
lies in how well it is done.
The previous mainstream London production was at the Mermaid four years ago
with Glenda Jackson playing the leading role. Ms Jackson took a hands-on
approach, pulling the cart about herself. At the Cottesloe, the cart seldom
moves, though it is switched from one side of the stage to the other during
the interval. Only at the very end does Ms Haddington give a pull of her own
volition, and that is when she is left without her offspring.
People come to the cart for its brandy, warmth and company rather than the
cart going out to find people. I think that the Cottesloe approach is more
effective, but that is an entirely personal judgment and perhaps the
Cottesloe had no choice since it has a smaller stage.
The new factor since Ms Jackson played the part is the break-up of
Yugoslavia. This is where Anthony Clark's direction at the Cottesloe
deserves the greatest praise. It resists the temptation to impose
comparisons between what is happening in Bosnia now and the 30 years' war in
the 17th-century. It lets the play speak for itself. Sometimes the best
prizes go to those who exercise discretion. Here is one of them. Clark
allows the audience to draw its own conclusions. Would that there were more
directors like him.
One final compliment. I did not realise till the end that the piece is
played with a cast of only eight. This is a remarkable achievement over such
a time-span and such a range of characters.
If one sounds slightly jaundiced about the play, spare a thought for the
critic who has seen the most intense of Strindberg (The Great Highway at the
Gate) and the most intense of Brecht on almost successive nights. Tomorrow
is off to fresh fields and pastures new with a little known play by Oliver
Goldsmith called The Good Natured Man at the Orange Tree in Richmond.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Arts: Different ways of going over the top - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One really enjoyable series can be all it takes to banish boredom with
television. To Play The King is currently serving this function and
brightening up everything remarkably. Some have complained that it is more
far-fetched than the original series, House Of Cards, and accused it of
'going over the top' which is a bit like complaining that The Bill is
preoccupied with police procedure. Of course it goes over the top, that is
its purpose and its charm. But since it was in House Of Cards that Ian
Richardson's diamond-hard schemer of a politician established his habit of
delivering Shakespearian asides, and in that same series that he shoved his
young mistress off the roof of the House of Commons, it is difficult to
sustain the argument that a story which began staid and sober has now become
ludicrous.
Its strength comes from the fact that, although its comedy is achieved by
exaggeration in the manner of a caricature, it is not all that far removed
from reality. When you remember such recent stories as the cabinet minister
parading before his mistress in Chelsea strip, the princess cavorting
topless with her financial advisor, and the prince on the telephone musing
on the desirability of being his lady friend's tampon . . . well, parody
becomes problematical. As for the po-faced protests that this television
drama damages the royal family, the reverse seems true. The king, whose
identity cannot be in doubt once you see how Michael Kitchen has captured
Charles' nose-stroking mannerism, is just as clearly the hero as Francis
Urquhart is the villain. Surely only those with a defective sense of humour
or an exaggerated idea of the fragility of the British constitution could
take such complaints seriously. It is a splendid romp combining in the
modern idiom the healthy ridicule of Rowlandson with the political
shenanigans of Trollope.
It is difficult to imagine such a series being made by the new ITV. The days
of larger than life characters such as Lew Grade and Sidney Bernstein at the
helm of the ITV companies have gone. Those men were fascinated by the
business of creating programmes, but their successors seem to be obsessed
with a programme for creating business. Given that many of these new chaps,
unlike the ITV knights of old, actually rose from the ranks of programme
makers, this is a little ironic.
In British television today there seems to be a fixation on the idea of
creating broadcasting companies big enough to compete in the international
market place. Everybody is asking 'If LWT bids for Yorkshire, what happens
to Tyne Tees?' or 'When Carlton takes over Central what will happen to the
share price?' We are even being urged to think about scrapping the licence
fee (one of the best bargains in Britain) and turning the BBC over to
commercial operation because that would create a world-class player on the
broadcasting stage. What nobody bothers to ask is 'What would this
concentration on size and commerce mean in programme terms for the British
audience?' Presumably the reason they do not ask is because the answer is
obvious: programmes would get worse. ITV programmes have already got worse
as a result of the Thatcherite licensing revolution, and there is not much
doubt that even more Thatcherism would mean even worse programmes. In this
context 'worse' is used in the same sense as in the sentence 'Hamburgers and
tabloid newspapers though popular are worse than what they replaced'.
What we shall probably come to expect from ITV are series such as A Woman's
Guide To Adultery with a come-on title and a cast that will attract foreign
buyers: Amanda Donohoe, Theresa Russell, even Sean Bean. If you point out
that the acting from people who have previously proved themselves more than
competent is consistently poor here, and that this suggests weakness in the
direction, and you add that the whole thing looks like a 60-minute
commercial for Gold Blend, you must expect sneers from the new ITV
mandarins. Why all this elitist whining, they will ask, what is wrong with
the sort of drama that ordinary people like? And they will quote the ratings
at you as proof that everything is all right. Point out that ITV used to
make drama such as Jewel In The Crown and The Naked Civil Servant,
Brideshead Revisited and Muck And Brass which between them managed to win
high ratings and a high degree of respect, and they will smile
contemptuously and refer to cloud cuckoo land.
The use of the word 'woman's' in a title which refers to sex is no mere
flash in the pan. Another of ITV's new series is Hollywood Women which last
week showed us 'Glitz And Glamour', and tomorrow promises 'Sex And Success'.
Episode 1 proved in one respect to be better than the advance publicity
might have suggested: in its second half it offered a re-run of the familiar
old plaint about Tinseltown's love of eternal youth. We had another look at
the results of plastic surgery so memorably covered previously in programmes
such as Whicker's World. In other respects, however, the programme was even
worse than expected, notably the hysterical rapidity with which cuts
occurred: it appeared to be determined to establish not a 3-minute but a
30-second culture.
Sex was also the subject of last week's 40 Minutes on BBC2, an astonishing
programme which you might have thought would cause a national furore. After
boasting about how many women they had laid (though they used the 'f' word)
and in precisely what manner, one male chauvinist pig said to the other 'My
woman's going to be faithful when I get married, otherwise I'll get a
cleaver and cut off her tits while she's asleep and make her eat them'. Is
that vile and disgusting or what? There is one deliberate error in this
report, however: it was actually two women boasting about their conquests,
and one said to the other 'My man's going to be faithful when I get married,
otherwise I'll get a cleaver and cut off his dick while he's asleep and make
him eat it'. So that is OK, isn't it? No need for a furore.
The same goes for comedian Jo Brand. Hers is the sort of comedy, we are
told, which is simply the feminist equivalent of the anti-female material
dished out for years by people such as Bernard Manning and Benny Hill. But
that is rubbish. Manning and Hill told jokes about mothers-in-law and
landladies, but they were about relationships or callings whereas Brand's
material is just malice directed at men. It would be considered wholly
unacceptable on television if this was Joe Brand and he was directing
similar hate-filled stuff ('Men should be allowed to carry shotguns and
shoot women when they like') at women.
But perhaps the reasons are becoming clear. Three weeks ago on Have I Got
News For You Jo Brand told us that she used to work as a nurse in a mental
hospital. Two weeks ago in Notes And Queries she made the claim again. Then
she repeated it on last week's South Bank Show and reiterated it on this
week's. Apparently this is something she sees as deeply significant. Maybe
her previous work has given her a very odd view of life and the human race,
but the main point remains: if this was a man spitting out such loathing for
the opposite sex he would promptly be excluded from television.

FT  08 DEC 93 / People: Freshfields attracts more foreign blood to its
partnership council
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Freshfields, the international law firm that invited Sir John Nott on to its
partnership council in 1991, has persuaded Herbert Jacobi, chairman of the
managing partners of investment bank Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt in Dusseldorf, to
become its second non-executive member, thereby adding an extra European
perspective to the deliberations of the strategy forum.
The introduction came via Peter Opitz, a partner in Freshfields' Frankfurt
office. Opitz knew Jacobi from the 1970s when both had been managing
partners of BHF Bank, the merchant bank. A Frenchman, the managing partner
of Freshfields' Paris office, its largest overseas operation, already sits
on the council.
John Grieves, Freshfields' senior partner, found Jacobi 'awfully likeable
and very experienced'. He says the presence of outsiders 'helps us to dilute
our insularity'. Few law firms have such an arrangement, and Grieves
remembers the concerns voiced in his own stable before Nott joined. 'We were
initially worried that the presence of non-executive members might alter the
whole nature of the debate. We also wondered whether the job would actually
be sufficiently interesting for them.'
Freshfields has been after Jacobi for a long time; talks were suspended when
HSBC Holdings acquired Midland, which owns 70 per cent of T&amp;B, causing
Jacobi to be more than thoroughly occupied bedding down the new
relationship. The council meets for a whole day four times a year.
A native American who is half German, he worked with Chase Manhattan Bank
before joining BHF. As well as being president of the Dusseldorf stock
exchange, he is a non-executive director of Gillette, of Braun, its German
subsidiary, and of Amtrol.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: A taste for green chips -
Investors are taking more notice of the world around them, but not at the
expense of profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given a choice between helping the environment and making money, most
members of the financial community would choose the latter.
But they are being forced to take more notice of the world around them as
environmental issues move from the fringes of the investment world to the
centre. The proponents of greener decision-making argue that it is in the
financial sector's interests to take more notice of such issues, thus
reducing environmental risk in their own transactions and helping to
preserve the environment.
Those urging change cite US government research showing that a company's
share price drops by an average of 0.43 per cent - small but noticeable - in
the week after the announcement of an environmental violation. More
severely, insurance companies have felt the impact of global warming, blamed
for much of the windstorm damage which has cost them Dollars 44bn (Pounds
29bn) since 1987.
The pressure for change in the financial arena comes from several
directions. In Europe, there are moves to make investors and lenders
responsible for some of the environmental liabilities of their clients. The
biggest worry centres on extended legal liability for environmental damage.
Alarm at the huge but unquantifiable risks this might bring is motivating
some business and financial groups to push for a new approach. Among these
are: the government's Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment
(ACBE); Business in the Environment, backed by Prince Charles; and the
Geneva-based Business Council for Sustainable Development (which represented
world business at the Rio Summit).
Further pressure comes from several influential pension funds - especially
in the US but increasingly in the UK - which are starting to question the
environmental performance of companies in which they invest. Environmental
campaigners, from single-issue groups to influential organisations such as
Greenpeace, are also beginning to turn their attention to financial
managers.
Fisons of the UK stopped extracting peat from areas of scientific interest
after a campaign by environmentalists. Three months ago, UK fund managers
received an environmental analysis from groups criticising a flotation by
Barito Pacific, an Indonesian timber company.
Stimulating environmentalists' interest in the financial sector is their
belief that their organisations can influence those obtaining loans,
investments and insurance. Many in the financial community, however, reject
accusations that they ignore the environment.
'We take the environment very seriously. After all, the UK insurance
industry is on line for thousands of millions of dollars of liability,' says
Francis de Zulueta, chairman of the Financial Institutions Environment
Liability Development Group, linking UK insurers.
'These issues are now taken incredibly seriously and there is a much greater
awareness of the risks and costs,' says Derek Wanless, group chief executive
of National Westminster bank and chairman of ACBE. But while banks and
insurers might be aware of the potential liabilities, especially from past
pollution incidents and contaminated land, investors are less convinced by
arguments that they should be more choosy about which companies they select.
'There is certainly a feeling that because there are lots of costs and risks
related to the environment, those businesses who understand it will
benefit,' adds Wanless. 'But investors feel there is little direct evidence
that environmental attitudes work through to give clear business benefits.'
'We are willing to take environmental issues seriously, but the risks and
rewards can take years to appear and can be difficult to measure,' says
Eleanor Burton of Mercury Asset Management. Moreover, even if investment
managers wanted to include a bigger range of green issues in their
decision-making, they do not have the tools and information (see
accompanying feature). Companies have few obligations to report on their
environmental liabilities and the emerging practice of reporting on
environmental performance (such as reductions in plant emissions) has yet to
produce evidence that markets can use.
This could change if governments made companies report in a standard,
comparable format or investors made similar requests; both seem unlikely.
There is, however, evidence that financial auditors are beginning to shift
away from a purely historical perspective towards one of viability.
But change is slow in accountancy. Although environmental reporting is the
subject of voluntary initiatives in Europe and the US, the results are
unlikely to be immediately useful to the financial community.
'The EC's fifth action plan on the environment talks about changing the
whole basis of accounting, but nobody appears to be doing anything about it
and there is a profound reluctance, especially in the UK, to take it on
board,' says Rob Gray, professor of accounting at Dundee University and
author of The Greening of Accountancy.
But the financial sector has clearly acknowledged that its risks have been
increased by bad or inadequate environmental performance. This realisation
has been largely driven by the threat of extended legal liability.
The insurance industry, nursing huge losses from US pollution claims, has
also reacted. Gradual pollution is now excluded from public liability
policies. 'And most direct insurers now have a hefty exclusion for pollution
liability from their re-insurers,' says de Zulueta.
But this reflects a purely negative response and the financial sector has
yet to do anything positive to create change. 'The insurance industry is
certainly in a strong position to influence clients and the businesses it
invests in,' says de Zulueta. 'But it would lose competitive advantage if it
was to select investments purely on environmental grounds.'
Jeremy Leggett, a climate change and insurance specialist at Greenpeace,
agrees that this would cause difficulties, but says it remains the ultimate
aim. Many campaigners say selective investment is too complex and could be
counter-productive. They feel a valuable first step is for investors to
impress upon managements of the companies in which they invest the need for
a sound environmental performance.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Financial markets count the
cost / Examining the need for a clear yardstick against which to measure
risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial markets have frequently been accused of ignoring the
environment. The accusation comes mainly from those who think bankers and
investors should play a more positive role in promoting environmental
values.
Is there any truth in the charge, and if so what should be done about it? It
is certainly the case that environmental factors make little impact on the
price of either credit or equity.
That much was admitted earlier this year when a group of financiers
appointed by the UK government to advise it on environmental issues
reported: 'Institutional investors have yet to focus fully on the value of
environmental data in assessing companies' prospects.'
But it would be wrong to say that the financial markets ignore the
environment completely. They have all suffered shocks of various kinds:
pollution disasters, green litigation, and the tidal wave of environmental
regulation which has swamped the corporate world. The point, however, is
that all these effects have been negative.
So far as the financial markets are concerned, the environment is all about
expense and annoyance. The more 'green' a company is, the more it is likely
to be loaded with environmental compliance costs.
Many companies claim their green investment gives them a competitive edge in
a world where regulation and public opinion favour environmentally sound
business. But the markets tend to ignore this 'upside' while doing
everything they can to avoid the downside. The green funds are a force
pushing in the opposite direction, but their goals are far from united, and
their impact is questionable.
The markets cannot be blamed for behaving as they do. They have no moral
obligation to support environmental values if they cannot perceive them.
This may be due to their short-sightedness, as many critics claim. But
hurling this charge at them will not convince them that greenery is good.
However, if markets are doing the natural thing in viewing the environment
largely in terms of risk, there is one important aspect in which they still
act against their own best interests. This is in failing to distinguish
between different levels of environmental risk.
The attitude is one of all or nothing. A company is able to secure pollution
insurance one day, only to find that owing to a new pollution law or some
environmental disaster, the market clams up the next. The same is true of
banks: the fear of environmental liability led thousands of US banks to shut
their doors to sensitive sectors like chemicals and petrol stations.
This is uncharacteristic of financial markets, where the ability to grade
risk is one of the driving forces behind prices. One of the main problems is
lack of information: it is hard for markets to make sophisticated judgments
when the information is absent or inconsistent, and when so much depends on
the vagaries of the law courts, regulators and consumers.
Some progress is being made through eco-auditing and the growing practice of
publishing environmental company reports. Attempts have also been made to
rate companies by how 'green' or environmentally benevolent they are. But
these ratings are of little use to the mainstream markets which only want to
know whether a company's environmental liabilities will cost them money.
What the markets really need is a clear yardstick against which to measure
environmental risk and rate companies according to the danger of
environment-related loss. Such a scheme can be envisaged. It would have to
address two basic questions about the company being rated.
The first is, how large are its environmental liabilities? This would be
answered by combining the growing body of publicly available information
(pollution registers, court actions, eco-audits etc.) with a judgment about
the quality of a company's environmental controls.
The second is how well placed is the company to absorb environment-related
losses? This would be answered by reference to the overall strength of the
company. Thus a company with large environmental liabilities but a strong
balance sheet might earn a high rating - which would upset environmentalists
but provide the financial markets with the information they needed.
Some people will doubtless dismiss such a scheme as superfluous because the
markets would automatically discount these risks - if analysts and credit
rating agencies were doing a proper job.
Not necessarily. The point about the environment is that it represents a
body of pressures - regulatory, legal, political - based on a common set of
values which move independently from normal economic forces: an economic
recovery could be accompanied by a regulatory crackdown on pollution, for
example.
There are enormous technical obstacles in creating such a scheme, not least
who would operate it and pay for it. It will also strike many as a negative
way of addressing an issue which is essentially about 'good' values. But the
obstacles are not insuperable, and if the scheme identified environmentally
risky companies more clearly and priced them accordingly, it follows that
sound companies would benefit.

<TEXT>
Sir David Plastow, who took over as chairman of Inchcape in September 1992,
has decided to reduce his range of outside directorships and will step down
as a non-executive director of Cable and Wireless at the end of the month.
Sir David, who is also deputy chairman of Guinness, the TSB and BUPA as well
as being chairman of the Medical Research Council, joined the board of Cable
and Wireless in 1991. Some six months later he was asked to take over the
chairmanship of Inchcape following the death of Sir George Turnbull.
Inchcape, an international services group, operates in over 80 countries and
Sir David's job entails a great deal of overseas travel - which explains his
decision to resign the directorship of Cable and Wireless. He stepped down
from the board of Tenneco, the US conglomerate, last year.
His seat on the Cable and Wireless board is being taken by a former
colleague - Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce (above). Both Sir
David and Sir Ralph started their business careers in different parts of the
Rolls-Royce empire in the mid-1950s. Sir David came up through Rolls-Royce
Motors and Sir Ralph made his name on the aero engine side of the business.
After Rolls-Royce was bailed out by the government in the 1970s, their
careers diverged.
Although they both remain good friends and are of the same age, Cable and
Wireless stressed that the appointment of Robins was a coincidence. Sir
Ralph, 61, had been vetted by Cable and Wireless's nominations committee and
he had been interviewed by all the non-executive directors. He will join the
board next April.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Management: Prognosis for sick pay - Last week's Budget
should inspire companies to explore new ways of reducing absenteeism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managements in the UK last week were given the sharpest of nudges to look
hard at their sick pay policies. The prompt came in the Budget announcement
that the government plans to abolish the 80 per cent reimbursement of large
employers' statutory sick pay costs from next April.
While some companies may choose to cut their sick pay benefits, most will
probably do as the chancellor suggested and use the removal of SSP as an
incentive to improve their management of sick leave and to take greater
interest in the health of their employees.
At present employers pay SSP for up to 28 weeks to employees who are sick
for at least four days in a row. Two rates are payable. Employees earning
Pounds 195 a week or more are paid at a weekly rate of Pounds 52.50.
Employees earning between Pounds 56 and Pounds 195 are paid Pounds 46.95 a
week.
These payments will from next April be borne entirely from the company's own
resources, although overall the reductions in employers' national insurance
contributions should more than absorb this cost.
Smaller companies got a better deal in the Budget. In regulations to be laid
after the passage of the Statutory Sick Pay bill, companies with annual
National Insurance contributions of less than Pounds 20,000 will be able to
recover 100 per cent of statutory sick pay after four weeks of an employee's
illness.
In practice most big companies top up statutory sick pay. Some have schemes
which pay three months' full pay and three months' half pay. Better schemes
tend to give six months' full pay and six months' half pay.
Some companies have introduced incentive and bonus schemes to try to cut
absenteeism from sickness, which cost UK business Pounds 13bn in 1992
according to a report published in May. The report, 'Too Much Time Out?' by
the CBI in association with consultants Percom, said each worker lost an
average of eight working days because of sickness in 1992, representing 3.5
per cent of working time. The absence rate was higher among full-time manual
workers, who lost twice as much time as full-time non-manual workers.
This discrepancy has led to difficulties in harmonising sick pay schemes at
some companies. Traditionally, clerical staff receive full pay from day one
when they take time off for sickness but unless companies have a top-up
scheme, blue-collar workers are not compensated for the first three days of
absence before they can draw statutory sick pay.
British Gypsum, which harmonised its schemes in 1989, saw absentee rates
rise from 4 1/2 per cent among manual workers to 14 per cent at some sites.
The company reverted to two schemes. But it introduced an incentive element
to allow manual workers to cross over to the clerical scheme after a
five-month qualification period. If they are absent for no more than two
periods totalling two days each they will automatically be taken on to the
staff scheme. 'The idea is that we are working towards full harmonisation
but it has been better to do it gradually,' says the company. Now overall
absence rates are down to 3 1/2 per cent.
Vauxhall, the UK car maker, has reduced its sickness absenteeism from 8.8
per cent in 1986 to 4.5 per cent today. This was after the company
introduced a negotiated incentive scheme which saved employees about Pounds
4 a week in contributions to the company sick pay scheme if average levels
of sick leave could be kept at or below 5 per cent.
Iveco Ford in Slough introduced an incentive scheme two years ago after
sickness absence levels among hourly paid workers had reached 7 per cent.
The company set targets for reducing rates across the workforce which would
trigger the introduction of sickness payments for the third, second and
finally the first day of sickness.
'For the five months up to the end of November the rate has been 2.8 per
cent so it is looking like we might make the target at the end of December
when the rate is reviewed,' says John Eskdale, personnel manager of the
company's industrial operations. 'The big test will come when we start
paying day one.'
Many personnel experts believe that discriminating between hourly paid
blue-collar workers and salaried staff is increasingly difficult to justify.
One of the best ways of producing immediate improvements, according to
Angela Baron, a policy adviser at the Institute of Personnel Management, is
for middle managers to monitor absenteeism. 'The experience of companies
that have started monitoring sickness absence is that the very fact that
they have started paying attention to it is enough to reduce the absence
rates in their companies,' she says.
Experts believe fear of unemployment has contributed to declines in
absenteeism in the UK, but there is strong evidence that management action
can deliver results. An Audit Commission study of 10 London councils in 1990
found sickness absence was averaging more than two and a half times the
national norm. A follow-up report earlier this year found that by monitoring
and managing absenteeism the councils had succeeded in cutting days off from
an annual average of 16.7 days per employee in 1990 to 11.5 days in 1991-92.
Many factors underlie improved absence records, but whether it is knowing
that someone in management cares or fearing that they are watching, both
approaches seem more effective than the alternative of managerial neglect.
Judging by the Swedish experience, government action can also be a powerful
stimulus. Removal of state sick pay for the first two weeks of absence in
Sweden this year led to shortages of flu vaccine as companies clamoured to
instigate vaccination programmes in order to keep down costs. Driven partly
by the rapid growth in unemployment Sweden's absenteeism has fallen in three
years from levels where three out of 10 workers were on sick leave at any
one time to less than one in 10 today.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Management: Life and times of the ditkies - Book Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
and his television producer wife, Prudence Keely, are happy ditkies (double
income, two kids). Other couples might be ground down by the demands of big
jobs and tiny tots, but these two find them rewarding and rejuvenating.
So much so that they have written a curiously positive foreword to The
Workplace Revolution*, a book which chronicles the woes of dual-career
couples. The opening anecdote tells of a chance meeting between Davies's
small son and his much-loved former nanny in a supermarket. The child was
unmoved, but the nanny burst into tears. This is meant to show that
preconceptions about childcare can be wide of the mark. Instead it leaves
the impression that Davies, Keely and family, unlike the other examples in
the book, are having it all and loving it.
The contention of the authors, Cary Cooper and Suzan Lewis, is that the way
in which people work has changed forever. More women work full time in areas
once dominated by men, and more return to work after having children. Men no
longer have full-time wives providing domestic support, and so are under
pressure to help at home.
Yet this is not another book about the problems for working mothers. The
wants and needs of both men and women are changing, yet most companies
expect their workers to behave as before. The result is conflict for all
sides.
Cooper and Lewis have interviewed 400 dual-career couples to find out where
the main areas of friction lie. These turn out to be many and various: the
working day is too long, and the macho work ethic too entrenched. Couples
find their schedules are inflexible. They find the cares of work are
spilling over into home time, and domestic concerns are getting in the way
of work.
When children arrive the problems get worse. Women find themselves missing
out on promotion and feeling constant guilt. Every time the child gets ill
or something goes wrong, the load of guilt increases.
The book bristles with examples of each of these well-known problems. Sally
works in a big department store where staff need written permission from two
managers in order to leave early. She lives in constant terror of being
unable to respond quickly should her child fall ill.
While the problems sound all too common, what is less familiar is the
variety of ways in which couples cope. The book contains many examples of
new men - rather more than one meets in real life - ensuring that the
strains are shared equally. One London-based small business- woman persuaded
her husband not to accept a job in Scotland on the understanding that next
time it would be her turn to be flexible. Another couple, Lynda and John,
share a job as social workers and take it in turns to look after the
children.
Despite these examples, the authors do not pretend that everyone should be
like Lynda and John. Indeed they believe that there is no right way to
handle the pressures. They argue that unless organisations change their
ways, these problems will not go away, no matter how many new men there are.
They have drawn up a shopping list of corporate policies which would help.
Companies should conduct stress audits and discourage workaholic behaviour.
More important, they should recognise the value of giving people increased
control over the number of hours they work, which means they should place
greater trust in their employees. Companies should offer more training in
time management, assertiveness and stress management. They should accept
that family decisions are a part of career planning.
Above all, what is needed is a rethink of what constitutes the ideal
employee and the ideal career pattern. All change in attitudes takes time,
yet the authors are optimistic that change is possible, indeed inevitable.
Cooper and Lewis put forward the standard argument that it is in an
employer's economic interests to have an unstressed workforce. Yet they seem
to assume that the list can be bought for nothing. A more persuasive
argument for change may be needed, especially at a time in which companies
are loading extra demands on their workers.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Jobs: How shut-outs differ from drop-outs - Student
success-rates cast doubt on universities' protests about government policy
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gorblimey] Can it be that a British government has at last decided that a
sacred cow of 30 years' standing is largely bull? The protean creature
concerned is degree-level education which has grown to absorb almost 10 per
cent of the Pounds 32.3bn yearly public cost of education as a whole.
What return taxpayers receive on their Pounds 3bn outlays for degree studies
is another question. It has rarely been asked, let alone answered, by the
country's leaders since the growth policy was first recommended by the
Robbins Committee, 30 days before President Kennedy died in Dallas.
The committee itself evidently just assumed that producing more graduates
would automatically improve Britain's economic performance, besides making
for a more civilised society in general. And the non-appearance of the said
benefits did not deter a succession of governments from continuing the
growth, albeit irregularly, so that the number of full-time students today
stands at a million in the round.
Then suddenly last week the policy was thrown into reverse by the budget,
which ordains that the intake of new undergraduates must be cut by 3.5 per
cent next year. Whether that means John Major and company have tired of
waiting for the promised benefits and are preparing the beast for protracted
slaughter, who but themselves can tell? The issue is so potentially
explosive that no ambitious politician would admit having any such
intention, whatever the truth of the matter might be.
Either way, universities are resisting the change with protests, and not
only because it's a poor reward to them for raising staff productivity by 30
per cent in four years. The cut is senseless when white-collar jobs are
scarce, they say, since it means that no fewer than 10,000 people who could
otherwise have been admitted to degree studies, will now have to be turned
away.
With due respect to the universities, however, their readiness to quote
figures on student admissions contrasts sharply with their statistical
shyness on an allied question. It is: how many of the undergraduates who
start their courses, quit them without obtaining a degree?
While the existence of drop-outs is now at least acknowledged in an annual
report, it presents the data in a way far from user-friendly to taxpayers.
Indeed, the figures are at once both so re-stricted and so complicated that
the number of students who fail to complete their courses can only be
estimated, not least because the document neglects to state how many started
out. Moreover the information applies solely to the 40-odd older
universities, so the former polytechnics lately elevated to the same title
are left out of account.
Even so, drop-out rates are surely important enough for approximations to be
better than no indications at all. Hence the table below which refers to
students who ended their undergraduate courses, either with or without
gaining a degree, during the three years 1990-92. Each university's name is
followed by the estimated total of such students, and next by the actual
number who were successful, which is given in the report.
Then comes a double complication. Not only does the mix of subjects taught
vary from one campus to another, but different kinds of studies present
differing levels of difficulty to the students taking them. Among the 20
separate groups of subjects listed in the data, the country-wide success
rates range from 81 per cent for architecture and suchlike to 91 per cent
for business and administration. But neither the campus-to-campus variances
nor the difficulty differences are allowed for in the figures headed
'drop-out rate' which accordingly, as well as being estimates, are an unfair
measure to judge any individual university by.
A better yardstick is the plus or minus score that follows, which does allow
for the variances. It is arrived at by giving each campus a 'target'
consisting of the number of drop-outs it would have if its students had
conformed to the national averages for the particular groups of subjects
they studied. The target is then compared with the estimated number of
drop-outs, which I feel confident is in no case badly astray. For example,
the estimate for Cambridge is 241 - 861 or 78 per cent better than its
target of 1,102. Salford is the opposite with a target of 588, and an
estimate 77 per cent worse at 1,043.
But in the light of government policy, individual differences are less
salient than the overall figures. There, the gap between the actual
successes and the estimated total is 31,676 - three times as many drop-outs
just from the older universities as the number of new entrants the whole lot
of institutions are complaining they will collectively have to turn away.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Budgets vary for health authorities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Health authority budgets in England are to rise by an average of 5.33 per
cent next year, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, announced
yesterday.
All 14 health regions will receive a real-terms increase but they will range
from more than 2 per cent to as low as 0.7 per cent, particularly in London
areas of falling population.
Doctors in the north-west will get an increase of more than 10 per cent in
real terms while those in East Anglia, Wessex, South Western and North-West
Thames will be given a standstill budget.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Equality chief to quit a year early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Valerie Amos, chief executive of the Equal Opportunity Commission, is
leaving her job a year before the end of her contract to pursue other
interests.
Ms Amos, who came to the job four years ago from local government, succeeded
in putting the commission on a more structured footing with stronger
management and making it more accessible to grassroots organisations and
ethnic minorities.
She is understood, however, to have some difficulty developing a strong
personal relationship with Ms Kamlesh Bahl who took over the commission's
chair in June.
Ms Amos resigned the post almost a month ago. No announcement was made,
although a short briefing was prepared in the event of possible press
inquiries.
Ms Bahl, who worked as a lawyer in industry before tasking up her
appointment, said in the briefing that Ms Amos had worked with 'great
dedication and loyalty to bring about many changes for the EOC'.
Ms Amos was yesterday anxious to play down suggestions that a personality
clash had been a key factor in her decision to leave. 'That kind of thing is
always said when there is a new chair. Kamlesh and I have worked very well
together. I wouldn't describe our working relationship as a difficult one.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Payments slowdown squeezes exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British exporters are having to wait longer for payment from customers on
the Continent, the Association of British Factors and Discounters said
yesterday. Many settlements were taking more than four months, an
association survey revealed.
The survey showed that Italian companies have replaced the French as the
slowest European payers, settling invoices in an average of 130 days
compared with 95 days a year ago. Normal payment terms in Italy are 60 to 90
days.
French companies paid on average after 121 days, six days more slowly than
they did last year.
The study lends support to the frequently cited theory that recession
encourages late payment. The record of German companies, which are normally
considered prompt payers but are suffering from recession, also
deteriorated. They settled on average after 55 days compared with 50 days
last year.
By contrast UK companies are paying more quickly as the economic recovery
gathers pace. Payments were received by the ABFD's members in an average 59
days compared with 62 days last year.
Mr Ben Allen, chairman of the ABFD, said: 'It is ironic that just as the
picture starts to improve for British companies at home their struggle to
get paid abroad gets tougher.'
The study is compiled by a group of leading European factoring companies
which advance cash to companies against unpaid invoices.
Italy, France and Spain emerge as the European countries with the worst
bad-debt record. Italy had bad debts equal to 4 per cent of sales in 1993,
France 3 per cent and Spain 2.5 per cent.
Dutch companies were the promptest payers, settling after 50 days compared
with 45 days a year ago with normal payment terms of 30 days.
The lowest bad-debt rates were in Switzerland and the UK. These two
countries were the least bad payers after the Netherlands.
The smallest companies appear to be worst hit. The association said: 'Profit
margins are being squeezed because many European customers are now offering
payment on time only if their suppliers accept sizeable discounts.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Abbey trims mortgage rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the UK's second-largest mortgage lender, yesterday cut its
mortgage rates by 0.25 percentage points to a range between 7.54 and 7.74
per cent.
It said that the reduction - less than that announced by Halifax Building
Society on Monday - reflected the fact that falling interest rates were bad
news for savers.
Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest society, followed Halifax, the
largest, by announcing a cut of 0.35 percentage points to 7.64 per cent in
its variable rate.
Other main lenders joining Abbey in the smaller cut of 0.25 points were
Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, and Midland Bank. The series of
cuts has been triggered by a pre-Budget 0.5 percentage point reduction in
base rates.
The new rates will be available immediately to new borrowers, and to
existing borrowers from January.
Mr Chris Chadwick, Leeds executive director, echoed the warning from other
societies that if the government subsidised its savings products to attract
investors, then societies might not be able to pass on to borrowers further
cuts in interest rates. He said: 'Over-aggressive pricing on national
savings will impact on lenders' ability to maintain current rates or reduce
them any further.'
Many mortgage lenders have not announced new rates for savers, but are
likely to do so before the end of the month.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Weighting thin on the ground: Changes in civil service terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The abolition of the London weighting allowances paid to civil servants
comes after a period in which most businesses have frozen the additional
payments they make to staff working in the capital.
The fall in demand for staff in the recession has put an end to the boom in
London allowances, paid to workers such as nurses, police officers, bank and
West End shop staff. In the 1980s allowances reached Pounds 3,000 or more a
year for some London staff, to meet recruitment and retention needs.
Allowances in most of the clearing banks have not increased since 1989 or
1990. The civil service has frozen allowances for most of its staff since
1988. BT has not reviewed allowances since 1991 and will not again until
next year.
Many employers are freezing or abolishing additional supplements brought in
during the boom years. Businesses have increasingly taken a more targeted
approach, paying premiums to attract workers to new locations such as
Bristol.
This is the approach which the civil service intends to follow with its new
recruitment and retention allowance, aimed at specific groups in offices
with recruitment difficulties.
London First, the private-sector lobby group set up to promote the capital,
is among the growing band of organisations that believe London allowances,
which can add an extra Pounds 3,000 to an individual's annual pay, should be
abolished. A report from its economic development team said in October:
'Institutionalised 'London weighting' payments provide a disincentive to
retain jobs in the capital.' British Telecommunications is considering
moving thousands of office jobs out of central London over the next few
years. The relocation could save the company up to Pounds 44m in London
weighting.
Mr Alastair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the independent research
organisation, said much of current practice on London allowances dated from
the 1974 Pay Board report for civil servants.
The board recommended London weighting allowances to ensure comparability of
real earnings for people working in London and those working elsewhere.
Following a survey of living costs, the board recommended a Pounds 400
allowance for an inner London zone extending up to four miles from Charing
Cross and a Pounds 200 allowance for an outer zone covering the remaining
London boroughs.
The allowances were to be reviewed each year in line with indices published
by the Department of Employment, which monitored relative changes to the
cost of living in London. Mr Hatchett said these covered housing, travel,
wear and tear and other costs.
Publication of these figures ended in 1982, with the government arguing that
an employer's ability to pay and not cost compensation should be the main
determinant of geographical pay relativities. Since then private-sector
employers and the government have made their own calculations.
Employers still justify the need for the payments in terms of labour-market
needs. BT said: 'BT sees London weighting as a market supplement to attract
and retain staff and it has not increased the allowance recently as it has
had no problems recruiting.'
Bifu, the banking union, said employers felt they had a justification not to
increase rates when they did not have recruitment problems.
As to the future? Mr Hatchett said: 'I can see there is likely to be
downward pressure on the market-related part of the allowance but
compensating people for either the cost of living in London or travelling in
to work is clearly still important to many workers.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Heseltine boosts business-aid cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday announced
a number of initiatives to help industry and small businesses.
He used his speech in the final day of the Budget debate in the Commons to
announce an increase from Pounds 14m to Pounds 17m in start-up funding for
Business Link outlets.
The outlets are designed to bring together under one roof most of the
services provided by training and enterprise councils, chambers of commerce,
local authorities, enterprise agencies, and other private-sector
organisations.
The first of a planned national network have opened in Birmingham,
Leicester, and Congleton in Cheshire. Mr Heseltine said Tecs - which deliver
government training schemes in England and Wales - 'have a key strategic
role in organising the provision of business support services'.
Tecs' budgets for services to small businesses - most of which will be taken
into Business Link outlets - is to increase slightly to Pounds 33m.
Mr Heseltine also announced an environmental technology best-practice
programme, worth Pounds 16m, and a new Link programme on surface
engineering.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said spending by Mr
Heseltine's department would drop by some 12 per cent in real terms in the
next three years, and this reflected the falling investment in Britain's
manufacturing industry.
'Out of 18 spending departments, the DTI is 17th,' said Mr Cook. 'Britain
provides less support to industry than any other European country.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Smithfield tenants defeated at polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tenants of the Smithfield meat market were defeated yesterday in elections
for the Corporation of London's general council.
In nine wards which held competitive elections, they were out-voted, while a
further election was ordered for next year on procedural grounds in the
Bassishaw ward, where Smithfield tenants had appeared certain to win at
least two seats.
At the 'ward mote' last Friday, where candidates announce their intention to
stand for election, the Smithfield candidates for the Bassishaw ward were
deemed to have made multiple applications for different wards.
The corporation said that their withdrawals from other wards had not been
properly conducted.
The Smithfield tenants had run as part of a campaign against what they say
are unfairly high rents being charged by the corporation to pay for the
Pounds 60m refurbishment of the market required by new European Union
regulations.
The Smithfield losses lessen the chances of change to the franchise. This is
restricted to the City's few residents, partnerships and sole traders and is
hence vulnerable to abuse from single-issue campaigns, particularly in those
wards that have less than 100 voters.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Insurers are warned on genetic tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance companies were urged yesterday not to require people to disclose
the results of genetic tests until the UK has an agreed national policy on
the use of genetic information.
But the Association of British Insurers said the proposed moratorium was
unnecessary because companies did not use genetic screening for life
insurance.
Launching Britain's first in-depth report on the ethics of genetic
screening, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics called on the government,
health professionals, employers and insurers to agree measures to protect
people 'against the potentially adverse effects of screening, including the
misuse of confidential information, the risk of social stigma and the
possibilities of eugenic abuse in the future'.
Action is urgent, the report says, because medical researchers are rapidly
developing simple genetic tests for inherited diseases ranging from cystic
fibrosis to some forms of cancer.
'It will soon be possible to screen for hundreds of diseases,' said Dr Peter
Harper, professor of medical genetics at the University of Wales, Cardiff,
and a member of the Nuffield committee - a group of scientists, doctors,
legal and ethical specialists.
Insurers already have a policy not to require applicants for life or health
policies to undergo special genetic tests. But the council wants companies
to go further and 'accept a temporary moratorium' on asking people to
disclose existing genetic information. Under the present policy, genetic
test results have to be declared.
Insurers say that in practice they do not make use of genetic information
acquired in screening programmes. And they are coming to appreciate that
genetic tests need to be treated differently from other medical information.
'The industry is still living down the myth that even a negative HIV test
makes it more difficult to obtain life insurance,' said Dr Mary Reynolds,
medical adviser to Canada Life Assurance. 'Life insurance should never be a
deterrent to genetic testing.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Guidelines issued on high-yield investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial service regulators are issuing guidance notes to member firms in
an attempt to prevent investors from being misled about high-income
products, especially where the 'income' may partly consist of the return of
capital.
High-income products have become popular in the past year as falling
interest rates have led investors to seek ways to replace income they
previously received from building societies. Some will not repay capital in
full unless conditions - such as stock market growth - are met.
Fimbra, the regulator for financial intermediaries, issued a guidance note
yesterday pointing out that 'if a rate of 'income' is offered which is
significantly higher than can be obtained by way of dividend or deposit
income, it will normally be the case that the higher return is obtained at
some risk to capital or at the expense of capital growth'. The regulator
said it was concerned that these risks were not being described to investors
in a manner which was 'clear, fair, and not misleading'.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Fiasco of Sundays may have had its chips / Review of the
shop-hours options open to MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sunday trading bill was supposed to be one of the most contentious
pieces of legislation to come before the Commons in the current session.
Tempers were expected to run so high that the government, bruised by a
successful backbench revolt on the issue in 1986, allowed a free vote.
It has not happened. The bill passed its second reading by a huge majority
after a polite debate last week and has almost disappeared from view, buried
by controversy over the Budget and the Ulster peace talks.
That may change today when MPs debate the core of the bill - three options
put forward by retailing and religious pressure groups to reform the widely
ignored 1950 Shops Act. The options are:
Complete de-regulation, bringing England and Wales into line with Scotland,
favoured by the Conservative right and backed by the prime minister, the
home secretary and a majority of the cabinet.
Unrestricted trading for small shops, with a six-hour limit on larger
stores. This was drafted by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which
represents big chains such as Tesco that already open on Sundays, in
defiance of the law. Unregulated opening for most small shops, DIY stores
and garden centres, and unregulated opening for four Sundays before
Christmas. This is backed by the Keep Sunday Special (KSS) campaign, an
alliance of small retailers and sabbatarians, and some big stores, including
Marks and Spencer and John Lewis.
There is broad agreement that the 1950 act is well past its sell-by date.
For example, fish and chips may be sold at a take-away outlet other than a
fish and chip shop, while fish and chip shops can sell any takeaway food
other than fish and chips.
But there is no consensus on which option, if any, will win. The least
likely outcome is de-regulation, which is opposed by a big majority on the
opposition benches. It would have to attract the votes of virtually all
Conservative MPs to succeed.
That is unlikely because of the strength of support among traditionalist
Conservatives for the KSS option. The KSS group is worried, however, by the
defection of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, once a strong supporter but now
backing the six-hours option.
The union's decision has split its 12 sponsored Labour MPs, some of whom
will stand by KSS. But many Labour MPs are likely to follow the union into
the six-hour lobby, which also has the support of the TGWU, the other union
representing shopworkers.
Both sides claim the support of a majority of MPs. But the first option to
attract a majority of votes cast will win, which means that the decision
might hinge on the order in which the speaker calls the options.
The provisional order - de-regulation, KSS, six-hours - appears to favour
the last option, if only because MPs are likely to want to resolve the issue
if the other two options have been defeated.
Further complicating the issue, Sir Peter Emery, a Conservative backbencher,
has tabled a series of amendments which would prevent trading on Sunday
mornings. The government says it is neutral on this approach.
It is possible that no option will win a majority. If that happens the
government will probably bring the least unpopular option back to the
Commons after giving MPs a few weeks to mull over the chaos they will have
caused. But it is a scenario which gives ministers nightmares.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Go-ahead expected for ITV takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons is expected to give the formal go-ahead tonight for a
fundamental change in the rules governing independent television.
Labour will try to block an order implementing the government's overhaul of
the licensing regime, but there is no realistic prospect of a Conservative
rebellion.
The order will facilitate two takeover offers tabled since the government's
plans were announced last week by Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary.
Carlton Communications, the London broadcaster, has agreed a merger with
Central, the Midlands company, and Granada, covering the north-west of
England, has made a Pounds 600m hostile bid for London Weekend Television.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's national heritage spokesman, will call for a
12-month extension to the existing moratorium on mergers.
She said the government's plans would make Britain the only European country
where foreign companies would be allowed to buy 100 per cent of regional
broadcasters.

The index, which is supposed to indicate economic turning points in activity

FT  08 DEC 93 / Treasury expects pause in recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's economic recovery could pause in the spring when tax increases
announced in last week's Budget take effect, Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's
chief economic adviser, said yesterday.
However, he told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that the
Budget, which will add Pounds 1.68bn to Pounds 6.73bn of tax rises already
planned for 1994-95, was not intended to be deflationary.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, decided to tighten fiscal policy to
ensure that the recovery continued, Mr Budd said. While there was
uncertainty over consumers' reaction to tax increases next April, the Budget
could have a positive effect on confidence. In addition, the 'very
considerable' fall in interest rates since September 1992 was having a
powerful effect on demand.
Mr Budd pointed out that consumer demand continued to grow after the
announcement of tax increases in Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget.
Nevertheless, he agreed with Mr Giles Radice, a Labour committee member,
that the tax increases announced in this year's two Budgets would have a
cumulative impact of Pounds 15bn to Pounds 17bn in 1996-97.
In forecasting growth of 2.5 per cent next year, rising to 3 per cent a year
by 1996-97, the Treasury expected investment and exports would play a bigger
role in supporting activity in later years, Mr Budd said.
MPs were told by Mr Paul Gray of the Treasury's monetary group that in spite
of the tax increases, the net funding requirement for the budget deficit
would be in the 'high 30s' of billions of pounds in 1994-95.
They also heard Mr Christopher Kelly, head of the Treasury's general
expenditure policy division, express only cautious optimism that the reduced
contingency reserve of Pounds 3.5bn in the spending plans for 1994-95 would
be adequate. The flow of orders to the west Midlands engineering industry
has slowed in the past three months, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The latest survey of business trends, conducted by the Engineering Employers
Federation West Midlands, shows that the proportion of companies
experiencing an increase in domestic orders fell to 37 per cent in November
from 46 per cent in May.

FT  08 DEC 93 / W Midland engineers see orders decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flow of orders to the west Midlands engineering industry from both home
and overseas has slowed down in the past three months and a declining
proportion of companies expect order books to grow in the next three months.
The latest survey of business trends, conducted by the Engineering Employers
Federation West Midlands just before the Budget and covering 494 companies,
demonstrates the shallowness of economic recovery and offers an antidote to
optimism.
Recent regional surveys had suggested that the west Midlands, with its
dependence on manufacturing, would be one of the regions to emerge from
recession most quickly.
Engineering employers reported yesterday that the proportion of companies
experiencing an increase in domestic orders fell to 37 per cent in November
from 46 per cent in May. Those experiencing a rise in export orders fell to
22 per cent from 27 per cent.
Twenty one per cent of companies expect a fall in capacity utilisation over
the next three months.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Tube wary of Eurotunnel saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first giant piles for the Canary Wharf Underground station on London's
Isle of Dogs are due to be sunk today, signalling the start of an enterprise
which will take more than four years to complete and provide employment for
22,000 workers.
Two days later, British and French contractors will take part in another
ceremony - to mark the handover of the Channel tunnel from the construction
companies to Eurotunnel, which will operate it when it finally opens next
spring.
London Underground will be hoping that it will not repeat Eurotunnel's
experience. The Channel tunnel is due to open almost a year later than
planned and will cost more than double its 1987 estimate of Pounds 4.7bn,
after interest payments.
The 10-mile Jubilee line extension, with 7 3/4 miles in twin single-track
tunnels, is a much smaller project than the 31-mile Channel tunnel. However,
it will still involve the disposal of 1.4m cubic metres of clay, sand and
gravel compared with more than 6m cu m removed from under the Channel.
Contractors are expected to use 22,500 precast concrete tunnel and shaft
linings, 8,000 iron linings, 500,000 cu m of concrete, 53,000 tonnes of
steel reinforcement, 4,900 tonnes of rail track and 57,000 rail sleepers.
Building materials and spoil will have to be moved through one of the
world's busiest capitals. Barges will transport much of the goods and up to
60 per cent of the spoil along the Thames.
Mr Hugh Doherty, project director on the Jubilee line extension, says
lessons have been learnt from other large railway tunnelling jobs including
the Channel tunnel and the Hong Kong and Singapore mass transit railways.
Most of the contracts for the Underground extension, signalling and rolling
stock, have been let to consortia containing companies from Britain, Japan,
Germany, France, the US and Canada. London Underground, however, says that
60 per cent of civil engineering and more than 80 per cent of mechanical and
electrical contracts have gone to UK companies.
The work has been divided into smaller packages, says Mr Doherty, 'partly
because different engineering skills were required for different aspects,
but also because it made overall management sense'.
It was important that contractors should have sufficient financial strength
to carry out their task without their balance sheets becoming
over-stretched. It was also important that London Underground could not be
held to ransom by a powerful single group of contractors.
The deep recession in UK and continental European construction markets made
it easy for the client to impose tougher conditions and prices.
Construction companies have complained bitterly about the imposition of
'on-demand' performance bonds which would allow Jubilee line managers to
demand up to 10 per cent of the value of a contract without having to prove
that the contractors were in default.
Conciliation procedures have been established to resolve any differences
should changes to agreed design specifications be needed.
The long delays in agreeing finance for the project allowed London
Underground time to prepare designs and complete ground-condition studies
which should reduce the need for contract vari-ations.
The mix of clays, sands and gravels through which the track passes - up to
100 feet below the surface - will demand a variety of tunnelling techniques
on different parts of the line.
London clay, impervious to water, is very good for tunnelling whereas
tunnels passing through Thanet sands can become waterlogged very quickly.
Thames Water almost lost a tunnel-boring machine worth several million
pounds when it unexpectedly broke through clay into Thanet sand while
digging the London ring main in the late 1980s. The surrounding land had to
be frozen so that the machine could be dug out.
To prevent settlement, engineers will pump a cement grout, often mixed with
bentonite, into the ground above and ahead of where the tunnel is being dug.
Surveys of more than 3,000 buildings are being undertaken to make sure the
right construction techniques are used and that properties will not be
damaged.
Some Pounds 200m has been spent even before construction starts this week.
London Underground will hope its preparations bring peace of mind.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Four-year ride past decay in Docklands: Construction will
start today on the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee line extension linking east London
to the West End
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gateway to the Jubilee line extension, the flagship transport project
for the London Docklands, is marked by a pile of rubble in one of the
capital's poorest areas.
The hoarding around the site - derelict for eight years - gives no clue that
by the turn of the century this will be Bermondsey Underground station,
capable of handling 4,000 passengers an hour. There are no planning notices
or developers' advertisements, just graffiti urging residents to 'Vote BNP'.
This is the boundary between Bermondsey and the 5,000 acres controlled by
the London Docklands Development Corporation.
To the east, six further stations are planned - Canada Water, Canary Wharf,
North Greenwich, Canning Town, West Ham and Stratford - as part of the
Pounds 1.8bn project to rejuvenate the area by providing a fast link to
London's West End.
A journey along the route reveals that although funding has been approved
for the link, enthusiasm in Thames-side communities has been tempered by the
realisation that benefits will not emerge until well into the next century.
In Bermondsey Mr George Dunk, councillor for the Riverside ward which
includes the station site, says that beyond injecting confidence and
creating work for construction workers, the best that can be hoped is that
more tenants will exercise the right to buy and shopkeepers will extend
their leases.
But there is optimism that at the next two stations - Canada Water (the
interchange planned with the East London line) and Canary Wharf - the
Jubilee extension will fulfil its promise of rejuvenation.
That optimism is based on expansion plans for developments such as the
Surrey Quays shopping centre and the Greenland Dock residential development.
At Canada Water, the LDDC is preparing to release for development 20 acres
of land which had been held back pending the Jubilee line decision. At
Canary Wharf, Mirror Group Newspapers and London Underground have announced
plans to move in, taking total occupancy levels to 50 per cent.
Any rejuvenation will not take place overnight. Mr Roger Squire, assistant
chief executive at the LDDC, warns that the area still has a lot of empty
office property 'so the benefits will take some time to feed through'. In
residential property, 'significant price movements will not come about until
the line is almost open'.
According to chartered surveyors Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, there is still 5m sq
ft of vacant office space in the LDDC area, enough to accommodate 25,000
workers.
Mr Roger Parsons, partner at the surveyors' Docklands office, also warns
that the escalating costs of the project - up almost 80 per cent since 1989
 -could mean some stations might not be built.
North Greenwich, the stop after Canary Wharf, is in doubt, he says. British
Gas, which owns the site on the Blackwall peninsula, is still negotiating
with London Underground about the estimated Pounds 30m construction costs.
From Canning Town, Jubilee line trains will run on the surface next to
British Rail tracks. But one local employer, who asked not to be named, says
bringing Canning Town and West Ham within 20 minutes of the West End will
have little effect on the area. 'We really needed help 10 years ago. It
seems to me they are creating a commuter zone for the Docklands but I don't
see it helping business much.'
The view from West Ham station is a bleak one. Canada Tower, the showpiece
of Canary Wharf, is visible across acres of derelict land punctuated only by
electricity pylons and vacant industrial units.
Mr Parsons expects Stratford to develop as a business location for the
Docklands. 'Before the Jubilee announcement this was going to be another
Croydon, a satellite with cheap accommodation,' he says. 'The extension and
the revitalisation of Canary Wharf have pulled Docklands from the brink of
possible obscurity. But it will take a long time.'

Nearly half of 286 personnel officers surveyed by Personnel Magazine said
their companies had increased the use of temporary staff in the past 12
months, with only 14 per cent saying they had reduced it.
Meeting fluctuations in demand was the most common reason given, followed by
the argument that flexible working reduced labour costs.

The contracts between the companies which take over railways from British
Rail must be flexible but will need to be set in a legal framework, Mr John
Swift, the new rail regulator, said yesterday.
Mr Roger Salmon, the railways franchising director, has expressed a wish to
establish a 'no-fault' system of agreements, with companies regulating
dealings by commercial contracts rather than the law.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Talks begin on airways dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK and US governments yesterday started a new round of talks in London
to try to resolve their dispute over transatlantic air services, Paul Betts
writes.
The UK has already warned Washington it would limit US airline services to
London's Heathrow Airport if the Washington administration sought to curtail
the rights of British Airways in the US.
Mr Lawrence Nagin, an executive vice-president of United Airlines, one of
the big three US carriers, said that a trade war between the two countries
would ultimately hit the consumer hardest because of the risk of fewer
transatlantic services.
The US will be pressing the UK government to grant US carriers more access
into Heathrow airport. The UK is seeking an easing in US regulations on
foreign ownership of US carriers.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Schools face crackdown on teaching hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schools in England and Wales will have to publish details of the number of
hours spent teaching each day, after the first annual report of Ofsted, the
school inspection service, called for an urgent inquiry into the length of
the school day.
The Department for Education made clear that it was planning action on the
length of school days after a 20 per cent variation in the total time
schools spend teaching was revealed. Mr John Patten, education secretary,
said the variation was 'unacceptably wide'. He added: 'Parents must wonder
how one school can offer up to a day a week more teaching than another, and
what effect this has. I certainly do.'
The report said bullying was a problem in every school inspected, and found
'an urgent need for improvement of educational management and leadership,
especially in matching resources to priorities'.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, announced the plan to add more
information to the league tables published on schools each year.
Professor Stewart Sutherland, chief inspector of schools, said the
variation, from more than 25 hours tuition each week to less than 20 hours,
was equivalent to a whole year's extra teaching at some schools over five
years.
Teachers' unions reacted with alarm. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary
of the NASUWT union, said the report was an 'implicit suggestion that the
school day should be lengthened'. It would meet 'outright opposition from
teachers faced with increased workload and a possible pay freeze'.
The report found that in all schools most lessons were at least
satisfactory. However, 30 per cent of lessons for children between eight and
11 were unsatisfactory while only 15 per cent of classes for
post-16-year-olds were unsatisfactory.
Ofsted added that there was a 'stubborn percentage of unsatisfactory
teaching' and a 'small proportion' which was 'downright poor'.
Good teaching standards had a 'direct correlation' with successful academic
results, but there was evidence that poor teaching was concentrated in inner
cities.
Prof Sutherland said: 'Sadly, the incidence of such teaching is often
greater in schools serving pupils and parents in urban areas with high
levels of social and economic disadvantage. We cannot be satisfied until we
record improvements for all children, regardless of back-ground.'
Ofsted is also to start a full investigation of the sharp drop in popularity
of mathematics and science courses compared with arts subjects. Prof
Sutherland said: 'There is no doubt about the trend - the overall number of
students taking A-levels is increasing while the proportion taking science
and mathematics is declining.'
He said there was a growing trend for teachers to have to teach areas of
science and mathematics with which they were not familiar, but would not
speculate further on the reasons behind the trend.

FT  08 DEC 93 / MoD criticised for 'overpayments'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence is paying suppliers between Pounds 25m and Pounds
30m a year more than necessary by failing to follow its own guidelines for
inflation-adjusted contracts, a National Audit Office report says.
The public spending watchdog says arrangements to deal with the effect of
inflation on long-term defence contracts have 'not worked as intended'. It
finds that the ministry often departs from its own ground rules, laid out in
conjunction with the Treasury almost 20 years ago.
In one case - the procurement of EH101 helicopters for the Royal Navy - the
result is an estimated extra cost of Pounds 72m over 10 years. This is about
4.5 per cent of the value of the contract, awarded in 1991 to IBM of the US
as project manager. The helicopters are made jointly by Westland and the
Italian company Agusta.
The audit office says the question of variation of price arrangements arose
late in negotiations, when there was pressure to get a contract signed
quickly.
Under the guidelines at least 10 per cent of a contract should be
non-variable. In the case of the EH101 the figure agreed was only 1 per
cent. The average for large contracts examined by the audit office was 5.45
per cent.
The guidelines also require a deduction to be made for productivity
improvements, but this was not done in most of the cases examined.
In many cases, the audit office says in its report, the ministry accepted
'without discussion' contractors' proposals as to which indices should be
used to calculate inflation.
About Pounds 200m is paid out each year under variation of price
arrangements. The contracts involved account for about 20 per cent of the
ministry's Pounds 9bn annual procurement budget. The MoD said yesterday it
had accepted less stringent terms to gain better basic prices. But revised
guidance had been issued and new arrangements would be discussed.
Meanwhile, defence officials denied that shell fuses bought four years ago
were defective, even though they could not be used in rain, hail or snow.
The fuses, made by Fratelli Borletti, were being phased out.
Experts said that in rain there was a risk that a shell might explode 150m
from the gun. This did not pose a danger to soldiers since the fragments
would be projected forwards. 'It would dim their outlook, though,' they
added.
The RAF is to scrap advanced jet training at Chivenor in Devon and mothball
the base. The training will be based at RAF Valley on Anglesey in north
Wales. The government said 119 civilian and 779 service posts would be
affected.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another rise in the Central Statistical Office's shorter leading index of
economic activity points to a favourable outlook for the economy.
The index, which is supposed to indicate economic turning points in activity
about five months in advance, was buoyed by increases in share prices and
new-car registrations.
There has been a slow-down in the fall of the longer leading index,
reflecting increases in housebuilding starts in recent months. The
coincident index, which tracks the business cycle, has maintained steady
increases since the second quarter of last year.

<TEXT>
A divorced father who is being asked for extra money by the Child Support
Agency failed yesterday to overturn a 'clean break' divorce settlement under
which he gave up his share of the family home on the understanding that he
would not pay maintenance.
Mr Gary Crozier, of Gretna Green, Dumfriesshire, had asked the High Court to
set aside the divorce settlement and give him his share from the sale of the
home.
Mrs Justice Booth said the settlement contained provision for nominal
maintenance of 5p a year. This reflected the legal principle that the clean
break formula had never applied to the on-going responsibility of parents to
a child.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Moslem parliament attacks schools' record
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Moslems underperform in English and Welsh state schools, the self-styled
Moslem Parliament of Great Britain said yesterday.
Using the government's school performance tables for GCSE exams, published
last month, it said Moslem children were in schools which 'have some of the
worst results nationally and locally'.
The group said the government's decision to reduce the weight given to
ethnicity in the formula used to distribute grants to local education
authorities, announced last week, would diminish investment for schools in
Moslem areas.
It alleged discrimination against Moslems in the school system, and said the
figures had been hidden by 'the general myth that Asian children are doing
well in education'.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Clarke says public liked Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday said the Budget had provided
the government with a 'firm grip' on public spending and it had set Britain
back on the road to recovery.
Winding up the five-day Commons debate on the Budget Mr Clarke told MPs that
future generations would have paid a heavy price in increased taxes if he
had not tackled Britain's public-sector deficit.
'What has been clear is that the public outside . . . have responded
favourably to a Budget setting out frankly and candidly how we are going to
tackle the country's problems.
'We are making progress towards getting on top of the PSBR, which if it was
not tackled would lead to increased taxation for later generations as the
interest piled up, and short term pressure on interest rates.'
At the end of the debate a government motion to implement the Budget was
approved by 326 votes to 291, a majority of 35.
Earlier in the day Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
praised the principal aim of the Budget to reduce the deficit.
'Nothing would have been more calculated to throw away the competitive edge
we now enjoy than a failure to take the difficult decisions about the
deficit, and to take them now,' he said.
He also used his speech in the debate to announced initiatives to help
industry and small businesses. These included an increase from Pounds 14m to
Pounds 17m in start-up funding for Business Link outlets.
The outlets are designed to bring together most of the services provided by
training and enterprise councils, chambers of commerce, local authorities,
enterprise agencies and other private-sector organisations.
The first outlets have opened in Birmingham, Leicester and in Congleton in
Cheshire. Mr Heseltine said Tecs - which deliver government training schemes
in England and Wales - 'have a key strategic role in organising the
provision of business support services'.
Tecs' budgets for services to small businesses - most of which will be taken
into Business Link outlets - are to increase slightly to Pounds 33m.
Mr Heseltine also announced an environmental technology best-practice
programme, worth Pounds 16m.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said spending by Mr
Heseltine's department would fall about 12 per cent in real terms in the
next three years.
'Out of 18 spending departments, the DTI is 17th,' said Mr Cook.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Names still waiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Names on the worst Gooda Walker syndicates were still waiting to hear full
details of how the Lloyd's settlement would affect them, but were suspicious
of the sums being offered, Andrew Jack writes.
Mrs Valerie Baker, who with her husband has Pounds 2m outstanding in calls
from Lloyd's, said: 'All I can say is it is an admission on Lloyd's part
that they haven't been running the shop right. We haven't had any personal
details yet. But it would have to be a pretty high-level offer for us to
accept.'
Some Names had already heard the decision by their action groups to reject
the settlement and were resolving to support this view. Ms Fernanda Herford
said: 'I gather it's 'no'. I didn't expect much. It's business as usual,
except some of us are very depressed. Hope springs eternal, I suppose.'
Mr Norbert Mallet said: 'We are going to court and we are going to win, so
why accept a compromise?

FT  08 DEC 93 / Legal threats at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Names reject yesterday's offer, many of the agencies which have managed
their affairs at the market will face a spate of legal actions over the next
few years
First big case will start in April next year, involving 3,000 Names who were
members of Gooda Walker syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 299 between 1988 and
1990. Names allege negligent underwriting and seek damages of more than
Pounds 550m from 71 Lloyd's members' agencies.
In October Mr Justice Saville will hear a case brought by 1,650 Names who
were members of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847 between 1988 and 1989.
Feltrim Names also suing for negligent underwriting, targeting 60 agencies -
of which 59 are members' agencies - in effort to recover up to Pounds 600m
in losses.
Third large case could come to court early in 1995. Some 2,000 Names on
Merrett syndicate 418 are taking legal action against 130 members' agents,
the Merrett managing agency, the syndicate's auditors, Ernst &amp; Whinney, and
Mr Stephen Merrett, the syndicate's underwriter, over losses registered in
the 1985 year. The claim is estimated at about Pounds 350m.
Smaller case involving more than 320 Names on Pulbrook syndicate 334 in the
1985 year had been expected to come to court in December this year. The
Names face losses of at least Pounds 80m.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Hume sees threat to Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party has warned
against setting up a Northern Ireland select committee, saying it could
endanger the Northern Ireland talks process.
Mr John Hume delivered the warning in a letter to Sir Peter Emery, Tory
chairman of the Commons procedure committee. A decision by ministers to
press ahead with a select committee for the province would be seen as
reinforcing the government's commitment to its unionist majority.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, offered encouragement to
select committee supporters in the Commons just six days ago by
acknowledging - in response to a question from Mr Hume - that the idea could
have 'some value'.
Confirmation of Mr Hume's letter emerged as British and Irish officials
continued concerted efforts to bridge differences between London and Dublin
over their planned joint declaration aimed at securing peace in Northern
Ireland.
Officials are striving to narrow the gap between the two sides ahead of the
next scheduled meeting between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr
Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels on Friday or Saturday.
Questioned in the Dublin parliament yesterday, Mr Reynolds was upbeat about
the pace of progress while admitting that 'a number of important outstanding
issues' had still to be resolved.
In a fresh attempt to reassure unionists, the Irish premier declared for the
first time in the Dail that Dublin was prepared to make a written pledge to
hold a referendum on its territorial claim over Northern Ireland. Speaking
as Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist
party, warned he would 'never accept' any further dilution of the unionist
position, Mr Reynolds said Dublin was relying on Mr Major to keep unionists
informed about the peace process.
Mr Hume is understood to believe any discussions about a select committee
should involve the province's non-violent political parties. An agreement
reached elsewhere would amount to a private deal. Adria, the Ulster textile
company, is creating 400 jobs in two projects in the north-west of the
province.
Some 250 jobs will arise from the expansion of Adria's Campsie factory, near
Londonderry. The others will be at a new factory at Strabane.

FT  08 DEC 93 / BT warned over changes in rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, yesterday served
notice on British Telecommunications that the regulatory structure would not
be altered in its favour.
He warned BT that any video-on-demand service it tried to offer in
competition with entertainment services provided by cable TV companies had
to correspond to the 'limited nature' of existing regulatory approval.
Mr Cruickshank, making his first policy speech as director-general of Oftel
to the FT's international telecommunications conference, dismissed BT's
claims that it was held back by unfair regulation.
He said that, in spite of the 10-year ban imposed in 1991 on BT providing
entertainment services over its network, it could have bid for a
'significant number' of cable franchises and 'could have integrated them
with its local network'.
Indicating that he would not support any review of the essentials of the
current regime, Mr Cruickshank added: 'I defend the present carefully-framed
regulatory structure and hope we can move the debate away from the myth.'
Mr Cruickshank's remarks brought his first public clash with Mr Iain
Vallance, BT chairman. Mr Vallance condemned over-regulation and warned that
BT faced a 'utility trap' threatening its ability to compete
internationally.
He stressed the case for improvements to the competitive environment in the
UK, in particular the need for 'greater transparency on the relationship
between costs and charges'.
He said Oftel would publish plans in the new year for a phased introduction
of a new interconnection structure between BT and competitors. The phasing
is believed likely to take place over four years, and could involve the
introduction of tariffs for specific services required by competitors.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Contract breach awards queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies partly responsible for their own loss from a breach of contract
should have their damages reduced accordingly, the Law Commission, the
government's law reform body, said yesterday.
It called for a change in the law to allow courts to apportion damages for
breach of contract where both parties were at fault.
Groups that have pressed for reform include the 1989 Jack Committee on
Banking Services Law, the Auditors Study Team on Professional Liability and
the Auditing Practices Board, the commission said.
Such groups are concerned that under present law, where one party is in
breach of contract and the other is also to blame, the winner takes all.
Contract law contrasts with the law of negligence where contributory
negligence results in a reduction of damages.
The commission says the present law is fair where a defendant is subject to
a 'strict' contractual duty, such as the obligation on a shopkeeper to
supply goods of 'merchantable quality' and that therefore a particular
outcome is guaranteed, regardless of fault. But it says where a defendant
has agreed only to take reasonable care it is unfair to assume he has
undertaken to compensate the injured party where he has contributed to his
own loss.
It recommends a change in the law to enable courts to apportion damages for
breach of a contractual duty to take reasonable care, or exercise reasonable
skill, where the plaintiff has failed to take reasonable care of his
interests.
It accepts, however, that parties should still be able to contract to
apportion risk, and so be free to exclude the apportionment rule. This will
safeguard the ability of businesses to allocate risk with certainty, it
says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Roman Catholic man was shot dead on the doorstep of his east Belfast home
last night.
The man, in his late 30s, answered a knock at the door of his home and was
shot at close range by a lone gunman, the RUC said.
The attacker made off on foot through the predominantly protestant area. The
victim was taken to hospital but died soon after admission.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility although the police said it
bore the hallmarks of a loyalist sectarian attack.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Stress at work 'rising sharply'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stress at work is increasing sharply and should be recognised officially as
a health and safety issue, a report urged yesterday.
Professor Tom Cox of Nottingham University, who prepared the report for the
Health and Safety Executive, said the problem needed government recognition
if employers were to tackle it effectively.
The report, published ahead of HSE guidelines due out next year to help
employers manage stress at work, recommended further research into the
problem, along with training for employers. Recent Manchester University
research showed that 90m working days a year were being lost in the UK
through stress.
The recommendations come as growing numbers of employees are seeking
compensation from their companies for stress-related illnesses. Several test
cases are due before the courts. In one, a former City worker alleges that
her 10- to 15-hour day caused a mental breakdown. Another employee claims
stress through overwork led to a gynaecological disorder, while a production
manager says staff shortages led to illness through overwork.
According to one of Britain's leading stress counsellors, the problem is
growing more acute as companies emerge from recession with smaller
workforces and leaner managements.
Mr Alistair Anderson, managing director of Personal Performance Consultants
UK, said he had noticed a disturbing number of suicides involving work
pressures.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Most Names to get less than Pounds 100,000: Lossmakers
sceptical of offer from Lloyd's - 'Substantial majority' is needed for
acceptance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A Rubik's cube with a seventh side' was how Mr Peter Middleton, chief
executive of Lloyd's of London, described yesterday's settlement offer to
loss-making Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the insurance market.
Lloyd's is offering Pounds 900m to meet claims of more than Pounds 3bn from
17,000 Names organised in 38 action groups. But each Name will receive an
individual offer tailored to reflect chances of success of legal actions and
other factors.
Names on the worst performing syndicates could receive payments of up to 66p
in the pound, although the overwhelming majority of the 21,000 Names
benefiting from the deal stand to receive less than 40p in the pound.
Lloyd's said that more than 100 Names stood to receive between Pounds
500,000 and Pounds 750,000, while a further 40 Names could get between
Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 1m. The bulk of Names would receive less than
Pounds 100,000.
Underpinning the complex arithmetic are the conclusions of two working
parties set up by Lloyd's in the summer.
Sir Michael Kerr, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, headed a legal panel
which has examined the legal merits of the action group cases. Sir Jeremy
Morse, former chairman of Lloyds Bank, examined the financial resources
available for a deal. Sir Michael ranked the cases of Names on 30 syndicates
according to their chances of success, evaluating them as strong, medium,
weak and hopeless.
His assessment favours Names on syndicates participating in so-called
'spiral' or LMX reinsurance, where Lloyd's syndicates and companies
reinsured each other's high-level catastrophe exposures.
Most of the claims against agents by Names on catastrophe syndicates managed
by agencies such as Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Bromley, Rose Thomson Young and
Devonshire, are rated as 'strong' by the panel.
Sir Michael regarded the legal claims of Names on so-called long-tail
syndicates - which specialise in US liability business in which claims can
emerge many years after the inception of a policy - less favourably. One
exception is his assessment of one of the main claims against Merrett
syndicate 418/417, which for the 1983, 1984 and 1985 years are regarded as
'strong'.
Further loadings have been introduced reflecting the progress of legal
action, membership of action groups and Names' exposure to more than one
'spiral' syndicate.
Names who were plaintiffs on writs issued by eight syndicates - Feltrim
540/542 and 847; Gooda Walker (164, 290, 298, 299); Merrett (418/417); and
Pulbrook 334 (whose legal cases are most advanced) - stand to receive 20 per
cent more than would otherwise be offered.
Names who were action group members when claims were submitted to the Kerr
panel can get an extra 50 per cent if they agree to the deal.
Names who have multiple exposure to 'spiral' and stop loss syndicates
receive an extra 10 per cent for each spiral syndicate participation after
the first.
Lloyd's has introduced an overall ceiling so that no Name will receive more
than two-thirds of total losses on the relevant syndicates.
Although claims of Pounds 3.15bn were submitted by Names, the legal panel
ruled that only Pounds 2.67bn could be assessed as damages, had the cases
succeeded in court. After taking into account its weighting of the legal
prospects of each claim, the amount of damages expected falls to Pounds
1.58bn.
Sir Jeremy's panel identified errors and omissions insurers, which cover
agents against legal awards for negligence, as the biggest source of
potential funds for the settlement.
The exposure of E&amp;O insurers - most of which are Lloyd's syndicates - was
estimated at between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1,085m. No details about the
contributions of the E&amp;O insurers are contained in the offer document but
this is understood to amount to Pounds 400m.
Lloyd's agents, who are targeted in the actions, have net assets of Pounds
80m. Agents as a whole have agreed to pay up to Pounds 50m in 'voluntary
contributions'.
The Lloyd's central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet
obligations, will match these contributions with a payment of about Pounds
450m.
This amount is not likely to lead to any outflow of funds from Lloyd's,
since between Pounds 700m and Pounds 750m of the Pounds 1,100m in the fund
is already earmarked to pay claims.
It is expected that a payment of Pounds 450m will allow Lloyd's to reduce
these allocations accordingly.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Managers face tough task to persuade angry opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior management at the Lloyd's insurance market will be hard-pressed to
persuade Names to accept yesterday's settlement offer, judging by reaction
from the leaders of Names' action group leaders.
Copies of the 200-page offer document will reach 21,000 Names in the next
few days and they will have just more than six weeks to consider its
implications.
Lloyd's said yesterday that a 'substantial majority' of Names would need to
vote for the deal for it to go ahead. It is understood that this would need
acceptance by Names whose claims represent more than 70 per cent by value of
those considered in the offer.
Early indications are against this. Names on syndicates specialising in
liability business, which have been hit hard by claims from asbestosis and
pollution, get least out of the offer and were predictably negative.
About 4,000 Names on Merrett syndicate 418 have been offered only Pounds
44.1m against losses of nearly Pounds 170m - even though part of their case
against agents was adjudged in the offer document to have a strong chance in
court.
Mr John Mays, deputy chairman of the Merrett 418 action group, said: 'We may
well recommend they reject it.' He was particularly worried by the absence
of any cap on future claims still arising on the syndicate's 1985 accounts.
One prominent member of another long-tail syndicate - Pulbrook syndicate 334
 -which has been offered about Pounds 2.5m compensation for losses of about
Pounds 80m, said: 'They have irritated the long-tail groups by tilting the
settlement offer in favour of the spiral Names. I fear they've blown it.'
More worrying for Lloyd's is the tough response yesterday from both Mr
Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, and Mr Colin Hook,
chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, whose members have most to gain
from the deal.
Both men successfully persuaded Lloyd's to load the settlement in favour of
their action groups, and in statements yesterday refrained from outright
condemnation. Even so it appears that the final offer - between 30p and 40p
in the pound for most Gooda Names, for example - falls short of their
expectations.
Mr Deeny said: 'There has been an effort to mitigate the position of the
Gooda Names. Our solicitors are considering the offer but I doubt very much
whether we will be able to recommend it.'
Mr Deeny is critical of the form in which awards will be made. Lloyd's will
issue special credits, two months after the offer becomes unconditional,
which would be used to discharge debts to the central fund, or be paid into
balances for the Names to pass the 1993 solvency test this month.
The credits would also be used to offset payments already made to Names by
stop-loss underwriters.
Mr Deeny was one of five Names' representatives, including two alternate
members, who did not sign the report of the financial panel. Mr Hook, Mr
Christopher Stockwell, the chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations
Working Party, Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members,
and Sir Adam Ridley were the others.
Mr Hook said he was satisfied that the legal panel recognised that Feltrim
had a strong case in law. Like Mr Deeny, however, he said the potential
deterioration of the syndicates' results in future years was not considered.
The deal gave protection to errors and omissions insurers but 'will not
provide our members with a commensurate benefit'.
In the end much may depend on the results of general meetings of both groups
next month.
Because of the constitutions of both Feltrim and Gooda Walker, the results
of these could bind more than 5,000 of the worst-hit lossmaking Names to
either accept or reject the deal. The omens are not auspicious.

independent gas companies said yesterday.
The companies, including gas subsidiaries of some electricity supply
companies, said that the independent sector would capture about 5 per cent
of the small tariff market in each of the first four years after the end of
the British Gas monopoly.

Rover Group would not have been able to introduce widespread changes to

Mr Simpson, who was giving evidence to the Commons employment committee

FT  08 DEC 93 / Smithfield tenants fail in election
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tenants of the Smithfield meat market were defeated yesterday in elections
for the Corporation of London's general council.
In nine wards which held competitive elections they were out-voted, while a
further election was ordered for next year on procedural grounds in the
Bassishaw ward, where Smithfield tenants had appeared certain to win at
least two seats.
At the 'ward mote' last Friday, where candidates announced their intention
to stand for election, the Smithfield candidates for the Bassishaw ward were
deemed to have made multiple applications for different wards.
The corporation said that their withdrawals from other wards had not been
properly conducted.
The Smithfield tenants had run as part of a campaign against what they say
are unfairly high rents being charged by the corporation to pay for the
Pounds 60m refurbishment of the market required by new European Union
regulations.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Changing times for foreign coins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frustrated by francs or dismayed by dimes weighing you down after a holiday
or business trip? Travelex, the bureau de change group, believes the answer
lies with its new multi-currency coin exchange machines which have just gone
into operation at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, Alison Smith writes.
Travelex hopes to recycle the coins through its bureaux de change, but
expects that some will have to be 'physically repatriated'. The cost of
handling coins is reflected in the exchange rates offered at the machines.
Yesterday, for example, putting Dollars 10 in coins into the machine would
have produced Pounds 5, compared with the Pounds 6.25 Travelex would have
paid for a Dollars 10 bill. Two DM5 coins would have realised Pounds 2.96,
against Pounds 3.70 for a DM10 banknote.
The machine in Terminal 4 at Heathrow changes US and Australian dollars,
Dutch guilders and French francs, while the one at Gatwick South covers a
different mix of currencies, including pesetas and D-Marks.

FT  08 DEC 93 / British Coal accused of 'wrecking'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Conservative MP yesterday accused British Coal of 'deliberate wrecking
action' when it removed new equipment from the last pit in the Durham
coalfield, diminishing its chances sale to the private sector.
Mr Peter Atkinson, MP for Hexham, attacked the dismantling and removal of
shearing machinery and pit props from Wearmouth colliery ahead of its
official closure on Friday.
British Coal confirmed it was taking out equipment with a written down value
of Pounds 8.3m from Wearmouth, where it has spent Pounds 24m in the last
four years opening up new reserves, but insisted the items were required at
other pits.
It said it had undertaken to maintain the fabric of the colliery, which has
not yet been advertised, while the licensing and leasing process took place.
Mr Colin MacLeod, chairman and owner of Caledonian Mining, a contracting
company interested in acquiring the Sunderland pit, warned that the removal
of machinery 'could make it so costly we couldn't go in'.
Mr MacLeod said he wrote to British Coal last month on the day it announced
Wearmouth's closure saying his company was 'extremely interested' in the pit
but had received no response. British Coal should have talked to potential
customers before remov-ing machinery, he said.
'It's of most value if it can keep that mine open and keep men in jobs,' he
said.
His plans would mean employing between 600 and 700 at Wearmouth, he said.
Most of the 670 presently employed there will lose their jobs this month, in
an area where alternative work prospects are poor.
'Whatever they get from us for it, it will be worth it to the people who
originally paid for it - not British Coal but the taxpayer,' said Mr
MacLeod. He added that he understood that British Coal had 'yards full of
gear and pit tops full of supports'.
Wearmouth is the only one of 31 pits that were named for closure in October
1992 that Caledonian Mining wishes to acquire, although it has expressed
interest in British Coal's privatisa-tion.
Mr Atkinson suggested equipment removal might be an attempt by British Coal
managers who were interested in a management buy-out and wanted to prevent
private sector competition. British Coal rejected this, pointing out that 20
pits were being offered to the private sector at the moment.
Sunderland Labour MPs Mr Billy Etherington and Mr Chris Mullin are also
pressing British Coal to retain machinery at Wearmouth. Mining unions have
pledged support for a private takeover in the interests of saving jobs.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Names in no mood to accept offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Names on the worst Gooda Walker syndicates were still waiting to hear full
details of how the Lloyd's settlement would affect them, but were suspicious
of the sums being offered.
Mrs Valerie Baker, who with her husband has Pounds 2m outstanding in calls
from Lloyd's, said: 'All I can say is it is an admission on Lloyd's part
that they haven't been running the shop right. We haven't had any personal
details yet. But it would have to be a pretty high-level offer for us to
accept.'
Some Names had already heard the decision by their action groups to reject
the settlement and were resolving to support this view. Ms Fernanda Herford
said: 'I gather it's 'no'. I didn't expect much. It's business as usual,
except some of us are very depressed. Hope springs eternal, I suppose.'
Mr Norbert Mallet said: 'I don't feel this is reasonable. We were happy to
pay legitimate claims but there is no way we are going to pay illegitimate
claims. We are going to court and we are going to win, so why accept a
compromise?
'The fact that Lloyd's has put up an offer shows they are going to lose. Why
should we accept less than 100 per cent? It's just not on.'
Mr Hugh Taylor said: 'It doesn't seem very brilliant. It is most unlikely I
will accept. I consider I've been dealt with dishonestly and dishonourably
and I am entitled to an apology and some compensation for the stress I have
suffered. I could not have been worse treated by Lloyd's. My feeling is let
them all rot in hell.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo threatens to scale down tariff offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The danger of shrinkage in the Uruguay Round of global trade reform was
raised in Geneva yesterday as Japanese negotiators warned they might modify
their tariff-cutting offers.
Their move came as a US-European Union market access deal took shape in
Brussels.
Japanese negotiators are threatening to pull back from conditional
commitments to cut to zero all tariffs on non-ferrous metal imports,
following signals that the EU is calling for special treatment on aluminium.
Similarly, EU demands that tariffs on wood and paper products be phased out
over a 10-year period, rather than five years as previously discussed, have
triggered threats of back-tracking.
Japan is refusing to discuss opening up its market for leather products
unless the EU tables a 'satisfactory' offer to cut tariffs on electronic
products and semiconductors. South-east Asian governments are also seeking
better access to Europe's electronics market before offering to open any
further their financial services markets.
It was unclear last night how far the latest bilateral US-EU deal on cutting
electronics tariffs had gone.
The EU is understood to have offered to cut to zero tariffs on certain
semiconductor equipment, but cuts for semiconductors as a whole may leave
average tariffs of about 3 per cent. Large parts of the electronics sector -
in particular the consumer electronics area of keen interest to Japanese
exporters - may remain largely unaffected.
In the non-ferrous area, considerable momentum towards a global compromise
was reached at the recent Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in
Seattle. Japan and other Asian importers agreed to a US-Canadian proposal to
cut tariffs across the sector to between zero and 3 per cent. The proposal
was finely balanced, matching US concessions in zinc with Japanese tariff
cuts in copper. The deal was conditional on the EU making similar
concessions in its own aluminium sector.
However, fierce French defence of the interests of Pechiney's new aluminium
smelter in Dunkirk has tied EU negotiators' hands. The present
tariff-cutting offer leaves average duties on aluminium pellets at 6 per
cent, and average duties on finished aluminium products at 7.5 per cent.
Only duties on semi-processed aluminium products are currently on the table,
with modest cuts from 10.5 per cent to 7 per cent on offer.
Canada and Australia seek gains for their non-ferrous metal exporters as
part of the balance for cutting tariffs in their own sensitive areas.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It is a familiar Brussels tale. European support for a Gatt world trade
agreement will depend less upon grand political calculations but rather on
behind-the-scenes deals aimed at appeasing aggrieved parties, of whom the
most powerful remains France.
As foreign ministers yesterday debated the merits of the US-European Union
trade pact, now within an ace of completion, it became clear that at least
four or five member states sought 'compensation'. Thus Portugal is looking
for special aid to restructure its ailing textile industry; Greece wants
compensation for potential losses to its maritime shipping industry; Spain
is worried about Mediterranean fruit; and Ireland is concerned about its
farmers.
Paris is leading the pack, using all-or-nothing tactics.
As a veteran EU diplomat put it, with both distaste and admiration: 'The
French have realised they have squeezed as much as they can expect out of
the Americans, now they are looking to do the same with their European
partners.'
Late on Monday night, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, insisted that
France was still unsatisfied on agriculture; industrial tariffs,
particularly on textile imports to the US; films and broadcasting; and new
global trade rules.
First, Paris wants a guarantee from its EU partners that French farmers will
not suffer any more loss of production under the revised EU-US Blair House
accord than it has already agreed under the May 1992 reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy.
Second, France is pressing for tougher European trade weapons such as
anti-dumping measures to match American measures. This would include a
'market opening' instrument similar to US Section 301 legislation. 'They
want a nuclear balance,' said one German diplomat.
By far the most serious problem centres on agriculture. France's demands put
her at odds with her traditional ally, Germany. If French pressure
translates into lower prices to compensate for Blair House curbs on
production, this would allow its comparatively efficient cereal producers to
capture market share in Germany at the expense of German farmers.
French pressure for financial compensation is a potential EU budget-buster.
Several diplomats doubted yesterday whether spare cash existed within the
seven-year Delors II budget package, agreed last December at the Edinburgh
summit, mainly because a 'weasel' provision allowing 'appropriate steps' to
meet exchange rate turbulence had been exhausted.
Germany is in a weak position. Traditionally a supporter of budget
restraint, Bonn makes an exception with its farmers. Hence its insistence
that the so-called 'switchover' mechanism to protect German farmers from
D-Mark revaluations remains intact - a demand which has grown louder after
the collapse of the ERM last August and the decision to float all currencies
within a 15 per cent band.
In better times, Chancellor Helmut Kohl would have slipped into his familiar
role as the reluctant paymaster. But with a steep budget deficit and sliding
popularity, Mr Kohl no longer has the same margin of manoeuvre.
The assumption yesterday was that the internal wrangle would have to be
resolved at the European summit on Friday. The billion Ecu question is
whether Mr Kohl will cough up, once again, for his French ally.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: France opens up a second front - Paris is
trying to squeeze concessions from its EU partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France has now opened a second front in the Gatt negotiations by demanding
from its European Union partners compensation for concessions EU negotiators
have failed to wring from the US.
The question is whether it is prepared to go as close to the brink with its
partners as it has been with the US, and in the process risk scuppering the
whole Gatt deal.
France's demands for guarantees that its farmers will not have to take 'one
single extra hectare' out of production as a result of a Gatt deal, and its
insistence that Europe arm itself with 'the same instruments of commercial
defence' as the US may have come as a shock to some EU partners. But they
should not be a surprise, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said
yesterday.
'As far back as April,' when the Balladur government came into power, 'we
have been sending memos' to Brussels on the need to reinforce EU
anti-dumping and retaliatory powers and to ensure any Gatt farm deal
involved no greater 'set-aside' than the EU's existing reforms, he said.
Now, 'our partners have got the message' France is 'ready to give a Gatt
farm deal the green light only if there are simultaneous changes in the
common agricultural policy,' Mr Jean Puech, the agriculture minister said
yesterday.
Paris' appetite for brinkmanship seemed yesterday only to have been whetted
by what Mr Juppe admitted yesterday were very significant gains on
agriculture. Mr Juppe should, by virtue of being also secretary general of
the RPR Gaullist party, have a very good idea of what the Balladur
government needs to satisfy its backbenchers.
But he and other ministers almost seemed to relish the fact that for them
the negotiations were only just beginning. In the intra-EU negotiations to
come they can play a direct part, instead of being sidelined in talks with
the US by the European Union system which delegates the bargaining on
foreign trade to Brussels commissioners.
So, Mr Juppe blasted away at 'total US intransigence' on audiovisual
broadcasting and other issues still to be sorted out by Sir Leon Brittan,
the chief EU negotiator in Geneva, and gave the impression that his energies
in the next few days would be devoted to squeezing France's EU partners for
new money and measures.
But this could be a brink too far, one French farmers' leader suggested last
night. 'We should not get into the compensation game,' said Mr Pierre
Cormoreche, president of France's chambers of agriculture, 'because other
(EU) countries have their interests to defend'. He expressed doubt that the
EU farm budget would stand the strain, an issue not addressed by French
ministers yesterday.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Japanese premier 'ready' for deal on rice
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's prime minister indicated yesterday that his government was ready to
accept a compromise on opening its rice market to imports.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa said Japan, which benefited from the world's free trade
system, needed to bear a proportional burden. His comments increased the
tensions within his seven-party coalition, which includes the Social
Democratic party which depends heavily on the farming vote, which wants to
keep import restrictions.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDP, reaffirmed the party's opposition
to the partial lifting of the rice ban. Some hardliners within the party
have been threatening to leave the coalition if the import ban is lifted.
The SDP, the largest member of the coalition, will officially decide its
policy tomorrow, before the Japanese government's formal announcement on
Friday.
Mr Hosokawa's remarks yesterday were in response to a draft proposal by
Gatt's market access negotiators.
It allows a six-year grace period on tarification of rice imports, on
condition Japan allows minimum access of 4 to 8 per cent of domestic
consumption during the period.
Whether the special treatment will be continued after the moratorium period
is subject to negotiation a year before the period ends.
In spite of the outcry from farmers' associations, the business community,
which faces constant overseas pressure over Japan's mounting trade surplus,
applauded the decision to lift the symbolic trade barrier. Farmers and
students fought riot police in the South Korean capital yesterday as tens of
thousands protested against a government U-turn which would allow rice
imports, Reuter reports from Seoul.
Some protesters attacked police lines with sticks and iron bars while
shouting slogans against talks in Geneva between South Korean and US
officials which are expected to lead to liberalisation of the rice trade.

Cathay Pacific is to buy six long-haul Airbus A340-300 aircraft, costing
USDollars 800m, Louise Lucas writes in Hong Kong.
Cathay said the aircraft - which can carry 233 or 260 passengers - will
enable it to increase profits on traditionally less profitable long-haul
routes, such as those between Hong Kong and Amsterdam, Paris, Rome and
Zurich. The decision to buy Airbus, rather than Boeing, was based on product
suitability. The new aircraft will come on line in 1996-1997. Meanwhile,
Cathay is to lease four A340-200s.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: German-French telecoms tie-up is seen in
global strategy terms - A regulatory riddle for the European Commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The joint venture between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom unveiled
yesterday presents the European Commission with a regulatory conundrum.
The companies have already been talking informally to Brussels and will now
present formal proposals for a joint venture to the competition authorities.
Their hope is that they will receive clearance from the Commission before
the end of the first quarter of next year.
The companies believe the Ecu1bn partnership - to offer advanced telecoms
services to business customers - should be examined in the context of a
rapidly developing global market. They are also eager to stress that it
amounts to the best chance Europe has of gaining a strong strategic foothold
in that market.
By linking up, 'we are contributing to the pan-European fusion of cultures
and markets, and we are helping to create jobs in a fascinating industry and
to secure Europe's position within global industrial competition,' Mr Helmut
Ricke, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, said yesterday.
If the Commission accepts that the Franco-German alliance should be judged
against the largest telecoms companies in the world - particularly from the
US - then it is unlikely to block the deal on anti-trust grounds. Even
judged by more restrictive standards, the two companies claim only 10 per
cent of the European market for advanced services, although they admit the
figure is based on guesswork.
As Mr Marcel Roulet, France Telecom's chairman, said yesterday: 'We think
that the Brussels authorities are aware that it would be somewhat
paradoxical if their rules led them to block a partnership between large
European players, while approving partnerships between players from
different continents.'
First, however, the Commission will have to decide whether the Franco-German
deal falls under its jurisdiction. In September, the Commission decided it
could not examine the proposed joint venture between British Telecom and the
US operator, MCI, under its 1990 merger regulations - which allow for a
fast-track procedure lasting less than six months - because the deal was too
small. Instead, it has decided to look at the alliance under wider European
anti-trust rules, and that investigation is continuing.
BT is already concerned about its joint venture being confused in regulatory
terms with the Franco-German alliance. The British company argues that a
joint venture between two state-owned companies - which are simultaneously
resisting any acceleration of the European liberalisation process - cannot
be compared with its free-market joint venture.
However, the coincidence of the two inquiries would also allow the
Commission to develop its policy towards such mergers at a stroke. Deutsche
Telekom and France Telecom hope for a reasonably flexible interpretation of
the rules. They stressed yesterday that their alliance - at least at this
stage - covers only those areas which have already been opened to wider
European competition.
The alliance sends a mixed signal to telecoms ministers, who were meeting in
Brussels yesterday to discuss the ground rules for the liberalisation of the
European industry. The French and German governments have thrown their
weight behind the deal. But other ministers may oppose a strong new joint
venture, which would challenge the ability of their own state-owned telecoms
groups to compete on the liberalised market.
However, a flexible interpretation of European competition rules would chime
with the Commission's overall vision - contained in its White Paper on
growth, competitiveness and employment - of a new 'information society,'
serviced by strong telecoms and information technology companies.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Balladur sidesteps Uruguay Round trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, saw the Gatt negotiations as
'a trap between international isolation and a domestic political crisis' for
himself and France.
He brought the world trade talks to the brink of collapse to win an
agreement with the US, particularly on agriculture, which may yet provoke
the wrath of his backbenchers and the farm lobby. But Mr Balladur may be in
the process of wriggling out of his trap.
His ministers, however, were yesterday saying that France was still not
satisfied on several aspects of the Gatt negotiations.
Mr Balladur's moment of truth will not come until the French parliament
pronounces probably next week on what the talks in Brussels and Geneva
produce. The opposition parties - Socialists, Communists and National Front
 -were yesterday quick to denounce the tentative trade agreement.
But it is hard to believe that Mr Balladur will go before the National
Assembly without first squaring the ruling coalition parties.
In this task, he is getting a helping hand from President Francois
Mitterrand, a Socialist. Mr Mitterrand was last night consulting leaders
including Mr Balladur's fellow gaullist Mr Jacques Chirac, whose cultivation
of the farm vote in his bid for the presidency has worried the prime
minister. Mr Mitterrand is due to see farmers' leaders today before he and
Mr Balladur set off for the EU summit in Brussels on Friday.
In Brussels, the French leaders will drive home their country's demands that
the Gatt deal will not force French farmers to take any more land out of
production, or leave Europe without the same instruments of commercial
defence against dumping or unfair trade as the US has.
By throwing these intra-EU demands into Europe's negotiations with the US,
the French government has irritated its partners but also, in Paris' view,
widened the scope for trade-offs, allowing France to get compensation from
Brussels for concessions it could not wring from Washington.
But underlying all this has been the way that Mr Balladur has sought to use
his political weakness over Gatt as his strongest bargaining card. It is,
after all, conceivable that an unsatisfactory Gatt deal could topple him
from power.
In the agricultural area, Mr Balladur has at least staved off the sharpest
cuts in French subsidised farm exports until the later 1990s. This would
postpone any pain until after the 1995 presidential election, on which he
still has his options open.

FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Blank tapes row leaves Gatt negotiators
out of tune
</HEADLINE>

It is a mercy that the 50-minute flight from Brussels to Geneva is too short
to screen films. They would without doubt be American, and for bleary-eyed
US and European Union negotiators who yesterday headed for the headquarters
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after inconclusive all-night
negotiations, they would have rubbed salt in already deep wounds.
As officials briefed Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, and
other international trade negotiators, on why they remained at loggerheads
over bilateral trade reforms, the issue of US film-makers' rights in
Europe's audio-visual market appears to be at the heart of their outstanding
problems.
Before leaving for Geneva, Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, said:
'We can see the outlines of a truly historic agreement involving 110 nations
 .We were not, however, able to conclude agreement in the audio-visual
sector because the EU was unwilling to provide foreign companies fair access
to the revenues that are their due as owners of intellectual property
rights.'
The irony is that both Mr Kantor, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart,
arrived in Geneva with 99 per cent of an immensely ambitious market-opening
package already settled. Mr Kantor talked yesterday of a package that would
involve EU tariff cuts for US goods of 50 per cent, with zero-for-zero cuts
alone being worth over Dollars 5bn.
The EU has won similar cuts from the US. The agreement paves the way to a
global tariff-cutting deal that is expected to add more than Dollars 230bn a
year to trade by the year 2003. Why then has a dispute over copyright and
royalty payments to US performing artists - worth tens of millions of
dollars at most - put so much in jeopardy?
Inevitably, part of the answer lies in irrationality: US negotiators who
have bowed twice in the past 12 months to strident EU pressure to amend
Uruguay Round plans to liberalise farm trade - at immense political cost at
home - have focused on the audio-visual issue as one on which a stand must
be made. A powerful and noisy lobby at home, headed by Mr Jack Valenti,
president of the American Motion Pictures Association, has kept US
negotiators under pressure.
The sector is of immense importance to the US. Sales to Europe of films,
music and television programmes amounted to Dollars 3.6bn last year. Only
the aerospace sector earned more. In spite of an EU broadcasting directive
which is supposed to reserve at least half of broadcasting time to
European-made programmes, US productions accounted in 1991 for 81 per cent
of European cinema screenings, more than 70 per cent of box-office takings,
and 54 per cent of dramas and comedies on television.
Europeans - particularly the French - are demanding protection for their
audio-visual sector on cultural grounds. They have insisted this must
include future technologies, like satellite and cable television,
multimedia, and pay-for-view films, despite knowing that it will be
virtually impossible to police such protection.
While scoffing at such claims as protectionism in disguise, the US has bowed
to most EU demands. Mr Kantor said yesterday: 'We have fully respected the
cultural identity of Europe, and agreed to their cultural specificity
language.'
The residual dispute hinges on French and German levies on blank audio and
video tapes which are used to subsidise the arts locally, and provide funds
for local copyright holders. The US says American performers and producers
have a right to a share of these levies, since the tapes are largely used to
record US-made films or music.
The EU retorts that there is no obligation under the Gatt to treat foreign
and local performing artists equally. They also complain that since the US
has no such levy, there is no reciprocal opportunity to raise funds in the
US for European artists. There is no exact estimate of the sums involved,
but the tens of millions discussed pale into insignificance alongside the
billions at stake in the Uruguay Round.
Angry exchanges over this issue are also distracting attention from the
immense ground covered by US-EU negotiators in recent days in agreeing a
far-reaching tariff-cutting package. This is understood to include:
Tariffs on wood and paper products cut to zero.
'Very substantial' tariff cuts across the electronics sector, averaging 70
per cent, with some cuts to zero.
Tariffs on steel cut to zero.
Tariffs on some non-ferrous metals cut to zero.
Some 80-85 per cent of US tariff peaks cut on glass, ceramics and textiles.
The introduction of ocean shipping to Gatt disciplines.
Completing a procurement deal.
The package also agrees a new, more gentle, regime for reducing Europe's
subsidised food exports. This bows to French demands and allows EU farmers
to export in total an extra 8m tonnes of wheat over the coming six years. US
farm exporters will reap similar gains.

<TEXT>
Mr Shaul Eisenberg, the Israeli billionaire, has concluded a series of deals
to expand his investments in China following the normalisation of
Israeli-Chinese relations.
Many of the deals, involving the opening of Burger King fast-food
restaurants, expansion of oil refineries and construction of a highway, were
concluded during the recent visit to Israel by the governor of Jiangsu
province, Mr Wu Guanzheng. The governor was a guest of Mr Eisenberg.
Under the Burger King deal, signed this week in Tel Aviv between Mr
Eisenberg and Mr James Adamson, president of Burger King International, the
Israeli financier has won the franchise to open at least 10 restaurants in
China.
The first 500-seat restaurant will be in Beijing. Mr Eisenberg's
Panama-registered United Development Incorporated (UDI) will carry out the
project in co-operation with Chinese partners.
During the visit of Jiangsu's governor, Mr Eisenberg also signed agreements
to expand the province's oil refineries and construct a toll-highway from
Nanjing to Shanghai.
In addition, Mr Eisenberg is taking a stake in a new joint venture with
Italian and local partners to produce industrial sewing machines. UDI is
joining with Rimoldi, an Italian manufacturer, and Tianjin Tiangong, a local
Chinese company. At full capacity, the new venture will produce 25,000
sewing machines a year.
The majority stake will be held by the Chinese partner, while Rimoldi will
have 23 per cent and UDI about 18 per cent.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Bank of Japan chief urges more deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, called yesterday for
further deregulation of Japan's financial markets, to help Japanese banks
write off their non-performing loans.
Pointing to the sluggish economy, Mr Mieno noted that further bad debt
write-offs by the banks were necessary before the economy could pick up. A
key to Japan's economic recovery was to create an environment for banks to
write off their bad loans, thereby improving their balance sheets, he said.
In particular, it was worth considering whether the financial markets could
play a role by providing a means for banks to securitise their
non-performing loans, the central bank governor said. 'The many functions of
the financial markets, particularly the transfer of risk, played a major
part in the recovery of US corporations. We must examine if there is room to
use those functions in Japan's financial system.'
But in order to do so, Mr Mieno said, Japan's financial system, including
regulations, tax, and settlement and accounting procedures, would need to be
revamped. Under present rules, the securitisation of bad loans is highly
restricted, with no secondary market in Japan to trade such securities.
'Financial institutions should make their own best judgments' about how to
write off their bad loans, but it was the responsibility of the authorities
to 'remove all obstacles in their way, creating an environment that will
allow them to do so,' Mr Mieno added. His call for greater market
deregulation contrasts with the stance of Japan's Finance Ministry, which
has been cautious about loosening its reins on the country's financial
institutions.
In addition to returning the financial institutions' balance sheets to
health, Japanese companies still had to complete the adjustment of stocks
and their balance sheets after the excesses of asset inflation in the
late-1980s. 'Unless the economy goes through these adjustments, it cannot
proceed to the next stage.
'Our stance is to carefully watch over the situation,' Mr Mieno said.
Concerning prospects of another cut in the official discount rate, he
believed interest rates were already low enough to support capital
investment by Japanese corporations once such activity picked up.
His remarks came amid growing unhappiness with the government's handling of
the economy.
A survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's economic daily, found nearly
49 per cent of the 3,000 people polled were critical of the economic policy
of Prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa, against 44 per cent who viewed the
government's measures positively. Over half wanted economic measures to take
precedence, compared with 38 per cent who thought political reform more
important.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Democratic Alliance of Burma, a hard-pressed grouping of ethnic
fighters, political exiles and students which has been the focus of
opposition to the Rangoon regime, is willing to enter into peace talks to
end four decades of armed struggle against the military government, it said
yesterday.
Dr Em Marta, spokesman for the Karen insurgents and a member of the
alliance, said the DAB was willing to send a delegation to Rangoon to
prepare the ground for substantive talks. 'We can go to Rangoon to see what
they have to offer, to test their sincerity,' he declared.
The alliance has until now said it would engage only in comprehensive
round-table talks, outside Burma, after the release of all political
prisoners. The heroine of the democracy movement, Nobel Peace Prize winner
Aung San Suu Kyi, is now in her fifth year of house arrest in Rangoon.
The Karen rebels who dominate what is left of the alliance have found
themselves isolated because of Rangoon's policy of making ceasefire deals
with elements of the grouping.
The 3,000 Karen soldiers and the 2,000 fighters of the Karennis and Mon
ethnic insurgencies who remain are now vulnerable to the Burmese army's best
troops. But Dr Marta insisted Rangoon would have to negotiate with the DAB,
and not keep on trying to pick off opposition groups one by one.

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday Syria was ready
to renew peace talks after successful shuttle diplomacy by Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state.
The claim came as Syria said it had rejected an Israeli proposal to withdraw
in four phases from the occupied Golan Heights in return for immediate
peace.
Mr Christopher is expected to announce the resumption of Middle East peace
talks in Washington in January after a break of seven months when he returns
to Damascus tomorrow for a second round of talks with President Hafez
al-Assad.
In Bonn Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman,
renewed his demand that Israel stick to a deadline five days away for
starting to withdraw Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area
of Jericho.
Mr Arafat said the December 13 date was sacred and if it was not met 'it
would reflect negatively on the credibility of the peace process'. In Israel
officials reiterated that the deadline could not be met although some
symbolic gesture might be made.
A meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, is
one option being considered. Mr Arafat is due to meet Mr Peres in Spain
tomorrow.
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators remain deeply divided on a number of
economic and security issues. In Cairo, where talks are being held on
military and security issues the two sides have yet to agree the size of the
Jericho area, who will control border crossings and the number of Israeli
troops who will remain in Gaza-Jericho to protect Israeli settlers.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said however that the two sides would
exchange draft agreements today which would be subject to further
negotiations.
Some progress has been made in Paris, where the two sides are negotiating
future economic relations. Mr Yacob Tsur, Israeli agriculture minister, said
yesterday agreement had been reached on a phased entry of Palestinian
agricultural produce into Israel starting with 70,000 tonnes of vegetables
and 100m eggs in the first year.
Mr Tsur also said the Palestinians had agreed to prohibit import of produce
from third countries currently prohibited in Israel.
Officials also said the two sides had largely agreed on money and banking
for the Palestinian economy. Disagreement remains over an Israeli proposal
for a customs union with harmonisation of taxes and duties.
Meanwhile, Israeli settlers all across Israel demonstrated, blocked roads
and shouted anti-government slogans protesting against Monday's killing of
two Jewish settlers in an ambush by extremist Palestinians in Hebron.
Thousands took part in the funeral procession from Bnei Brak through
Jerusalem to Hebron.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Jewish settlers to fight on as 'vanguard soldiers': 'Peace
agreement is a recipe for civil war' - Fear and hatred in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cradling an infant, Mrs Orit Struck, a 33-year-old pregnant mother of six,
talks softly about the fears of Jewish settlers in Hebron, a hotbed of
zionist militancy and a flashpoint of current Arab-Jewish violence.
'Every time I take my children to school I have to try hard to smile at them
because I know that by noon I may not see them ever again,' she says the
morning after Palestinian gunmen ambushed and shot dead a settler and his
son in Hebron. 'That is the most awful thing for a mother.'
Of the Arabs, she says: 'We know they hate us and are our enemies. They tell
us openly as soon as the army leaves they will come and kill us all with
guns and knives. But the worse thing is that there are Jews in the
government standing behind them and giving them encouragement. We are
betrayed.'
So why does she stay in her small apartment complex, surrounded by soldiers,
gun-toting Israeli settlers, wire fences and watchtowers in an Arab town?
Like many orthodox Jews, Mrs Struck, who carries a gun, believes that God
gave the Jews all the land in the West Bank - which they call by the Old
Testament name of Judea and Samaria.
'The places in Judea and Samaria are the roots of Jewish life. It is like a
tree and here are the roots, especially Hebron. Here Abraham brought land
for his sons and King David started his royalty. We are like vanguard
soldiers of the Jewish people. To leave would be like deserting a soldier's
post. Most people, like me, are becoming more stubborn.'
Outside soldiers patrolled the deserted roads of the usually bustling Arab
market town enforcing a strict curfew after Monday's killings which, in
turn, came after Jewish settlers shot into crowds of Palestinians last week
and killed one.
At the scene of Monday's ambush a group of Jewish students erected a
memorial to the two dead settlers out of stones stained with dried blood.
Behind them lay an overturned Arab car and smouldering tyres set alight when
settlers rioted after the killings.
Since the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord was signed in September, the
120,000 Jewish settlers have been increasingly vocal against the agreement
which they fear, ultimately, will mean giving up their homes.
Violence on the settler side has been matched by Islamic fundamentalists who
are also opposed to peace, leaving at least 18 Israelis and 34 Palestinians
dead since September. Yesterday the fundamentalist Hamas movement claimed
responsibility for Monday's killings and said it was changing tactics from
attacking soldiers to attacking settlers.
The settlers, acting under the umbrella of the Yesha Council, have formed a
security organisation called Hashomer - an armed security force of settlers.
They have also threatened a nation-wide campaign of civil disobedience.
Some government ministers have branded Yesha Council 'a subversive
organisation' and the violence 'Jewish terrorism'. One warned that the
government might consider taking away the right of settlers to carry
weapons.
All of this has divided the country and raised the prospect of an upsurge in
conflict.
'We have always said the peace agreement is a recipe for civil war between
Jews and Palestinians,' said Mr Elyakim Ha'Etzni, a right-wing settler
leader. 'The whole country is going to be consumed by civil war and it will
end up with tens of thousands of victims, and hundreds of thousands of Arabs
will be evicted. This is now inevitable. It will be just like Sarajevo.'

President Hastings Banda resumed executive power in Malawi yesterday, in an
apparent move to restore order after an army crackdown on Malawi Young
Pioneers, the armed wing of the ruling Congress party, Nick Young writes
from Lilongwe.
Government and party premises were attacked during the crackdown. Opposition
leaders doubt Dr Banda's ability to govern after a brain operation and a
two-month convalescence, during which power passed to a Congress party
triumvirate.

The World Bank has declared Zaire in default after the central African
nation failed to pay Dollars 23.8m (Pounds 16m) in interest and payment due
on its outstanding loans, George Graham writes from Washington.
Zaire owes Dollars 84m to the World Bank and Dollars 1.24bn to the
International Development Association, the Bank's concessional loan
affiliate.
With President Mobutu Sese Seko clinging to power, Zaire is in political and
economic chaos. The World Bank suspended disbursements on loans to Zaire in
July.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Ivory Coast left an explosive legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent, and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, Africa's longest
serving leader, died yesterday at the age of 88. He was the only leader the
country had known since independence from France in 1960.
The speaker of parliament, Mr Henri Konan Bedie, subsequently announced that
he had become president, sparking a struggle for the succession with the
prime minister, Mr Alassane Ouattara.
Whether out of vanity or superstition, Mr Houphouet-Boigny had refused to
groom an heir. 'An African chief never names his successor,' he once said,
and the subject became taboo.
In the past few days a succession crisis had developed. Mr Konan Bedie's
constitutional claim to the presidency, as parliamentary speaker, was
strongly contested by supporters of the prime minister, and by opposition
leaders.
Ivorians had been expecting the death of the president, who was stricken by
prostate cancer and had not been seen in public after he flew home from
Europe in a hospital aircraft on November 19. He stayed in his palace in the
town of Yamoussoukro, his birthplace.
The succession row centred on Article 11 of the constitution, which states
that the parliamentary speaker takes over at the president's death, ruling
until the next elections. But Mr Ouattara's supporters have been campaigning
for round-table talks to agree an interim authority until elections.
Although Mr Konan Bedie, a career politician from the president's Baoule
tribe, has the strongest claim to the presidency, Mr Ouattara, a former
director of the International Monetary Fund, enjoys a more solid reputation.
Mr Ouattara is nominally in charge of a government that has drifted for most
of this year.
Under Mr Houphouet-Boigny, Ivory Coast became the world's leading cocoa
producer and third coffee exporter. But it was too dependent on fluctuating
commodity prices and recent years have seen unemployment, crime and
corruption soar.
Policies that could arrest the Ivory Coast's economic decline have not been
forthcoming. France, which has paid the country's annual Dollars 350m
(Pounds 250m) debt-servicing bill to the World Bank since 1992, is
threatening to withdraw its support at the end of the year. The country
cannot service its Dollars 17.3bn foreign debt by itself.
The collapse of commodity prices has impoverished the country. The World
Bank estimates per capita incomes have plunged by 25 per cent since 1987.
'It is a decline comparable only to the hardships suffered in the Soviet
Union,' says a World Bank economist, 'without safety nets or programmes for
the poor.'
In the minds of many Ivorians, the country's economic malaise became fused
with the president's declining health.
Ivorians fear there is no one of Houphouet-Boigny's stature to rein in
ethnic and social tensions which threaten West Africa's most stable regime.
'Houphouet's legacy is crumbling,' says Mr Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the
largest opposition party, the Front Populaire Ivoirien. 'The ruling party is
tearing itself apart in the leadership struggle; the government is bankrupt;
civil servants are on strike. Our task today is to rebuild this crumbling
edifice together.'
So far, Mr Gbagbo's message has fallen on deaf ears. Racist overtones have
crept into the fray. Newspapers backing Mr Konan Bedie denounce Mr Ouattara
as a 'foreigner' because he was educated in Burkina Faso and the US.
Newspapers behind the prime minister attack the Konan Bedie camp as
'fascists'.
Underlying the concerns of many diplomats is the fear that if the
politicians cannot agree among themselves, the military will take over.
Mr Konan Bedie, 59, enjoys the backing of France, and the US, where he
served as a young ambassador after independence. His only career setback was
in 1977 when he was removed from overall charge of the Ivorian economy and
sent into exile as an adviser to the World Bank in Washington.
At the time, Mr Konan Bedie had presided for 11 years over an economy that
enjoyed steady growth. Mr Houphouet-Boigny sacked him and other ministers
after financial scandals. But in 1980 he was back, elected as parliamentary
speaker.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
White rule ended formally in South Africa yesterday when a multi-racial
Transitional Executive Council took office in Cape Town, in a ceremony
marking the end of decades of anti-apartheid struggle.
Its first substantive act was to approve a government application to the
International Monetary Fund for a loan of Dollars 850m (Pounds 570.4m) from
its compensatory and contingency financing facility, to counteract
balance-of-payments problems caused by last year's drought. It was the first
time Pretoria had sought the sanction of black South Africans for its
actions, and represents the first concrete step toward black rule.
'We have done it. We have achieved the seemingly impossible. Now for the
miracle of a completely free and fair election,' Mr Joe Slovo, Communist
party chairman and a former guerrilla leader who was for years Pretoria's
most hated adversary, told the first meeting of the TEC.
The ceremony, curiously muted, took place in the chamber of the Good Hope
building, in the shadow of Table Mountain. It was marred by the absence of
seven of the the 26 parties which originally took part in multi-party talks
on a new constitution.
Chief among these were the Inkatha Freedom party and the white-supremacist
Conservative party, whose decision to boycott the TEC, and possibly next
year's elections, threatens transition to democracy.
On Monday night, talks between the right-wing parties, known as the Freedom
Alliance, the African National Congress and the government broke down after
the ANC issued an ultimatum: the Freedom Alliance must agree to take part in
the TEC and other transitional bodies, and in the elections, before further
talks can take place on constitutional amendments to meet the alliance's
demands for stronger federal powers for regions.
The government has released a proposed amendment on regional powers, making
cosmetic changes to the constitution agreed last month. In a symbolic act of
protest at the installation of the TEC, about 30 armed white rightists
occupied Fort Schanskop outside Pretoria. The government and the ANC
continued to dispute the actual extent of the TEC's powers, with Mr Cyril
Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator, urging delegates to ensure it is not a 'toy
telephone'.

President Hastings Banda resumed executive power in Malawi yesterday, in an
apparent move to restore order after an army crackdown on Malawi Young
Pioneers, the armed wing of the ruling Congress party.
Government and party premises were attacked during the crackdown, believed
to have been instigated by middle-ranking army officers, in which about 30
people died. Opposition leaders doubt Dr Banda's ability to govern after a
brain operation and a two-month convalescence, during which power passed to
a Congress party triumvirate.
An opposition-dominated National Consultative Council has urged the
triumvirate's resignation and the sacking of Maj Gen Isaac Yohane, army
chief of staff. Dr Banda's return meets these demands halfway, but the
opposition wants an interim president appointed, pending elections.

FT  08 DEC 93 / A chief who postponed the day of reckoning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While most leaders are judged by their achievements, a cruel twist of fate
granted Felix Houphouet-Boigny such exceptional longevity that he was forced
to live through the decline of his greatest creation: the Ivory Coast.
The loss of 'le Vieux', the father of the nation, has given Ivorians the
chance of a fresh start 33 years to the day after independence from France.
They must now decide who is to succeed him and how - a question
Houphouet-Boigny refused to discuss during his lifetime - and confront the
economic and social malaise ushered by the collapse of cocoa and coffee
prices in the early 1980s.
As Houphouet-Boigny advanced in years, his pre-occupation with eternity
became more pressing than the day-to-day running of his country.
Like the pious monarchs of medieval Europe, Houphouet-Boigny paid lavishly
for a place in heaven. He often boasted that the Basilica of Our Lady of
Peace in Yamoussoukro, his Dollars 150m gift to the Vatican, was financed
from his personal fortune. The Basilica in the jungle, only a fraction
smaller than St Peter's, stands as a testament to his devout Catholicism -
and the delusions of grandeur common to dictators.
Born before the French took possession of his native village, Felix
Houphouet, a doctor trained in Dakar, made his first impression on the
colonial administration of the 1930s by campaigning for higher cocoa prices
for African farmers.
He added Boigny ('the ram' or 'irresistible force') to his surname after
being elected to the French constituent assembly in 1946, where he promoted
a law which abolished forced labour in France's African colonies. He went on
to serve six terms of office as a minister in the governments of two French
republics.
He did not fight for the Ivory Coast's independence. Rather, it was his way
of escaping plans for a Federation of West Africa advocated by fellow
Africans like Leopold Senghor of Senegal and Ahmed Sekou Toure of Guinea. He
was the odd-man-out among Africa's emerging leaders in many respects. Ideals
of pan-Africanism filled him with profound scepticism. He favoured close
ties with France, and a capitalist model of development. Africa, he was
quoted as saying, 'must be an extension of Europe'.
At the first summit of the Organisation of African Unity 30 years ago, he
was the lone voice opposed to sanctions against South Africa.
With French investment and thousands of French advisers in government,
however, Houphouet-Boigny's Ivory Coast came to be seen as a model
post-colonial state. He managed to combine a polished international
reputation and the outlook of an African chief.
Until 1990, the Ivory Coast was a one-party state, but a benevolent one.
Political opponents were occasionally locked up. More often, they were
co-opted into government with generous offers of ministerial posts. There
was no death penalty during his rule, and the Ivory Coast enjoyed a better
human rights record than most post-independence African states.
Above all, there was stability.
Every five years Houphouet-Boigny was re-elected, unopposed, to the
presidency with 100 per cent of the vote. He created an economy based on
cocoa and coffee, and borrowed heavily against the commodity boom of the
1970s to transform Abidjan into a showcase of African development. The Ivory
Coast was, for a while, the richest country in Francophone Africa.
Then the world price for cocoa started to fall, attempts to protect Ivorian
growers with guaranteed prices ran up huge budget deficits, and the nation
slid suddenly towards hunger and crime. When social unrest forced the advent
of multi-party democracy in 1990, Houphouet-Boigny conceded 18 per cent of
the vote to his rival, Laurent Gbagbo, in a contest marred by fraud.
By then, Houphouet-Boigny was well into his 80s and spending more and more
time convalescing from various ailments in Europe. The fact that there were
no coup attempts during his prolonged absences was a tribute to his
unquestioned authority.
His greatest mistake was to postpone the inevitable day of reckoning, when
the Ivory Coast would have to learn to live without him. The succession
became a taboo subject.
The animist traditions of his Baoule tribe, he once told visiting choir
boys, say that if you die a chief, you will remain a chief in the after
life. Die a servant, and you will forever be a servant. Houphouet-Boigny,
who retained the services of a witch-doctor as well as the top cancer
specialists of Switzerland, made sure he would die a chief.

FT  08 DEC 93 / US admits to over 200 secret nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US admitted yesterday it had concealed more than 200 nuclear tests since
1945 for fear of giving information to the Soviet Union.
Mrs Hazel O'Leary, the energy secretary, said yesterday the US had conducted
925 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1990, including 204 previously
undisclosed.
Mrs O'Leary said the announcement was 'a foot in the tub' for the energy
department's plan to release far more information about its activities and
restore public trust in the agency for the important debate about where and
how to store nuclear waste.
'We were shrouded and clouded in an atmosphere of secrecy. And I would even
take a step further - I would call it repression,' Mrs O'Leary said
yesterday.
Among the information emerging yesterday on the nuclear programme, Mrs
O'Leary said the US had used 98 tons of plutonium in weapons production
between 1945 and 1988, and that plutonium inventories at US nuclear weapons
production sites now totalled 33.5 tons.
'This informs everyone as we begin to grapple with the problem in a very
public way of the ultimate disposition of plutonium in the United States,'
Mrs O'Leary said.
The energy department also declassified much of its information surrounding
inertial confinement fusion research, as well as data on mercury releases at
the Oakridge plant in Tennessee.
Mrs O'Leary said the department was reviewing 32m pages for possible
release. The secrecy dates from the Manhattan Project, during which
scientists built the atom bomb that devastated the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War Two.
Mr Christopher Paine, a nuclear weapons expert at the private Natural
Resources Defence Council, said the number of previously secret weapons
tests was larger than had been estimated by specialists.
The government said 36 of the secret tests accidentally sent small
quantities of radioactive gas into the atmosphere, but there was 'no lasting
environmental impact, even in the immediate areas of the tests'.
About 1,600 pounds (725 kg) of radioactive plutonium missing from the Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado has been found buried at a federal
site in eastern Idaho, a Seattle newspaper reported, Reuter adds from
Seattle.
The Department of Energy acknowledged 'a discrepancy in records' accounting
for the missing plutonium, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said.
Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus said he is 'gravely concerned' about the
plutonium, buried over several acres at the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory.
The buried plutonium is in particles, on contaminated tools and clothing and
in sludge form, the newspaper said.
Department of Energy officials in Washington say that despite the accounting
mistake there was never any danger that the plutonium could have found its
way into the wrong hands.

<TEXT>
The US is to change its military planning, equipment and intelligence to
deal with the likelihood that, even after the demise of the Warsaw Pact, its
future enemies are likely to possess some form of chemical, biological or
nuclear weapon.
Mr Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, said new measures were needed
because 'a policy of prevention through denial won't be enough to cope with
the potential of tomorrow's proliferators'.
The military services have been asked to examine their equipment programmes
and shift money toward better ways of tracking mobile missile launchers,
improving bomb penetration to attack buried weapons sites and developing
detectors and suits to guard against chemical or biological attack. Theatre
missile defence systems will also be a priority.
These new counter-proliferation measures could cost hundreds of millions of
dollars, and a senior defence official said budget realities meant that
money would have to come from other defence programmes.
At the same time, US intelligence efforts will be shifted to gather more
information that the armed forces might need to help protect themselves
against weapons of mass destruction in future regional wars. The number of
military personnel in the Central Intelligence Agency's non-proliferation
centre will be tripled.
While US forces have always been prepared for a Warsaw Pact enemy in Europe
who possessed both nuclear and chemical weapons, military planning for
smaller regional conflicts has largely ignored such weapons of mass
destruction.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Brazil plans to bring in a new currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil yesterday announced a package of measures, including eventual
introduction of a new currency, to tackle the country's soaring inflation
rate of about 2,000 per cent a year.
The package, the seventh stabilisation attempt since 1986, will be
introduced gradually and will probably not take full effect until after the
government's term runs out next year.
It won cautious backing from the government's coalition partners and
economists because the measures first tackle Brazil's budget deficit, seen
as the main cause of inflation, and do not include 'shock' measures like
price freezes which have failed in the past, even if initially successful.
But several of the measures still need approval from Congress, which has
been paralysed by a corruption scandal tainting many of its members.
Proposed cuts in transfers to states and municipalities will also antagonise
Brazil's powerful state governors.
The government admits approval of the package may be difficult but hopes
that by explaining the measures in advance the country will realise the
severity of the problems.
It fears that, without the package, inflation will accelerate ahead of next
year's presidential and congressional elections. 'Economic policy will then
have to be either highly recessionary and politically unsustainable, or you
will have hyperinflation,' according to Mr Winston Fritsch, economic policy
secretary.
The first stage of the package, announced in general terms last week, is
built into next year's budget and calls for spending cuts and
revenue-raising measures to wipe out a projected deficit of Dollars 22.2bn.
The cuts include a set-aside of 15 per cent of the transfers made from the
central government to states and municipalities, to save Dollars 5.6bn.
There is also a 5 per cent increase in all federal taxes, to take the top
income tax rate from 25 per cent to 26.25 per cent, to raise Dollars 3.7bn.
Congress has to approve the budget and several constitutional amendments to
cover areas such as the 15 per cent set-aside, as well as longer-term
measures to solve a deficit in the social security system.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, also announced he would
support a number of measures designed to 'modernise the economy'. These
included the ending of the state monopoly on telecommunications and the
cancellation of a ban on the involvement of foreign controlled companies in
mineral extraction.
These areas are politically sensitive, and can only be approved through a
constitutional revision which is under way. Mr Cardoso was less specific
about the even more sensitive monopoly enjoyed by state oil company
Petrobras.
If the first stage of the package is approved, a new index to measure
inflation daily will be introduced. Almost all government revenues and many
private sector prices are at present adjusted in line with past inflation
measures, which often adds to inflationary expectations.
The new index could eventually be linked to the US dollar or a basket of
currencies and adjusted daily, as happens with the central bank adjusting
the exchange rate. The index would then become a new currency unit, backed
by Brazil's foreign currency reserves of over Dollars 20bn and the central
bank would be given more autonomy over monetary emission.
The new index, called the Unidade Real de Valor or unit of real value, is
partly designed to erase inflationary expectations which have dogged
previous currencies.
By shortening the period of price indexation and making index-linked
contracts forward-looking, past inflation would no longer contaminate the
new currency, the government hopes.

FT  08 DEC 93 / End of US coal strike in sight: Tentative agreement to be
put to vote next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most bitter labour disputes in recent US history appeared to have
been resolved last night as coal industry management and unions announced
that they had tentatively agreed a formula for ending a seven-month-old coal
strike.
The agreement, details of which have not been released, will be put to a
vote among union members on December 14.
If they vote to accept, their decision will end a strike that has involved
17,700 workers across seven coal-producing states and had hit about 10 per
cent of US coal production.
A resolution of the dispute will be particularly welcome to Hanson, the UK
industrial conglomerate which owns Peabody Coal, the biggest US coal company
involved in the dispute. The strike had been costing Peabody about Pounds 1m
a day and was a significant factor in the profits downturn reported by
Hanson last week.
The strike began after a labour contract between the United Mine Workers of
America and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association expired in May. A key
issue in the dispute over the renewal was the coal industry's insistence on
its right to set up non-union subsidiaries.
The union sought assurances that its members would have rights to jobs at
these non-union operations when the mines they were currently working at
were closed. Without that assurance, it said, its memebers would be 'mining
themselves out of a job.'
The closure threat was exacerbated because most of the affected mines
produce high-sulphur coal, a commodity already under pressure because of the
environmental pressures created by the US Clean Air Act.
The coal operators had responded to the union demands by proposing a
complicated formula for awarding some new jobs to union workers and some to
non-union labour.
Mr Richard Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers of America, last
night refused to give details of the agreement before it had been presented
to his members, but said the union had won a contract that guaranteed better
wages and pensions for miners while protecting their health care and working
conditions.
In a statement confirming that the two sides reached a tentative agreement,
the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association said yesterday its member
companies planned to return to normal working conditions as soon as
possible.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Pentagon to plan for new foes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US is to change its military planning, equipment and intelligence to
deal with the likelihood that, even after the demise of the Warsaw Pact, its
future enemies are likely to possess some form of chemical, biological or
nuclear weapon.
Mr Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, said new measures were needed
because 'a policy of prevention through denial won't be enough to cope with
the potential of tomorrow's proliferators'.
The military services have been asked to examine their equipment programmes
and shift money toward better ways of tracking mobile missile launchers,
improving bomb penetration to attack buried weapons sites and developing
detectors and suits to guard against chemical or biological attack. Theatre
missile defence systems will also be a priority.
These new counter-proliferation measures could cost hundreds of millions of
dollars, and a senior defence official said budget realities meant that
money would have to come from other defence programmes.
At the same time, US intelligence efforts will be shifted to gather more
information that the armed forces might need to help protect themselves
against weapons of mass destruction in future regional wars. The number of
military personnel in the Central Intelligence Agency's non-proliferation
centre will be tripled.
While US forces have always been prepared for a Warsaw Pact enemy in Europe
who possessed both nuclear and chemical weapons, military planning for
smaller regional conflicts has largely ignored such weapons of mass
destruction.
But Pentagon officials say that Iraq possessed chemical weapons, even if it
did not use them against the US and its allies in Desert Storm, and that
virtually every other country that might be a likely enemy in the near
future is at least dabbling in such programmes.
A senior defence official said yesterday:'They are one of the few things
that could stand in the way of the successful application of our
conventional military force.'
The US preference, he said, was not to respond to another country's weapons
of mass destruction by using its own special weapons.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Latin America incomes 'need restoring'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two out of every five Latin American city-dwellers are poor, while three in
five of the rural population live in poverty, according to a UN study
published recently, David Pilling writes from Santiago.
Throughout the 1980s income distribution worsened significantly as countries
adjusted to the effects of the debt crisis, according to the Social Panorama
report produced by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (Cepal).
'This did not only affect homes on low incomes, deepening their poverty, but
also hit the middle classes who lost out relatively in terms of income
distribution.' The task of restoring middle class living standards is 'more
difficult and lengthy' than that of eradicating extreme poverty, according
to Cepal, since it requires much greater resources.
In the short term, Cepal says, governments need to tackle three areas:
restoring salaries in the formal sector to pre-1980s levels, raising
productivity and conditions in the informal sector and strengthening
inadequate social security and pension provisions.
'By different means and with varying intensity, Latin American governments
have made advances on all three fronts, although much remains to be done,'
the report says.
In the medium term, governments must develop 'human resources' through
fairer access to education, tackling youth unemployment and expanding
resources in rural areas.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A clearer European identity in defence policy and a European economic
recovery would do much to ease strains in relationships with the US, Spain's
premier Felipe Gonzalez said yesterday.
Speaking after a White House session with President Bill Clinton on Monday,
he identified the Nato summit in Brussels next month and the extra steps to
European monetary union due to take effect on January 1 as important markers
in this process.
'We are still unsure if co-ordinated policies can lower European interest
rates,' he said. 'But lowering them, together with a Gatt agreement, is of
most interest to the US because a European economic recovery is in the
American interest.'
Mr Gonzalez thought Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, had
'exaggerated' last week in warning of the deleterious effects on Nato of a
failure to reach a Gatt agreement. But he conceded that it was proving
difficult to define policies to deal with what he called 'the new world
disorder'.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Chile finds growth fights poverty: Politicians put poor on
top of the agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From La Pintana, a desperately poor municipality in south Santiago, the
Chilean economic miracle seems worlds away. Most of La Pintana's
inhabitants, many forcibly relocated from more prosperous neighbourhoods
during the military regime, live in rows of cramped, squalid government
housing, often looking out on unlit, unpaved streets plagued with crime.
La Pintana's 170,000 inhabitants have no hospital and only one secondary
school. More than half live below the poverty line. According to the mayor,
Mr Jaime Pavez, residents are four times less likely to have regular work
than their fellow Chileans. They are nearly 200 times less likely to own a
telephone.
In spite of a decade of exceptional national growth, a third of Chileans
still find themselves below the poverty threshold, while nearly one in 10
lives in extreme poverty.
Huge discrepancies between rich and poor, long existent in Chile, are
becoming more obvious in a country whose rapid growth has delivered the
trappings of a consumerist, western lifestyle to large sections of the
population. So much so that both left and right-wing candidates in the
presidential election this weekend have put the issue of Chile's poor at the
top of their agenda.
Mr Eduardo Frei, the Concertacion coalition candidate widely expected to win
the presidency, has pledged to eradicate poverty within six years. Although
there is much to be done, Mr Frei says, the centre-left coalition has made
considerable inroads during its four-year term. According to official
figures, by November 1992 the percentage of people living in poverty had
shrunk to 32.7 from 40.1 two years earlier and 44.4 in 1987.
Given current growth rates, that figure should drop further to about 29 per
cent by next March, according to Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister.
'Essentially, in 1987 you had 5.5m living below the poverty line and by the
end of this administration it will be 3.8m. I think that's pretty
impressive.'
Mr Foxley also cites data showing that people in abject poverty - defined as
those unable to afford basic food requirements - fell to 9 per cent in 1990
from 13.8 per cent two years earlier, and 16.8 per cent in 1987.
Such progress, Mr Foxley says, has been the result of economic expansion
(which has averaged 6.3 per cent over four years), the rapid creation of
jobs, as well as specific policies to target Chile's poorest. Since 1990,
the government has raised the minimum wage by '30 per cent in real terms',
while family allowances have seen a 'big expansion'.
Mr Gert Rosenthal, executive secretary of the UN's Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean, agrees that there have been significant
improvements. 'The recuperation that you are seeing now in part reflects the
fact that, when this economy grows, you can pull people out of poverty in a
relatively short time,' he says.
'In other countries you can pour a lot of money in, but you are unlikely to
see results for a generation. The type of poverty you have here is
qualitatively different from that found, for example, in Peru or Bolivia.
The levels of education, infant mortality, health and so forth are quite
different.
'In Chile the workforce is sufficiently skilled to take up opportunities as
they arise. They are trainable. In many other Latin American countries,
there comes a point where this is not true.' The creation of jobs is thus
the over-riding factor, he says.
Official figures show unemployment continuing to fall sharply. The number of
jobless is 4.5 per cent, against 6.5 per cent in 1990 and 20 per cent in
1982. Although some observers question the accuracy of government jobs
statistics, few disagree with Mr Rosenthal's belief that unemployment has
'clearly come down terrifically', nor with his assessment that wages at the
lower end of the scale have risen markedly.
According to Prealc, the world employment programme, Chile has bucked the
regional trend by creating not only more, but 'better quality' jobs. Since
1985, the proportion of Chileans with low-paid, unstable work has steadily
declined. Only 50 per cent of Chileans are self-employed or work for small
businesses against 56 per cent in Mexico and 60 per cent in Colombia.
'Real salaries in Chile have shown a sustained recuperation since 1988,'
Prealc's report says. 'Despite this, minimum wages are still below those of
1980.' The group estimates real minimum wages at 83.4 per cent of 1980
levels, up from 63.4 per cent in 1985.
Mr Rosenthal says the government has struck the right balance between
specific measures aimed at tackling poverty and policies intended to
stimulate economic growth and job creation generally. 'If we were asked to
grade the government in this area we would give them high marks. They seem
to have got it about right.'
From La Pintana, it is less easy to be sanguine. Mr Pavez feels the
government has not done enough to help 'marginalised communities'. He is
particularly aggrieved at the allocation of local taxes which, he says,
favours wealthier municipalities.
'For example, in Las Condes (one of Santiago's richest districts) you have
well-equipped public health facilities even though most people go to private
clinics. Here, where there is much greater need, we don't even have a
hospital.'
Government housing too, he says, often fails to meet basic standards. He
recently refused to attend a ceremony in his municipality intended to
welcome residents to their new homes. 'Some houses didn't even have floors
or staircases,' he says. 'I didn't go because I couldn't say 'welcome' - it
would have been false.'
Mr Pavez says districts such as La Pintana need what he calls
'discriminatory decentralisation', the channeling of funds from wealthier
districts to poorer ones.
In the absence of the necessary resources, he says, it will prove almost
impossible to 'cut the vicious cycle of poverty. Without this we won't be
able to incorporate our people into the world outside - the world of the
Chilean miracle.'

FT  08 DEC 93 / Elections in Russia: Inflation fall is boost for Yeltsin men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government yesterday announced a significant fall in the
inflation rate, giving a boost to Russia's Choice, the electoral alliance
set up by radical ministers, in the run-up to Sunday's parliamentary
elections.
Inflation, the main gauge of success of unpopular financial austerity
measures, was reported to be down to 11.3 per cent in November from 20 per
cent in October. Mr Sergei Vasiliev, head of the government's economic
reform centre, said it was a triumph for a much-criticised tightening of
fiscal and monetary policy over the past six months.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, who says his campaigning for
Russia's Choice consists of keeping a close watch on the country's financial
health, promised that 1994 would be 'a year of investment and
restructuring'.
In the charged week before the elections, any economic developments are
being exploited to the full by Russian politicians.
By the same token, the deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, who is
responsible for foreign economic relations but running for a different
party, confirmed that President Boris Yeltsin would fly to Brussels today to
sign a political declaration with European Union leaders. The political
declaration, which puts Russia on the same footing as the US and Japan as a
political partner for the EU, also sets out the principles of a more
concrete partnership agreement to be signed next year.
Denying that the trip would serve as a public relations boost for Mr Yeltsin
before the elections, Mr Shokhin said that 'on the contrary it would help
strengthen the image of Europe' which had taken a long time to recognise the
progress made by Russia towards a market economy. But he admitted that
Russia and the EU were still at loggerheads over restrictions imposed by
President Yeltsin on western banks to win support for Russia's Choice from
powerful Russian banks.
Meanwhile, Mr Yeltsin's drive for a yes vote in the referendum on the draft
constitution received support from an unexpected quarter yesterday when he
prevailed upon leaders in the ethnically divided North Caucasus to endorse
the constitution publicly.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Slovak currency setback: Czech trade surplus forces
effective devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA, BRATISLAVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech and Slovak republics have re-adjusted their currencies under their
Ecu-based clearing agreement, leading to an effective 8 per cent devaluation
of the Slovak crown against the Czech currency for trade between the two
countries.
The adjustment does not affect the value of the two crowns against other
currencies but the change is important for domestic and international
companies operating in both halves of the now divided former Czechoslovakia.
Over the first nine months of the year Czech exports to Slovakia were
CzK54.37bn (Pounds 1.2bn) while Slovakia exported goods worth CzK47.54bn to
the Czech republic.
The change was made necessary by the rise in the Czech Republic's surplus in
the clearing balance to Ecu110m (Pounds 83.8m), close to an agreed limit of
Ecu130m, Mr Martin Svehla, spokesman for the Czech national bank said
yesterday.
In practice it means the Slovak crown, which was devalued by 10 per cent
against all currencies in July, has lost 18 per cent of its value against
the Czech crown since the start of the year. The move is expected to slow
Czech exports to Slovakia and boost Slovak exports to the Czech Republic.
The Slovak state secretary of privatisation, Mr Ivan Lexa, has been charged
with defaming the presidency, a government official said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Bratislava.
Mr Lexa, an ally of the prime minister, Mr Vladimir Meciar, suggested in
November that aides close to the president were involved in illicit
business, said Mr Jaroslav Ivor, an interior ministry official.
Mr Lexa could face two years in prison for the remarks.

FT  08 DEC 93 / GM nears final deal on joint venture in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors Europe is expected to reach final agreement next week to
begin assembling cars in Poland.
GM is planning to form a joint venture with FSO, the Polish state-owned
carmaker, to assemble the Opel Astra small family car in part of the FSO
plant in Warsaw.
In the first stage of the project GM is aiming to assemble annually up to
10,000 four-door Opel Astras from SKD (semi knocked-down) kits supplied from
its plants in west Europe.
GM will send painted car bodies from its assembly plant in Antwerp, Belgium,
for final trim and assembly in Warsaw.
Main components such as engines and transmissions will be supplied from its
plant in Bochum, Germany. Production is expected to start in the autumn of
next year.
In this initial stage of the venture GM is expected to invest about Dollars
25m (Pounds 16.7m). It will take a stake of around 70 per cent in the
venture, which is likely to have a workforce of around 250.
Under its terms, which have been under negotiation for more than two years,
GM envisages moving later to a more ambitious second stage in which cars
would be assembled from CKD (completely knocked down) kits, which would
require body welding and painting to be carried out in Poland. Output for
the second stage could be increased to 35,000 cars a year on three shifts
with a workforce of around 1,000. The second stage would increase total
investment in the project to around Dollars 60m.
As part of the planned co-operation GM would aim to take part in developing
the automotive components supply industry in Poland.
The company announced yesterday that ACG, the GM group's automotive
components subsidiary, had signed a memorandum of understanding with FSO and
its affiliate ZEM-ELK to set up a feasibility study into the establishment
of ventures in such component areas such as wiring harnesses, lighting,
metal and plastic components.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Russian prophecy of doom: A top regional reformer sees
trouble ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The following gloomy prediction is not the pre-election bombast of the
communists, but the prophecy of Mr Boris Nemtsov, one of Russia's
ground-breaking economic reformers and a candidate in this weekend's
parliamentary elections. 'Unfortunately the next year in Russia will be a
year of tremendous inflation, unemployment, strikes, factory closures and
very acute political conflicts. I see nothing good in the future.'
Mr Nemtsov is the 35-year-old governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, about
400km east of Moscow. His reformist credentials are impeccable. Until two
years ago, under its Soviet name of Gorky, the region was a closed centre
for the defence industry and the bleak site of Dr Andrei Sakharov's exile.
Under Mr Nemtsov's leadership, it has become a flagship for economic reform.
'Mr Nemtsov's record speaks for itself,' says Mr Anthony Doran, manager of
the European division of the International Finance Corporation, the private
sector arm of the World Bank. The region's 100 per cent backing for reform
was what led the IFC to pilot its small-scale privatisation programme in
Nizhny Novgorod. Since then, the region has privatised between 65 and 70 per
cent of its small businesses, auctioned off 1,000 trucks, and 'created a
demonstration effect for all of Russia', says Mr Doran.
Last month, Nizhny Novgorod launched a project to privatise land, a
contentious issue in Russia where even in Tsarist times most agricultural
land was farmed communally. Its first privatised farm is now receiving an
average of 30 visitors a day from all over the former Soviet Union who are
eager to duplicate the process.
Thus, Mr Nemtsov's acerbic attack on President Boris Yeltsin's economic
policies - together with his criticism of the president's draft constitution
for concentrating too much power in the hands of one man and his distress at
the way in which Mr Yeltsin handled the confrontation with parliament in
October - indicates an election more complex than a stand-off between
reformers and conservatives.
Instead, a contest is taking shape between different brands of reform, in
which regional leaders, with their hands-on experience, are advocating
policies at odds with those of Moscow's free marketeers.
Mr Nemtsov is highly critical of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the intellectual force
behind the Russian government's tight fiscal and monetary policies, and the
leader of Russia's Choice, the most reform-minded of the 13 parties
competing for seats in this weekend's elections.
'Let's write a letter to Gaidar and tell him what a cretin he is - he is
killing Russian business,' Mr Nemtsov says, sitting behind a desk on which a
photograph of the governor together with former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher is wedged between a computer and recent issues of The
Economist.
The burden of Mr Nemtsov's discontent is his belief that, while
privatisation should be pushed forward, the government's macro-economic
policy of restricting credits to the country's inefficient heavy industries
threatens to destroy Russia's economy.
Mr Nemtsov cites the local example of GAZ, one of Russia's leading
automobile manufacturers, which employs a quarter of Nizhny Novgorod's
working population. Tight credits have pushed GAZ to the brink of
bankruptcy, but instead of restructuring, the plant is on a four-day week
and threatening to lay off 20,000 workers - a move which in one fell swoop
could erode the strong public support for reforms in the region.
It could also send Mr Nemtsov plummeting from his current 78 per cent
approval rating in opinion polls.
'(Boris) Fyodorov (the minister of finance) and Gaidar's tight fiscal policy
is doomed,' says Mr Nemtsov, a former theoretical physicist whose
conversation is peppered with references to 'the idiot Gaidar'. 'They
(Fyodorov and Gaidar) think that if we stop giving the large factories soft
credits they will begin structural reforms. In fact, the contrary is
occurring - factories are raising prices and decreasing their production,'
Mr Nemtsov explains. 'They are not doing so because they are evil
communists, but because they are monopoly producers.'
Mr Nemtsov, whose views are shared by some other reformist regional leaders,
believes his disagreement with Mr Gaidar is not purely ideological. Instead,
he contends that Mr Gaidar has been 'bought off by Moscow bankers', who are
profiting from the very policies which are hurting heavy industry, and cites
the recent restrictions on foreign banks as evidence of Mr Gaidar's
dependence upon the financial lobby.
As an alternative, Mr Nemtsov favours the slower pace of reforms advocated
by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, who was instrumental in drafting Nizhny Novgorod's
regional reform programme and is the leader of the 'Yabloko' bloc.
Mr Nemtsov is in favour of lower interest rates, tax holidays and
'controlled inflation'.
Critics of Mr Nemtsov's ilk might not cut too deeply into the vote for
Russia's Choice, but they could form a chorus which will pose a more serious
challenge to Mr Gaidar's market economics than the shriller cries of the
extremist parties.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Sharp rise in French company failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The number of French company failures increased sharply in October, rising
to 5,629 from 4,177 in September, according to Insee, the national
statistics office.
The figures demonstrate the continued fragility of the French economy,
despite government claims that the worst of the downturn is over and that
recovery will start from the end of the year.
The number of business casualties in October, the highest for five months,
means that more than 62,000 companies failed in the 12 months to the end of
that month. This represents a rise of 9.9 per cent over the same period in
1991-1992.
Industrial companies, and particularly manufacturers of consumer goods, were
among the worst hit in October, along with hotels, cafes and restaurants.
Government officials said that an increase in the rate of business failures
often occurred at the end of a recession and that measures were being
implemented to aid small businesses.
Earlier this week, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, announced
increased financial support for struggling small businesses. He said that
CEPME, a body specialising in equipment financing for small companies, would
receive FFr200m (Pounds 23m) to extend in loan guarantees. Mr Alphandery
also urged commercial banks to follow the central bank in reducing the cost
of credit.

Buying and selling Swiss property will become much easier for foreigners if
a plan approved by the cabinet wins acceptance. It would enlarge the number
of holiday homes which can be sold to non-nationals and eliminate curbs on
foreign residents buying property for their own use.
There is no plan to ease restrictions on property purchases by foreigners
for investment. This means that some Swiss companies, such as insurance
companies, which invest widely in property, will want to continue regulating
the number of their shares held by non-Swiss.
The plan calls for replacing the criterion of nationality with that of place
of residence. A foreigner living in Switzerland or one who had lived in
Switzerland in the past for at least five years would no longer face
restrictions. For others, the principle of a continually declining national
quota for sales of holiday homes would be abolished, and the annual quota
would rise to 2,000 permits.

<TEXT>
The German government is set to give tentative approval today to the
revolutionary Transrapid magnetic hovertrain, intended to travel between
Hamburg and Berlin at 400km an hour.
New proposals submitted by the private-sector consortium backing the
project, involving Thyssen, Siemens and AEG, will increase private
participation and reduce the public sector risk exposure.
A final decision by the government on its backing for the project will be
taken only next year, according to Mr Matthias Wissmann, transport minister
and an enthusiastic supporter. By then it will have to meet with the
approval of Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, who has criticised previous
proposals as too risky.
The plan to be presented to the cabinet today involves a private arrangement
to run the Transrapid operations, but public-sector financing for the rail
line. The new trains - nicknamed the 'whispering arrow' - are intended to
run every 10 minutes between the two cities and reduce the current 3 1/2
 hour journey time to just one hour. The aim is to begin construction in
1996 and start running test trains by 2003.
The operating company, in which Lufthansa and the future independent German
railways would have stakes, would have an equity capital of some DM1.5bn
(Pounds 586m) and raise loans amounting to some DM3.3bn without any
government guarantees. The line would cost DM8.2bn, including debt servicing
and inflation, the consortium estimates.
The project has widespread backing among politicians as a vital project to
confirm Germany's leadership in transport technology. Government and
opposition remain divided, however, on its economic viability. Mr Uwe Jens,
economic spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats, yesterday gave the
scheme his blessing for its contribution to research and development.
However, the party's transport spokesman, Mr Klaus Daubertshauser, warned
that it could be 'an incalculable financial risk'.

Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman-turned-politician, is expected to face
prosecution on financial irregularity charges after the French national
assembly lifted his parliamentary immunity.
The 432-72 vote came in response to a judge's request to investigate alleged
misuse of corporate funds from Testut, a small near-bankrupt manufacturer of
weighing scales controlled by Bernard Tapie Finance.
The company has been used to extend loans to Olympique-Marseille, the
football club which Mr Tapie also controls, to buy football stars.
In a separate investigation, another judge has applied to parliament to lift
Mr Tapie's immunity from facing charges of bribing another soccer team to
lose to O-M last May.
Appealing to fellow deputies, Mr Tapie said yesterday: 'This assembly is
asked to cast the first stone at me. And this will allow others to cast
bigger, heavier stones perhaps at me, but perhaps they will also hit some of
you.'
Several, mostly Socialist deputies, have been implicated in alleged illegal
funding of political parties by businessmen seeking public contracts.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Brussels hits back over steel criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission hit back swiftly yesterday after seven of Europe's
biggest steel producers criticised its year-long efforts to restructure the
sector, saying the industry itself was responsible for excess production.
In an open letter to industry ministers on Monday, the companies from six
northern European countries had complained of 'totally inadequate' progress
by the Commission. They warned against reaching solutions 'at any price' to
the deadlock over state subsidies.
In response Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van
Miert, competition commissioner, said in a joint statement: 'It's not the
Commission but the whole steel sector that is responsible for current
production overcapacities.' Companies had not made one concrete offer to cut
capacity despite the Commission's decision to authorise a restructuring fund
backed by EC loans.
The two commissioners pointed out that the need for unanimous backing for
subsidy decisions put the Commission in an 'extremely delicate situation',
but it had managed nevertheless to win deep capacity cuts in most cases.
It said parties interested in resolving the steel crisis should resist
putting off decisions until the last minute or risk aggravating a situation
with 'catastrophic economic and social consequences'.
The Commission's steel rescue plan aims to entice steelmakers to close some
30m tonnes of excess crude steel capacity in exchange for European Union
money to help cover at least 50,000 job losses, import restrictions and
other assistance. Italy's refusal to accept demands for capacity cuts at
Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker, in exchange for approval of state
aid is the main stumbling block to an overall deal on subsidies.

FT  08 DEC 93 / EU urged to catch up with the world: The Delors White Paper
for the 21st century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When European Union heads of government meet for their summit in Brussels on
Friday they will be told that the creation of their single market has gone a
long way towards resolving the Twelve's competitiveness problems, but 'the
truth is that although we have changed, the world has changed faster'.
As a result, European Commission president Mr Jacques Delors, in a
much-vaunted White Paper on competitiveness, growth and unemployment, calls
for far-reaching changes to catch up. But he warns: 'If there were a miracle
cure, it would not have gone unnoticed.'
Indeed, the paper starts from the premise that Europe is facing an economic
and social crisis, of which unemployment is a main feature.
The Commission wants big changes in employment policy and a European 'social
pact' whereby gains in productivity would be ploughed into new investment
and the creation of jobs.
It also wants the EU to act as the catalyst for a big investment programme
in advanced telecommunications and information systems, and rail, road and
energy networks across Europe.
With unemployment expected to reach 20m next year, 'the EU should aim to
create 15m jobs by the end of the century,' the document says.
The framework for creating jobs and improving competitiveness, the document
underlines, must remain an open economy, trading within solid multilateral
rules after a successful Uruguay Round world trade reform deal, and monetary
stability, low inflation and gradually reduced budget deficits, to make
possible economic and monetary union and a single European currency.
But the White Paper, titled Tackling the Challenges and Moving into the 21st
Century, makes clear its main target is unemployment, while emphasising that
it is offering only broad guidelines for a complex problem offering no quick
fixes.
There is, one senior Commission official says, 'an ideological debate
between those who believe the (labour) market will clear if you just remove
a few obstacles, and those who believe this is a huge economic and social
problem' requiring government intervention, albeit by following the trend of
the market.
On the basis of the final draft, however, the latter views, identified with
Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, appear to
be winning out. But the paper could face a rough ride at the summit.
The UK, echoed by Unice, the EU employers' confederation which yesterday
produced its own competitiveness blueprint, is pushing hard for labour
market deregulation and reduced employment costs. Germany, moreover, as the
EU's main paymaster, may balk at the sums in the paper for funding
trans-European networks.
The White Paper rejects wage-cutting and pruning of welfare payments as only
likely to depress demand further, but also dismisses 'a generalised
reduction in working hours and job-sharing at national level' which could
slow down production.
The White Paper's diagnosis is familiar from earlier drafts. Over the past
20 years, unemployment has steadily risen from cycle to cycle, as the
European economy's potential growth rate has shrunk from around 4 per cent
to 2.5 per cent, the investment ratio has fallen by five percentage points
of gross domestic product and Europe has done worse than the US and Japan on
jobs, preserving export markets, matching research and development to the
market and developing new products.
Notably, the EU is failing to harness the growth potential in eastern
Europe, and is too slow in responding to 'an increasingly knowledge-based'
economy.
The document identifies three kinds of unemployment requiring different
treatment: cyclical unemployment, caused by low growth; structural
unemployment, perhaps two thirds of the total, caused by competition from
low-wage economies, the high cost of unskilled labour, deficient training
and over-protection of 'traditional industries' in decline; and job losses
caused by failure to adapt to the speed of technological change. Growth
alone, the document argues, would deal only with the first category.
It therefore advocates:
Advanced vocational training throughout people's working lives.
Labour market flexibility through retraining, flexible working hours,
measures to revive the rented housing market to stimulate labour mobility,
and (more gingerly) pricing people into work through unemployment benefit
cuts, but accompanied by minimum income guarantees.
Part-time working and job-sharing at company level, which companies such as
car maker BMW at Regensburger in Bavaria have shown can enhance use of
plant.
Reducing the cost of low-skilled labour by cutting social security
contributions on their jobs, to be financed partly by greater tax revenue
from the resultant expansion of employment. The paper also suggests that the
energy tax now blocked in the Council of Ministers and revenue from another
proposal to harmonise taxes on investment could also make up the difference.
Re-channeling more public spending on unemployment towards 'active' labour
market measures, including a big expansion of employment services for
job-seekers.
A subsidised expansion of 'social' services in areas such as environmental
protection, housing renovation and community care.
Officials underline that the trans-European networks programme is not a
public works proposal to create jobs, but a plan to make Europe more
competitive. A labour market strategy to create jobs is therefore essential.
'Recovery must be achieved principally by developing work and employment and
not by going for basically Malthusian solutions' which would create a
divided society, the White Paper concludes.

FT  08 DEC 93 / EU seeks to open up postal services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications ministers of the European Union yesterday called for
formal legislation to open up European postal services to competition, while
safeguarding common service standards for all customers.
The ministers asked the European Commission to produce draft legislation
before July next year, but they steered clear of the sensitive subject of
which postal services should be protected from competition.
They said the Commission should come up with a definition of these
'reserved' services, which could include basic domestic letter services.
Ministers also sidestepped the issue of exactly what should constitute a
basic minimum telephone service after 1998, when the EU telecoms sector is
completely liberalised.
Preparatory discussions between national officials had revealed sharp
differences of opinion between member states, such as Britain, which wanted
competition to be introduced into most sectors of the market, and others
which wanted to draw up a wider list of universal services to which all
customers have a right.
A compromise resolution approved yesterday will include a list of minimum
services already defined in other EU telecoms legislation. The actual
services supplied as a right to customers will be defined by the governments
themselves. The resolution says consumers will be entitled to 'a defined
minimum service of specified quality . . . and, in the light of specific
national conditions, at a reasonable price'.
Separately, ministers threw their weight behind a group of television
manufacturers, broadcasters and satellite operators who are working on new
standards for digital television broadcasts in the EU.
Ministers yesterday said common digital broadcasting standards were
essential to the development of the new technology, which promises more
channels and greater flexibility for consumers. But they said digital
television would be 'market-led'.
The group was formed by the German Telecoms Ministry in the aftermath of the
debacle over the Commission's original plans for the development of analogue
high-definition television, which foundered when broadcasters did not follow
the transmission standards laid down by the member states.
The EU strategy - watered down in the face of opposition from the UK to
extensive funding - is now based on the encouragement of wide-screen
television programmes and transmissions. References to set satellite
transmission standards will be excised from an earlier directive.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Paper calls for big new investments in 'info-highways' and
infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main causes of Europe's decline in competitiveness is the
slowdown in infrastructure investment of the past 10 years, according to the
Delors White Paper, writes David Gardner.
The challenges involved in moving into the 21st century therefore involve
big new investment in the 'information highways' of the new industrial
revolution, and in pan-European transport, energy and environmental
infrastructure, it says.
Developing an advanced information society and economy, the paper says, in a
characteristically Delors turn of phrase, 'is a crucial aspect in the
survival or decline of Europe'.
The development of new information technology, the White Paper envisages,
would be financed almost entirely by private capital, while the transport
and energy networks would be financed by a mix of public and private
funding. In both cases, the EU and member states would play an enabling and
catalytic role, and the White Paper emphasises that deregulation of the
telecommunications sector is vital.
The Commission also wants the EU to encourage inter-company co-operation on
research and development, in 'a limited number of major joint projects', not
only in information networks, but in bio-technology and eco-technologies.
The Commission proposes EU financing of about Ecu20bn (Pounds 15bn) a year
between 1994 and 1999. About Ecu5.3bn would come from the EU budget and
Ecu6.7bn would be in loans from the European Investment Bank. But a further
Ecu7bn could be raised, the paper says, by issuing 'Union Bonds' on the
capital markets, taking advantage of the EU's high credit rating. The
balance would come from a further new instrument, a 'convertible' bond
issued by a company funding a project, backed by the European Investment
Fund, set up a year ago.
The information technology drive, the White Paper estimates, would cost some
Ecu150bn over the next 10 years, and Ecu67bn in 1994-99 for eight 'priority'
projects.
The White Paper specifies areas where the effort should be concentrated,
such as developing a high-speed communications network. But Mr Delors wants
a 'Task Force on European Information Infrastructures' to be set up, with a
mandate from the Twelve to kick-start the projects by mid-1994.
The Commission, as envisaged under the Maastricht treaty, would play a more
leading role on transport and energy infrastructure. The White Paper reckons
Ecu250bn investment is needed by the end of the century, mainly in rail,
road, airport and gas pipeline infrastructure, building links within Europe
and to its eastern and southern neighbours. Eight projects requiring Ecu95bn
in 1994-99 are identified as priorities.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Industry unites against subsidies for VW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German employers yesterday united in protest against Volkswagen's efforts to
obtain state subsidies for the introduction of shorter working hours at its
six domestic factories.
The BDA confederation of employers' associations insisted that the vehicle
maker's rehabilitation plans had to be carried out without money from the
federal employment office.
The protest followed clarification of part of VW's plans, which call for
some of its 100,000 workforce to work normal hours for nine months of the
year and then be registered as unemployed - and paid benefit - for the
remaining three. They would then be rehired for a further nine months.
Describing the scheme as 'bogus' because the employees would remain tied to
VW, the confederation said the contributions of workers and companies to
federal unemployment funds were not intended to pay for 'general operating
cost reductions'.
VW, which has agreed with its workforce on a nominal 28.8-hour week (in
various formulations) for the next two years, claims its model would be far
less of a burden on state funds than the alternative: dismissing 30,000
people.
However, it has already promised that there will be no redundancies for the
duration of the draft restructuring agreement with the unions.
While the group says the scheme would reduce labour costs by around DM1.8bn
(Pounds 710m) a year, independent estimates put the cut at only DM1.3bn
(Pounds 510m).
It has also been pointed out that, with losses forecast to hit DM2bn this
year, Volkswagen in any case would be hard-pressed to finance redundancies
on the scale threatened. Observers say that state 'subsidies' would probably
be questioned by the competition authorities at the European Commission.
Details of a mounting deficit at the labour office, released yesterday,
suggest that it, too, could find it hard to justify paying partial
unemployment benefit.
The office faces a deficit of DM25bn this year, compared with the DM18bn
expected earlier, the Bonn government said in a written parliamentary
answer.
Any increase in the deficit, which will be covered by a federal subsidy,
could be paid for only by increased revenues or spending cuts elsewhere, it
added.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Ex-Montedison chairman held by Rome police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Police in Rome arrested Mr Mario Schimberni, 70-year-old former chairman of
the Montedison chemicals group, early yesterday and charged him with
deception and illicit distribution of dividends.
One of the most high-profile business figures in the late- 1970s and the
1980s, Mr Schimberni was forced from the chairmanship of Montedison in 1987
when the Ferruzzi family, led by the late Mr Raul Gardini, took control.
His arrest is part of the ever expanding investigations by Milan magistrates
into Montedison's affairs. The group was used first by Mr Gardini and then
by other Ferruzzi family members to make illicit payments to political
parties and to syphon funds into Ferruzzi overseas bank accounts.
The significance of the latest move is that the magistrates now appear to be
examining Montedison's books in the period before Mr Gardini assumed full
control.
According to usually reliable leaks from Milan magistrates, the charges
relate to the period 1984-86. The magistrates are attempting to trace some
L500bn (Pounds 202m) removed from Montedison's books and transferred to
accounts in the Netherlands Antilles.
There has been no previous mention of such a sum being missing so far back
in Montedison's accounts. Indeed, this is the largest single sum discovered
to be missing.
According to Ansa, the national news agency, investigations into Mr
Schimberni followed the discovery by Mr Guido Rossi, current administrator
of Ferruzzi-Montedison, of documents prepared by Mr Gardini. Further arrests
are expected.
Mr Schimberni, who was granted house arrest because of his age, was the
protagonist in some of the most controversial takeovers of the past decade,
including that of the Bonomi family's financial holding, Bi-Invest.
Milan police yesterday arrested Mr Alessandro Patelli, former treasurer of
the populist Northern League, on charges of violating party financing laws.
This is the first time the League has been implicated in the corruption
scandals.

FT  08 DEC 93 / W German economy grows 0.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The west German economy grew by a real 0.5 per cent in the third quarter,
compared with the previous three months, confirming signs of stabilisation
after the sharpest downturn since the second world war.
Latest federal figures show a positive growth rate for the past two quarters
 -there was a similar 0.5 per cent rise in the second quarter  - although
overall economic activity remains below 1992 levels.
The statistics were published as wage negotiations opened for Germany's
4m-strong engineering workers, with a clear stand-off between employers'
demand for a pay freeze and the IG Metall union's goal of 5.5-6 per cent.
However, the union is under great pressure to agree a moderate settlement as
unemployment rises steadily - by 489,000 in the past year - in spite of
indications that the economic slump has bottomed out.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, greeted the latest gross domestic
product statistics as confirmation that the economy is gradually recovering.
Private sector economists remain more cautious, while accepting that the
figures indicate a clear stabilisation.
'It is certainly too early to say this is the beginning of an upswing, but
it does show that the worst is behind us,' said Mr Peter Pietsch, chief
economist at Commerzbank.
The main factors behind the stabilisation are growth of private consumer
spending, and continued expansion in the construction sector. The former was
up 0.3 per cent on the same quarter in 1992, and building activity 1.8 per
cent.
Mr Rexrodt pointed out that comparing the third quarter with the previous
three months, all elements of domestic demand, with the exception of public
sector consumption, had picked up. This included investment in equipment,
which had slumped by almost 20 per cent over the five previous quarters.
Mr Pietsch warned that January 1 would see the introduction of a whole range
of new burdens affecting both consumer spending and industrial costs, among
them higher oil taxation, pensions contributions, car insurance premiums,
and nursing care insurance, totalling an annual DM40bn (Pounds 15.8bn).
'All those burdens will hold back recovery,' he said. 'Private consumption
has been surprisingly resilient during the downturn compared with previous
recessions. Consumers are attempting to maintain their spending at the
expense of saving. But next year all these extra burdens will affect
consumer spending.'
The economic squeeze on labour and industry will dominate the engineering
industry negotiations, which opened yesterday in both Bavaria and North
Rhine-Westphalia. In addition to a pay rise, IG Metall wants assurances of
job security. The employers are adamant that real cost cuts are needed and
have also served notice of cancellation of their holiday pay agreements.
Yesterday they announced they wanted to reduce the holiday bonus by half a
month's pay.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Swiss plan to ease property rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying and selling Swiss property will become much easier for foreigners if
a plan approved by the federal cabinet this week wins acceptance.
It would enlarge the number of holiday homes which can be sold to
non-nationals each year and eliminate curbs on foreign residents buying
property for their own use.
There is no plan to ease restrictions on property purchases by foreigners
for investment. This means that some Swiss companies, such as insurance
companies, which invest widely in property, will want to continue regulating
the number of their shares held by non-Swiss.
The proposals are less drastic than Switzerland would have been forced to
accept if it had joined the European Economic Area, the free trade pact
between the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
Swiss voters vetoed EEA membership in a referendum a year ago, but hard
pressed holiday property developers have been pressing hard for the Lex
Friedrich law restricting foreign ownership to be changed.
The plan calls for replacing the criterion of nationality with that of place
of residence. A foreigner living in Switzerland or one who had lived in
Switzerland in the past for at least five years would no longer face
restrictions.
For others, the principle of a continually declining national quota for
sales of holiday homes would be abolished, and the quota would rise from
1,420 permits a year to the maximum 2,000 allowed by the Lex Friedrich.
Distress sales or sales by one foreigner to another would no longer be
counted against the quota. Nor would purchases of time-share premises up to
16 weeks.
The justice ministry has set a January 17 deadline for comments, and intends
to put a final proposal to parliament in June. Provided no one insists it be
put to a referendum, the change could be in effect by November.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Hopes for trade accord rise after transatlantic deals:
France softens stance on farming subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID DODWELL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and the European Union yesterday lifted hopes of a successful
completion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks by settling a number of
bilateral disputes and throwing negotiations open to all 116 countries in
the round.
Hopes of success were raised further by European foreign ministers, who gave
a provisional seal of approval to the outline US-EU deal on market access.
In a significant shift, France indicated it was ready to accept a bilateral
pact on agriculture, which includes revisions to the hotly contested Blair
House accord limiting subsidised farm exports. France has consistently
threatened to veto a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord unless
the 1992 Blair House agreement is changed substantially.
In a move seen in Brussels as preparing French public opinion for a
potential settlement, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, declared:
'Blair House is dead. Another agreement has succeeded Blair House.'
However, diplomats in Brussels cautioned that a series of intra-European
disagreements could still threaten the deal.
After all-night US-EU negotiations in Brussels, first Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, and then Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart, flew
to Geneva to announce that all disagreements had been settled, with the
exception of US access to Europe's film and television market, and aircraft
subsidies.
The message to Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, was that
despite outstanding differences on two issues, the US-EU tariff-cutting
package was ready to be put before all countries negotiating in the Uruguay
Round. It will be used to lever bigger tariff-cutting offers from other
countries, in particular Japan, which is being pressed in financial
services, leather goods and processed foods.
The scale of the package agreed emerged during briefings in Geneva at which
the trade negotiators talked of EU tariff cuts to the US averaging more than
50 per cent. Products such as wood and paper have joined a lengthening list
of products for which tariffs have been slashed to zero. These alone are
worth Dollars 5bn to US exporters, Mr Kantor said yesterday. The US has
offered similar cuts to European exporters.
Big tariff cuts have been agreed on Europe's electronics sector, as well as
for US glass, ceramics and textiles. Apart from modifications to the Blair
House accord, the US has also agreed to add ocean shipping to its package of
liberalisation proposals.
The two have agreed terms for opening their multi-billion procurement
markets and on a new, more powerful multilateral trade organisation to
replace Gatt.
In Brussels, diplomats said a list of demands by France and other
disgruntled EU member states could still sink prospects for a settlement and
weaken Sir Leon's efforts to present a united European front in Geneva.
France wants to strengthen European trade weapons to match the US arsenal
and it is demanding a guarantee from its EU partners that French farmers
will not have to make cuts in production beyond those required by the Common
Agricultural Policy reforms agreed in May 1992.
Mr Juppe said negotiations within the EU would start today among EU
ambassadors in Brussels, continue at the Brussels summit on Friday and
Saturday, and only after a further meeting of EU foreign ministers would
France decide whether it would initial a draft Gatt accord.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Lloyd's Names set to reject Pounds 900m compensation offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday offered loss-making Names compensation of Pounds
900m in an effort to stave off years of crippling legal action triggered by
heavy underwriting losses over the past five years.
Early indications were that many of the worst-affected Names, the
individuals who have traditionally provided the market's capital base, were
likely to push ahead with litigation.
'We have stretched the society's resources as far as we could. This really
is the maximum the society can afford at this time in its history,'
explained Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive.
'The council believes that the offer is fair and equitable and affords real
advantages when compared with the alternative,' said Mr David Rowland,
chairman.
Acceptance now would produce certainty about the amount Names would receive
for claims against the uncertain outcome of legal proceedings, he added.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working
Party, said: 'This is an inadequate offer and we are not prepared to accept
it.' The working party is an umbrella group linking 17,000 Names in 38
separate action groups. Names are claiming more than Pounds 3bn in damages,
mainly in legal action against their agents.
Leaders of individual action groups stopped short of condemning the deal
outright but there seems little hope of their recommending it to members.
Lloyd's aims to fund the deal with contributions of an estimated Pounds 400m
from errors and omissions insurers, which cover agents against legal awards
for negligence, and Pounds 50m in voluntary contributions from members'
agents, which channel Names on to syndicates.
The insurance market's authorities will supplement this with about Pounds
450m from its central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet
their obligations.
Names will receive individual offers, with compensation amounts reflecting
the likelihood of success of legal actions as well as a series of other
factors.
Names on catastrophe reinsurance syndicates, which were hard-hit by a series
of disasters in the 1980s, have been offered the most favourable terms, with
most offers between 30p and 40p for every pound of claims.
However, Names on syndicates that specialised in liability business and lost
heavily as a result of asbestosis and pollution awards fare less well, with
offers limited to less than 10p in the pound in many cases.
Mr Middleton said the total available to meet all awards which might be made
'would still fall short of the total value of all claims planned or
contemplated by action groups'.
Names' leaders argue that errors and omissions insurers should have
contributed more to the deal.
Names have until January 31 to decide on the deal. If they accept, they will
receive special credits, to be offset against Lloyd's debts or solvency
requirements.

FT  08 DEC 93 / Franco-German telecom link aims for global market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French and German state telecommunications companies announced a
strategic alliance yesterday, intensifying the battle between the world's
leading telecoms groups to become global 'super carriers'.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the second and third largest
international operators after AT&amp;T of the US, will establish an Ecu1bn
(Pounds 762m) joint venture to provide data and other advanced services to
multinational companies.
The venture will be the first stage of formal collaboration, which could
lead to exchanges of equity stakes between the two state-owned companies if
proposed changes to their legal status are carried through.
The heart of the alliance will be a state-of-the-art European 'backbone
network' providing companies with international private networks and
high-capacity data communications across the continent from early 1995.
The companies expect their venture, to be based in Brussels, to generate
revenue of Ecu1.5bn in its first year, and grow 'quickly' to 4,000
employees.
Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman of France Telecom, said: 'Europe needs a global
player in this area and we aim to provide it.'
The venture was seen by many analysts as a defensive move by the two
companies in the face of alliances formed this summer by AT&amp;T with
Asia-Pacific operators, and by British Telecommunications with MCI, AT&amp;T's
main US rival.
Although the Franco-German alliance is clearly in opposition to BT, it has a
more open attitude to AT&amp;T, itself anxious to establish a close relationship
with a European operator other than BT.
Mr Helmut Ricke, Deutsche Telekom chairman, said: 'We absolutely need an
American partner to provide a broad range of services,' adding it was
'obvious' AT&amp;T was the best qualified. He said negotiations were proceeding.
The alliance has strong backing from the French and German governments,
which are ready to resist calls from BT for competition between European
operators to be introduced before the 1998 deadline agreed by the European
Union in June.
The joint venture falls short of merging the public 'voice' networks of the
operators. Mr Ricke stressed that all the proposed joint services were
already deregulated within the European Union, and that the two companies
combined had only about 10 per cent of the European market between them.
By restricting the immediate scope of the venture, the companies hope the
European Commission will clear it by next Easter.
Mr Ricke expressed concern at the slow pace of privatisation in Germany, but
he said that its achievement was 'not a prerequisite' for a possible future
equity swap between the two companies.
Any pooling of the French and German 'voice' services using the public
network would be highly controversial as a potential block to pan-European
competition.
However, France Telecom indicated that no such move was likely until public
networks were open to full competition in 1998.
Mr Ricke said the companies were helping to 'secure Europe's position within
global industrial competition'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation, the Australian media and film company headed by Mr Rupert
Murdoch, last night withdrew its controversial plan to issue shares with
'super' voting rights to existing shareholders.
The plan, announced in October, created concern in Australia, where
differental voting rights are not currently permitted. Critics saw it as a
means by which the Murdoch family interests could establish an entrenched
controlling position at News Corporation.
The Murdoch family owns about one-third of News' shares, but its stake has
slipped as the company has been obliged to issue new equity to fund
acquisitions and pay down debt. The proposed scheme would have allowed the
family to stabilise its interest - and even increase it via further
purchases of 'super' shares, which provide multiple voting rights - while
the company could have continued to issue ordinary shares.
Mr Murdoch acknowleged that Australian authorities were unlikely to decide
on the scheme for many months. The News board had decided at a meeting in
London to withdraw the plan.

FT  08 DEC 93 / London allowances for civil servants to be ended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to abolish the London weighting allowances of up to Pounds
1,776 a year paid to civil servants working in the capital.
The Treasury proposes to replace allowances with a payment of up to Pounds
3,000 a year targeted at groups of staff which are hard to attract. It will
be payable in any part of the country where the civil service has problems
in recruiting and retaining staff.
The move comes at a time when many employers have frozen the allowances they
pay to London staff. Allowances paid by banks and other large businesses
reached Pounds 3,000 or more a year during the 1980s when many companies
experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff in the capital.
Civil servants currently receiving the allowance will retain their pay
levels so long as they continue to work in core government departments.
However, recruits and staff moving to London, will not receive the
weighting. The 24 agencies and departments which take over pay bargaining
for their own staffs next April will be free to make individual
arrangements.
The surprise proposal has been put to the civil service unions by the
Treasury. Officials have made it clear that while there is scope for
negotiation over the details, ministers are determined to proceed in
principle.
The new recruitment and retention allowance, due to be introduced on July 1
next year, would sweep away London weighting currently paid at three rates:
Pounds 1,776 in central London, Pounds 1,015 for offices between five and
ten miles from the centre and Pounds 736 for 10 to 18 miles.
It would also absorb other special allowances paid to staff in London and
regional offices with recruitment and retention problems. Currently, a local
addition of up to Pounds 1,000 a year is paid to some 65,000 civil servants
 -more than 40,000 of them in London.
A report published last year by the National Audit Office, the public
spending watchdog, said targeted allowances were a more economical means of
addressing local staffing problems.
The allowance would be paid at the discretion of departments and agencies to
meet 'vocational, discipline-related or other pay-related recruitment and
retention problems'. The payment would be up to a maximum of Pounds 3,000
per person a year.
Departments and agencies would be free to decide whether the allowance was
pensionable - present allowances and pay additions are pensionable. The
allowance could be changed, reduced or withdrawn if recruitment or retention
conditions changed.

Correction (published 10th Decemeber 1993) appended to this article.
A senior executive at Hoechst, the German chemical group, told a chemical
industry conference in New York yesterday that the company would seek a
listing for its shares on a US stock exchange some time after 1994.
Hoechst will be following in the footsteps of Daimler-Benz, the German motor
group, which in October became the first German company to list its shares
on a US exchange.
CORRECTION
Hoechst, the German chemicals group, does not plan to seek a listing in New
York some time after 1994, as wrongly indicated due to agency error on
Tuesday.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: UBS to sell kinegram gold bar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the leading suppliers of small gold bars
to the retail market, has launched a new line of bars designed to foil the
forger and tamperer, and attract new custom to the lacklustre gold trade.
The bars feature a highly complex, multi-coloured hologram-like pattern on
one face. The recently developed technology, called kinegram, is used on
some banknotes and security documents and is virtually impossible to copy.
The kinegram is very sensitive to disturbance. Anyone attempting to take
some of the gold out of a small bar and substitute tungsten or another
similarly dense metal would cause a distortion to the pattern that would be
visible to the naked eye.
UBS said that the level of forgeries in the world retail gold bar market was
still low, but it wanted to prevent it from growing.
The company also clearly wanted to give its gold bar marketing a lift. Mr
Fabio Torboli, an executive of the World Gold Council participating in the
launch, described the new bars as great fun. 'This market needed an
innovation,' Mr Torboli said. He predicted that the new bars would not take
away from sales of other gold products, but would bring in new buyers.
Mr Urs Seiler, the bank's metal trade manager, said the premium charge for
the new bars would average 3 per cent of the price of the underlying gold,
only 0.3 per cent higher than on ordinary bars. UBS was counting on higher
volume making the development worthwhile, he said.
Initially, the kinegrams will appear on five gram, 20 gram and one ounce
bars, but UBS said it intended ultimately to put them on all its bars. They
will be produced at the UBS gold refinery at Mindrisio near the Italian
border.

Mr Vittorio Ghidella has stepped down from almost all his positions at
Switzerland's Saurer engineering group following personal legal problems and
heavy losses at a Milan subsidiary.
The decision, 'for family reasons', follows Mr Ghidella's arrest earlier
this year in a judicial inquiry into alleged corruption at Oto Trasm, a
south Italian engineering company in which a local subsidiary of Saurer is a
shareholder.
Mr Ghidella faces charges regarding an alleged attempt to defraud Oto Trasm
by transferring machinery from its Bari plant to the Turin base of Grazioni
Trasmissioni, the north Italian engineering group in which Saurer has a 90
per cent stake.
He has rejected the accusations.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Italian markets make gains after clear poll win by left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's financial markets reacted favourably yesterday to the clear victory
of leftwing alliances in large cities in Sunday's second round of local
elections.
The Milan stock market rose by 3.3 per cent and the lira strengthened
compared with its Friday close against the D-Mark from L998 to L988.
This contrasted with nervous trading after the first round of local
elections, held on November 21, when the vote for the long-ruling Christian
Democrats collapsed, and coalitions supported by the former communist party
of the Democratic Left (PDS) did well across the country. In the aftermath
of those poll results shares on the Milan bourse fell by nearly 5 per cent,
the biggest drop in a year, while the lira also weakened.
Dealers said yesterday that the market took a positive view of earlier
commitments by Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, to ensure that the 1994
austerity budget passed through parliament. Mr Occhetto repeated these
commitments on Sunday as PDS-backed candidates won a total of 53 of the 129
towns involved in the run-off, including Genoa, Naples, Rome, Trieste and
Venice.
The budget is now likely to be approved by December 21, to be followed
shortly by the dissolution of parliament and the holding of general
elections in March. If the budget is approved in its present form, it will
lock any government into policies that will reduce the public sector deficit
to 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product from its current level of about
10.5 per cent.
The markets also appeared relieved that the neo-fascist movement, MSI, was
narrowly blocked in its bid to capture the administrations of Naples and
Rome. An MSI victory in either or both of these cities would have
radicalised the political climate. However the movement claimed on the basis
of the election results to be the largest single party nationwide with 16
per cent of the vote.
The brake on the rise of the MSI looked likely last night to stimulate the
search for a new centre grouping to fight the next general elections. Mr
Mario Segni, leader of the Referendum Movement for electoral reform and one
of the few figures of any stature capable of mobilising a centrist
coalition, was quick to stake out his candidature as a future prime
minister.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Russian miners call off coal stoppage: Threat to Yeltsin
poll hopes averted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian coalminers last night called off a strike which had threatened to
undermine President Boris Yeltsin's election campaign in the last days
before the poll.
Interfax news agency said that union leaders from the Arctic coal basin of
Vorkuta had signed a peace deal with the government and had agreed to resume
work today.
Earlier yesterday the strike had spread across three regions when the 30,000
Vorkuta miners were joined by thousands of workers in the Urals and in
northern Siberia. The Independent Miners' Union called out its members to
protest against non-payment of wages and over a range of other complaints.
Strikers also demanded a government reshuffle by Mr Yeltsin, who faces
parliamentary elections on December 12 and has traditionally enjoyed strong
support among miners.
Ahead of last night's peace deal, miners in the main Russian coalfield of
the Kuzbass were considering joining the strike today, according to Mr
Sultan Mamedov, deputy president of the Independent Miners' Union.
The strikers, who had produced a list of 25 demands, were most aggrieved
over long delays in wages payments and in the rapidly worsening situation in
the coalfields - as rail tariffs for coal carriage soar, increasing the
indebtedness of the pits and the insecurity of the miners. The government
has recently proposed a programme of closures of more than 40 pits
nationwide, including four of the 13 in Vorkuta, an area almost wholly
dependent on the mines.
A new finance and industry group has been established and charged by Mr
Yeltsin with the task of 'furthering the reconstruction of the Russian
economy, accelerating scientific and technical progress and raising the
export and competitive potential of Russian enterprises'.
Mr Yeltsin's decree establishing the group also orders the state committees
for industrial policy and for property to set up two 'experimental'
financial-industrial groups - an apparent attempt to create large industrial
holdings with their own banks and investment houses along Japanese lines, a
route which is favoured by many industrialists.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, has been admitted to
hospital for treatment of a kidney ailment. His press spokesman said his
condition was not serious and he would be back at work soon.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Options for divorce reform put forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quick, no-fault divorce after a year's separation, where partners do not
have to make any accusations, was one of the options for divorce law reform
outlined yesterday in a government green paper.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, launching the consultation document, said
he was aiming for a system which was 'better at identifying savable
marriages'.
Couples should be encouraged to face the consequences of divorce before
ending their marriages. But where divorce was unavoidable the system should
minimise the bitterness and conflict between parties and reduce the trauma
for children, he said.
About 75 per cent of the 150,000 divorces a year in England and Wales are
granted for adultery or unreasonable behaviour. The green paper suggests a
one-year 'cooling-off' period before divorce is granted on these grounds.

The price of providing leased and contract hire vehicles for National Health
Service staff has increased from Pounds 53.7m to almost Pounds 70.5m between
1991-92 and 1992-93, Mr Tom Sackville, health minister, told MPs in a
written answer.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said: 'These figures showing
grossly inflated budgets for cars for the NHS confirm the health service is
getting its priorities wrong.
'Such huge increases on company cars, especially for trusts, can only be at
the expense of patient care. The government has increased spending on
managers by 211 per cent since 1989.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Rover to switch staff to assembly line work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover Group, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is seeking
to transfer up to 1,000 indirect production workers and white-collar staff
on to direct assembly line production work next year, Kevin Done writes.
Mr John Towers, Rover Group managing director, has written to indirect
production workers and staff in the search for volunteers to switch to
direct jobs on the assembly lines in order to cope with an expected increase
of more than 10 per cent in output in 1994.
The company said that it was seeking to raise output without making any
significant increase in the total workforce of about 33,000.
Rover said that it had surplus indirect production workers in areas such as
logistics, materials handling and maintenance, and it was chiefly seeking
volunteers among these indirect workers to transfer to direct jobs on the
assembly lines or in engine and transmission assembly and body pressings.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Student union reform defended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday cited the weekend
disruption of his advice surgery by university students in support of his
proposal for student union reform.
He said he felt ashamed to represent the 'yobs' from Balliol College in his
Oxford constituency. He also attacked the incident in which Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, had eggs thrown at him during a
demonstration by about 90 students when he was opening new university halls
of residence in Liverpool on Saturday. Two students were arrested after the
protest against student grant measures in the Budget.
Opening the fourth day of Commons debate on the Budget, Mr Patten said it
had been 'an outrageous attack'.
He told MPs: 'Mr Portillo and his staff had eggs thrown at them, at least
one of which struck the chief secretary. I think that is disgraceful
behaviour on the part of university students.'
Mr Patten said events in Liverpool, Norwich and Oxford were 'extraordinarily
bad examples of bad behaviour by university students'.
It showed the importance of the proposed reform of students unions outlined
in the education bill, he said. The measure will end the unions' 'closed
shop' and allow students to opt out of them.
Mr Patten defended the government's student loans scheme and the Budget
decision 'accelerating the already-planned shift in student support from the
grant to the student loan'.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said he had no sympathy
with 'yobs', whether in Oxford or anywhere else, who threw eggs or acted
violently.
'I do not believe that helps the course of public or political debate,' he
told Mr Patten.
'But you must recognise the 10 per cent cuts (in student grants) year by
year for the next three years are not likely to be forgotten and will be
persistently resented.'
Mr Dewar repeated Labour accusations that Mr Kenneth Clarke's package was a
'pay-more-get-less Budget', adding that it had a 'mark of dishonesty about
it'. He said: ''We are going to face really difficult times ahead and I take
no pleasure from that.'
There would be a rise in social security spending, he acknowledged. 'But
that is not a rush of generosity to the head of the minister.
Mr Dewar said Labour had known invalidity benefit was 'marked for execution'
 -but the incapacity benefit which would replace it was not an attempt to
reform or improve the welfare system.
'It seems a rather petty change which has a lot to do with minor savings for
the Treasury and some of the prejudices that can be found on the Tory side
of the house.'
On the replacement of unemployment benefit with the new jobseeker's
allowance, Mr Dewar said Labour recognised parliament could change the
rules.
'The question is not 'can we do it?' but 'should we do it - and what does it
do to confidence in the contributory system?'.'

<TEXT>
The French wheat growers' association yesterday reacted coolly to news from
Brussels of a proposed transatlantic farm trade deal that included several
American concessions.
The association welcomed apparent US agreement to reduce the impact of
initial cuts in subsidised farm exports by choosing last year's level of
exports, rather than the lower 1986-89 average, as the basis for reductions.
But it said it was still unclear whether the US would agree to restrain its
corn gluten feed exports to Europe and whether cuts in subsidised exports
could be adjusted upwards to take account of growth in world cereal demand.
Meanwhile, an alliance of labour-intensive industries in France yesterday
banded together to denounce the Balladur government for overlooking their
interests. 'France has been wrong to give preference to two dossiers - that
of agriculture and the audiovisual sector,' Mr Dominique Jacomet,
vice-president of the country's textile federation, told a press conference.

Mr Robert Malval said yesterday that he still planned to resign as Haiti's
prime minister on December 15, despite US pressure to remain in office, but
would continue as acting prime minister until a compromise successor could
be found, George Graham reports from Washington.
'According to law, I have to stay as acting prime minister until a successor
is named,' he said, after talks in Washington with Father Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the Haitian president, who was ousted two years ago by a military
coup.
Mr Malval had intended to serve as temporary prime minister to oversee
Father Aristide's return to Haiti, set for last October but not yet
effected.
However, the premier's position has been uncertain, amid much violence in
Haiti, local military leaders having reneged on their agreement to this
UN-brokered plan.

The European Union agreed yesterday how to distribute research funds in the
next five years, with information and communications technologies receiving
the most, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The research ministers' decisions were conditional on agreeing an overall
budget, EC officials said. The ministers were also still discussing how to
reform the EC's Joint Research Centre.
The European Commission has proposed spending Ecu13.1bn (Pounds 10bn) on the
so-called 1994-98 Fourth Framework Programme, which will channel money to
companies and research institutes across Europe. But Britain, France and
Germany, the biggest contributors to the research budget, say that is too
high.
The ministers agreed information and communications technologies should get
28.2 per cent of the budget; energy 18.15 per cent, industrial technologies
16 per cent; and biotechnology and other life sciences 13.1 per cent.

The Ukraine government and central bank have banned bank loans until January
to fight hyperinflation, but bankers have said the move could ruin the
banking system, Reuter reports from Kiev.
A joint statement from the government and central bank said the ban, which
took effect late last week, affected both central bank affiliates and
commercial banks.
'Issuing loans in Ukraine is banned until the end of the year because of the
country's very difficult financial situation. Bankers who violate the new
rules could face criminal charges,' the statement said. It gave no details.
Leading Ukrainian bankers condemned the decision and accused the government
and central bank of trying to take control of commercial banks.
The move follows the government's suspension of transactions on Ukraine's
sole currency exchange last month in an attempt to contain the collapse of
the financial system.

<TEXT>
European governments must address the difficulties facing the steel industry
and back plans for cuts in production, Mr Francis Mer, chairman of
Usinor-Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group, said yesterday.
Directing his comments at a meeting of European Union industry ministers
scheduled for December 17, Mr Mer said European governments had been using
'artificial means' and subsidies to maintain production at steel plants.
'Industry members have been seeking to reduce production to support prices,
while European governments have been acting irresponsibly.'
Mr Mer said the EU steel industry needed to cut output by about 30m tonnes:
20m in rolled steel and 10m in flat. He described the current situation as
'dire' and said that next year was likely to be as bad. 'There is surplus
production in Europe and we need to shut some of it down,' he said.
He cited Ilva in Italy and Ekostahl in Germany as examples where stronger
action was necessary. In the case of Ilva, he said its loss-making Cogne
subsidiary should be closed. He also expressed concerns about a joint
project between Ekostahl and Riva of Italy to expand production. He
estimated that the project would create up to 2m tonnes of new steel
supplies.

A letter bomb badly injured a legal clerk yesterday and Austrian police
defused three more devices in a wave of attacks against refugees and
supporters.
Four people have been injured by the bombs in the past four days, including
Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's Social Democratic mayor, who lost several fingers
in a blast on Sunday night.
Tha attackers have been labelling the devices with the name of a 17th
century hero, according to Mr Franz Loesnack, the interior minister,
suggesting the letters might be coming from the country's extreme right.
'We're fighting back. Count Ruediger von Starhemberg' was found on four of
10 letter bombs intercepted by police, he said.
In 1683, Count Ernst Ruediger von Starhemberg successfully defended the
Austrian capital against a siege by the armies of the Ottoman empire. A
later Count Ernst Ruediger Starhemberg took part in the 1923 Munich putsch
by Adolf Hitler and went on to become interior minister and vice-chancellor
in the fascist Dollfuss regime before the second world war.
The attacks began on Friday injuring a Roman Catholic curate and a
Croatian-born television presenter of programmes aimed at immigrants. Most
of those targeted since have been active in helping refugees, foreigners or
minorities in Austria.
The recent influx of a large number of refugees from the former Communist
countries and Yugoslavia has been exploited by right-wing politicians
including neo-Nazi groups angered by what they describe as a foreign
invasion encouraged by a duplicitous government.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Time slips away for Romanian reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Romania must take tough decisions within the next six months or lose the
chance to reform its economy, Mr Mircea Cosea, Romania's recently appointed
economic reform co-ordinator, said in London yesterday.
'We have wasted too much time before getting down to serious structural
economic reforms,' he admitted.
In an interview during an investment conference organised by the
Confederation of British Industries, Mr Cosea, the deputy prime minister,
said he would use the new executive powers granted to his economic reform
council last month 'to eliminate loss-making enterprises, speed up
privatisation and liberalise the foreign exchange market'.
The latter is of top priority. The reluctance of the shaky coalition
government led by Mr Nicolae Vacoroiu to allow the leu, the Romanian
currency, to be determined by market forces has been a main sticking point
in long negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a new standby
agreement.
'Without a real exchange rate the entire economy is distorted, leading to
degradation and deformation,' Mr Cosea said. 'But up until now the
government has feared to act because of the social consequences of the
probable 28 to 30 per cent devaluation of the leu which would result.'
But an estimated Dollars 3bn in finance from the IMF, the World Bank and
other institutions hangs on parliamentary approval of the terms of IMF
memorandum negotiated recently in Washington. Mr Cosea forecasts that
parliament will approve the tough IMF terms by February, although it may be
necessary to introduce temporary heating and energy subsidies to ease the
pain.
'Once the forex system is liberalised, I will push parliament to reform the
land laws to allow foreigners to buy land.
'This is essential to attract the equity investment which we desperately
need to modernise the economy and keep unemployment from rising much above
current levels around 10 per cent of the labour force,' he added.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Pit strike threat to Yeltsin's poll hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strike which spread yesterday across three regions in Russia's coal
industry could undermine President Boris Yeltsin's election campaign in the
last days before the poll.
More than 30,000 miners in the Arctic coal basin of Vorkuta were joined
yesterday by thousands of workers in the Urals and in northern Siberia
All but one of Vorkuta's 13 mines were closed yesterday, along with four
mines in northern Siberia, as the Independent Miners' Union called out its
members to protest against non-payment of wages and a range of other
complaints.
Only a small proportion of the workers in the industry have joined the
strike but Mr Yeltsin, facing parliamentary elections on December 12, has
traditionally enjoyed strong support among miners. Strikers are also
demanding a government reshuffle.
Miners in the main Russian coalfield of the Kuzbass were considering joining
the strike today, according to Mr Sultan Mamedov, deputy president of the
IMU. The news agency Interfax reported last night that pit leaders would
decide today.
Mr Yuri Shatyrenko, deputy labour minister, said last night the government
working group which is dealing with the miners' demands had settled most of
them. He said: 'In my view, these strikes are illegal - they were called
while negotiations were still being held.'
The strike could bring power cuts later in the year because the early onset
of a severe winter has greatly raised energy demand.
The strikers, who had produced a list of 25 demands, are most aggrieved over
long delays in wages payments and in the rapidly worsening situation in the
coalfields - as rail tariffs for coal carriage soar, increasing the
indebtedness of the pits and the insecurity of the miners. The government
has recently proposed a programme of closures of more than 40 pits
nationwide, including four of the 13 in Vorkuta, an area almost wholly
dependent on the mines.
A new Finance and Industry Group has been established and charged by Mr
Yeltsin with the task of 'furthering the reconstruction of the Russian
economy, accelerating scientific and technical progress and raising the
export and competitive potential of Russian enterprises'.
Mr Yeltsin's decree establishing the group also orders the state committees
for industrial policy and for property to set up two 'experimental'
financial-industrial groups - an apparent attempt to create large industrial
holdings with their own banks and investment houses along Japanese lines, a
route favoured by many industrialists.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, has been admitted to
hospital for treatment for a kidney ailment. His press spokesman said his
condition was not serious and he would be back at work soon.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dozens of towns and villages in the eastern German state of Brandenburg will
vote in a second round of local government elections on December 19, after
many candidates failed to secure a majority, or because of irregularities.
However, officials from the Social Democratic party, which governs
Brandenburg, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union,
yesterday said provisional results were expected to remain unchanged.
The party that gained the most from a 61 per cent turnout - which clearly
reflected disillusionment with the established political parties and
particularly Mr Kohl's governing coalition, led by the CDU - was the
reformed Communists.
The Party of Democratic Socialism gained 21 per cent of the votes, 10
percentage points more than in the December 1990 federal elections in
Brandenburg. The SDP increased its share by 2 points to 34 per cent, and the
CDU saw its share of the vote fall nearly 14 points to 20 per cent.
The PDS is even in a strong enough position to clinch Potsdam, the state
capital, in the run-off. Mr Rolf Kutznutz, a one-time self-declared informer
for the Stasi, or former east German secret police, obtained 43.5 per cent,
leading Mr Horst Gramlich, the SPD incumbent, with 30 per cent.
Interestingly, support for Green/Bundnis 90 - a loose collection of
democratic opposition parties - was nowhere near the party's sharply
increased backing in the western states. It received 6 per cent, an
indication that environmental issues are far less important in the east.
Also curious is that the greatest support - so far - is for an independent
candidate. Mr Wolfgang Pohl was elected mayor on first count for
Frankfurt/Oder, one of the four most important cities in Brandenburg, after
receiving 61 per cent of the counted votes.
Final results were expected late last night. Officials admitted the counting
was 'a bit slow', but added that three sets of elections had to be counted:
elections to the councils, elections for mayors, and elections for
Oberburgermeister, the equivalent of England's Lord Mayors.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (14): New hope for old smokey -
Coal combustion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone in the UK could be forgiven for regarding coal as a dirty, dying
relic of the industrial revolution, as the electrical generating companies
dash to build gas-fired power stations and the country's collieries close at
an unprecedented rate.
Such a parochial view would, however, give an entirely misleading picture of
the international scene. Coal is maintaining its share of the global market
for power station fuels - and more than Dollars 1bn a year is being spent
worldwide on research and development to make coal burning a cleaner and
more efficient way of generating electricity.
Although soot and dust may be a local nuisance, the main pollutants on a
global scale from burning coal are carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides. CO - the main contributor to man-made global warming - is
inevitably the primary product of the heat-releasing reaction of the carbon
in coal with the oxygen in air; its emission can be reduced by increasing
thermal efficiency, but not eliminated.
On the other hand, SO and NOx - the main causes of acid rain - are
by-products of the combustion process. They arise from oxidation of sulphur
and nitrogen impurities in the coal and nitrogen in the air. Clean coal
technology offers far more scope for reducing SO and NOx than CO emissions.
Today's dominant technology for coal-fired power stations - 'pulverised
fuel' combustion - dates back 60 years. The coal is crushed finely and blown
into a large boiler. Its burning releases heat to produce steam to drive a
turbine generator.
In practice, most pulverised fuel plants achieve thermal efficiencies in the
33-35 per cent range, although the very best (in Denmark and Japan) manage
to exceed 45 per cent efficiency. Further increases in efficiency,
accompanied by reduced NOx and SO emissions, can be expected in future
through a range of improvements in combustion conditions, the steam/water
circuit and turbine design.
But the main emphasis in clean coal research is not on improving traditional
pulverised fuel technology but on two newer approaches: fluidised bed
combustion (FBC) and gasification. Walt Patterson, energy analyst, describes
the the 'impressive progress' on both fronts in a new FT Management Report
on coal technology*.
'Many of the world's largest engineering firms are pursuing technologies
based on these concepts, dedicating major commitments of finance, skills and
time,' he says. 'Their efforts are bearing fruit. New units continue to come
on stream around the world month by month; many are achieving impressive
records for reliability, efficiency, fuel flexibility and emission control.'
FBC is the further developed of the two approaches. It involves burning
powdered coal in a bed of pulverised limestone which acts as a chemical trap
for any sulphur emitted from the fuel. The bed is kept in constant motion,
like a boiling liquid, by a strong upward flow of air. Steam produced by
boiler tubes in the fluidised bed drives the main generating turbine; the
hot exhaust gases may drive a second turbine.
The main variants for power generation are circulating FBC (CFBC) in which
the air flows so fast that the bed loses its upper surface and fills the
combustion chamber with a turbulent cloud of fine particles, and pressurised
FBC (PFBC) in which the whole chamber operates at between five and 20
atmospheres pressure.
CFBC is already fully commercial, with more than 100 units operating
worldwide. The technology makes it possible to burn dirty and low-grade
coals. Many CFBC plants have been built within cities for cogeneration -
producing both electricity and heat (for district heating or industry). The
largest so far is a 165MW unit at Point Aconi in Nova Scotia, Canada.
PFBC has only just crossed the commercial threshold, led by ABB Carbon, the
Swedish power engineering company. Three successful PFBC demonstration
plants in Stockholm, Escatron (Spain) and Tidd (Ohio, USA) will be followed
by a fully commercial 350MW plant at Karita, Japan.
The principle of turning coal into a fuel gas - reaction with steam and
oxygen to produce a combustible mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon
monoxide - has been known and applied since the last century, when coal gas
lit Victorian cities. But it is only now being developed for power
generation, in the form of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
plants. In IGCC, the hot coal gas passes through a chemical cleaner to
remove pollutants and generates electricity in a gas turbine. Meanwhile
waste heat from the turbine and gasifier raises steam to drive a second
turbine.
An important milestone for IGCC will be the start-up scheduled for this
winter of a 250MW demonstration plant, designed by Shell, at Buggenum in the
Netherlands. Several other IGCC plants are under construction in Europe and
the US (where the federal Clean Coal Technology Programme is funding five).
Both PFBC and IGCC promise thermal efficiencies at least as high as the best
pulverised coal plants, with much better control of SO and NOx. But it may
be possible to go further by combining the best features of each approach.
Hybrid designs such as British Coal's experimental 'topping cycle' would run
a gas turbine at very high temperature and a steam turbine at lower
temperature; given further progress in turbine technology, this could raise
overall efficiency above 50 per cent.
A more futuristic prospect is to combine gasification with a fuel cell,
which would generate electricity directly from the chemical reaction between
fuel gas and oxygen, like an extremely hot battery, without the need for a
gas turbine. Experimental 2MW coal gas fuel cells are due to be operating in
the US by 1997. The 'integrated gasification fuel cell' could ultimately
achieve an efficiency of 60 per cent - offering a reduction of one quarter
in CO emissions compared with today's best coal-fired power stations.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (12): Lighter vehicles will be
cheaper, cleaner - John Griffiths on trends in the motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The motor industry has been making great strides in improving the efficiency
and performance of the petrol and diesel engines which power most of the
world's cars. A current petrol engine, with multi-valves, fuel injection and
electronic management consumes about one-third less fuel than a simpler,
similarly-sized and carburettor-fed unit of the 1970s.
But this improvement is barely reflected in the actual number of road miles
that a typical modern car can cover per gallon of fuel compared with its
1970s equivalent.
Weight penalties imposed by safety and environmental legislation are
offsetting much of the efficiency gain; yet more is being negated by
consumer preference for comfort and convenience features, from multi-speaker
audio systems to air conditioning.
Such weight increases are far from marginal. On the safety front, for
example, side impact protection bars, airbags and seat belt pre-tensioning
systems in the last two to three years have begun adding considerably to the
weight of the body structure.
Conforming with ever-stricter exhaust emissions standards has meant
introducing catalytic convertors into the exhaust system, with a variety of
plumbing to allow the system to operate correctly such as exhaust gas
recirculation, sensors and electronic management.
Such systems are destined to become heavier and more complex yet, as
additional equipment is installed to bring the catalytic convertor up to
operating temperature more quickly.
Consumer preference is imposing possibly the biggest burden. Electric
windows and sunroofs, central locking, memory-adjustable seats and the like
have led to a proliferation of electrical motors and other heavy hardware.
The scenario envisaged by motor industry engineers in the early 1980s was
that improvements in combustion technology would permit a 'virtuous circle'
to develop in terms of the whole vehicle.
Smaller, lighter engines could be built for no loss of power. These in turn
would allow smaller, lighter components to be introduced elsewhere in the
car. Because these would require less power to propel them, engine size
could again be reduced without loss of on-road performance. And because the
weight of all the mechanical elements of the car would be much reduced, the
body shell itself could be made lighter and less complex because it would be
subject to lighter loads and stresses.
As a consequence, fuel consumption would have diminished sharply. Instead,
car weights, size-for-size, have increased - and left the industry searching
for some form of engineering 'quantum leap' to improve net fuel economy.
That leap may be imminent: in October commercial production began at the
world's first plant for the volume production of aluminium car body
structures.
Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) has invested DM120m (Pounds 50m) in the
plant, at Soest in Germany, to supply the Volkswagen group's Audi car plant
at Ingolstadt. They will form the skeleton of the new luxury Audi 300
saloon, of which Audi hopes to sell 15,000 a year from next spring.
The Alcoa plant has capacity for 100,000 structures a year, and other future
Audis can be expected to have aluminium instead of steel bodies, with even
mainstream, very high volume cars such as the Volkswagen Golf not ruled out
as a longer term prospect for production in aluminium. The concept offers
substantial weight savings over steel, and thus better fuel consumption -
but at substantially higher raw material cost.
Mr Eric Winter, manager for automotive products at Alcoa's technical centre
in Pennsylvania, says Alcoa is talking to 'a number of automakers' about
similar projects in Europe and North America.
Mr Franz-Josef Paefgen, head of body development at Audi, leaves no doubt of
his own conviction that the system provides the industry's needed 'quantum
leap' - which is exactly how he describes it.
A car's body, he declares, typically accounts for between 20 and 30 per cent
of total vehicle weight.
The energy efficiency implications, he stresses, are important because a 10
per cent lighter vehicle yields a 7 per cent reduction in fuel consumption.
The body of the aluminium car, says Mr Heinrich Timm, manager of Audi's
fundamental concepts activities, is 40 per cent lighter than its steel
counterpart would have been.
In terms of the energy efficiency of car manufacture, another significant
advantage of the aluminium structure is that it has only about one-third the
number of body parts that a steel monocoque contains.
Thus not only does it require far fewer joints than the 3,000 spot welds
which keep a typical steel-bodied family car together - a self-piercing
riveting process is being used for the first time ever to assemble a car
'body in white' (the basic shell structure), instead of spot welding.
The welding of aluminium is in any case difficult and requires high energy
inputs. The riveting system, developed by Henrob, a small specialist company
based at Flint in North Wales in partnership with Audi, is mechanical,
quiet, generates no fumes and consumes relatively small amounts of energy.
Rivets, however, do have to be manufactured and purchased. And there is one
energy disadvantage not suffered by steel: the completed bodyshell has to be
heated to 2100C for 30 minutes to give it the required strength.
Other lightweight materials are being investigated in pursuit of greater
efficiency, prominent among them magnesium and plastic composites. Like
aluminium, magnesium suffers from the drawback of requiring a much higher
energy content than steel in its manufacture - although this is more than
offset in the case of aluminium by the ease with which it is recycled.
Recycling is also the biggest problem facing plastic composites.
Thermoplastics can be melted down and used again, but only in lower grade
applications (from a body panel to a coffee pot, for example). With other
composites it is difficult to do much more with them than chop them up and
burn them as an energy source.
Meanwhile, the steel industry is fighting back.
Working with some vehicle makers, they have begun the development of car
body engineering that they say could make steel bodies up to 30 per cent
lighter.
The aim is to improve the rigidity-to-weight ratio of the body structure,
thus identifying which parts could be strengthened in order to allow more of
the body to be lightened.
Development of more energy-efficient engines and transmissions continues.
However, it is all too easy for laudable goals to be in conflict. Two-stroke
engines such as those developed by Western Australia's Orbital Engine
Company, are a case in point.
Two-strokes have no valves and thus none of the heavy and complicated
components needed to operate them. The Orbital is half the size of a
conventional engine of similar capacity and saves about one-third the weight
of a conventional unit. Size for size the engine is 10 per cent more
powerful and 12 per cent more economical than its conventional rivals.
Ford has a fleet of around 20 Orbital-engined Fiesta cars operating in
Europe as prototypes.
But despite these obvious advantages in terms of energy efficiency, Ford is
having increasing difficulty with exhaust emissions of the units and its
hopes of using the engines in production cars of the mid- to late-1990s have
been receding.
The problem is the amount of nitrogen oxides the engines emit.
With electrically-powered and other 'alternative' fuelled vehicles also
encountering increasing technological difficulties, there is an upsurge in
popularity of the diesel engine in some parts of the world.
The diesel is changing its image rapidly from noisy, dirty and slow to a
smooth and capable performer for most volume car applications - and with
fuel economy overall at least 20 per cent better than that of a petrol
equivalent. More significant, as traffic congestion increases, is that the
diesel is at its most economical in stop-start urban conditions, when
economy of a petrol engine is at its worst.
As drivers have become aware that the performance penalties of 'driving
diesel' are rapidly failing, so diesels' market share is rising in most
countries. In the UK, where only a few thousands diesels were sold a decade
ago, diesels now account for more than one in five cars sold - and the
proportion is still rising.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (13): The time has come -
Cogeneration proliferates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A century after Britain built its first combined heat and power plant, the
concept is finally taking hold.
Within the past 10 years the number of CHP, otherwise called co-generation,
plants in the UK has increased more than fivefold to about 600, with about
half of the growth coming in the last five years.
About 2 to 3 per cent of electricity is generated through CHP plants. If
government targets are reached, the 2000 megawatts of electricity generated
will more than double to 5000MW by the year 2000.
The appeal of CHPs is that unlike ordinary generators, they recapture the
waste heat released during combustion, and use it to raise steam, hot water,
heating, or more electricity.
They can thus produce heat and electricity at once and are much more energy
efficient than ordinary systems. Whereas conventional power stations have an
efficiency of about 35 per cent, CHP plants are up to 90 per cent efficient.
Their attraction is that they can reduce companies' electricity bills and
contribute to improving the environment.
According to the Combined Heat and Power Association each 1,000MW of
cogeneration electricity displaces other forms of power generation and heat
supply to save 1.25m tonnes of carbon emissions. It will also save on
nitrogen emissions.
Cogeneration's growth in the past decade owes a lot to the development of
technology, much of it in the UK, which makes it affordable to relatively
small electricity consumers. The cheapest units can be installed for less
than Pounds 40,000.
Most sites where CHP was installed in recent years use less than 1MW of
electricity. There are about 400 schemes in this category, including hotel
chains, leisure centres and hospitals.
Expansion among larger industrial customers has been less impressive. The
economics of CHP schemes make them less attractive for large industrial
concerns. Larger schemes have more difficulty in finding a use for the heat,
typically three times the amount of electricity in megawatts, and are
subject to more red tape.
There are about 150 industrial and commercial applications for CHPs in the
3MW to 50MW category in the UK as well as four urban schemes developed in
conjunction with community heating.
Industries which require large amounts of heat, such as paper and chemicals,
are suitable participants.
Thus Hydro-Electric, the Scottish utility which is among the most active of
the electricity companies in cogeneration, recently concluded a deal with
Dover Harbour Board and Arjo Wiggins, the paper maker, for a Pounds 7.25m
plant in Dover.
One of PowerGen's first forays into CHP was for the supply of 80MW of
electricity and 200MW of steam to three paper factories in Kent.
PowerGen has recently formed a CHP subsidiary to co-ordinate such projects
and is committed to investing Pounds 60m in cogeneration.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, says that if it did not enter CHP projects
others would and 'we would lose share in the generation market'.
He says his company is interested in about 40 per cent of what it expects to
be a much enlarged CHP market at the end of the century, almost all of it
among large industrial companies. Hydro-Electric, meanwhile, sees
cogeneration as a way of earning non-regulated income in England and Wales
and has already set up three schemes and identified more than 20 other
potential sites.
While companies such as PowerGen, National Power, Scottish-Hydro and BP
Energy are all competing in the market for relatively large industrial
users, the regional power companies in England and Wales tend to specialise
in smaller scale projects.
Three of them, London Electricity, Norweb and Northern Electric, are
involved in joint ventures with Combined Power Systems, a company which was
involved in developing the technology which made the economics of
cogeneration work for smaller sites.
Most of the CHP operators, whether operating in large or small projects,
operate schemes whereby they install and maintain the units.
While all of this activity will in itself generate CHP growth, much of the
proposed expansion will depend on factors outside the cogeneration
industry's control.
Future developments will be strongly influenced by the relationship between
the price of electricity and gas. Many proposed CHP plants are awaiting the
government's review of the gas industry.
Most CHPs plants are gas-fired. Until industry can assess the likely effects
of the gas industry changes on prices it will be reluctant to go ahead with
proposed schemes.
Ministers can also influence CHP growth through easing red tape and other
restrictions surrounding their operation. 'Generating power is technically
quite simple but to set one up you need an extraordinary amount of
documentation,' says David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power
Association. 'The government's drive to reduce red tape through industry as
a whole should help,' he says.
Mr Michael Heseltine, industry secretary, showed readiness to oblige last
month when he abolished restrictions on companies which generate their own
electricity but consume less than 51 per cent of it. Previously they had to
hold electricity supply licences which meant their sales were subject to the
nuclear levy. From April 1 they will no longer have to.
The House of Commons environment committee welcomed such initiatives when it
reported last month on energy efficiency in buildings, but it suggested far
more could and should be done.
For example it wants the government to target 'easy pickings' such as
hospitals, prisons and military bases for potential CHP sites, and set a
target for CHP in government use.
The committee suggested that ministers should be more ambitious about what
could be achieved after the year 2000, noting that the government itself had
identified an ultimate potential of 20,000MW of CHP, four times the present
target for the end of the century.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (10): The picture is changing - The
south, where smuggling is a way of life / Traditionally, the region has felt
ignored by the government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hat Yai, a short drive from the border between southern Thailand and
Malaysia, has long been famous for its brothels, its barber shops - which
double as massage parlours - and its bird's nests, the local delicacy served
in the town's restaurants.
But Hat Yai's image is changing. The sleaze is still there but it's more
discreet. Now families from Malaysia pack the town's well-kept streets
looking for bargains in what local officials proudly describe as a shoppers'
paradise. The hotels put on upmarket shows. Hat Yai bustles with new found
prosperity.
The southern region of Thailand, stretching for more than 900km from Bangkok
down to the Malaysia border, encompasses 14 provinces with a population of
7.3m.
Traditionally the region, particularly its most southern part, has felt
ignored by central government. With a history of separatist struggles, the
south was mistrusted.
Political and military power in Thailand has been controlled by Bangkok, the
north and north-east. The south has been under-represented in parliament and
in the higher ranks of the armed forces.
Infrastructure developments in the south lagged behind those elsewhere in
the country. Few industries were set up in the area. Now the picture is
different. A new administration under Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister
who is himself a southerner, has committed itself to decentralisation and
stepping up developments in the south.
A new highway, described as a land bridge linking the east and west coasts
of the peninsula, has been given the go ahead. A 1,000-acre industrial
estate, including an export processing zone, is being built near Hat Yai.
Fish processing, cannery and furniture factories have opened up.
But change in towns like Hat Yai has not come about through government
policy. 'There are virtues in being so distant from Bangkok' says Mr
Weerapant Musigasarn of the local Prince of Songkhla University. 'We've
learnt to do things for ourselves and be self sufficient. This area has
always been a trading centre. Now we are capitalising on the growing
prosperity on both sides of the border.'
Evidence of growing cross border connections is everywhere. Each day 12
luxury buses leave Hatyai for Singapore. Shrimps and tuna, two of the
south's main exports, go to Singapore for local consumption or
transshipment.
Thailand has recently become the world's biggest natural rubber exporter.
Ninety per cent of the rubber is produced in the south. The bulk of exports
go out through Penang in Malaysia - only 200km on a four lane highway away -
rather than through Bangkok.
Last year more than 600,000 Malaysians visited the south. Each year about
40,000 Thai workers cross to northern Malaysia to harvest the rice crops -
some with work permits, but many without. The authorities in labour-starved
Malaysia do not interfere.
More wealthy Thais go to Penang and elsewhere in north Malaysia to shop and
visit friends and relatives: in the 1950s the Thai government banned the use
of Chinese in schools. Many southern entrepreneurs sent their children to
Penang to be educated.
'Our cross-border connections have helped the south develop an economy of
its own,' says Mr Chan Leelaporn, president of the chamber of commerce in
the southern province of Songkhla. 'We may not have much political power,
but our economic power is growing rapidly.'
Smuggling has been a way of life for years in the south: noodles go south,
electronic goods go north. Attempts at curbing the trade have been made, but
with little effect. Most officials seem to turn a blind eye to the trade,
worth millions each year - 'if you live in the south and don't buy Malaysian
goods, you must be mad,' says a Thai businessman. 'Here, cooking oil from
Malaysia costs 18 baht per kilo. It's nearly double that in Bangkok.'
Dismantling the various trade barriers between the countries of the
Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) has been a painfully slow
process. A more modest attempt at liberalising trade has been made through
the formation of cross border growth 'triangles'. Earlier this year
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia agreed on the formation of a growth
triangle linking the northern half of the Indonesian island of Sumatra,
southern Thailand and northern Malaysia, including Penang.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (11): Frustration among Moslems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The port in Pattani province in southern Thailand is packed with fishing
boats off-loading their catch, mainly from the rich fishing grounds around
nearby Vietnam.
Young girls crouch over baskets, sorting the fish. All the girls wear the
hijab, the Moslem headress.
'The workers are all Moslems' says Mr Woravit Baru, a Moslem scholar and
lecturer at the local university. 'But the towkay (boss) is Thai Buddhist or
Chinese.'
There are nearly two million Moslems in southern Thailand. In Pattani
province, they make up about 80 per cent of the population. Thailand is a
state imbued with Buddhist values and ideals, with the monarchy and the
bureaucracy functioning as an integral part of that world.
Southern Thailand's Moslem community has long resented the imposition of the
Thai state and its Buddhist values - 'this is a Moslem area, yet the state
governor is not a Moslem, most important officials are not Moslems and many
teachers come from outside' says Mr Woravit.
A guerrilla group, the Pattani United Liberation Organisation (Pulo), though
believed to have only 300 members, still pursues the goal of a separate
state. Thai officials blame Pulo for attacks earlier this year on a train, a
Buddhist temple and a group of soldiers in which at least six people died.
Pulo is also held responsible for the burning of more than 30 schools in
August. But locals say the burnings are the result of infighting in the
armed forces and feuds between powerful local families.
Whatever the truth behind these incidents, there is no doubting the
frustration local Moslems feel with what they perceive as an uncaring and
insensitive administration.
The semi-derelict Kruze mosque in Pattani is one of the region's more
important Moslem sites. Locals say officials should not have allowed a
Chinese temple to expand next door. The temple has now become a tourist
attraction. Each day coach parties of Chinese arrive to let off fire
crackers and make offerings to their gods, disturbing Moslems at prayer.
Most Moslems live in the villages and work in agriculture, mainly in rubber.
Rubber prices have been falling and income levels have dropped. In Pattani,
unemployment is higher than in any other southern province. Moslems say the
province's fish processing industry, the rubber factories and the canneries
are controlled by outsiders and little benefit goes to locals.
'We want to set up Islamic banks so that we can do business' says Mr
Worawit. 'But the government won't let us.'
Pattani's Moslems are keenly aware of the privileges accorded to their
fellow Moslems south of the border in Malaysia. The new administration in
Bangkok has pledged to make more effort to improve the living standards of
Moslems. Investors are being encouraged to set up factories in the area.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (9): Bangkok in miniature - Chiang Mai,
Thailand's northern capital / Chiang Mai has already begun to duplicate in
miniature the problems which have afflicted Bangkok, traffic jams and
pollution, compounded by a lack of urban planning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Chiang Mai, Thailand's northern capital, has come a long way since Ralph
Fitch, a London merchant visiting in 1587, admired the sturdiness of its men
and the beauty of its women and described the city as a 'very faire and
great town with faire houses of stone.'
Some of its residents would even say that Chiang Mai has gone too far.
Instead of building 'faire houses,' property developers have been furiously
throwing up concrete shop-houses, condominiums and petrol stations. The air
is filled with the dust and noise of road construction.
For the past five years, Chiang Mai has been a boomtown. Foreign tourists
and nouveaux riches Thai businessmen, escaping the heat and traffic
congestion of Bangkok, have flocked to the relatively cool climate of
northern Thailand for their holidays and weekends. Speculation on land
prices has enriched many of the locals.
The central government has contributed to the rapid development of Chiang
Mai by redirecting manufacturing investment away from the overcrowded and
polluted industrial zones around Bangkok and the eastern seaboard towards
remoter areas such as the north. Earlier this year, the duration of tax
breaks for investments in these areas was extended to eight years from six.
'This new move by the Board of Investment was a big step by the government,'
says Mr Pravit Arkarachinores, president of the Upper Northern Chamber of
Commerce and managing director of a Chiang Mai private hospital.
More than 80 companies are operating or have already reserved space in the
eight-year-old industrial estate in Lamphun, 30km from Chiang Mai.
They include Murata Electronics and Hoya lenses of Japan. Among the more
recent arrivals are Thailand's Hana Microelectronics, which is building a
factory and dormitory for 1,000 workers, and Driessen Aircraft Interior
Systems, the Dutch catering equipment manufacturer which was finding it
difficult to expand in Bangkok and wanted to avoid the high costs and
traffic congestion of the capital.
Although it is Thailand's second city, Chiang Mai has long been a fraction
of the size of Bangkok, with an official population of about 200,000
compared to capital's 6m.
Yet it has already begun to duplicate in miniature the problems which have
afflicted Bangkok - traffic jams and pollution compounded by a lack of urban
planning - thus undermining the very basis of its original allure for
tourists and industrialists from the south.
A report on environmental problems by the municipal authorities this year
contained a catalogue of woes, from inadequate rubbish collection to
encroachment by builders on to public land. The filthy main canals in the
city are described as a 'disgrace.'
Even in the new Lamphun industrial estate, waste disposal is a haphazard
affair, with electronics companies burying toxic waste in drums or burning
it inside in their yards on Saturday nights because of the complexity of the
paperwork required to send waste material out of the export processing zone.
'Fifteen years ago I left Bangkok and thought I'd made the right decision,'
says Mr Chayant Pholpoke, a travel agent better known for his environmental
activism as part of the 'For Chiang Mai' group which opposed the building of
a cable car up Doi Suthep, the mountain overlooking the town.
'Now I'm not so sure,' he adds. 'It's another Bangkok I'm afraid, partly
because people like myself (from Bangkok) are here.'
There is no sign of an end to the growth of Chiang Mai, and the construction
business has been boosted by plans to host the South East Asian Games in
1995. The town's 700th anniversary the following year may, however, give the
inhabitants a chance to reflect on what they are doing to a city once
renowned for its quiet Buddhist temples and clean air.
Mr Tanet Charoenmuang, director of the local government studies project at
Chiang Mai University, is scathing about the way the authorities have
planned - or rather not planned - economic growth in northern Thailand and
failed to spread development to outlying areas.
'Instead of learning from past mistakes - that people have made Bangkok the
centre of everything - they are now making Chiang Mai the centre of
everything,' he says.
Asked whether the focus on Chiang Mai, instead of just on Bangkok, is not at
least a start, he replies: 'They are both hells. Chiang Mai is following
Bangkok very closely.
'We will celebrate hell in three years from now when Chiang Mai celebrates
its 700 years,' he says. 'We live in a very 'special' era because of cheap
vehicles and very poor management.'
Unlike academics, most entrepreneurs in northern Thailand show little
concern for the environment, although they care about problems which could
affect their businesses - including infrastructure difficulties such as a
lack of telephones, a shortage of skilled workers and the spread of the
human immunodeficiency virus that causes the disease Aids.
Far from worrying about the 'Bangkokisation' of Chiang Mai, local Thai
businessmen fear that the rapid growth of the rival town of Chiang Rai -
further north, as a centre for tourism and trade with China, Burma and Laos
 -will turn Chiang Mai itself into something of a backwater: a distant
prospect perhaps, but one that might please those who emigrated from Bangkok
in search of peace and quiet.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (11): Conservation must replace
reactors - Christopher Brown-Humes on Sweden's dilemmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long cold winters, energy-intensive industries such as forestry, and a
general emphasis on the environment provide Sweden with plenty of incentives
to save energy.
However, the more immediate stimulus to the country's energy-saving drive
has come from a 1980 parliamentary decision to phase out nuclear power
completely by the year 2010. It is ambitious because Sweden's 12 reactors
supply nearly half of its electricity needs. If it is to be met,
conservation and enhanced efficiency will have a significant role to play,
as will alternative, environmentally-friendly sources of power.
The country's record on energy efficiency is relatively encouraging. Since
1970 total consumption has fallen from 375 terawatt hours (twh) to 368 twh
last year, thanks to lower usage by industry and households. Dependency on
imported oil has been sharply reduced.
However, electricity consumption has risen steadily over the period, as the
country has become more dependent on hydroelectric and nuclear power to
compensate for the reduced oil burn. Electricity use has risen by an average
of 3.6 per cent a year since 1970 to reach 138 twh last year.
In the last few years there has been a slowing in the rate at which
electricity demand has grown, thanks partly to the three-year long
recession, but estimates still suggest it will rise by around 1.5 per cent a
year between now and the year 2000.
This trend is worrying, given the ambition to phase out nuclear power. Hence
a target to cut electricity consumption by at least 10 twh by the year 2000
featured as one of the major components in the government's 1991 energy
bill. The bill also placed significant emphasis on promoting alternative
fuel sources such as biomass (for combined heat and power plants), wind and
solar power.
The bill included a SKr3.7bn allocation for the promotion of energy
efficiency through a programme which was initially designed to run for five
years but which has now been extended to mid-1998.
One of the biggest slices of the cake - SKr1bn - is intended to support
conservation, particularly through the procurement of more energy-efficient
technology. Much of the work in this area has been carried out by Nutek, a
government body within the Department of Industry and Commerce. Its task has
been to bring producers and consumers together to find ways of producing
equipment and materials which use less electricity and prevent heat loss.
This covers everything from fridges and freezers to windows and
high-frequency lights.
The programme claims considerable success in the sense that some
fridge/freezer models have been developed which are 40 per cent more
efficient, while windows have been produced which are 50 per cent more
effective in preventing heat loss. The problem has been that the recession
and a massive slump in building activity have delayed the rate at which the
new technology might otherwise have been installed.
The programmes have had a relatively modest impact so far, and results in
most cases have yet to be quantified.
But even assuming the conservation drive is successful, the question of how
the country is going to compensate for the loss of nuclear power, which last
year supplied 43 per cent of its electricity needs, remains largely
unanswered. This is the most important question in the whole debate: will
nuclear power be phased out as planned?
Many observers expect the 2010 deadline to slip. They believe that with
memories of Chernobyl fading, and the good safety record of Sweden's own
reactors, there is less pressure for a complete phase-out.
Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, has called the deadline 'artificial'. The
1991 government bill itself is vague on the subject saying only that 'the
juncture at which the phase-out ..can begin and the rate at which it can
proceed will hinge on the results of electricity conservation measures, the
supply of electricity from environmentally friendly power production and the
possibilities of maintaining internationally-competitive prices.'
One of the difficulties is that parliament has effectively limited Sweden's
ability to expand hydro-electric power generation, the country's most
important source of electricity, by saying it will not harness the four
remaining undammed rivers in the north.
Electricity from combined heat and power plants might be able to take up
part of the strain, although only 3.4 twh of electricity from this source
was generated in 1991. The government has set aside SKr1bn of its SKr3.7bn
allocation for energy efficiency support specifically to promote CHP
production based on bio-fuels, such as wood chips. This includes grants both
for new CHP facilities and the conversion of old ones.
The answer to the electricity crunch could also see greater co-operation
with Nordic neighbours in the more deregulated energy market now beginning
to emerge in the region. But it is too early to quantify the extent of such
collaboration.
Whatever happens, there are those who fear that the best Sweden's energy
efficiency programmes can hope to achieve is a delay in the need to build
new power plants. Current forecasts suggest there will, in any case, be no
need for new power capacity until around the year 2000.
Critics say that Sweden's energy conservation drive is being undermined by
low prices and a tax structure designed to keep export-dependent industry
internationally competitive. There should be no surprise about pricing,
given that supply has exceeded demand during the current recession. Taxes,
though, do seem to have been kept relatively low to favour industry. For
example, an energy tax on fuel and electricity consumption was scrapped for
industry as from the start of this year. Households are still required to
pay this tax, and the rate at which they pay tax on carbon dioxide emissions
is four times higher than that paid by industry.
Some worry that low energy costs are conserving Sweden's old industrial
culture based around forestry, mining and steel when the country should be
doing more to promote the development of high-technology businesses.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (7): A long way from Rio de
Janeiro - Europe's energy tax, flagship of its green policies, is on the
rocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Union's proposed carbon and energy tax, rightly or wrongly seen
as the flagship in Europe's environmental convoy, has run aground, and is
not about to be refloated.
The tax was originally due to have started this year at Dollars 3 per barrel
of oil equivalent, rising to Dollars 10 a barrel by the year 2000. It is
intended to help the EU meet its pledge to stabilise carbon dioxide
emissions at 1990 levels by the end of the century, under the Twelve's
commitment to the Rio de Janeiro Climate Change Convention. In 1990, the EU
emitted 2,738m tonnes of CO. Brussels projects that if nothing is done,
emissions will rise some 12-13 per cent by the end of the century.
The tax was designed to complement other measures to cut greenhouse gases,
principally the SAVE (Specific Actions for Vigorous Energy Efficiency)
programme and the energy conservation programmes of the individual member
states.
But an EU-wide energy tax is a radical departure, and the plan quickly
monopolised the energies and attention given not only to the EU's fight
against global warming, but a good deal of the rest of European
environmental policy too.
The EU was in the vanguard internationally when it made its emissions
stabilisation pledge three years ago. But it has now fallen well behind,
with the tax portion of the emissions strategy mired in controversy for the
past 18 months.
There remains a danger that the EU will not be able to ratify the Rio
Convention by the end of this year. And even if the Twelve do ratify, there
are doubts that they can deliver the projected CO cuts.
The SAVE programme, designed to deliver one third of the cuts through a new
range of standards to improve energy efficiency in buildings, vehicles and
appliances, has been emasculated. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the European
Association for the Conservation of Energy, says 'it looks doubtful if even
one quarter of that target will ever be met'.
The national reduction targets, circulated by the European Commission this
spring, look almost as dubious. Totted up, they indicate that total EU
emissions would not stabilise but rise by over 4 per cent, or some 110m
tonnes. But that is if these individual targets are met, and there is not
enough evidence to suggest that programmes have been put in place to ensure
they are.
Consequently, attention has increasingly focused on the energy tax, on which
the Twelve are divided.
A German-led coalition of six member states (which includes Denmark, the
Netherlands, Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium), insists the emissions target
cannot be reached without an EU-wide tax.
The four poorest member states (Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece) back
the principle but in practice want undertakings that introducing the tax
will not hold back their efforts to catch up with average levels of EU
development. Their energy consumption is below average EU efficiency, but
their relative backwardness at the same time means they emit less per
capita; they want the burden of the target shared out among the Twelve so
that in nominal terms they can emit more if they phase in the tax.
France also claims to back the tax in principle, but as the EU's largest
user of nuclear-generated electricity, takes the view that it would be
unfairly hamstrung by the application of the tax to what it regards as a
clean fuel which does not contribute to global warming. As currently
designed, the tax falls on all non-renewable sources of energy.
Lastly and most importantly, the UK, which in the year after the tax was
formally proposed in May 1992 had been deliberately ambiguous, has now come
out firmly against it. In a May 27 memorandum, Sir John Cope, the British
paymaster-general, definitively ruled out an EU tax, and invited 'those
member states who wished to do so to introduce a tax which is compatible
with the single market'.
This October, Mr Tim Yeo, the UK's junior environment minister, told
Britain's partners that 'we are not willing to accept (an energy tax)
imposed by the Community'. He acknowledged, however, that this was not the
end of the battle. 'This is an issue which is not going to go away.'
The Danish presidency of the EU, in the first half of this year, and the
current Belgian presidency, have strained hard to advance the proposal. But
since the EU has no taxation powers, unanimity is required, and Britain's
objection amounts to a veto. The UK maintains that its decision at the
budget to impose value added tax on domestic gas and electricity obviates
the need for an EU tax. In fact, this step merely brings the UK into line
with VAT on fuel among its partners. The furore in the UK over VAT on fuel
was certainly a disincentive to any further tax on energy, but as Mr Yeo's
words suggest, Britain objects to the very principle of the EU being able to
levy a tax, even if it is supposed to be fiscally neutral and applies in
what is clearly an area for pan-European co-operation.
The debate between Britain and its partners has frequently been acrimonious.
In June, Mr John Gummer, UK environment secretary, claimed he had defeated
an ambush intended to force Britain into accepting that a tax was a
precondition for ratifying Rio.
Although in April, energy and environment ministers from the 11 agreed on
the principle of a tax, this overstated the degree of real consensus. In
October, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, produced
detailed plans on 'burden-sharing', which would allow the poorest four
member states to phase in the tax. But he himself acknowledges that this
served to smoke out the extent of France's concerns, while not yet
convincing the four.
In the most recent twist, the Belgian presidency is pushing as a possible
alternative the harmonisation upwards of excise duties on fuel. The
Commission is looking at the idea, but is not prepared - at least yet - to
withdraw the tax proposal to make way for it.
Expectations now are that the Twelve will individually ratify Rio, and that
the fight for measures to comply with it will go on. Although the pro-tax
faction maintains that overall there will be no net new costs to industry
from the measure, most still feel they could lose competitive edge to their
partners if they introduce carbon/energy taxes unilaterally.
Greece takes over the EU presidency in January, bringing little expectation
that a way out of the emissions impasse can be attempted until Germany
succeeds it in the second half of next year.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (10): Light-footed heavyweights
 -David Lawson on industry's revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry was once the most obvious of Britain's energy wasters.
Born to plentiful coal, raised on subsidised electricity and fattened by
natural gas, it should have been almost impossible to tame. Yet it is the
only sector to cut demand - down a hefty 40 per cent since the 1973 oil
shock and 7 per cent since the recession started.
The figures were bound to shift as the economy veered away from heavy
production towards service, but much of the saving can be put down to
greater dedication towards cutting bills. This is understandable among users
where energy is an obvious - and expensive - part of the production process.
Glucose is a ubiquitous component for foods, drinks and drugs which requires
a lot of heat to generate steam for extraction from grain. Tunnel Refineries
in south-east London saved Pounds 1.5m a year through a series of
investments in electric mechanical vapour recompression systems which
recycle energy through heat pumps. Not content with this, the company called
in AHS Emstar, one of the country's biggest contract energy management
groups, to examine further options.
This led to a Pounds 10m contract to design, finance, install and operate a
new combined heat and power plant based on gas-turbine generators. The
investment will reduce energy bills by around 10 per cent or more than
Pounds 500,000 a year - a sweet solution to a sticky problem.
Careful planning and monitoring can reduce bills up to 30 per cent, says
Emstar. This can involve anything from replacement of inefficient systems to
juggling with the mix of fuels.
Hoover went all the way on its Merthyr Tydfil factory in South Wales. The
appliance manufacturer spent Pounds 1.3m on new equipment, switched from
coal and oil to gas and installed a computerised energy management system
remotely monitored down a phone line. This not only cut energy bills by
Pounds 750,000 a year but reduced CO emissions by more than 70 per cent,
says Emstar.
Cutting fuel bills has become more feasible since privatisation, with gas
and electricity companies willing to tear up tariff sheets in the battle for
business. Independent consultants flourish as power brokers but each
supplier also has an army of engineer-salesmen touting advice. Regional
electricity groups are even ranging into each others' territory to win
orders.
Suggestions sometimes involve cutting consumption of the very product they
are selling. The logic is that less leads to more; reducing energy cost per
unit will improve efficiency, which may raise overall production and end up
with the customer asking for more. It is better to have a satisfied customer
taking less power than one buying elsewhere.
Other factors such as the environment also get drawn into the equation.
Glass recycling is a popular subject as it takes this most enduring of
materials out of an overloaded waste disposal system and cuts down road
deliveries. United Glass at Harlow ships in sand from Surrey and Kent,
limestone from Derbyshire, plus essential soda ash and mineral additives for
new bottles and jars. Every tonne of old glass (cullet) saves the energy
equivalent of 30 gallons of oil, says British Glass, the pressure group
which co-ordinates the industry's recycling campaign. Total savings amounted
to more than 7m gallons at the last count in 1988 and will now be much
higher, as recycling is growing in leaps and bounds.
The government is aiming for 10,000 bottle banks and a 50:50 split between
new and old glass by the mid-1990s.
United cut energy consumption of its recycling furnace by 17.5 per cent and
raise output by a fifth by replacing oil burners with electricity power
elements. The Pounds 230,000 investment could be recouped in just over a
year. A lot of the work at the electricity industry's Capenhurst Research
Centre is centred around similar energy-saving schemes designed to
supplement efforts by users themselves.
Meanwhile, British Gas is also fighting the same corner. It has helped
Tioxide Europe, for instance, to switch part of a titanium dioxide pigment
processing plant at Grimsby from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to natural
gas. This will cut fuel bills by Pounds 1m a year and has environmental
spin-offs, such as improved working conditions and the elimination of 18
tanker deliveries a week.
Inco Alloys spent two years working with the British Gas Technical
Consultancy Service on upgrading to extrusion press facilities at its
Hereford plant. This involved building a special test furnace, which
eventually proved itself against an initial idea to use electrical induction
heating of metals. Energy costs have been cut by 50 per cent, saving more
than Pounds 80,000 a year.
Even the smallest reductions in consumption can help some users because they
are so energy-intensive. Ford's Dagenham plant needs 56 megawatts of
electricity - pretty much the requirements of a fair-sized town. Vauxhall
introduced a computerised energy management system which cut its
requirements at Luton by 6.5 per cent in three years to 29MW. The importance
of such customers keeps a supplier such as Eastern Electricity constantly on
its toes, helping to cut and trim.
Vehicles need half-a-dozen or more coats of rust-proofer and paint, and each
layer can cost up to Pounds 30 per car to dry, so even small savings are
significant on a line producing thousands each year. Meanwhile, new EU
emission rules are forcing changes away from solvent-based paints to
water-based glosses. So Eastern Electricity took a pro-active line, doing
its own research into technical and economic problems.
Not all these large customers are mainstream industrialists. British Gas
claims to have saved the RAF Pounds 800,000 a year through development of a
long-term energy management campaign on various bases while introduction of
combined heat and power units at Heathrow's cargo area and the 53-acre
University Hospital of Wales cut annual energy bills by Pounds 1.5m and
Pounds 350,000 respectively.
Little things can also mean a lot - such as making sure your quiches are
cooked properly. Farmer Giles Foods in Aylesbury was distraught that its
snacks were being rejected. Tilting oven racks tipped the fillings and left
unappetising burned goo along the sides. A modern electric conveyor oven
stabilised the substandard quiches, added 50 per cent to sales and doubled
output.
Food processors are like movie doctors and midwives: they need hot water,
and plenty of it, because people and plant need regular scouring. Farmer
Giles found a chilling solution to further energy saving with the help of a
little lateral thinking from Eastern Electricity. Refrigeration plant
normally ejects the heat into the atmosphere. Now the hot gases pass through
an exchanger inside water tanks, providing around 12,000 gallons for
hand-washing and plant cleaning. Initial savings were expected to be Pounds
13,000 a year - a payback of less than 12 months.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (8): The scourge of sloppiness -
Householders' heat costs are in their own hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A brief moment of importance comes out of the blue when the phone rings or a
clipboard-clutching figure darts out of a shop doorway. Could you contribute
your views on a vital issue? Of course, of course (looking earnest).
Are energy costs important in choosing a home? Certainly. Would you pay more
for an efficient home? Ermmm ... How efficient is your existing home? Have
you improved the insulation? Well ..Panic sets in. You begin making up
'right' answers before rushing off with some lame excuse about a pressing
appointment.
Energy-saving is the most politically correct of issues but principles are
often lost in a morass of muddled thinking and expediency. Ordinary homes
could make an enormous contribution as they produce more CO than cars or
factories and make up 30 per cent of the UK's fuel consumption.
But the figures keep rising. Homes soak up 17 per cent more energy than in
1973, when the oil-price shock brought in fuel-saving. Even the recession
has failed to stop this trend; consumption went up 3.75 per cent between
1988 and 1992, according to the Digest of UK Energy Statistics. This is
partly due to the growth in central heating and household appliances but
apathy is also a big factor. Most home buyers still put prices before
running costs, and existing owners turn up the heat rather than insulate the
attic.
One argument for imposing VAT on domestic fuel next year - though there are
serious doubts whether it will work - is that higher bills may change these
priorities. Annual energy bills for an average three-bed semi will rise by
Pounds 175 by 1995.
Housebuilders make great play that new homes will become even more
environmentally attractive. They average seven out of 10 on the National
Energy Foundation efficiency scale compared with a miserable national
average of four. Laing even managed a perfect 10 through extra measures such
as low-energy light bulbs.
The industry as a whole is not entirely convinced, however. Wimpey Homes is
a third of the way through building the company's first low-energy estate.
The 32 homes on the outskirts of Newcastle, are based on an idea developed
with the Building Research Energy Conservation Support Unit (Brecsu) in the
1980s and boast scores of more than nine on the NEF scale.
But building to this higher standard costs an extra Pounds 1 a sq ft,
according to Euan Cresswell, Wimpey's regional director, averaging around
Pounds 1,500 per home. Buyers will not pay this premium over traditional
homes. 'These measures will cut heating bills by 40 per cent but people
still appear to look at capital outlay rather than future revenue savings,'
he says.
Others are more optimistic. Admiral Homes says it has been overwhelmed by
demand for a simple energy-saving package which involves saving Pounds 2,500
by doing without a chimney and spending the money on extra insulation. That
required a leap of faith. 'We always thought an open fire was essential to
sell a family home,' says David Holliday, the chief executive. Now he knows
otherwise.
Brecsu is also convinced that extra costs should be marginal. It points that
housing associations, which lead the field in energy efficiency, figure on
as little as a couple of hundred pounds extra per home. But many builders
argue that this does not allow for extra overheads involved in one-off
designs and special materials. Some sites also demand compromises in the
siting and internal layout required for high energy scores. South-facing
homes, for instance, consume vastly less energy but you cannot follow this
rule when trying to cram in enough homes to make a highly priced site
viable.
Better energy efficiency will be led by improvements in building regulations
rather than market demand, insists Mr Cresswell. Latest revisions have
raised insulation standards by 20 per cent since 1990 and are due to step up
again by a similar amount by 1995. Every new home will also require an
energy rating, which should help raise awareness among buyers. The Newcastle
scheme is a test-run for building to these specifications.
But all this is a drop in the ocean of older property which consumes the
vast bulk of domestic fuel, as new homes make up a mere 1 per cent of the
country's stock. Owners have an easy solution to higher VAT bills at their
fingertips, says Megan Flack of the NEF. Draught-proofing and better
insulation would more than outweigh tax increases by cutting the running
costs of an average home to Pounds 660. Taking into account the extra VAT
burden, that produces a total saving of Pounds 400 a year.
A typical Nottingham semi on the Foundation's files required work worth
Pounds 2,300 to reduce annual energy costs from Pounds 1,248 to Pounds 756,
so it would take five years merely to break even. But 1,500 of this went on
a high-efficiency condensing boiler. There is plenty of scope for cheaper
jobs which have a significant impact on bills; insulating the cavity walls
for around Pounds 400, for instance, would pay for itself in two years. But
owners, just like new home buyers, have to be persuaded that it is worth
spending money today for savings and comfort tomorrow.
Ms Flack believes the ratings on new homes will put everything on to a level
playing field. Selling an old home will be difficult without an energy score
because buyers will want to know where they stand. Therefore owners will
have to fork out for insulation and an NEF inspection.
One hole gapes through that argument. Only a minority of buyers currently
bother with a structural inspection; if they are happy to risk the roof
falling in, it seems logical they will put up with draughts. In fact,
running costs hardly come into the equation. In spite of dutiful answers to
pollsters, overall price and location remain the major influence on buyers
and some of the most sought-after homes like country cottages would be lucky
to get on to the NEF score sheet.
For all its unpopularity, a tax on fuel appears a potent way of making
inroads into the Pounds 14bn bill run up by UK housing. The chancellor is
feeding back some of the tax income into higher benefits for pensioners and
disabled people, who often live in the least efficient housing. An extra
Pounds 100m will also go into grants under the home energy efficiency scheme
over the next three years. But campaigners would prefer more widescale
incentives towards insulation and super-efficient condensing boilers.
In the harsh world of political reality, however, cutting the public
spending deficit will take priority over raising housing standards to a
level enjoyed in other parts of Europe for more than 50 years.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (9): Scotland report shows need
for cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just under a quarter of Scotland's houses fall at the low end of the
national scale in efficient energy use. That is around 400,000 homes falling
well below the national average, writes Deborah Hargreaves.
'Something must be done to encourage these households to save energy - if
you just wait for a turnover in the housing stock, you'd wait 100 years,'
said Mr Jack Miller, director of AHS Emstar, the Contract Energy Management
group, which has completed a study on the Scottish energy scene.
The study, which was partly sponsored by the European Union, highlights the
need for the government to kick start energy efficiency projects if it wants
them to take off.
'A lot of companies take a very short term approach to energy efficiency: if
a project takes four to five years to pay for itself, many company
accountants are reluctant to go for it,' said Mr Miller.
The energy study stressed Scotland's wealth in natural resources which could
produce far more of its electricity from renewable energy, but the country
has lagged behind the rest of Europe.
The study lays out a series of action plans which could form the basis of an
energy policy for Scotland in coming years. In the household sector, it
recommends establishing a rating programme for homes that awards marks on
the basis of energy efficiency. This system should take into account the
Scottish climate.
In addition, the study called for a revision of Scottish building
regulations.
It highlighted a number of key energy efficiency projects such as saving
energy in public libraries. At the same time, the study also called for a
design for a wind farm. But at the heart of many of its recommendations is
the need for additional cash.
'Conservation still happens because of investment and if that investment is
not happening on its own, the government should try and make it happen,'
said Mr Miller.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (8): Not like the old days - Tourism
industry / facing a shift in fortunes / These are difficult times for many
Bangkok hoteliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The general manager of the venerable Oriental Hotel, Mr Kurt Wachtveitl,
sent his staff a private notice this summer warning them this was the worst
season of his 25 years at the hotel.
'Room rates are falling every week and the competition is getting fiercer
and fiercer,' he wrote.
Although the dapper Austrian's hotel is sometimes voted the best in the
world, he was forced to remind staff to treasure customers as never before
to prevent them sloping off to one of the Oriental's rivals.
'We simply cannot afford an unhappy client. Once clients know that our
business is down, they will become more demanding, seeking discounts,
wanting more service, pampering and better facilities.'
The Oriental, like all Bangkok hotels, has been hit by the global recession;
much sharper competition from regional rivals like Malaysia, Indonesia and
China; a rapid increase in the number of hotel rooms and, critically, by the
fact that Thailand has lost some of its appeal as a tourist destination.
Thailand's luck this year - a dramatic surge in Asian tourist arrivals  -
hardly compensates for plans laid during the days of high-spending
foreigners.
Mr Vinai Ruenjaruwatana, the head of Sunshine Tours and the chairman of the
Phuket chamber's tourism committee, said: 'Don't be fooled by all this
activity - that's only been achieved by cutting rates to the bone. We're
filling hotels with 'low quality' tourists who don't spend money and wreck
the rooms.'
This is a far cry from the late 1980s when - helped by a highly successful
'Visit Thailand Year' promotion in 1987 - hoteliers could give out rooms
like prizes. Mr Vichit na Ranong, owner-manger of the Pearl Village Resort
Hotel in Phuket and president of the Phuket Hotel Owners' Association,
remembers that in those days 'agents were so desperate to find accommodation
they said, 'just get me the rooms - we'll sort out the price later'.
Wonderful.'
The tourist industry in Thailand soared in the second half of the 1980s when
Thailand - helped by a longish stretch of political stability and the 1987
promotion - suddenly became a favoured exotic holiday destination. There
were double digit increases in annual tourist arrivals from 1986 to 1990,
with an almost 24 per cent jump in visitors in 1987 alone.
Although a record 5.3m arrivals were recorded in 1990 the dramatic growth
was already starting to tail off before the traumatic double blow of the
Gulf War and a military coup in 1991. Arrivals dropped by four per cent in
1991 and then rose a sluggish 0.97 per cent in 1992. Thailand's political
crisis reached a climax in May 1992 when troops gunned down pro-democracy
protesters on the streets of Bangkok.
A 16 per cent pick-up over the first seven months of this year prompts Mr
Bert van Walbeck, executive vice president of Bangkok tour operator Siam
Express, to say: 'Thailand could become for Asia what Spain became for
Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. In five or 10 years' time the office lady in
Shanghai will start taking holidays just as her equivalent in Stockholm did
20 or 30 years ago.'
Nearly 60 per cent of arrivals between January and July this year were from
east Asia, notably Taiwan and Korea. Chinese tourists rose a remarkable 231
per cent to 176,085 - only 5.35 per cent of the total. A pointer perhaps to
the future, but hardly a big boost to revenues this year.
With hindsight it was in the glory days of Thai tourism that the seeds of
the industry's current troubles were sown as eager entrepreneurs
over-developed Thai resorts, trying to turn Thailand into an amusement
arcade and thereby destroying the very qualities that attract visitors.
The fishing village of Pattaya on the east coast has in two decades been
turned into a huge brothel fronting onto a polluted sea - thanks partly to
the machinations of a local mafia.
Phuket island's virgin beaches and turquoise seas off southern Thailand's
west coast were the stuff of dreams - until a decade-and-a-half of feverish
hotel building encouraged international passenger jets to land at regular
intervals at the newly expanded airport.
The expression on the face of a local chemist who is also secretary-general
of the Phuket Environmental Protection Association, Mr Vinai Ruenjaruwatana,
would make a good illustration for the wry T-shirt slogan 'Another
(expletive deleted) Day in Paradise.'
'Phuket is skirting disaster. If I wasn't born here, I would move,' he says.
Myriad bars, cafes and guest houses proliferated in the shadow of Thailand's
big hotels as every man and his dog tried to take money from tourists.
When the merry-go-round stopped, Thailand found it had priced itself out of
the market for many European, north American and Japanese tourists. Yet many
investors are blithely continuing to build as if the last two years were a
minor hiccup, prompting the suspicion that many new hotels must count as
'vanity investments' constructed to enhance the owner's prestige rather than
merely to make money.
In Bangkok, the number of hotel rooms will grow by around 20 per cent in
1993 alone, helping to bring expected occupancy rates down from 53.22 per
cent in 1992 to an estimated 48.65 per cent in 1993, compared with 88 per
cent occupancy during the 1988 peak, according to Peregrine Brokerage.
Not every hotel owner is thinking of jumping from the panorama view deck:
tourists are increasingly avoiding Bangkok or Pattaya by flying directly
into such locations as the northern capital Chiang Mai and Phuket as the
rest of Thailand is 'discovered.'
Phuket occupancy rates were 38-59 per cent in 1992 when the number of rooms
increased by 16.4 per cent, yet the degradation of Phuket, and other
upcountry destinations, remains well behind Bangkok or Pattaya. There was a
106 per cent jump in arrivals in 1992 when 1.2m people visited the island
and stayed for, an unusually long average of 10.89 days.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (6): Victim of the nation's success -
Bangkok struggles with severe infrastructure problems / 'Bangkok's traffic
congestion and pollution are just about the worst in the world - ever. Never
in history have people had to live in the conditions we endure each day.' -
Bangkok Post, November 18, 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bangkok residents are obsessed with the city's traffic problems. The visitor
is regaled with a grim menu of facts and figures - pollution levels in the
city are twice the acceptable level and are officially classified as
'dangerous.' The city, along with its roads, is sinking.
Each day about 500 new cars and 450 motorbikes join the traffic on the
city's gridlocked streets. In most cities about 25 per cent of the land area
is devoted to roads. In Bangkok it's only about eight per cent.
During the great Bangkok traffic jam in July last year - after a heavy
rainstorm - some schoolchildren were stuck in traffic for most of the night
while a trip from the airport to central Bangkok, a distance of under 20kms,
took five and a half hours.
Despite the chaos, life in Bangkok goes on - just. People have adapted. To
avoid peak hour traffic, children arrive at school at 6am for an 8am start.
Secretaries go to work sitting side saddle on the backs of taxi motorbikes.
Every business person has a mobile phone - some, a mobile office.
Over-centralisation is the main cause of Bangkok's problems. More than
two-thirds of Thailand's urban population lives in Bangkok.
Political power rests in the capital. Bangkok is also Thailand's economic
powerhouse: economists calculate that the city and its environs account for
up to two thirds of the country's GDP.
'Bangkok is the victim of Thailand's success' says Mr David Hendrix, General
Manager of Citibank, Thailand. 'The Thai economy has been growing at about 8
per cent each year. In Bangkok that translates to about 14 per cent - that's
too much for anywhere to handle.'
Bureaucratic inertia has been another factor contributing to Bangkok's woes.
Mass transit systems have been talked about for more than 20 years. At
present at least three projects are on the drawing board. Apart from some
rather desultory piling work on one scheme, no work is going on.
A maze of overlapping and rival authorities governs Bangkok - 'it's like
driving a bus with 16 hands on the wheel,' says one official.
Then there's been the dark hand of politics. Governments in Thailand have
come and gone. Each has had its own agenda for solving Bangkok's problems.
Deals have been made, then rewritten by a successor administration, then
abandoned.
Along the way, various politicians are reported to have made substantial
amounts from contract awards.
In the late 1980s the government decided to go ahead with two expressway
projects in Bangkok on a build, operate, transfer, basis. The expressways
are Thailand's first venture into BOT projects: both deals have run into
serious problems.
The Bangkok Expressway Co (BECL), a consortium 65 per cent controlled by
Kumagai Gumi of Japan, entered into an agreement to build and operate a 20km
stretch of expressway, plus an additional 12km to be merged with an existing
network.
The first Dollars 800m phase of the project was completed in March 1993. But
from then till the beginning of September, the expressway lay empty - used
only by joggers and cyclists.
BECL and various government agencies had become involved in increasingly
acrimonious disputes about toll charges, about who should operate the
expressway, about the government's failure to deliver land necessary for the
project on time - which resulted in big losses for BECL.
When government efforts to persuade BECL to open the expressway failed, the
authorities, armed with a court order, opened the road themselves. Motorists
flooded onto the expressway, promptly causing yet another traffic jam.
BECL, and Kumagai Gumi in particular, accuse the authorities of breaking
virtually every contractual rule in the book.
'Either they don't understand BOT or they hate the whole idea,' says Mr
Takao Ninomiya, BECL's managing director.
For their part the authorities say BECL has misinterpreted the terms of the
original contract. A stand-off has developed. The end-result is likely to be
either a law suit between the various parties, or a forced buy out of BECL
by local banks, supported by the government.
Don Muang Tollway, stretching out towards the airport north of Bangkok, is
another problem project, also BOT.
One administration said funding for the Dollars 450m project could all be
raised in Thailand. A successor administration said half the funding had to
be raised offshore: that held up the project for several months.
The project's planning seemed to be seriously at fault. The government
refused permission to demolish existing flyovers which were in the way of
the expressway's construction. Because of traffic problems, contractors are
only allowed to carry out large scale work between midnight and 5am.
The Don Muang Tollway is already well over budget and more than a year
behind schedule. To add to the problems of both projects, the banks,
frightened by the problems encountered, have curtailed their lending.
Questions have been raised as to whether investors, particularly foreigners,
will now be willing to become involved in similar BOT schemes, given the
painful history of these two projects.
But it is not all gloom and doom. Bangkok's problems have overshadowed the
large scale infrastructure projects that have been successfully completed in
other parts of the country. Other capital cities in the region, such as
Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Manila, are facing similar, if not quite such
critical, problems.
The new Thai government has pledged to tackle, once and for all, the traffic
congestion that is choking Bangkok to death. But residents, who show
remarkable stoicism in the face of the deteriorating conditions in the city,
are sceptical.
'Even if they started building a mass transit system now, the work would
bring Bangkok to a standstill,' says one long-time resident. 'In the end,
we'll just have to lock up, throw away the keys and move somewhere else.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (7): High profits for Thai banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare for commercial banks to be allowed to make such consistently high
profits as Thailand's: the top six banks could triple their combined profits
between 1990 and 1994.
The conservative central bank, the Bank of Thailand, waged a short but
surprisingly sharp and public campaign with the 15 listed banks earlier this
year over their stunning profits, with central bankers even quoted in the
Thai press as accusing the commercial banks of 'ripping off' their
customers.
Most Thai banks started life either as the financing arms of Sino-Thai
business empires or to cater for an institution like the military, as in the
case of the Thai Military Bank.
Complacent managements preferred to deal with loyal corporate or trade
customers rather than trim rates and fight for market share - an attitude
which had developed by the 1990s into a highly successful quasi-cartel.
The Bank of Thailand has particularly disliked the widening spread between
deposit and lending rates, which appeared to hit smaller, non-prime
borrowers disproportionately hard.
The average spread between all earning assets of the top six banks and all
deposits widened from 3.07 per cent in 1991 to 4.74 per cent in the second
quarter of 1993, twice what most western bankers would feel lucky to get
away with.
Unfortunately for the Bank of Thailand its influence over politically
well-connected banks is of only limited effectiveness because, in the name
of deregulation, it has deprived itself of the usual mechanisms used by
central banks to control interest rates. Mr Graham Catterwell, country
representative of Crosby Research calls it 'deregulation without
competition."
The global interest rate decline has relieved some of the pressure on
borrowers, but the banks have generally maintained the wide spreads between
deposit and lending rates.
If earnings growth does slow over the next few years, as many stock market
analysts predict, Thailand's 15 listed commercial banks are likely to remain
hugely profitable for the foreseeable future.
For all its avowed determination to make its banks more competitive the Bank
of Thailand has yet to expose local commercial banks (whose retail
operations are notoriously inefficient) to real competition from
international banks.
Most foreign banks are only allowed one branch. This is likely to change in
time, as the much trumpeted opening of the offshore banking system known as
Bangkok International Banking Facility this year suggests, but not before
Thai banks have had time to hone their competitive skills.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (6): A question of breeding -
Case study / temperature control in Mr Lambkin's piggery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Lambkin, who manages a farm for Farmers' Weekly magazine, was
shocked to see how much energy he was losing from his pig breeding section
where 3,000 animals are kept, writes Deborah Hargreaves.
After an energy audit from experts at Adas, the government's farm advisory
service, he was surprised to see the savings that could be made by
introducing some straightforward improvements.
'Basically, they gave us a kick and said: you look at this every day and
look at what you're missing. We hadn't appreciated how much energy was
disappearing and how much that costs - when they did that sum, it made us
wince,' Mr Lambkin said.
Agriculture accounts for 5 per cent of the nation's annual energy
consumption, but Adas believes that with a mix of education and advice,
farmers can make significant savings as well as improving their
environmental credentials.
Two years ago, at the behest of the Department of Agriculture, the
organisation launched a programme to educate farmers about energy
conservation.
This involved running a promotional and advertising campaign in the press as
well as providing free farm visits where experts can offer advice on
managing energy consumption.
Mr Gareth Ellis, who runs the programme, said a team of advisers made 200
visits last year and are scheduled to see another 400 farms this year.
Fuel bills can account for 20-30 per cent of total input costs on intensive
livestock farms, horticultural holdings and for dairy producers and
therefore these farmers are more interested in energy saving. But even a
general farmer can end up paying 5-10 per cent of his total costs on power.
'We're offering a common sense approach to the farmer to point out some of
the areas he needs to pay more attention to,' said Mr Ellis. 'It's not
exciting, but it often helps to have another pair of eyes look at your
energy use.'
Adas advisers are looking for obvious failings such as lack of insulation,
poor controls on heating units as well as efficiency of record keeping to
see if the farmer really knows where his fuel is being used. They rank the
farmers on the basis of their energy management: whether they are poor, good
or above average.
'We kicked ourselves for not noticing some of these things before,' said Mr
Lambkin who spends about Pounds 2,000 a month on electricity for heating his
pig units.
In other forms of intensive livestock production where chickens are kept
indoors, farmers can be paying as much as Pounds 20,000 a year in heating
costs for a unit containing 100,000 birds. Similarly a sow pig unit with 200
animals in it could cost Pounds 7,000 a year in fuel.
Adas reckons farmers can save 10 to 20 per cent of their costs in these
areas by cutting artificial lighting and using energy efficient lighting
where possible, ensuring insulation is good and that heating units are
regularly serviced and checked. An incorrect temperature setting of 1 degree
C can increase energy use by 15 per cent.
Mr Lambkin could save around Pounds 3,000 a year by modifying areas where
young piglets are kept, Adas reported. The farmer is busy implementing all
the recommendations made for insulating so-called 'forward creep' areas
where young pigs may move to be comfortable away from their mothers. These
are heated by infra-red lamps and Adas suggested cutting the wattage on
these bulbs.
However, other recommendations such as reducing the ventilation in the pig
units have not been taken up as Mr Lambkin fears the risk of creating an
unhealthy environment for the pigs.
Another saving stressed by Adas is the use of off-peak electricity, for
example, for feed processing or heating water in a dairy parlour.
Crop drying and storage on arable farms is extremely energy intensive, but
Adas advisers believe savings of up to 50 per cent are possible if energy
efficient techniques and good management are used.
Crops dry much more quickly in early autumn than later in the winter and
farmers can make big savings by drying early. 'You can save a lot by good
harvest management and getting your crops in early before dews are heavy and
the moisture content is higher,' said Mr Roy Gabain who runs a 3,300-acre
arable farm near Newmarket.
He has also cut down on tractor use after recommendations from Adas showed
he could save almost a third of his fuel costs. He does this mainly by using
a lighter cultivator on fields for one to two years in a three-year rotation
rather than a heavier plough which uses more fuel.
Mr Gabain also stresses the importance of maintenance of farm machines and
making sure that staff are adequately trained to use the vehicles properly.
In addition, certain makes of tractor are more fuel-efficient than others.
British farmers face an uncertain financial future as the effects of Common
Agricultural Policy reform are felt and if subsidies are cut further as a
result of a Gatt deal. This will make them even more cost-conscious and more
anxious to trim fuel bills by adopting energy-efficient measures.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (5): Backbenchers turn up the
heat - Politicians describe British energy policy as too narrow and
inadequately funded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK was one of the most complacent nations in the world when it comes to
energy efficiency - 'and that runs from the top to the bottom,' said Mr
Robert Jones, a Conservative MP and the chairman of the influential House of
Commons environment select committee. Mr Jones was launching a highly
critical report on the government's approach to energy efficiency.
The committee report blasted government conservation initiatives as being
'neither a sufficiently comprehensive nor an adequately funded programme of
action'. It is unlikely to be swayed by Mr Kenneth Clarke's move in the
Budget to increase funds available to p+ensioners for energy saving
measures.
The UK government has set a target for arresting the growth in its carbon
emissions and even reducing them from 170m tonnes in 1991 to 160m tonnes by
the end of the decade. Around half of this target is due to be met by energy
efficiency.
But the select committee was very sceptical that these targets could be
achieved. In addition, the committee called on the government to establish a
rolling programme of emission reduction targets beyond 2000 since carbon
outflows are expected to increase significantly at the end of the decade.
Government should also lead by example, the committee stressed. It
criticised the government for having few clear targets on cutting energy use
by its own departments - Whitehall's energy consumption actually rose last
year.
One of the key problems highlighted by the committee's report is the lack of
funding available for some government plans such as the Energy Saving Trust
which has been set a target of cutting out 2.5m tonnes of carbon emitted by
2000. The trust told the committee it would need Pounds 1.5bn to meet its
objectives, but this year it is expected to spend Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m.
In the year since it was set up, the trust has initiated four programmes for
saving energy including offering grants to households for the installation
of gas condensing boilers and setting up energy advice centres, but these
have so far been fairly minor measures.
Funding has come so far from British Gas and the electricity companies which
are allowed to pass it through to consumers on their bills.
Mr Colin Myerscough, director of the government's energy efficiency office,
says a big contribution should come from further changes in the electricity
pricing formula. He is predicting a spend of Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m for
the trust by the end of the decade. But this depends on whether gas and
electricity regulators go along with the idea - the MPs pointed out that
valuable time was being spent by trust officials negotiating funding with
the gas and electricity regulators.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, acknowledged that the trust's targets were
'extremely challenging,' and that it would only be able to achieve them with
support from regulators and utilities.
Another critique of financing plans for the trust rests on the part played
by consumers. Households are likely to be put off investing in making their
homes energy efficient in order to save money on fuel bills when they have
to pay a general levy for energy efficiency.
Mr Myerscough admits there will be a period in the mid-1990s when consumers
are paying around 1 to 2 per cent more for their fuel because of energy
efficiency provisions. 'That's pretty rough, but after that, benefits will
start to kick in,' he claims. If the trust achieves savings of 2.5m tonnes
of carbon as planned, that represents Pounds 1bn off household energy bills.
However, there is little public enthusiasm over the Government's decision to
levy Value Added Tax on energy bills. Although the energy efficiency office
believes the imposition of VAT will encourage conservation, Mr Myerscough
says the public concern over it 'highlights the difficulties of using the
price mechanism to control energy demand'.
The select committee has called on the government to come up with a
comprehensive programme to improve energy efficiency for low income
households to counteract the effects of higher bills.
While the trust has focused its attention solely on energy use by households
and small businesses, MPs on the select committee want to see its influence
spread to the industrial and transport sectors, where great savings could be
made.
The energy efficiency office has so far spearheaded the government's
approach to industrial savings with various initiatives to encourage
business leaders to express a commitment to conservation.
One initiative, which the office has dubbed 'Getting energy efficiency out
of the boiler room into the board room,' encourages senior company officials
to nail their colours to the mast of conservation.
'This gets top managers thinking about energy efficiency and giving their
personal commitment to it,' says Mr Myerscough.
He has already signed up more than 1,600 organisations including some
notable corporate heavyweights such as Sainsbury, British Sugar, Marks and
Spencer, Wellcome and IBM to the programme.
The government also expects to spend Pounds 1.7m this year on offering
energy management advice to small businesses.
So far, the office has had applications from more than 1,000 companies.
One of the most important planks of the government's energy efficiency
policy is a planned increase in the amount of electricity to be produced by
Combined Heat and Power schemes from a current 4,000 MegaWatts to 5,000 MW.
In short, although the government has some ambitious plans for combatting
global warming with energy efficiency measures, funding appears to fall far
short of what is required.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (5): Fresh opportunities for expansion -
Thai company profile / Christiani &amp; Nielsen (CNT) / The engineering group is
intent on extending its operations in the world's fastest-growing economic
region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christiani &amp; Nielsen was until recently one of Denmark's most well
established construction and engineering groups. Now it is Thai.
Late last year, the group's Thai subsidiary made a reverse takeover of its
Danish parent. The company, referred to as CNT and listed on the Bangkok
stock exchange since 1991, now bills itself as the only Thai-owned
international engineering concern.
'The takeover was the natural outcome of what was happening on the ground,'
says Mr John Millard, the group's chief executive. 'The parent company was
very Euro-focused, yet this part of the world is where the action is . . .
we felt frustrated that many opportunities in this region were not being
taken up.'
While the European parent encountered a series of problems, including
large-scale losses in South America due to currency devaluations, business
was expanding rapidly in Thailand.
Mr Millard says about two thirds of group revenues now come from the Asia
region. Turnover has risen from Bt300m in 1988 to a projected Bt6bn this
year. CNT now employs about 5,000 people: 4,500 of them are in Thailand.
CNT has been active in Thailand for many years. Among other projects, it
built the Democracy Monument in Bangkok - one of the nation's political
focal points over the years - and it developed the country's main port at
Klong Toey near Bangkok.
Latest projects include a Bt2.45bn shopping centre near Bangkok and possible
involvement in an elevated rail system in the capital.
'If we'd stayed in our original home base, the market would have been
limited and the competition intense,' says Mr Millard. 'But with our HQ here
we can call on our European technical skills and use them in a more flexible
way to search out opportunities around the region. We will probably also
start looking at South America again in the near future.'
Some analysts are concerned that CNT might try to expand too fast and not
complete what is considered to be a much-needed overhaul of its loss-making
European businesses. There are also worries about CNT's exposure to the
highly volatile property sector in Thailand.
But the group is intent on expanding its operations in the world's
fastest-growing economic region. Recently it has become involved in a
Dollars 200m joint venture project in northern China. Last month, CNT was
awarded a MDollars 162m (Dollars 63m) contract to expand the port at Klang,
near Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (2): In pursuit of 'even' growth - The
economy, expansion continues unabated / Thailand has shrugged off the gloom
in its main export markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Thais talked about a 'slowdown' last year, they meant that real
economic growth had dipped to just over seven per cent annually. Now they
are talking about a 'recovery'.
Like other fast-growing economies in south-east Asia, Thailand has shrugged
off the gloom in its main export markets, a gloom particularly evident in
Europe and Japan.
Total Thai export growth will slow to an estimated nine or ten per cent this
year - compared to the official forecast of 15 per cent - but that is a
result of lower agricultural commodity prices; exports of electronic goods
and other manufactured products are still rising strongly.
Economic growth has in any case been driven largely by increasing domestic
activity and consumption. Government agencies are predicting real gross
domestic product growth of at least 7.5 per cent this year (compared to 7.3
per cent in 1992), rising to nearly eight per cent next year.
'The domestic economy has been the engine of this year's growth,' says Mr
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, in an interview. 'As GDP per
capita rises above a certain level, you begin to have synergy and dynamism
in the internal market.'
Mr Tarrin is anxious to see the Uruguay round of world trade talks
successfully concluded by the end of this year to ensure relatively open
markets for Thailand's exports, but he has few reasons to be worried about
the overall state of the domestic economy.
Thailand enjoys a perennial budget surplus (although Mr Tarrin points out
that the Thai budget does not include the operations of large state
enterprises which use deficit-financing), while low food and crude oil
prices have kept inflation remarkably subdued during a period of such high
growth. By the end of the year, inflation should be between 3.6 and 3.7 per
cent, Mr Tarrin says.
Thai concerns about falling investment over the past two years, and about
the competition for investment funds from other booming Asian economies such
as China and Vietnam, have been allayed by a recent sharp rise in
applications to the Board of Investment (BOI).
Project applications were worth Bt524.74bn in 1990, falling to Bt281.99bn in
1991 and Bt213.07bn in 1992. But since the second quarter of this year, the
sheaf of applications at the BOI's headquarters in Bangkok has growth more
thick month by month, and the value of applications reached Bt201.96bn in
the nine months to September.
Japanese companies are among the most active investors. The strength of the
yen, and the attractiveness of the Thai domestic market with its 70m
inhabitants, has prompted Japanese multinationals such as Toyota to expand
existing operations; smaller Japanese concerns - component manufacturers,
for example - are also seeking cheaper locations away from their home base.
One Japanese bank in Bangkok is said to be dealing with more than 70
Japanese companies investigating opportunities in Thailand.
Bankers say that rising foreign direct investment, and a burst of portfolio
investment into the stock exchange, have helped to produce a surge of
liquidity in the Thai economy since the third quarter, forcing down interest
rates.
The trend towards lower rates has been accentuated by the current vogue for
listed Thai companies to raise money through issuing 'Euroconvertible'
debentures denominated in US dollars.
The Thai financial authorities, ever watchful of inflation and concerned
about the low savings rate (private saving was 21 per cent of GDP in 1992),
are ready to push up interest rates next year if necessary. In the meantime,
the government is planning a number of economic reforms to improve the
international competitiveness both of Thai industry and of the financial
sector, a process accelerated by US demands for more access to the services
business in developing countries.
'Industrialisation will not hold the total key to our future,' says Mr
Tarrin, the former president of Siam Commercial Bank. 'Trade and finance and
the service sectors will play a very important role.'
Banking, hitherto dominated by the 15 listed Thai commercial banks, will be
gradually liberalised, partly by allowing offshore banking licence holders
under the new Bangkok International Banking Facility to increase the scope
of their activities.
For the industrial sector, the government is proffering both a carrot and a
stick. Import tariffs for raw materials are to be lowered, but there will
also be gradual reductions in tariffs for finished and semi-finished goods
in the years ahead.
'What you will see in the longer term - say three years from now - is a much
freer market, much more vibrant imports,' says Mr Tarrin. 'Yet you'll begin
to see more investments taking advantage of this and turning it around to
exports.'
Another government priority is to narrow the gap between rich and poor, a
field in which Thailand has been notably less successful than its south-east
Asian neighbours; wealth is concentrated in Bangkok and on the nearby
eastern seaboard, and hundreds of thousands of people from poor farming
families in the north-east migrate to the capital to find work as factory
workers, domestic servants or prostitutes.
'We have a situation where 60 per cent of the population is engaged in
agriculture, but agriculture produces maybe 13 to 14 per cent of our GDP
now. That tells you right away that our income gap is huge,' says Mr Tarrin.
The centralisation of industry and commerce around Bangkok has also caused
problems for businesses and residents in the form of traffic congestion and
pollution.
But the announcement in April of enhanced BOI incentives for investors in
'zone three' areas away from Bangkok and its environs (zones one and two)
appears to be bearing fruit.
According to Mr Staporn Kavitanon, BOI secretary general, 60 per cent of the
applications from potential investors received in the first 10 months of
this year indicated an intention to locate factories in zone three - 'we are
encouraging the relocation of existing industry in zones one and two,' he
says.
Rapid economic growth in Thailand seems likely to continue unabated, but the
government wants to avoid the mistakes of its predecessors and ensure that
wealth and jobs are spread throughout the country.
'We will not pursue a high growth policy, says Mr Tarrin. 'We will pursue an
even growth policy.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (3): Watchdog to the rescue - Reforms
continue on the Thai stock market / Thailand's stock market now has more
appeal for hard-headed realists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ekamol Kiriwat, the forceful head of Thailand's 18-month-old Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), finds a robust good humour useful - 'recently
I tried to explain what 'disclosure' means to some big players. They
obviously thought I was quite mad]' he says with relish.
Yet the bark of Mr Ekamol's 18-month-old watchdog has clearly helped foreign
and institutional investors concentrate more on underlying value than on the
insider knowledge and share-ramping that used to be the driving force in
share trading.
At the beginning of the 1990s a consensus emerged among government
regulators, including the Bank of Thailand (the central bank), and
institutional investors that the Thai stock market's traditional shenanigans
could no longer be tolerated. It was agreed the market needed to be less fun
for privileged insiders and more appealing to hard-headed realists, both at
home and abroad.
Mr Ekamol likes to point out that in a country with a chronic capital
shortage, 'it's a privilege for anyone to get capital, to get scarce money.
That's why I want to be very straight on the stock market and the debt
market - I believe in real finance.'
After enduring predictable 'paper tiger' jibes, the SEC pounced on three
groups of alleged share manipulators in late 1992 and early 1993. Although
there is no sign that anyone will be convicted soon, the move quickly
deflated a speculative market to the horror of many individual investors.
A tentative revival of optimism towards the middle of the year was squashed
by unexpectedly bad second quarter corporate earnings. But, buoyed by
continued strong economic growth, investors regained their nerve as the
second half of the year progressed. Towards the end of September, the
momentum suddenly gathered pace as foreign institutions, some of whom had
never given Thailand a second look, started buying Asia and the Stock
Exchange of Thailand index proceeded to romp through all previous records.
From the beginning of October to mid-November, the SET index surged by 38
per cent, easily outstripping rival markets in the region during the period
despite having the worst expected earnings growth figures for 1993 (4 per
cent - or minus 10 per cent excluding the profitable banking sector -
compared with Singapore's 14 per cent and Hong Kong's 19 per cent earnings
growth).
Mr Peter Emblin, the investment vice-president of local fund managers
One-Investment Management, said: 'Prices have been driven by falling
interest rates so far. I think the market's now waiting to see if corporate
earnings can pick up as we go into 1994 after which there could be a second
lift to prices.'
SBCI's director of South-East Asia Research, Mr Edward Lamond, believes
Thailand's stock market is at about the same stage of development as
Hongkong was in the early 1970s - when some price-earnings ratios spiked at
90 before collapsing to 20.
During November the average p/e for the Thai market was in the low 20s, but
Mr Lamond says ratios could rise to 40 or 50 before subsiding suddenly.
'P/es may have been trying to move way out in 1991 before they were cut back
by Saddam Hussein. This (rise and crash) is a very chastening experience for
a developing economy,' he warned.
Institutional investor appetite for Thai shares notwithstanding, there
remains a dearth of large, cleanly-run companies in which to invest. When
pressed to name 'good value' companies, analysts are wont to bring up names
such as The Pizza Company, holder of the Pizza Hut franchise: a good 'buy'
no doubt, but with hardly enough share capital to satisfy foreign fund
managers.
International investors tend to shy away from some of the big counters that
do exist such as Bangkok Land and the local flagship of the sprawling
Chearavanont family empire, CP Feedmill, whose relatively opaque managements
make analysts suspicious. Even newly-privatised Thai Airways International's
forecasts have been far too optimistic.
There are, however, plenty of large companies coming to the market for
finance. Foreigners over-subscribed 17 times for the tranche of TelecomAsia
alloted to them, and the shares should start trading mid-December.
Although part of the CP empire - and perhaps overpriced - TelecomAsia is in
a potentially lucrative sector and holds a concession to install two million
desperately needed telephones in Bangkok.
Also arriving soon - and providing a change from the old staples of the
Bangkok market such as banks, cement companies and property developers - are
telecommunications companies Loxley and UCOM, a soon-to-be-privatised
subsidiary of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, and National
Petrochemical Corp.
The biggest technical issue still facing foreign investors are the limits
placed on foreign ownership of listed companies. Officials' ideas for
circumventing these legally - by so-called Mexican trusts, for example -
have yet to bear fruit.
But there is still plenty of local money waiting to get into the market when
the time is right. Mr Rob Collins, research director of Asia Equity, says
newly-established local mutual funds have raised Bt35bn which has yet to be
placed.
Some admire the Thai market because it is not as highly regulated as
Singapore and has liquidity that puts it ahead of Taiwan and South Korea,
but critics say the SEC has only scratched the surface of the wrongdoing
that continues to undermine the SET.
The head of one foreign broking house in Bangkok said: 'The SEC has stopped
the utterly outrageous things like the huge share ramps, and the relentless
churning that went on. But a lot of monkey business goes on which will have
to be dealt with soon.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (4): Over-sophistication can be
a headache - Commercial buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shiny new building was quiet and cold. 'I'll get some tea to warm you
up,' said the chief executive. That was cold too. He could not raise the
heating: 'Sorry. The computer controls all that.' The remote brain also kept
lights blazing on the deserted floor because scanners detected us sitting in
the corner. The electricity bill must have been frightening.
Ten minutes later - probably around the time the lights automatically winked
out - in a cosy basement office sipping hot tea before a pulsating fan
heater, the building services manager quoted a figure resembling the debt of
a small South American nation. He also listed the reasons.
The air-conditioning was too powerful and the lighting controls too
inflexible. He had secretly turned down the heating and wanted to do
something more radical but could not convince the board.
These two executives - happy to talk if guaranteed anonymity - reveal
deep-seated problems now coming under serious attack. Firstly, it is not
just old and draughty premises that have swollen the total energy bill for
buildings to more than Pounds 20bn a year. Perhaps more disturbing, there is
plenty of expertise to cut these costs by as much as half but the message
often does not reach decision-makers.
A generation of new office blocks were seriously over-specified in the rush
to cater for new technology, particularly in central London.
Air-conditioning constitutes as much as a fifth of running costs, so it must
run efficiently. Yet designers created systems with as much as five times
the capacity required, according to Mr Peter Hill of the Building Research
Energy Conservation Support Unit (Brecsu).
'So often in the past, true heat gain from office equipment has not been
calculated,' he says in a study presented to CLIMA 2000, the international
energy and environment convention held in London this month. A study of
computers, printers and copiers found some create as little as a tenth of
the energy output rated by manufacturers. And that is when they are switched
on. More than 10 per cent of engineers, for instance, never touch a terminal
and a third are only intermittent users, so calculating heat per head of
staff can be wildly inaccurate.
Lower building specifications are now being proposed but with so little
development taking place, progress is hard to assess. Change could be
enforced from above within a couple of years as consultation drafts for the
next round of building regulations show heavy bias against air-conditioning.
This caused a small earthquake in the property industry, however, leading to
a second round of talks.
Critics insist that some occupiers demand air-conditioning, particularly
among the fumes and pollution of cities like London, and without them,
certain buildings would not be viable investments because the rents would be
too low.
'The overriding problem is educating developers and occupiers,' says Mr
David Lush, president of the Chartered Institution of Building Service
Engineers. He believes energy-saving will not become a major force until
tenants routinely ask how much a building costs to run. At the moment that
does not happen, according to Mr Peter Mantle of property consultants Jones
Lang Wootton. They bundle this up with overall occupation costs.
A standard for measuring efficiency posted as a label on each building would
nudge potential tenants in the right direction, says Mr Lush. The CIBSE is
now working out a system for inclusion in the regulations, although this
might not be effective until the end of the decade.
Meanwhile, the Building Research Establishment is making the running,
claiming to have covered around a quarter of new office buildings since 1990
with its Environmental Assessment Method (Breeam). This goes beyond
energy-efficiency, including factors such as pollution and recycled
materials and was extended to cover new industrial units this month. It
could attack the fundamental problem that construction and the production
and transport of materials consumes almost as much energy as a building will
use in its lifetime.
Doxford International business park on Tyneside was the first scheme awarded
the more stringent Breeam certificate earlier this year and is 90 per cent
let within six months of completion. Mr Trevor Silver of Akeler Holdings,
the developer, says that while high ratings might not clinch deals, with so
much space on the market they block them.
Investors also realise that 'greenness' will have a significant impact on
property values by the end of the decade, so they must prepare the way now.
Legal &amp; General, one of the country's top landlords, has been operating
along these lines for the last couple of years.
Existing buildings provide the biggest challenge. Anthony Beattie of Jones
Lang Wootton, one of the specialists making Breeam inspections, says many
companies have put such considerations on the back-burner during the
recession but tenants are gradually pressing landlords to identify
energy-saving improvements. 'Meanwhile, a vast amount of second-hand space
is virtually unlettable unless refurbished,' says Mr Beattie. 'That would be
the ideal time to raise energy-efficiency. In fact, it will probably be
essential.'
Some large owner-occupiers are already taking stock. Mr David Hatch, adviser
to the BBC, gave a commitment at this year's relaunch of Breeam that all the
corporation's major buildings would be assessed. London Transport has made a
similar pledge.
This will not demand the sort of wizardry often put forward for futuristic
new energy-saving buildings, however. 'The technology has been there all the
time,' says Mr Ted Nicklin. His firm of architects and engineers, Ryder
Nicklin, transformed the Vickers tank plant in Newcastle more than 10 years
ago, installing draught-proofing, integrated energy controls and low-energy
lighting. It cost Pounds 6m but cut bills to Pounds 70,000 a year, a tenth
of their former level.
'The company was ahead of its time,' he says. 'We could talk the same
language. Many boards seem proud to boast ignorance about such matters.'
Not for much longer, according to Mr Bil Musannif of Brecsu. Working on
behalf of the government's Energy Efficiency Office, his team has persuaded
1,500 top companies to commit themselves to re-education, so energy matters
are incorporated in board decisions. Meanwhile, technicians are being given
language lessons.
'Businesses often have experts who know what should be done but they cannot
talk to their own managers. Boards talk strategy, not widgets. We are
teaching them to communicate.' One essential tool is an energy management
guide published this year, which acts as a combined dictionary to the
vocabulary of company organisation, and a guidebook to management
structures.
Perhaps my managing director should sit down with his own expert for some
joint reading. Then perhaps he will at least be able to get a hot cup of
tea.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (3): Getting the most from the
least - Andrew Baxter describes the combined-cycle machines that power the
dash to gas

Over the past 10 to 15 years, combined cycle power generation has made a big
contribution to restoring the reputation of large utilities for safe,
efficient, and relatively unpollutive production of electricity.
After all the criticism - unjust or otherwise - heaped on utilities for
their dirty coal-fired plants or politically sensitive nuclear stations,
power generation using the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) method might
appear to be the answer to every power provider's prayers.
It isn't, of course, but in many respects it comes closest to achieving the
balance between the thermal efficiency and environmental friendliness now
sought by big utilities.
Combined cycle power plants use the exhaust gases from a gas turbine, which
are still at a temperature of at least 500 degC, to generate steam via a
waste heat recovery boiler. The steam is then used to drive a steam turbine.
This means that thermal efficiency, the amount of energy per unit of fuel
used, is about 55 per cent, much higher than simple cycle gas turbines or
the average coal-fired steam turbine plants. These currently achieve
efficiencies of 35 and 40 per cent respectively, although efficiencies of 45
per cent are claimed for the latest 'squeeky clean' conventional coal-fired
plants.
On top of increased thermal efficiency, CCGT power generation emits very
little sulphur dioxide, and has low nitrous oxide levels compared with
coal-fired stations. Assuming that efficient supplies of gas are available,
a CCGT station provides efficient, flexible and clean power generation.
It has taken a long time, and considerable expense by equipment suppliers,
to reach these efficiency levels. In the early 1960s the efficiency of
combined cycle plants in general was about 28 per cent, and by 1975 had
exceeded 40 per cent.
Today, the largest gas turbine currently in use is the 212-226MW General
Electric MS9001F machine, which is being manufactured jointly by GE of the
US and GEC Alsthom's European Gas Turbines subsidiary. In combination with a
120MW steam turbine in a Vega 109F unit, efficiencies of about 55 per cent
and an output of 335MW can be achieved.
It is not surprising, therefore, that combined cycle is expected to play
such a large part in fulfilling worldwide needs for additional power
capacity over the next 10 years.
GE forecasts 610GW (gigawatts, or thousands of megawatts) of capacity
additions from 1993-2002, of which 207GW will be provided by steam, 179GW by
combined cycle, 101GW by gas turbines alone, 85GW by hydroelectricity and
renewables, and 38GW by nuclear.
In the US over the same period, it expects most of the additions to be
combined cycle and gas turbines. The breakdown is 64GW of combined cycle,
25GW of gas turbines, 12GW of steam, 3GW of hydro and renewables and 1GW of
nuclear, amounting to 105GW of total capacity additions.
The general consensus in the industry is that efficiency improvements are
slowing down, and that it will take perhaps a decade for combined cycle to
exceed 60 per cent thermal efficiency.
But suppliers have not yet reached the point of diminishing returns, for a
simple reason: even very small percentage increases in thermal efficiency
can reduce a utility's annual fuel bill by millions of dollars or
equivalent, or allow it to produce more power from the same fuel cost.
Two developments in the power generating equipment industry this year show
that none of the handful of major suppliers would be happy if any one rival
was to take an unassailable lead in the thermal efficiency race - which is
really a poker game where each supplier tries to meet or raise his rival's
figure.
In February, GE announced a worldwide licensing agreement with Exergy, a
small California-based company, which will allow GE to graft the so-called
Kalina cycle technology on to the combined cycle process and possibly add
one or two percentage points to thermal efficiency.
The Kalina cycle, developed by Dr Alexander Kalina, a Russian emigre, avoids
some of the compromises inherent in the standard Rankine steam cycle by
using a mixture of fluids which have different boiling points - normally,
ammonia and water.
Using the mixture increases the thermodynamic availability of energy
transfer from the gas turbine exhaust to the steam turbine, and thus
produces more electricity from the same quantity of fuel.
Then, in September, Asea Brown Boveri announced the introduction of two big
new turbines which it claims will achieve a leap forward by offering 58 per
cent efficiency in combined-cycle plants on 60-cycle (Hz) power networks and
58.5 per cent in 50-cycle markets. ABB was worried by the GE gas turbines in
the early 1990s, but did not panic. Instead, it decided to branch away from
the conventional methods of raising efficiency - ever hotter gas turbines
giving higher exhaust temperatures in turn - and try something different.
ABB has gone back to a system it pioneered in 1948 known as sequential
combustion, which uses two combustion chambers within one gas turbine. The
aim is to avoid the frustrating trade-offs inherent in the conventional
approach - higher temperatures risk reducing reliability, while higher
efficiency can raise emission levels.
In the process ABB has leapfrogged GE and can offer a 365MW combined cycle
unit, including the steam turbine.
With rather less fanfare, all the suppliers have also been working on
improving the efficiencies of the steam turbines that are an integral part
of the combined cycle process.
In recent years there have been some important improvements to overall steam
turbine design, with single pressure turbines replaced by a double pressure
process or even a triple pressure process with reheat. These developments,
says Siemens of Germany, significantly improve the overall efficiency of the
combined cycle plant.
There have also been improvements in individual parts of the steam turbine,
notably the blading, and the aerodynamics of internal parts have been
improved using computational fluid dynamics. Each of these changes has a
small effect on overall efficiency, but together make a significant
contribution.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (2): On earth as in the
atmosphere - Energy squandering is targetted in Clinton's aggressive
clean-up plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the US tries to shake off its image as a profligate energy user, the
issue of energy efficiency has come increasingly to the fore. It was,
therefore, no great surprise last month when President Clinton's Climate
Action Plan to control global warming included about 50 initiatives to
improve energy efficiency.
The plan, which Mr Clinton described as 'a very aggressive and very specific
first step,' includes proposals to regulate more stringent efficiency
standards for household appliances such as air conditioners, cookers and
television sets; it is estimated that the US uses about 30 per cent more
energy per unit of activity in home appliances than other countries. Mr
Clinton is also looking at ways of getting private investments to improve
energy efficiency at federal dams.
In addition, Mr Clinton hopes to change the tax law to encourage increased
use of public transportation. The proposal would make employers who provide
employee parking also offer an equivalent cash subsidy to employees who use
other means of transportation.
The Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 already requires companies employing
more than 100 workers to reduce the number of cars driven to work or face
substantial monthly fines.
Other aspects of the plan include shoring up government programmes that help
companies evaluate their use of energy for lighting and computer systems.
Projects such as the Environmental Protection Agency's Green Lights
programme, which came to life under the Bush administration, are geared at
persuading companies and local governments that they will save significant
sums by using less energy. The Green Lights scheme helps companies and local
governments evaluate the efficiency of their existing lighting systems and
replace them with more energy efficient alternatives.
The EPA was so encouraged by the success of its Green Lights project that it
later launched Energy Star, a programme designed to encourage computer
companies to make energy efficient personal computers which automatically
switch to low energy consumption when not in use. Participation in both
schemes is strictly voluntary.
Businesses will also be encouraged to examine their heating, ventilation and
air conditioning systems and improve them for energy efficiency within seven
years.
But Mr Clinton, like his predecessor George Bush, has backed away from
proposing mandatory efficiency standards for business and industry, relying
instead on voluntary cooperation to cut both energy use and greenhouse gas
emissions not covered by the clean air legislation of 1990.
Mr Clinton has also steered clear of the politically contentious issue of
mandating higher car fuel efficiency standards. Instead, in a move which may
placate some critics, the administration and the big three US auto makers
plan to join forces in a research project to produce a new generation of
cars. The aim of the study is to cut auto emissions of carbon dioxide,
largely by designing cars which consumer fuel more efficiently.
The new cars, due to be designed in the next 10 years, should be three times
more efficient than the 28 miles per gallon used by today's average car. In
order for the plan to succeed, the new cars will also need to be as
comfortable, safe and affordable as current models.
To do this, the administration is giving the car makers access to defence
industry technology such as stronger, lighter-weight materials which were
developed for weapon systems and electronics initially designed for
anti-missile defence.
Meanwhile, existing car technology is being re-examined as the nation moves
towards compliance with the new standards legislated by the Clean Air Act
Amendment of 1990. And manufacturers are discovering that reduced emissions
and improved energy efficiency often go hand-in-hand.
The new standards apply to air pollution sources with a potential to emit
100 tons a year of any regulated pollutant, including nitrogen oxides,
sulphur dioxide and volatile carbon compounds. Although carbon monoxide is
excluded from the federal regulations, it is included in many state
implementation plans.
In the area of car engines, manufacturers are paying closer attention to
precombustion chambers on clean-and lean-burn engines. These systems not
only help reduce emissions significantly, they also improve fuel economy
compared with their uncontrolled rich- or lean-burn counterparts.
Car tyres are also being evaluated. Research by Michelin North America has
shown that CO emissions can be reduced significantly and energy efficiency
improved substantially by redesigning car and truck tyres. The company has
proposed introducing low-rolling resistance radials as a means of complying
with stricter air quality codes without redesigning vehicles. According to a
study by Michelin North America, which was presented this summer to the
Department of the Environment, annual emissions from passenger cars could be
slashed by 16.1m tons while heavy truck emissions could be cut by 4m tons
just by using new tyres.
Although low-rolling resistance passenger tyres cost significantly more than
standard tyres, the added expense could be largely offset by fuel savings.
Michelin estimates truck drivers would save Dollars 1,108 in fuel costs by
using these tyres, even after including the higher cost of the tyres. Bus
drivers would save about Dollars 170.80 using the tyres. Personal car
drivers, however, would pay more for the tyres than they would recoup in
fuel savings.
Other alternatives include the use of compressed natural gas vehicles. Vons,
a California-based grocery store chain, has been testing compressed natural
gas vehicles to help it comply with the Clean Air Act's stricter air
pollution standards for interstate transporters which go into effect next
year. Vons found that the long-haul truck tractors could cut emissions by up
to 75 per cent.
The Clinton administration may be loath to legislate wide-sweeping measures
to improve energy efficiency, but it has indicated that it will not balk at
fining companies which fail to comply with existing environmental standards.
When US Attorney General Janet Reno recently said that environmental
enforcement would be one of her top priorities, she added that stiff
penalties are necessary 'to make sure our business community knows that
companies that 'play by the rules' are not at a competitive disadvantage to
those willing to risk violating the law'.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (1): New incentives for investors -
Thailand's fragile coalition government has embarked on a policy of
decentralisation which should ease congestion in Bangkok while providing
more jobs to the poorer, outlying provinces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
After just a year in power the Thai government has felt obliged to publish a
48-page brochure about its achievements - a sign more of insecurity than of
overweening pride in its accomplishments.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat Party prime minister who was elected last
year following the army's slaughter of pro-democracy demonstrators and the
collapse of a government sympathetic to the military, has restored a measure
of political stability to Thailand over the past 15 months.
The mild-mannered Mr Chuan has held together a fragile five-party coalition
 -one of the original partners has been swapped for a smaller but more
amenable party - but has been criticised for indecisiveness and a failure to
tackle with sufficient vigour the various problems facing the country and
its fast-growing economy.
Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist who was one of the leaders of last
year's pro-democracy uprising, complains that the government has not done
enough to help poor farmers, combat crime or put an end to the traffic
congestion that plagues the capital Bangkok.
'Right now the government still doesn't have any clear-cut solution for
those issues,' says Mr Chamlong. It is a measure of Mr Chuan's political
difficulties that Mr Chamlong's own Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party is not
 -as one might infer from his critical comments - in the parliamentary
opposition, but rather one of the parties in the ruling coalition.
Yet, given a political climate in which most of the headlines have been made
not by discredited opposition parliamentarians but by in-fighting between
coalition partners seeking to enhance the influence of their ministerial
fiefdoms, it is perhaps remarkable that Mr Chuan has achieved anything at
all.
The mere survival of the government for more than a year is regarded as
noteworthy. 'In Thai politics this is considered an achievement for a
democratically-elected government,' comments Mr Sukhumbhand Paribatra, one
of Thailand's leading political scientists. According to Mr Supachai
Panitchpakdi, deputy prime minister, no elected government in Thailand has
survived its full four-year term. 'Somebody will have to break this jinx,'
he says.
Government officials such as Mr Supachai insist that they have achieved much
more than the disenchanted public gives them credit for; hence the need for
the brochure.
As promised in the election campaign, the government has embarked on a
policy of decentralisation which should ease congestion in Bangkok and the
eastern seaboard at the same time as bringing more jobs to the poorer,
outlying provinces.
To do this, the authorities have increased incentives for investors who
build factories in remote areas, and promoted cross-border economic
co-operation schemes that should benefit frontier towns such as Chiang Rai
in the north and Hat Yai in the south, although plans to decentralise
politics by having more local officials elected rather than appointed have
made only slow progress.
Mr Chuan has campaigned against child prostitution, tried to keep the armed
forces out of business and politics, and refused to be provoked into hasty
action by an outbreak of sabotage and shootings in the south (in which
Moslem separatists appear to have been exploited by disaffected right-wing
politicians and security force officers).
The Thai economy has thrived for years under dictatorial as well as
democratic governments, but Mr Chuan's coalition can justifiably claim to
have fostered continued economic growth without some of the rampant examples
of corruption which marred the records of previous regimes. Real gross
domestic product is expected to rise about 7.5 per cent this year and eight
per cent in 1994.
Financial discipline has been maintained - year-end inflation is expected to
be about 3.6 per cent - and the authorities have succeeded in curbing the
worst excesses of stock market manipulators and speculators. The threat of
US trade sanctions against Thailand has been diminished by a crackdown on
music, video and software piracy.
Government spokesmen admit that they have yet to solve some of problems
closest to the hearts of the middle-class voters who helped bring them to
power, including Bangkok's traffic jams and the daily damage to the
environment wrought by uncontrolled industrialisation and tourism. A water
shortage, blamed by environmentalists on the deforestation of watersheds, is
likely to affect both rice farmers and city-dwellers in the months ahead and
will prove a stern test of the government's popularity.
The government has at least made a tentative start to reforming the
educational system after decades of neglect by previous administrations.
Schooling will be compulsory for nine years instead of the current six, and
the state is to co-operate with the private sector on vocational training.
Businessmen and academics agree that a complete overhaul of Thai schools and
universities, which teach by rote and discourage initiative in the
workplace, is vital if the Thai economy is to continue competing effectively
with its equally dynamic Asian neighbours.
With wages rising and mechanisation on the increase, Thailand is already
losing its cheap labour advantage to countries such as China and Vietnam,
and therefore needs to enhance the technical skills of its workforce.
'In the near-term, we cannot hope to match Korea or Japan in terms of
raising our workers' standards or our technical standards,' says Mr Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister. 'But we certainly hope more than to
keep up with southern China, Indonesia and elsewhere.'
Thailand's manufactured exports are still rising sharply, but Thai industry
is poised at a point where it can rely neither on cheap labour nor on high
technology but only on a balance between the two.
'We have to be piggy in the middle,' says Mr Richard Han, chief executive of
Hana Microelectronics in Bangkok. 'The type of work we seem to be winning is
the type which requires a fair amount of manufacturing discipline and
process but still requires a fair amount of labour.'
With so many unsolved problems on the agenda - including inadequate
schooling, Bangkok's transport crisis, bureaucracy and corruption in the
civil service, environmental degradation, and rural poverty - it is hardly
surprising that siren calls for a return to 'strong' government are starting
to be heard in Thailand.
Such views reflect an emerging Asian orthodoxy, under the patronage of Mr
Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman, which suggests that enlightened
authoritarian rule is better for decision-making and political stability in
Asian countries than western-style liberal democracy.
'I think democracy has problems everywhere,' says Mr Anand Panyarachun,
Thailand's own enlightened authoritarian, who was praised for his work as
prime minister after being appointed by the military following a 1991 coup
d'etat. He has recently hinted that he would not mind doing the job again.
Others point to the particular weakness of Thai political parties: they lack
ideological underpinnings, tend to be tied to a particular military leader
or politician, and come and go with bewildering speed.
If Mr Chuan, grappling with his fragile coalition on the one hand and the
ambitions of the opposition and the armed forces on the other, succeeds both
in surviving his full term and in carrying out even half of what he intends,
that will be an achievement indeed.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (1): A burning global issue -
Most countries plan energy saving measures to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. But although there is scope for much greater fuel efficiency,
governments are failing to provide enough money to convert their words into
action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Energy efficiency evokes the same general acclaim as world peace. But
individuals, and even governments, are generally hesitant to back their
support with generous supplies of hard cash.
With crude oil prices at their lowest in real terms for 20 years and most
domestic fuel bills unchanged in recent years, there is not the urgency to
save energy that existed in the 1970s. Gone too is the fear that world
fossil fuel resources are rapidly running out.
The agenda for the energy efficiency industry has shifted to environmental
objectives. Most governments plan to use some energy saving measures as a
way of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions and environmentalists believe
that energy conservation must play a large part in combating global warming.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, underlined the
government's plans to use energy efficiency measures as part of its battle
against global warming when he almost doubled the funds available to
pensioners for home conservation measures to Pounds 35m in last week's
Budget.
His announcement followed criticism by a Commons select committee a week
earlier which attacked the government's policies on energy efficiency as
being incomplete and inadequately funded.
Mr Robert Skinner, director of the long-term co-operation and policy
analysis division of the International Energy Agency - the west's energy
monitoring body - highlights some of the difficulties involved in adopting
effective energy savings policies: 'while we all agree there is great
potential for increases in energy efficiency, most governments have little
idea how to go about achieving them.'
He stresses that few governments have any idea of how to set realistic
targets for energy conservation and, when they do, few understand how to
monitor them.
There is also the fear of 'bounce back,' where energy savings made in some
areas do not necessarily lead to a reduction in overall energy consumption.
This was experienced in Denmark where the government has very successfully
improved the efficiency of new appliances in recent years so that they use a
lot less electricity. But electricity consumption has risen - people have
more appliances.
This effect is often cited by detractors as a reason for not bothering with
energy efficiency. But if living standards continue to rise, arguably the
Danes would have purchased more appliances in any case and, if efficiency
standards had not been increased, they would be using even more electricity.
Since the residential sector of most advanced economies accounts for 60 per
cent of total electricity consumption, many countries have tried to target
domestic consumers in their efficiency drives. But this is, by its very
nature, a fragmented and imprecise art. It is hard to convince people that
they can do a lot more towards saving the world by lowering the central
heating or draught proofing their windows than by recycling their rubbish.
The UK government has tried to stress the environmental benefits of energy
saving in a series of television adverts. 'It is a very difficult message to
get across,' says Mr Colin Myerscough, director of the UK Energy Efficiency
Office.
Few governments can now afford to offer large grants for energy saving
measures. But the new buzzword in the sector is 'voluntarism', whereby
government forms partnerships with industry and utilities to promote energy
conservation.
In the Netherlands, which has set a target for improving energy efficiency
by 20 per cent by the end of the decade, the government has signed voluntary
contracts with 80 per cent of its industrial companies. These accords set
out energy savings targets and realistic measures that can be taken to
achieve them.
US utilities have taken this a step further by paying consumers to introduce
energy efficiency measures - so-called demand-side management. This is done
to some extent in Europe where companies slash prices of off-peak
electricity. In the US, the utilities annually spend Dollars 3bn to Dollars
4bn on these initiatives. This is partly self-interest since the regulatory
regime allows companies to charge only low electricity prices while adding
new plant is restrictively expensive.
Although such initiatives and better industrial practices have reduced
electricity demand slightly in the US, it is still three times that of
Japan. The average person in the US consumed 6.3 tonnes of oil equivalent in
1973 - by 1991 that had dropped to 5.4 tonnes. In Japan, demand increased
slightly from 2.3 to 2.5 tonnes.
The reason for the huge gap is largely the smaller flats and closer
proximity of the average Japanese household, added to the fact that many
energy-intensive industries have moved out of the country since the last oil
crisis.
One way of encouraging more energy conservation in the home is to introduce
higher standards of energy efficiency for domestic appliances. Until this
year, the US was the only OECD country with mandatory appliance efficiency
standards. These were recently expanded to include commercial heating,
cooling and water heating. Early this year, Canada passed legislation
providing for energy efficiency standards for 20 products including
household equipment.
The European Union has been studying whether to take a similar step and
plans to introduce a directive on energy standards for fridges and freezers
that would become effective in 1995 or 1997. One problem, aired by Mr Andrew
Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy in the
UK, is that when gaining agreement between all member states for such a step
standards can become watered down to the lowest common denominator. Some
countries are also labelling appliances for their energy efficiency.
Other countries have adopted innovative, market-led approaches to the
problem. For example, in Sweden, the National Board for Industrial and
Technical Development introduced a competitive procurement programme open to
Swedish and foreign companies. It guaranteed companies a market for the most
energy-efficient products they could produce - the government would buy them
for public housing.
As a result of the Swedish competition, a fridge was developed which was 35
per cent more energy-efficient than the market average. The success of the
programme has led the government to look at other procurement projects for
advanced window design.
In the US, a group has been launched called the Consortium for Energy
Efficiency, with members from public and private sectors. The consortium has
launched a 'golden carrot' strategy to develop 250,000 fridges that are 25
to 50 per cent more energy-efficient than comparable 1993 models. The
winning manufacturer will receive Dollars 30m which has been pooled by US
utilities as well as free promotion to the utility customers.
While curbing energy use in the home is likely to continue to be a piecemeal
and fragmented operation, governments are being urged by environmental
lobbies to introduce concerted transport policies in an effort to reduce
emissions. But the transport sector has proved strongly resistant to efforts
to conserve fuel.
Most developed countries have flirted with the idea of a carbon tax, but
this has proved to be politically unpalatable even if it could be shown to
work. International Energy Agency studies report that carbon taxes would
have to be set at very high levels to curb car use and, even then, the
effects would be short-lived.
Mr Skinner believes that, rather than imposing carbon taxes, developed
countries should work towards integrated planning regulations that ensure
any new buildings - particularly out-of-town housing estates - while
adhering to strict energy efficient building codes, should also be linked to
a public transport system that discourages car use over the longer term.
In short, energy efficiency is a fragmented industry where grand initiatives
tend to be inappropriate. Governments are adopting a piecemeal approach as a
way of meeting environmental targets. They are urged to do more by vocal
environmental lobbies, but low energy prices provide little incentive. And
households are unlikely to be spurred on to make great energy savings until
they are hit where it hurts: in their wallets.

FT  07 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Saatchi warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fragile status of US economic recovery and the even more fragile status
of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, one-time world beating media group, received a jolt as
Saatchi issued a gloomy trading statement which sent the stock plunging.
Speaking at a media conference organised by US investment house PaineWebber,
the group said it would have to carry out Pounds 10m of redundancies and
make other cuts that would hit 1993 profits.
The statement was a response to the loss of two big accounts and an
anticipated drop in 1994 earnings. The shares, which fell 23 to 157p, have
tumbled from a theoretical Pounds 50 a share since the October 1987 crash;
last year there was a one-for-10 consolidation which revalued the stock.
Neither that nor a Pounds 73m rights issue early this year have offset the
steady decline.
Broker SG Warburg was said to have been 'shocked' by the Saatchi statement
and analysts moved quickly to lower earnings forecasts. Hoare Govett cut its
1993 estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds 19m and next year's figure to Pounds
36.7m from Pounds 42m. Mr Guy Lamming of James Capel said worries over US
recovery and the impact of 'brand de-emphasising' would continue to overhang
the stock.
Rival media group WPP, which owns J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy and Mather,
lost 4 to 88p.
The second takeover bid in as many weeks kept the broadcasting sector
buzzing as Granada launched a Pounds 600m hostile offer for LWT.
The prospect of a prolonged assault prompted speculation in the market that
LWT's manouevring could be a ploy to entice an overseas bidder, either as a
white knight, or to draw a higher offer from Granada. Under the latest
government proposals, overseas players will be allowed to bid for UK
broadcasters after January 1, 1994.
Leisure analysts pronounced the bid as a good strategic move for Granada,
which came as the group announced full-year profits. These came in ahead of
market forecasts, prompting a raft of upgrades to around the Pounds 210m
level for 1994. However, some analysts are worried about the company's
longer term income stream. Granada slipped 5 to 485p in turnover of 5.4m.
LWT edged up a penny to 586p - 6p above the Granada all-share offer.
Familiar bid talk stalked regional brewer Morland as speculators responded
to a weekend press article which predicted the imminent return of Greene
King to the fray. The latter failed to land Morland last year and still
holds a 29.3 per cent stake. Speculation has been rife since October when
Whitbread restructured its shareholdings, giving it an 11.9 per cent stake
in Morland, with Greene King being tipped as the most likely buyer.
Yesterday, Morland shares surged ahead 53 to 578p, although dealers said
trading was thin. Greene King was steady at 570p, as was Whitbread 'A', at
561p.
Half-time results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle came within market forecasts,
although the dividend increase was considered disappointing. Profit-taking
left the shares 14 cheaper at 524p.
A bearish note on the oil sector issued by NatWest Securities, plus news
that Moody's, the US credit rating agency, is considering a downgrading of
debt ratings, with the emphasis on Enterprise Oil, saw the latter retreat 10
to 437p.
Other oils suffered from another weary performance from crude oil prices,
which settled well below the Dollars 14 a barrel mark. BP closed 4 1/2 lower
at 327 1/2 p. Hints of exploration success in the Yemen helped Clyde edge up
2 to 45p.
HSBC was hard on the heels of Standard Chartered as the bank sector's best
performer, with the strong showing by the Hong Kong market helping HSBC move
up 22 to 777p on good turnover of 3.9m. Lloyds rose 12 to 638p on 2.4m
traded, with Lehman Bros said to have been an aggressive buyer of the
shares, while TSB, a big mover recently, eased 3 1/2 to 234p on 6.5m traded.
Royal Bank of Scotland, another of the sector's front runners, spurted 9
more to a record 439p. Abbey National, on the other hand, declined 7 to
445p, with the market fretting about a further cut in the bank's mortgage
lending rates, a move which will impact on profit margins.
King &amp; Shaxson, the money broker, retreated 6 to 135p after revealing a
steep fall in interim profits and on news that it was considering the
acquisition of Greig Middleton, the stockbroker, which will involve K&amp;S
issuing up to 12m of its shares.
Life assurance stocks continued to suffer from worries about the imminent
report from the Securities and Investments Board.
Dealers said, however, that falls in the life stocks owed more to
deteriorating sentiment than any massive weight of selling. Legal &amp; General
weakened 13 to 519p and Prudential 6 1/2 to 354p.

FT  07 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard powers forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The startling share price performance of Standard Chartered, the banking
group, continued apace yesterday, with the stock climbing to another
all-time high as marketmakers, caught in the grip of an ever-tightening bear
squeeze, moved to close their short positions in the stock.
Standard Chartered shares have risen almost six-fold since January 1991 when
they reached a 10-year low of 208p, as the market anticipated the bank's
move to cut its dividend payment, the first reduction by one of the UK banks
in recent times. Since August 1992 Standard shares have moved up virtually
in a straight line, from 365p to yesterday's Pounds 12 level.
The stock shortage in Standard reached its peak around midday yesterday as
Swiss Bank, one of the leading marketmakers, triggered a backwardation in
the price by bidding Pounds 12 a share when other marketmakers were offering
to sell stock for considerably less. The backwardation was held for some
time, eventually subsiding as the shorts were filled in, and leaving the
shares a net 40 higher at 1193p.
Standard Chartered has been one of the big driving forces in the banking
sector's strong showing this year. The bank has long been rumoured as a bid
target, with Lloyds Bank, which retains a 4.6 per cent stake, still said to
covet the group, which it first tried to acquire in the early 1980s.
There were wild rumours circulating in the market late on Friday that one of
the big Swiss banks was casting an eye over Standard. A number of the big
broking houses said yesterday that Standard shares had overreached
themselves and were due for a reaction.

FT  07 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover activity features steady
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculative activity in the television and brewery sectors bore witness
yesterday to the positive mood of the UK stock market. Across the broad
range of leading stocks, profit-takers were comfortably balanced by new
buyers and share prices closed firmly. The pace was erratic, with the stock
index futures leading the activity.
Firmness in UK government bonds ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3bn of
10-year gilts, in the last bond sale of the year, encouraged equities,
offsetting suggestions in some quarters that base rate cuts might be
delayed. A good start by US Federal bonds, accompanied by an early advance
of 11 Dow points on Wall Street, encouraged London.
The FT-SE 100 Index finished 3.1 up at a new closing peak of 3,237.3, having
moved between 3,243.6 and 3,224.3 during the session. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index, which took in activity in the television stocks in the wake of
Granada's Pounds 600m bid for LWT Holdings, shaded down by 0.7 to 3,565.8.
The Granada bid, while not unexpected, set the Television sector alight.
Analysts quickly divided into those believing a rival bidder might appear
and those convinced that Granada could be induced to pay a slightly higher
price for LWT.
Elsewhere, it was mostly company trading statements that provided the
highlights. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Scottish and Newcastle, Airtours and National
Home Loans all stood out under this heading.
Seaq volume remained high at 601.9m shares against 749.2m on Friday when
retail business of Pounds 1.88bn indicated the continued vigour of the UK
stock market's reponse to last week's Budget from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer.
With little data on the domestic economy due this month, attention has
turned again to the US, where reports on producer and consumer prices will
be published this week. Nervousness regarding the Japanese stock market also
resurfaced, with equities opening lower in London yesterday after the
setback in Tokyo.
The best performances came again from the banks, where the clearers
continued to see benefits ahead for their bad debt lists from further falls
in UK base rates, while the merchant banks counted the profits made in such
active securities markets. Towards the close, the stock market have regained
its confidence that base rates rates will be cut again in the new year,
encouraged by the announcement of lower mortgage rates by one of Britain's
leading home loan groups. But insurance stocks gave back some of the gains
achieved following an unexpectedly benign Budget.
There were ready buyers across the range of consumer issues, with food
retailers, stores and hotels firm. Dividend prospects spurred strong gains
among the utilities.
The clouds hanging over crude oil prices kept the big oil stocks subdued
throughout the session, and signs of renewed pressure from New York left the
sector looking weaker in the final minutes of the trading session.
The blue chip manufacturing issues moved narrowly around overnight levels,
the pharmaceuticals lacking a lead from New York and many other big names
shying away from the firmness in sterling which offers little help to export
prospects. Overall, however, market strategists were confident that the
stock market has retained the confidence with which the Budget was greeted
last week.

FT  07 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers in the London derivatives market began to concentrate on the
exceptionally high level of open interest in Footsie futures as activity
drifted back to pre-Budget levels yesterday, writes Peter John.
By the close of business, the series in the FT-SE 100 Index which expires at
the end of next week still had open interest above 50,000 lots. That figure
represents the number of contracts bought as well as the number of contracts
sold. Some traders are concerned that those with long positions, mostly
investment funds and asset allocaters, might find it diff-icult to close out
their positions over the next eight trading days.
Many of the contracts will be rolled out to the next contract, which expires
in March. For the rest, the longs - ie buyers - will need to find a willing
seller. There is a feeling that because of exceptional profits made this
year and over the life of the December contract some of the shorts, who are
mainly marketmakers arbitraging between the level of the futures contract
and the level of the market, might prefer to let positions expire thus
taking the cash but creating an imbalance in the market.
The December contract opened at 3,252 and saw some if its unusually high
premium to cash narrow slightly before hitting 3,251, by the official close.
At that level however it still showed a premium of 13 in contrast to a fair
value estimate of zero.
Options turnover returned to a desultory level of 23,102 with stock options
activity headed by Lasmo as one investor sold 500 February calls and bought
500 May calls to roll forward the investment.

FT  07 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends just off record on
growth hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue chip stocks gained ground yesterday, buoyed by last week's batch of
good economic news and gathering strength in the bond market, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 6.14 ahead at 3,710.21,
just below the all-time closing high of 3,710.77 set on November 16. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.54 at 466.43. After a sharp early decline,
the Nasdaq composite partially recovered to end 1.13 off at 771.09. Activity
on the NYSE was heavy, with 292m shares dealt.
With no fresh economic indicators to offer direction, investors had an
opportunity to digest last week's stream of data, most of which pointed to
strong, non-inflationary growth. A growing sense of optimism quickly
translated into advances for blue chip issues.
The bond market, which continued to weather the economic tide with
surprising resilience, reinforced the positive sentiment.
In late trading the inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond was 25/32
higher at 101 1/16 , as traders anticipated favourable retail and wholesale
price data later this week.
However, equities slipped from their earlier highs late in the session as
investors began to book profits after nearly a week of steady gains.
Seagram was near the top of the NYSE's most active list after a trust which
manages finances for Mr Charles Bronfman, Seagram's co-chairman, sold 3.7m
shares in the company for nearly Dollars 100m. The stock slipped Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 26 3/4 .
Mellon Bank was marked down Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 53 on news that it
would take a Dollars 70m after-tax charge as a result of its agreed Dollars
1.85bn merger with Dreyfus, which climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 46 3/8 .
In other banking issues, Bankers Trust advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 79
1/4 , Citicorp was up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 and JP Morgan put on
Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 72 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, semiconductor issues fell sharply. Intel dropped
Dollars 4 to Dollars 59 1/2 after Merrill Lynch cut its near-term investment
rating on the stock. Applied Materials weakened Dollars 2 to Dollars 35 3/4
.
On the NYSE, Motorola declined Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 94 after it was
downgraded by Merrill. Among other semiconductor stocks, Texas Instruments
shed Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 1/8 and National Semiconductor was down Dollars
 3/4 at Dollars 14 7/8 .
Canada
Toronto relinquished an early rise to end a shade easier on balance as a
late retreat by gold shares and soft consumer products outweighed a strong
performance by bank issues.
The TSE 300 index lost 3.4 at 4,236.0 and declines narrowly outscored
advances by 409 to 393. Volume came to 56.6m shares valued at CDollars 626m.
The consumer products group fell 1.29 per cent and the golds index shed 1.2
per cent, while financial services gained 1.04 per cent.

FT  07 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Budget approval prospects
leave Milan up 2.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses moved on a variety of influences, and mostly higher, writes Our
Markets Staff, although both Frankfurt and Paris seemed to have run out of
impetus.
MILAN advanced 2.6 per cent with the bulk of the buying coming from domestic
investors, reassured by signs that parliamentary approval of the budget was
on track and with the results of the local elections providing no surprises.
The Comit index added 14.31 or 2.6 per cent to 564.15.
Credito Italiano shed L50 to L2,259: however, expectations of a heavy
oversubscription for the issue held the shares well above the L2,075
privatisation price, announced on Saturday.
Fiat rose L229 or 5.8 per cent to L4,200 in heavy volume of 23.2m shares.
News of higher sales in November provided limited impetus, analysts
suggesting that the share price, constrained throughout the group's capital
raising exercise, was now catching up with the strong performances of
European competitors over the last two months.
Generali, a loser last week, bounced L1,420 or 2.8 per cent higher at
L27,990 as investors, once again, focused on prospects for good annual
results from the insurance sector.
FRANKFURT tried to build on last week's rally, the DAX index hitting a
record intraday high of 2,133.31, but there was no backup from buy orders
and profit-taking came in.
The DAX ended 1.81 lower at 2,118.80, turnover easing from DM9.1bn to
DM8.9bn. At the heavier end of the corporate economy, Metallgesellschaft
dropped DM46, or 11.7 per cent to DM346.50 as Kugelfischer, the ball bearing
manufacturer, recovered DM11.50, or 8 per cent to DM156.
Kugelfischer has more than doubled from its 1993 low of DM72; yesterday saw
news that its operating losses had declined, and prospects had improved
further as a result of a restructuring programme.
Metallgesellschaft reported heavy losses, and passed its dividend less than
a fortnight ago. Combining commodities trading with environmental
technology, and more obviously vulnerable to metal prices, the company was
forced yesterday to acknowledge massive margin payments, and a liquidity
bottleneck after the slump in crude oil prices in recent weeks.
In electricals, meanwhile, AEG declined comment on speculation that it was
planning to sell its household appliances group to Electrolux of Sweden. The
shares rose DM5.40 to DM180.40.
AMSTERDAM was satisfied with Ahold's third quarter rise in profits and the
retailer's shares added 10 cents to Fl 45.80, off a day's high of Fl 46.20.
The CBS Tendency index put on 0.7 to 139.7.
Begemann, the engineering concern, gained Fl 1.30 to Fl 46.30 after
announcing that it planned to raise Fl 300m through a convertible bond
issue.
ZURICH continued to benefit from last week's better than expected inflation
and GDP data and the SMI index rose 17.4 to to a fourth consecutive record
high of 2,863.4.
Nestle, the most actively traded stock, rose SFr12 to SFr1,221 after
Friday's break through the SFr1,200 level.
BRUSSELS set a new record high on technical factors and strength of the
domestic currency. The Bel-20 index closed up 14.75 at 1,438.42.
Turnover was good at BFr2.6bn.
Among the significant movers Electrabel climbed BFr120 to BFr6,550 and
Tractebel BFr225 to BFr10,700.
PARIS did little during the session and the CAC-40 index closed just 1.66
points weaker at 2,186.74, having earlier seen a day's high of 2,195.72.
Turnover was estimated at some FFr3.4bn.
In a review of the market, JP Morgan said that the recent underperformance
of French equities has left the CAC undervalued in relation to the other
major European centres; it saw good prospects for 1994, particularly in the
consumer sector. The bank set an end-1994 target for the CAC-40 of 2,600.
ATHENS rose 1.6 per cent in heavy trading with the general index finishing
above the 900 point level for the first time since late August, closing
14.13 points higher at 913.15.
The market was encouraged by the absence of taxes relating to equity
investment when the government unveiled its new tax bill last Friday.
TEL AVIV spurted late in the session on last-minute buying, described by
dealers as a correction after losses last week. The Mishtanim index gained
3.57, or 1.5 per cent to 241.77 on relatively low turnover of Shk318m.
WARSAW extended its latest bull run, the WIG index rising by 412.9, or 4.5
per cent to 9,585.3 in active turnover of 1,200bn zloty. Some brokers said
that money frozen for the Bank Slaski offer could be returning to the
market, following news that buyers would only get three shares each.

FT  07 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 3.5% on
concern over stimulus package
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that the government will not announce additional stimulus measures
before the passage of the supplementary budget through parliament
discouraged investors, and the Nikkei average tumbled 3.5 per cent, falling
through the 17,000 level for the first time in four trading days, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 618.97 to 16,840.38, its first decline in five
trading days. The Topix index dropped 46.25, or 3.2 per cent, to 1,413.86,
and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 2.99 to 1,148.82.
The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 17,425.14 but small-lot arbitrage
selling depressed share prices after a fall in futures. The index hit the
day's low of 16,783.48 just before the morning close, but resisted a further
decline on encountering index-linked buying by investment trusts.
Volume fell to 220m shares from 271m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 1,020
to 74, with 61 issues unchanged.
Investors had hoped that the government would announce an emergency fiscal
package this week, to include cuts in income tax and land transaction taxes.
However, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa needs to clear other political
issues before a decision on a new stimulation package can be reached.
Meanwhile, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, reiterated that the
government would not take steps to prop up the equity market.
The arrest of Mr Shigeru Sato, president of Kabuto Decom, a property
developer listed on the over-the-counter section, also depressed sentiment.
Prosecutors allege that Mr Sato forged commercial bills in the name of
Kabuto's subsidiaries.
The Tokyo stock exchange suspended trading of Kabuto on the OTC market after
the reports. Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, Kabuto's main creditor, slipped Y35 to
Y480.
Daikyo, a condominium developer, dropped Y64 to Y912 after Carolina, a real
estate company listed on the second section and in which Daikyo has the
largest shareholding, announced that it was withdrawing from textile and
agriculture operations. Carolina eased Y1 to Y309.
Banks declined on profit-taking. Sumitomo Bank relinquished Y60 to Y1,980
and Sakura Bank Y10 to Y1,500. Brokers were also weak, with Nomura
Securities down Y80 to Y1,770 and Nikko Securities losing Y70 to Y1,030.
In Osaka, the OSE average plunged 624.86 to 18,694.88 in volume of 11.3m
shares.
Roundup
The fall in Tokyo seemed to have little direct impact on the region's
markets. Manila was closed due to a typhoon.
HONG KONG surged ahead 3.3 per cent on heavy foreign demand, in spite of
rising friction between Britain and China. The Hang Seng index climbed
315.34 to 9,609.69 in turnover swollen to HKDollars 7.2bn from Friday's
HKDollars 5.8bn.
Last week's decision by Governor Chris Patten to press ahead with a partial
electoral bill, in spite of Chinese opposition, was viewed as removing a
major source of uncertainty in the market.
The sharp rise was partly fuelled by surging index futures and a jump in the
shares of HK Telecom, up 90 cents at HKDollars 15.60. December index futures
added 400 at 9,785, for a premium of 175 points to the spot index.
The newly listed Consolidated Electric Power, Hopewell's power operations in
China and the Philippines, finished at HKDollars 15, against a high of
HKDollars 15.50 and its offer price of HKDollars 12.50. Hopewell was 20
cents ahead at HKDollars 8.85.
KUALA LUMPUR was driven to an all-time peak by heavy speculative demand
prompted by rumours of takeovers and timber concessions. The composite index
put on 17.19, or 1.7 per cent, at 1,041.11 in volume of 901.8m shares, the
highest since October 28 when 909.2m was recorded, and compared with 628.5m
last Friday.
Idris Hydraulic rose 40 cents to MDollars 6.20 amid talk that it had secured
a timber concession deal in Burma.
KARACHI advanced to a two-year high on renewed foreign demand when the
market reopened after a three-day break. The KSE 100-share index added 16.46
at 1,791.40.
SEOUL moved ahead for the third straight session, with continuing demand for
blue chip manufacturers outweighing institutional sales of financials and
shares with low price-to-book ratios. The composite stock index rose 4.90 to
826.49.
SINGAPORE edged lower on losses in some shipyard and property stocks,
although Malaysian shares traded over the counter and Singapore's second and
third liners were actively dealt. The Straits Times Industrial index dipped
3.96 to 2,147.54.
TAIWAN advanced 2 per cent to close at its highest level since May on buying
of the plastics sector. The weighted index gained 99.44 at 4,708.17 in
turnover of TDollars 66.9bn.
Plastics forged ahead on expectations that the industry will see a turnround
next year. The Formosa Plastics group's announcement last week that it would
soon start major construction work on its Dollars 9bn petrochemical complex
also triggered strong buying . Formosa Plastics surged TDollars 2.80 to
TDollars 52 and its affiliate Nan Ya Plastics ended TDollars 2 up at
TDollars 53.50.
AUSTRALIA rose moderately in thin trading and the All Ordinaries index
finished 6.3 firmer at 2,053.7. Turnover amounted to ADollars 318.6m.

FT  07 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe strives to end year with a rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As strategists continued to discuss the threat of higher US interest rates
last week, lower domestic interest rates drove the best performers higher in
both Europe and Asia.
In Europe, with a gain of 3.1 per cent, there was a sense of bourses
striving to produce the traditional year-end rally which would allow their
clients to close their books happily on December 31.
To help them, they had more positive statements concerning the Gatt
negotiations, the favourable UK Budget and the round of interest rate cuts
triggered by the 0.25 percentage point reduction in the German repurchase
rate, said Mr Marcus Grubb, the Salomon Brothers strategist.
Austria topped the performance figures with a rise of 4.8 per cent. November
was a good month for Vienna money markets, says Mr Frank Jonuschat at
Kleinwort Benson, the intervention rate coming down from 6.2 to 5.8 per cent
over the month and lifting the banking sector after three months of
underperformance.
Highly geared utilities such as EVN and Verbund continued to lead the
market, says Mr Jonuschat, rising on the effect of lower interest rates on
their financing costs and on the benefits both utilities will enjoy from
domestic tax reform in Austria, including the abolition of the asset and
trade taxes.
In Asia, Malaysia's climb of 4.3 per cent took its halcyon year, so far, to
a gain of more than 84 per cent in local currency terms. Foreign &amp; Colonial
Emerging Markets said last week that Kuala Lumpur continues to be driven by
overseas investors, particularly from Japan. It adds that the slight
month-on-month rise in Malaysia's CPI caused it little concern, and that
banks continue to cut interest rates.
F &amp; C, however, has its reservations: 'Given the current stock market
strength, it is worth observing that the market capitalisation of the Kuala
Lumpur stock exchange is now three times Malaysia's GNP, and is one of the
reasons why we are cautious about the market at present.'
Meanwhile, at Goldman Sachs, the bank's US economic and strategy teams
believe that US long-term interest rates are unlikely to rise on a sustained
basis, primarily because growth is likely to slow again and inflation should
remain subdued. The London strategy pairing of Mr Sushil Wadhwani and Mr
Mushtaq Shah believe global equities have been over-reacting, and that
equity market weakness caused by rising rates will prove temporary.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Elections boost lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian lira moved safely above last week's lows in European trading
yesterday, as markets reacted well to the news that left wing alliances won
control of Italy's main cities in the second round of voting in local
elections, writes Emma Tucker.
For most of the day the currency was steady at L991.60 against the D-Mark,
closing moderately firmer at L989.8 compared with Friday's L995.3.
Last week the lira dropped as low as L1,000 to the D-Mark, but foreign
exchange dealers said the local election results, which suggested that
Italy's political extremists had been held in check, had allowed the
currency to regain some strength.
In a letter to the Italian Treasury yesterday, the International Monetary
Fund said the lira could recoup some of its recent depreciation once the
political situation becomes clearer.
'The decline of the lira since September 1992 has clearly gone beyond that
deemed appropriate by the authorities,' the IMF said in its letter. It added
that Italy's progress towards European Monetary Union should 'take place
mostly through a nominal appreciation of the lira from the current lows . .
. rather than through an inflation differential'.
Italian government bond futures also took heart from the election results,
which were widely interpreted as a signal of greater political stability.
The December contract ended almost 1 1/2 points up.
Still basking in the wake of Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget, the pound ended
only mildly down from Friday's close, although early trading saw it push
briefly through the DM2.5600 level.
Many analysts said sterling was unlikely to be able to move much higher than
this as the market is looking for another reduction in UK interest rates,
and the higher the pound goes, the sooner the cut is likely to come.
Mr Jonathan Hoffman at Credit Suisse First Boston said the markets believed
a further cut could come within the next two weeks. 'The RPI figures next
week could be the trigger,' he added. 'I think that people sense that if the
pound becomes too strong the government will cut rates sooner rather than
later.'
Mr Tony Norfield of ABN Amro Bank believes the pound will have hit DM2.5700
by the end of the week.
The pound closed in London at DM2.5575, down  3/4 pfennig from last week's
finish.
On the UK money markets, the three-month interbank rate eased slightly as
dealers continued to look for further UK monetary relaxation. On the offered
side, it dipped to 5 1/4 per cent from Friday's 5 5/16 per cent.
Mr Norfield said that although people were adopting the view that interest
rates would soon come down, the market has yet to fully reflect the extent
of the expected reductions. 'Short sterling has been quite buoyant and I
think people will soon start buying contracts for the middle of 1994,' he
said.
The short sterling March contract moved as high as 94.98 in fairly busy
trading to discount base rates of just above 5 per cent by the beginning of
the spring. It closed at roughly 94.96, marginally ahead of the opening.
The Bank of England removed a Pounds 1.15bn shortage easily, offering no
late assistance.
German call money rates were little changed from Friday and market liquidity
remained ample as banks waited for this week's repo funds, allocated
tomorrow, before building reserves.
Call money changed hands at 6.23 per cent, but the rate is expected to drop
to 6 per cent either tomorrow or on Thursday, after the repo funds have been
allocated. The Bundesbank announced after its council meeting last Thursday
that the next five two-week repo tenders would be at a fixed rate of 6 per
cent after last week's 6.25 per cent pact.
The Bank of Portugal cut its regular money market intervention rates by  1/8
percentage point to 10.125 per cent for draining liquidity and 11.125 per
cent for injecting funds at the start of a new seven-day accounting period
for commercial bank cash reserves.
The central bank emergency lending rate for Es100bn of one-day funds to
resident banks was at an unchanged 12 per cent. Last week it mopped up
liquidity at 10.00 per cent and injected funds at 11.5 per cent in
mid-period interventions at which rates are normally less favourable for
commercial banks.
The dollar was weaker against the D-Mark in late European trading, although
it recovered from a fall through the closely watched DM1.7050 level.
Price swings were exaggerated by thin volumes of trading, and many dealers
believe the currency will be range-bound this week, which contains
relatively little US economic news. The focus for the currency will be
producer price and consumer price inflation figures due on Thursday and
Friday respectively.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.7060, compared with a four-month high
reached on Friday - after encouraging jobless data - of DM1.7295 and the
close on Friday of DM1.7205. In New York yesterday it finished at DM1.7013.
Once again the French franc nudged its former exchange rate mechanism floor
of FFr3.4305 per D-Mark, buoyed by the prospect of a deal on Gatt. It closed
in London at FFr3.434, up marginally from Friday's close of FFr3.437.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Sterling
windfall brings machinery mini-boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers visiting last week's Smithfield Show had their cheque books at the
ready
The organisers of last week's Royal Smithfield Show at Earl's Court in
London are describing it as the most successful for five years. They report
that the attendance was some 44,000 - up 8,000 on last year; that two-thirds
of visitors were substantial farmers; and that one-third of the total placed
an order while there.
For although Smithfield is widely known as the indoor farm show at which
champion meat animals are chosen, it is also the main British winter
exhibition for agricultural machinery. Indeed, for the majority of farmers
who do not show their animals competitively, machinery has dominated the
event for many years and is the main reason why most take a December trip to
London.
A year ago, many farmers did not bother to attend the show. They had no
money to spend and the prospect was that, following reform of the European
Union's common agricultural policy, they would have even less before long.
So in 1992 farmers stayed away in droves.
Those who went to Earl's Court asked one another how long the show could
survive. There was talk of holding it every second year as a compromise.
Some said the agricultural industry could not afford two major national
shows - the Smithfield and the Royal, held outdoors in July - and that one
would have to go.
But a year is a long time in agriculture. The full effects of the UK's
departure from the ERM have now expressed themselves in the shape of higher
farm prices. The increases, brought about by the working of the EU's green
monetary system, which supports the local value of guaranteed prices in
European currency unit terms when a national currency is devalued, in most
cases exceeded reductions caused by CAP reform. The value of compensation
for set-aside also increased for similar reasons and suddenly many UK
farmers found themselves unexpectedly flush with cash.
As always, when farmers have money, they spend it - and not always in the
best long-term financial interests of their businesses. For although farm
incomes have had a boost, they are still a long way short, in real terms, of
where they were 10 years ago.
But there were good reasons to spend this year. The most pressing was that
few machines had been replaced for several years and many were becoming
unreliable and expensive to maintain. The fact that farmers themselves are
being forced, because of labour economies, to drive tractors themselves,
helps persuade them to buy new. And the 40 per cent first-year capital
allowance against tax, which applied until October 31, clinched the decision
for many.
The result was that UK tractor sales to the end of October were up by 29.4
per cent and although the carrot of capital allowance has now disappeared,
the Agricultural Engineers' Association estimates that total sales to the
end of the year will reach about 18,500 units, compared with the long-time
low of 14,296 in 1992.
The AEA further expects UK sales of combine harvesters, which represents
some 20 per cent of the total value of the farm machinery market, to be up
by at least 6 per cent on last year's 1,014 units. Other machinery, for
cultivation etc, that is not registered and is therefore more difficult to
count, is expected to be up 15 per cent in cash terms. But because
two-thirds is imported and list prices have risen (the reverse side of the
sterling devaluation coin) the rise in volume of sales is probably nearer 7
per cent.
All of this may appear to suggest that farmers are doing pretty well and
that CAP reform is not hurting - so it cannot be working. But comparison
with tractor sales figures in countries that have not benefitted from a
currency devaluation is instructive.
In Greece, sales are down an estimated 64 per cent on last year, which
admittedly was exceptional; in Holland, 48 per cent fewer tractors have been
sold this year than last, again partly the result of special tax concessions
in 1992. Denmark, which had no special circumstances, has recorded 37 per
cent fewer sales and Belgium's are 25 per cent down. French and German sales
figures are respectively 5 per cent and 11 per cent lower than in 1992.
Overall, EU farmers are estimated to have bought 13 per cent fewer new
tractors this year than last.
And, as many advisers to the farming industry said at the Smithfield Show,
the agricultural economics which dictated those gloomy figures will hit the
UK soon.
Benefits from devaluation were once and for all. The politicians did not
mean it to happen. It was an accident. A Gatt agreement, which will almost
certainly impose further cuts in farm incomes and production, now looks more
likely than at any time since negotiations began in 1987. The best plan for
UK farmers would be to hang on to as much as possible of the extra income
from farming in 1993 because it will not last, the pundits said.
Many farmers, the report from the Smithfield Show seems to indicate, ignored
that advice. Indeed, the trend was towards even bigger, more expensive
machinery, on the basis that more horse-power means less paid-labour and the
ability to earn money by doing contract work for neighbours. The average
horse-power of the tractors sold so far this year is up 5 per cent from 1992
against a rolling annual increase of just 2 per cent.
Good luck to the farm machinery trade, which will make hay while the EU's
area-aid cheques shine. But judging by experience elsewhere its members
should not expect the mini-boom to last.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU urged to promote 'high
natural value' agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European farmers could be required to adopt environmentally-friendly
practices to qualify for common agricultural policy support, according to a
report published today on farming and nature conservation.
The report, published by the independent Institute for European
Environmental Policy, calls for a mix of policies to promote 'high natural
value' farming. This includes grazing with fewer animals, growing cereals
with fewer agro-chemicals and traditional cultivation of olives and other
tree crops.
'Extensive farming systems. . . support large areas of semi-natural habitat
which harbour many rare and endangered species of wildlife,' it says.
Such farming is often in jeopardy, either because it is no longer
economically viable or because some CAP support encourages intensification,
says the report, prepared for the Dutch agriculture ministry. It cites aid
for new irrigation or for grubbing-up olive groves.
It proposes expanding direct incentives to farmers who use
environmentally-sensitive methods, as provided for in the
'agri-environmental' programmes that member states are drawing up in line
with CAP reforms.
However, budget constraints are likely to limit the growth of environmental
incentive payments, especially in poorer regions, the report says. 'A
significant measure of support will continue to be essential for most 'high
natural value' farmers. This reinforces the importance of integrating
environmental objectives into the principal CAP support instruments.'
For example, non-intensive livestock farmers could be encouraged by linking
support more closely to land management or making it conditional on
low-density grazing.
Adapting payments to serve environmental objectives should cost little more
and 'might strengthen the case for retaining direct payments within the CAP
in the long term'.
Other suggestions in the report include: exempting non-intensive arable
farmers from set-aside; paying livestock farmers on difficult terrain
according to area rather than number of animals; investing in infrastructure
such as shelter for shepherds and livestock; and marketing products from
environmentally-friendly farms with an EU-wide labelling system.
'The objective is not to make farmers into 'park keepers' but to establish
sustainable forms of agriculture,' it says.
Farming of this kind should not be seen as unproductive. 'In fact, it may be
considered more in tune with the demands of the currently over-supplied EC
food market.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Resumption of central bank gold
sales forecast, unless prices rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central banks are engaged in a long-term effort to extricate themselves from
the gold market and convert their huge holdings - 1.1bn troy ounces - into
useful and more liquid foreign currency reserves, according to the New
York-based precious metals research organisation, CPM Group.
The key to future disposals will rest with gold prices, it suggests. 'If the
rise in gold prices, from Dollars 326 in March to Dollars 380 in November
proves not to be the beginning of a larger upward move for gold, central
bank disposals will resume,' says Mr Jeffrey Christian, CPM's managing
director.
He recalls that central banks sold an estimated 34.1m ounces of gold from
their monetary reserves during the past two years, the greatest volume since
1967-68. The bulk of the sales were in 1992 and the first quarter of this
year but since that time the nascent rally in gold prices has caused the
banks to refrain temporarily from selling more. 'No one wants to be selling
gold at the beginning of a cyclical upward move in prices,' says Mr
Christian. 'Therefore, prudence dictates caution at this time.'
This caution is offset by ingrained attitudes within central banks, however.
'If a central bank has decided to reduce its gold holdings as a matter of
policy, but its managers then decide to wait to sell in expectation of
higher prices, they are in effect speculating on the price of gold,' CPM
states in a new report.
But given the perceived greater unpredictability of gold prices, there is
increased resistance among managers to being seen as waiting for higher
prices.
CPM says that it is fortunate for gold producers that gold prices are likely
to move up in the next year or so. 'If this proves to be the case, central
bank gold deliveries in 1994 may be less than half the 22m ounces delivered
to the physical market in 1993.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel and copper lead advance
in metal markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals prices at the London Metal Exchange all moved up strongly
yesterday, led early on by nickel and later by copper, the exchange's
flagship contract.
As brisk trading saw overhead, chart-based resistance broken down in several
markets, gains on the day ranged between 0.47 per cent, for tin, and 3.49
per cent, for nickel.
Nickel's early strength was in part a response to reports of a strike at
Russia's Norilsk smelter, which, according to a senior executive, last year
produced 240,000 tonnes of the metal, equivalent to nearly 40 per cent of
western world supply. That helped to lift the LME three months delivery
price above a significant chart point at Dollars 4,830 a tonne.
The Norilsk strike reports were later denied by the company, but by then the
bullish sentiment seemed firmly entrenched and the three months price held
most of its gain to close at Dollars 4,947.50 a tonne, up Dollars 167 on the
day and the highest since early August.
The next strongest performer was lead, which extended its recent upward run
to Dollars 40 in seven trading days with a Dollars 10.75 rise to a Dollars
457.25-a-tonne close for three months metal. That 10 1/2 -month high meant
the market had exceeded its immediate chart objective, dealers said, but
with supplies of lead concentrate (an intermediate material) remaining tight
and demand from car battery makers continuing strong a further push towards
the next major chart resistance area at Dollars 486 a tonne was not being
ruled out.
Aluminium joined in the upward move but proved unable to breach strong
resistance near Dollars 1,090 a tonne for the three months delivery
position, which closed at Dollars 1,088.25 a tonne, up Dollars 12.50 from
Friday.
The aluminium market's fundamentals remain 'dire', according to the latest
report from Billiton-Enthoven Metals. 'And our reading of the technical
charts confirms the view that any sustained upward movement is unlikely',
the London-based firm says.
It notes that when it last detailed aluminium smelter production cuts in
late June 'rumours abounded of impending further cuts in the US'. But
subsequent announcements by Aluminum Company of America and Reynolds Metals,
have failed to make any real impact, 'indeed the latter's announcement
actually coincided with a slump in prices in mid-late August'.
'At these depressed prices,' Billiton says, 'and with renewed weakness
widely anticipated, the obvious conclusion would be that more producers will
be forced to lower their production'. But it suggests that such moves may be
delayed while results are awaited from talks between the Commonwealth of
Independent States, the US, the European Union, Norway and Australia on
multilateral cuts.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Italian sector rallies in wake of election
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian bonds rallied in the wake of Sunday's local elections, which brought
left-wing or left-backed candidates to power in five major cities and
allayed fears of a surge in support for the extreme right.
Market participants were also cheered by hopes that the 1994 budget, passed
by the budget committee of the lower house on Friday, will be approved
before the year-end.
Most of the action took place in the futures pits, with the March BTP future
on Liffe rising 1.77 points from Friday to end at 114.82.
Cash activity was more subdued, meanwhile, with domestic investors holding
back ahead of today's holiday in Milan and tomorrow's national holiday.
Despite their latest surge, some analysts feel Italian bonds still offer
good value in the medium term.
'On a six-month view, I would go for unhedged exposure to the Italian
market,' recommended Mr Marco Pianelli, southern Europe economist with
Nomura Research Institute in London.
He expects Italian bonds to continue outperforming Spanish bonds. The spread
between the higher-yielding Italian 10-year benchmark and its Spanish
counterpart narrowed to 73 basis points from 120 on Thursday but he expects
it to shrink further to around 20 basis points by mid-1994. Moreover, he
sees 'potential for sharp appreciation of the lira, which has been seriously
oversold'.
UK gilts ended on a firm note, with shorter maturities outperforming the
rest of the yield curve on continuing hopes of near-term base rate cuts.
Easing hopes now focus on the November RPI data, due to be released next
week.
The March long gilt contract rose by  9/32 to 117 17/32 .
The Dutch government raised Fl 7.5bn from the first tap sale of its new 5.75
per cent 10-year bond. The tap was opened at an issue price of 99.35 but the
finance ministry raised this in several steps to 99.60, yielding 5.80 per
cent. The tap sale - the first towards the government's 1994 borrowing
programme - is expected to continue until the finance ministry has raised
about Fl 10bn, traders said.
Dealers reported outright buying of the bonds by domestic and international
investors as well as switching into the new paper from German and French
bonds.
German bonds were boosted in early trade by Friday's gains in the US
Treasury market, but made little headway in the absence of significant flows
or market-moving news. The March Bund futures contract on Liffe ended at
100.02, up 0.02 points from Friday's close.
French government bonds also edged higher, lifted by the firmer tone in
bunds and by hopes of more rate cuts amid continued currency strength. The
December notional bond contract on Matif rose by 0.26 points to 124.50.
Japanese bonds hit another six-year high as the stock market tumbled again.
Rate-cut speculation intensified as the three-month certificate of deposit
rate dropped to a new low of 1.98 per cent, from 2.08 per cent on Thursday,
despite a tight money market operation by the Bank of Japan.
The March JGB futures contract rose to 0.37 point on the day to close at
116.54.
With no significant economic news to guide it, the US Treasury market
climbed steadily in anticipation of reassuring inflation data due out later
this week.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  25/32 ahead at
101 1/16 , with the yield falling to 6.166 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note edged  3/32 higher to 100 5/32 , to yield 4.15 per cent.
Driven in part by technical factors, prices improved throughout the day,
building on the market's surprisingly positive reaction to Friday's strong
employment data.
At the end of last week, inflation-sensitive bonds advanced despite a jump
in non-farm payrolls and a sharp drop in unemployment. The advance suggested
a consensus had emerged that inflationary pressures were under control.
That view is expected to be reinforced when November producer price data on
Thursday show no change, analysts say, while Friday's consumer price index
is expected to inch 0.2 per cent higher.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Westpac Banking forms
derivatives trading unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westpac Banking Corp, the Australian bank, has set up a separately
capitalised offshoot for derivatives trading. Westpac Derivative Products
(WDP) will be rated triple-A by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating
agencies.
Several participants in the derivatives market have set up similar units,
notably Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Paribas. Banks and securities
houses with ratings below double-A are at a disadvantage in the lucrative
derivatives business, as clients are credit-sensitive; a triple-A rated unit
allows them to compete on a more even playing field.
WDP will have an initial capital base of Dollars 200m, half in paid-in
capital from Westpac; the balance will be provided by a surety bond issued
by Capital Markets Assurance Corp (CapMac), a specialist insurance company.
The amount of capital required will increase according to the level of
exposure. WDP will be wound up if Westpac falls below investment grade, and
if other defined 'trigger events' occur.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Lebanon delays plans to raise Dollars
300m for Beirut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Lebanese government has announced a delay in its plans to raise Dollars
300m for reconstruction work in Beirut by issuing Eurobonds, in the hope of
obtaining more favourable terms in the new year.
The country's first Eurobond offering was due by the end of 1993, but has
now been delayed until March or April 1994, according to Mr Fouad Siniora,
the finance minister.
He refused to explain the delay, other than saying there was no immediate
need for the money. He said the projects to be financed by the issue - the
rehabilitation of Beirut's mainly Shi'ite southern suburbs and a road
network - were not yet ready to go ahead.
Market analysts, however, believe the issue was postponed so that the
government could assess the reception of the Dollars 650m equity offering of
Solidere, a Dollars 1.8bn property company set up to rebuild the centre of
Beirut, which closes on January 10.
The bonds were expected to be priced to yield between 350 and 400 basis
points over US Treasuries, which some market observers described as 'junk
bond pricing'.
No underwriters have been appointed to arrange the offering so far, but Mr
Siniora said that Merrill Lynch, Banque Paribas, Banque Indosuez, and Saudi
American Bank had all expressed an interest in the deal.
The delay will also give time for a potential breakthrough in the peace
talks between Israel and Lebanon, which would boost market confidence,
allowing the bonds to be priced at a tighter spread.
Elsewhere, the Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society launched a Pounds 150m
issue of 7 1/8 per cent 10-year bonds, arranged by UBS. Dealers said demand
was rather lacklustre, due to a general slow-down ahead of the year-end.
'There was nothing wrong with the pricing (of 60 basis points over the yield
curve for an A1-rated name), but there was nothing to grab investors'
interest either,' said one trader.
Dealers said that the tone of the sterling bond market remains positive, but
investors are focusing primarily on gilts ahead of Wednesday's auction, and
with hopes of a further rate cut still strong.
By the end of the day, the yield spread had widened slightly to 63 basis
points.
In the D-mark sector, two more German states tapped the market, using
similar structures. Saxony's DM300m offering was billed as a 10-year bond
extendible in years 10 and 15, while Bremen's DM200m deal was described as a
15-year deal with a put option annually from year eight; both essentially
offer the investor the option to extend the maturity of the bonds.
Two Australian companies have tapped the US debt market. CRA Finance, part
of the mining and minerals group, raised USDollars 300m via a public note
offering in the Yankee bond market and MIM Holdings USDollars 140m through a
private placement of senior unsecured notes, writes Nikki Tait.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Banks concerned at EU
adequacy rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and securities houses are likely to have to spend more on technology
and management improvements to comply with new rules governing securities
trading than on allocating more capital to cover risks, according to a
report*.
The study by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, based on interviews
with 35 banks, investment firms and regulators, found that they were most
worried about systems adjustments needed to comply with European Union (EU)
capital adequacy directive.
The capital adequacy directive and proposals on market risk from the Basle
committee of banking supervisors' have raised concerns that banks will have
to set aside more capital to cover securities trading and underwriting
risks.
But the study, led by Mr Peter Cooke, former chairman of the Basle
committee, concludes that investments in systems to monitor both risk and
allocation of capital are likely to exceed the cost of new capital in many
cases.
It found that large firms which had already invested in risk pricing models
for their securities and derivatives trading businesses tended to welcome
the directive because they believed it would give them an advantage.
The study says firms becoming subject to consolidated supervision for the
first time, and must collect data from around the world on trading
relationships with counterparties, will find it 'particularly onerous'.
Mr Cooke said the systems costs might 'force some of the smaller players out
of the market' although regulators were likely to discourage concentration
in derivatives activities to limit systemic risks.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bridge Oil buys US assets for
ADollars 76m

<TEXT>
Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas company, yesterday announced that it
is buying a number of properties - including some undeveloped acreage - in
the US from Santa Fe Energy Resources for around ADollars 76m (USDollars
50m). It also unveiled plans to float a minority interest in its American
subsidiary in the US.
The assets are being acquired by Bridge Oil (USA), the company's existing US
vehicle, which is currently 100 per cent owned by the Australian parent.
They include producing natural gas and oil properties in the Anadarko Basin
in Oklahoma, in the Texas Panhandle, and other smaller interests in Wyoming
and central Texas.
Bridge said that the properties currently contain about 56.8bn cu ft
equivalent of net proved and probable reserves, worth ADollars 60m.
The exploration acreage, costing ADollars 16m, totals about 9.2m acres in
the western US, the bulk of which offers exploration rights for up to 13
years and conversion into long-term production leases if a discovery is
made.
The company plans to fund the deal via a mixture of cash and shares -
including the delivery of a 10 per cent interest in Bridge Oil (USA) to
Santa Fe Energy. The initial public offering of shares in Bridge Oil (USA),
which is conditional on regulatory approvals, will involve 4m shares, and
the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund a
ADollars 67m dividend payment to Bridge Oil itself. After the flotation, it
is estimated that around 28.57 per cent of Bridge Oil (USA) will be owned by
the general public; 10 per cent by Santa Fe; and the remaining 61.43 per
cent by the parent Bridge Oil company.
Bridge Oil became involved in the US petroleum industry in 1981, expanding
in the late-1980s. In January 1990, it spent ADollars 147m on a package of
producing properties from USX Corporation.

<TEXT>
Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), the power station interests spun
off by Hong Kong property and infrastructure group Hopewell Holdings,
yesterday gave investors a paper profit of 20 per cent on its stock market
debut.
CEPA, which was sold off at HKDollars 12.50 a share in a combined HKDollars
5.94bn (USDollars 769m) offering, closed yesterday at HKDollars 15.
The stock accounted for 13.60 per cent of yesterday's activity on the Hong
Kong market, with HKDollars 1.08bn worth of shares changing hands.
Brokers attributed the 20 per cent one-day rise in CEPA's share price to
strong overseas institutional buying.
Stocks generally performed strongly in Hong Kong yesterday, with the Hang
Seng Index swelling 3.29 per cent to 9,609.69 on the back of a healthy
HKDollars 7.9bn turn-over.
CEPA hopes to cash in on huge forecast demand for electric power in Asia
through its plans to construct and operate power stations in China and the
Philippines. Big earnings, however, from these projects will not accrue to
CEPA until 1998.
Due to the lag in large scale earnings coming on stream, CEPA came on to the
market on a price-earnings multiple of around 47 times 1994 earnings,
compared with the Hong Kong market's overall rating of around 13 times.
CEPA is forecasting a profit for the 12 months to June 30, 1994, of
HKDollars 208m.
The issue was split into two tranches: a HKDollars 1.17bn public offering
and a HKDollars 4.77bn placement.
Both were heavily oversubscribed.

Castrol, the UK-based lubricants multinational, has established a Bt45m
(Dollars 1.7m) technology centre in Thailand to support Asia's fast-growing
lubricants markets, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok.
Castrol profits in Asia have been growing at more than 10 per cent a year
and the region now accounts for more than a fifth of Castrol's worldwide
profits. Castrol Thailand already ranks sixth among the group's affiliates
and could soon be more profitable than Castrol UK, company executives say.
The new building is Castrol's first major technical centre to specialise in
motorcycle lubricant research outside the UK.
'The Thai motorcycle market is showing a steady incline, but the development
of more efficient two-stroke lubricants is becoming more vital,' said Mr
Philip Prescott Beasley, technical director of Castrol Thailand.
Thailand has some 7m motorcycles and more than 1m cars. Castrol, which has
more than 20 per cent of the automotive business in Thailand, has found many
customers stay loyal to their brand when they move from motorcycle to car.

A consortium of Filipino and Singaporean interests has won the bid for the
Philippine government's majority holdings in Philippine Shipyard and
Engineering Corporation (Philseco), a ship-repair company based in the Subic
industrial zone, writes Jose Galang in Manila.
JG Summit Holdings Inc., a major Philippine group with diversified
investments, owns 60 per cent of the winning bloc, with the remainder
divided equally between two Singapore-based shipping companies, Jurong
Shipyard and Sembawang Holdings.
The winning group offered a bid of 2.03bn pesos (Dollars 72m) for an 87.7
per cent control of Philseco, part of the government's total holdings of
97.4 per cent in the company.
Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan owns 2.6 per cent. It has, under the
rules of the bidding, a month to top yesterday's bid by 5 per cent or the JG
Summit group will formally clinch it.

Taiwan has moved closer to production of its own car engines to supplant
components imported from Japan, writes John Griffiths in London.
The first test engines have been run at the Norfolk, eastern England,
headquarters of Lotus Engineering, under a contract which aims to bring the
engines into commercial production by 1997.
The contract provides for development work and technology transfer by Lotus
to the Taiwan government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute. It
is said by Lotus, which was sold by General Motors to Bugatti of Italy
earlier this year, to be worth several million pounds over its two-year
life.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Moody's lowers debt ratings of
Daiwa Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, has lowered the debt
ratings of Daiwa Bank, a Japanese commercial bank, due to prospects of
deteriorating profits from its acquisition of Cosmo Securities and its loan
exposure to the collapsed Muramoto Construction.
The agency lowered Daiwa's long-term rating to A3 from A1 and its short-term
rating to Prime 2 from Prime 1.
Daiwa became the first Japanese bank to acquire a brokerage subsidiary when
it bailed out Cosmo, a financially troubled second-tier stockbroker, last
August.
Moody's said while the controversial purchase would provide the bank with a
competitive advantage in entering the securities business on the long run,
the cost of the debt-funded acquisition would be a burden in the
intermediate term.
Daiwa was one of the leading creditors of Muramoto, which filed for court
protection with debts of up to Y590bn (Dollars 5.51bn) last month.
Moody's said Daiwa has 'considerable exposure to Muramoto' and expects the
cost of carrying significant non-performing assets, coupled with the
additional provision and write-off requirements, will continue to depress
the bank's earnings.
The problems come as Daiwa's earnings are being squeezed by the growing use
of high-cost funds from trust accounts to maintain competitive yields on its
trust products leading to lower net interest margins. In addition, its
commission-based profits from discretionary asset management services and
real estate brokerage remain vulnerable to volatile market conditions.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: South African company removes
its veil - Mobil divestment Engen is planning its brave new future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Appeals for foreign investment have replaced demands for divestment in the
lexicon of most black politicians in South Africa. But some strategic
sectors of the South African economy, such as its sprawling defence industry
and oil companies, have stayed shrouded in secrecy even as the political
process opened up.
That veil is now lifting, with international investors being able to assess
the long-term viability of some of South Africa's largest companies.
Politics, however, still exert a strong influence over the future strategy
of many such companies, including Engen, the country's biggest oil company,
which was created by the divestment in 1989 of Mobil Oil's South African
subsidiary. Unlike other divestments, in which the foreign parent company
retained the right to re-acquire its South African assets, the break with
Mobil was a 'clean one', according to Mr Rob Angel, chief executive.
That, combined with Engen's unbundling last month from Gencor, the
industrial and mining group that bought Mobil's assets, has given Mr Angel a
free hand. But the absence of international support means the company is
subject to domestic constraints, such as a foreign currency shortage, which
act as a brake on its ambitions.
Engen, which will get the bulk of its Dollars 2.4bn estimated turnover this
year from oil refining and marketing in South Africa and neighbouring
countries, is keen to use its new-found freedom to add international
upstream production to its domestic downstream business. It is also keen to
secure a London listing, although such a move will have wait until after
next April's election.
Greater access to foreign exchange is crucial if Engen is to realise its
goal to source 50 per cent of its crude oil needs from its own reserves
within 10 years. Mr Chris Sloan, an analyst at Johannesburg stockbrokers
Ferguson Brothers, says the lack of foreign exchange is one reason why Engen
has 'not been very successful' in its early exploration efforts. 'It means
they can't go for the highest quality exploration opportunities.'
Mr Angel concedes that Engen has had to pass up acquisition opportunities
because of currency restrictions. Its exploration activities are focused on
west Africa, where it shares licences with big multi-national oil companies
in Angola, Gabon and Namibia. It has a 2.2 per cent share of the Alba field
in the North Sea, as well as a small holding in the Britannia gas field and
a 10 per cent share in the Bukha gas condensate development off Oman. The
company is looking to buy, although it is likely to remain on a small scale
until it has greater access to hard currency.
Acquisitions are also likely in the downstream side of the business in
Africa, says Mr Angel, who wants Engen to have a 'leadership role' in
exporting and distributing refined products to the sub-Saharan market.
That goal is probably attainable, according to Mr Sloan, who says one legacy
of sanctions is the highly efficient refineries which the government
encouraged oil companies to build. Engen's main Durban refinery has been
subject to a number of upgrades which will boost its capacity to 105,000
barrels a day. That will allow it to capitalise on growing demand in Africa
north of the Limpopo river, which forms the border with Zimbabwe, and to
which the company's exports have risen from 1.9m barrels in 1991 to 5.7m
barrels this year.
Deregulation in South Africa's refining and retail market is likely to pose
the biggest challenge to Engen's fortunes. 'There is an increasingly public
and political debate over the oil industry,' says one Cape Town-based
industry analyst, who believes the issue is likely to be left for a new
government.
Full deregulation of the market is unlikely, but the formula used by the
government to set wholesale and retail prices will probably be replaced by a
mechanism 'which more accurately reflects world prices', says Mr Sloan.
Mr Angel believes deregulation will allow Engen to close some of the low
volume units among its 1,500 petrol stations without undermining its 26 per
cent market share.
But deregulation is also likely to create a new retail competitor. Sasol,
the synthetic oil from coal company that provides 45 per cent of the
country's petrol, is keen to enter the retail market with its own service
stations. At present Sasol is limited to a single pump at the stations of
other companies.
The government-set floor price for Sasol is Dollars 23 a barrel, compared
with current world oil prices of Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel. A new
government will be under financial pressures to reduce the protection that
Sasol receives, but it will probably hesitate to remove it altogether
because of the drastic effect such a step would have on employment at the
vast Sasol plants and the coal mines which supply them.
The prospect of much fiercer domestic competition and Engen's heavy exposure
to refining and marketing lies behind the drive to secure its own sources of
crude oil, according to analysts, as a strong production base would allow it
to benefit from any increase in crude oil prices. But Mr Angel concedes that
only a return to economic growth in South Africa can underpin the company's
longer-term performance.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Brazil's privatisation plans
suffer setback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Brazil's privatisation programme was set back yesterday by the failure to
sell the petrochemical company Petroquimica Uniao, known as PQU. Only 5.07m
of the 50m plus one voting shares, a controlling stake, were bought at
auction on the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange because of a dispute over
government prices for petrochemical naphtha, PQU's main raw material.
The privatisation had already been postponed five times, due to
disagreements over the sale structure and the naphtha dispute. It looks
unlikely that the government will manage to sell a further 32.5m shares,
which would total 75 per cent of the offer, by this afternoon's deadline. If
75 per cent of the offer is not sold, the privatisation auction will be
ruled invalid.
A failure of the sale is expected to slow down the government's
privatisation programme. Four petrochemicals companies have been privatised
since April 1992 and others are planned. The Copene petrochemicals complex
in the north-east Bahia region is among the largest potential
privatisations.
The main prospective buyer for PQU has been a consortium including Union
Carbide and Polibrasil, some of PQU's main customers.
Despite negotiations with the government's privatisation committee, they are
still not satisfied with the price formula fixed by the government for
naphtha, which is supplied to PQU by Petrobras, the federally-controlled oil
company.
The controlling stake is being given up by Petroquisa, a Petrobras
subsidiary. The minimum sale price for the stake is Dollars 340m. The
Odebrecht group, which announced last week it would not be bidding, has a
minority share in the holding company Unipar, which owns 29 per cent of PQU.
PQU is the basic supplier for chemicals companies in the Cubatao area near
Sao Paulo and is the oldest of its kind in Brazil. The company expects sales
of Dollars 450m this year.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bronfmans sell Seagram shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Canadian members of the Bronfman family, through the Charles Bronfman
trust, have sold 3.7m Seagram shares on the New York stock market for nearly
USDollars 100m.
The sale reduces the trust's holding from 62m shares to 58m shares or almost
16 per cent. Three Bronfman family trusts control Seagram, one of the
world's top drinks groups.
Mr Michel Boucher, vice-president of Claridge, the Montreal-based holding
company for the Charles Bronfman group, said the sale was 'part of the
family's financial planning'.
The shares included a block of 3.28m cross-traded by Goldman Sachs
yesterday. Mr Boucher said he was unaware of the buyers of the Seagram
block. Seagram shares fell about 3 per cent following the block trade.
The stock sale came several days after Seagram reported a third-quarter loss
of 27 US cents a share due to a 64 cents special charge, Seagram's share of
a USDollars 1.3bn write-down by Du Pont. Seagram holds 24.3 per cent of the
chemicals giant.
In New York, Seagram spokesman Mr Chris Tofalli said the sale was made for
personal reasons. 'It happens from time to time but such sales are not that
frequent.'
Charles Bronfman is co-chairman of Seagram. His elder brother, Edgar, of New
York, is chairman and his son, Edgar Bronfman Jr, took over as Seagram
president several years ago to reorganise the worldwide group.

CellPro and Corange, two international biotechnology companies, have formed
an alliance under which Corange will pay up to Dollars 220m for a 15 per
cent stake in CellPro and rights to certain products.
Bermuda-based Corange, parent of Boehringer Mannheim and De Puy, is the
world's second largest producer of in-vitro diagnostic products.
CellPro, based in Bothwell, Washington, specialises in cell-selection
systems for use in therapeutic, diagnostic and research applications.
The equity agreement provides for Corange to invest Dollars 110m in CellPro
by buying new shares in the company in two tranches over the next 15 months.
The agreement will leave it holding approximately 15 per cent of the
company's equity.
Under separate agreements, Corange will acquire certain rights to
therapeutic and diagnostic products being developed by CellPro in return for
a signing fee of Dollars 10m, contributions to research and development of
up to Dollars 55m, and milestone payments of up to Dollars 45m.
One agreement will provide for CellPro and Corange jointly to develop and
market stem cell-selection products for therapeutic applications outside
North America, and to share profits.

<TEXT>
CBS expects its network broadcast revenues to rise by 5 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1993, said Mr David Poltrack, senior vice-president of
planning and research for the US group, Reuter reports from New York.
At a conference, Mr Poltrack said he expected network revenue for all of
1994 to grow by 4 per cent to 5 per cent. He cited three factors for the
1994 forecast: a strong market for scatter advertising, expected growth of
15 per cent in the audience for late-night programming, and added revenues
in the first quarter from the Winter Olympics.
The scatter market is for advertising sold currently as opposed to before a
season begins.
Mr Poltrack also estimated that revenues for the Big Three TV networks would
rise 6 to 7 per cent in 1994, 'with more upside than downside to that
forecast.'
He said his forecast did not include Fox Network, a unit of News Corp.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Mellon Bank sees a mutual
advantage - Richard Waters looks at the background to the US bank's takeover
bid for Dreyfus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was only a limited time that US banks could have afforded to stand
aside from the boom in the mutual fund business.
The twin forces of rising stock and bond markets and falling short-term
interest rates have sucked cash out of bank deposits: at current growth
rates, mutual fund assets will exceed bank deposits in the US before the end
of the decade.
The near-Dollars 2,000bn that Americans have in mutual funds is already
roughly equal to 80 per cent of the cash they have in the bank.
Banks which have tried to break their way into the business have made rapid
progress in the past year, but from a very low base.
In the middle of this year, PNC Bank and BankAmerica each had around Dollars
20bn in assets under management, compared with Dollars 10bn at NationsBank
and Dollars 5bn at Chase Manhattan, according to research by Lipper
Analytical Services.
In all, banks account for only an estimated 8 per cent of the total mutual
fund business.
Faced with such a position, a bank takeover of a mutual fund group seemed
likely before long.
Most commercial banks' shares are trading at high levels after the recovery
of the past year, even after the correction in bank stocks since October.
This has made it possible for banks to contemplate using their own paper to
buy fund groups without facing a big earnings dilution, even at a time when
the mutual fund industry is at a peak.
Even so, Mellon predicts its earnings per share growth will be held back by
9 per cent next year as a result of the acquisition.
If completed, Mellon's acquisition of Dreyfus, which accounts for 4 per cent
of the mutual funds business, will catapult it ahead of other banks.
It could also hasten a rush by others to buy a stake in the fund industry -
though there is a shortage of publicly-held funds groups to target.
Most of the leading companies are either privatively-held - like Fidelity
Investments, the industry leader with Dollars 226bn under management at the
end of October (up 35 per cent on a year before) - or part of brokerage
groups.
Merrill Lynch, with Dollars 116bn, ranks third, behind the privately-held
Vanguard Group.
This helps in part to explain Mellon's choice of Dreyfus, which has missed
out on the mutual fund explosion over the past year.
Dreyfus made its name in the 1970s with an aggressive push into money-market
funds, a bias that has remained. Around 44 per cent of its fund assets are
in short-term money markets, compared with an industry norm of only some 25
per cent.
As investors have rushed out of money market instruments and into long-term
equity and bond funds, Dreyfus has scrambled to catch up.
But its assets under management at the end of October had fallen to Dollars
76.7bn from Dollars 81.2bn a year before, according to figures compiled by
the Investment Company Institute.
If US interest rates increase faster than the modest rise predicted by many
market analysts for the first quarter of next year, then Dreyfus' fortunes
could change quickly - and Mellon's purchase would look a lot smarter.
Mr Howard Stein, Dreyfus chairman and chief executive, has been consistently
cautious about the stock market's boom.
It is a policy that was proved correct in September 1987 when, in an
interview with Forbes magazine, he explained his reasons for not investing
Dreyfus' own money in buying investment firms. 'Everything goes full
circle,' he warned then.
For Mellon, meanwhile, the Dreyfus deal represents the clearest sign yet
that the Pittsburgh-based bank is emerging strongly from the credit problems
which threatened to engulf it at the end of the 1980s.
Under chairman Mr Frank Cahouet, Mellon has made a bold move into fee-based
businesses far removed from its traditional commercial lending base. Earlier
this year, it acquired the Boston Company from Shearson, making it one of
the US's largest custodians. The Dreyfus deal will take its assets under
management to Dollars 215bn.
Its reliance on net interest income will fall still further: after the deal,
52 per cent of revenues will come from fee-based businesses, Mellon says.
The Mellon move is likely to intensify the interest of regulators and other
policy makers in the implications of a full-scale bank invasion of the
mutual fund business.
Mr David Hale, an analyst at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, questions
whether 'the US will create a new form of universal banking in which banks
supply the corporate sector with equity and long-term debt financing through
new mutual fund affiliates, not just their traditional lending departments'.
That would throw open again the question of how the banks are regulated, and
by whom - at just the time when the Clinton administration has begun a
tentative initiative to unify the fragmented regulatory framework that
already applies to commercial banks.

A consortium led by Accor, the French hotel group, has completed a Dollars
57m purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Pannonia, Hungary's main mid-market
hotel chain, writes Nicholas Denton from Budapest.
The deal's most striking provision is that Pannonia will become Accor's
vehicle for expansion in the southern tier of eastern Europe, holding the
exclusive right to Accor brands such as Novotel and Sofitel.
In addition to the purchase price, Accor has undertaken that a privatised
Pannonia will invest a further Dollars 30m for renovation of the Hungarian
company's portfolio of 33 hotels.
Hungary's State Property Agency, the privatisation authority which conducted
the disposal of state-owned Pannonia, plans to float its residual
shareholding on the Budapest stock exchange in the course of 1994.

Iktisat Bankasi, the Turkish trade finance bank controlled by Mr Erol Aksoy,

writes John Murray-Brown from Ankara.
An issue of up to 10 per cent of its share capital is being considered as Mr
Aksoy looked to raise funds to finance his media businesses.
Iktisat, which is a specialist trade finance bank, reported profits of
TL165bn (Dollars 12.2m) in 1992 on assets of TL5,874bn.
The sale of a 10 per cent stake would raise about Dollars 30m, the bank
said.
Mr Aksoy owns 45 per cent of Iktisat while his family-controlled holding
company owns a further 50 per cent.

<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the French insurance group, warns that
second-half profits are likely to be below those of the first half due to
the impact of the economic recession and freak weather conditions in France,
writes Alice Rawsthorn from Paris.
Mr Michel Albert, chairman, said the 1993 results 'would definitely be less
than double' the outcome in the first half when it made static net profits
of FFr1.41bn (Dollars 241m).
However, Mr Albert stressed that he was not overly concerned about the
outcome for the full financial year. He said he was reasonably optimistic
about AGF's performance in spite of the tough economic environment.
AGF, which is a candidate for privatisation and had until recently been less
badly affected by the French recession than its competitors, made net
profits of FFr1.5bn on consolidated sales of FFr59bn in 1992.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Vereinsbank improves 27% in
first 10 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bayerische Vereinsbank yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in operating
profits for the first 10 months of this year and promised shareholders a
DM16 dividend for 1993, up DM3 on 1992.
The Munich-based banking group said operating earnings, after allowing for a
14 per cent increase in loan risk provisions to DM772m (Dollars 454m),
climbed to DM992m.
Mr Albrecht Schmidt, chairman, said most of the improvement stemmed from a
13 per cent rise in net commission income to DM859m and earnings from
financial transactions which more than doubled compared with the same period
in 1992 to DM241m.
He attributed a 12 per cent jump in interest income to DM3bn to strong
growth in property financing. Mr Schmidt said most of the increase in risk
provisions was to cover the needs of the domestic credit business. Country
risks played a subordinate role, he said.
In general, there were no grounds for less caution on the risks front, he
added, Experience showed that the impact of recession on the banking sector
was usually delayed.
Countering between-the-lines charges in the media that banks benefited from
economic slumps, he said they functioned like air-bags. 'They need good
profits to cushion their customers from the effects of recession,' he added.
With the aim of 'dressing warmly' in the light of increasing risks and
stronger competition, the bank intended to increase its capital base through
a 1-8 rights issue.
Details would be decided later this month, he said.
Half of the planned dividend increase was a bonus to mark the bank's 125th
anniversary, Mr Schmidt noted. The rest was compensation for the effects of
new corporate taxation laws to be introduced on January 1, which would leave
domestic shareholders disadvantaged if the payout were left unchanged.

Higher results in the Netherlands and Portugal helped Ahold, the Dutch-based
food retailer, overcome lower earnings in the US to report a 9.3 per cent
increase in third-quarter net profit.
Net profit rose to Fl 72.9m (Dollars 38.4m) in the quarter from Fl 66.7m a
year earlier, on sales up nearly 35 per cent at Fl 6.2bn. The strong sales
increase was due mainly to new consolidations and the translation effects of
the higher dollar.
Ahold, whose annual sales are roughly evenly split between the US and
Europe, said operating profit in the US slipped to Dollars 31.9m from
Dollars 37.6m, reflecting both the one-off costs of changing the format of
Edwards, one of its five US supermarket chains, as well as the fierce
competition facing its Finast Ohio operations.
In the Netherlands, where Ahold's Albert Heijn chain is the national leader,
operating profit rose to Fl 69.7m from Fl 51.4m, an increase of 35.6 per
cent. When corrected for the consolidation of Schuitema, a majority-owned
wholesaler, and Jamin, a Dutch confectionery chain, the rise in the
Netherlands is 16.5 per cent.
In other European countries, operating results swung into a profit of Fl 15m
from a loss of Fl 2.5m, due almost entirely to improvements in Portugal,
where Ahold has expanded rapidly in recent years.
Overall, operating profit in the quarter rose by 30.5 per cent to Fl 144.3m.
Net profit increased at a lower rate because of higher financial expenses
and taxes linked to the new consolidations and acquisitions.
The third-quarter result takes net profit for the first nine months to Fl
245.3m, an 11.4 per cent increase.

Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the leading suppliers of small gold bars
to the retail market, has launched a new line of bars designed to foil the
forger and tamperer, and attract new custom to the lacklustre gold trade.
The bars feature a highly complex, multi-coloured hologram-like pattern on
one face. The recently developed technology, called kinegram, is used on
some banknotes and security documents and is virtually impossible to copy.
The kinegram is very sensitive to disturbance. Anyone attempting to take
some of the gold out of a small bar and substitute tungsten or another
similarly dense metal would cause a distortion to the pattern that would be
visible to the naked eye.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Netas sale tempts foreign
investors - The Turkish group hopes to raise Dollars 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International investors are being offered a chance to bid for an 18 per cent
stake in Northern Electrik Telekomminkasyon (Netas), the Turkish
telecommunications group which is part of the Northern Telecom of Canada.
The sales syndicate is being led by Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank.
It includes Salomon Bros, Morgan Stanley, James Capel, and UBS of
Switzerland. The sale of the shareholding is expected to raise Dollars 60m.
Telecommunications is one of Turkey's fastest growing industries. Turkey
increased the number of lines by 163 per cent between 1986-91. Public and
private investments in the sector are running at about Dollars 2bn a year.
Today, for every 100 Turks, 16 have access to a telephone. By 1996, this is
expected to rise to about 30 per hundred.
The share sale will have a big impact on the direction of Turkey's
privatisation effort. Turkey is grappling with the problems of how to
dispose of its large state-owned monopolies, with advisers due to be
appointed on the sale of both Petrol Ofisi, the petroleum retail company and
Tupras, the state-owned refineries group.
Netas was set up as a joint venture between PTT, Turkey's state post and
telecommunications monopoly and Northern Telecom, to manufacture switches
and exchanges for the national network.
The company is Turkey's largest telecommunications manufacturer. Netas
accounts for more than 50 per cent of the local switchgear market, which in
turn comprises 60 per cent of the company's total sales - which in 1992
totalled Dollars 270m.
However, there is some concern at the extent to which the the company is
dependent on government payments for its revenue flows. About 80 per cent of
earnings represent local revenues, although that proportion is falling, the
company says.
Mr Tanju Argun, the Netas managing director, estimates the 1993 sales figure
at Dollars 300m, with exports accounting for Dollars 30m. By 1996, the
company expects half its revenues to come from non-government turnover,
mostly exports.
The company has been in the vanguard of Turkish telecommunications expansion
in central Asia. Netas installed Northern Telecom's DMS public exchange in
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The company has three joint
ventures in the Russian Federation to manufacture the DRX rural digital
switch, its own design.
Netas plans to exploit the growing market in terrestrial and cable
television transmission systems, following the scrapping in June of the
state television monopoly. There are now 14 channels. The only blight was
when the company failed to win the PTT tender to install a GSM cellular
telephone network, the pan-European digital standard which will link Turkey
with other European users.
The PTT split the contract, awarding to two separate consortia, one led by
Eriksson of Sweden, another by Alcatel of France.
In February, Northern Telecom paid Dollars 26m for a 20 per cent stake in
Netas formerly owned by the government, bringing its shareholding to 51 per
cent. The Turkish armed forces fund retains a 15 per cent stake, while the
PTT charitable foundation owns 3 per cent.
In addition, in March the government offered a further 20 per cent by
initial public offering, although subscriptions were received for only 35
per cent of the issue.
Turkish brokers expect Kleinwort to price the current deal at a discount of
between 5 per cent and 10 per cent to the stock market. Netas is trading at
about TL45,000 compared with the March offer price of TL8,250.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft denies
problems as shares tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft reacted angrily yesterday after a newspaper report
alluding to liquidity problems wiped almost 12 per cent off the group's
share price on the Frankfurt stock exchange.
The stock tumbled DM46 on the day, picking up only marginally after the
company denied the story.
Officials at the diversified metals, mining and industrial engineering group
suggested insiders might have been responsible for reports of liquidity
problems allegedly arising from speculation in US oil futures.
Denying any difficulties, the company suggested the report, in the respected
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, might not have appeared simply by chance.
However, it was not sensible to speculate over possible sources or reasons,
he said.
In a formal statement the company said its US subsidiary, MG Corp had did
not speculate in oil futures on Nymex, the New York Mercantile Exchange. It
was normal to hedge and cover delivery contracts to its customers on Nymex
to avoid taking open positions, Metallgesellschaft said.
When world oil prices were falling, additional payments had to be made on
account, and MG Corp had always paid them promptly.
These payments had lately turned out to be higher than expected. The company
said suggestions that the company had had to find up to DM3bn (Dollars
1.8bn) at short notice were 'rubbish'.
'In order to be prepared for a further possible fall in the oil price,
Metallgesellschaft has agreed to adapt its financing framework agreement
with Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank,' the company said.
The deal was done after Nymex prices for oil for January delivery hit a
five-year low in the latter part of last week. MG Corp has about 500 large
customers for oil products in the US and runs a fleet of about 200 delivery
trucks.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the group's chairman, said last week that MG did not
have any liquidity problems and was the subject of a whispering campaign.
Mr Schimmelbusch warned recently that the group might omit its dividend for
the year to the end of September when it fell into a pre-tax loss of DM347m
after the previous year's DM245m profit.
However, he said he was confident of a return to the black in the current
year.
The continued sell-off of non-core businesses was expected to yield a DM600m
book profit in 1993-94, and results would be helped by workforce reductions
and other measures designed to cut costs by DM1.1bn in the three years to
1995.

losses on disposals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite difficult trading, Marling Industries, the industrial textiles
company, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 659,000 to Pounds 910,000
in the six months to end-September.
The result was struck after losses of Pounds 485,000 on disposal of
discontinued operations.
Turnover was Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 38.8m), including Pounds 4.04m (Pounds
13.6m) from discontinued activities. Earnings per share fell from 0.56p to
0.29p following the rights issue in July and there is an interim dividend
this time of 0.2p. In the period, the company spent Pounds 4m acquiring
Muller Group in Germany and Albert Green.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: EDP slips to Pounds 4.67m as interest
income falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronic Data Processing, the Sheffield-based computer software and
services group, reported slightly lower full year profits reflecting a
decline in net interest income.
Pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 slipped to Pounds 4.67m,
compared with Pounds 4.88m, as net interest receivable declined to Pounds
563,000 (Pounds 784,000).
Earnings per share were 35.14p (38.4p), partly reflecting a higher tax rate,
but the proposed final dividend is increased to 3.5p, making a total of 5.5p
(5.1p). The group also plans a 2-for-1 scrip issue.
Turnover fell to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15.5m), including Pounds 1.1m from
last November's US acquisitions. The fall reflected the continued sharp
decline in computer equipment prices.
Recurring service revenues, including the licensing of the group's Merchant
software package, continued to run at about Pounds 8m a year while system
and solution sales fell from Pounds 6.64m to Pounds 5.8m.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 4.11m (Pounds 4.09m) despite a Pounds
540,000 increase in research and development expenditure to Pounds 1.41m.
The US acquisitions, Via Systems and Open, incurred a Pounds 106,000 loss,
but are expected to break even this year.
Mr Michael Heller, chairman, said the most significant development was the
introduction of UniVision, an advanced database management system.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reorganised Leigh 24% up at Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leigh Interests, the waste management company, said yesterday that a
wide-ranging business reorganisation helped lift pre-tax profits by 24 per
cent, from Pounds 4.08m to Pounds 5.06m, in the half year to September 30.
Turnover was up from Pounds 52.3m to Pounds 56.4m, following the company's
decision to reduce its dependence on waste disposal for the construction
industry, especially in the south of England.
Instead, it has targeted commercial waste - refuse from offices, shops and
factories - to build up an alternative customer base.
Mr Arthur Kent, finance director, said: 'We did rather badly because of the
recession in construction, but we've now restructured our landfill sites to
handle more commercial waste.'
The results, however, were held back by operating losses of Pounds 700,000
at two new waste plants in the Midlands, which were unable to operate at
full capacity because of manufacturers' faults.
The faults are due to be repaired in the second half.
Operating profits - up from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 6.78m - were also
affected by a 3 per cent fall in the volume of liquid wastes treated by the
company.
Mr Kent blamed the decline on the European Commission's decision to postpone
a new directive requiring the disposal of such waste at new treatment
plants.
Earnings per share increased to 5.5p (4.4p), while the interim dividend is
held at 2.46p.

Whitecroft, the Cheshire-based textiles, lighting, building products and
medical cotton fibre group, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.82m in the
six months to September 30, a sharp turnround from interim losses of Pounds
29.3m last time, which increased to Pounds 41.8m for the full year.
The directors are, nevertheless, not declaring an interim dividend,
preferring to wait for the year-end to ensure improvement is sustained. The
shares closed at 77p, up 5p.
The turnround was largely the result of nearly Pounds 40m of property
write-downs and other provisions distorting the 1992-93 figures, compared
with only Pounds 600,000 this time for closure of a lossmaking subsidiary.
However, operating profits trebled to Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 870,000) and were
nearly double the full year's Pounds 1.36m. This was in spite of a 5 per
cent drop in turnover to Pounds 60.8m (Pounds 64m) for the half-year.
Earnings per share of 3.6p compared with losses of 68.2p last time and 94.5p
for the year. Net tangible assets per share were 52.4p, a drop from 81.9p a
year ago, but an improvement on the last full year's 48.6p.
Whitecroft is now run by Mr Mike Derbyshire, chief executive, formerly of
Norcros, and Mr Martyn Ellis, who joined as finance director from Inchcape
this year.
The non-executive chairman is Mr David Kendall, chairman of Bunzl. He
succeeded Mr Peter Goold, who resigned as executive chairman last March.
Whitecroft appears now to have scraped through the recession by disengaging
from property, housebuilding and building materials.
Core products include lighting systems, book-cloth for passports, fire doors
and cotton wool. A third of output is exported, with demand growing in
eastern Europe for street lighting, passports, tampons and better safety
equipment.
Mr Derbyshire said yesterday: 'All our property is beginning to move and can
be viewed as pile of cash waiting to be released.' Gearing at the end of
October was 119 per cent, with borrowings down to Pounds 26m against Pounds
43m in January.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: A prescription for future growth - Glaxo
sets great store on developing its own products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive, spent most of his
Tuesday afternoon in the Sorcerer's Room of the elegant Thameside hotel, the
Savoy.
His object was to explain to the media, for the first time in nearly two
years, the progress of the pipeline of new products with which Glaxo will
conjure its future.
The company, Europe's largest drugs group and challenger for the world's top
position currently held by Merck of the US, also offered a round-up of the
commercial environment and the prospects for its drugs.
The presentation's emphasis on research and development was significant,
however. The group was not going to be seduced by diversification, said Dr
Sykes. He has rejected strategies adopted by other groups such as worldwide
rationalisation, mergers, and joint ventures and mergers for generic and
over-the-counter non-prescription businesses.
Instead, Glaxo has adopted a strategy of concentrating on patented
prescription medicines in spite of an increasingly difficult environment for
drugs.
The group's strategy was to focus rather than dissipate its energies, said
Dr Sykes. It planned to maximise sales of established drugs such as Zantac,
the anti-ulcer treatment; bring new and innovative drugs to market; bring
these products to market fast on a global basis; and invest in developing
markets.
The radical strategic departure adopted by Merck of vertical integration
through the Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) acquisition of Medco Containment, a
mail order company, was also dismissed by Dr Sykes. 'The concept is good,
it's doubtful whether it was worth what Merck paid for it. There are other
ways of achieving the same ends with less expense,' he claimed.
Meanwhile, Glaxo is adopting a flexible approach to change. Dr Sykes
stressed the importance of reacting to local conditions. This commitment to
local autonomy within a framework of central strategic direction was also
stressed in the group's annual report this year, and was in sharp contrast
to the managerial style of Dr Ernest Mario, Dr Sykes's predecessor, who was
sacked last March.
Dr Mario had an extremely detailed grasp of local conditions and is
understood to have meddled in the activities of certain subsidiaries.
Key to the group's ability to maximise revenues remains its ability to
increase revenues from Zantac, the best-selling medicine of all time with
sales last financial year of Pounds 2.2bn.
Dr Sykes was dismissive of the threat posed to the drug through the
eradication of a bacterium, helicobacter pylori, associated with ulcers.
Most patients were effectively treated with Zantac maintenance therapy said
Dr Sykes. A few patients taking the drug relapsed, and for these it was a
good idea to use a combination of drugs to eradicate HP, he agreed.
'But if you eradicate HP in everybody who comes into the surgery with
ulcers, it will work in anything between 10 per cent and 70 per cent of
patients. That's playing Russian roulette because half of those people are
going to relapse and 10 per cent will perforate, and of those 5 per cent
will die. You can't gamble like that,' he argued.
The main threat to Zantac remained generic competition. The US patents of
Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's drug and one of Zantac's main competitors,
expire next year, but Dr Sykes did not expect it to have a big impact.
'There's no direct relationship between price and usage. Service, volume
discounts and what other drugs you offer are equally important,' said Dr
Sykes.
Meanwhile, Glaxo plans to drive growth through its new products, Imigran,
the migraine treatment, Zofran, an anti-nausea drug, and Serevent, an asthma
medicine.
Glaxo's increasing management flexibility has been demonstrated by its
decision to launch low-dose versions of Imigran, following criticisms of the
high price of the 100mg version. Dr Sykes said the move to launch 25mg and
50mg doses would help expand the market for those with mild migraines and,
although not particularly driven by criticisms of price, the decision would
help reduce them.
Meanwhile, analysts believe the development pipeline looks rich, with few
'me-too' products. There are more compounds in exploratory development - 16
 -than ever before.
Zofran, also known as ondansetron, was as effective as Warner-Lambert's
Cognex for the treatment of Alzheimer's symptoms and was far safer, said Dr
Sykes. He hoped it would be filed by early 1995.
Also highlighted by Dr Sykes was GR92132X, a treatment for non-insulin
dependent diabetics. Glaxo's HIV-treatment, 3TC, also known as lamivudine,
looks effective in hepatitis B, a huge killer in the developing world, he
said.
Ranitidine bismuth citrate could become important for HP eradication when
used with antibiotics. Remifentanil, an injectable anaesthetic, was a
sleeper, capable of becoming an important drug, he quipped.
Given the company's full pipeline, and its clear strategy based on patented
prescription medicines, Dr Sykes, Glaxo's sorcerer-in-chief, has staked the
group's future on its ability to create and market new drugs. Glaxo's
shareholders must now hope the sorcerer's strategy does not turn out to be
hocus-pocus.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: B&amp;C creditors can expect at least 21p in
the pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors to British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial services conglomerate
that collapsed in 1990, will receive at least 21p in the pound, according to
a report of the administrators to the company.
If the outcome of several outstanding legal actions is successful, unsecured
creditors may receive more than twice that figure, administrators from
accountants Ernst &amp; Young believe.
Total payments to creditors to date have totalled 15p in the pound,
including a fourth dividend of 2p paid out last month. The administrators'
costs are Pounds 14.7m, with a further Pounds 26m in legal fees.
Realisations to date now total nearly Pounds 1bn including investment income
of Pounds 100m, against distributions of Pounds 702m, split between B&amp;C, and
its finance (BCFG), merchant banking (BCMB) and property arms.
The current projected returns are 21p to creditors of B&amp;C, 29p to BCFG and
100p in the pound to BCMB. The bankers to the group will receive 50p in the
pound because they are all creditors to both B&amp;C and BCFG.
These could be increased substantially by possible litigation against the
directors and professional advisers to Atlantic Computers, the leasing
company acquired by B&amp;C.
In a letter to creditors at the end of last month, the joint administrators
say their investigations are nearly complete and they expect advice on
whether to proceed from leading counsel and solicitors 'during the next few
months'.
Any decision may be influenced by the conclusions of a report by inspectors
appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry to examine Atlantic, which
is now believed to have been completed.
Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the joint administrators, said yesterday: 'We are
invest-igating the position. No decision has been taken.'
B&amp;C won a Pounds 172m award against Samuel Montagu and Quadrex, following
the latter's failure to complete the purchase of the wholesale broking
division of Mercantile House, which was acquired by B&amp;C before it collapsed.
The money is now being held by the court, pending an appeal on both the
liability and size of damages which has been scheduled for January 1995.
The House of Lords is due to hear an appeal from the Inland Revenue against
a tax refund of Pounds 80m paid by B&amp;C, and which the court of appeal found
in the group's favour.
The money to be distributed may be increased by a further Pounds 164m if
legal action scheduled for January next year finds against preference
shareholders in Caledonia Investments, for which banks are suing B&amp;C for
breach of covenant.
There is also a dispute over Pounds 99m for which B&amp;C is suing its own
finance division.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cementone reverses into Multitrust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cementone, the specialist paints and building chemicals manufacturer, is
coming to the market through a reverse takeover of Multitrust, the property
investment company.
The transaction, involving a Pounds 2.8m rights issue and the disposal of
Multitrust's Pounds 3.2m investment portfolio, is expected to value
Cementone at up to Pounds 20m.
The company decided to follow the reversal route following a failed attempt
last year to expand by acquiring a rival supplier. Mr Alfred Baxendale,
managing director, said Cementone had persuaded its parent company, UB
International, owned by Mr Vijay Mallya, the Indian entrepreneur, that its
future growth depended on going public.
'Mr Mallya sees this as the best way forward. Without it growth might have
been restricted,' Mr Baxendale said.
Cash raised by the takeover, which is due to be completed by the end of
January, will be used to buy the freehold of the manufacturing plant and to
finance acquisitions.
In the year to December 31 1992, pre-tax profits almost doubled to Pounds
995,000 (Pounds 518,000) on flat turnover of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 17.3m).
Pro forma profits in the current year are expected to approach Pounds 1.5m.
Mr Kenneth Prenty, finance director, said Cementone's performance had
improved despite a 35 per cent contraction in the market for specialist
paints and building chemicals in the last three years.
The new board will be chaired by Mr Alan Clements, former group finance
director at ICI, with Mr Mallya as deputy. Mr Andrew Perloff, chairman of
Multitrust, will be a non-executive director.

Closure of its dry docks meant that Ugland International, the shipping
company formerly known as Bristol Channel Ship Repairers, turned in a loss
of Pounds 780,000 on turnover of Pounds 4,500 for the six months to
September 24.
That compared with a loss of Pounds 236,000 on turnover of Pounds 34,000
last time. Losses per share were 0.98p (0.3p).

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Tight controls help IWP to
IPounds 4.52m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IWP, the Irish industrial holding group, reported a 5 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from IPounds 4.31m to IPounds 4.52m (Pounds 4.3m) on
turnover up 4 per cent to IPounds 48.4m for the six months to September 30.
The company said that despite depressed consumer spending during the period,
especially in its main UK market, the core household products and packaging
divisions performed satisfactorily due to tight management control.
The small and unprofitable telecommunications division is to be disposed of
by the year-end.
Enhanced growth is anticipated in the full year, due to a first-time
contribution from Levendaal Beheer, the Dutch toiletries and household
products group, which IWP purchased last October in a complex IPounds 51.2m
cash and shares offer.
Mr Joe Moran, chief executive, said that in future almost 50 per cent of
profits would be sourced from the Netherlands division, which is expanding
into the German and east European markets, instead of from the UK at
present.
He said that a combined marketing and purchasing approach in the enlarged
group 'will bring results in 1994-95 rather than this year'. He said gearing
is expected to drop from the current 98 per cent to 85 per cent by year-end,
and 40-45 per cent within 12 months due to cash flow and the anticipated
expansion of the equity base.
Earnings per share were 12.11p (11.35p) and an interim dividend of 3.25p
(3p) is declared.
The company has also announced a series of board changes, including a
separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive. Mr Joe Moran,
formerly executive chairman, is now chief executive, while Mr Frank Plunkett
Dillon, a non-executive director and hitherto deputy chairman, becomes
chairman.
Two new non-executive directors join the board; Mr JWC Van de Veer, a
director of Levendaal and chairman of P&amp;C, the Dutch retail clothing group,
and Mr Patrick Dowling, a former deputy chief executive of Allied Irish
Banks. Mr Jim Stewart is resigning from the board for health reasons.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: King &amp; Shaxson in acquisition negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY RIMMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
King &amp; Shaxson Holdings, the banking, money broking and discounting concern,
turned in lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 761,908 for the six months to
October 31 1993, compared with Pounds 3.09m.
The directors also announced that discussions were taking place with a view
to acquiring Greig Middleton Holdings, the principal subsidiary of which is
a member of the Stock Exchange.
The consideration would be entirely in the form of K&amp;S shares or share
related consideration, involving the issue of up to 12m shares in total.
The main activities of Greig, a private concern, are investment management
and financial advice for clients, brokerage and research services for
institutions, and corporate finance.
On results, the directors explained that there were no changes in official
rates during the six months, whereas a year ago the group was able to
benefit 'from the exceptional turmoil surrounding the exit from the ERM'.
After tax of Pounds 252,975 (Pounds 1.03m) earnings per share were 2.7p,
well down from last time's 12.5p, while the interim dividend is unchanged at
4p.
Greig's accounts for the 53 weeks ended July 16 showed turnover of Pounds
19.8m and, following conversion of loan notes, would show pro forma pre-tax
profits of Pounds 3m and shareholders' funds at that date of Pounds 7m.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at Sheldon Jones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sheldon Jones, the USM-quoted pet food and garden products
company, fell 15p to 48p following the announcement of a rights issue, a
capital reconstruction and increased annual losses.
As a result of losses for the year to June 30, consolidated net assets had
fallen to Pounds 293,000 with net borrowings of Pounds 2.9m. The company
said net assets were set to fall further following the forecast of losses
for the six months to December 31.
In an underwritten 4-for-3 rights issue at 25p the company is raising a net
Pounds 1.35m. It is also redeeming its 12.5 per cent/13.5 per cent loan
stock mainly in exchange for new 7.5 per cent loan stock.
It is proposing to split the 25p shares into 5p ordinary and 20p deferred to
allow the elimination of the deficit on revenue reserves.
For the year to June 30 pre-tax losses were Pounds 3.27m (Pounds 1.28m),
mainly due to losses relating to the southern activities of the garden
products division, which has now been closed, the Topwood Timber business,
which has been sold, and the property disposal programme.
The company is now mainly involved in pet food, plus the northern activities
of the garden products side. It is intended to change the name to Pascoe's
Group, the year end to December 31 and to seek a full listing.
Turnover declined from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 14.9m including a lower
contribution of Pounds 6.56m (Pounds 7.49m) from discontinued activities.
Losses per share increased from 22.48p to 59.75p.
The pre-tax figure was after a provision for loss on discontinued activities
of Pounds 584,000 and provision against writing down of fixed assets of
Pounds 1.13m.

FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: NIE's Pounds 42.3m pleases City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Ireland Electricity yesterday pleased the market in its first
results since privatisation by announcing an 18.5 per cent rise to Pounds
42.3m in interim pre-tax profits and a dividend ahead 12.6 per cent at
3.39p.
Although the dividend increase was slightly below what most analysts expect
the regional electricity companies to pay on average in the current results
round, the City approved of the company's success in tackling its cost base.
Earnings per share for the six months to September 30 rose to 20.8p (17.9p).
Turnover of Pounds 206.2m (Pounds 188.4m) was helped by tariff increases of
6.6 per cent and a 2 per cent increase in units distributed (weather
corrected).
Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said Northern Ireland's economy had not
experienced the booms and troughs that other UK areas had been through in
recent years and he expected the economy to remain healthy in the second
half of the year.
NIE's sales will also be helped by current trends in prices of coal and oil
which generate all of the province's electricity. Mr Patrick Haren, chief
executive, said the company did not expect to experience the same kind of
pressure for next year's prices as it did for this year's.
The company's performance in the first half of the year was helped by a 7.3
per cent reduction in controllable operating costs. Mr Gordon Woodworth,
finance director, said Pounds 2.6m, or 8 per cent, had been taken off
salaries and employee related costs.
The company reduced its payroll number from 3,413 in September 1992 to 3,157
this September and has set a target of 2,557 by March 1996.
Appliance trading moved from a Pounds 300,000 loss to a Pounds 200,000
profit.
COMMENT
When NIE was floated six months ago, the fear was that the association of
the region it serves with terrorism would cast a constant shadow over the
shares. In the event the shares have considerably outperformed the market in
spite of renewed political problems in Northern Ireland and they rose again
yesterday by 15p to 226p on a partly paid basis. The attraction of NIE is
that the external threats are minimal. Competition will take longer to bite
than on the mainland and the regulator's review of the distribution is
further away than that faced by the regional distribution companies for
April 1995. The management has also played its part in vindicating the
shares' outperformance by tackling costs more effectively than expected.
They still have some work to do to improve customer service but this is a
small downside. Assuming a dividend of 11.4 per cent, the shares are on a
prospective yield of 4.1 per cent. That is near the bottom of the recs'
range, leaving little scope for further outperformance. But there are few
dangers for shareholders.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Paramount proposed Thorn EMI take-over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paramount Communications, the US entertainments group, proposed a take-over
of Thorn EMI, the UK-based music and rentals group, in November last year,
but nothing came of the idea.
Thorn said last night that for two to three years prior to the takeover
proposal, it had had discussions with Paramount about collaboration between
Thorn's music arm and the US group's film interests.
The plans were scheduled to be discussed at a two-day meeting in November
last year but Thorn said it brought the talks to a premature close when it
became clear that Paramount wanted to take it over.
Thorn said that it told Paramount that if it wanted to proceed it should
present a formal takeover proposal. Thorn's directors would then be
duty-bound to consider the offer. Nothing further was heard, Thorn said.
Paramount is currently the subject of two opposing takeover bids from Viacom
and QVC Network. News of the contacts emerged in documents filed with the
Supreme Court in the US state of Delaware in connection with the Dollars
10bn takeover battle for Paramount between cable company Viacom and
television shopping group QVC Network.
On Thursday the court will hear an appeal by Paramount against a lower court
ruling blocking an agreed merger between Paramount and Viacom because
Paramount had not given due consideration to a hostile offer from QVC.
The court documents also reveal extensive contacts over potential deals
between many US media companies in the months leading up to the Paramount
battle.
These included discussions between Paramount and Tele-Communications Inc,
the largest US cable service provider, over the possible Paramount purchase
of a large stake in Turner Broadcasting, the owner of the CNN cable news
network.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Westland ahead 22% to Pounds 30.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the UK's only helicopter manufacturer, yesterday reported a better
than expected 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, as strong productivity
improvements offset difficult conditions in defence and civil markets.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 24.9m) on a 6 per cent increase
in sales to Pounds 448m (Pounds 422.1m) for the year to October 1.
New orders showed a sharp decline to Pounds 465m compared with Pounds 1.18m
last time when the company won an order worth Pounds 800m for 44 of its new
Merlin EH101 helicopters from the Royal Navy.
Mr Alan Jones, chief executive, said notwithstanding the lower order intake,
the company had a 'good year'.
'Our new style of management has become deeply engrained inside the
organ-isation and has enabled us to improve productivity and reduce costs,'
said Mr Jones, who is taking over as executive chairman when Sir Leslie
Fletcher, the 71-year-old chairman, retires in February.
Productivity improvements and a sharp drive to reduce stocks helped to cut
net debt from Pounds 30m to Pounds 6m, leaving gearing at 3.1 per cent (16.4
per cent).
However, the company expects to see a temporary rise in borrowings over the
next few years to finance investments in the production launch of the EH101,
which it is developing jointly with Agusta of Italy. Mr Jones said Westland
would be spending some Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m on the EH101 programme, of
which Pounds 8m had already been spent last year.
After the disappointment of the new Canadian government's recent decision to
cancel an order for 43 EH101s, Westland is now banking on a Royal Air Force
order for about 25 EH101s as well as orders for a civil version of the large
helicopter from North Sea oil offshore operators.
Westland has also continued efforts to diversify in the civil aerospace
sector. Mr Jones said the company was well positioned to take advantage of a
recovery in the civil market.
Earnings per share improved to 13.7p (12.1p); the final dividend is 3.25p,
raising the total for the year to 4.5p (4.25p).
COMMENT
The results, at the top end of expectations, reflected a good performance in
a difficult year for the defence and aerospace industry and underlines the
steady progress the company has made to improve productivity and margins
over the past five years. The City expects this will help the company
maintain profit improvement next year, even though there are still few signs
of recovery in the civil aerospace market and the defence business is still
contracting. Profits are forecast to rise to about Pounds 35m-Pounds 36m in
the current year. Against the continuing uncertainties of the defence and
aerospace markets, analysts are focusing on potential rather than on the
short term multiple.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Disposal losses hit Dobson Park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses on the disposal of businesses cut pre-tax profits at Dobson Park
Industries, the mining equipment and industrial electronics group, from
Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 4.2m in the year to October 2.
The group, which merged its mining equipment arm with a rival to survive the
UK coal crisis, said it remained positive about the medium to long-term
future of the business.
Mr Alan Kaye, executive chairman, said that 'In the light of difficult
trading conditions and the collapse in the scale of British Coal's activity,
a satisfactory performance has been achieved overall.'
Operating income fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 8.75m. Under FRS 3, the
pre-tax profits were reduced by a charge of Pounds 4.6m on the sale of two
businesses, Power Tools and Revere Aerospace, which included Pounds 1.5m of
previously written off goodwill.
From January, Dobson Park combined its mining equipment division with Meco
International, a 1989 buy-out from the division of Dowty Group, in a joint
venture called Longwall International. In the period to October 2, it made
sales of Pounds 169m, just under 20 per cent of which went overseas.
Between them, Dobson Park and Meco supplied all of British Coal's hydraulic
roof supports and 80 per cent of its conveyors, used to carry coal away from
the face.
Profits from mining equipment comprised Pounds 1.15m from the group's own
activities prior to the merger and Pounds 3.33m from its 50 per share in
Longwall. The group has since lifted its stake in Longwall to 59 per cent.
Markets in the industrial electronics division continued to be tough, with
operating profits down from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3.9m. However, Mr Kaye said
the sale of Revere Aerospace and Power Tools had removed businesses which
had become peripheral to the group's strategy. Two recent acquisitions,
PressTech Controls - which makes colour register controls for the printing
industry - and TEC vibration monitoring equipment, would further strengthen
the division.
Earnings per share fell from 5.52p to 1.42p under FRS 3, and to 4.65p before
the exceptional disposal costs. The final dividend of 2.55p (3.85p) is cut
in line with the interim to give a total of 3.75p (5.75p), a reduction of 35
per cent.
COMMENT
These are respectable figures, given the speed of the demise of British
Coal. As well as cutting costs at the Longwall joint venture, Dobson Park
has strengthened its underperforming electronics division by disposal and
making potentially useful infill acquisitions. Given the strength of
Longwall's position in overseas markets, the group should benefit from its
reduced cost base next year. The shares, down 4p to 85p, are on a
prospective multiple of 15.8. They are unlikely to advance much until the
electronics division performs better, but they are underpinned at current
levels by a premium prospective yield of 6 per cent.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: CRT edges ahead to Pounds 472,000

   CRT, whose initials now indicate only two of its areas of interest
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
recruitment and training - lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 462,000 to
Pounds 472,000 in the six months to October 31.
Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive, said the group had withdrawn from
consultancy because that side of the business had become a 'tail' that was
wagging the CRT dog.
When CRT bought Doctus Consulting Europe from the receiver for Pounds
175,000 in August 1991, what had started as an advantage - exposure to
European markets - soon became a disadvantage as the economies of France,
Spain and Portugal declined.
However, Mr Chapman was keen to point out the buoyancy of the group's other
two areas of activities. Operating profits in recruitment rose 47 per cent
to Pounds 470,000 (Pounds 320,000) on turnover up 29 per cent to Pounds
9.75m (Pounds 7.58m). In training they increased 23 per cent to Pounds 1.86m
(Pounds 1.51m) on turnover expanded to Pounds 11m (Pounds 9.13m).
Consultancy operations made losses of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 270,000) on
turnover of Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 4.49m) and there were associated closure
and disposal costs of Pounds 471,000 (Pounds 557,000).
Earnings grew to 0.58p (0.48p) per share, insufficient - at this stage  - to
cover the interim dividend lifted to 0.75p (0.65p). Mr Chapman said the rise
was more an indication of the group's strong cashflow, rather than profits.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Resilient S&amp;N shows 2% advance to Pounds
109m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, showed resilience amid
continuing market difficulties to record a 2 per cent increase in first half
pre-tax profits to Pounds 108.9m, against Pounds 107.2m.
'In the UK we experienced some signs of returning consumer confidence but it
remained inconsistent and a lack of certainty was particularly evident in
the high street,' said Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive.
'In our European leisure operations, bookings continued to be remarkably
high but the reluctance of customers to spend freely was evident.
'Christmas sales will not only be important in the immediate financial
contribution they make to annual results but also as an indicator of
consumer attitudes to spending.'
Fully diluted earnings per share for the six months to end-October edged
ahead to 17.7p (17.4p). The interim dividend is increased 4 per cent to
5.99p.
Operating profit was virtually flat at Pounds 122m on turnover of Pounds
773.7m (Pounds 760.7m).
Beer profits declined from Pounds 53.9m to Pounds 50.4m before tax on
marginally lower turnover of Pounds 443.1m. Leading brands, such as
McEwan's, Theakston's and Beck's, backed by a 20 per cent increase in
advertising, held volume decline to 2 per cent in a market which declined 3
per cent.
However, increased competition in the take-home trade resulted in a
significant fall in volumes of low-margin, own-label products and a small
overall loss in market share.
The change to end-product duty brought additional costs of Pounds 2m but the
results benefited from a Pounds 3m reduction in bad debt provisions. Cost
reduction initiatives taken last year made some contribution but will only
become fully effective in the second half.
Retail profits improved from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 29.2m on turnover
maintained at Pounds 145.3m in spite of fewer managed pubs. Food sales grew
more than 5 per cent - and at 8 per cent of turnover offered 'great scope
for future development,' said Mr Stewart.
Integration of the Chef &amp; Brewer estate, acquired in October, will be
completed by the end of the financial year together with the first phase of
an investment programme of Pounds 11m in 150 of the pubs.
Leisure operations lifted profits 9 per cent to Pounds 42.4m (Pounds 38.8m)
on turnover up from Pounds 169.7m to Pounds 185.3m. Center Parcs' profits in
the UK were ahead 15 per cent and bookings for 1994 were significantly
higher. Occupancy rates of 89 per cent were achieved in France where
capacity was doubled. Pontin's recorded a 5 per cent increase in turnover
and an 8 per cent rise in bookings.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Friends Provident pays Pounds 115m for NM
Financial Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friends Provident, one of the UK's largest mutual life assurance and
investment management organisations, has moved to widen its distribution
capacity by buying the NM Financial Management Group for Pounds 115m.
NM was sold by the National Mutual Life Association of Australia, which
intends to focus its development in Asian and Australasian markets where it
is a more significant force than it has been in the UK.
The purchase of NM's life, pensions and unit trusts businesses will add over
Pounds 2bn to Friends Provident's Pounds 10bn of assets under management. It
will also involve the transfer of 350,000 policies and 250,000 clients to
Friends Provident's customer base of about 2m policies and 1.5m clients.
Mr Michael Doerr, the managing director of Friends Provident who will become
chairman of NM, said yesterday that while he expected some short-term
benefits as the two organisations came together, the main purpose of the
move was to broaden the customer base in order to cut unit costs.
Some 200 to 250 of NM's 300-plus self-employed sales agents are expected to
join the 400 existing employed Friends Provident sales force.
Mr Roman Cizdyn, life assurance analyst with Smith New Court, said that the
move made sense for both parties: smaller offices such as NM were facing
increasing expenses to meet compliance costs, while Friends Provident had to
take account of the breaking of its link with the Abbey National in
February.
Friends Provident is also buying NM's life and pensions company in the
Republic of Ireland.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Avesco incurs Pounds 2.3m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avesco, the broadcast equipment and services group, which has been investing
heavily in its VideoLogic multimedia technology division, yesterday reported
a Pounds 2.32m first half pre-tax loss and announced a share placement to
raise about Pounds 5m.
The deficit for the six months to September 30 compared with a previous
profit of Pounds 23,000. Turnover slipped to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 11.2m).
There were losses of 2.97p against earnings of 0.025p. There is no interim
dividend.
The directors stated that the lower sales reflected difficult trading
conditions in Europe at a time when the group has yet to benefit from any
sales of mass market products developed under the IBM/VideoLogic joint
development agreement established last year.
During the period the VideoLogic division incurred a Pounds 2.34m (Pounds
541,000) trading loss on turnover of Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 4.57m). Mr Richard
Murray, chairman, said, nevertheless, that VideoLogic had met 'a number of
important milestones in its product development programme, its expansion
into Germany and France and in the recruitment of senior executives.'
The group's AVS Broadcast television products division reported an increased
trading loss of Pounds 572,000 (Pounds 310,000) on flat turnover of Pounds
1.78m (Pounds 1.73m), while all the businesses in the services division
traded profitably but reported a reduced trading profit of Pounds 759,000
(Pounds 1.18m) on turnover of Pounds 4.58m (Pounds 4.72m.)
In order to meet VideoLogic's short-term need for additional working
capital, SG Warburg is underwriting a placement of 4.06m shares with
investors at a price to be determined by demand. Meanwhile, the group is
continuing to work on a timetable for spinning off VideoLogic.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Scotts row deepens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The row at Bristol Scotts deepened yesterday as Mr Ian Stevens, who has
called for the resignation of two directors and the chairman, yesterday
demanded clarification of several issues. These included an acquisition
which he stated had not been declared in the accounts, and the transfer of
364,213 non-voting shares into voting shares.
He reiterated his call for an extraordinary meeting at which he aims to
appoint himself and fellow shareholder Sir Ian Rankin to the board.
Meanwhile, the dispute over control of shares, originally owned by director
Mr Nicholas Kerman and subsequently sold to publisher Mr Nicholas Berry will
continue at a high court hearing on Friday.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: API improves 41% despite depressed market
segments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at API, the packaging group, advanced 41 per cent from
Pounds 3.85m to Pounds 5.41m in the year to October 2. The shares rose 8p to
358p.
Turnover grew 18 per cent to Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 61.9m), said Mr Michael
Smith, group chief executive, in a period when API's main 'geographical
market segments were depressed and competition had become stiffer'.
He added that the group was 'in a strong, healthy position', and in the
future had 'a lot to go for' - the expansion of API's relatively small
market shares, growth driven by new products, organic growth and further
differentiation between existing products.
Six months ago Mr Smith talked of the addition of a third leg within the
packaging and office products area; that is 'still on the cards', and could
either be a large acquisition for cash and shares - the group has net cash
of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 800,000) - or two or three smaller ones. Talks were
continuing, he said.
Mr Smith said that API had forged 'longer term alliances with key accounts',
some up to three years and not fixed just on price. Both sides could reduce
costs, with the customer being able to eliminate its quality control points.
Group pre-tax margins were up from 6.2 to 7.4 per cent. In foils and
laminates they rose from 6.8 to 8.1 per cent as operating profits grew to
Pounds 3.62m (Pounds 2.52m) on turnover of Pounds 44.8m (Pounds 37m).
In converted film and paper products, margins moved into double digits at
10.1 per cent, against 9.8 per cent. Operating profits rose to Pounds 2.5m
(Pounds 2.03m) on turnover of Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 20.8m).
Profits at the somewhat anomalous heating and ventilation side slipped to
Pounds 208,000 (Pounds 230,000) on sales down at Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 4.2m).
Earnings emerged at 16.85p (12.8p) per share after a tax charge up at 33.5
(29) per cent because of an improvement in US earnings. The final dividend
is lifted to 4.9p (4.45p) for a total of 8.25p (7.5p).

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Strong sales in eastern Europe help lift
Oriflame to Pounds 5.39m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance in eastern Europe helped Oriflame, the cosmetics and
toiletries direct sales company, to increase interim pre-tax profits by 29
per cent to Pounds 5.39m.
The contribution from associated companies - including Oriflame's 25 per
cent stake in Oresa, the eastern European cosmetics door to door retailer
set up three years ago - more than doubled from Pounds 410,000 to Pounds
990,000.
This helped the group offset the effects of weaker currencies in Sweden and
Finland, which were estimated to have depressed profits for the six months
to September 30 by about Pounds 500,000. Pre-tax profits were also helped by
a sharp drop in interest payments from Pounds 803,000 to Pounds 432,000.
Sales were 11 per cent higher at Pounds 40.9m.
Mr Robert af Jochnick, the Swedish chairman, said the bulk of the profits
increase came from the eastern European business.
'This year has been spectacular,' he said. In the last year Oresa's sales
had increased from Pounds 20m to between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m.
Oriflame supplied products to Oresa, as well as receiving licensing and
royalty fees from its eastern European counterpart. About 40 per cent of the
profits generated by Oresa found their way back to Oriflame.
The core direct sales division showed a 24 per cent increase in sales, with
the strongest increase from emerging markets such as Portugal, Mexico and
Chile.
The UK, US and France remained difficult. Oriflame intended to relaunch in
all three markets, and restructuring charges of about Pounds 350,000 were
taken for changes in France and the US.
Earnings rose by 24 per cent to 8.4p.
The interim dividend is increased by 0.3p to 4.3p.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wind of change blows up on the Clyde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James McColl, executive chairman of Clyde Blowers, has ambitions. 'We aim
to be a hyper-growth company in the next five years, and build a big
engineering group based in Scotland."
Despite having had a quote since the late 1950s, Clydebank-based Clyde
Blowers is not a familiar name in financial circles. But its shares have
risen 76 per cent this year to peak recently at 605p. In the year to August
31 its turnover jumped from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 7.4m and it returned to
profit.
Clyde Blowers is a long-established producer of equipment for cleaning soot
caused by coal and oil from boilers. It is one of the main concerns in a
niche market and has customers worldwide.
However, it was stagnating until early last year when Mr Ted Wilson, the
87-year-old chairman, retired and the Wilson family sold 29.9 per cent of
the company for Pounds 900,000 to Mr McColl, an engineer with company doctor
experience.
'It was like walking into a museum,' says Mr McColl, who is 40. 'The company
was reactive and did not seek customers or orders for spares.' Profits had
been invested in a Pounds 2m shares portfolio. 'But I bought 50 years of
experience.'
He swiftly shed 50 of the 120-strong workforce, improved manufacturing
efficiency, found new orders and increased sales of spares. New equipment
sales were up 30 per cent this year.
In April Clyde Blowers bought Brighton-based Sturtevant Engineering, a maker
of pressurised pneumatic conveying equipment which removes such things as
ash. Clyde Blowers spent only Pounds 336,000 but gained a company with
Pounds 5m of turnover and a strong order book. In August it took over Boiler
Products Engineering, a Belgium-based subsidiary of GEC-Alsthom, also in
boiler cleaning. The Pounds 3m deal was financed with a Pounds 3.6m rights
issue. It gave Clyde Blowers more access to the francophone boiler market
and made the group the biggest independent boiler cleaning equipment maker
in Europe.
The recent results suggest that Clyde Blowers has returned to financial
health. Although it still made an operating loss of Pounds 268,000, Mr
McColl says the loss was down to Pounds 64,000 in the second half, and
included the cost of setting up a Pounds 200,000 head office operation. The
operating losses were wiped out by a Pounds 473,000 profit on the sale of
the remains of the investment portfolio, producing pre-tax profits Pounds
205,000 (against a loss of Pounds 141,000).
Mr McColl says its current turnover was equivalent to Pounds 15m on an
annualised basis, and that orders are strong. Now the new head office staff
is looking at acquisition targets in the UK, the Continent and the US to
complement organic growth in boiler cleaning and pressurised pneumatic
equipment.
'There are fantastic opportunities and we are in a wonderful position with
cash and no borrowings,' says Mr McColl.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: NHL losses cut to Pounds 37m after lower
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Home Loans Holdings, the mortgage lender, announced a sharp fall in
pre-tax losses from Pounds 159.4m to Pounds 36.6m in the year to September
30, after a marked drop in provisions against bad and doubtful debts.
Provisions were halved at Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 163.9m) because of
stabilising house prices, falling arrears, and improvements in the amount of
cash received as a percentage of monthly payments due.
Mr Jonathan Perry, chairman, said that the number of accounts more than
three months in arrears had fallen to 1,762 from the group's total of 45,000
accounts, compared with 6,130 at the end of September 1992.
He added that the company was now trading profitably.
The company said the improvement was shown by the cash received from
borrowers in arrears increasing from 81 per cent of normal monthly payments
in September 1992 to 98 per cent in September this year.
Total operating income for the period was Pounds 83.4m (Pounds 51.8m).
Losses per share were 43.1p (156.4p).
Mr Perry said that the next stage of the group's strategy was to rebuild its
capital base. The group managed Pounds 2bn of mortgage assets at the end of
September, down by 23 per cent over the past year.
NHL's mortgage lending business was badly hit in the fall-out from the late
1980s housing boom. Rapid growth at that time meant that its portfolio was
not strong enough to survive the subsequent collapse.
It intends to start lending new mortgages from mid-1994, offering products
to new borrowers. Existing borrowers, who have been paying rates above the
market average, yesterday benefited from the passing on of the 0.5 per cent
pre-Budget cut in interest rates.
Mr Perry said that there were preference dividend arrears of Pounds 16m, and
negative distributable reserves of Pounds 153m.
During the year the group brought on to its balance sheet the special
purpose vehicle companies which make up most of its mortgage
securitisations. It said that the effect on the 1993 trading performance was
neutral.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Mellon Bank buys fund manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mellon Bank yesterday announced the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.2bn) takeover of
Dreyfus, one of the US's largest mutual fund groups, marking the first large
move by a bank into the booming funds business.
Mr Frank Cahouet, chairman and chief executive of the Pittsburgh-based bank,
predicted that the deal would provide a model for future convergence between
the banking and mutual fund industries in the US. At present, banks account
for only 8 per cent of mutual funds, though this figure will rise to 12 per
cent if yesterday's deal is completed.
The transaction is likely to intensify official concerns about the expansion
of banks into investment management. Congress has expressed unease with
growing bank sales of mutual funds, fearing that bank customers may not
understand the investments they are buying or realise that the federal
guarantee that applies to bank deposits does not extend to mutual funds.
In an apparent attempt to play down such concerns, Mr Cahouet said the deal
would add to the 'strength and diversity of the financial system'.
Dreyfus was the sixth largest mutual funds group with Dollars 76.7bn under
management at the end of October, down from Dollars 80bn a year before,
according to the Investment Companies Institute.
The company's historically strong position in short-term money market funds,
at a time when investors have been shifting into longer-term equity and bond
funds, account for its lack of growth.
The all-share deal would dilute Mellon's earnings next year by around 9 per
cent, accounting for a Dollars 4 3/8 fall in its share price yesterday
morning, to Dollars 53. Both Mellon and Dreyfus predicted that revenues
would grow faster after the deal. Mellon, with 1.1m customers, will sell
Dreyfus investments, while Dreyfus expects to sell Mellon products such as
credit cards and mortgages to its 900,000 customers.
Earlier talks stalled over Dreyfus' concerns about the cultural effects of
being taken over by a bank. These concerns seem to have been overcome as
Dreyfus will continue to operate as an independent company within the Mellon
group.
Mellon embarked on acquisitions to increase its fee income after heavy

FT  07 DEC 93 / Granada steps up pace in ITV game of musical chairs: A
determined LWT does not cast itself as helpless target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tempo increased yesterday in the game of musical chairs for the future
ownership of ITV as Granada made its expected play for London Weekend
Television.
Carlton Communication's agreed bid for Central last week removed one large
chair. When Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, tried to sit down
on the chair of his choice yesterday, Sir Christopher Bland, the LWT
chairman made it clear he had no intention of vacating it.
For Granada, the leisure, television rental and computer services company
responsible for programmes such as Coronation Street, Prime Suspect and
World In Action, the attractions are obvious.
It was clear when Granada spent about Pounds 84m in June and July to buy a
17.5 per cent stake in LWT, that the London company was the target as soon
as the government relaxed ownership rules, now in prospect subject to
parliamentary approval.
The prospective deal would create the second 'super' ITV company,
broadcasting to 16m people and accounting for about 22 per cent of total ITV
advertising revenue, second only to Carlton/Central in the pecking order.
The offer of 6 new Granada shares for every 5 LWT shares was worth 582p an
LWT share at yesterday's close and values the company at Pounds 600m. There
is a full cash alternative of 528p. The bid was carefully pitched at a small
discount to the LWT price of 585p before the deal was announced.
Mr Gerry Robinson argues that the offer already represents a generous
takover premium: 54.8 per cent on the share bid before Granada made its
summer bid for an LWT stake; and 15.4 per cent to the share price before the
government announced its intention to change the rules.
Granada brought forward its results announcement to show a larger than
expected pre-tax 53 per cent increase to Pounds 176m. Turnover rose 221 per
cent to Pounds 1.6bn, earnings per share at 24.8p was up by 56 per cent. The
dividend per share rose to 8.75p, up 14 per cent.
All the Granada divisions showed increases in operating profit. The
operating profits of Granada Television rose 30 per cent from Pounds 33m to
Pounds 43m.
To complete the attack, Granada said LWT was too small on its own to take
advantage of the new opportunities in international television markets.
That is not how Sir Christopher Bland sees it. Sir Christopher and his chief
executive Mr Greg Dyke spent less than half an hour at a private meeting on
Saturday morning with Mr Alex Bernstein, the Granada chairman, and Mr
Robinson, to politely but firmly say 'no'. Granada, said the LWT management
which collectively owns about 10 per cent of the company worth Pounds 60m,
was a conglomerate with only 20 per cent of its operating profit coming from
television and therefore had little to offer LWT shareholders.
It is likely now that Sir Christopher will sit tight and play the game long.
A robust LWT defence document will reply to the Granada offer document and
that may take until Christmas.
The LWT view is that a fundamental revaluing of the ITV system is under way
in the wake of liberalising of the ownership rules and that Granada does not
adequately reflect that.
LWT is also a potential predator as well as prey and is looking seriously at
bidding in its own right for a second ITV licence. There are three potential
targets.
A bid for Scottish Television would be possible but could become a sensitive
political issue. The two most likely prospects are Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, a
company in which LWT has a 14 per cent stake and Anglia Television. At
Yorkshire, the problems include the need to dispose of the separate Tyne
Tees licence because LWT could not hold three licences, and the pre-tax
losses of about Pounds 8.5m that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees will announce later
this month.
Anglia, now capitalised at about Pounds 200m would be an expensive bite,
twice as big as Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbrokers Goldman Sachs, believes the
Granada bid is 'finely balanced', although it may have to be followed up
with a better cash alternative and that LWT could yet come up with 'some
angle'.
The music may be about to increase in tempo yet again. From January 1,
before any Granada deal could be completed, the rules make it easier for
European Union companies to take over ITV licences. There have been no
reliable sightings so far of continental European players wishing to join.
But if there were, the most obvious and attractive target would be LWT,
which produces London Burning, Blind Date and The South Bank Show for the
ITV network.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Saatchi &amp; Saatchi shares fall after profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the heavily-indebted advertising group, fell by
23p to 157p yesterday following a profits warning.
The loss of two large accounts in the US, worth Pounds 30m in revenue for
1994, plus pessimism about client spending, will lead to more redundancies.
An extra Pounds 10m of severance costs in 1993 comes on top of the
previously-expected Pounds 5m, said the group.
Saatchi is to vacate its offices in Berkeley Square, in the West End of
London, which will save Pounds 1.2m annually from 1994.
Last week the group announced that Mr Charles Saatchi, who has played little
part in the day-to-day running of the business, would step down as a
director. He will draw a salary of Pounds 312,500 but has given up his
entitlement to twice that.
Analysts had been forecasting pre-tax profits for 1993 of between Pounds 24m
and Pounds 29m. Mr Neil Blackley, of Goldman Sachs, who had been forecasting
Pounds 25m, said Pounds 19m was now more likely. The 1993 results are due in
March. His forecast for 1994 is likely to be revised downwards from Pounds
42m to Pounds 35m.
Mr Blackley said yesterday: 'Everyone loses business. The problem is they
haven't been winning any. It's like a football game. You're always going to
let a few goals in but you've got to keep scoring more than you let in.
That's what Saatchi has not been achieving.'
The 1992 results, excluding the Pounds 600m of goodwill written off by the
group, showed underlying pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.9m. No dividend was
paid, but Mr Charles Scott, who took over as chief executive in April, has
committed the group to paying a dividend in 1994.
The two large accounts lost in the US were from Chrysler, the carmaker, and
Helene Curtis, the haircare products company. The group has also taken
soundings among its 13,000 clients and is pessimistic about spending on
advertising for 1994, particularly in continental Europe and in the US.
Saatchi is pitching for several large accounts, including Burger King, the
hamburger chain.
The warning was announced in New York at the Paine Webber media conference,
attended by leading industry figures.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Salomon drops Lloyd's plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, yesterday announced the withdrawal
of its plans to launch a new Lloyd's investment company, underlining the
limit of institutional interest in the insurance market.
Salomon and Johnson &amp; Higgins, the US insurance brokers, sought Dollars 300m
(Pounds 200m) for London Market Investors from US and other investors to
back between 40 and 50 syndicates.
Yet despite the success of more than a dozen Lloyd's investment trusts -
which have raised more than Pounds 830m for Lloyd's - Salomon was unable to
persuade US investors.
'We had a lot of investors sitting on the fence looking at the deal but we
could not get them to move quickly enough,' said Mr Marty Dolan,
vice-president of Salomon's corporate finance in London.
'The further away from Lloyd's you go the more scepticism there is,' added
Mr Dolan, who said many US investors were a 'little sceptical'. By contrast
Salomon had experienced less difficulty in persuading British institutions,
which would have supplied a quarter of the capital.
The withdrawal of the Salomon scheme and the comparative success of UK-based
schemes marks a sharp reversal from the pattern of Lloyd's corporate capital
efforts earlier this year, when US banks made most of the early running in
Lloyd's efforts to raise corporate capital.
While 11 UK investment trusts and companies are trading on the London Stock
Exchange, the other mainly US-based vehicle, Lutine Capital Corporation, has
yet to finalise its plans. And two other US companies - Marsh &amp; McLennan,
the world's largest broker, and JP Morgan, the investment bank, both
prominent supporters of Lloyd's early efforts - have failed to deliver
investment schemes.
Marsh and Morgan backed unsuccessful Mr Stephen Merrett, the former deputy
chairman of Lloyd's, to link his Merrett Group with corporate capital.
Following the failure of plans to form a consortium arrangement with
Travelers Insurance, Merrett Group withdrew from underwriting activities
last month, and yesterday completed the sale of another of its underwriting
syndicates - number 179 - to the rival Catlin Underwriting Agencies.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Airtours increases 25% to Pounds 45.5m: Holiday group to
broaden price ranges as bookings for summer 1994 rise 53%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours, the holiday group, yesterday announced full-year pre-tax profits
up 24.6 per cent to Pounds 45.5m and said it had clearly established itself
as the UK's second largest tour operator after Thomson.
Airtours said its market share last summer was 21 per cent, against 13.9 per
cent the previous year. It said this year's figure was more than double the
market share achieved by Owners Abroad, the rival tour operator which it
failed to take over earlier this year.
Mr David Crossland, chairman, said the group would in future sell Airtours
packages as middle-market rather than budget holidays. Aspro, the tour
operator which Airtours bought last June, will become the group's budget
holiday brand. Mr Crossland said Airtours aimed to develop or buy an
additional upmarket holiday brand.
Mr Crossland admitted that there was a morale problem at Hogg Robinson, the
travel agency chain Airtours bought earlier in the year, but said this
affected only 12 of its 210 branches.
He said his attention had been focused on integrating the head offices of
Hogg Robinson and Pickfords Travel, which Airtours bought last year. The
group would now concentrate on introducing profit sharing and branch
budgetary control to the Hogg Robinson outlets. The two chains have 545
branches altogether, making Airtours the second largest UK travel retailer.
Mr Crossland wanted the number of retail outlets to increase to between 700
and 750 over the next two years.
The pre-tax profits figure for the year to September 30, 1993, included a
Pounds 9m charge for the failed Owners Abroad bid. Operating profit before
bid costs rose 49.2 per cent to Pounds 54.5m. Turnover rose 51.8 per cent to
Pounds 615.6m. A final dividend of 8p brings the total pay-out to 9p - 24.1
per cent up on last year's 7.25p. Earnings per share were 29.22p, up from
27.47p.
Airtours said its bookings for this winter were 38 per cent up on last year.
The group's winter market share is 19 per cent, compared with 17 per cent
last year. Early bookings for summer 1994 are 53 per cent ahead. Airtours'
summer market share is up three percentage points at 24 per cent.
The large increase in bookings for next summer has been partly caused by
early discounts offered by travel agents' chains. Airtours estimated market
growth next summer at between 5 and 10 per cent.

FT  07 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the gilt market's positive reception to last week's Budget, tomorrow's
auction should go like a dream. In practice, cover could disappoint. Not
only has the market's strength made it hard for market-makers to build up
short positions to absorb the Pounds 3bn issue, but the strength of demand
for 10-year paper is also questionable.
Domestic investors may be reluctant to switch out of longer-dated paper for
a partly-paid issue which will leave them with unspent cash at the year end.
Foreign investors have focused on short-dated issues in the hope of interest
rate cuts. The unusually low spreads over continental markets may also limit
demand.
The market, though, brushed aside low cover ratios in both the June and
September auctions. It may well be prepared to do so again. Reduced issuance
prospects for next year, the chance of more rate cuts and low inflation all
provide fundamental support.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Failure to capture Owners Abroad has not held Airtours back. Its shares have
risen by 40 per cent since it gave up the chase in March, while Owners has
fallen by a similar proportion. A 25 per cent rise in full year profits,
even after charging Pounds 9m bid costs, justifies the rise. Strong early
bookings for next summer hold the promise of another good year to come, if
the industry can avoid a sustained bout of discounting in the New Year.
Owners' underperformance is a reminder of how quickly things can go awry for
a tour operator if management gets distracted. Airtours faces the challenge
of uniting 545 Pickfords and Hogg Robinson travel agencies under a single
banner. Further acquisitions, including an up-market tour operator to
complement the Airtours brand, cannot be ruled out. Plans to expand in
hotels and aircraft contain special pitfalls, since high fixed costs are a
strong incentive to sacrifice margins in favour of market share.
Airtours maintains that its ambitions in these areas are strictly limited.
Long may it remain so. With Thomson and Airtours now accounting for more
than half the package holiday market, there must be a decent chance of
maintaining discipline on margins. Holiday prices have held up well through
the recession. The real challenge, though, is avoiding overcapacity as
consumer spending rises. Memories of the 1987 price war will keep Airtours
on a price-earnings discount to the stock market average, despite its
impressive record.

Scottish &amp; Newcastle would have had to produce scintillating interim figures
to maintain the recent strong momentum of its shares. In the event, profits
were merely in line with expectations and the company's reluctance to give
detailed breakdowns of its businesses again did little to help its case. So
yesterday's 2.6 per cent fall in the shares should not be seen as a
reconsideration of its Chef &amp; Brewer purchase. It will be another six months
at least before hard evidence emerges of the degree to which Scottish has
been able to exploit that particular opportunity.
The latest omens are mixed. Volume sales of some brands, notably
Theakston's, held up well. Own label production fell sharply, albeit from a
tiny base. That changes the mix of output, though, and the smaller component
of low-margin business suggests the underlying margin pressure on branded
products was greater than meets the eye. Scottish admits to tough conditions
in the important off-trade. In leisure, there is a hint that the continental
recession is affecting Center Parcs. Occupancy is good but customers show a
reluctance to spend on site.
Indeed retailing is the one activity where margins are improving. In theory
that bodes well for Chef &amp; Brewer, which increases the emphasis on the
lucrative food sector. Much depends on whether the Pounds 11m refurbishment
promised in the second half turns out to be sufficient, and whether capital
expenditure elsewhere - such as the development of new Center Parcs - has to
be restrained to make way for more spending on the retail estate. Scottish
has come late to food retailing. Others such as Whitbread have a track
record. On a historic multiple of over 16 compared with Whitbread's 13.5,
Scottish has a lot to prove.

FT  07 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Granada's Weekend affair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, lacks in subtlety as a
fighter he makes up with effective punching. Ever since it bought its stake
in London Weekend Television, Granada has done little to hide its ambition
to knock out LWT. The stake now looks like a cheap platform to fight the
battle, while poor LWT finds most of its defences blocked. Its most direct
way out - a bid for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - would be difficult to organise.
Shareholders might well look askance if such a move appeared to be a hurried
poison pill defence. None of the other ITV companies is likely to top
Granada's offer, and the possibility of a continental white knight may well
prove a canard.
LWT's chances of remaining independent rely on more subtle factors. Because
Granada's cash alternative is 10 per cent below the share offer, the battle
is essentially about paper and prospects. Granada's bid does look generous
judged against this year's earnings, but shareholders also have to weigh the
price at which they are prepared to sell scarce ITV licences. Network
advertising revenues are likely to be depressed this year, so the bid is not
as generous as it first appears. The lack of contiguous licence areas and
combination of a weekend metropolitan operator with a seven-day northern
franchise might trouble some. Yet LWT can hardly plead this in its own
defence since it has formed a marketing alliance with Yorkshire.
Both managements have done well in recent years, and Mr Robinson's argument
that joint costs could be cut so that the deal would not dilute Granada's
earnings deserves the benefit of the doubt. Under the rather arbitrary
rules, the pull towards three large groups - Carlton/Central, Granada/LWT
and Meridian/Anglia - is very strong. LWT will find that hard to shrug off.
It may yet face a choice between going down fighting, or accepting a
sweetened offer to take a dive.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Pollution insurance at risk over Lords ruling: Cover
withdrawal may lay companies open to claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers may withdraw all cover for pollution in commercial policies,
leaving much of British industry unprotected against future clean-up costs.
The decision, which could cost industry millions of pounds, could be
hastened by a ruling in the House of Lords later this week in a landmark
case involving the Eastern Counties Leather tannery, its insurers, and
Cambridge Water.
A ruling against Eastern Counties will increase legal uncertainty about
liability for past clean-up costs, prompting insurers to move quickly to
remove cover for future 'sudden and accidental' pollution - caused by spills
of chemicals or the release of toxic fumes, for example.
The Association of British Insurers introduced new wordings for public
liability policies excluding coverage for 'gradual' pollution in 1991. 'We
are looking to see whether any pollution cover can realistically be
provided,' conceded Mr Tony Baker, the head of public affairs at the ABI.
The Lords ruling, expected on Thursday, is viewed as particularly
significant by insurers because a Court of Appeal verdict last year 'moved
the goalposts' in environmental liability cases, according to Mr Paul Taylor
of Berrymans, the solicitors representing ECL and its insurers, General
Accident.
Cambridge Water Company originally sued ECL after it was forced to abandon a
borehole at Sawston, Cambridgeshire, following the discovery of
concentrations in ground water of perchloroethene, a dry-cleaning fluid used
by the tannery to degrease animal pelts.
Awarding more than Pounds 1m in damages and costs to Cambridge Water, the
appeal court judges found that ECL was not negligent, but liable in
'nuisance' - an older legal concept under which it is not necessary to prove
any fault to show liability.
'What we have seen in the analysis of the case is that English common law
has produced a very strange animal - retrospective strict liability,'
commented Mr Taylor.
Insurers fear that they could become liable to pay as much as Pounds 3bn of
an estimated Pounds 30bn needed to clean up land already contaminated.
The implications of the case are 'sufficiently worrying for insurers to make
sure they don't get caught out in the future', explained Mr Baker.
It was likely that 'sudden and accidental' pollution cover would be excluded
from all public liability policies 'within three years regardless of what
happens', but that a decision in favour of Cambridge Water would 'hasten'
any developments.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Japanese stocks fall 3.5% after stimulus plan is shelved
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock market fell 3.5 per cent yesterday - its second-biggest
slide this year - after the Japanese government shelved plans for economic
support measures it had hoped to announce this week.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, tried to reassure investors
by saying the government would simultaneously work out the stimulus package
and the budget for the 1994 fiscal year. That would follow the passage,
still under way, of a supplementary budget to finance previous economic
measures launched in September.
The country's seven-party ruling coalition is struggling to enact political
reform by a year-end deadline as well as pull the economy away from
recession. However, it is becoming increasingly stricken by internal
disagreements, has been tripped up in parliament, and bureaucrats from the
powerful finance ministry are at odds with leaders of the Social Democratic
party, the largest of the partners, over proposed changes to the tax system.
A number of cabinet members have pledged a further general economic stimulus
including an income tax cut and an easing of land transaction taxes.
However, the coalition is divided on the extent to which these should be
offset by a rise in indirect taxes, as the finance ministry wishes.
The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares, additionally depressed by poor
bank earnings and the arrest of a property company executive, fell 618.97
points to close at 16,840.38, some 20.4 per cent below its September peak
for the year. The decline was its first in five trading days, after shares
rallied last week on hopes of an economic stimulus.
In early trading today, stocks gained strength with the Nikkei up more than
200 points.
The Tokyo market has been fluctuating wildly on fears over a financial
system burdened by bad debts and government attempts to reassure investors
with promises of additional measures to secure a so far elusive economic
recovery. Some analysts fear the Nikkei might fall to 12,000 because of the
lack of a clear commitment to help ailing banks.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Car sales up 19% as recovery grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New car sales in the UK jumped last month by 19.4 per cent year on year as
the recovery accelerated. For the first time diesel cars accounted for more
than a quarter of all new car registrations.
The UK is virtually the only car market in western Europe where new car
demand has grown this year.
Registrations in the first 11 months have risen by 12.6 per cent, according
to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders. This compares with a fall of more than 15 per cent in western
Europe in the first 10 months.
The recovery in UK new vehicle demand is becoming more broadly based as the
commercial vehicle sector also emerges from recession.
Registrations of new commercial vehicles in November rose by 6.3 per cent
year-on-year. Commercial vehicle sales remained depressed in the first half
of the year but have now been higher than a year ago in each of the past
three months.
The first signs of recovery came from the heavy truck sector of the market
late last year, as hauliers began to replace ageing fleets. However, in the
past two months higher demand has also been seen in the small business
sector, with rising sales of vans.
New car sales in November rose to 127,674 from 106,902 a year ago, while
registrations in the first 11 months increased to 1,704,696 from 1,513,698
in the corresponding period last year.
Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association,
claimed yesterday that 'much of the increase in new car sales could be
attributed to intensive marketing efforts' by carmakers, which were
squeezing profit margins. The SMMT admitted that the big jump in car sales
last month was 'quite startling'.
The strength of demand for diesel cars has taken the industry by surprise.
Sales of diesel cars in November accounted for 25.7 per cent of new sales
compared with 15.9 per cent a year ago. In the first 11 months of this year
diesel sales rose 71.6 per cent to 325,004 from 189,934 a year ago.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Breaking the power duopoly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's two large electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen,
have been under almost perpetual investigation since their privatisation in
1990. Now the time is approaching for Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
industry's regulator, to decide whether to refer the companies to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He has promised to announce his decision
this month.
The suspicion is that the two generators are using their market power to
keep prices artificially high. Prices in the pool, the wholesale spot market
for electricity, have increased sharply in the past three years.
Is the allegation of overcharging valid? According to the generators, their
prices are actually too low. The pool price is still not high enough to
provide a reasonable return on assets after paying for running costs and
overheads. They also argue that their market share has fallen since
privatisation as new players have entered the industry. Not only has
state-owned Nuclear Electric increased production, but groups with links to
the regional electricity companies have built gas-fired power stations.
Competition, both actual and potential, puts a cap on the prices they can
charge.
The generators' defence relies on the assumption that the right benchmark
for prices is the 'long-run' cost of producing electricity. This is the
price necessary before it would be profitable to build additional generating
capacity. Such a price would clearly need to provide for a return on
investment and cover overheads, as well as paying for running costs.
Massive overcapacity
Long-run costs would be a reasonable benchmark but for the fact that there
is already massive overcapacity in the industry, as a result of which there
will be no need for extra power stations to be built for several years. In a
competitive industry with excess capacity, prices would be at or near
short-run marginal cost as rivals sought to keep their plants utilised. Only
as supply and demand came into balance would prices rise to the long-run
level.
It was the government's intention that a competitive market should develop
when it privatised the generators. Observers hoped that the pool, which
involves bidding by generators at half-hourly intervals, would encourage
National Power and PowerGen to compete vigorously on price.
But, in practice, the two companies have been able to increase their bid
prices. This is mainly because they own all the coal-fired stations in
England and Wales. These have higher running costs than the nuclear and
gas-fired stations owned by competitors and so, under the complex pool
system, are the last to be brought on stream as demand mounts. The two
generators therefore, in effect, determine the pool price and have no
incentive to set it at the short-run marginal cost.
Retrograde step
Professor Littlechild must scrutinise the detailed financial data to which
he has privileged access before deciding whether this amounts to
unacceptable overcharging. If he concludes that prices are too high, he has
three alternatives: price controls; voluntary disposal of power stations;
and an MMC referral.
The price control option is the least attractive. Given that the market
could eventually become competitive, heavy-handed regulation would be a
retrograde step.
A better approach would be to tackle National Power's and PowerGen's market
power head-on. This would probably mean breaking the companies up, so that a
larger number of competing groups owned the coal-fired stations which set
pool prices. Ideally, such a break-up would be achieved voluntarily. But
given that a break-up rather than simply the sale of a handful of stations
would be needed, it is unlikely the generators would agree.
That would leave an MMC referral as the likeliest way forward. Such a move
would have its own drawbacks. It would be time-consuming and, arguably,
premature given that privatisation is only three years old. The sale of the
government's remaining 40 per cent stake in the generators would also have
to be delayed. But if Prof Littlechild's investigation confirms that prices
are too high and he is unable to secure a voluntary break-up, he should not
shrink from making a referral.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Wobble atop the pillars of state: Quentin Peel and Judy
Dempsey on the mounting political pressures facing Germany's Helmut Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man who brought Germany unification, it is a
symbolic slap in the face to see his Christian Democratic Union pipped at
the polls by the Party of Democratic Socialism, the former east German
communist party.
Yet that is precisely what happened on Sunday night, when the CDU in the
eastern state of Brandenburg saw itself reduced to just over 20 per cent of
the vote in local elections, against more than 21 per cent for the
communists.
It was not a vote against unification itself. 'Absolutely not,' says Mr
Lothar Nicht, the Moscow-trained ex-diplomat who is party manager for the
PDS in the state. 'We are not opposed to unification. Of course, many of our
members wanted it, but in another kind of Germany.'
It was a protest vote rather, against Bonn, against high unemployment,
against the insecurity of the post-communist world, and against the
excessive influence of Wessis - west Germans - in the east. It was a protest
vote against all the established parties: the opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD), which is in power in Brandenburg, itself slipped a few points,
and looks set to lose the mayor's race in Potsdam, the state capital, to the
PDS.
It was also, at least in part, a protest against the failure of Mr Kohl to
deliver the 'blooming' eastern Germany economy which he promised just three
years ago. The official unemployment rate in Brandenburg exceeds 17 per
cent, whilst thousands of steel workers and miners are threatened by
redundancy.
For Mr Kohl, it was the culmination of a terrible 10 days in the life of his
coalition with the Free Democratic Party in Bonn.
First, he saw his personal candidate for the job of federal president, Mr
Steffen Heitmann, withdraw in humiliation from the contest. He pulled out
when it became clear that his conservative views and lack of public
relations skills meant he would not gain a majority in the federal electoral
college which willchoose a president next May.
Then one week before the Brandenburg poll, the entire CDU-FDP coalition
government in the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt resigned over
allegations that ministers imported from the west had unjustly inflated
their salaries. Finally, in a flurry of headlines and magazine cover
stories, the German media have turned on the embattled chancellor to suggest
that after 11 years in office, his days are numbered.
Even the died-in-the-wool conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ),
normally a loyal supporter of the liberal-conservative government, last week
led its front page with a story comparing the state of the coalition to the
dying days of the SPD-FDP regime in 1982.
It seems that the imperturbable chancellor is finally looking vulnerable.
Even if he refuses to panic, his coalition colleagues and partners are
showing severe signs of perceiving their impending doom. Mr Karl Feldmeyer,
political correspondent of the FAZ, says that the mood of defeatism within
the CDU is growing. 'Experienced CDU politicians will privately admit their
own despondency, even resignation,' he says. 'They don't see any chance of
winning the next federal elections.'
Perhaps the Heitmann debacle was the most devastating blow of all, for it
showed Mr Kohl to be fallible in the one area on which he has always prided
himself as a supreme tactician: the placing of the right people in the right
jobs.
Mr Kohl was sharply criticised from the back benches of his own
parliamentary group when the decision was announced - and not from the
liberal wing of the party, which always disliked Mr Heitmann, but from the
conservatives who wanted to support him.
With no fewer than 19 elections scheduled for the next 11 months,
grass-roots officials of the CDU, its Bavaria-based sister party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), and the liberal FDP are living in fear of a
drubbing at the polls. 'It does not really matter if this coalition
collapses now, or if it drags on till next October's general election. We
are still going to lose,' says one gloomy local official from Lower Saxony,
where the first round of state elections will be held in March.
In both elections this autumn - first in Hamburg, in September, and now in
eastern Brandenburg - the CDU and FDP have trailed far behind the opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD).
Professor Kurt Biedenkopf, the CDU premier of Saxony and, it must be said, a
long-standing and bitter rival of Mr Kohl, has stated publicly he believes
the SPD will emerge as the dominant party in a grand coalition with the CDU
next October. He fears that the loss of only two state elections - most
probably Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, both in east Germany -
will give the SPD a two-thirds majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of
the federal parliament. That would give the opposition a stranglehold on all
government legislation, even if the CDU and FDP can scrape up a majority in
the Bundestag.
Mr Kohl flatly and furiously disagrees. Rumours of a coalition collapse, the
end of the government, and the demise of the chancellor, were 'wrong three
times over', he declared in a tough-talking television interview last night.
Nobody could foretell the results of next year's elections, not even
Professor Biedenkopf, he said.
The question is whether Mr Kohl, with all his immense political experience
and cunning, can reverse the downward trend in the polls when the current
election arithmetic points, at best, to a grand coalition with the SPD, and
at worst, outright defeat for the ruling parties.
Up till now, Mr Kohl has been in the enviable position of having no obvious
rivals for his job. Within his own party he has disposed of all possible
challengers such as Mr Biedenkopf, banishing them to the back benches or the
provinces.
Only Mr Wolfgang Schauble remains, his able, popular and apparently loyal
lieutenant as leader of the parliamentary party. Asked if he would lead a
coup against his leader, one party insider insists: 'He knows too well that
Brutus never succeeded Caesar.' There is also doubt about his physical
stamina - he remains wheelchair-bound, since he was victim of an
assassination attempt in 1990.
What has caused the muttering in coalition ranks is rather the increasingly
impressive performance of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the 45-year-old leader of the
SPD. In the five months since June, when he was elected leader of a
rudderless, quarrelling opposition, which had failed consistently to exploit
the obvious unpopularity of the government, he has succeeded in bringing
order to the chaos.
At the party conference in Wiesbaden three weeks ago, he won a clear mandate
for a tough, conservative financial policy from a future SPD government, and
support for a firm law-and-order campaign. Himself a worthy but uninspiring
speaker, he has managed to forge an apparently solid alliance with the
mercurial but persuasive Mr Oskar Lafontaine as his deputy.
The opposition still has a long way to go to prove it is 'fit for
government' to a disgruntled German electorate.
The last opinion poll by the Allensbach institute, the research
organisation, put the CDU/CSU on 35.7 per cent in west Germany, against 36
per cent for the SPD. In the midst of the sharpest economic downturn since
the war, the opposition should be doing much better.
In east Germany, however, the CDU is trailing far behind the SPD, with just
19.7 per cent against 32.1 per cent for the opposition. And that is where
the crunch may come.
Mr Kohl has bought himself a little time. He is expecting to lose the state
elections in Lower Saxony in March to the incumbent SPD. But he has headed
off the danger of a simultaneous poll in Saxony-Anhalt which might have
created an unstoppable momentum for the opposition. It now looks probable
that the CDU-FDP coalition there will limp on until the autumn.
The chancellor's hopes are now pinned on three things: a recovery of the
German economy; the desire of electors to return to the familiarity and
security of the ruling coalition at national, rather than local, elections;
and his own ruthless political instincts in a frantic election year.
Neither of the first two can yet be guaranteed. As for the third, Mr Kohl
has only survived so long in German politics by being continually
underestimated. He is unlikely to make the same mistake about the forces
ranged against him.

The British Association of Hotel Accountants has spent two years drawing up
new guidelines for surveyors who have to value hotels - it is to be hoped -
accurately. But will it do any good?
The BAHA committee which drew up the guidelines includes a director of
Queens Moat Houses, the heavily indebted hotel chain that commissioned two
valuations last year from two different firms which came in nearly Pounds
500m apart. Who else sat on or advised the committee? Representatives from
both those firms: Jones Lang Wootton and Weatherall Green &amp; Smith.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Akio Morita, Sony's 72-year-old chairman, has fallen ill at a particularly
inopportune moment.
Until he collapsed with a brain haemorrhage last week, Morita was hotly
tipped to succeed the 78-year-old Gaishi Hiraiwa as chairman of the
Keidanren, Japan's powerful business federation, on Hiraiwa's retirement
next year.
Bringing in the self-made electronics industry boss would have been a big
change from Keidanren's traditional reliance on filling the top job with
salarymen from older industries.
Hiraiwa started his career as a washing machine salesman, eventually working
his way up the salaryman ladder to the top of the giant Tokyo Electric
Power.
Morita's straight talking, his outspoken condemnation of protectionism and
his fearless criticism of US and European management failings all strongly
contrast with Hiraiwa's courtly diplomatic style.
Nobody knows whether or not Morita will eventually recover sufficiently to
be able to take the Keidanren job; but it's looking unlikely.
If he does bow out, a discreet competition can now be expected between the
four runners-up: Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota; Shoichi Saba, an
adviser to Toshiba; Hiroshi Saito, chairman of Nippon Steel; and Yotaro
Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - all stalwarts of the grand
old schools of Japanese industry.

Then the group's holding company announces it is giving up its expensive

Robert Louis-Dreyfus tried but failed to achieve.
The annual running costs of Berkeley Square are rumoured to be about Pounds
15m, yet its contribution to overall group activity was always a little

Michael Heseltine is a busy man. Not content with being Britain's secretary

 -he is also now substitute for the foreign office's centre forward, Douglas
Hurd.
Yesterday Hurd had to miss a European Union foreign ministers' meeting on
Gatt in order to address Parliament on Hong Kong. Hurd's EU place was nobly
taken by Heseltine, known as Tarzan by sections of the British media, who
swung into action.
The Foreign Office denies that David Heathcote-Amory, Britain's EU minister,
was thereby snubbed. 'An entirely normal' switch, given Tarzan's trade
interests, it says. So normal in fact that the FCO couldn't recall a
previous example of it ever happening.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Observer: Mrs Volvo speaks out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However hard Volvo's So ren Gyll may protest that he has not betrayed his
chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, during Volvo's ill-fated plan to merge with
Renault, he is never going to satisfy Mrs Christina Gyllenhammar.
In a bitter letter in yesterday's Gothenburg Post, Mrs Gyllenhammar accused
Gyll of using the merger issue to take over Volvo from her husband. 'You
realised that you could use it to get more power - not through something you
built up yourself, but through using something someone else had created,'
she wrote.
'At no time did you turn to your chairman for his help in discussing and
tackling the situation. You blew up the criticism and opposition (to the
merger) which would lead to a more certain 'no' at the shareholder meeting.'
For good measure, she also took a swipe at 'backward-looking and nostalgic'
former Volvo executives, such as former chief executive Gunnar Johansson,
who were prominent critics of the merger.
Her fury has more resonance than the pique of a wounded spouse. Mrs G's
father, Gunnar Engellau, led Volvo from 1956 until he was succeeded by his
son-in-law in 1971. In answer to the obvious question, Mrs Gyllenhammar
stressed she was not speaking for her husband but felt moved to break a
40-year vow of silence on Volvo matters for the sake of 'my conscience and
my family's honour'.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Leading Article: The dangers of delay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Monday is supposed to be a momentous day in Middle East history. Three
months ago, standing on the White House lawn, the leaders of Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation set it as the date when they would start
implementing their peace agreement. By then, they would have negotiated a
detailed interim agreement for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from
the occupied Gaza Strip and from an enclave around the West Bank town of
Jericho, and for the establishment of a Palestinian self-governing authority
in the areas so vacated. The first opportunity for these historic enemies to
prove they could live as neighbours would be at hand, and further Israeli
treaties with Jordan, Syria and Lebanon might conceivably lie around the
corner.
This week's reality seems far removed from that euphoric moment.
Negotiations on arrangements for Israeli withdrawal are making heavy
weather, with the parties apparently far apart on such fundamental issues as
the precise West Bank area from which Israel is supposed to be pulling out
and the position of Jewish settlements within areas under future Palestinian
control. As the danger grows that the peace timetable to which Mr Yitzhak
Rabin of Israel and Mr Yassir Arafat of the PLO committed themselves on
September 13 will slip, so, too, does the risk to the peace process as a
whole.
Detailed agreements
Already, depressingly familiar reflexes are coming to the fore. A spiral of
violence in the occupied territories and in Israel proper has claimed 32
Palestinian lives and 16 Israeli ones since the peace agreement was signed.
Partly as a result, support for the peace process in Israel has slipped. In
the absence of tangible benefits on the ground, dissension among
Palestinians in the occupied territories and within the PLO is reaching a
new pitch. And a more comprehensive Middle East peace continues to move at
the barely visible pace of its slowest but most important partners, Israel
and Syria.
None of these developments has yet put the prospects of peace in terminal
jeopardy. Israel and the PLO have managed in recent weeks to reach detailed
agreements on self-rule and security in the Gaza Strip, and are pressing
ahead with talks on Jericho and on economic relations. Mr Warren
Christopher, US Secretary of State, is in the region attempting to nudge
things forward.
Nevertheless, if the Israeli-PLO timetable does slip, it will be an ominous
sign. Setting a date for withdrawal of troops was itself the most important
earnest of Israel's intent. Mr Rabin may argue that the really important
date is not December 13 but April 13, when Israel has promised to complete
its pull-out, and that he would rather have a precise and well-formulated
agreement than a rushed and incomplete one. But he should know that in the
Middle East, time is always a luxury. There are two particular dangers in
the current delay. One is that some particularly horrific act of violence
will reverse the momentum towards peace. The other is that Israel will not
have a credible Palestinian negotiating partner.
Unequal affair
This peace agreement has always been an unequal affair, with Mr Rabin
negotiating from strength and Mr Arafat from a position of abject weakness.
Since its conclusion, however, the difficulties on the Palestinian side have
multiplied. To be sure, these problems are in large part of Mr Arafat's own
making: even close colleagues who support the peace deal now accuse him of
bungling its aftermath by monopolising decision-making and failing to set up
a sensible institutional framework for self-rule. None of this augurs well
for the PLO chairman in his forthcoming guise as de facto governor of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Yet the fact remains that Mr Arafat is the only person who could have struck
the Palestinian side of the Washington agreement, and is still the only
leader who can keep enough of the movement together to deliver on the PLO's
promises. In the next few days, both Israel and the PLO must make a
redoubled effort to reach agreement in time to start at least a limited
withdrawal next week. But if they fail, Mr Rabin must be ready with
alternative signals that the process remains on course. What cannot be
allowed to happen is an uncontrolled slippage.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Personal View: An offer the unemployed cannot refuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAYARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next weekend European leaders will again discuss Mr Jacques Delors'
unemployment proposals. Last time around work-sharing proposals were
rejected as too pessimistic. So the search has been on for something more
positive.
Unemployment can be understood only by looking at how the labour market is
functioning. Above all, unemployment is profoundly affected by how people
are treated.
If benefits are available indefinitely, unemployment is likely to be high.
In most of the European Union benefits are available for many years, whereas
in the US and Japan they end after six months. So it is not surprising that
in the past 10 years long-term unemployment (of more than one year) has
averaged 5 per cent of the workforce in the European Union compared with 1
per cent in the US and  1/2 per cent in Japan (see chart).
So one option is to cut off benefits after some interval and leave the
unemployed to sink or swim. This is the American way, but it has helped to
make wages in the US twice as unequal as European wages.
The way of the underclass is not for Europe. Instead we should treat people
as our chief resource and make them employable at a decent wage. This can
only be done by a new approach that helps them to earn a proper standard of
living.
Europe's central aim should be to prevent long-term unemployment. If
employees are out of work for longer than a year, they lose skills and work
habits and cease to be attractive to employers. So their unemployment does
nothing to restrain inflation.
Unemployment can only be eliminated by a concerted effort over a run of
years, but Europe's leaders should now commit their countries to preventing
long-term unemployment by the end of the century. How? Here is one way.
The state would guarantee temporary work (say of six months) to everybody
who is still unemployed after a year. Companies and public organisations
would be invited to employ such people at no cost. The state would continue
paying what it would have paid to the unemployed anyway, plus some top-up.
In return unemployed people would have to accept any reasonable offer. After
the first year they could no longer draw benefits for doing nothing.
The advantages of this approach would be huge. Those in temporary work would
be producing something and they would gain valuable experience. By
preventing long-term unemployment Europe would be able to increase
employment by at least 4 per cent. Output would go up by at least 2 per
cent, and this gain would far outweigh the cost of organising the extra
work.
Even governments would gain. They would collect more taxes and save
substantially on benefits, at the cost of some extra administration.
One objection to this strategy is that improving the job chances of some
people would worsen those of others. But over a 10-year period employment is
determined not by demand but by the number of employable people. If more
people are employable, more jobs will be created. This should be the
starting point for Mr Delors' proposals.
As usual, the guide to good policy is to spot the market failure and to
correct it. Unemployment benefits are justified on equity grounds, but it is
absurd to go on paying people to do nothing when employers would be willing
to give them jobs at little extra cost to the state.
When our leaders meet at the European summit, they should concentrate on
removing these absurdities.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Euro-plug plan would be dangerous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M J DAVISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your UK News 'Inventor scorns worries about cost of Euro-plug'
(November 29) you quote the views of an individual called Mr Simon Hossack
who, it appears, is in disagreement with the whole of the UK electrical
industry and many truly independent organisations such as the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accidents.
The plain facts are:
1. The proposed harmonised standard is dangerously compatible with the
British 13 amp system, which after nearly 50 years is now installed in
virtually all buildings in the UK; a system which, incidentally, is widely
recognised as probably the safest in the world.
2. British manufacturing industry would be severely disadvantaged by the
adoption of the Euro proposal because, unlike the French, German, Spanish,
Italians and so on, we would be faced with massive retooling and plant
replacement costs.
3. The British consumer will face an astronomic bill for replacing all plugs
and sockets and, in due course, wiring, or have a house full of adaptors for
no reason and no benefit.
My company is generally in favour of harmonisation of standards where a
rational case exists for change - indeed, many of my colleagues who are
technical experts in these matters are actively involved in numerous
European and international committees pursuing worth-while product
standard-ising.
However, we will actively oppose harmonisation for its own sake, especially
when lives and purses of British consumers can be proved to be at great risk
and the employment of 20,000 UK citizens is in question.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Sour milk and apple pie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question to ask about Gatt is not whether it will add a nice round sum
in billions to world output, but what it will do for breast-feeding. The
European Union has demonstrated that it can safeguard mothers' milk. Will
newborns be able to rely on the protection of the Multilateral Trade
Organisation due to be set up to enforce Gatt rules if/when the Uruguay
Round of trade talks ends in triumph next week?
Maybe not. Let me explain. You may recall the worldwide criticism of Nestle,
the Swiss-based food company, for its sales of infant formula in developing
countries. The argument ran thus: all mothers lose their own milk very
quickly when their offspring are put on the bottle. They are then obliged to
buy baby milk. If the producers of bottle-food give it away to new mothers
they capture the market. When this happens in poverty-stricken families in,
say, Africa the half-starved parents face what is to them a huge bill. They
eke out the baby food mix they must buy. It is often over-diluted, probably
with unclean water. Many babies die, either of malnutrition or infection.
To save Nestle the trouble of faxing in a hot protest I gave them a call. Mr
Peter Blackburn, the UK chairman and managing director, says that the
company meets World Health Organisation standards on sales and packaging,
and that it is working with other manufacturers, governments, the WHO and
the United Nations Children's fund to phase out free supplies to maternity
wards in developing countries. He can count 127 countries in which there are
either phase-out agreements now signed or where there was no free or
subsidised marketing in the first place. Mr Blackburn is trying to talk the
Church of England and university students out of their boycott of Nestle's
instant coffee. Fortunately at my house we mostly use grounds and a filter,
so the difficult decision of whether or not to buy Nescafe has rarely been
faced. Researching for this article, I found a jar of Gold Blend in our
kitchen cupboard.
I suspect that Nestle, having been given a huge fright in the 1970s, has
spent the past decade in an earnest effort to shake this problem off. It is
being helped by regulation, not free trade. Thanks to the European Union the
message 'breast milk is best' will appear on all baby milk labels in Britain
after June 1994. This will not affect Nestle UK, which does not market the
stuff here. The new regulations, available in draft form last week, disallow
idealistic pictures of smiling babies on the packet. The deciding vote came
in the European Parliament in April 1992. Oxfam is pleased. So am I.
Now picture the scene when the new, improved Gatt comes to rule our lives.
So far as can be divined at this stage, the plan is to arrange global food
standards through a United Nations body, the Codex Alimentarius commission.
It will probably supersede the EU mechanism in Europe, although even now, in
the final weeks of the negotiations, such details are uncertain. The Codex
is run jointly by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. It is a
large, slow-moving body whose procedures may be susceptible to influence by
large, fast-moving international companies.
Do not mistake me, I have not seen any evidence to the effect that the Codex
is the tool of rampant, anarchic capitalists, or, for that matter, wide-eyed
anti-growth greens. What we do have is an analysis of the commission's 19th
session, which ran from 1989 to 1991*. Its authors list the representatives
who attended committee meetings in those years. Their tables indicate that
while 445 non-governmental participants on national delegations represented
industry, only 8 represented public interest groups. The top 15
international food companies sent 85 delegates, 38 of them from Nestle, 18
from Coca Cola, and others from Philip Morris (Kraft), Unilever, Pepsico and
the like.
You could interpret such figures any way you choose. The company
representatives may seek decent standards, in the hope that their particular
industry will thus retain customers, while regulation will keep the playing
field level. Against that, you might wonder whether the pressure on
standards is likely to be downwards, in the short-sighted interest of
immediate profits. Sensible companies will take the first view, spurred on
by fear of being found out. The others will go for greed and take us to
perdition with them.
The above brief exposition should convince you that the negotiations that
follow the conclusion of the Uruguay Round could be more important for the
well-being of the world's people than the round itself. We live in a world
in which free trade between liberal economies is assumed to be the optimum
recipe for human happiness. It may be - but only if the boundaries of
regulation, and public accountability, are properly drawn.
Public accountability? On some interpretations the proposed MTO, son of
Gatt, could make the Brussels Commission seem reticent, not to say feeble.
At least the Commission's acts are eventually unmasked. They are debated in
the European Parliament. They are supervised by member governments, acting
in councils of ministers. Who knows what the MTO will be able to do? Will it
be the old Gatt writ large? As to democratic oversight - a motion on the
order paper designating a few hours debate on international trade is
guaranteed to empty the British House of Commons.
It is different in France. The French minister of foreign affairs, Mr Alain
Juppe, told Les Echos the other day that the core issue in the Gatt
negotiation is the 'world trade organisation. The day after an agreement is
reached . . . we would like to see rules in place, applicable to all,
embracing new concerns, especially in the social, ecological and monetary
spheres . . .' Anglo-Saxons may expostulate that this is typical of French
statism, but such new rules will certainly be proposed in subsequent Gatt
negotiations. The environment, which may get only a token mention in the
preamble to the MTO charter, will surely be the subject of a new round of
talks. Quite right too. A Gatt deal next week may be apple pie, as
conventional wisdom has it, but it is not yet motherhood.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Golden years are tarnished: Venezuela's election raises
questions about Latin American reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three-quarters of Venezuela's 20m people are under 35, yet the country has
just elected a president who first ran for the office in 1947, the year
after US President Bill Clinton was born.
Rafael Caldera is 78 next month and first made his mark on Venezuelan
politics when Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House. In February, he is
scheduled to take over a country that in the past two years has become one
of the most politically volatile in Latin America.
Last year there were two attempted military coups in the continent's biggest
oil-exporting country; this year, there have been three presidents, because
President Carlos Andres Perez - Caldera's great political rival - was ousted
in a corruption scandal.
The victory of the man who has led the 'cockroach coalition' of 17 parties
through the election campaign, will be felt beyond Venezuela's borders. It
is the first electoral triumph of a presidential candidate in a leading
Latin American economy who is explicitly opposed to the market-oriented
economic reforms which have characterised much of the region since the
mid-1980s. In the view of some observers, Caldera's win threatens such
policies - tight budget control, privatisation programmes, the free movement
of capital and lowering of tariffs.
'This election, along with other developments, shows that economic reforms
have not been consolidated in Latin America,' said Sebastian Edwards, chief
Latin American economist at the World Bank. He cited other examples of the
vulnerability of the reform impetus: President Alberto Fujimori's narrow
referendum victory in Peru on October 31, and the marked popularity in
Brazil of the left-wing politician 'Lula' - Luis Inacio de Silva - ahead of
elections in Brazil next October.
Economic liberalisation appears more deep-seated in Chile, where
presidential elections on Saturday are not expected to yield big changes in
policy; in Mexico, where next August's elections should result in a victory
for the pro-reform government candidate; and, debatably, in Argentina, where
the pro-market government of Carlos Menem has been consolidating its
authority. But in most other countries there are questions about the
durability of reforms.
'It's likely that Caldera will implement a number of measures that will
signify a slowdown - if not a total reversal - of some of the economic
reforms of the last few years,' said Edwards. 'I think this will provide
some kind of signal to other politicians in the region.'
Oil price weakness is likely to be the main constraint on Caldera if it
persists into next year: oil accounts for two-thirds of Venezuela's exports
and, in the face of one of the lowest tax collection rates in the world, is
still a principal source of government revenue.
Yet foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 12bn, equivalent to nine months of
imports, may give him a cushion to follow his populist election promises.
But first, he will have to resolve differences with the ostensibly
independent central bank, headed by Ruth de Krivoy. One banker in Caracas
declared this year that, if Caldera became president, 'Ruth de Krivoy is
history'. Yet Caldera said yesterday that an independent central bank was
'absolutely indispensable'.
If she insists on keeping monetary policy tight, high interest rates may
choke off growth and imperil Caldera's hitherto hazy economic policy plans.
While he has been fiercely critical of the reforms introduced by Perez, his
advisers have been travelling around the world's financial centres, telling
investors and bankers that many of them will stay in place.
Caldera repeated at the weekend that he would abolish the value-added tax
introduced by the current interim government to help close the budget
deficit which is expected to equal about 9 or 10 per cent of gross domestic
product this year. He promised to replace it by a tax that falls more
heavily on the wealthy. He pledged to improve tax collection. He also vowed
to rid the government of inefficiency and corruption, and to cut government
spending by 10 per cent, without sacking employees or cutting their
salaries. He has given the impression, if not stated explicitly, that he
would not raise petrol prices which are among the lowest in the world, and
would slow if not halt the privatisation process.
To many market economists this has the makings of failure, but Caldera does
not appear impressed by now-conventional economic wisdom. Yet if he decides
economic orthodoxy is the only answer to depleted public finances, voters
might feel once again that they have been double-crossed, as they did with
Perez. Perez was elected on a populist platform in 1989, but on taking
office saw economic reform as the only way to rescue a bankrupt state. The
measures he introduced, including the abolition of food subsidies, triggered
riots in February 1989 in which more than 300 people died.
Caldera could be in the same tight corner. Mr Anibal Romero, an academic and
political opponent, said yesterday: 'If Caldera does what he said he was
going to do in the campaign, it's bad; and if he doesn't do it, it's also
bad.'
Caldera's minority support - he was elected with at most 35 per cent of the
vote - could make it difficult to govern. Furthermore, while the make-up of
Congress is still uncertain, some political observers fear the breaking of
the old two-party system will result in a fractious and fragmented
legislature in the Brazilian style. If this is so - and Caldera has said he
hopes to build alliances - legislation of any kind will not be easy.
Moreover, some of the problems Caldera will face are perhaps more grave than
those faced by his predecessor. The decay of the institutions of state -
including the military - has not been arrested by the reforms of the Perez
years. Public services have deteriorated and, said Edwards of the World
Bank, the quality of education is now among the lowest in Latin America.
Caldera's main quality in tackling both economic and political issues is a
reputation for integrity. If his opponents say he is a vengeful man, they
also recognise his almost puritanical streak. He thus carries a moral
authority absent from the administrations of Perez and Jaime Lusinchi, both
enveloped in corruption allegations.
This is one reason why Venezuela's youthful population voted for him on
Saturday. Another, said Moises Naim, a former industry minister in the Perez
government and now a visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in
Washington, is nostalgia - he was in office between 1969 and 1974.
Caldera - described in one newspaper yesterday as Venezuela's last caudillo
 -offers a return to the golden years of the 1970s, when oil prices and
Venezuelans' standard of living rose rapidly. But as the population may soon
find out, trying to turning the clock back will not resolve the difficulties
of the future.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: SIB tackling pensions transfer
problem from wrong end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T S SHUCKSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Securities and Investment Board is attacking the problem of people
disadvantaged by taking transfer payments from occupational to personal
pension schemes from the wrong end.
The real problem is with the cash equivalents of the deferred benefits given
up. I expect parliament intended that deferred pensioners should be able to
rely on transfer payments being fair and that they would not need to obtain
advice on the adequacy of transfer payments offered.
Cash equivalents are not defined in the legislation, a point on which the
Goode Report failed to comment. The basis of cash equivalents is decided by
the scheme's actuary under professional guidance notes. According to the
Institute of Actuaries one of the purposes of the guidelines is 'to ensure
that members of retirement benefit schemes exercising a right to a transfer
value can be assured that it fairly reflects their reasonable expectation of
benefits otherwise available on withdrawal'.
If this purpose were fulfilled a member would not need to worry about loss
of value on transferring to a personal pension plan, but merely the choice
of the best plan.
However, parliament's intention and the institute's guidance sadly appear
not to be working. The matter is, in practice, a minefield and the member
contemplating a transfer needs an adviser with the technical skill of an
actuary, the wisdom of Socrates and the knowledge of Jove.
The problem goes much deeper than the SIB may think.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK MCINTOSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hope that your newspaper will take every step to publicise the lunacy
of the outcome of the Levitt trial.
What faith can anybody have in a regulatory system that appears to disregard
the need to ensure that cases of this nature are examined thoroughly and
fully.
Plea bargaining should not have been allowed for several reasons:
l. To ensure that the widest publicity was given to this case.
2. To ensure that all the regulatory systems could learn from the experience
and understand what had gone on and how it could be avoided in the future.
3. To ensure that the people who are supposed to be protected by the
regulatory system can have confidence and faith in that system.
This apparent failure by the Serious Fraud Office brings forward the day for
government legislation as self-regulation is clearly not working.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pension proposals are a good start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK RITTNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Maples's pension reform proposals (Personal View, November 12)
deserve a more thoughtful response than the knee-jerk defence of the status
quo by Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds
(Letters, November 16).
John Plender has highlighted some of the problems of an unreformed system.
Maples's ideas do not go far enough. The pensions industry is bedevilled by
rules and regulations running to 1,600 pages, much of it unintelligible even
to experienced practitioners.
The Maples reform should be completed by removing totally the limitation on
the level of occupational pension that an employer can provide.
The restriction should be solely on the percentage of salary that an
employer and employee can contribute to a pension fund. The levels should be
set at a percentage at least as high as those available to the self-employed
on an age-related basis under the personal pension rules. If the pension
fund performs well, why should not the employee benefit?
One more reform is needed. Employers should also be obliged to make minimum
pension contributions on behalf of all employees with more than two years'
continuous employment, and they should be obliged to pay this either to the
company scheme or to an employee's personal pension plan, if that is the
wish of the employee. In this way we would begin to move towards real
portability and transparency and reverse the creeping corporatism of the
pension industry.
The present system, with its concentration of such vast wealth and power in
the hands of very few unaccountable institutions, is the antithesis of Tory
philosophy, be it wet, dry, left or right. The late Philip Chappell
understood this only too well and John Maples's proposals are very much in
the spirit of Philip's ideas.
At the moment the pensions debate is bedevilled by too many corporate vested
interests and too many government departments tinkering with ad hoc reforms.
Responsibility for reform must be centred in one ministry, either the
Treasury or Department of Social Security, but not both and a raft of
quangos. One minister at minister of state level should be given the task of
restructuring state and private pensions over the next couple of years.
All bets should be off and the aim should be for simplicity and less not
more legislation and regulation. John Maples has provided an excellent
start.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: TGVs keep better time than stated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEAN-PIERRE LOUBINOUX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letter from Ian MacKellar that you carried under the heading 'Not
really. . . ' on November 24 contains a serious inaccuracy in the number of
TGVs (Train a Grande Vitesse) arriving at their destination within 14
minutes of their scheduled time.
The figure, quoted at 74.9 per cent, is in fact 91.8 per cent for TGV Sud
Est and 96.8 per cent for TGV Atlantique. And I must add for the comparison
to be accurate that the SNCF runs 1,300 intercity trains daily.
The letter also implies that TGV is subsidised by the French government.
This is most definitely not the case. State subsidy is more by way of a
grant which is channelled into the 'social railway' and not into mainline
services.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: Canaletto's view of the English landscape - Patricia
Morison visits the inaugural exhibition in the converted Gas Hall,
Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham's high profile as a city which has lavished money on the arts is,
from some angles, hideous - such as the new Convention Centre and Raymond
Mason's pink fibre-glass sculpture outside it, my candidate for the most
repellent work of public art. Happily, everyone can unite in welcoming the
latest addition to Birmingham's cultural scene, the splendid Gas Hall
Exhibition Gallery.
The old turn-of-the-century Gas Hall has been turned into a spacious
exhibition gallery of 1,000 square metres. Renovated and designed by
architects Stanton Williams, the entrance way is dull, but never mind. The
Edwardian interior with its triple aisles and pillars, terrific for
sculpture, makes an attractive and versatile space for visiting exhibitions.
It cost Pounds 4m; Pounds 1.8m from the EC, Pounds 1.15m from the city, the
rest from an appeal now close to its Pounds 1m target. State-of-the-art
air-conditioning means that Birmingham will be able to bid for the grandest
international travelling art shows.
There could be no better house-warming than Canaletto and England, an
exhibition which is beautiful, full of interest, and has a really good
catalogue. Yet the show is not just about Canaletto, even though there are
over 30 of his paintings, among them some of the best in the country and
some from private collections. It is also about the influence of Canaletto
on a host of artists from Samuel Scott and Rowlandson to Girtin, Bonington
and Turner.
Part of the show's interest comes from deciding how fully you accept its
curators' thesis that Canaletto deserves the credit for giving English
mid-18th-century topographical painting a much-needed shot in the arm. Was
Piranesi not quite as important, you may ask. In the end, are not the echoes
of Canaletto less striking than the differences between his view of the
English scene and the evolving native tradition?
Canaletto came to England in 1746. It was his first and only visit abroad,
and the motive was money. George Vertue, a great source of gossip on the
London art world, thought that Canaletto was attracted by the English stock
market which offered 'better Security or better interest than abroad'.
However, the fundamental reason for the trip was that business in Venice was
flat.
How well Canaletto deserved his fame in the 1720s and 1730s is shown by a
small, well-chosen group beginning with the 'Allegorical Tomb of Lord
Somers'. This piece of rococo theatre (rather badly lit) is on long loan to
Birmingham and belongs to the speculative series of sepulchral tributes to
British Worthies commissioned by the Irish impresario, MacSwiney.
For sheer magic, nothing in the exhibition can beat a pen-and-ink drawing of
San Michele from the Ashmolean, every line wiggling as if the world were
merely a watery reflection. Engravings of such scenes allowed the modestly
rich man to have a souvenir. But the elite who made the Grand Tour simply
had to have their Canaletto oil, like the pair of hot, colourful views of
the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge bought by the Earl of Leicester. They
bought Canalettos very nearly by the yard.
By 1746, Canaletto had saturated the market with Venetian views and war had
checked the tourist flow. The artist's energetic agent, Consul Joseph Smith,
knew that the Whig grandees were modernising London with impressive projects
such as the building of Westminster Bridge. They were pouring money into
their country seats and landscaping the grounds and surely would jump at
having Canaletto on hand to record their triumphs?
They did, although perhaps with not quite the eagerness expected. In eight
years he sold more than 60 paintings as well as etchings and finished
drawings. Yet there were low points when business was thin. Was it cause or
effect that, as the exhibition clearly demonstrates, some of Canaletto's
English scenes are damned dull?
It was not surprising that Canaletto had trouble in adapting to England. His
unique talent was for capturing the duet between blue sky and Venice's
sparkling water. England's cloudscapes, London's cobbles and mud, were not
at all the same thing. Spiteful comment even suggested that he was an
impostor. 'The Old Horse Guards from St James's Park', bought by Sir Andrew
Lloyd Webber for the astounding figure of Pounds 10.12m, is certainly large
but it lacks charm. The trouble may have been that Canaletto was not trying
to please anyone in particular. He simply painted the canvas and advertised
it in The Daily Advertiser.
One odd feature of Canaletto's views of England is that he seems almost
never to have showed horses. I spotted just one in a Canaletto drawing,
although he often included dogs and urinating men. Both men and dogs had
often appeared in Venetian vedute where as horses, of course, had not: was
this one consequence of changing places to which the Venetian could not
adjust?
Ladies' crinolines, however, he seized on as a way to enliven foregrounds
with bold blobs of pink, white, blue and lemon. The crinoline dodge works
well in his paintings of Warwick Castle and still better in the view of the
Thames from the Duke of Richmond's riverside palace. When we look at this
ravishing pair from Goodwood, it seems mad to think that Canaletto was past
his best.
But then, Canaletto was new to London and desperate to impress the duke, his
best contact. He painted one view from an upstairs window, looking north up
Whitehall at the vestiges of Tudor London, soon to be swept away. In the
view from the terrace, Canaletto has the Thames as his accomplice. The water
is a mesmerically beautiful lilac, with squiggles of grey suggesting the
pull of the tide. The sky, of course, is that brilliant blue which tells us
that in reality, the duke had bought himself a stretch of Venice-on-Thames.
Sponsored by British Gas. Exhibition runs until January 9. Meanwhile in
London there are many Canalettos in George III and Consul Smith at the
Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, until December 23.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Gypsy' shows its class - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The famous 1960 musical Gypsy is many things. It is the
Cinderella-to-celebrity biography of the stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. It is
also, more importantly, an expose of the last days of American vaudeville,
in which Gypsy (then Louise Hovick) received her training as a child
performer. More vividly yet, it is simply a let's-get-this-show-on-the-road
backstage musical - in which the show only takes flight when everyone has
lost faith in it, and in a form nobody had imagined (striptease).
But all that could just be read as metaphor. We follow the story of Gypsy's
early career the way we watch all ugly-duckling stories - as a parable for a
child's transformation into adult maturity. The highly ironic fact that
Gypsy shakes off her immaturity when she becomes a stripper adds a layer of
sexual meaning to the story of growing-up: the girl becomes a woman by
learning to please men, by enjoying that, and by being in control of the
situation.
The brilliance of Gypsy lies in that it is, above all, about the girl's
mother, and about the course of her maternal ambition. When Gypsy finally
becomes a star - and a sexual being - the show homes in on her mother's
sudden frustration. Here is a classic demonstration of a parent finding
herself superfluous (I gave you life, I taught you everything, I created you
 -how dare you be independent?) Very skilfully, Gypsy shows us this from
both sides - mother and child.
In most respects, Jude Kelly's staging for the West Yorkshire Playhouse is
first-rate. Paul Andrews' sets fluently conjure up scene upon scene of
midwar America. Terry John Bates' choreography is wholly worthy of the show
(which was originally directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins); little
June's high kicks are ideally ludicrous and musical. Jane Arden and Marsha
Ward, excellent as Louise and June, sing 'Little Lamb', 'If Mama was
Married' and the old chestnut 'Let me Entertain You' with complete command.
Supporting roles are well taken. American accents, though imperfect, are
seldom a problem (some minor syllables get slurred into inaudibility, even
by the leading performers).
Sheila Hancock takes the part of Mama Rose with splendid attack and verve.
Though she lacks the blast power of Ethel Merman (the original) or even the
sheer force that Tyne Daly displayed in the 1990-91 Broadway revival, she
has always plenty of bite. As yet, however, her pacing is sometimes too pat;
and it is too obvious too soon that her ambition is really for herself.
Michael Cashman gives a wholly grey and lightweight account of her loyal
stooge and lover Herbie - a role that should provide tone and ballast.
(Impossible to believe in any sexual chemistry between them.) And so Gypsy
packs less that its proper psychological punch. Even so, much of it works so
well that this production should be seen. 'You Gotta Get a Gimmick', one of
the surefire numbers of musical theatre, is delicious.
Gypsy is frequently described as a great musical: which it isn't. Could a
great musical end without a song, as this does? In fact, its music (by Jule
Styne) is just vaudeville shlock - effective, charming, undistinguished -
and this very fact helps to make Gypsy perfect. It never lets us make the
mistake of thinking 'With luck, these people could be great theatrical
artists'. There is something humdrum about even their private life: which is
what numbers like 'Small World, isn't it?' catch so well.
The words, you may recall, are by Stephen Sondheim - who after this show was
to grow a lot more clever and a lot less wise. Everything in Gypsy is about
the tension between ambition and achievement. This comes to a climax in
'Rose's Turn', Rose's very tricky soliloquy, in which Hancock suggests that
she really nearly might have 'made it', had only things, from her birth
onward, been different. The irony is tremendous. No, not a great musical,
but a great show.
At the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, 0532-442111, until January 29.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: A triumphant 'Trojans' - Opera in concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first thing to be said about the Barbican concert-performances of
Berlioz's opera Les Troyens at the weekend (in its unequal halves, the fall
of Troy and Aeneas's fateful stopover at Carthage en route to Trojanising
Italy), with Sir Colin Davis conducting the London Symphony &amp; Chorus and 18
finely chosen soloists, is that they were magnificent. The second is that
this memorable experience is on offer twice more: a few lucky readers will
stop reading to ring the Barbican box office (071-638 8891) now. For next
Sunday the diptych is probably sold out, but there might be seats for this
Wednesday/Thursday.
It is a little over 24 years since Davis demonstrated conclusively, at
Covent Garden, that the neglected Troyens was one of the few great 'epic'
operas. Subsequently his recording of the work swept most of the western
musical world and ensured that it never goes long now without performances
in one capital or another. It seems to demand the resources of a big
metropolitan company, though Scottish Opera made a recent and remarkable
case for staging it with thrifty austerity. We have been missing it in
London.
By concert standards, the current Davis performances are sumptuous. Six
harps for La Prise de Troie - chiefly to render even more radiant their
strummed accompaniment for the Trojan women on the brink of mass
self-annihilation; multiple offstage brass, top-calibre, to realise
Berlioz's sound-visions in depth and to crowd into the hall to blow the
final peroration into an overwhelming blaze. With the LSO in superb form
(its flutes, trombones and timpanist distinguished themselves), its chorus
forcefully eloquent beyond almost anything that a 'naturalistic' stage
chorus could achieve, and Davis conducting out of a lifetime of paid-up
addiction to Berlioz, we expected no less.
What was unexpected and quite wonderful was Davis's revelatory account of La
Prise de Troie. Hitherto its two acts have been regarded as a stark,
tight-lipped prologue to the grand romantic action at Carthage. This time
there was dangerous electricity in the Trojan air from the outset; and soon,
with the great 'Dieux protecteurs' choral scena, we found ourselves
confronting a musical vista of extraordinary, tragic depth, a linchpin about
which all the rest revolved.
Conned by the Greeks' mock-retreat and their bequeathal of the Wooden Horse,
the Trojan people sing a paean of thanks to their delivering gods. Yet we
know, and Berlioz knows - and perhaps they guess - that they are already
lost, that the horse will be the engine of their doom. Their words are
triumphal; but their music, veering from bright major-key glare to darker
intimations, conveys noble defiance in the face of inexorable disaster.
Davis spelled it out to profound effect: in a timeless perspective of grief,
but with a brazen panoply of barbaric splendour. For an hour and a half,
this illusory archaic world seized our imaginations and wrenched them hard.
Sir Colin has persuaded us long since that Les Troyens a Carthage, where
Aeneas loves Queen Dido and cruelly leaves her, is a heart-stirring
masterpiece. That might have left his new principal singers just to fill
their slots as dutifully as possible; in fact they all did much more. In
Aeneas's recklessly high-flying music, Vladimir Bogachov went from strength
to strength. There were long passages of strenuously bright, clarion tone in
La Prise, such as only a young tenor heedless of his future could risk
(exactly what the role demands - there is no safe substitute).
Toward the end of Carthage, Bogachov nevertheless tapped new reserves of
power, raising a brave, well-studied performance (plainly after the peerless
but huskier Jon Vickers) to a level of searing directness. Much the same
happened with his Dido, Markella Hatziano, Cardiff's 1983 'Singer of the
World'. Cultivated warmth and invincible dignity from the start, despite
some slippery pitch; later, she expanded into grand, scathing focus when
Dido finds herself forsaken and ruined.
In La Prise, Jane Henschel's ripe Cassandra had done no less, growing into
the stature of ignored, clairvoyant prophetess even while let down by her
patchy French. (Though nobody listens, what she has to say is of the utmost
importance.) As Dido's sister Anna, Maria Popescu boasted not only a svelte,
penetrating contralto, by turns bubbly-urbane and stricken, but the
advantage of being born in Montreal; more than anyone, she brought all her
words to spontaneous life.
Among the minor principals there are no weak links. Young Ian Bostridge (who
made a strange, memorable impression as Young Sailor and Shepherd in the
recent Welser-Most/LPO Tristan) again brings something artfully raw and
touching to Hylas's haunted lullaby, and Gregory Cross makes nearly as much
of the poet Iopas. Fiona James, Alan Ewing and Brian Bannatyne-Scott, not to
mention the seasoned Gwynne Howell, Robert Lloyd and Carlos Alvarez, supply
vital sketches of lesser roles. Everything is held together in Davis's
far-sighted, purposeful grip; these days, Berlioz has no champion like him.
Later performances; December 8/9 and both halves together on the 12th,
sponsored by the Peter Stuyvesant Foundation and the Sema Group.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: Frank Zappa - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Zappa, the guitarist and composer, has died in Los Angeles, aged 52,
from prostate cancer. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, he grew up in southern
California, attending the same high school as Captain Beefheart, aka Don Van
Vliet. His musical career began, legend has it, through a need to pay fines
for his involvement in making porn films. For the record, he began by
co-writing low-budget Western film scores with Beefheart while playing white
soul music in bars. By the mid-1960s Zappa's prodigious talent for the
electric guitar, lyrical innuendo and compositional energy was recognised
and the first of some of 70 disparate albums was recorded.
With his everchanging band, The Mothers of Invention, and records with
titles like 'Burnt Weeny Sandwich', Zappa's crazed collage of jazz
improvisation, doo-wop and fierce electric guitar rock heroics made him an
underground hero. In 1970, increasing interest in major compositional works
brought about the first of many classical collaborations, 200 Motels with
the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Later joint ventures included three volumes
with the London Symphony Orchestra baroque trio recording of the music of
Francesco Zappa (circa 1763) and, most importantly, 'The Perfect Stranger'
with Pierre Boulez and his ensemble Intercontemporain.
But it is the slickly produced and cruelly executed misanthropic rock
anthems of the 1970s and '80s for which Zappa is chiefly remembered: songs
populated by perverts ('The Detroit Enema Bandit') and Middle American
obsessions ('Jesus Thinks You're a Jerk'), with lyrics intoned by a deadpan
Zappa and terrifying solos delivered by stunt sidemen in beautifully
arranged composition.
As well as these scabrous musical observations, he will also be remembered
for a contrary code of ethics which brought him simultaneously into conflict
with the US establishment (over censorship), with hippiedom (over his
contempt for drug culture), and with Cold War eastern bloc governments (over
his funding of alternative art there).
Zappa is survived by his son Dweezil and daughter Moon Unit, who are both
rock musicians.

To the generation of journalists now in middle age, Robert Fisk is what
James Cameron was to the previous generation: a man who seems to have been
in every major war zone for a couple of decades, yet who writes about war
without any of the gung-ho relish common among war reporters.
How he has survived so long on so many fronts is a mystery, though last time
we met he gave a hint. You could always tell the new boys when you came
under heavy attack, he said, they dived for cover the moment they heard the
explosions, but the old hands had gone down a split second sooner, as they
felt the reverberation through the air. Today he begins a three part series
on Islamic fundamentalism, From Beirut To Bosnia (9.00 C4).
There seem to be lots of serious programmes tonight. Assignment (7.35 BBC2)
reports on China's 'economic miracle' but that is followed by Human Rights,
Human Wrongs which includes an assertion from Helen Suzman that torture is
now endemic in China (8.20 BBC2).

FT  07 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: TV listings saga lives on - Robert
Rice reports on a copyright issue before the European court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The five-year television listings battle between British and Irish
television companies and the European Commission returned to the European
Court of Justice last week.
Most people could be forgiven for thinking that the dispute over the refusal
by the BBC, Independent Television Publications, the publisher of TV Times,
and Radio Telefis Eireann (RTE), the Irish broadcaster, to supply scheduling
information to independent listings magazines was a dead issue.
In a sense it is - at least in the UK where, since the 1990 Broadcasting Act
came into force, broadcasters have been required to license their schedules,
in which they have copyright, to other publishers.
But the question of whether a refusal by a copyright owner to authorise
third parties to publish such copyright material can amount to an abuse of a
dominant position outlawed by Rome treaty competition rules is still very
much a live issue. The Commission's view, upheld in 1991 by the Court of
First Instance, is that it can.
If that decision was confined to the narrow issue of TV listings, it would
hardly seem worth pursuing. Indeed, the BBC has dropped out, but RTE and
ITP, which have been joined by Intellectual Property Owners, a
Washington-based lobby organisation, are concerned by the wider implications
of the CFI judgment and have appealed to the full European Court. The oral
hearing was held in Luxembourg last week.
Their concern is that the Commission will use the TV listings case to force
owners of intellectual property rights in other areas, such as computer
software, to license those rights to third parties.
According to Mr Guy Leigh of City solicitors Theodore Goddard, which is
acting for IPO, the danger is that we may be moving towards a system of
compulsory licensing of intellectual property in the European Union in
circumstances where the exercise of those rights is deemed by the Commission
to conflict with EC competition rules.
Lawyers close to the case suggest that the CFI decision leaves it open to
the Commission to act as a compulsory licensing authority in areas such as
telecommunications and computer software.
In the immediate aftermath of the judgment, Sir Leon Brittan, then
competition commissioner, said the Commission intended to use it to open up
these markets.
But since then the Commission appears to have backed away from the idea of
compulsory intellectual property licensing. According to one lawyer, there
is a suggestion in Brussels that a body of opinion within the Commission
legal service does not agree with the legal basis of the CFI's decision. If
this is so, the Commission may see problems in trying to get any wider
application of the compulsory licensing principle past the legal service, he
says.
There also appears to be some confusion within the Commission as to what its
precise role would be in forcing owners of intellectual property rights to
license third parties to manufacture or supply protected products.
It appears prepared to order rights' holders to grant licences but then
shies away from getting involved in setting the terms of those licences. The
current Commission position is that the terms of a licence are a matter for
negotiation between the parties involved and it will only intervene if the
third party complains to it that the terms are unreasonable.
Lawyers say that is a long way from the role of a compulsory licensing
authority.
The TV companies' main ground of appeal to the ECJ is that the CFI
misconstrued the concept of abuse of a dominant position. It was wrong to
rule that the Commission had the power to require the owner of an
intellectual property right to grant compulsory licences.
Their argument for saying this is based on the ECJ's judgment in the 1988
Volvo spare parts case, where the court said that the exercise by the owner
of intellectual property rights of his exclusive right to refuse to grant a
licence cannot of itself amount to abuse of a dominant position under Rome
treaty competition rules.
In the Volvo case, the Swedish car manufacturer launched an action against a
UK distributor of Volvo cars for breach of its registered design in spare
body parts, which the distributor had imported and sold in the UK. The issue
was whether Volvo could be guilty of abuse of a dominant position by
refusing to license others to supply body panels even where they were
willing to pay a reasonable royalty.
The ECJ said the right of an owner of a protected design to prevent others
manufacturing, importing or selling products incorporating the protected
design constituted 'the very subject matter' of his exclusive right. It
followed that an obligation imposed on the owner of the design to license
others to supply products incorporating it, would deprive the owner of the
substance of his exclusive right. A refusal to grant such a licence could
not in itself constitute an abuse of a dominant position.
However, the court went on to say that there were circumstances where the
exercise of such an exclusive right could amount to abuse of a dominant
position under Rome treaty competition rules if it involved abusive conduct
such as:
the arbitrary refusal to supply parts to independent repairers;
the fixing of prices for spare parts at an unfair level; or
the decision no longer to make spare parts for a particular model even
though many cars of that model were still in circulation.
The TV companies admit that when the case began they had a monopoly on their
TV schedules and were thus dominant but, relying on Volvo, argue that their
refusal to license other publishers to use their copyrighted material did
not amount to an abuse caught by European competition rules.
The Commission argues that a licensing policy engaged in by a dominant
company which is discriminatory or involves charging excessive royalties or
is intended to drive a competitor from a market or prevent new competitors
entering the market, may be an abuse of a dominant position under Rome
treaty competition rules.
Its analysis of the Volvo judgment is that the TV companies' refusal to
license other publishers could fall within one of the three exceptions
outlined in Volvo to the general rule that a refusal to grant a licence
cannot of itself amount to an abuse of a dominant position and in any event
that the list of exceptions outlined in Volvo was not exhaustive.
The Commission argues that Magill TV Guide, the Irish publisher which made
the original complaint to Brussels in 1986 after the TV companies had sued
it for publishing full listings of their schedules, was in a similar
position to that of an independent car repairer who is dependent on the
supply of the 'raw material' from the upstream market and is competing with
his supplier.
The Commission maintains that Magill was in an even more disadvantageous
position, being entirely dependent on the broadcasting companies. Without a
licence Magill could do nothing with the supply of information on TV
programmes.
According to ITP's lawyers, Allen &amp; Overy, it is impossible to tell from
last week's oral hearing which way the court will decide. The advocate
general's preliminary opinion will be delivered on February 9. But it seems
hard not to conclude that, if copyright owners cannot refuse to license the
right and exploit it themselves, their intellectual property rights are
being undermined.
