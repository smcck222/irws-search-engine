<TEXT>
They are changing the family guard at Manchester's Paterson Zochonis, one of
the last of Britain's overseas traders. John Zochonis, 64, great nephew of
one of the two founders, has handed over the chairmanship to one of his
three nephews in the family-controlled business - 43-year-old Anthony Green.
Zochonis, an Oxford graduate, joined the family business of West African
merchants in 1952, shortly after the death of his father, and got his early
training serving behind the counter of the company's stores in West Africa.
A shy man who does not seek publicity, he has headed the firm since 1970,
during which time it has changed from being an overseas retailer and
wholesaler to a manufacturer, although West Africa still accounts for the
bulk of the business. In 1975 he masterminded the firm's first big
diversification, the acquisition of Cussons - makers of Imperial Leather
soap.
Anthony Green, the deputy chairman, joined PZ in 1975 and served in East and
West Africa and South East Asia. Zochonis retires from the board, and Thomas
Harrison, the company secretary, joins it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Neil Johnson (right), who left the Engineering Employers Federation last
month after a whirlwind 15 months as director-general, has wasted no time
lining up a new career.
He has been appointed general secretary of the Royal Automobile Club, the
motoring organisation, from February 1, in succession to Michael Limb, who
is to retire the day before after 26 years with the RAC.
Johnson was expected to be in demand after leaving the EEF, but his move to
the RAC comes as a surprise - many had thought he would return to the motor
industry. Before joining the EEF in the summer of 1992, Johnson was a senior
executive at Rover Group, and has spent his entire working career in the
industry apart from military service.
Jeffrey Rose, RAC chairman, says the organisation has been particularly
fortunate in its general secretaries from the time of its first one, Claude
Johnson, in 1897. Limb became general secretary in 1978, and steered the RAC
through its subsequent restructuring.

FT  07 DEC 93 / People: AXA sends Hawken to Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Early in the new year, Jim Hawken will be on his way to Tokyo to set up a
life insurance operation for AXA group. Hawken's new role comes after five
years as sales and marketing manager for AXA Equity &amp; Law and earlier
experience in the 1970s setting up from scratch and then running Equity &amp;
Law's life operation in Germany.
He is spending the next month in a language laboratory learning Japanese;
when he was given the similar task of setting up a new operation in Germany
in the 1970s he had at least, he says, 'school German' to start with.
His current move, he says, is similar in some ways to entering the
highly-regulated German market, but he expects much more rapid expansion in
Japan in the early years than was achieved in the German operation, partly
because it will have the weight of AXA behind it.
AXA sees expansion into the Japanese domestic market as a key element in its
plans to be a significant player in all the major life assurance markets.
Aged 53, Hawken expects to stay with the new company through its start-up
period next year and for the first couple of years after it acquires its
licence and opens for business in early 1995.
At AXA headquarters in Paris, Hawken's background in sales is seen as at
least as important as his German experience, since distribution will be so
critical in the success of the company.
He also has, an official says, 'the right way of working that could be
applied to Japanese staff' in terms of his ability to reach decisions
through consensus.
He is replaced as general manager (sales and marketing) by Mitch Brown who,
together with Duncan Kerr, chief actuary of AXA Equity &amp; Law Life Assurance
Society, join the board of the holding company, AXA Equity &amp; Law.

The BOOTS Company has announced that Terry Richardson, managing director of
international and marketing of Boots Pharmaceuticals, is to take early
retirement. Richardson, 57, was appointed a member of the group board in
1983; he is not being replaced.
Boots Pharmaceuticals has been troubled by the withdrawal in July of
Manoplax, its treatment for congestive heart failure; this led to a Pounds
35m charge and left a large hole in the division's drug portfolio.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, has said the group was conducting a
fundamental reappraisal of its pharmaceuticals business and no options had
been ruled out. The drugs division has been widely seen as too small to be
viable.
Boots Pharmaceuticals had a turnover last year of Pounds 762m and generated
operating profits of Pounds 108m. Non-UK turnover was Pounds 425m, with
operating profits of Pounds 85m.

In a rare example of a company boss falling on his sword, PORTER CHADBURN's
chief executive, Raymond Dinkin, has taken responsibility for recent poor
results and announced he is resigning to make way for someone who might be
able to make a better stab at things.
Pat Barrett, Porter Chadburn's non-executive chairman, said yesterday that
'Ray feels that it is in the best interests of the company that this should
happen. His situation is that of football team managers. When the team gets
relegated, the manager tends to find another team.'
Barrett said that the company's poor results over the past 18 months were
the root cause of Dinkin's going. For the half-year to October 1, operating
losses of Pounds 62,000 were recorded, against operating profits of Pounds
2.2m, pre-exceptional items, last time round. From a 1987 high of more than
300p, Porter Chadburn's shares have fallen to an all-time low of 15p by last
week.
Among the decisions which retrospectively now seem not to have played into
Dinkin's hands was the 1989 acquisition of Gola footwear, the sports shoe
manufacturer. The acquisition did not meet expectations; Gola was sold in
1992.
There is no immediate successor to Dinkin; Barrett says he hopes a new chief
executive will be appointed early in 1994.

<TEXT>
Britain's first public securitisation of a commercial mortgage book, valued
at Pounds 167m, has just been completed by City solicitors Cameron Markby
Hewitt for UCB Bank. The mortgage assets - secure loans from UCB on
residential care homes and nursing homes - will be purchased from the bank
by a newly-formed company, Healthcare Operators Group 1.
Healthcare Operators will finance the acquisition by raising funds against
the security of the assets, with any risk on the assets transferred to the
issuer. Cameron Markby says the financing structure overcomes legal, tax and
regulatory problems which have prevented securitisation of commercial (as
opposed to residential) mortgage assets in the past.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: US firms lead UK on information
technology - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US attorneys are at least two years ahead of large UK law firms in
exploiting information technology, according to US research published in the
UK by the Centre of Law, Computers and Technology at Strathclyde University.
Strathclyde professors Alan Paterson and Richard Susskind say this gap could
mean poorer service to UK corporate clients and less competitive UK law
firms.
The greatest disparities are in the cultural dimension. US lawyers are
comfortable with technology and regard IT as a strategic resource. UK
lawyers remain wary of IT and regard computers as a necessary evil.
The academics say the UK profession must look to the US not just for
examples of what might be achieved but as a study of how competitors are
carrying out their business. The UK profession will fall behind in the
international marketplace unless it embraces technology, they warn.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Numbers can be legally protected -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National rules which allow numbers to be protected as trademarks under
certain speci-fied conditions are lawful under EC law, the European Court of
Justice ruled last week.
The issue arose in the context of a dispute in Germany between carmakers
Audi and Renault. Since 1980, Audi has been selling four-wheel drive cars
under the trademark 'Quattro', which the company had registered under German
law. In 1988, Renault began to sell its own four-wheel drive car, which was
made in France and called the Espace 'Quadra', on the German market.
Audi objected to this and Renault, in reply, submitted written applications
to the German Patent Office seeking the removal of Audi's trademark
protection of 'Quattro'.
Before any decision was taken by the German Patent Office, Audi brought
further proceedings against Renault seeking an injunction against the use of
the term 'Quadra'.
Audi claimed the two words 'Quattro' and 'Quadra' could be confused and
that, under German trademark law, it was entitled to protect the term
'Quattro'.
Audi won both at first instance and on appeal. Renault then appealed to the
German Supreme Court, claiming that if it was prevented from using the term
'Quadra' in Germany, that would constitute an unlawful restraint of
inter-state trade. The German Supreme Court referred the question to the
ECJ.
The court said the absence of Community trademarks legislation when the
dispute arose meant the case had to be examined exclusively in the light of
the Rome treaty rules on the free movement of goods.
There were two points to decide: whether national provisions could give
protection under EC law to the term 'Quattro'; and whether it was lawful to
take into account the risk of confusion between 'Quattro' and 'Quadra'.
The court first reiterated that under free movement of goods rules,
quantitative restrictions on imports between member states and measures of
equivalent effect thereto were unlawful, except insofar as they were
justified by, among other things, the protection of industrial and
commercial property.
However, such restrictions could not constitute a means of arbitrary
discrimination or disguised restriction on trade between member states.
Given that there was no Community trademarks legislation at the time, it was
for national law to determine the conditions of protection for the term
'Quattro'.
On this issue, the court ruled that as the national law in question imposed
very strict conditions on the trademark protection for a term such as
'Quattro' and as there was no evidence that the law could not be used to the
benefit of a non-German producer, the rules in question, which allowed the
registration of a term such as 'Quattro' under the particular conditions in
this case, did not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or
disguised restriction on inter-state trade.
With regard to the confusion between 'Quattro' and 'Quadra', the court first
held that it was the specific aim of trademark law to protect the holder of
a trademark from the risks of confusion.
The court then ruled that the criteria used to determine whether there was a
risk of confusion between the two terms was a matter for national law.
Again, it was necessary to examine whether such national provisions were
compatible with Rome treaty rules on free movement of goods.
The court said there was no evidence that the national laws would breach the
Rome treaty rules, and in particular found no evidence that the German
authorities would apply the rules in a discriminatory manner in favour of
German producers.
It thus ruled that national rules, such as those in question, which granted
a right for the exclusive use of a term such as 'Quattro' in order to stop
the use of a term such as 'Quadra' on the basis that the latter could cause
confusion with the former, were lawful under EC law.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Technology: A shock to the system - The UK's electrical
plugs may lose a pin if plans for a European standard go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not everyone would associate the humdrum world of electrical accessories
with controversy and acrimony but sparks are flying in the debate about the
future of Europe's plugs and sockets - and the UK's big three-pin plugs in
particular.
Axes are being ground ever sharper in a propaganda battle that in recent
weeks has seen claims and counterclaims, 'doom and gloom' forecasts, and
dark allegations about Machiavellian tactics.
Behind it all, however, is a serious 'Euro-issue' that will strike a chord
with anyone who has ever moved domestic appliances across European borders,
or even tried to use an electric shaver or small hair-drier in a different
country.
Today, a working group of Cenelec, the European electrical standard-setting
committee, meets in Brussels for the first time to discuss how a new 'plug
for Europe' system can be implemented.
The plug will have two round pins - a three-pin version will be available
for appliances that need to be earthed - and will be much smaller, lighter
and cheaper than the British plug with its rectangular pins, which was
introduced in 1947.
If the system is approved by Cenelec next summer, it will eventually replace
some 20 European plug and socket systems and end decades of conflicting
standards.
The UK, one of 18 Cenelec member countries, would have to abandon its plug
and socket standard, BS 1363, and adopt the new one. This could relatively
quickly become a world standard for countries operating 220-250 volt
electrical systems - most of the world apart from North America, Japan and
parts of south-east Asia.
But the UK plug and socket manufacturing industry is fighting to kill the
proposal. David Dossett, director of the UK's Electrical Installation
Equipment Manufacturers Association (Eiema), says it could be dangerous for
UK consumers (who in any case have not asked for a change), would seriously
damage the UK industry, which employs 10,000 people, and could cost up to
Pounds 20bn to introduce.
His most vocal opponent, Simon Hossack, a Hertfordshire inventor, rejects
the safety concerns and says a common European plug system could hold big
benefits for UK consumers and industry. 'If the proposal is defeated it
could be 20 to 50 years before another attempt is made to harmonise Europe's
plugs and sockets,' he says.
The issue provokes strong views in the UK electrical industry, with
appliance and electronic equipment manufacturers generally in favour of the
proposal, but the plug and socket manufacturers and some safety experts
against it.
It comes as the UK is about to introduce new safety regulations which would
require appliance manufacturers to fit 13-amp plugs to their products rather
than leaving the consumer to do it. This, says Hossack, could lock the UK
into its current system while every other country in Europe standardises.
The Cenelec proposal is the latest of various schemes involving both
flat-pin and round-pin plugs which have been suggested, voted on, and
rejected, since the International Electrotechnical Commission, the worldwide
standardisation organisation, first discussed the issue in 1966.
It stems from the controversy following a Cenelec document in 1991, Live
with the Differences, which angered supporters of harmonisation and prompted
the European Commission to demand a fresh attempt to introduce a common
system.
The result is a revised version of a proposal first made in 1986 by the IEC
for round-pin plugs, the so-called 906-1 system. The pins have now been
widened from the original 4.5mm to 4.8mm so they can fit into most
Continental systems without being 'dangerously compatible', for example,
with Swiss plugs.
Dossett and the UK plug industry are unhappy with Cenelec's proposals for a
number of reasons:
Dangerous compatibility: Dossett says an existing two-pin plug widely used
in Europe for low-power appliances, the 2.5-amp two-pin 'Europlug', could be
inserted into a 13-amp UK three-pin socket with potentially lethal
consequences. He also claims that the new Cenelec plug could, in some cases,
be dangerously inserted into UK sockets. Some of these have holes wide
enough for the 4.8mm pins, he says.
But opponents say two-pin plugs could not be inserted by accident into UK
sockets and would require deliberate misuse by the consumer. David Latimer,
a consulting engineer who is chairman of IEC and Cenelec wiring committees,
says the danger is more apparent than real.
Other safety and technical issues: Eiema says the Cenelec proposal is for a
16-amp system, and passing 16 amps through a 13-amp plug would cause
dangerously high temperatures, increasing the risk of fire. It also warns
that the British 'ring main' system requires fused plugs, while the Cenelec
proposal is for unfused plugs, as used in the radial wiring networks on the
Continent. This could be potentially very dangerous, it says.
Supporters of harmonisation such as Alan Smith, a technical writer and
electrical expert, counter that the UK system is 'over-fused'. The fuse in
UK plugs is not intended to give personal protection but to protect the
appliance flex, he says, and to accommodate unfused plugs, a flex is fitted
that can be protected by a 20-amp circuit breaker at the fuse box.
Overall, Eiema says, the UK has a 'safe and technically excellent system'
with which electricians and consumers alike are familiar. The Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accidents even suggests that other member states of
the European Union should change to 'our proven, safer' system.
In reply, both Smith and Hossack point to the potential dangers caused by
the arrangement of the terminals under the UK plug cover, inefficient
clamping of the flexible cable in cheaper plugs, and all sorts of injuries
caused when the plug is left loose on the floor - and inevitably ends pins
up.
They also say the UK plug is not user-friendly, especially for arthritics
who have difficulty inserting and removing it from the socket, and say the
whole system has outlived its usefulness because it is not suited to modern
appliance use.
Economic arguments: Supporters of the Cenelec proposal reject the higher
estimates quoted by Eiema, and say costs could be minimal if the system were
phased in on new homes, and adaptors were used on appliances supplied with
the new plug.
Hossack has invented such an adaptor, now licensed to National Power.
But the plug manufacturers do win some sympathy from Latimer on the question
of manufacturing costs. Continental countries already use round pins so the
UK industry faces much heavier costs switching from the milling machines
used for producing rectangular pins to lathes. Dossett claims that adopting
the new plugs could make half the UK industry's Pounds 1.3bn capital
employed redundant.
Answers to many of these questions should come early next year with the
results of a cost-benefit study being conducted by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
When it comes to a vote, later in 1994, the UK could yet win with the
support of Germany, which is pushing an alternative proposal, and Belgium.
Alternatively, the UK could win a derogation, allowing it to continue with
the current system while the rest of Europe comes together. This would leave
the UK 'on the outside looking in', says Latimer, with a far weaker
influence on the electrical standards-setting process.
Dossett wants Cenelec to come up with a better proposal that would address
the UK industry's safety concerns. But some observers believe adoption of
the proposal is inevitable, and suggest that Germany will support it because
of the European Commission's strong wish for harmonisation.
Significantly, Ireland also predominantly uses the UK's 13-amp system, yet
supports the proposal. Dan O'Regan, a senior executive at the National
Standards Authority of Ireland, says he does not see a problem of dangerous
compatibility in Ireland.
'The changeover does not worry our manufacturers. They see a bigger market
than if they continue making the BS 1363 plugs, even though competition will
obviously be tougher,' he adds.

When my family and I bought our dream home in south London earlier this year
we never considered the environmental responsibilities we would be taking
on. We soon had to.
Our problems started when it emerged that the central heating system had all
but packed up. We decided to investigate the financial and environmental
implications of repairing or replacing it, and asked for advice from the
National Energy Foundation. Its aim is to promote energy efficiency and it
runs a National Home Energy Rating Scheme which marks homes out of one to
10. Our house scored only three.
Worse still, heating and lighting the house entailed pumping out 34.2 tonnes
of carbon dioxide a year into the atmosphere.
The annual cost to us of inflicting this environmental catastrophe on an
unsuspecting world was gas and electricity bills of Pounds 1,820 a year.
Something had to be done.
Our assessor, Vic Harrison, suggested nine areas for action, some more
helpful than others. We decided, for example, to dispense with his
suggestion for installing new timber softwood for double glazing.
I am all for improving the environment but I draw the line at a suggestion
that this would cost Pounds 8,200 and take 222.2 years to pay for itself in
saved heating costs.
Among Harrison's more useful suggestions was replacing the house's standard
light bulbs with the low-energy type now available in the high street. He
estimated that an initial outlay of Pounds 75 would save Pounds 22 a year;
we started our energy-efficiency campaign by replacing two of them. The new
bulbs are not pretty and they take a few seconds to warm up but we are
getting used to them.
But the impressive savings would apparently come from replacing our old
boiler with a gas condenser. This works by using a second heat exchanger to
recapture most of the heat normally wasted through the flue.
Harrison reckoned its installation would move our home energy rating up from
three to 4.5 at a stroke. It would take just 5.5 years for us to recoup the
Pounds 2,300 cost of the boiler.
Normally the idea of finding Pounds 2,300 would have stopped us from
proceeding further but, since we needed to fix the heating whatever
happened, we decided to investigate. The problem is that most heating
engineers and plumbers seem to have developed an aversion to gas condenser
boilers, in part because of problems with installing them when they first
came on to the market.
In any case, several engineers assured me that there was no condenser boiler
which was large enough to fit our six-bedroom house. (I should point out
that the house is run-down and does not signify large amounts of wealth of
the type which make finding Pounds 2,300 easy.)
My inquiries eventually led me to the Heating and Ventilating Contractors
Association which advised me that there was at least one make of boiler,
Yorkpark, which would suit my house. But had I considered a smaller
two-boiler system?
Armed with this information I eventually found two engineers willing to give
me quotes, one for the Yorkpark, the other for a system using two Glow worm
boilers.
Their prices? Pounds 7,200 and Pounds 6,400. The main difference between
their quotes and Harrison's original estimate of Pounds 2,300 was that the
current system had been so badly set up that the whole thing needed
renewing, pipes and all.
The quotes also included extending the heating to the top floor of the house
with four new radiators.
After days of anguished deliberation in increasingly cold surroundings, we
eventually plumped for the two-boiler system which worked out at Pounds
6,200 thanks to a Pounds 200 energy-saving grant from the government.
The result is a beautifully warm house and an ever so slightly smug feeling
that we have chosen the environmentally correct route. The rest of the light
bulbs will have to wait.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Tax plan cheers investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke's efforts in last week's UK Budget to attract equity capital
into unquoted companies seems to have struck a chord with the UK's business
angels.
Investors appear to be particularly enthusiastic about the extension of tax
relief to cover capital gains made on the sale of any investment when the
profits are re-invested in unquoted companies.
Some angels say they have paid significant amounts of CGT which might
otherwise have been invested in development capital in other companies.
'At the moment there is little in terms of tax benefits to encourage you to
go out and do the hard work of finding these companies,' says John Milton,
whose family has invested in a number of start-ups.
Colin Sanders, who since selling his Solid State Logic electronics company
to Carlton Communications has invested in about 18 ventures, is equally
enthusiastic.
'The principle of deferring capital gains tax if you are going to invest in
an (unquoted) manufacturing or trading company is an excellent idea,' says
Sanders.
'It seems crazy that people build companies and then stay there getting
bored,' Sanders says.
Even worse for the economy are the entrepreneurs who do sell up but leave
the UK for tax reasons, thereby draining the country not only of sources of
capital but also their expertise.
There are greater misgivings, however, about the Enterprise Investment
Scheme which replaces the Business Expansion Scheme.
Some angels fear that the Treasury may couch the EIS in so many rules and
regulations that it fails to attract investors.
But they are pleased that investors will be able to take an executive role
in companies where they invest.
'I never did anything under BES because I believe that a key ingredient of
success is to be actively involved in the business,' says Mark Fisher, an
angel who has made a number of equity investments for over a decade,
including one with 3i, the UK's largest investment capital group.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Bring on the angels -
Richard Gourlay on how the Budget might help Spotless Lighting to expand
into Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gordon Growmore was already feeling a warm glow from Kenneth Clarke's UK
Budget speech last Tuesday when the telephone rang on his cluttered desk.
'Hi Gordon,' said the excited voice of Bill Watson. 'You must have heard the
chancellor's plans to get investors to put equity into unquoted companies.
It's just the break I said I needed before coming in with you. We must talk
about that expansion into Germany you're always bending my ear about.'
Since taking over from his father as chief executive of Spotless Lighting,
Growmore had taken his Solihull company about as far as the UK market in car
lighting systems would allow. Recession had produced a taut sales force that
responded quickly to customers' wishes. And Spotless had done so much
training that staff seemed to discuss nothing but total quality management
and benchmarking.
Gordon knew this was the way forward, even though sales had remained
stubbornly at about Pounds 15m. But what really fired him was the prospect
of pushing Spotless into Europe, and in particular into Germany, where car
makers had been driven by recession and a strong currency to seek cheaper
foreign suppliers.
The trouble was, a German export drive was going to cost about Pounds
300,000 over two years, a sum the banks would not lend to a company with
sales of only Pounds 15m. Growmore had successfully defused his father's
initial suspicion of outside equity. But, try as he may, even investors who
believed in his German export deal said they could not justify the risk in
such an unfavourable tax environment.
Now the chancellor had opened the door to two immediate sources of capital.
Investors could sell quoted investments and pay no capital gains tax when
they re-invested in companies like Spotless; and the new Enterprise
Investment Scheme allowed any losses to be written off against income or CGT
in the event that Spotless failed in its overseas drive.
But Growmore was even more excited by the prospect of tapping Watson's
knowledge of the German car market. Watson had always said that he, like
other business angels, was as keen to play a non-executive management role
as he was to invest money.
Struggling to contain his excitement, Growmore slipped into the office of
finance director Jenny Beancounter. She was fuming at the Budget. 'Six
months' work getting pay rises paid by the tax payer and one flick of the
chancellor's hush puppies kicks my profit-related pay scheme into touch. And
Gordon, no more gold bullion bonuses this year - he closed that loophole
too.'
Growmore had never understood how Beancounter and the accountants had swung
a PRP scheme in which staff took a salary sacrifice in return for a
guaranteed tax-free profits bonus, thereby leaving the workforce better off
and Spotless with an unchanged wage bill. As for the practice of taking a
bonus in bullion to avoid national insurance contributions, he knew that
could not last.
'Forget about all that,' said Growmore. 'We have some real engineering to
do. Dust off those plans drawn up with Frank Harris at Kidsons Impey in
Birmingham. We're going into Germany.'
Beancounter immediately perked up. Spotless was going to need Pounds
500,000. After the Budget this could be raised from five investors in return
for a quarter of the company. The company would need help drawing up a
prospectus. And there was a need for a shareholder agreement which clearly
established how the angels could exit from their investment. But any
agreement would have to take account of the company's tax situation.
The chancellor had raised the threshold for the 25 per cent small company
corporation tax rate from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000. But Spotlight
was in danger of slipping above this level and paying a marginal rate of 35
per cent. Beancounter had spent long hours with Kidsons Impey discussing how
to bring tax below this 35 per cent rate.
An increased dividend was one way. But Kidsons Impey had recently shown that
Spotlight was better off - and the management no worse off - by giving a
bonus, even after paying employer's national insurance contributions. With
outside investors likely to be wary if management siphoned off large bonuses
 -even if they were tax efficient for the company - Beancounter said there
was a need for the properly drawn-up service contracts that they had
previously eschewed.
As Beancounter ran through this myriad of problems, Growmore wondered why
any investor would want to get involved. Granted there was the 20 per cent
front-end tax break from investing through an EIS in unquoted companies.
And, should Spotlight fail, Watson would be entitled to relief against CGT
or income tax equal to 40 per cent of his net Pounds 80,000 investment.
But what had probably swung him was the innovation that investors could
become paid non-executives without losing their tax breaks. Watson would be
a welcome addition to the board, particularly in the two years it would take
to establish the German operation.
Here again there were tax considerations. Spotlight planned to export
directly but would start with a branch operation. This way, Beancounter
said, Spotlight would get UK tax relief on the start-up costs of the German
branch. The same tax losses could be carried forward for relief against
future branch profits in Germany.
Once the tax losses were fully absorbed by profits at the German branch, a
German limited liability company - Spotlight GmbH - would be formed. That
way Spotlight would benefit twice as it would have had tax relief on the
same losses in both the UK and Germany.
Spotlight would also consider forming a special exporting subsidiary in the
UK to enable it to reclaim VAT on a monthly basis rather than quarterly as
did the main company.
Feeling increasingly smug, Growmore returned to a favourite theme of his.
'Tell me Jenny, what about this new legislation to give a right to interest
on the late payment of debt?' She replied: 'Don't hold your breath pal. The
chancellor said he is only looking at legislation. Anyway, the right to
interest is a red herring, although I grant you we might get General Engine
to pay earlier if legislation makes later payers look like pariahs.
'And one other thing. You do realise our earlier plans for Germany were
based on the new plant we need being eligible for an enhanced first year
capital allowance of 40 per cent. Your so-called champion of small business
has thrown a real spanner in the works by cutting that allowance back to 25
per cent. Where does that leave us?'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Long arm of the ombudsman
 -Small companies are now eligible for assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you do as someone running a small business if your bank transfers
money out of your personal account and into your company's account without
authorisation? Or if the cash takings you deposit in the deposit machine at
your branch go missing through some error?
Apart from considering changing your bank, one answer - if this type of
mistake or misbehaviour occurred after January this year - is to complain to
the banking ombudsman. The two examples come from his annual report,
published last month, and in each case the bank in question made either a
repayment or some compensation.
Sole traders, partners and unincorporated companies have been able to have
their complaints taken up by the banking ombudsman since the scheme started
in 1986. But only since January this year has its scope been extended to
limited companies with an annual turnover of up to Pounds 1m.
To make a complaint to the ombudsman as a small company you follow the same
procedure as if you were a personal customer. In taking up your complaint
with the bank initially, you should write to your branch setting out the
problem and the remedy you seek. If you do not get a satisfactory reply, you
should ask the bank to refer the matter through its procedures, and if you
and it still do not agree, to issue a 'deadlock' letter.
This deadlock is officially the trigger for the banking ombudsman to become
involved, but if you face undue delays from your bank in reaching this
point, an earlier referral of the papers to the ombudsman can speed up
progress. The ombudsman asks a bank to respond within six weeks of a case
having been raised.
Once the ombudsman has decided that he can take up the case, then the
customer will be asked to sign a waiver of confidentiality, and the
ombudsman will write to both parties asking for all relevant information.
The scheme is not necessarily the answer to a small business's prayers in
its dealings with a bank. Its remit is limited, and in most cases last year,
the ombudsman found in favour of the bank rather than the customer.
Laurence Shurman, the lawyer who holds the post of ombudsman at present, has
been at pains in the annual report to spell out the limits of his powers.
'If a bank is in breach of its contract or if there is evidence of
maladministration or of some other breach of duty from which loss, damage or
inconvenience results, then the ombudsman may be able to intervene and award
compensation,' he said.
'What I cannot do in the absence of maladministration or some other breach
of duty is to interfere with a bank's commercial decision, whether it be on
lending or otherwise.'
He added that if a bank refused to make a loan or decided to demand
repayment on reasonable notice of an overdraft then provided it had
fulfilled its duty, these were decisions in which 'neither a court nor the
ombudsman can interfere'.
The extension of the scheme to small businesses has prompted the ombudsman
to begin separating out business from personal customer complaints, so next
year's report should be more informative about how far businesses are using
the scheme and how helpful they are finding it.
This year's report said that of the almost 5,000 new complaints made between
April and September this year, business accounts represented 15 per cent.
The National Federation of Small Businesses campaigned for the extension of
the ombudsman scheme to small companies and is pleased that this has
happened. But Bernard Juby, chairman of the federation's trade and industry
committee, is doubtful that it will lead to a great deluge in cases, since
only a small proportion of small businesses are incorporated companies.
He added, however, that many people did not realise the scheme already
extended to unincorporated businesses, and so the greater publicity from the
extension of the ombudsman's role might encourage small businesses which
were already covered to come forward with complaints.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Fixed phones ride the airwaves: Andrew Adonis on technology
that could provide cheap networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An idea as revolutionary as the mobile phone was a decade ago could provide
telecommunications networks which replace miles of costly copper wire with
radio waves.
The technology is being developed in the UK for launch in early 1995 by
Ionica, based in Cambridge.
Mr Nigel Playford, Ionica's founder and managing director, says the wireless
system, which will link exchanges with fixed phones in homes and businesses
using signals from a network of base stations, will slash the cost of
building and operating local phone networks. This will boost competition in
a sector which has been a virtual BT monopoly.
Ionica secured a UK licence in February, but has spent nearly three years on
research and development. 'Markets create services,' says Mr Playford, an
electronics engineer turned entrepreneur.
The market was created by the government's abolition of the BT/Mercury
duopoly in 1991, and Mr Playford and two others launched the company that
year. It now has about 150 employees, including designers from Northern
Telecom, the project's main contractor.
The Ionica service for the UK will be geared to the existing market of more
than 20m fixed phone subscribers. A receiving antenna, like a television
aerial, will be attached to the roof of each subscribing home or business.
Ionica is confident it can provide a service without the fluctuations in
signal quality experienced with mobile receivers.
'With copper-wire networks, capital investment has to be up front. With us,
most of it follows the customer,' Mr Playford said. Only the base stations -
each of which would cost about Pounds 10,000 and could serve about 1,000
customers - are 'up front'.
The rest of the investment - the antenna and internal wiring - is made only
after the customer has signed up. While cable TV companies spend about
Pounds 5bn building networks in conurbations, Ionica plans to cover half the
country for about Pounds 100m by 1997.
The company plans to offer a national service, aiming for a foothold in the
small-business and residential market. It intends to guarantee sizeable
savings on BT prices and will offer features such as three-way calling,
voice messaging, and extra lines at low cost - each antenna link will be
able to carry up to eight lines.
For larger businesses, the fact that radio waves cannot cope with heavy data
transfer will reduce Ionica's appeal.
By creating an alternative 'local loop', Ionica is targeting the least
competitive part of BT's market. Even when the cable companies have
completed their networks, they will cover less than half of the UK.
Ionica's radio waves will connect to BT's principal exchanges via parallel
Ionica exchanges. It will send the trunk portion of calls over the BT
network, or that of one of its long-distance competitors.
In doing so, it is able to exploit the most competitive part of the UK
telecoms market, the long distance networks.
With at least three nationwide long-distance operators in the market by 1995
 -BT, Mercury and Energis, a subsidiary of National Grid - and BT making
hefty margins on its trunk business, Ionica expects to be offered attractive
deals.
Backers include Northern Electric, Yorkshire Electricity and Telecom
Finland. About Pounds 30m of the Pounds 100m needed has already been raised.
But launching the service will be far from simple. Capital has to be raised
to fund an unfamiliar venture. Base station sites have to be found.
Does the technology work? There is some scepticism in the telecommunications
world. Trials in East Anglia next year will show whether Ionica's radio
quality is up to that offered by copper and fibre. It also has to ensure
uninterrupted service quality in hilly areas.
Meanwhile, imitation is flattery: Mercury, the main UK competitor to BT,
recently announced its intention to test wireless technology, with a view to
possible introduction not long after Ionica. Millicom, a US company, is also
planning a radio-based service.
The system has strong attractions for developing countries with inadequate
fixed networks. The Mexican government recently received an application to
build a second national telecommunications network using the technology
developed by Ionica.
The request for a Mexican licence by Pulsar, the Mexican conglomerate
founded by multi-billionaire Mr Alfonso Romo Garza, could be a milestone.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Backing for review of child support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial Child Support Agency came under renewed fire from MPs
yesterday, following publication of a Commons social security committee
report broadly endorsing the agency's role in collecting maintenance
payments from absent parents.
At question time in the Commons Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,

FT  07 DEC 93 / Electronics sector warned of 27,000 job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish electronics industry, which employs 45,000 people, has been
warned that employment could fall 40 per cent to only 27,000 by 1997.
In a report by Monitor, the US consultants, the industry is described as
structurally weak, poorly integrated and 'misaligned'.
Senior members of the industry yesterday launched the Scottish Electronics
Forum, aimed at tackling its serious weaknesses and uniting for the first
time indigenous Scottish electronics companies and the multinational
companies which have plants in Scotland.
It has agreed what it calls a 'road map' for addressing immediate problems
and building a more robust, sustainable industry.
The Scottish electronics industry is often seen as a success story. It
accounts for 40 per cent of Scotland's exports and about 35 per cent of all
personal computers and workstations made in Europe come from Scotland.
IBM's personal computer plant is at Greenock. Other multinationals include
Motorola (with two plants), Compaq, NCR, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems,
Digital (two plants), NEC and OKI.
Yet as Mr John Ward, IBM's resident director in Scotland and chairman of the
forum, pointed out yesterday, the industry leans heavily to production,
which accounts for 70 per cent of output. Only 6 per cent of employees are
in research and development - mostly in the relatively closed defence sector
 -and 3 per cent in marketing.
Most Scottish plants are purely manufacturing operations, making products
designed and marketed elsewhere. The exceptions include NCR, which runs its
worldwide automated teller machine operations from Dundee, and
Hewlett-Packard, which has a telecoms operation at South Queensferry, near
Edinburgh.
Indigenous companies play a tiny role in the industry. Mimtec, which has
built its second plant close to IBM, and Fullarton Computer Industries, part
of Laird Group, are among the very few sizeable Scottish components
suppliers.
Only 12 per cent of components used by the industry in Scotland are made
there, while Scottish-based companies account for only 11.5 per cent of
Scotland's Pounds 5bn a year output of electronics products.
The Monitor report, commissioned by Scottish Enterprise, the development
body, says the industry is misaligned partly because of its dependence on
manufacturing when the global trend is to software production, while
miniaturisation and greater on-chip integration threaten traditional
assembly.
The manufacturing base will face increased competition as companies trim
capacity and look to lower-cost countries as a source of supply. Indigenous
companies are far too few and weak to fill the gaps that would be left by
any departing multinationals, the report says.
Growth in Scotland's electronics industry has tailed off. After compound
growth in the 1980s of 16 per cent a year, output has been flat since 1989
and the numbers employed have fallen by 1 per cent since then.
The forum has 30 members, including the main multinationals and about 15
from indigenous companies, although neither Mimtec nor Fullarton is among
them.
It will operate through several sub-groups, each focusing on a different
issue, and will seek to improve the industry's competitiveness and support
indigenous companies, trying to persuade multinationals to try to source
more components locally, and encouraging local companies to try to meet
their demands.
But the problems it is tackling have largely defied solution in the past
decade.
As one Scottish manufacturer said yesterday: 'The weak entrepreneurial
culture here is a problem that is not going to disappear overnight.'

The cost of tracking down and eliminating a single computer virus is about
Pounds 50,000 for a typical company, the National Computing Centre said.
The centre today launches a Pounds 60,000 survey in conjunction with the
Department of Trade and Industry and the computer company ICL to reassess
the cost of security breaches and identify the causes of incidents.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Vauxhall strike threat recedes
</HEADLINE>

The threat of strike action at Vauxhall receded yesterday when members of
the AEEU engineering union voted not to take action against the company's
offer of an increase of 2.5 per cent this year and 3 per cent plus a lump
sum of 1 per cent next year.
AEEU members at Luton and Ellesmere Port voted by 2,318 to 374 against
strike action and implicitly accepted the deal.
TGWU members at Luton also rejected action. TGWU members at Ellesmere Port
voted narrowly to reject the deal but will not take action on their own.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Brent to slash council tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative-controlled north London borough of Brent has said that it
will cut its council tax next year, in spite of a likely average nationwide
increase of 7 per cent. Band D households will pay Pounds 497, exactly
Pounds 100 less than last year's bill.
The council said it had been able to make the reduction because the cut in
its estimated standard spending had been less than expected, while generous
'buffering' grants had limited the total fall in grant to 2 per cent.
The administration, in a borough which is regarded as marginal for next
year's council elections, attributed the generous settlement to successful
lobbying.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Industrial gas price forecast to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of gas supplied to some of the largest industrial users could rise
as a result of introducing greater competition into the domestic market,
according to a survey published yesterday, Robert Corzine writes.
The survey, which compared international gas prices, was conducted by
National Utility Services, a company which advises businesses on ways to
control utility costs.
It noted that British Gas's monopoly over the residential market had allowed
it to offer very low prices to industrial users willing to have their
supplies interrupted during periods of peak demand. But the company said the
removal of the monopoly, as recommended recently by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, could lead to price rises for large users in the short
term.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Budget worries slow consumer credit rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer borrowing slackened ahead of the Budget due to concerns about large
tax increases, government figures suggested yesterday.
Net lending to consumers by finance houses and building societies and on
credit cards in the Visa and Mastercard systems came to Pounds 311m in
October, compared with Pounds 489m in September.
The figures provide a warning that the recent strong growth in consumer
activity could run out of steam should people start to worry about the
effects on disposable income of the Pounds 8.1bn tax increases coming into
force in April.
Before last week's Budget many people were concerned that the government
might impose still greater tax increases than the Pounds 1.4bn announced in
addition to the Pounds 6.7bn of tax increases already in the pipeline for
April.
Between August and October lending was Pounds 1.025bn, up from Pounds 535m
in the previous three months and the highest three-month figure for nearly
three years.
The Treasury said that, even allowing for the sharp fall between September
and October in the seasonally adjusted lending figure, the October total was
the second highest since April 1991.
Although the Central Statistical Office lending figures do not include
mortgages, the figures are considered a reliable guide to consumer
behaviour.
Net lending by finance houses increased slightly from Pounds 336m in
September to Pounds 349m the following month, with much of this cash going
on durable goods such as cars, carpets and cookers. A net Pounds 31m was
repaid on credit card loans in October, however, indicating a move away from
using cards to finance new spending. The repayment followed a net increase
in card loans of Pounds 106m in September.
October also saw a net repayment on loans taken out through building
societies. Consumers paid back Pounds 7m in October, after boosting
borrowing by Pounds 47m in the previous month.
The amount of new credit to consumers - which does not take repayments into
account - came to Pounds 4.39bn in October, down from a record Pounds
4.848bn in September.

Bifu, the banking and finance union, has condemned the multi-million pound
bonuses being given to City 'high-flyers' at a time when most staff are

Richard Lynch, Bifu's senior London organiser, said: 'The City high-flyers
getting those huge bonuses are the people who tell the rest of us we must

April.
Between August and October lending reached Pounds 1.025bn, up from Pounds
535m in the previous three months and the highest three-month figure for
nearly three years.
A feature of the three months to October is the degree to which consumers
increased borrowing from finance houses. The net lending taken on in this
period from this source came to Pounds 983m, up from Pounds 519m between May
and July.
This underlines people's keenness - aided by lower interest rates - to spend
more money in recent months, which has helped to underpin the economic
recovery of the past year.
The Treasury said that, even allowing for the sharp fall between September
and October in the seasonally adjusted lending figure, the October total was
the second highest since April 1991, showing a 'continued upswing' in
consumer activity.
Although the Central Statistical Office lending figures do not include
mortgages, the figures are considered a reliable guide to consumer
behaviour.
Net lending by finance houses increased slightly from Pounds 336m in
September to Pounds 349m the following month, with much of this cash going

FT  07 DEC 93 / Backing for review of child support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial Child Support Agency came under renewed fire from MPs
yesterday, following publication of a Commons social security committee
report broadly endorsing the agency's role in collecting maintenance
payments from absent parents.
At question time in the Commons Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
welcomed the report and promised to examine recommendations aimed at easing
the burden of payments on absentee fathers.
Tory backbenchers joined opposition MPs in protesting that the agency was
not concentrating on tracing absent parents who failed to pay maintenance
for their children.
The committee's report called for changes in the formula for calculating
maintenance payments to reduce the burden on absent fathers. It recommended
that big increases in maintenance be phased in over up to two years.
It endorsed the principles behind the agency, however, in spite of
widespread concern about the way maintenance is calculated.
Mr Lilley said reaction to the agency came from 'men who were reluctant to
pay in full the costs of maintaining their children'.
He added: 'It is inevitable there should be some resistance to paying in
full the costs of maintaining children if people have not been doing so up
to now.'
Mr Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford, said Tory backbenchers were
'delighted' that the workings of the agency were to be reviewed. 'There are
a number of very serious problems which I have come across in my
constituency.'
Mr Adam Ingram, Labour MP for East Kilbride, said there was 'very real
anger' at the way government policy had been enforced.
Mr Lilley replied that in 96 per cent of cases dealt with by the agency the
mothers and children had been on benefit while the fathers usually had a
reasonable income.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons committee, said it was
'imperative' that the government accepted in full the report's
recommendations. 'Failure to do so, or to cherry pick over the
recommendations, will lead to a breaking up of political support for this
reform.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Leukaemia victim awarded Pounds 167,154
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former dockyard fitter who contracted leukaemia through working on nuclear
submarines was yesterday awarded Pounds 167,154 damages against the Ministry
of Defence.
Mr Rudy Molinari, 39, a father of two who worked at the Royal Naval
Dockyards, Chatham, Kent, between 1970 and 1983, was told by the judge that
if his period of remission ended and the disease reappeared within five
years he or his family could return to court for further damages.
It was the first time that damages have been assessed for leukaemia, and the
judgment could have implications for about 120 other workers who are
considering claims for radiation exposure against the ministry.
The ministry denied negligence but admitted liability in that it 'failed to
do all that was reasonably practicable to restrict the extent to which Mr
Molinari was exposed to ionising radiations'.
The award includes Pounds 40,000 for pain and suffering. The majority of the
balance was for loss of earnings.
The MoD, which had paid Pounds 160,000 into court, was ordered to pay the
costs.
Mr Martyn Day, solicitor for Mr Molinari, said after the hearing he was
delighted with the judgment. There were 'hundreds, if not thousands, of
radiation victims throughout industry awaiting the outcome of the case,' he
said.
Mr Molinari said he hoped that a proposed 'no-fault' compensation scheme,
which involved no legal accusations, would soon be in place.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Ford, Vauxhall see strong performance in November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford and Vauxhall, leaders of the UK market for new cars, both performed
strongly last month in an overall market that rose by 19.4 per cent
year-on-year, Kevin Done writes.
Ford had suffered an erosion of its sales earlier in the year, however, and
its share in the first 11 months has slipped to 21.7 per cent from 22.5 per
cent a year ago.
The biggest gains among the leading manufacturers have been achieved by Fiat
of Italy, Renault and Citroen of France, and Nissan and Toyota of Japan.
Fiat, which has struggled for several years in the UK, has increased its
sales by 38 per cent this year following heavy investment to improve its
dealer network.
Germany's Volkswagen, the leading European manufacturer, has been one of the
main losers this year, with sales falling by 1.6 per cent in the first 11
months.

FT  07 DEC 93 / NHS beds help win gobbledegook prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When is a bed not a bed? The National Health Service's answer won it a
gobbledegook prize in the annual Plain English Campaign's awards yesterday.
In a circular from the NHS's value-for-money unit a bed is described as 'a
device or arrangement that may be used to permit a patient to lie down'.
Beds that fail the test are those which are used for 'active intervention
such as examination, diagnostic investigation, manipulative treatment,
obstetric delivery or transport'.
The Plain English Campaign, which collects nominations for its prizes
throughout the year from members of the public, aims to 'stamp out small
print, jargon and other nonsense from public information'.
Other gobbledegook winners included a document from the trade union Unison,
which takes 18 lines of memo to get round to saying that it recommends not
making a recommendation.
Winners of awards for clear, straightforward communication included the
Inland Revenue for a leaflet aimed at encouraging people on low incomes to
claim tax back on their savings. The Financial Times won the 'best national
newspaper' category.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Open-ended investment companies a step closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The introduction of the open-ended investment company (OEIC) came a step
closer yesterday as the Treasury published a consultation paper on how the
investment vehicle could be structured.
The paper, produced after consultation with the investment industry, says
that the new vehicle is needed alongside the unit trust to let UK fund
managers compete more effectively in the international market.
OEICs are common in other European countries and in north America, where
investors and their financial advisers are unfamiliar with unit trusts.
The regulation regime for OEICs will be set by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, which regulates unit trusts.
In October the board issued a discussion paper putting forward ways of
deregulating the Pounds 84bn unit trust industry, although this did not
resolve the deep divisions about the future method of pricing.
OEIC investments would be bought and sold at a single price, in contrast to
the arrangements for unit trusts, where potential investors see both an
'offer' price, at which they can buy units, and a lower 'bid' price at which
they can sell.
The paper says that the costs to fund managers of setting up and running
OEICs should not be more than it is for unit trusts, and emphasises that,
whatever the pricing of OEICs, there must be clear regulations on disclosure
of charges.
To meet the industry's demand for early action the government plans to allow
OEICs under secondary legislation, which could be processed early in 1995.
Subject to the progress of the consultation, the tax treatment of OEICs
would be covered in the 1995 finance bill.
Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, said the proposals would
offer investors a good standard of protection while enabling UK fund
managers to compete effectively in the European single market.
Written responses to the Treasury paper are required by March 18.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Budget debate rules attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cross-party committee of MPs yesterday accused the government of stifling
debate on the first unified Budget, delivered last week by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor.
In a sharply critical report, the procedure committee says the government
has rejected proposals for radical changes in the parliamentary arrangements
for the Budget.
The committee, chaired by Sir Peter Emery, Conservative MP for Honiton, says
that the government has 'failed in the objective it set itself of enabling
'a more informed and focused debate'.'
The report shows that the government rejected a series of proposals by the
committee. They included:
Splitting the finance bill to allow detailed tax changes to be presented in
a separate taxes management bill.
Setting up a standing committee of MPs to consider the details of technical
changes in taxation regulations.
Delaying the start of the Budget debate for two days to allow MPs to digest
the contents of the chancellor's speech.
Allowing minority parties and individual MPs to table amendments to the
chancellor's spending and taxation plans, in addition to the traditional
opposition amendment.
In its response to the committee the government said that its proposals
amounted to 'a radical change' in procedures which would create 'confusion'.
The committee, which has a Conservative majority, says an amendment to the
ruleswould allow MPs to express an opinion on the Budget strategy without
affecting the passage of the finance bill.
The committee says: 'The range of economic policy options available at any
one time must justify a vote on more than just one amendment. To refuse this
is stifling the expression of views of the minority parties or of the
strength of feeling of a minority within the government party.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Nadir threatens to sue British authorities for Pounds 4.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, yesterday stepped up his war of
words by threatening to sue the British authorities for Pounds 4.5bn he
claimed had been lost as a result of the collapse of his former company,
Polly Peck International.
Speaking from the local headquarters of PPI in northern Cyprus, Mr Nadir
also claimed that the UK authorities, using unnamed intermediaries, had
offered to drop the case against him 'under certain circumstances'.
Mr Nadir's remarks, reported by the Turkish government news agency, were
dismissed by the British government. The Home Office said last night: 'If Mr
Nadir has any concerns, he should take them up with the Police Complaints
Authority.'
Mr Nadir travelled to Cyprus in May after illegally jumping bail conditions
in the UK where he faces charges of theft and false accounting for Pounds
34m. His latest tirade appears aimed at winning public support in Turkey,
where he is mounting a last-ditch legal battle to prevent administrators at
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand from disposing of the remaining PPI companies
in Turkey and northern Cyprus.
The administrators are trying to tie up the sale of Meyna, the Turkish fruit
business which contributed most of PPI's reported profits in the near and
Middle East. An Izmir-based soft drinks company confirmed last week it was
negotiating to buy the PPI fruit and packaging concern.
It emerged yesterday that the Turkish courts are planning to delay a
hearing, originally set for January, over the administrators' claims to AN
Graphics, a disputed Istanbul printing company, apparently after an
intervention by Mr Nadir's lawyers.
Yesterday he repeated his threats to travel to Turkey to pursue his business
interests, and revealed plans for new investments in the fruit business and
electronics in northern Cyprus.
Elections are being held in northern Cyprus next week. Opposition parties
have complained in earlier elections that Mr Nadir has used money from the
local PPI companies to support the ruling party.
As administrators prepare to report to the PPI creditors, Mr Nadir has
thrown up a barrage of legal obstacles in an apparent bid to put the
administrators off his scent, and delay the sale of the remaining PPI
assets.
His lawyers recently released an internal memo prepared by the
administrators Coopers &amp; Lybrand, in which the word 'bribe' is used in
connection with equipment held by customs in Istanbul.
Earlier this month, Mr Michael Jordan, one of the joint administrators, was
woken in his hotel room by Turkish authorities and ordered to appear before
the Istanbul public prosecutor the following morning.
A detention order was issued by the public prosecutor for all three
administrators and five other officials on request from Mr Nadir's lawyer.
It was subsequently cancelled.
In the often frustrating three-year task to recover PPI assets, the
administrators say they have gone out of their way to win the co-operation
of the local management.
Mr Nadir's actions highlight the problems of working in a legal system which
is not always transparent. 'It has been a big handicap not being an insider.
Nadir has shown he still has good connections,' said one Coopers official.
More than that, flattering coverage in the local Turkish press has not made
the administrators' job any easier.
Others involved in sorting out PPI assets, including the trustees in
bankruptcy and the administrators have found themselves at odds over what
constitutes a PPI asset and what belongs to Mr Nadir, who was only a company
official appointed by PPI's shareholders.
In northern Cyprus, a series of court injunctions remain blocking the
administrators' access to Sunzest, the fruit packaging company, Unipac the
packaging company in Famagusta, and two hotels.
Mr Jordan's brief altercation with the Istanbul prosecutor forced him to
cancel a trip to Cyprus to attend one of the court hearings.
'Around the rest of the world, he hasn't caused the administrators any
trouble at all. There, the only problems were technical like the state of
banana prices,' says Mr Roger White of Coopers &amp; Lybrand - referring to the
sale of Del Monte Fruit, the largest of the disposals achieved by the
administrators.
In Turkey and especially in northern Cyprus, the administrators have been
put through the hoops - they have been thrown off the premises of some of
the disputed companies, and physically prevented from attending board
meetings.
The administrators' local lawyers have also been threatened - one occasion
involving a voodoo-style incident involving a headless chicken.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Names likely to reject Lloyd's offer on losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London will today publish details of an offer to settle legal
actions at the insurance market, amid increasing signs that the offer will
prove unacceptable to leaders of loss-making Names.
Lloyd's is poised to offer Names - the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the market - about Pounds 900m as settlement of
claims of about Pounds 3.5bn.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working
Party, which represents 17,000 Names organised in 37 action groups, said:
'There is little chance of Names accepting this. There is always a
possibility that they will pull a rabbit out of the hat. But we expect to be
giving strong advice to Names to refuse the deal.'
The deal will offer 21,000 Names compensation reflecting a range of factors
including the likelihood of success in the courts, the proximity of hearings
and the number of loss-making syndicates to which loss-makers belong.
Names on the Feltrim and Gooda Walker syndicates, who are claiming more than
Pounds 1bn in damages, are expected to be offered about Pounds 500m of the
compensation.
But Names who were members of syndicates specialising in liability business,
which have been hit hard by claims from US asbestosis and pollution, are
expected to receive much less compensation.
A number of the Names' leaders are worried that the settlement makes little
or no provision for claims which have still to emerge on many affected
syndicates and that no provisions have been made to cap losses for
individual Names.
Observers have been quick to criticise the apparent failure to offer Names
on the liability syndicates better compensation.
Mr Robert Saunders, a Lloyd's specialist with Smith &amp; Williamson, the
private bank, said: 'Their losses are just as bad. Its just death by a
thousand cuts rather than a bullet in the head. It is easy to buy off the
high profile people and cut the rest off.'
Lloyd's aims to finance the deal from three main sources: contributions of
Pounds 400m from errors and omissions insurers, which provide insurance for
agents covering legal awards for negligence; a contribution of up to Pounds
400m from its own central fund; and donations of about Pounds 50m from
members' agents.
Lloyd's is also expected to set up a new company, called Lloyd's Recoveries,
which would take legal action for alleged negligence against accountants,
from whom some Names are also seeking damages.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Jump in loyalist paramilitary recruitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recruitment to loyalist paramilitary groups has accelerated amid revelations
about communication between the British government and Sinn Fein, and
loyalist suspicion of the London-Dublin peace initiative, security sources
believe.
One assessment by the security forces puts the armed active strength of the
Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters at about 200  -
compared with 500 to 600 IRA 'volunteers'.
The UVF and UFF are thought to be recruiting young, mostly unemployed
Protestants, and attempting to raise funds from businesses.
Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast Ulster Unionist party councillor who has strong
contacts with the loyalist community, described official estimates of
loyalist military strength as 'rubbish' and said he had information
suggesting that the strength of support for the UVF and UFF was running into
thousands.
He said: 'The rate of recruitment at the moment is staggering. People are
coming to realise that the only language the British government understands
is violence and that violence is going to have to be used to prevent the
majority being pushed into a united Ireland against their wishes.'
Unionist politicians have frequently exaggerated the threat of a loyalist
backlash. But fears about a backlash are increasing in the army. One
security source expressed concern that loyalists trained in the army might
take their expertise to the paramilitaries.
Of the 79 terrorist killings in Northern Ireland this year 33 are accounted
for by the IRA and 46 by loyalists.
The UVF and UFF have concentrated on killings planned at short notice. They
have so far failed to obtain Semtex or commercial explosives to carry out a
large operation.
Thousands of Protestants would be forced to leave Ulster within a decade of
unity between north and south, Mr John Taylor, UUP MP for Strangford, said
last night.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Channel tunnel evacuation procedures to be tested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large-scale evacuation involving 1,000 Channel tunnel employees, their
spouses and children is to be carried out just before the tunnel opens for
business next March.
Mr Edward Ryder, UK head of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, said
yesterday the plan was to test whether Channel tunnel trains could be
evacuated rapidly in the case of a fire. The test will simulate the
evacuation of a fully loaded train either through the central service tunnel
or by train on the other main rail track.
Car shuttles on the cross-Channel trains, once evacuated, are designed to
contain a fire for 30 minutes, long enough for the train to reach the end of
the tunnel, Mr Ryder said at the presentation of the authority's annual
report.
The main gas to be used to extinguish fires, halon 1301, is to be phased out
from 1995 under an international agreement on greenhouse gases and a
substitute will have to be found. Mr Ryder said Eurotunnel had enough stocks
to last 10 years.
Mr Ryder did not rule out the possibility that tests of more complex parts
of tunnel equipment might lead to the opening being further delayed. But he
added: 'We are confident that the design and concept of the project ought to
be able to work safely. Once you are inside, you will be safer than you were
on the journey to the tunnel.'
Tests of the tunnel and its equipment will continue until the opening. Tests
on the effectiveness of the ventilation system cannot be completed until
trains are running.
The risk of an earthquake damaging the tunnel has been assessed and it has
been shown capable of withstanding shock waves equal to those of the worst
earthquake to hit southern England, in 1580.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Guidelines issued on hotel valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hotels should be more consistently valued under professional guidelines
issued yesterday by the British Association of Hotel Accountants.
The guidelines come shortly after revelations that valuations by two firms
earlier this year on the 1992 assets of Queens Moat House had diverged by
nearly Pounds 500m.
They are the result of two years' work by the technical committee of the
association, which will form part of best practice but is unlikely to be
given any mandatory status.
Under the new guidance property valuation should relate to recent and
current performance - and particularly future trading potential, based on
cash flow projection.
Valuers should normally use a discounted cash flow technique to simulate
anticipated receipts, payments and operating performance of a hotel, which
is then capitalised.
Information on sale prices of other hotels should only be used as a
benchmark.
Separately, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Accounting
Standards Board are considering new valuation guidelines.
The guidelines say hotels should normally be given an open market value for
their existing use. The guidelines express concern at the volatility of
hotel valuations, which have sometimes not been supported by the earnings
achieved.

Hotel Accountants, 193 Trinity Rd, London SW17 7HN. Pounds 25

FT  07 DEC 93 / Shake-up on road costings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government may in future award road-building contracts to companies
which guarantee to keep down future maintenance costs rather than to those
which submit the lowest bid.
The Department of Transport yesterday announced the first contract to be
awarded under a new 'whole-life costing scheme' which takes expected
maintenance costs and traffic delays into account.
A Pounds 34m contract for the construction of the 3 1/2 -mile Brockworth
bypass near Gloucester went to Wimpey Construction.
The department has spent the past two years devising a computer model to
assess the total costs of different road surfaces. Contractors are given the
figures for future costs to help them frame bids.
Wimpey said it had submitted three bids for the Brockworth contract
involving different road surfaces. This was normal practice, it said.
Tarmac roads need strengthening halfway through their 40-year lives while
concrete roads do not, but this does not mean concrete will automatically be
cheaper.
Whole-life costing did not make a great deal of difference to the Brockworth
bypass contract because Wimpey was the lowest bidder anyway, the Department
of Transport said.
Mr Robert Key, roads minister, said: 'The aim of whole life costing is to
tell us if it is worth providing roads that give longer life and need less
maintenance.'

FT  07 DEC 93 / Orchestra inquiry acts over criticisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arts Council plans to publish the controversial Hoffman report on London
orchestras to allay criticisms of proposed funding changes.
The changes would increase the Philharmonia's subsidy at the expense of the
London Philharmonic and the Royal Philharmonic.
The council's members, led by Lord Palumbo, the chairman, are expected to
decide soon whether to implement the recommendation that the Philharmonia
should receive a subsidy of about Pounds 1.2m, compared with Pounds 700,000
last year, while subsidies of the RPO and LPO are halved.
The proposal has been made by the council's advisory panel on music, chaired
by Mr Bryan Magee, the writer and former MP, following a meeting on Friday.
The recommendation, based on a report by a special committee chaired by the
judge, Sir Leonard Hoffmann, has attracted criticism because it puts the
future of the RPO and the LPO in doubt.
If the changes go ahead the RPO may move its base from London to Nottingham.
A council member said there have been discussions between the Arts Council
and Nottingham City Council on the relocation of the RPO.
He said Nottingham was enthusiastic about providing a new home for the RPO,
and added: 'They talked about building a new concert hall.'
The Hoffman committee's report was being sent to council members yesterday.
It says that the Philharmonia is better than the RPO and LPO by a wide
margin on all criteria except marketing expertise and educational functions.
Another council member said: 'On artistic and management grounds it is
clearly ahead of the others.'
Mr Magee and Lord Palumbo are convinced that London has too many orchestras
and that council resources should be concentrated on just one of the three
plus the London Symphony Orchestra, which is resident at the Barbican. The
orchestras had originally feared that the losers from the Hoffmann review
would receive no subsidy at all.
Many council members believe that its reputation as a policy maker will be
severely damaged if it fails to implement the Hoffmann recommendation. One
council member said: 'If we back down on this one the council's cred-ibility
will be shot to pieces.'
Some council members are concerned that the recommendation will put the
council in conflict with London's South Bank arts complex, which has given a
long-term residency to the LPO. A council member said: 'There must be a
danger that the South Bank would refuse to book the Philharmonia.'
A Pounds 4m scenery store for the Royal Opera House is to be built near
Aberdare in the Cynon Valley, south Wales.
The store will receive an urban investment grant of more than Pounds 1m and
will house all the opera house's scenery and props, which are now kept in
several buildings near London.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Groundwork for devolved government nears completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is on the verge of completing its groundwork on possible
structures for devolved government in Northern Ireland, David Owen writes.
This brings the resumption of all-party talks between the province's
constitutional parties a step nearer.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, is understood to be close
to completing the delicate task of identifying an outline that could form
the basis for an eventual settlement.
Resumed talks are expected to focus on the creation of an 85-seat
legislative assembly - the model for which was drawn up in talks last year.
Under a blueprint agreed by a working group including all four
constitutional parties, an assembly with some legislative powers would be
elected by proportional representation.
In a separate move the government yesterday announced plans to prune the
29,000-strong Northern Ireland civil service with the help of a voluntary
redundancy scheme.
Ministers expect that civil servant numbers will have to fall by between 600
and 700 by March 1995, representing a 3 per cent cut in non-industrial
staff.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Smithfield traders step up protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traders at London's Smithfield meat market took their protest over the rents
they are being charged to the ballot box and the High Court yesterday.
They are in dispute with their landlord, the Corporation of London, which is
carrying out a Pounds 60m refurbishment of the market. Traders have appealed
against the rents, and have run as candidates to sit on the City's general
council.
In council elections held yesterday, 12 of the City's 25 wards were
contested, a far higher number than usual. Smithfield candidates were
standing in 10 wards, and were guaranteed to provide at least two council
members. Final results of the elections should be known today.
Traders also began their High Court application for judicial review of rents
yesterday. They said the market would cease to exist if they were not
offered better terms.
Mr Andrew Collins QC, appearing for Mr John Brewster, chairman of Smithfield
Market Tenants' Association, said the corporation's proposals would 'render
it impossible for any tenants to be found to operate in the market, so the
market will cease to exist'.
The corporation, he argued, had long ago conceded that it was under a duty
created by the 1860 Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act to provide a
market, and it would require new legislation to close the market down.
In March the corporation made a 'final offer' to Smithfield tenants on rent,
rates, and the nature and size of accommodation. The tenants' association
said the offer was unacceptable on both finance and space grounds.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Education bill faces rebellion by Tory peers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition peers expect the government to have difficulty getting its new
education bill through parliament in its current form because of a growing
rebellion by Tory peers.
The bill, which would reform the organisation of teacher training and end
compulsory membership of student unions, will be debated by parliament for
the first time today, when it receives its second reading in the upper
chamber.
An ominous sign for the government yesterday was that more than 30 peers had
applied to speak in the second reading debate, about three times the usual
number for such an event.
Baroness David, who speaks for the opposition on education, said that she
expected most of the speeches to be against the bill, and that there would
be a lot of pressure to amend it during and after its committee stage next
year.
Several Tory peers have already said that they will be speaking against the
legislation while a Labour whip yesterday promised that the bill's passage
through the chamber would turn into a 'marathon' for the government.
Department for Education officials are also admitting privately that the
legislation on student unions will be one of the most hotly contested
legislative issues in the new session. Vice-chancellors oppose it because,
they say, it is too prescriptive.
Under the bill the management of teacher training will be passed to an
agency responsible for its funding. It will be expected to move funds from
university departments to schools as part of 'school-based training'.
Professor Peter Mortimore, director of London University's Institute of
Education, said the move would be expensive, as it would create several
thousand providers of teacher-training, rather than the 90 at present.
He suggested that quality would also suffer, because of the added
difficulties of regulating so many schools, each of which would have a
teacher-training capacity.
He added that the government's ability to control the supply of teachers
would be damaged by the measure.
Sex must be placed in the context of morals and family values in school
lessons, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said yesterday. He added:
'Sex education, like moral education, should begin in the home.' Parents
will be allowed to withdraw their children from any lesson including sex
education.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Retail worker 'forced into Sunday contract'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former employee of a London menswear chain claimed yesterday that he had
been forced to accept a contract requiring him to work on Sundays against
his will.
The claim follows earlier allegations that leading retailers such as J.
Sainsbury have put pressure on employees to work on Sundays.
The claim was endorsed enthusiastically by supporters of Sunday shopping
restrictions, who fear that wavering Labour MPs may swing the Commons behind
partial deregulation in a crucial vote tomorrow.
Mr Matthew Phillips, a former supervisor for the Mister Byrite chain, said
he had been given an hour to sign a contract making Sunday a normal working
day.
The revised contract stipulates that Sunday is the first day of the working
week, and that employees will be paid at the company's normal rates.
Mr Phillips, who left the company voluntarily in April, said he signed the
contract because he was told he would be made redundant if he refused.
The details of Mr Phillips' contract were confirmed by Mister Byrite, which
says that 350 other employees accepted the changes without complaints.
Mr Mick O'Connor, general manager, said the contracts were issued to put all
employees on similar terms when it became 'obvious' that the group would
have to trade on Sundays to protect its market share.
Mr O'Connor denied that employees had been forced to sign the contract. He
said, however, that Mr Phillips was told that he should reconsider his
future in retailing if he refused to sign.
The pressure group Keep Sunday Special said the case illustrated the
'worthless' nature of employment protections in the government's Sunday
trading bill, which was given a second reading last week.
MPs will decide in a free vote between three options in the Sunday trading
bill which would replace the widely ignored 1950 Shops Act.
Keep Sunday Special claims majority support for tight restrictions, but is
concerned that some Labour MPs may support a plan backed by the big retail
chains allowing shops to open for six hours.
A third option allowing unrestricted opening is supported by the prime
minister and a majority of the cabinet, but is thought to have little chance
of succeeding.
The group's claims were supported by an analysis of the bill produced by Mr
Keith Ewing, professor of public law at King's College, London, and Dr Simon
Deakin, a Cambridge law lecturer.
Their report says that clauses protecting workers who refuse to work on
Sundays from dismissal or discrimination are too complicated and would be
difficult to enforce.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Test case opens against Abta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A schoolgirl and her teacher yesterday started a High Court test case
against the Association of British Travel Agents over a Pounds 10 holiday
insurance premium that was not repaid when one of its members went out of
business.
Their counsel, Mr Robert Webb QC, told Mr Justice Mitchell that there were
about 25,000 cases, with a value of Pounds 250,000, resting on the outcome,
which would have implications for the travel industry.
Mr Stephen Wallace, the teacher, and Miss Emma Bowerman, the pupil, are
bringing the claim on behalf of 54 other pupils at Nower Hill School,
Pinner, north London.
Mr Webb said Mr Wallace booked the April 1991 trip to the French resort of
Alps D'Huez, near Grenoble, with Adventure Express Travel Services, a member
of Abta.
When the company became insolvent in March 1991 Abta refunded the money paid
except for the compulsory Pounds 10 insurance premium.
Mr Wallace wanted the money from Abta to pay his debt to Skibound, the
operator which took over the trip and had invoiced him for the Pounds 550
due in insurance premiums for all 55 pupils.
The school is asking the judge for a declaration that Abta is obliged under
the terms of its scheme of protection either to reimburse the cost of the
insurance cover for the holiday with Adventure Express Travel Services or to
provide alternative insurance cover. Abta denies liability.
The hearing was adjourned until today.
Big tour operators are to ask the government to start the new airport
departure tax a month later than planned so as not to interfere with next
summer's holiday programme.
The departure tax of Pounds 5 for flights in the European Union and Pounds
10 for trips elsewhere was announced in last week's Budget. It is due to
start on October 1 next year.

unsatisfactory, says a report published yesterday by Ofsted, the education
watchdog, John Authers writes.
But this represents an improvement on last year, when a third of lessons
were unsatisfactory, says the report, the fourth annual survey of teaching
standards in the core national curriculum subjects of English, mathematics
and science.
The report says that the last three years of primary school are a period of
weakness for all three subjects. Teachers need more in-service training, it
says, both for their use of assessment and recording, and to acquire more
knowledge about the mathematical content of the curriculum.
In English 88 per cent of lessons for seven-year-olds were satisfactory, up
from 80 per cent last year. But in secondary schools 'good diagnosis of the
needs of poor readers were rare'.
The report also found that standards in English were not maintained in the
last three years at primary school, with 40 per cent of lessons not keeping
up the good start.
The report was positive on science, saying that the curriculum had secured
'a broad and balanced provision of science education for all pupils'.

A state-backed Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.07bn) finance package paving the way
for equipment sales by Italian companies to Russia's gas industry was signed
in Rome yesterday, Robert Graham reports from Rome.
The 13 1/2 -year credit, organised by the state credit institute,
Mediocredito Centrale, in conjunction with Banca Commerciale, will be
covered by Sace, the export credit guarantee organisation. The main
suppliers will be two subsidiaries of ENI, the state oil concern - Nuovo
Pignone and Snamprogetti.
Italian companies will modernise part of the old Soviet gas production and
supply system, with payment through gas supplies. Some equipment is to be
produced in former Russian military plants.

<TEXT>
The essential element of France's demands was still missing from the latest
farm trade agreement by US and European negotiators in Brussels, Mr Luc
Guyau, president of FNSEA, France's largest farm union, said last night.
He called on the French government to remain vigilant. and said there was no
reason for it to approve any deal on agriculture, 'because it is still not
excluded that there will be no agreement'.
Mr Guyau expressed particular concern at the apparent absence of any
restraint on imports to Europe of US corn gluten feed, which was
increasingly displacing European-grown cereals in animal feed. The French
farm union leader also said he was anxious that the terms of a deal between
the US and the European Union might be made worse by other countries in the
final round of negotiating in Geneva.

FT  07 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Hopes of multilateral steel agreement
dashed - Differences make pact impossible by deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of negotiating a Multilateral Steel Agreement by the Uruguay Round
deadline of December 15 have been dashed by irreconcilable differences
between the US and the European Union. Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade
commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday
agreed to zero tariffs on steel, which had previously been made conditional
on an MSA deal, and to continue MSA negotiations into next year. Zero
tariffs for steel were seen by the EU as essential in securing a balanced
tariff package with the US.
The MSA would have eliminated tariff and non-tariff barriers to steel trade
over 10 years and outlawed production subsidies. But the 36-nation talks
failed to resolve differences over allowable subsidies and the extent to
which US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions should be curbed.
The MSA was conceived as a replacement for voluntary restraints by the EU
and other leading steel exporters to the US market. The voluntary agreement
expired in March 1992. Almost immediately afterwards, the US steel industry
filed a series of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits. Although most of
these were rejected, the move has bedevilled talks ever since.
The EU and others have sought to have existing duties lifted and to obtain
guarantees against future trade harassment, including a pledge by the US not
to take action against subsidies paid out before the MSA came into effect.
However, the US has refused to accept restraints on the right of US industry
to petition against allegedly unfair subsidies, even the few specifically
allowed by the draft MSA for environmental improvements, plant closure,
retraining, and research and development.
Washington still hopes for a MSA deal early next year, before Congress votes
on the Uruguay Round results. If these negotiations fail, steel subsidies
will be governed by the separate draft Uruguay Round subsidies accord. This
lays down in general terms which subventions are prohibited, which are
permissible and which are allowed but can be challenged by anti-subsidy
suits.
In a parallel development, the draft subsidies accord has also been accepted
as the basis for a revised voluntary code of fair trade practice for civil
aircraft.
However, the US and EU are still wrangling over details of the proposed
code, which is intended to generalise their bilateral deal on state supports
for Airbus. The EU, as in steel, wants to ensure that the US cannot
challenge past subsidies while the US is trying to keep subsidies to a
minimum.

FT  07 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Break expected in dark cloud over
Caribbean resorts - Canute James on the region's hopes of a better tourism
season after three bad years that began with the Gulf war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean tourist resorts are expecting better times in the high season,
which begins next week, after the hard times that began with the Gulf war
three years ago and have continued with the recession in the industrialised
economies.
Planners of the industry in the more than 30 member countries of the
Barbados-based Caribbean Tourism Organisation say that signs of economic
improvement in the leading markets such as the US, Canada and Europe
indicated that the flow of tourists next year will be higher than the
expected 22m stay-over and cruise ship visitors of this year.
Tourism brings significant relief for often hard-pressed treasuries, and the
industry is expecting visitor expenditure next year to be about 5 per cent
higher than the estimated USDollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) of this year.
The hoped-for improvement would be due as much to whatever improvement there
is in recession-hit economies, as to a more business-like approach by the
resort countries. Hoteliers once looked anxiously at the weather reports in
North America and Europe, hoping a bad winter would force shivering hordes
southward in search of the sun. Once fiercely competitive with one another,
the resort countries have now implemented a multi-million dollar advertising
programme to market the region as whole to potential visitors from North
America.
There are, however, many problems which could still frustrate the hopes for
better times. Most of these, such as air access to the region, are outside
the control of the industry's administrators. Pan American Airlines and
Eastern Airlines, which were big carriers between the Caribbean and North
America, have collapsed. Although American Airlines has scheduled additional
flights to Caribbean destinations, it is unlikely that any airline will
continue for long with routes of marginal profitability.
Equally damaging for the industry is the realignment of international
currencies. Caribbean hotel rates are US dollar-denominated. A depreciation
of European currencies against the US dollar makes the Caribbean less of a
bargain to European tourists. Potential visitors from the US may also
consider a European holiday a better buy.
The Caribbean is also facing new and growing competition for the US tourist.
Several states in the US have stepped up their promotion and marketing as
safer and cheaper alternatives to a foreign holiday. A domestic holiday can
be appealing to prospective tourists in the US because it does not carry the
uncertainties of factors such as currency changes.
A further problem is crime. The CTO said this year the level of crime had
been increasing in most resorts. Attacks on tourists in several countries,
and the murder of two in the past two years in Jamaica, have caused concern
among the administrators of the industry in the region, who fear, with good
reason, that adverse publicity would deter prospective visitors.
Some Caribbean governments have concluded that their economies are not
getting enough out of tourism. This led some unilaterally to increase the
tax on cruise shipping companies for each visitor who disembarks. The
members of the CTO wanted a uniform minimum head tax of USDollars 10, but
some members balked after the cruise lines objected. After some confusion
and confrontation with the shipping lines, a common minimum passenger tax of
Dollars 5 effective next April, rising to Dollars 10 in October 1995, has
been agreed.
There is also growing concern at the extent to which local sectors and
services benefit from tourism. 'What we in the Caribbean have to do is to
develop linkages and so benefit more from tourism,' says Sir Neville
Nicholls, president of the Caribbean Development Bank.
'There is too much concentration merely on seeing tourism or activity in the
tourism industry as essentially hotel-based. While that is the core, it's
the linkages to tourism - agriculture, services, transportation and so on -
which need to be emphasised.'
The overriding concern in the industry is that the quality of the product
must be protected, and earnings increased, while the region improves its
ability to attract tourists who may turn to increasingly competitive
alternatives such as Mexico and the Pacific. After all, tourism now accounts
for one in every four foreign dollars earned by the resort countries of the
Caribbean.

FT  07 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Seoul braced for rice protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean government is braced for possible violent protests after
reports emerged from Geneva that the government had agreed in principle to
open the country's rice market as part of the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
Police are being placed on alert for a mass rally by farmers today in
central Seoul to protest at the decision.
Korea is seeking a 10-year grace period before adopting a system of tariffs
protecting local farmers. During this time, it would allow minimum access to
foreign rice, rising from 3 per cent of total rice consumption at the outset
to 5 per cent at the end of the grace period. Korean negotiators are also
pressing for a moratorium on introduction of the minimum access arrangement.
Pressure on Korea to reach a compromise has mounted strongly over the past
week as it has become clear that Japan, which also has a ban on rice
imports, has negotiated a six-year moratorium, with market access rising
from 4 to 8 per cent.
International trade negotiators have been increasingly unwilling to regard
Korea as a developing country, and thus concede to it the 'special and
differential status' which allows poorer countries to seek exemption from
Gatt rules.
In parallel with the rice issue, it has faced extreme pressure to open its
financial services markets. Top US Treasury negotiators arrived in Geneva
yesterday to tackle this issue not just with Korea, but with Japan and other
newly industrialising Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia
and Thailand.
The rice issue has posed the toughest political challenge to President Kim
Young-sam since he came to office in February and threatens to damage his
popularity. Mr Kim has until now enjoyed wide public support because of his
political reforms.
The president's decision to open the rice market is seen as a key test of
his commitment to make the centralised and protectionist economy more
outward looking.
Government officials explained that Korea had little choice but to lift its
rice import ban if it was to avoid retaliatory measures against exports of
its manufactured goods.
Korea has barred foreign rice by arguing that imports would threaten the
survival of at least a fifth of the nation's 6m farmers. Rice, which
accounts for 22 per cent of total farm produce, is the country's most
important agricultural product.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Buying into Argentina was the easy bit: John Barham on the
problems faced by the new owners of former state companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina has, in just three years, privatised almost all its state
companies, bringing in Dollars 19.1bn (Pounds 12.8bn) and attracting some of
the biggest names in international business.
Yet many of the new owners have had to learn how to do business in Argentina
the hard way. Turning chaotic state-owned companies into profitable
businesses has not been easy.
Few have suffered as many setbacks as Iberia, Spain's state-owned airline.
Soon after Iberia bought into the national airline Aerolineas Argentinas in
1990, it found its local partners were insolvent. Then it began squabbling
with the government over payment terms. The two reached a compromise only 18
months after the privatisation.
Iberia handled relations with employees badly. It cut jobs by a third to
6,800, leading to weeks of strikes and demonstrations. This further worsened
Aerolneas's fearsome reputation for rudeness and unreliability. At the
height of the unrest last year, less than half its aircraft flew on time.
Now it claims that 90 per cent of flights are on time.
Meanwhile, Aerolineas bled cash. The consortium led by Iberia paid Dollars
1.87bn in a cash and debt-for-equity swap for 85 per cent of the airline,
but has already lost more than Dollars 300m.
Mr Manuel Moran, president of Aerolineas, says that only with the end of
Iberia's battle with the government has he been able to start reshaping the
company. He is enlarging and modernising the fleet, strengthening links with
other Iberia-controlled airlines and developing Buenos Aires as a regional
hub.
However, Iberia says Aerolineas needs about Dollars 500m in fresh funds to
rebuild its balance sheet and buy new aircraft. But the government, which
still owns a third of Aerolineas, says it will not contribute its share.
Iberia retorts that Aerolineas may collapse early next year without the cash
injection.
The new owners of Argentina's former state companies have had other
problems, not least the fact that all were riddled with corruption. Telecom
Argentina, a telephone company jointly run by the French and Italian state
telephone operators, set up an anti-corruption unit after privatisation in
1990. The unit caught a top executive demanding bribes from suppliers. He
was discreetly sacked and the affair hushed up.
British Gas, which led a consortium of local blue-chip energy companies to
bid Dollars 300m for the Buenos Aires gas distribution company Metrogas last
December, says it tried to avoid such problems by carrying out due diligence
procedures and vetting employees' backgrounds.
Mr Russell Herbert, managing director of Global Gas, the company's
international arm, also says he tried to value Metrogas as accurately as
possible before bidding. This may seem obvious, but Mr Herbert says that
'some of the bids made by other companies were startling, to say the least'.
Winning the loyalty of employees is another vital step. Mr Juan Masjoan,
Telecom's president, says: 'The really difficult thing is changing the
company culture - to make it customer-oriented, to decentralise without
losing control. It is very difficult to change the company without getting
people involved.'
Telecom has avoided serious unrest even though it sacked 4,500 employees and
tightened slack working practices. Morale improved because it raised wages,
improved training and offered better promotion prospects for those who
remained.
British Gas found that employees responded well to the company's approach,
less authoritarian than they had been accustomed to in the state sector. Mr
Rob Verrion, Metrogas president, says that on taking over he found 'people
who had never seen a manager. They could not believe that anyone was taking
an interest in them.' Employees even came into the office on their days-off
to attend training courses.
Mr Masjoan could be speaking for all privatised companies as he reels off
his list of priorities: doubling productivity, raising investment in
training and data processing, reducing management layers and internal
bureaucracy.
Nonetheless, Argentina's telephone system remains expensive and unreliable.
As a result, competition from US-based call-back companies, offering 50 per
cent discounts on international calls, is eroding the local industry's most
profitable segment.
Handling the government, the press and public opinion are probably the
trickiest problems of all. This is inevitable anywhere, given the
conflicting interests of companies, regulators and consumers. However, the
difficulties may be exaggerated in a poor country such as Argentina.
In May, a judge ordered the arrest of Mr Angel Zapalorto, a manager of
Buenos Aires electricity distributor Edenor, after he cut off power to slums
to stop illegal tapping into the electricity network.
Mr Zapalorto spent 72 hours in jail before being released. Edenor,
part-owned by Electricite de France, last year lost Dollars 50m on sales of
Dollars 700m, and claims electricity theft cost it Dollars 150m.
As the novelty of privatisation wears off, Argentines are demanding better
service to justify their sharply increased utility bills, particularly when
some companies, such as the telephone operators, are reporting huge profits.
Dissatisfied consumers are beginning to demand stiffer government
regulation. Executives are aware that even though they may be running
private companies, their performance remains a public issue.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Talks stalled as Menem rejects plan to curb his authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between Argentina's government and the opposition over reforming the
country's constitution stalled yesterday after President Carlos Menem
rejected plans to reduce his authority, John Barham reports.
Mr Menem said he would not accept the broad powers proposed for a prime
ministerial figure as part of an accord reached with the opposition Radical
party to amend the constitution and allow him to stand for a second term
when his mandate ends in July 1995.
Mr Ricardo Gil Lavedra, a senior opposition negotiator, said the accord was
'blocked' because the Radicals would only support re-election if the
president's sweeping powers were reduced and the power of Congress and the
judiciary strengthened.
In exchange for backing re-election, the Radicals won promises from the
ruling Peronist party to increase their representation in Congress, the
judiciary and the government.
Earlier, Mr Menem said he would ask Congress to vote this week on reforming
the constitution. Both houses of Congress must vote two-thirds in favour of
amending the constitution before elections can be called to a constituent
assembly to write the new text. Mr Menem's resistance is the first serious
obstacle.

Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia have concluded negotiations on a free trade
pact to come into effect in the first half of next year, according to
Mexico's trade ministry.
The treaty will bring together economies with a combined population of about
150m, and gross domestic product of more than Dollars 360bn (Pounds
241.60bn) in 1991.
Mexico has already signed trade pacts with the US and Canada, and separately
with Chile. Colombia yesterday signed a free trade agreement with Chile.
The agreement between the 'Group of Three' will have only a small economic
impact, since trade between them is a small part of their total trade.
However, the agreement marks a step in Latin America's quest for economic
integration and closer political co-operation.
Mexico's trade ministry gave no details of the agreement, except that it
covered six areas: access to markets; rules of origins; investment rules;
government purchases; trade in services and intellectual property. Tariffs
will be gradually phased out, rather than abolished immediately.
The Chile-Colombia accord, details of which were hammered out last month,
scraps non-tariff barriers on all but the most 'sensitive' products from the
start of next year.
From 1994, tariffs on 300 products, including coffee, wood pulp and
synthetic fibres, will be cut by a quarter. The remaining 75 per cent of
barriers and all customs taxes will be removed by 1999.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Caldera breaks mould in Venezuela

<TEXT>
Mr Rafael Caldera, a 77-year-old lawyer, has won the presidential election
in Venezuela, according to official figures released yesterday by the
Supreme Electoral Council.
The outcome represents a big shift in modern Venezuelan politics.
Mr Caldera, running as an independent supported by 17 small political
parties, broke the control that the country's two mainstream political
parties, Democratic Action (represented in the presidential race by Mr
Claudio Fermn) and the Christian Democrat Copei party (represented by Mr
Oswaldo Alvarez Paz) have exercised over the presidency for 35 years.
Mr Caldera, who founded Copei in 1946, left the party he created to launch
his presidential candidacy.
The outcome also is a defeat for advocates of free-market economic policies,
which began to be implemented in Venezuela in 1989. Caldera and Velasquez
opposed these policies; Fermn and Alvarez backed them.
Votes from the poll on Sunday are still being counted but Mr Caldera, who
was president in 1969-74, had 28.5 per cent of tallied votes yesterday,
followed by Mr Velasquez with 27 per cent, Mr Alvarez with 22 per cent, and
Mr Fermn with 21 per cent.
Mr Fermn, a former mayor, recognised Mr Caldera's victory on Sunday night.
Mr Velasquez, a labour leader, and Mr Alvarez, a former state governor,
followed suit yesterday. There were no results yesterday in the
congressional races held on Sunday, but the next Congress is expected to be
fragmented, rather than dominated by Democratic Action and Copei as it was.
Mr Caldera, speaking to reporters, said that he did notknow which aspects of
the free-market reform programme in place would be discarded.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Mexican economy contracts sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mexico's economy shrank by 1.2 per cent in the third quarter of 1993,
compared to the equivalent period last year, by far the worst performance in
the five-year administration of President Carlos Salinas.
The manufacturing sector contracted by more than 5 per cent in the quarter.
The economy, especially private investment, was hit by the government's
restrictive monetary policy and by uncertainty over the North America Free
Trade Agreement, said Mr Jonathan Heath, head of Macro Asesoria Economica, a
consultancy in Mexico.
The government prefers to blame the slowdown on a weak world economy and
restructuring of the private sector, much of whose productive capital has
become obsolete as a result of Mexico's rapid trade liberalisation.
The finance ministry said the economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the first nine
months, compared to the equivalent period last year. The service sector
expanded by 1.4 per cent, while the industrial sector contracted by 0.3 per
cent and agriculture by 1.2 per cent. The manufacturing sector shrank by 1.5
per cent in the nine months to September.
The third-quarter figures were much worse than expected said Mr Rogelio
Ramrez de la O, of the consultancy Ecanal. He was revising downwards his
forecast for annual growth to 0.8 per cent for this year. The government's
most recent forecast is for growth of 1.1 per cent.
Mexico's government kept interest rates high throughout most of the year and
ran a budget surplus in an effort to maintain confidence in the economy in
the run-up to the vote in the US Congress on the free trade agreement. While
such a policy ensured a remarkably strong peso throughout the year, and has
helped reduce the trade deficit, the real side of the economy suffered.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Arafat insists Israelis stick to deadline

<TEXT>
Rising Arab-Jewish bloodshed and deepening tension between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation threatened the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process yesterday, as PLO chairman Yassir Arafat insisted Israel stick to a
deadline six days away for the start of military withdrawal.
In the first of three incidents, Palestinian gunmen killed a Jewish settler
and his son and wounded three children in an ambush in Hebron, flashpoint of
recent Arab-Jewish tension, where Jewish settlers toting guns attacked Arab
vehicles. Two other settlers were wounded in a firebomb attack on a bus near
the occupied West Bank village of al-Jib. Israeli undercover troops shot
dead a Palestinian outside his house near Rammalah in the West Bank.
The latest killings are bound to inflame the tit-for-tat violence which has
left at least 18 Israelis and 34 Palestinians dead since the peace agreement
was signed in September, and raised to five the number of Israelis killed by
Palestinians in the past five days.
Israel's premier Yitzhak Rabin yesterday condemned the Palestinian killings
of Jewish settlers. 'I have no doubt the goal of the Palestinians who did
this terrible murder (they have just one goal) is to create a chain of
events that will bring the negotiations to an end.'
Mr Rabin rejected Mr Arafat's demand that Israel keep its promise and start
withdrawing troops from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of
Jericho next Monday. A two-to-three-week delay was inevitable because both
sides had yet to reach agreement on security, military and economic issues,
he said.
Israel welcomed two humanitarian gestures by Syria to grant exit permits to
Syrian Jews and co-operate in searching for seven missing Israeli soldiers.
The moves were seen in Jerusalem as confidence-building signs of progress in
the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, the focus of current Middle East
shuttle diplomacy by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
Mr Arafat, who met Mr Christopher in Amman yesterday, said he had asked the
US to press Israel to meet its obligations under the Israeli-Palestinian
peace accord and start the phased troop withdrawal next Monday. Mr
Christopher has refused to intervene, but has urged 'timely implementation'
of the agreement. He is due to return to Damascus on Thursday after another
round of talks with Israeli leaders.
In Cairo, where the two sides are seeking agreement on military and security
issues, Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the talks were at a
standstill. The two sides have yet to agree the size of the Jericho area and
the control of border crossings. Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres said
they were near agreement providing for Israeli control of the crossings but
with a Palestinian presence.
In Paris, Israeli finance minister Avraham Shochat met Mr Ahmed Qurie to try
to advance talks on future economic relations between Israel and the
Palestinian economy. Disagreements focus on an Israeli proposal for a
customs union with harmonisation of taxes and duties.

The action is thought to involve 700-800 workers, and to be related to

<TEXT>
A feud within the family of Pakistan's prime minister Benazir Bhutto erupted
afresh yesterday when Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, her mother, challenged her own
overthrow as co-chairperson of Ms Bhutto's ruling Pakistan People's Party,
Farhan Bokhari writes from Islamabad.
The CEC party's central executive committee decided on Sunday to replace Mrs
Bhutto senior by transferring all powers to the prime minister. Before that,
the two women had equal ranking in the party.
'No one can remove me. I was nominated as chairperson for life by my
husband, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and I will not allow anybody to throw his
decision into the dustbin,' Mrs Bhutto senior, 63, said in Karachi
yesterday.
Mrs Bhutto was appointed to chair the party in 1977 after her husband was
arrested following a military takeover. He was hanged two years later. The
two women became co-chairpersons in 1986 after Ms Benazir Bhutto returned
from exile.
Recently, they have appeared increasingly estranged over the future of Mr
Murtaza Bhutto, the prime minister's brother, who returned from exile last
month and has been in prison since. Mr Bhutto was arrested on charges that
he ran a terrorism campaign against the military regime of the late Gen
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. Mrs Bhutto wants her son to chair the party.
The split threatens to produce a splinter group which would dent the PPP's
support base.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Ministry stops Hosokawa in his economic tracks: Japanese PM
shelves stimulus plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The complexities of coalition politics, a new experience for Japan, have
plunged the government's economic policies into apparent confusion.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is in a tight spot. Over the past week he
has been forced to delay plans for political reform - on which he has staked
his own survival - to make way for action on the economy, only to run into a
new blockage.
This one is the result of a dispute between the powerful Finance Ministry
and the Social Democratic party, the biggest member of his seven-party
coalition, as a result of which Mr Hosokawa has been forced to delay the
latest round of measures to stimulate the economy.
Mr Hosokawa told a parliamentary panel yesterday that the government was
planning no special economic stimulus, contrary to his own indications last
week that the government was planning new pump-priming measures.
The plan last week was partly in response to a collapse in share prices on
another set of grim economic statistics and suspicions that the government
was not prepared to do any more to stimulate the economy. The market slid
again yesterday when it heard that the plan was off for the time being.
'Because of the extraordinary difficulty in trying to boost the economy, the
government's power base has been steadily eroded by the Finance Ministry,'
explains Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at Tokyo University. 'Mr
Hosokawa may keep going for up to a year, but his room for manoeuvre is
increasingly limited.'
The possibility of an economic package, which would have been the fourth
this year, was first raised at a meeting last Tuesday between Mr Hirohisa
Fujii, finance minister, and Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, who holds the portfolio at
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, to discuss how to respond
to the market slide and the latest economic figures. Miti is understood to
have called the meeting, under pressure from an anxious business community.
Options included a long-debated income tax cut, relaxation of rules on land
and housing sales and moves to revive the stock market. Two days later, a
gathering between Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and a close
ally of Mr Hosokawa, and the policy-makers from coalition parties agreed to
launch a package along these lines early this week.
The official explanation for shelving the plan is that the government first
needs parliamentary agreement on a Y708bn (Pounds 4.5bn) supplementary
budget, needed to finance the previous economic package launched in
September. Further stimulus measures could be included in next year's
budget, due to be published in the final week of this month, said Mr
Takemura yesterday.
All this suggests that the four-month-old government's inexperience is a
factor in the hiatus. On top of this, it ran into bad luck when a former
cabinet minister, Mr Keisuke Nakanishi, responsible for the defence agency,
brought parliament to a halt for a valuable day by suggesting the
constitution be revised to allow Japanese troops to play a larger United
Nations role. That inconvenient sideshow cost Mr Nakanishi his job.
Yet there remains an unresolved dispute between the socialists and the
Finance Ministry over government funding. The finance bureaucrats can only
accept an income tax cut on condition that the loss of government revenue
will be covered by a rise in consumption tax. On their side they have the
influential coalition partner, the Japan Renewal party.
The socialists cannot accept a rise in sales tax, on the grounds that it
would hit their electoral heartland, lower-income voters. So the socialists
propose deficit bonds instead, anathema to the Finance Ministry at a time
when it risks an explosion of public debt, according to a report last week
on Japan by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr
Hosokawa stands in the middle and has sensibly kept his public
pronouncements free of detail on this subject.
Most analysts believe that given time, the coalition partners will be able
to strike a compromise on tax. They have after all, got close to agreeing on
a gradual opening of the rice market, a perennially touchy issue. This
matter, on which the coalition is just as divided as on tax, has been
handled with surprisingly little fuss, perhaps helped by Japanese rice
farmers' relative compliance.
'I am sure we will get some form of package. But first Mr Hosokawa has to
balance the interests of the Finance Ministry, which he cannot afford to
offend, against those of the stock market,' says Mr Jesper Koll, chief
economist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
The embattled Mr Hosokawa might take a little comfort from the thought that
despite the challenges on every side, nobody wants to bring him down yet.
For his popularity continues to increase - and no mainstream party would
gain from killing a government devoted to political reform.

FT  07 DEC 93 / UK talks offer on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is proposing fresh talks with China later this month to try to
bridge outstanding differences on Hong Kong, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, said yesterday.
In a conciliatory statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hurd left MPs in no
doubt that the government backed Governor Chris Patten's decision to defy
Beijing by pushing ahead with the first stage of his democracy legislation.
But he claimed there was 'no argument' with China over the principle that
Hong Kong's democratic institutions should continue to develop - just over
how the principle should be 'turned into practical arrangements'.
Mr Hurd said Britain had offered 'important moves' over 17 rounds of talks
to accommodate Chinese views on issues relating to its resumption of
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, without compromising 'essential' British
requirements. The underlying question was simple: would Britain bequeath to
Hong Kong 'an open and democratic system offering the electorate a genuine
choice' or 'a system based on small electorates open to manipulation and
corruption'?
The next meeting between British and Chinese officials is due to take place
in London today but officials in Hong Kong expect little headway.
The meeting of the Joint Liaison Group - a bilateral forum for processing
the practical aspects of Hong Kong's transfer to China - comes against a
background of escalating Chinese hostility towards British administration in
the territory.
The two governments are at odds over Mr Patten's plans for democracy in the
colony, a dispute which has bedevilled bi-lateral co-operation. Mr Patten is
expected to gazette the first stage of democracy legislation on Friday,
before its formal presentation in the Legislative Council, the colony's
law-making body, next Wednesday.
This week's meeting is seen in Hong Kong as a test of China's promise not to
let differences about the colony's political development get in the way of
broader factors.

Rising Arab-Jewish bloodshed and deepening tension between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation threatened the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process yesterday as Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, insisted Israel stick
to a deadline six days away for the start of military withdrawal.
One Palestinian and two Israelis were shot dead in separate incidents of
violence.
Mr Arafat's demand that Israel keep its promise and start withdrawing troops
from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho next Monday was
rejected yesterday by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, who said a
delay of two to three weeks was inevitable because both sides have yet to
reach agreement on security, military and economic issues.
Israel meanwhile welcomed two humanitarian gestures made by Syria, which
will grant exit permits to Syrian Jews and co-operate in the search for
seven missing Israeli soldiers. The moves were widely interpreted in
Jerusalem as confidence-building signs of progress on the stalled
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which are the focus of current Middle East
shuttle diplomacy by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
In Amman Mr Arafat, who met Mr Christopher yesterday, said he had asked the
US to put pressure on Israel to meet its obligations under the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and start a phased troop withdrawal next
Monday. Mr Christopher called for 'timely implementation'.
Mr Arafat's insistence on the December 13 deadline follows a week of
violence between Israelis and Palestinians amid fears that extremists on
both sides are stepping up tension.
Yesterday, gunmen fired on an car, killing two Israeli settlers in the
occupied West Bank town of Hebron. Israeli undercover troops shot dead a
Palestinian as he sat in front of his house in a West Bank village.
In Cairo, where the two sides are discussing military and security issues,
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the talks were at a standstill.
The two sides have yet to agree the size of the Jericho area and who will
control border crossings. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said
the two sides were near to agreement providing for Israeli control of the
crossings but with a Palestinian presence.
In Paris Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, met Mr Ahmed Qurie
(also known as Abu Ala) to examine the future relations between Israel and
the Palestinian economy. Disagreements focus on an Israeli proposal for a
customs union with the harmonisation of taxes and duties.
Mr Rabin said the Syrian gesture on Israeli soldiers was 'an important step
forward'. After talks with President Hafez al Assad of Syria on Sunday Mr
Christopher said Damascus had agreed to help with the search for seven
missing Israeli soldiers and to grant exit visas by the end of the year to
all Syrian Jews who wished to leave the country.
Mr Christopher said he would return to Damascus on Thursday after holding a
second round of talks with Israeli leaders this morning.

FT  07 DEC 93 / White rule comes to an end in Africa today: Patti Waldmeir
reports on a multi-racial transitional government in Cape Town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 350 years of white domination in South Africa will formally end today
in Cape Town when blacks take their seats on a multi-racial Transitional
Executive Council charged with overseeing government until all-race
elections in April next year.
Ironically, the first meeting of the 20-party TEC will be held on the
premises of the President's Council, a body set up by the hardline
then-President P. W. Botha in the 1980s to ensure that whites could always
overrule deputies classified coloured (mixed-race) and Indian in the
tricameral parliament from which blacks were excluded.
The similarity ends there: for contrary to the government's original plans
for the TEC, it is likely to find it hard to veto decisions of the council.
Though President F. W. de Klerk continues to insist that the TEC will not be
able to bypass the government, political realities could dictate
differently.
The government will find it extremely difficult to ignore TEC decisions, and
with most of its potential allies refusing to join the council, it has
little hope of out-voting the African National Congress bloc.
The TEC's remit, set out in legislation passed last September, is so vague
as to be either meaningless or limitless. It is charged with 'levelling the
political playing field' and creating the conditions for free and fair
elections on April 27. As ANC officials point out, with elections dominating
South Africa's political life, virtually any government action could be
interpreted as coming within the TEC's authority.
Still, the council is unlikely to have the time, the personnel or the
experience to intervene in any but the most crucial decisions. Overall, its
powers are more negative than positive: it can stop certain things from
happening, but cannot initiate action. But some of these 'negative' powers
are important: it can veto the deployment of army units to combat political
unrest; its assent is necessary to declare a state of emergency; and no
foreign loans can be raised without its approval.
The TEC will have seven sub-councils, covering law and order, defence,
intelligence, finance, regional and local government, foreign affairs, and
the status of women. The first three are likely to prove the most important,
providing for limited joint control of the security forces in the volatile
period before the elections. No state of emergency or period of martial law
can be declared without its support, though the Police Board and the Special
Electoral Court, respectively, can overrule it in these matters.
The TEC itself will comprise one member from each political party or
government which participated in the multi-party talks which last month
adopted a new constitution. The Afrikaner Volksunie, the right-wing white
party has refused to participate in the TEC. So has Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom party who has said that the government of
the KwaZulu black homeland, which he heads, will not respect the TEC's
authority.
Last-minute efforts were made yesterday to get Inkatha and other right-wing
parties to accept the new constitution and join the TEC before parliament
adopts the constitution finally, sometime before Christmas. But they seem
unlikely to do so, raising the prospect of further bloodshed when the TEC
tries to impose its authority in homeland areas.
The TEC will take decisions by consensus, or by a 75 per cent majority where
that fails. Sub-councils will require either a two-thirds majority (finance)
or three-quarters (defence, law and order). It is likely to prove a test of
the system of consensus decision-making which Mr De Klerk's National party
is counting on to prevail in the government of national unity which is due
to take office after the elections. The government, virtually isolated on
its councils, will be unable to block decisions taken by the majority bloc.
The TEC is likely to be dominated by two men: Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary
general of the ANC, and Mr Roelf Meyer, minister of constitutional
development. They know each other well, having met almost daily for months
to negotiate the new constitution. Delegates from the South African
Communist party, the liberal Democratic party, the ruling National party
(which has a separate delegation) and a host of other small black parties
will also be represented. The council will sit only until the elections in
April.

Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, yesterday urged a 'cooling
off period' in the diplomatic row between his country and Malaysia before it
develops into a full-blown trade dispute.
'It's in nobody's interest that the present problem with Malaysia escalates
any further,' said Mr Evans.
'I hope very much the Malaysian cabinet may be prepared to accept a
cooling-off period, a pause for reflection before taking further punitive or
retaliatory measures of the kind that have been foreshadowed.'
The Malaysian cabinet is due to discuss the issue tomorrow and there is
apprehension in Australia that diplomatic relations between the two
countries may be downgraded with Malaysia imposing sanctions on Australian
goods and services.
The row between the two countries broke after Mr Keating, Australia's prime
minister, described Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his Malaysian counterpart, as a
recalcitrant for not attending last month's Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation summit in Seattle.
Malaysia says a letter sent by Mr Keating to Dr Mahathir stops short of an
apology and various Malaysian government departments have been directed to
curtail contacts with Australia.
Yesterday a scheduled meeting in Kuala Lumpur between Mr Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi, Malaysia's foreign minister, and Mr Peter Cook, the visiting
Australian trade minister, was cancelled by Malaysian officials.

Japan's ministry of health and welfare is facing mounting public criticism
for considering approval of an anti-cancer drug which has led to the deaths
of 20 among 477 patients during clinical tests.
The disclosure follows a case where 14 people died after taking a shingles
drug since it was launched last September. It may heighten calls for tighter
approval guidelines by the Japanese government, which is trying to increase
the international competitiveness of the country's drug industry by
encouraging companies to become more innovative.
Irinotecan hydrochloride, jointly developed by Yakult Honsha and Daiichi
Pharmaceutical, is believed to be effective in curing lung, uterine and
ovarian cancer. However, in clinical tests, 27 people died within a month of
taking the drug, of which 20 deaths were caused by the drug's side-effects.
A majority of the patients who underwent test treatment showed side-effects;
some 80 per cent showed a decrease in the number of white blood corpuscles,
and more than half suffered from diarrhoea or nausea.
Treatment using anti-cancer drugs is known to cause severe side-effects, and
Daiichi officials deny suggestions that the number of deaths and patients
suffering from side-effects are higher relative to other cancer drugs.
The drug was approved last week by the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs
Council and the ministry is due to decide next month whether it can be put
on the market.
In the case of deaths following sorivudine, the shingles drug, the health
ministry blamed doctors for not reading warnings against the combined use of
the drug with an anti-cancer treatment, while doctors have criticised the
ministry and Nippon Shoji, the drug company, for not placing stricter
warnings on the drug.

<TEXT>
Indonesia's air force has been given the official go-ahead to discuss buying
16 more Hawk aircraft from British Aerospace, foreign aviation officials
say, Reuter reports from Jakarta. BAe won an Indonesian order in June for 24
Hawk trainers and ground-attack fighters worth about Pounds 500m. The first
aircraft are due to be delivered in 1996.
The officials said the air force, with some 80 combat aircraft, had been
told by the government it could proceed with talks for more Hawks but it was
not clear when negotiations would start. An air force spokesman confirmed
the need for more aircraft.
Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, Britain's chief of air staff, visited
Jakarta last week for talks with military leaders. His visit came shortly
after BAe said it might set up joint ventures with Indonesia on turboprop
aircraft and cars.
Indonesia's military chief, Gen Feisal Tanjung, confirmed in June the
country planned to buy about 100 new warplanes over 25 years. US-designed
aircraft, including F-16 Fighting Falcons, F-5E Tigers and A-4E Skyhawks,
form the backbone of Indonesia's present air-combat capability.

FT  07 DEC 93 / VW believes itself cleared: Criminal probe seen as private
affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 10 weeks' rooting about in the databases and filing cabinets of
Volkswagen's Wolfsburg headquarters, auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand
recently published selected highlights of a report. In the words of the man
who ordered the investigation, it concluded: 'There are no clues that
industrial espionage took place to the benefit of Volkswagen.'
Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the VW supervisory board and overseer of the
group's corporate conduct, repeated it at dictation pace to ensure the
assembled journalists got it right.
The investigation, and a criminal inquiry that is still going on, began
after General Motors in the US alleged that former GM employees who defected
to VW in March took with them huge quantities of confidential and
market-sensitive company documents.
Mr Liesen, chairman of the Ruhrgas energy group, chose his words carefully
at the recent press conference. He generated two clear impressions. The
first was that he believed Volkswagen - the company as a legal entity - did
not possess and had not made illegal use of any competitors' secrets. Mr
Liesen seemed satisfied by the auditors' claims that material found at
Wolfsburg which did not originate from VW's own sources was not
confidential.
The second - more puzzling - was that the continuing criminal investigation
of four senior VW employees for suspected theft of masses of confidential
data from their former employer, General Motors, was neither his nor VW's
concern. In other words, that the actions of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, VW group production director, and close associates Mr Jorge
Manuel Gutierrez, Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Rosario Piazza, were
strictly their own affair.
The four men arrived in Wolfsburg virtually simultaneously last March,
followed by clouds of suspicion generated by alleged information-gathering
activities in the latter part of their service at GM and its German
subsidiary Adam Opel.
As the KPMG report confirmed, within days of their arrival, two of them were
busy in VW's Rotehof guesthouse unpacking, sorting, and destroying 'in
part', the contents of 20 cartons delivered to Mr Lopez. It also emerged
that they found time to make several thousand photocopies while feeding the
shredder.
The box contents, according to Mr Lopez and his colleagues comprised books,
magazines, seminar material, hand-written notes, brochures and
correspondence with GM component suppliers.
However, the KPMG investigators, who claim elsewhere to have employed the
most sophisticated techniques to try to detect the presence of GM group
secrets (how they managed this without cross-checking VW's database with
those of GM/Opel is unclear) admitted they were unable 'fully to establish'
the whereabouts of material left unshredded. They merely reported that Mr
Lopez's lawyer told them the remaining 'books and magazines' had been sent
to his office and his home.
Nor were the KPMG sleuths, who were given a free rein to dig and question
within VW, able to discover what was photocopied in the Rotehof, even though
they know the copies did not go into the shredder. Claims from Mr Lopez's
colleagues that it was 'VW information material' for the Spaniard's team
remained unsubstantiated, and KPMG had to be satisfied with their
protestations that they 'could not remember' what they had done with the
copies.
The auditors also failed to pursue the paper chase beyond Wolfsburg. They
did not, for example, investigate subsequent key events, known to VW
management, including a visit to VW's Kassel works in Germany by Mr Lopez's
subordinates, who collected a shredder and 'disappeared' for several days.
Kassel, some 150km south of Wolfsburg, is midway between the VW headquarters
and the former home of Mr Piazza and Mr Alvarez in Wiesbaden where,
witnesses allege, the duo filled a van 'metres high' with sacks of shredded
paper in mid-April.
A good two months later police recovered from the Wiesbaden house four boxes
containing secret Opel price and model data. This find, in the words of the
prosecutor's office, took the investigation 'a decisive step forward'.
According to KPMG, three of the cartons originated in VW's Rotehof
guesthouse. According to Mr Lopez's colleagues, lamely reported by the
auditors, they took empty boxes from Wolfsburg to Wiesbaden. The origin of
the contents found in the cartons later was not explained by KPMG.
And that, in Mr Liesen's view, is the end of the story.
Meanwhile, Ms Dorothea Holland, the state prosecutor leading the German
criminal investigation against Mr Lopez and his men, continues her
meticulous probings.
At hand is material equivalent to a tiny fraction of that apparently combed
and declared non-confidential by KPMG.
It comprises computer data, seized in a raid on VW in August, and known to
contain material copied from GM and Opel documents.
According to Ms Holland's office, this little file alone would generate 2.5m
pieces of paper if printed out.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Piech sees 'fat duck' carmaker ready to take off again in a
year: Volkswagen chairman presents medium-term strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fat duck of the German motor industry will be fit for take-off in around
12 months. With a following wind it will then soar, landing once a year to
lay golden eggs in the laps of patient shareholders.
That is the plan, presented late last month to members of the Volkswagen
group's supervisory board, by chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech. Under his
medium-term strategy, VW will return a pre-tax profit of over DM4bn (Pounds
1.5bn) in 1998.
The board, which at the same meeting swallowed the bitter pill of a looming
DM2bn deficit this year, nodded and rubber-stamped Mr Piech's project for
off-loading more ballast. Out will go 50,000 more of the group's 245,000
worldwide workforce. Out also are earlier commitments to DM10bn of capital
spending.
In are schemes to put some 100,000 German workers on a cost-saving four-day
week, and to increase group vehicle output by a third, to almost 4m.
Together with current programmes to push down component suppliers' prices by
up to 30 per cent, and build all group models on three basic platforms with
mostly common parts beneath the skins, the 1994/1998 medium-term strategy
completes Mr Piech's fitness diet.
Mr Piech, who personally described VW as a duck grown too fat to fly, has in
the past 12 months piloted the group through the worst slump in the European
motor industry since the war. The flak thrown up by General Motors and its
German subsidiary, Adam Opel, over the alleged theft of their strategic,
model and pricing secrets by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, has
threatened VW's stability.
Now the chairman is striving to convince markets that his company is heading
upwards, out of reach of gunfire and away from the danger of crashing under
its own weight. VW's recent statements suggest that it could be close to
breaking even within a year.
But group negotiators have yet to find a way out of a minefield in Spain,
where some 9,000 Seat workers are scheduled to lose their jobs as a result
of the closure of a redundant factory in Barcelona. The company also has to
restore its fortunes in the US market - where sales are down 37 per cent in
the first 11 months of this year - and Japan.
Nor are VW's domestic problems clearly under control. While independent
observers support company claims that cost-saving team working and
continuous improvement programmes have been eagerly and effectively
implemented by the workforce, the unprecedented four-day-week scheme has yet
to be approved and put into practice. Hopes of saving DM1.8bn in 1994
through the scheme depend at least in part on the government's agreeing to
contribute funds from its unemployment pay budget for workers laid off
temporarily.
Furthermore, Mr Piech is already suggesting that the scheme - and the
associated income sacrifices - may have to run for longer than the two years
originally planned. No more than 28.8 hours a week would be worked at VW for
the 'foreseeable future', he said in an interview published yesterday.
Meanwhile, his medium-term plan foresees a further reduction in the German
workforce. From the present payroll of 103,000 employees building 1.4m
vehicles a year, some 88,000 will be left in 1998, building 1.9m cars and
vans.
Even more uncertain is the future of the chairman's right-hand man, Mr
Lopez, instigator of the production and components purchasing revolution
within the group.
A recent internal audit apparently cleared Volkswagen of involvement in
suspicions of industrial espionage against Mr Lopez and colleagues who
followed him from General Motors in March. But criminal investigations are
still continuing in both Germany and the US into the alleged disappearance
of data from GM and Adam Opel. The German investigators' findings are not
due until spring, when, in the event of more unsavoury disclosures or even
charges, the VW supervisory board could face a decision far more difficult
than that of approving Mr Piech's medium-term strategy.
In the past few months, Mr Piech made plain his absolute trust in Mr Lopez,
implying that if his Spanish 'soulmate' had to go, the supervisory board
would have to reckon with his departure, too.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Russian miners call off strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the mineworkers in Russia's Arctic core region of Vorkuta last
night called off a threatened strike after talks with the government yielded
further concessions to demands for payment of unpaid wages, extra social
benefits and assurances on the future of the coal industry.
About 30,000 Vorkuta miners had walked out yesterday morning after talks had
broken down. The strike had threatened to spread to pits in the Urals region
and to the largest Russian coal basin, Kuzbass in Siberia.
The strike, the first the miners had mounted since early 1991, when their
support for Mr Boris Yeltsin had helped bring him to power as president of
Russia, had threatened his administration, at a time when the election
campaign for the parliament is nearing its climax and the president is
trying to drum up support for a draft constitution.
The miners had presented over 20 demands; one was that the government under
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, be restructured.
Vorkuta has been the centre of the strike movement - in part because its
highly paid mineworkers have received no pay for three months, and in part
because a government closure programme threatens a third of its high-cost
pits.
However, the movement threatened to spread because of claims by miners'
leaders that government promises to improve conditions were unfulfilled and
because greatly-raised rail tariffs for the carriage of coal had threatened
many mines.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Petrochemicals criteria listed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conditions required for Europe's troubled petrochemicals industry to
restructure were set out yesterday by Mr Carol van Miert, European
competition commissioner.
The Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe (APPE) is due to meet
on December 17 to discuss possible rationalisation of Europe's production of
ethylene, the basic building block of plastics.
Mr van Miert said facts rather than arguments would be the key to the
Commission's assessment. Writing in European Chemical News, he listed five
criteria that needed to be met before the Commission would approve the plan.
The participating companies would have to convince the Commission that:
the situation facing the industry was not merely a dip in the business
cycle, but rather a true structural crisis.
there was no reasonable hope for recovery as long as outmoded structures had
not been adapted to prevailing new requirements of the business.
the crisis affected the entire sector and the proposed solution involved all
players. This would avoid allowing some to secure competitive advantage to
the detriment of others.
the scheme would not have the effect of putting off required
rationalisation; and the crisis was not being used by less competitive
companies to avoid doing something about their own inefficiency.
Mr van Miert also warned: 'I should be very glad to believe the era of major
(anti-competitive) arrangements is now over; but if that is not the case,
the Commission will not hesitate to take appropriate action.'
The APPE is proposing to set up an industry fund worth about DM550m to help
close capacity.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Italy's former communists win the day with tactical strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Achille Occhetto could well afford to smile and indulge in superlatives
as he watched the performance on Sunday night of his Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS) in local elections. In Sunday's second round of voting, the PDS
was confirmed as the one party with a solid national base, capable of
moulding electoral alliances up and down the country. The PDS-dominated
alliances made a clean sweep of the five major cities where polling took
place - Genoa, Naples, Rome, Trieste and Venice. In the 129 towns with over
15,000 inhabitants the PDS and its allies captured 53 administrations.
'It is an extraordinary result,' said the 57-year-old politician who was
instrumental in winding up the old Italian Communist party (PCI) and
founding the social democrat-based PDS. 'This is the triumph of a strategy
(of alliances), not just for the PDS but for all progressive forces.'
Mr Occhetto has convincingly demonstrated a party need not obtain the most
votes to be influential. Organisation and an ability to form a consensus
round a local candidate and programme are just as important.
Under the new system for local elections, approved in March, Italy switched
to directly electing mayors in a first-past-the post system with a second
round run-off in the absence of an absolute majority. Curiously parliament
rejected the French-style run-off in the majority vote system agreed in
August for general elections.
Nevertheless, both new systems encourage a polarisation of the electorate -
at least towards two blocks or coalitions. This polarisation has now begun,
even if political formations are far from complete.
As a result of Sunday's local elections and the November 21 first round, the
PDS has clearly staked a claim to be the central force in a broad leftist
alliance to fight the next general elections, likely before the end of
March. With this head start, it must seem at this stage to be the most
likely nucleus of a future government.
The PDS gained the single largest number of votes in very few of the
weekend's local elections, which affected 428 councils. However, it was the
best organised, and the most capable of finding mayorial candidates that
enjoyed a consensus among potential PDS allies.
Only one of the mayoral candidates in the five big cities was a formal PDS
member, Mr Antonio Bassolino in Naples. The others were independents
sympathetic to the party (Mr Adriano Sansa in Genova, Mr Riccardo Illy in
Trieste and Mr Massimo Cacciari in Venice) or members of other parties - as
with Mr Francesco Rutelli, the Green mayor of Rome.
The PDS used strategic alliances in last June's local elections, when the
new electoral laws were first tested. But the need for alliances appeared
less necessary at that time. Most commentators and politicians believed the
future political geography of Italy would be, in broad terms, a north
controlled by the populist League of Mr Umberto Bossi, the centre dominated
by the PDS and the south a fiefdom of the long ruling Christian Democrats.
The latest local elections witnessed the collapse of the Christian Democrat
vote and of their long ruling allies, the Socialists, Social Democrats and
Liberals. Their supporters, long labled the centrist vote, moved in broad
blocks, either towards the PDS and its allies on the left, or to the League
and to the neo-fascist MSI on the right.
Both the League in the north, and the neo-fascist MSI in the centre and
south have now demonstrated they can obtain up to a third of the vote on
their own. But without alliances this will only lead to local power. Mr
Bossi could well have won Genoa, Trieste and Venice if the League had not
stood alone. In his first comments yesterday, Mr Bossi recognised that if he
was to become a true national political figure he had to search actively for
allies.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, seems convinced he can arrange a
marriage with Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader now emerging as a
principal contender to mop up the centrist vote.
The two are improbable bedfellows but they might be able to make a marriage
of necessity - Mr Bossi needs to forge allies south of the River Po and Mr
Segni would be enormously strengthened by the League's support in the north.
As for the MSI, the movement has performed better than even its wildest
expectations of a month ago. Mr Gianfranco Fini, its 41-year-old leader,
provided an exceptionally strong challenge for mayor of Rome. Although
neither he nor his Neopolitan colleague, Ms Alessandra Mussolini, managed to
wrest control of Rome and Naples, the MSI has become a big player as a
result of the collapse of the Christian Democrats and Socialists.
If Mr Fini can soften the movement's image and remove its fascist overtones,
the MSI could attract permanently many disillusioned Christian Democrat
voters. For the moment these are on loan.

The chairmen of seven big European steel companies yesterday criticised the
European Commission sharply for the lack of progress in its year-long
efforts to restructure the industry by reducing overcapacity and ending
state subsidies.
In an outspoken open letter to their own industry ministers, steel leaders
in six northern European countries - Germany, Britain, France, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg - launched a bitter attack on recent
proposals to end the subsidies deadlock.
'There appears to be pressure to come to a 'solution' at any price,
resulting in compromises which, regrettably, seem only to express a clear
wish to get rid of a politically difficult issue,' they said.
By supporting such compromises, Brussels would halt the momentum towards
restructuring that it had itself endorsed by accepting the need to cut about
10m tonnes of hot rolling capacity in flat products.
'Unfortunately, the Commission, which is responsible for a strict
application of the state aids code, seems to be showing a reluctance to
apply it to those member states unwilling to abide by European law,' said
the letter.
Its tone underlines the private steel producers' exasperation, and echoes
the UK's 'no deal is better than a bad deal' stance at last month's industry
ministers' meeting.
That meeting broke up after Italy rejected a Commission compromise on cuts
in subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the state steelmaker. Yesterday,
however, Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said he was close to
solving the Ilva dispute.
The letter from the steel industry complained that, in spite of lengthy
talks the result achieved by the Commission in the flat products sector was
'totally inadequate'.
With the exception of the Ansio strip mill in Spain, no large flat products
mill would be closed, and the creation of new capacity at Ekostahl, the
struggling east German producer, could not be justified.
In other areas, such as special long products, where subsidised producers
were present, 'only small facilities seem to be facing closure while heavy
loss-making, state-supported facilities continue to produce under the
protection of a restructuring proposal'.
The letters are signed by Mr Gerhard Cromme of Krupp-Hoesch, Mr Ernst Pieper
of Preussag, Mr Brian Moffat of British Steel, Mr Francis Mer of
Usinor-Sacilor, Mr Maarten van Veen at Hoogovens, Mr Joseph Kinsch at Arbed
and Mr Jean Gandois at Cockerill-Sambre.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Mer said 'industry members have been seeking to reduce
production to support prices, while European governments have been acting
irresponsibly'. He described the current situation in the industry as 'dire'
and said next year was likely to be as bad.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Kohl's party third in state poll
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats last night fell behind the
former communists, into third place, in Brandenburg's local government
elections.
The final result of the elections, the first council polls in any east
German state since unification, are considered a barometer for the marathon
round of local and state elections that will culminate in the federal
elections next October.
The party that gained the most from a 59 per cent turnout - which clearly
reflected disillusionment with the established political parties and
particularly with Mr Kohl's gov erning coalition, led by the CDU - was the
Party of Democratic Socialism.
The PDS, successor to east Germany's former communist party, gained 21.23
per cent of the votes, 10 percentage points more than in the December 1990
federal elections in Brandenburg. The SDP which governs Brandenburg
increased its share by 2 points to 34 per cent, and the CDU saw its share of
the vote fall nearly 14 points to 20.4 per cent. The Free Democrats, junior
partner in Mr Kohl's coalition, ended with 7.1 per cent, two points below
the federal election but better than expected.
The PDS is even in a strong enough position to clinch Potsdam, the state
capital, in the run-off. Mr Rolf Kutznutz, a one-time self-declared informer
for the Stasi, or former east German secret police, obtained 43.5 per cent,
leading Mr Horst Gramlich, the SPD incumbent, with 30 per cent.
Also curious is that the greatest support - so far - has been for an
independent candidate. Mr Wolfgang Pohl was elected mayor on first count for
Frankfurt/Oder, one of the four most important cities in Brandenburg, after
receiving 61 per cent of the counted votes.
Dozens of towns and villages in Brandenburg will vote in a second round of
local government elections on December 19, after many candidates failed to
secure a majority, or because of irregularities. However, officials from the
SDP and the CDU yesterday said that would not significantly affect the
outcome of yesterday's final count.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, French economy minister, yesterday announced new loan
guarantees for the country's struggling small businesses and urged
commercial banks to follow the central bank in cutting the cost of credit.
The government is to give CEPME, a body specialising in equipment financing
for small companies, a FFr200m (Pounds 23m) loan guarantee fund, which will
allow it to advance companies with less than 500 employees advances on the
unpaid bills due from local authorities. The minister also said he was
considering 'recapitalising' the CEPME which has been pushed into deepening
losses by mounting bankruptcies of its client companies this year.
This follows a government move earlier this year to use public money to take
half the risk of medium term bank loans to small businesses, and is all part
of an effort to make the big commercial banks less nervous in lending to
small companies on which recession has taken a disproportionate toll.
But Mr Alphandery also suggested commercial banks should lower their bank
rate, currently at 8.15 per cent, after the Bank of France cut its floor
intervention rate by a quarter point to 6.2 per cent last week. 'We very
soon ought to see the bank rate below 8 per cent,' he said.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Givenchy furniture sets record: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A collection of 97 lots of French furniture and works of art, assembled over
30 years by the French couturier Hubert de Givenchy, sold for FFr155.5m
(Pounds 17.67m) at Christie's in Monaco at the weekend This was far in
excess of the FFr100m estimate, and set a record for a single owner auction
of furniture.
The highlight was a 52kg silver chandelier made in 1736 by German goldsmith
Behrens to a William Kent design for King George II's palace in Hanover. It
was bought by the Middle Eastern collector, Al Tajir for FFr19.98m, an
auction record for any item of silver.
The chandelier is one of five which once hung in the Queen's Drawing Room
and Ballroom at Windsor Castle.
The other exceptional price was the FFr18.87m paid for a bureau plat (table)
by the celebrated 17th century furniture-maker Boulle. The bureau plat is
made of ebony, brass and ormolu, and set a record for a Boulle item. It was
the second highest price ever paid for French furniture at auction. In all,
78 lots found buyers.
The furniture had been displayed in Mr de Givenchy's Paris house in the
heart of the fashionable Fauborg St Germain. Now 66 he has moved to a
smaller home. The sale covered a selection of what remains one of the finest
antique collections in France.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Markus Wolf, the former east German spymaster, holds a bouquet of red roses
as he enters a Dusseldorf court yesterday. Wolf, long known as 'the man
without a face' was sentenced to six years in prison for treason and bribery
during the cold war, Ariane Genillard writes from Bonn.
The verdict was booed by his supporters and members of the Party of
Democratic Socialism (PDS), who saw the trial as a show of force by the west
German justice against former east German agents.
The sentence brings to a close a controversial seven-month trial which has
called into question the validity of bringing to justice former east German
spies. Doubts remain among legal experts about whether Wolf could be charged
with treason against a country of which he was not a citizen - West Germany.
Lawyers for Wolf, who is on DM250,000 (Pounds 100,000) bail, said they would
appeal against the decision. He will remain free anyway until the
constitutional court in Karlsruhe issues a verdict on the appeal of Mr
Werner Grossman, his successor, after a Berlin court refused to send him to
prison.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Commission to challenge shipping pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is about to lodge detailed objections to a powerful
agreement among shipping lines operating between Europe and north America.
At its meeting tomorrow, the Commission is likely to approve a 'statement of
objections' to the Trans-Atlantic Agreement, opening the next phase of an
investigation into the accord, which was signed by 15 large shipowners last
year in an attempt to fight overcapacity and cut losses.
Big European Union exporters claim that the TAA is an illegal cartel through
which shipowners have imposed 'exorbitant' rate increases for 1993 on
exports to the US.
The 15 signatories - including P&amp;O Containers of the UK, Hapag-Lloyd of
Germany and Maersk of Denmark - say the agreement is a legal 'conference' of
shipping lines, exempt from European competition rules.
Shipowners will be asked to respond to the Commission's objections. If
Brussels concludes that the TAA is illegally fixing unfair prices, it could
impose heavy fines on the participants, as it did last year on two cartels
operating between Europe and Africa.
Last week, EU exporters claimed to have seen off an attempt by the
shipowners to ease the anti-trust rules on shipping cartels.
Union transport ministers agreed to withdraw a draft resolution on the
competition rules for maritime transport after the Commission promised to
report on the scope of its regulations by the middle of next year. Exporters
claimed the resolution was the work of the shipowners, trying to bully the
Commission into clearing the TAA.
The shipowners want Brussels to clarify the legal situation, particularly as
it relates to new door-to-door container services. They claim they cannot
make ends meet without the help of agreements like the TAA.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Chechens find life chilly outside the bear's embrace:
'Independence' has benefited few
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GROZNY, CHECHNYA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chechnya, on Russia's southern fringes will be the only region to boycott
next weekend's parliamentary elections. It is a gesture of defiance, which,
according to one local newspaper, will mean it 'automatically falls out' of
the Russian Federation. The region declared its independence in 1991, but
has gone unrecognised.
'It is useless to try to intimidate us. We can be good friends but very bad
enemies,' says Chechnya's leader, General Dzhokhar Dudayev, recalling
Chechens' past as indomitable warriors until their conquest by imperial
Russia in the last century.
All that the region's defiance has achieved so far is a painful economic
blockade by Moscow.
Chechens have a history of grievances against Moscow, the most serious of
which was the deportation in 1944 of most able-bodied men from their
homeland to central Asia, by Stalin, for alleged collaboration with the
Nazis. They were allowed to return home only 13 years later.
But Chechnya's 1m inhabitants are now finding their enthusiasm for
independence difficult to sustain when heating in many homes has been
switched off, pensions and state sector salaries have remained unpaid for
months, and crime is rife.
Having been promised that independent Chechnya, with its oil wealth, would
become a new Kuwait, they see that only a minority have got rich trading
everything from stolen Mercedes 600s to oil products from Grozny's
refineries.
President Dudayev, a flamboyant mustachioed former Soviet air force
commander, skirts around the problems, however. Claiming he has got things
under control, he hastens to explain away the gunshot that rings out during
an interview as 'a wedding'. He blames western and Russian pressure for the
fact that not even 'brotherly Moslem states' such as Iraq and Turkey, have
recognised his 'republic'.
But Mr Hamzat Salaam, imam of Grozny's central mosque and one of the few
opposition figures left in Grozny after the suppression of anti-government
demonstrations this summer, dismisses both Mr Dudayev's threats and his talk
of setting up an Islamic state.
'Nobody will go and fight. . . . our ancestors fought for their land and
their religion. But what will people fight for today?'
Although officially Sunni Moslems, most Chechens pay only lip-service to
Islam, which was officially discouraged during seven decades of communism.
What they do genuinely embrace is a fondness for weapons and a long-standing
tradition of blood-vengeance - avenging a life for a life.
Rather than any fears of Mr Dudayev declaring a holy war, the fact that so
many Chechens now own weapons is enough to explain Russia's reluctance to
use force to regain control of its 89th province.
When Mr Yeltsin tried to crush the first stirrings of independence by
declaring emergency rule over Chechnya two years ago, his order was
rescinded two days later and all Russian troops were withdrawn from the area
overnight.
But if all else fails, a now more confident Moscow may be prepared to try
military force once more. Gen Dudayev has been invited to join other
Caucasian leaders for talks with Mr Yeltsin in Nalchik today, but is
unlikely to attend.
Meanwhile, aware of the dangers of sagging support at home, the Chechen
authorities are trying to restore morale by 'activising' law enforcement and
paying the pensions and salaries halted by Moscow's suspension of subsidies
and cash deliveries.
Colonel Saipudin Hassanov, the deputy interior minister, says that officials
who sold off 'tens of thousands of tonnes' of state-owned oil for personal
profit have been sacked. He also says police, who went unpaid for several
months, now plan to tighten up on the proliferation of weapons.
However, his assurances seem less convincing than those of a beady-eyed arms
trader, who, toying with a Makarov pistol during a street-side interview,
declares: 'The police won't touch us.'
Recognising the scale of the law and order challenge, Col Hassanov replies:
'Our people are used to having order imposed on them under totalitarian
rule. But they don't understand that it is much better for us to restore
order ourselves than to have somebody from outside do it'  - an unmistakable
reference to Russia.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Halifax cuts rate but warns on savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, yesterday announced a cut in its
base mortgage rate by 0.35 of a percentage point to 7.64 per cent.
It did not say, however, what its new savings rates would be and issued a
warning that further mortgage rate reductions might be limited if the
government offered savings rates out of line with the market.
The cut follows the 0.5 point cut in base rates a week before the Budget. It
reflects the relief among mortgage lenders that the Budget eroded rather
than abolished mortgage tax relief, in a way which was seen as unlikely to
damage the housing market.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, swiftly followed the
Halifax move and similarly cut its mortgage rate by 0.35 per cent from 7.99
per cent. Other mortgage lenders are expected to announce rate reductions
later this week.
Societies have faced fierce competition this year both for mortgages, where
banks' fixed rates have proved popular, and for savings, where investors
have been attracted by other forms, such as unit trusts.
Yesterday's reductions mean a drop in payments of Pounds 11.75 a month for a
Pounds 60,000 repayment mortgage. They will apply to new borrowers
immediately, and to existing borrowers from January.
Announcing the cut, Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, signalled
that if the government made National Savings products too attractive to
investors, then it could face a dispute with the societies, which have to
rely largely on retail funds from individual savers.
'For investors, we are conscious of the impact of falling rates and
concerned at the prospect of subsidised National Savings competition, which
might limit future mortgage rate cuts,' Mr Blackburn said.
This would not be the first clash between societies and the government over
savings rates. Last year, Mr Andrew Long-hurst, chief executive of
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, led the assault that culminated in the government's
withdrawal of the National Savings First Option bond temporarily.
Societies have been particularly concerned at the Budget announcement of a
guaranteed income bond for people over the age of 65. Details are to be
announced early next year.

FT  07 DEC 93 / French demands threaten trade pact: Last-minute conditions
jeopardise Gatt deadline - EU and US agree farm deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France raised the stakes in world trade talks last night by making a
settlement conditional on a list of demands which risk jeopardising
prospects of meeting the deadline for a deal, just eight days away.
The French gambit came as senior US and EU trade negotiators in Brussels
struggled to break the deadlock over US demands for access to Europe's film
and broadcasting sector and over aircraft subsidies, the last remaining
obstacles to a wide-ranging market access package, including agriculture.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, appealed for calm. 'This is not a
war,' he said, 'but the conditions for an agreement are not there.'
The impasse forced Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, and Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, to delay plans to fly to Geneva to
press the multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations
to a successful conclusion by December 15. They hope to arrive today. Mr
Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, urged the US and EU to wrap up the
market access package. 'No further delay is acceptable,' he said.
France's demands include tougher EU trade weapons, a call for 'cultural
exemption' for its film and TV industry, and a guarantee that French farmers
will not have to take any more land out of production. Without satisfaction
on all issues, there would be no deal, said Mr Juppe.
The all-day negotiating session between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor was marked by
hard bargaining and high drama. At one point last night, Sir Leon summoned
three French ministers, including Mr Juppe, from a Brussels restaurant in an
effort to resolve the audio-visual stand-off.
The hard line risks pitting France against Germany. Bonn has hitherto
resisted making it easier for the European Commission to take anti-dumping
measures and action against unfair traders. Furthermore, inefficient German
farmers stand to lose if the price of Gatt food export cuts is lower EU farm
prices.
The French demands were set out in a letter from Mr Edouard Balladur, prime
minister, to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr Jacques Delors, president
of the European Commission, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of
Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency.
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, German economics minister, said French demands were the
price exacted for a future Gatt deal. 'I think it goes too far,' he said.
British officials objected to the explicit French linkage between a Gatt
deal and internal divisions within Europe on trade policy. 'It creates a
potential problem,' one said.
France's demands revived calls for similar compensation from other EU member
states at a parallel meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels. The
meeting will resume today to review a Brittan-Kantor deal.
Portugal insisted that US offers on textiles were unacceptable. Dutch and
Danish officials warned that billions of Ecus would be needed to 'buy off'
countries objecting to Gatt. 'The atmosphere is disastrous,' said a senior
Greek official. Spanish ministers said, however, that an EU-US deal was
'virtually nailed down' and that the problems were now 'internal'.
Brussels officials said these would be addressed in a series of talks,
starting with an 8am meeting today of the Commission, a second EU foreign
ministers' meeting, and a possible end-game discussion at the EU summit in
Brussels, starting on Friday.
The EU-US farm pact agreed in Brussels yesterday does meet several previous
French demands. The planned 21 per cent cuts in subsidised food exports
shifts from production reference years set in 1986-90 to 1991-92, when
output was higher.
The cuts will thus bite more slowly early on. The EU will be able to export
an extra 8m tonnes of cereals and 350,000 tonnes of beef over the six years.
The US has agreed not to question the CAP regime under a 'peace clause' now
extended from six to either eight or 10 years.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Granada breaks ground with hostile LWT bid: Takeover offer
is rejected as shake-up of ITV intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada launched the first hostile takeover bid in British commercial
television history that stands a chance of success with an offer for London
Weekend Television yesterday.
The bid, which values LWT at roughly Pounds 600m, was firmly rejected by Sir
Christopher Bland, its chairman.
It is further evidence of a fundamental realignment in the ITV system
following the government's decision last week to overhaul licensing rules.
If parliament approves the proposals, any ITV group will be allowed to own
two licences, however large the companies' revenues.
Previous bids for ITV companies were blocked by the old Independent
Broadcasting Authority.
If the Granada-LWT deal were to go through after last week's agreed takeover
by Carlton Communications of Central, the Midlands ITV company, the two
companies would control more than half ITV's Pounds 1.4bn-a-year advertising
revenues.
Mr Gerry Robinson, the chief executive of Granada, which broadcasts to the
north-west of England, offered six new Granada shares for every five LWT
shares, valuing LWT shares at 582p at yesterday's close, with a cash
alternative of 528p a share.
Unusually, the price offered by Granada, which also has interests in leisure
and business services, was at a discount of 0.5 per cent to the LWT share
price of 585p on December 3, the last dealing day before the bid's
announcement. Granada's shares closed 5p down at 485p and LWT's down 1p at
582p.
Mr Robinson emphasised that the offer represented a 54.8 per cent premium on
the LWT share price on June 28 when Granada first bought a stake in the
company, which broadcasts to the London region at the weekend. The holding
now stands at 17.5 per cent.
The deal was 'a full and fair' valuation for LWT, he said. It would create a
combined company accounting for about 22 per cent of total ITV advertising
revenue and reaching 16m viewers at least some time during the week.
The Granada offer was accompanied by an announcement of the group's results
for the year to October 2 showing a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 176m on a turnover of Pounds 1.6bn. All divisions showed increases
in operating profits, with television up 30 per cent to Pounds 43m and a 56
per cent rise in earnings per share to 24.8p.
Granada, famous for programmes such as Coronation Street and more recent
drama hits such as Cracker and Prime Suspect, also promised cost savings
from rationalising the administration and support services of the new
company.
Granada's northern production centre in Manchester, Mr Robinson said, was
custom-built for drama series while LWT studios were ideal for light
entertainment production.
Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, believed Granada
would have to offer between 25p and 30p a share more for LWT. Sir
Christopher should then 'roll over' and accept the inevitable, he said.
It is far from clear if Sir Christopher and his management team, which
collectively own 10 per cent of the company, or shares worth Pounds 60m,
would give in at such a price.
LWT rejects suggestions from Granada that it is too small and marginalised
in the new world of commercial television by arguing that Granada, 'a
conglomerate with only 20 per cent of its operating profit derived from
television', had little to offer LWT shareholders.
LWT believes that, with its stakes in other television companies, it can
stand alone. Apart from 14 per cent of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the company has
a 20 per cent stake in the loss-making GMTV, the commercial breakfast
broadcaster, and 18 per cent in the profit-making Independent Television
News.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Russian banks closed today in protest at wave of killings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Leading Russian commercial banks will close for part, or all, of today in
protest against the murder of a senior banker, the latest in a wave of
killings of businessmen in Russia.
Mr Nikolai Likhachev, the 54-year-old chairman of Rosselkhozbank, which
finances most of Russian agriculture, was shot in the head on Friday night
in front of his home. His killer, as in the murder of 12 other bankers this
year, has not been found.
The murders are usually blamed on extortion gangs, or disputes between
semi-criminal businessmen, or on rows between banks and clients in a country
which has few tools for assessing banking risks and solving commercial
disputes.
'Some borrowers prefer to pay Dollars 5,000 to a hired gunman than to repay
a billion rouble bank loan,' said Mr Vladimir Okhlopkov, chairman of
Delovaya Rossiya Bank.
Some Russian banks are set up by criminals for money-laundering and fraud,
while the authorities are seen as weak, corrupt, and unable to either
supervise or protect the banking sector.
Mr Andrei Makarov, a lawyer who used to head the government's
anti-corruption commission, said the inability of police to solve a single
murder was partly due to their feeling that businessmen deserved what they
got because private enterprise was basically a criminal activity.
'After seven decades of Communism, which taught class hatred of the
bourgeoisie, there is a lot of resentment against the small minority of the
population which is now really rich,' said Mr Okhlopkov. 'We have
practically no middle class and lots of people who feel hard done by.'
Some Russian banks have private armies and dozens of bodyguards to protect
their top executives. But colleagues said that Mr Likhachev, a former deputy
chairman of the central bank, had no bodyguard. His murder was seen as
particularly shocking because of Rosselkhozbank's reputation as a
conservative bastion of the state-owned economy.
Commersant newspaper, however, speculated that one source of resentment
against Rosselkhozbank was the recent elimination of subsidised farm
agricultural loans, which had overnight increased the financial difficulties
of many of the bank's clients.
Rosselkhozbank is mostly owned by state-owned enterprises such as the
country's biggest exporter of mineral fertilisers, with around 10 per cent
of its shares held directly by the state. The government recently announced
plans to sell off the remaining shares it still holds directly in
institutions such as Rosselkhozbank.
The Association of Russian Commercial Banks said it had asked all the
country's banks, of which there are more than 2,000, not to open today. Such
a protest would express their anger at the 'inactivity of law enforcement
agencies' and 'demonstrate to the criminal world their determination not to
leave unpunished a single attack on any bank employee'.
Incombank, whose St Petersburg branch chief was killed last July, said it
would remain closed all day. Another leading commercial bank, Mosbiznesbank,
said it would close for an hour during the funeral service.

FT  07 DEC 93 / France raises stakes in Gatt talks: Conditions for
settlement reduce impact of likely goods and services breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
France raised the stakes in the Gatt world trade talks last night by making
a settlement conditional on demands that may jeopardise the Uruguay Round
deadline, eight days away.
The French gambit overshadowed the successful completion of a deal between
the European Union and the US on agriculture, and reduced the likely impact
of an expected breakthrough in market access for goods and services.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, added to the pressure on his
European counterparts, meeting in Brussels, by saying he could not accept
what he had heard so far of a US-EU trade deal. 'I see no reason for there
to be a trade deal - on the contrary,' he said last night.
German and British officials at the foreign ministers' meeting expressed
concern that fresh uncertainty at this late stage might upset plans to use
the EU-US accords to conclude the multilateral Gatt negotiations in Geneva.
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, German economics minister, said extra French demands,
including improved EU trade defence mechanisms, were the price France was
asking for a Gatt deal. 'I think it goes too far,' he said. 'We do not share
many of the points of view of the French position.'
The Paris government's demands were set out in a letter from Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, to Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency.
Mr Balladur's intervention came on the eve of yesterday's talks in Brussels
between Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative. Both had earlier set the goal of achieving
a framework deal on all outstanding issues that the EU was to review at a
session likely to continue through the night.
Negotiations proved tougher than expected. EU officials said Mr Kantor was
having to consult President Bill Clinton in Washington to clear the final
hurdles, while Sir Leon was having to keep an eye on his Commission
colleagues and the 12 foreign ministers in conclave in the nearby Council of
Ministers.
Mr Rexrodt said the French demands called for strengthened European trade
weapons, including faster anti-dumping procedures; a reform of voting rules
to make it easier for the Commission to take action against unfair trading
practices; and a new instrument for opening markets on the lines of the US
Section 301 trade legislation. 'They want a policy of deterrence,' he said.
Other French demands include more generous market access for textiles;
safeguards for protecting European television and broadcasting; and a new
guarantee on levels of agricultural production which goes beyond yesterday's
US concessions on the Blair House pact limiting subsidised food exports.
France wants a guarantee that farmers will not have to take more land out of
production than envisaged under the reform of the EU's Common Agricultural
Policy, in order to meet the Gatt targets.
That means that if the CAP restraints on production and price cuts fail to
bring European prices to world market levels by about 1996, Paris wants a
commitment that prices will be dropped further so that other EU countries,
and not France's comparatively efficient farmers, will have take more land
out of production.
German officials raised objections because Bonn has traditionally relied on
high support prices to protect its farmers.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Bosnia's warring parties face second hard winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bosnia's three warring parties are poised to fight a second winter of war
with all sides firm in the belief that time is on their side, despite
evidence to the contrary.
Moslem leaders are hoping that United Nations sanctions, imposed on Belgrade
19 months ago, will bite even harder in the coming months, forcing the
Bosnian Serbs to make concessions.
In contrast Serb leaders hold faith that when Greece takes over the European
Union presidency in January, sanctions will be lifted whether or not Serbia
has handed over land to the mostly Moslem state.
For their part, Croats plan to recover some of the territory in central
Bosnia seized by their Moslem rivals over the past months.
With no tangible signs of a settlement, the international community can only
hope that economic deprivation will curb the territorial ambitions of Serb
and Croat nationalists and force them to show flexibility.
But this is a faint hope. At last week's Geneva talks on the division of
Bosnia into three ethnically based republics Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders
gained no ground towards ending the 20-month Bosnian conflict.
Serb leaders ignored EU demands to hand over 3 to 4 per cent of territory to
the mostly Moslem republic in exchange for the easing of sanctions on
Serb-led Yugoslavia.
They are loathe to cede any land in eastern Bosnia, because this would be
tantamount to giving up Greater Serbia. The 'state', carved out over the
past three years by Serb forces in Bosnia and Croatia, would be cut in two.
The Bosnian government, on the other hand, is hard-pressed to abandon claims
on eastern Bosnia, which was mostly Moslem before the war.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Risk and Reward: Banks use swaps to counterbalance
asset-sensitivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low interest rates and a steep yield curve have bailed out the US banking
industry in the past two years: but what will happen to bank earnings if
interest rates rise and the curve flattens?
The question has aroused much speculation but few answers - not least
because it is impossible to tell from published data whether banks have used
interest rate swaps and other off-balance sheet instruments to add to or
reduce their interest rate exposure. Now, faced with scepticism over their
sharply-rising use of derivatives, some US regional and 'super-regional'
banks have begun a campaign to ease investors' concerns.
BancOne has led the fight. The notional value of swaps in which it is
involved jumped to Dollars 37bn at end-September from Dollars 21bn at
end-1992, arousing concern and hitting its share price. Given that BancOne
relies on a buoyant share price to further its acquisition strategy, it
wasn't surprising to see chairman Mr John McCoy in New York last week trying
to persuade 200 analysts and others that the bank wasn't speculating on
interest rates.
Other banks have also been working hard to reduce what they believe are
market misconceptions, among them North Carolina-based First Union. Its use
of instruments like swaptions and floors creates more nervousness than
BancOne.
Information from these two institutions suggests that, while earnings would
normally benefit from a rise in short-term interest rates, they have used
swaps to reverse that position. In effect, the banks are betting that
short-term rates will remain flat or fall further in the next year or so.
Most bank customers want to borrow against the (variable) prime rate and
deposit at fixed rates, says Mr Richard Lodge, BancOne's chief investment
officer: as a result, as interest rates rise, the income a bank receives on
its assets goes up faster than the payments it makes to depositors.
Both BancOne and First Union have used swaps to counterbalance this
so-called 'asset-sensitivity' and tilt their exposure slightly the other way
instead. They do this by entering swap agreements under which they receive a
fixed interest rate and pay a floating one.
BancOne says its use of swaps contributed 70 basis points to its net
interest margin during the third quarter, which stood at 6.22 per cent.
First Union, on the other hand, pursues a hedging strategy which in part
reduces its current net interest margin at the expense of protecting future
earnings. It bought a large option on a swap (known as a 'swaption') a year
ago: this gives it the right to enter a swap agreement at a predetermined
rate. Up-front premiums paid on deals like this are spread over the option's
life, reducing current earnings.
On the face of it, the two banks appear to have remarkably similar exposures
to interest rate movements, though different methods of calculation make
direct comparison difficult. BancOne says a gradual 100 basis point rise in
interest rates during next year would lower earnings by only 3.3 per cent.
First Union puts its interest-rate sensitivity at 3 per cent.
What happens if the yield curve flattens, eating into the banks'
margin-boosting trick of carrying bonds and swaps which pay fixed rates?
'They can't hedge that away,' says Mr John Leonard, an analyst at Salomon
Brothers. But a flatter yield curve could bring higher loan demand - and
then the banks could get back to a business the stock market believes they
know much more about.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Emerging Markets: Staking a claim in China - The Emerging
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So you want to invest in China? Many people do. Foreign companies have
signed direct investment contracts worth more than Dollars 100bn (Pounds
67bn) this year alone - though the actual flow of foreign money into joint
ventures in 1993 is probably nearer Dollars 15bn.
Portfolio investors are equally keen to take a stake in a country which may
be the next economic superpower.
Economic growth rates of 13 per cent last year and probably around 12 per
cent this year are hard to ignore. The past few weeks have seen a new surge
of interest from foreigners, with US institutions in particular awakening to
China's potential and ploughing money mainly into Hong Kong.
'All China shares have undergone an enormous re-rating as a consequence of
the new perception that China is no longer Hong Kong's greatest risk, but
its greatest asset and that China may be the world's most promising emerging
market,' writes Mr David Whittall of Baring Securities.
However, Baring and some other firms are cautious at current price levels,
advocating only purchases of Chinese shares listed in either China or Hong
Kong when they are initially offered at lower earnings multiples than are
prevalent in the market.
Though markets are encouraged by recent reform measures in vital areas such
as the financial system and taxation, there is considerable uncertainty
about the success of Beijing's measures to slow the overheated economy.
Although the government has gone a long way towards creating a market
economy, the most difficult measures, such as tackling the public sector,
still lie ahead.
Recent buying was sparked partly by a view that previous price declines
meant that bargains were to be had and that China appeared to be avoiding a
hard landing for the economy.
The comments of Mr Barton Biggs, emerging markets strategist for Morgan
Stanley, who said in September that he was 'maximum bullish' on China,
raised the consciousness of US investors even though the investment bank
later reversed September's increase in its portfolio weightings for China.
Mr Mark Mobius, president of the new Templeton China World Fund, says he
accepted Dollars 288m from investors but could have raised as much as
Dollars 1bn. The fund became the largest of about 40 'China funds' with
total net assets of around Dollars 2bn, of which all but five have sprung up
within the past two years.
The problem facing investors who want to participate in China's growth is
that of several different vehicles available, none is perfect and all are
volatile. Many investors have preferred to go through funds which profess to
invest in China or in equities closely linked to China.
Investing directly on the small and illiquid stock exchanges in Shanghai and
Shenzhen involves a high degree of uncertainty. B shares in which foreigners
are allowed to invest - A shares are for domestic investors - are volatile
and profit performance varies considerably.
When buying is in fashion, the small amount of stock available tends to send
prices rapidly to levels which many analysts regard as overbought. Shanghai
B shares rose 14 per cent during one week in November on average daily
turnover of Dollars 13m - high for that market - and are now trading at an
average of 18 times 1993 earnings, according to Baring Securities.
Investors in B shares have to accept inadequate regulation and corporate
disclosure. Although Chinese companies have come some way towards western
accounting standards the typical manager of a state-owned enterprise has a
pretty hazy concept of profit.
These uncertainties have led fund managers to buy China via foreign markets,
principally Hong Kong. The degree of exposure ranges from a small number of
H shares, Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, to 'red chips', Hong Kong
companies deriving a substantial amount of their income from China, to other
Hong Kong companies with less direct links to the mainland.
Of 36 funds on which Micropal, publisher of the monthly Emerging Market Fund
Monitor, has data, seven have more than 40 per cent of their portfolio
invested in B shares and 20 have more than 40 per cent invested in Hong
Kong. Eight still have more than 40 per cent of their portfolio in cash -
some because their mandate is to seek equity in unlisted Chinese companies,
which takes time and expertise.
Though some managers feel that funds which buy principally in Hong Kong do
not have a portfolio truly representative of China, many believe strongly
that it is the best route.
Mr Mobius, who has invested around 60 per cent of the Templeton China World
Fund in Hong Kong, says: 'I feel comfortable about buying Hong Kong because
it is a reflection of China and you're buying experienced managers and an
accounting system you can understand.'
Mr Robert Lloyd George, who runs a firm managing two China funds, notes that
companies in the Hang Seng Index derive only some 2 per cent of their
profits directly from China. However, the fortunes of smaller listed
companies tend to be much more closely tied up in China, he says. The Lloyd
George Standard Chartered China Fund has shares in about 35 smaller Hong
Kong companies and half a dozen H stocks, as well as B shares.
Fund managers stress, however, that China is a long-term investment which is
likely to see many jolts as well as spurts forward. Investing in China via
Hong Kong may add further volatility because of local factors such as the
Sino-British dispute over the territory's political development.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Equity Markets: Strategists' menus suggest further gains -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After last week's spectacular performance it may seem churlish to ask for
more, but the tone of the London stock market suggests that more is indeed
expected, at least on the menus put together by the equity strategists. Base
rate cuts - the market now prefers the plural version - are more than ever
in prospect for the new year, with or without the encouragement of the
Bundesbank.
The chancellor's commitment to promoting economic recovery has re-focused
attention on the January round of company results; the market has been
through this exercise before, but expectations that recovery will show
itself in corporate profits have to be satisfied soon.
The effects of the Budget speech showed themselves in a number of special
factors last week. Derivatives markets again demonstrated the power over
underlying equities imposed by the impressive liquidity and flexibility of
the futures markets.
'If a fund manager wants to put, say Pounds 50m into UK equities, then the
stock market will be moving against him long before he secures the stock.
But he can put Pounds 50m into the stock index future in half an hour,' said
one futures trader as the December stock index contract raced to premiums of
around 30 points against cash last Wednesday.
The premium dipped at one time but by the close of business on Friday it had
returned to around 29 points against cash - Fair Value, the estimated
premium allowing for dividend and carrying costs, is virtually zero at this
stage of the contract's life. The premium still offers a powerful lead ahead
of its expiry in just over a week, when the contract and the FT-SE 100 Index
must be in line.
However, last week's futures frenzy may not be repeated, since it was also
linked to frantic attempts by a UK investment bank to put into equities
Pounds 100m cash taken in by the new Lloyds investment funds. The stock
market estimates that more than Pounds 500m of these Lloyds funds are
earmarked for UK equities. With the Budget out of the way, there will be
less pressure on fund managers to get the money into the market.
One hurdle still to be faced could be the market's more considered response
to the Budget proposals on Foreign Income Dividends. The stock market has
identified nearly 40 companies, mostly FT-SE listed, which could be serious
FID candidates, although the companies themselves still seem unsure of their
dividend policy. The stock market has been surprisingly slow in taking on
board the implications of the Budget FID plans, perhaps because analysts
have seen them as share-specific rather than significant for the market as a
whole.
The implications of Ladbroke's decision to take advantage of FID rules has
been masked by the many other factors affecting the shares. The same applies
to BP, Lasmo and Rank Organisation, all three spotted by the market as
stocks with a surplus ACT problem. The search for other FID candidates will
no doubt be taken further this week.

Today's French repo tender will be the focus of most market activity as
traders wait to see whether the franc continues its rise following last
Friday's rate cut.
The Bank lowered its intervention rate by 25 basis points to 6.20 per cent,
triggering expectation that the franc would rise further to regain its old
ERM floor and then move up to around FFr3.41 against the D-Mark - its level
before the summer currency crisis.
On Thursday the Bundesbank set off a round of minor interest rate cuts
around Europe by setting its repurchase rate at 6 per cent for an
unprecedentedly-long period of five weeks.
Even though the German central bank left its main Lombard and discount rates
unchanged, this move led to cuts in Belgium, Spain, France and the
Netherlands.
The franc has been strong enough to weather a cut in its rate for some time,
and market observers regarded the easing as a fait accompli after the rate
cuts in other countries. Today's current account for France will be another
bright spot. Imports' bigger fall than exports in 1993 also helped to
underpin the franc. Trade growth is expected to add 0.6 per cent to gross
domestic product this year and next.
European interest rate cuts will help the markets digest whatever comes out
of the Brussels summit on December 10. If Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister, has to give ground on agriculture, then a cut in French interest
rates might ease the pain.
But if the summit sets the scene for a collapse in the trade talks - though
this is looking increasingly unlikely as all have committed themselves to a
successful conclusion - then currencies will undoubtedly be greatly
affected, especially the most heavily-traded.
If the GATT talks go to plan, this will set the tone for a gentle rise in
the dollar. The US recovery seems firmly established with economists
expecting GDP to approach 5 per cent in the fourth quarter. Some expect to
see the dollar at DM1.75 by early in the New Year, aided by lower European
rates.
This week should be something of an anti-climax after the excitements of
last week's Budget, which sent the UK stock market to a new high. The pound
should though derive some support from economic statistics, such as consumer
credit, during the week. An increase of around Pounds 350m in net
outstanding credit is projected, which would be consistent with signs of a
tentative consumer-led recovery.
The trade data, meanwhile, have been confusing given the lack of
comprehensive statistics. Exports appear firm.

<TEXT>
State Street Bank and Trust Company, the US custodian bank, has been granted
a branch banking licence in Australia.
State Street, the largest custody services provider in Australia, is the
third overseas bank to be granted a branch banking licence under the
government's new foreign bank policy, and the first US bank. The government
announced a liberalisation of foreign bank entry in 1992, in an effort to
promote competition in the sector.
Yesterday, Mr George Gear, the government's assistant treasurer, said the
authorisation would allow State Street to provide cash management and
foreign exchange services to custody clients in the Asia-Pacific regions and
to expand the trade finance activities offered to small and medium-sized
businesses.
But its operations will be limited to wholesale banking.
There has been growing demand for custody services - which include the
safe-keeping and administration of share and bond portfolios for
institutional clients - because of the strong growth in Australia's fund
management industry.

FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Holvis-Holzstoff warns of loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Holvis-Holzstoff, the Swiss non-wovens and paper distribution group, said it
could record a net loss this year because severe price erosion in non-wovens
markets was forcing it to make large revaluations of assets.
The group, in which two British institutional investors hold large minority
stakes, also revised its 1993 trading profit forecast down from SFr42m to
about SFr35m (Dollars 23.4m). Last year, its trading profit was SFr47.3m.
Pedro Reiser, Holvis chief executive, at a press conference in Zurich, said
the board would decide when the 1993 results were in whether or not to pay a
dividend. Holvis paid an unchanged SFr11 per share dividend on 1992 results.
Mr Reiser said prices of non-wovens, which are used in nappies, tampons and
a growing number of medical and surgical garments, had slumped about 20 per
cent since 1990.
This was due partly to suppliers expanding capacity in anticipation of rapid
growth, partly to competitors in weak currency countries undercutting prices
and partly to pressure from big customers, such as Procter &amp; Gamble.
Mr Reiser expected prices to continue to weaken in 1994 as competition in
the nappy market intensified.
The group's cash flow would be negative both this year and next because of a
high level of investment to secure its position in the medical and other
high-margin segments of the non-wovens business.
The group said in August it was reassessing the competitiveness of some of
its production units in countries with strong currencies, but expected to
meet any costs from existing reserves. It said yesterday this reassessment
'might lead to extraordinary write-offs'.

FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Liffe sets fresh record for
November trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe)
traded a new monthly record of 10,957,943 futures and options contracts
during November, an increase of 86 per cent over November 1992.
It was the third consecutive record month and represents a 5 per cent rise
on the previous record in October 1993.
The continued volatility in European financial markets in November -
especially in the UK and Italy - led to heavy trading and hedging activity
during that month.
On the French Matif futures and options exchange, trading volume in November
totalled 6,514,508 contracts, an increase of 40 per cent over November 1992.
In November also, some 471,703 Matif contracts were traded on Globex, the
electronic trading system, representing 77 per cent of all Globex volume
that month.

Daewoo, South Korea's fourth-largest business group, is considering
acquiring a 49 per cent stake in Parva Chastna Banka, a Bulgarian bank.
'The proposed deal is part of Daewoo's strategy of helping finance South
Korean investment in eastern Europe by acquiring interests in local
financial institutions,' Daewoo said. It has already bought a stake in a
Hungarian bank and securities firm.
Daewoo has indicated it is interested in investing in Bulgarian hotels,
cement plants and telecommunications.
But the company added that the proposed Bulgarian bank acquisition 'will
take some time to be completed'. It is waiting for an asset valuation of the
bank to determine a price for its share. The deal must also be approved by
the bank's shareholders.

FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Summit fails to resolve CBoT
feud with Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The summit between the major participants in the Globex electronic futures
trading system has made clear that unless the Chicago Board of Trade makes
operational concessions demanded by Reuters, it will be left out of the
Globex system next year.
At the same time Reuters and the joint venture committee that runs Globex
are clearing the obstacles that have kept Liffe, the London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange, from joining the system.
'We are facing the possibility that Globex will go on as a partnership
between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Matif and Liffe, without the Board
of Trade,' said one executive close to the meetings.
Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of the CBoT, and
Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters project manager for Globex, attended the summit.
None of those attending last week's meeting was willing to comment on the
proceedings. But officials said privately that Reuters' patience with the
CBoT had grown thin and, while the company was willing to continue to take
losses on Globex, it wanted participating exchanges to help boost volume on
the system.
Reuters wants the CBoT, the world's busiest futures exchange, to list its
agricultural contracts on Globex, and to list its giant US Treasury bond
futures and options contracts for much longer trading periods.
Reuters is also worried that the CBoT's Project A electronic trading system
will become a direct Globex competitor and wants it abandoned. The CBoT has
resisted these changes.
The 18-month-old Globex recorded turnover of 608,719 contracts in November,
up 88 per cent from 1992. Paris's Matif contributed 78 per cent of that
volume, while CME generated 13 per cent, and the CBoT 9 per cent.
While growing steadily, Globex volume is far below targets, and its
under-performance is expected to result in a major restructuring when
operating contracts reopen this spring.
Reuters, the CME and the CBoT are currently joint venture partners in the
system. Officials expect a reorganised Globex to give equal governance
powers to all participating exchanges, a feature that would lure Liffe, and
other exchanges, on to the system.

FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: EIB lending to reach Ecu19bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Investment Bank said the volume of its borrowing and lending
next year could be adversely affected by slower growth in public sector
infrastructure spending in western Europe.
At a presentation in London, Mr Pit Treumann, a senior EIB official
responsible for lending throughout the European Union, said the bank's
lending and borrowing were 'demand-driven'.
If factors like the move towards privatisation in several countries slowed
down demand for infrastructure financing, this would influence the EIB's
need for funds on capital markets, he said.
The EIB now ranks as the most active international development institution,
with its operations exceeding those of the World Bank.
This year it will sign agreements to lend an overall Ecu19bn, 90 per cent
within the EU, although disbursements are a smaller figure. This compares
with lending commitments of Ecu16bn in 1992.
Because of the uncertainties over the outlook for 1994, the bank has not yet
assessed the likely size of its borrowing and lending operations for next
year, though it is due to draw up a forecast this month.
The bank has borrowed Ecu14bn on different markets so far this year, with
the largest component - around 16 per cent of the total - in sterling.
The scope of the bank's activities has been increased by decisions by
European heads of government for the EIB to step up funding for transport,
telecommunications and energy projects.
Sir Brian Unwin, chairman, said: 'There is certainly a case for extending
the facility' in the light of the recession in much of the continent.
Since the end of 1992, the EIB has been given a remit to provide an extra
Ecu7bn for such projects in addition to its normal lending. Loans of
Ecu3.5bn for the extra projects have been approved with the total expected
to reach Ecu4.5bn by the year end.

FAG Kugelfischer, the German ball-bearing manufacturer, said its
third-quarter operating loss declined 'noticeably'and it expects improvement
to continued in the fourth quarter of the year, Reuter reports from
Frankfurt.
While the company did not give any specific figures, it attributed the
improvement to its restructuring programme.
Group sales for the full year are forecast at around 15 per cent lower than
in 1992, at about DM3bn (Dollars 1.7bn).
The company attributed that drop to the divestiture of some of its
subsidiaries and units.
Kugelfischer said 10,400 jobs had been shed in the first nine months of the
year - a third of the 31,000 workforce at end-1992.  By the year-end, about
half of last year's number will remain, the company said.

<TEXT>
ANZ, the Australian banking group, has won the mandate to arrange loans of
up to Dollars 650m to help finance three large power projects in India.
Rolls-Royce, the British engineering group, last month won contracts
amounting to Pounds 660m (Dollars 983.4m) to build three power plants in
India. These include a coal-fired station in West Bengal, a similar station
in the state of Bihar, and a combined cycle gas fired station in Andhra
Pradesh.
ANZ International Merchant Banking will arrange up to Dollars 650m of
dollar-denominated offshore debt and equity, including funding from export
credit agencies, from multilateral financial institutions, such as the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), and from the commercial banking sector with a
syndication loan.
The remaining finance will probably be raised using a combination of equity
and loans from Indian credit institutions, according to ANZ.

FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: US bank to expand in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, intends to double the size of its
German operations within the next 18 months.
Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley worldwide, said in Frankfurt
the plan was to take the headcount from around 80 at its Frankfurt office to
double that level.
The expansion, which will be across all divisions, is the latest sign of the
increasing attractions of Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial
centre - for the international investment banking community.
The leading international investment houses have in most cases had Frankfurt
offices since the mid-1980s but many institutions are keen to expand.
Goldman Sachs, a late arrival which opened its Frankfurt office only in
1990, has doubled its personnel to 120 since last year.
Mr Fisher said the main reason for the planned expansion was the likelihood
of further globalisation of international capital markets. He predicted that
the German financial world would become more 'Anglo-Saxon' as capital
markets opened up further to international investors.
'The German capital markets will evolve considerably in the next few years,'
Mr Fisher said, 'increasing in liquidity and the diversity of investor
interests.'
The recent decision to site the European central bank in Frankfurt was not a
deciding factor behind the decision, he argued. It merely strengthened the
arguments for stepping up the institution's commitment to Europe's largest
economy.
He denied that the expansion would be at the expense of its London
operations, where the institution employs 1,400 out of a total European
headcount of 1,800 staff. Currently much of the firm's German business - in
areas such as mergers and acquisitions and equity research - is handled out
of London but Mr Fisher was unwilling to be drawn on whether staff would be
transferred out of London to Frankfurt.
Morgan Stanley's German operations are headed by Mr Hans Peter Peters, a
former main-board director of the powerful Westdeutsche Landesbank.
The firm is especially strong in the capital markets area: Mr Peters said
that in the year to date Morgan Stanley had underwritten DM12bn (Dollars
7.1bn) in capital, up from DM4.2bn last year, making the firm the leading
non-German underwriter for D-Mark issues. It has lead managed 83
capital-raising issues in Germany this year, up from 27 last year.
Mr Peters also pointed to successful M&amp;A transactions on which the firm has
advised recently - for example it advised the privately-owned Gustav und
Grete Schickedanz Holding group on the sale of its tissue business to
Procter &amp; Gamble, a deal completed last week with a value estimated at
DM1bn.
Mr Fisher also said the firm would remain true to its commitment to Germany
even if business conditions retreated from current levels.
Foreign investment banks, like their domestic competitors, have prospered
amid buoyant securities markets this year and a perceptible increase in the
willingness of German companies to appoint foreign financial advisers.
In Germany, however, there is a lingering mistrust of foreign institutions'
staying power because many have withdrawn from the market after encountering
severe difficulties.

Rinascente
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), the Bahrain-based financial institution, has
become the second-biggest shareholder in La Rinascente, Italy's leading
retailer, with about 6 per cent of the total capital.
Banque Pictet, a Geneva-based private bank, will also become a big
Rinascente stockholder with about 2 per cent of the total capital as part of
the same transaction.
The two stakes stem fron rights to Rinascente shares not taken up by Ifi and
Ifil, two stock-market quoted holding companies indirectly controlled by the
Agnelli family. Through Ifi, the Agnellis control Fiat, the former owner of
Rinascente.
After a recent complex transfer of control of Rinascente from Fiat, Ifil now
has a controlling 33 per cent stake in Rinascente. Under the terms of that
transaction, Fiat offered its controlling 46.8 per cent stake in Rinascente
to its own shareholders at L9,500 a share.
Under an agreement with the Italian stock exchange authorities, Ifil and
Ifi, its parent company, declined to take up the rights to Rinascente shares
they were entitled to as Fiat shareholders.
Separately, Ifil launched a public tender offer to buy up to 33 per cent of
Rinascente's stock.
Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, said group premiums, rose by 20.5 per
cent in the first nine months of 1993 to L13,740bn (Dollars 8.02bn).
Adjusted for exchange rate changes, the overall increase was 12.4 per cent,
with life insurance premiums climbing by 17.7 per cent, while non-life
premiums increased by 9.3 per cent.
The group gave no profits forecast, but said its claims ratio on its
domestic non-life business had continued to improve, while underwriting
earnings abroad remained under pressure.

Profits at Incentive, the Swedish industrial group controlled by the
Wallenberg family, rose 55 per cent to SKr345m (Dollars 40.9m) in the first
nine months, excluding associated companies.
The company started to feel the full effect of the Swedish krona's
depreciation in the third quarter, after the expiry of hedging programmes,
adding to the benefits of cost-cutting and lower capital costs it was
already experiencing.
The profits improvement would have been greater but for a SKr70m charge for
restructuring within the group's marine unit, Hagglunds.
Market conditions remain disappointing, the company warned, even though
there was a pick-up in the volume of orders in the latter half of the
period.
Sales at SKr8.33bn were down 2 per cent in underlying terms from last year,
because an upturn in the North American and Asian markets was unable to
offset continuing weakness in Europe, particularly in the Nordic region.
Orders rose to SKr9.12bn from SKr8.48bn.
If income from Incentive's stakes in Asea, Electrolux and Esab are included,
profits were up by 34 per cent at SKr1.07bn. The main impact came from Asea,
which lifted its contribution to SKr665m from SKr485m.
The group says its full year result, excluding associated companies, will
exceed last year's SKr371m, with the final quarter expected to show an
improvement on the corresponding 1992 period.

FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Shake-up in Indian mutual funds
 -Foreigners are entering a fast-growing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western companies are breaking into the fast-growing Indian market for
mutual funds.
Investment advisory companies in the UK, the US and in Hong Kong are trying
to take advantage of the Indian government's decision last year to end
state-owned institutions' monopoly of mutual fund management by permitting
competition from private companies, including foreign groups.
In the past few months, 19 private fund management groups have been given
permission by the Securities and Investment Board of India, the market
watchdog, to launch domestic funds.
Last month the first two funds were launched by a joint venture between HC
Kothari, a Madras-based commercial group, and Pioneer Group, a US fund
management company with its head office in Boston. The partners hope to
raise Rs900m for the two funds.
Another three foreign companies are not far behind Kothari and Pioneer.
Creditcapital, the Indian affiliate of Lazard Brothers, the British merchant
bank, is launching a fund in which the European Union has promised to
invest, through its developing countries' aid programme, as has the
International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank.
Kemper, the Chicago-based financial services group, is establishing a fund
management joint venture with 20th Century Finance of Bombay. The
International Finance Corporation plans to invest in this venture also.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, is going it alone setting up a
75-per-cent-owned Indian fund management subsidiary in Bombay.
The authorities expect new companies to shake up an industry dominated by
the Unit Trust of India, a state-controlled giant with 30m accounts and a
market share of 80 per cent. UTI's competition comes from eight funds owned
by state-owned banks, which were cautiously allowed into fund management in
the late 1980s.
Mr Pratip Kar, SEBI's executive director, says private companies are being
admitted into fund management to improve the quality of services for
investors, including more transparent trading practices. Foreign groups
should bring 'better know-how, better standards of compliance with rules and
more advanced forms of automation.'
UTI has responded to the prospect of competition by tying up with Alliance
Capital Partners, a US fund manager, with the intention of jointly launching
an asset management company.
UTI is also investing Rs600m-700m in computers to improve control over its
41 offices and 2,100 employees.
Mr S A Dave, the chairman, says: 'Over the past few years we have expanded
very fast as investors have wanted to invest in a strong stock market. Now,
we have to improve the quality of our services.'
The authorities main aim is an overall improvement in the quality of stock
market investment services for the public. Officials believe unscrupulous
stockbrokers and financial advisers too often see private individuals as an
easy prey. They would like to steer small-scale investors away from direct
investment in shares towards mutual funds.
For example, the minimum size of investment in a stock market new issue has
this year been raised from Rs1,000 to Rs5,000, while the minimum mutual fund
investment has been set at Rs1,000.
But Mr Sudhir Virendra, chief executive of Creditcapital's mutual fund, says
it will take time for private sector funds to develop their reputations.
The 19 groups which have secured official approval may not all actually
launch funds, given the start-up costs. Substantial profits will come only
when fund management groups amass sizeable funds. 'We have to prove
ourselves in the next couple of years,' says Mr Virendra.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Volvo - Collapse of the merger with Renault: Soren Gyll
denies that he betrayed Pehr Gyllenhammar / Hugh Carnegy talks to the man
who recommended that the merger with Renault should be withdrawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the final, dramatic days last week that led to Volvo pulling out of its
controversial plan to merge with France's Renault, Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's
chief executive, was identified as the man who led a 'palace coup' to kill
the deal.
Mr Gyll does not deny his central role in the merger's demise. But he
stiffened with anger yesterday afternoon at the suggestion that he betrayed
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who quit after 22 years as Volvo's leader when
confronted with a demand from senior management that the merger be dropped.
'Absolutely not],' Mr Gyll exclaimed. 'That is complete nonsense. I met him
as we are sitting now and told him exactly what my position was. Is that
betrayal?'
Sitting in a small conference room in Volvo's headquarters outside
Gothenburg, Mr Gyll said that under Swedish corporate law he was under no
obligation to give prior notice to the chairman of the company before making
a recommendation to the board that the merger should be withdrawn, but he
had done so last week.
He said he met Mr Gyllenhammar on Wednesday, the day before the fateful
board meeting, to tell him he (Mr Gyll) had concluded that shareholder
opinion and opinion within Volvo was now against proceeding with the merger.
He had not gone behind Mr Gyllenhammar's back in any way.
'I am really upset, because that is not my way of working,' he said. 'I
didn't betray anybody. I am surprised and also upset because I have tried to
do everything right.
'This is the worst decision I have ever been involved in. It is a serious
one, of course, but I was prepared to take all the responsibility.
'And I am still convinced the decision was right. And remember, the board
took the decision, not me. I just gave the recommendation . . . PG
(Gyllenhammar) took his own decision (to resign).
'I didn't know when I went into the board meeting what the outcome would be.
They could have fired me. That could have been my last board meeting -
that's what I told my wife when I went there. I could have been shooting
myself in the head]'
Mr Gyll said that he had come to realise over last weekend that the chances
of winning shareholder approval for the merger - originally announced in
September - at a special shareholder's meeting on December 7 had all but
disappeared.
At the same time, he was alarmed by growing dissent within Volvo, where
engineers, white collar workers and a number of senior managers were
expressing opposition to going ahead.
Mr Gyll therefore asked a group of senior managers from Volvo's car and
truck divisions to come to his home in Gothenburg last Tuesday evening for
what was to prove the decisive blow to the merger.
'They came on Tuesday night. My only question was what do you think about
the situation we have now. After a couple of hours it was obvious there was
a uniform view that the conditions were not there to make a successful
merger - both with the external reactions, but also the internal situation.
'A lot of people in managerial positions were very doubtful about it. 'The
conclusion I think was that you can't have a successful merger if you don't
have the people with you.'
The next day, some 25 managers signed a letter to Mr Gyll asking him to tell
the board that they wanted the merger scrapped and expressing their full
confidence in him to lead the company thereafter.
But Mr Gyll strongly denies that he either initiated the letter, or that he
presented it to the board.
'The letter to me is not important. I asked for nothing,' he said. 'On the
contrary, on Wednesday when Gyllenhammar came back from a visit to the
States, we met and talked and I said I didn't see the prerequisites for a
successful merger. Then I prepared a memo myself for the board meeting. I
didn't refer to the letter, I didn't present it.'
Despite being irked by the label of coup leader, Mr Gyll was for the most
part in remarkably relaxed mood yesterday. Dressed in a sweater and corduroy
trousers and nursing a cold, he seemed relieved that the tension of the past
weeks was behind him.
Amid the uncertainty and bitterness left behind by the broken merger, Mr
Gyll looks to be unchallenged as the new man in charge of Sweden's biggest
and best-loved industrial concern.
While Volvo's institutional shareholders are mostly glad to see the back of
Mr Gyllenhammar, who rubbed them up the wrong way once too often, they
appear to have full confidence in Mr Gyll.
The irony is that it was Mr Gyllenhammar who brought him in to be Volvo
chief executive early last year from Procordia, the drugs and food group
which Mr Gyll had headed for eight years.
Procordia, previously half owned by the state and Volvo, has been broken in
two. Volvo is taking over all its food operations through a company called
BCP, and retaining a big stake in the other half, Pharmacia.
Mr Gyllenhammar's idea was that Mr Gyll was the man to run the
newly-structured Volvo parent, which in effect was to have become a
diversified industrial investment company.
Meanwhile, Mr Gyllenhammar was to have played the main role from Volvo's
side in what was to have been its 35 per cent investment in a new
Renault-Volvo company.
Now Mr Gyll, a man with no previous experience of the motor industry, is
left in charge of a Volvo which may again focus on its core vehicle making
business.
He must also pick up the pieces with Renault, where he is inevitably
regarded with some suspicion compared with the previous enthusiasm for the
French-speaking Mr Gyllenhammar.
Mr Gyll, who agrees Volvo still requires a long-term partner in the motor
industry, wants to continue a three-year old alliance with Renault.
He says he told Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chief executive, about his
decision to recommend dropping the merger before Thursday's board meeting.
He told him such a decision was preferable either to an outright shareholder
rejection, or a narrow approval that would have been challenged in the
courts. The two will discuss the future of their co-operation early this
week.
'I have to offer them apologies because we haven't delivered what we
promised and I am very sad about that because if you can't deliver on your
promises, that is not good for the future.'
Mr Gyll acknowledges that both sides will need time to 'cool off' before
deciding how to proceed. But he made clear Volvo would like to maintain
initiatives taken under the existing alliance with Renault, such as joint
purchasing and quality organisations.
'Now we are back in the position where we should consider if we can build
the alliance for the future. I mean we could create some joint structure if
we want - with 50 - 50 ownership, for example. It's a question of whether
Renault still has a trust in Volvo, because we know we have failed to
deliver.'
As for Volvo itself, Mr Gyll admits it 'could be' that the long-time
Gyllenhammar strategy of diversification will be altered in favour of a
stronger focus on vehicle manufacture - something most Swedes would applaud.
But he stressed that it is too early to predict what shape the company will
take - except to affirm that 'there will be life after this'.
He rejects the parting judgment of Mr Gyllenhammar that Volvo is now a
'wounded company' as it faces a future with its central strategy shattered
and without the man who was 'Mr Volvo'.
'Of course I feel sad that Pehr decided to leave. He was the reason I came
to Volvo. On the other hand an organisation cannot be built on one man. I am
convinced we have the resources, we have the people. But you have to give us
a little time so that we can fit together.'

FT  06 DEC 93 / Volvo - Collapse of the merger with Renault: French reaffirm
plan to privatise Renault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, yesterday confirmed the
government's commitment to privatise Renault in spite of the failure of the
merger with Volvo. He also expressed optimism about the French state-owned
group's prospects.
'I am confident in the future of Renault which will become a private company
and will win on the markets like it wins on the race track,' he said in an
interview in the Journal du Dimanche,the French Sunday paper.
He said Volvo's rejection of the merger was a mistake and that he could not
understand how the deal had failed after having been agreed by the company's
board.
'I am disconcerted by the management methods of Swedish business,' he said.
'How can a management board be opposed by shareholders who had been informed
for several months of its strategy?'
Mr Longuet said the future of co-operation between the two groups, based on
a far-reaching industrial alliance and extensive cross-shareholdings, would
depend on talks between the two and the direction taken by Volvo's new
management.
'I am not in the front line in this affair. It will be up to the industrial
groups to present new proposals' he said.
But Mr Longuet warned that Volvo would be faced with problems. He said
Swedish industry had received a temporary boost from the effects of currency
devaluation. 'This situation is transitory, and when Volvo is again
confronted by the harsh realities of the market the problems will reappear.'
Mr Longuet rejected criticisms that the French state had played too large a
role in the planned deal. He said the The Swedish people had not understood
that with 35 per cent of the merged group Volvo would have been the
principal shareholder.

FT  06 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier pension warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing and information business, has
announced that tax changes on pension schemes announced in March would
reduce its 1993 operating profits by Pounds 19m.
There would be no cash flow effect on the company's earnings and its
contributions holiday could continue for several more years. However,
because of the SSAP 24 accounting rule for pension expense, a reduction in
the pension scheme surplus would be reflected both in the company's balance
sheet and its profit and loss statement.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief financial officer of Reed Elsevier, said the
reduced profits would be more than offset by a recent slight improvement in
UK and US trading conditions and the pre-tax profit contribution from the
Official Airline Guides acquisition completed in September.
The pensions credit added Pounds 28m to operating profits in 1992 but that
would fall to Pounds 9m for 1993.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours, the holiday group, is expected to announce today that it has
appointed Mr Roger Davies as chairman of its retail division.
Mr Davies, 48, is one of the travel industry's most experienced figures,
having served as chairman of the Thomson Travel Group from 1984 to 1989.
Airtours, which announces full year results today, has recently purchased
the Hogg Robinson and Pickfords travel agents' chains, making it the second
biggest holiday retailer after Lunn Poly, which is owned by Thomson.

FT  06 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ward shares tumble on loss warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ward Holdings fell 8p to 35p on Friday after the housebuilder and
property group revealed that an exceptional provision in the results for the
year to October 31 would force it into the red.
In August the group said that it intended to review the value of its land
bank and property assets at October 31.
The review revealed that for certain residential land there was 'a
substantial surplus over book amount', but that accounting conventions
dictated that this could not be reflected in the figures for the year to
October.
The valuation also revealed that a provision was necessary against the book
value of other residential land and industrial properties. This, along with
other provisions, total Pounds 8.4m.
Ward said that borrowings had continued to be paid down. At October 31 they
were Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 30.6m).

FT  06 DEC 93 / UK Company News: S&amp;P drops launch of high income unit trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubts over the ability of high income unit trusts to offer double-digit
income have been raised by the sudden decision of Save &amp; Prosper to scrap
plans to launch such a trust.
S&amp;P's abandonment of the high income unit trust comes just weeks before its
launch in the New Year and was attributed to a lack of confidence that
investors' capital would be preserved.
Mr Ken Emery, S&amp;P's technical director, said yesterday: 'We have been
running models with dummy portfolios for some time and in the end we were
not confident such a high level of income could be achieved without eroding
capital.'
S&amp;P had been looking at the feasibility of a cocktail of financial products
that could produce a 10 per cent income for a high income fund. Typically,
such funds - which are offered by Foreign &amp; Colonial and Morgen Grenfell -
employ options, shares and cash.
But S&amp;P's decision to drop the new product poured doubt on the feasibility
of generating high income while preserving capital. 'We found that there is
a half-life, although the rate of the erosion is difficult to calculate
because of variable interest rates,' said Mr Emery.
However, Mr Nigel Legge, managing director of James Capel Unit Trusts,
maintained that high income unit trusts were not necessarily a minefield
that investors should avoid but the element of risk should be appreciated.
'The issue is how opaque they are. It is a question of how clearly products
like these should be presented.'
Mr Legge said that while large returns on investments in equities are
proven, that message is not always understood by investors. 'Shares are by
far the best asset to beat inflation and I'm not sure that is generally
realised.'
And he added that when derivatives enter the equation in a unit-trust
product, then the task of making transparent that product to investors is
exacerbated.
S&amp;P has not abandoned the idea of a double-digit unit trust but prospects of
offering one are slight. 'We will keep it under review but unless we see
something new it is highly unlikely,' said Mr Emery.

FT  06 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Tracking the behaviour of stock pickers - A
Citywatch survey taking in 50 of the UK's largest fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of 12 leading fund managers account for half the 'stock-picking'
behaviour of the UK stock market, disproportionately contributing to the
volatility of individual share prices, according to a new study.
The study, conducted by Citywatch, a City information service which monitors
institutional shareholding, concluded also that many fund managers do very
little real stock-picking. Instead, their choices closely mimic the relative
value of shares within the FT-A All-Share Index although they do not
necessarily describe themselves to clients as index trackers.
'There certainly are closet indexers out there who do not take any bets on
stocks,' said the chairman of one leading UK fund management company.
'Clients may well ask themselves 'why am I paying active management fees for
passive management?'', he said. Active fund managers typically earn fees of
0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent while passive index-trackers may charge clients
no more than 0.05 per cent of assets under management.
The Citywatch survey included 50 of the UK's largest fund managers measured
by asset size. However, of these, several are in-house managers who do not
compete for clients and a number are UK insurance companies whose clients
consist largely of their own policyholders.
The data was gathered by examining the share registers in early November of
all UK traded companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 300m or
above. Citywatch identified the ultimate holders behind the nominee
companies and was able to distinguish which shareholders controlled each
group of shares.
Mr Mark O'Hare, chief executive of Citywatch, says the data also has
implications for companies' relations with their shareholders. It might be
argued that directors should focus their attentions on improving
communication with stock-pickers who will dump or buy shares depending on
their perception of the company. There could be less value in wooing
shareholders who are likely to maintain an indexed holding in the company
regardless of its prospects.
Citywatch approached its analysis by first identifying the average
percentage of individual company shares held by each manager and the
difference between each manager's largest and smallest percentage holdings.
Researchers then calculated a standard deviation, the extent to which a
manager's percentage shareholding varies from one company to the next. It is
this calculation which is said to indicate stock picking behaviour (see
table).
The study found that M&amp;G, the UK-based unit trust company, had the greatest
propensity to stock pick. Others who rank high on the list of stock-pickers
include Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford, Clerical Medical, Gartmore
Investment Management, Guardian Royal Exchange and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management.
Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, which is in the most active 15, says
he is not surprised by the findings. 'M&amp;G have a pronounced value style
focusing on recovery stocks,' he said. By contrast, Gartmore, has a
management style which emphasises so-called growth stocks. If a manager
makes selections based on changes in, say, share price-to-book value, he is
by definition a stock picker.
However, the fact that a manager stock picks does not tell you everything
you need to know about his style, according to Mr Myners. Gartmore ranks
equally with PDFM on stock-picking 'but we are mirror images of each other'.
While both managers have outperformed the industry average in recent years,
PDFM looks for stocks with a low price-earnings ratio, a very different
approach from that of Gartmore.
Not surprisingly, Citywatch found the lowest propensity to stock pick
evident among fund managers whose avowed policy is to manage an
index-tracking pool as part of their UK equities portfolio. Heading this
list is Postel Investment Management with several large in-house managed
funds close behind.
Pension scheme consultants who advise clients on picking a fund manager said
the data largely confirms the views they have formed from a more qualitative
assessment of styles. However, they cautioned against relying solely on that
type of analysis to form judgments.
'You have got to know about each manager's client base,' says Mr Michael
Coop, assistant investment consultant at actuarial firm R Watson and Co. The
tendency to stock pick may be as much a reflection of the type of mandate
the manager has won, as it is of style.
Also, because the data only examined the larger companies traded on the
London Stock Exchange, a manager who stock picks heavily among smaller
companies would not show up.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Goldman profit shares top Dollars 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partners of Goldman Sachs, the US-based global investment bank, will all
receive a minimum profit share of Dollars 5m this year, according to a bank
insider.
The record profit shares - which are added to each partner's capital account
at the firm and can only be withdrawn at retirement - reflect the dramatic
leap in Goldman's profitability this year.
The Canadian Bond Rating Service estimates that Goldman made Dollars 2.3bn
pre-tax profits in the first three quarters of 1993, up from just Dollars
940m in the same period the year before. As a result, even the most junior
partner will receive Dollars 5m and those higher up will receive far more.
The 161 partners, of which 26 are based in London, can withdraw their
capital from the firm over a phased period after they retire or quit. While
they remain at the firm, they can receive interest at a fixed rate on their
capital.
Separately, it emerged that up to 70 Goldman executives working in the
London office - including the 26 partners - would receive total remuneration
this year in excess of Dollars 1m, making it one of the most generous UK
payers. London-based employees below the level of partner were recently told
they would receive annual bonuses equal to at least 30 per cent of their
basic salary.
The big increase in earnings and bonuses at Goldman is the latest evidence
that Wall Street's long profit boom shows no sign of slowing. For the past
three years, US securities houses and investment banks have earned record
profits, thanks primarily to extremely low interest rates in the US and
overseas.
Like many of its competitors, a significant portion of Goldman's profits
have come from its proprietary trading activities, in which the firm uses
large amounts of its own capital to bet on the short- and long-term
direction of securities, currencies and interest rates. Goldman's need for
capital to conduct proprietary trading explains why it cannot allow its
partners to withdraw profit shares in cash.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Italy offers discount in bank sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government is to offer a substantial discount on the shares of
Credito Italiano, the country's seventh-largest bank, to launch a
substantial programme of privatising industrial and financial assets over
the next two years.
Today, IRI, the state holding company, will be offering its controlling 64
per cent stake in Credito to institutional and private investors at L2,075
(Dollars 1.24) per ordinary share. This is a discount of 9.6 per cent on
Friday's close of L2,299 but considerably more on the previous six month's
average price of L2,450.
The discount is further sweetened by a bonus share offer. Credito is
promising a 1-for-10 bonus (with a ceiling of 1,500 new shares) to all those
who take up this week's offer and retain their shares for three years.
IRI is offering 17 per cent of savings shares at L1,707. With the payment of
L160 per share these can be converted into ordinary shares. The whole
operation is expected to raise L1,830bn towards relieving IRI's financial
problems.
Bank officials predicted on Saturday, when the pricing decision was
unveiled, the shares would be oversubscribed between five and six times.
Among the around 400 foreign institutions contacted, several said they would
bid for the maximum 2 per cent permitted.
Mr Romano Prodi, head of IRI, said the pricing policy had been based on the
advice of Goldman Sachs, global co-ordinator for the Credito privatisation.
The valuation had been carried out by JP Morgan.
'The sale of Credito will change the history of our country: the state will
no longer be the owner of Italy's biggest banks,' he said.
'This will accelerate the creation of a proper economic democracy in Italy.'
Credito is one of three leading financial institutions controlled by IRI,
while, over all, the state still controls almost two-thirds of the banking
sector.
Mr Giuseppe Bruno, Credito's chief executive, said the bank was hoping to
pick up 100,000 new shareholders as a result of the privatisation.
Bank employees are being offered saving shares at L1,707 each. The minimum
purchase has been fixed at 2,500 shares. Private Italian savers are expected
to be allocated at least 40 per cent of the shares.
Over the weekend, Italian analysts were quoted as being satisfied with the
pricing. They said the market had been expecting a figure between L2,000 and
L2,100. However, foreign brokers said they felt the government might have
discounted further to underwrite a successful first public offer of state
assets.

FT  06 DEC 93 / BT anger over European rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications will seize on a far-reaching alliance between the
French and German state telecommunications operators, set to be announced
tomorrow, to campaign for a rapid dismantling of barriers impeding
competition between Europe's telecommunications companies.
In a speech to an FT conference tomorrow, BT chairman Mr Iain Vallance will
also vent BT's mounting frustration that over-regulation of its UK business
is holding it back.
In an outspoken attack on the European Commission, Mr Vallance will call on
it to abandon attempts at tight 'utility-style' regulation and instead
produce early proposals to allow competing networks to be built on the
continent.
So far, the Commission has only agreed to allow competition over existing
public networks, and delayed its introduction until 1998.
Describing the UK as the 'test bed' for the new age of competing multi-media
services, Mr Vallance will step up BT's complaint that overseas operators,
particularly the US regional Bell companies building cable and mobile
networks in the UK, are free to provide a broader range of services to UK
customers than is BT itself.
'Over the last decade, the UK has been conditioned to believe that, for
companies, big is inherently bad,' he will warn. 'The trouble is that the
rest of the world does not.'
Citing recent moves by US telephone companies into the cellular mobile and
cable sectors, he will note that BT 'may do neither of these things in its
home market, because of the (regulatory) bar imposed on true convergence'.
Although BT has a part share in mobile phone operator Cellnet, its freedom
to integrate 'fixed' and 'mobile' services is circumscribed.
Mr Vallance is concerned that BT faces a 'utility trap' of detailed
constraints on its pricing and deployment of technology, while hostile
alliances form against it on the continent. BT is also anxious to prevent a
Franco-German alliance forming long in advance of the opening of European
markets to full competition.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Alliances usher in new era: The challenges faced by phone
regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The speed of change in the telecommunications world is posing unprecedented
challenges to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. For Europe, the
international link-up set to be announced tomorrow between France Telecom
and Deutsche Telekom, the French and German state operators, will pose them
in acute form.
The pressure comes from three sources.
Liberalisation. A decade ago, the UK and the US started the global trend
towards open competition. In the US, 'Ma Bell' was broken up into American
Telephone and Telegraph and seven regional operators; AT&amp;T was left with the
long-distance business but subject to competition. In the UK, privatisation
of British Telecommunications went hand in hand with the licensing of
Mercury as a long-distance competitor. Since then the UK has allowed in
further competitors, including US regional operators building cable
television and telephone networks.
In June the European Union agreed that all EU national telephone operators
would be obliged to allow 'voice' competition from 1998 - with extensions
for four poorer states. There is widespread concern that a Franco-German
link-up before 1998, bringing together the world's second- and third-largest
operators, will 'sew up' much of the European market in advance of 1998.
Apart from banning any alliance, the European Commission has two other
options. It might make consent conditional upon an acceleration of
competition. And/or it might extend competition to infrastructure, so that
competitors can build their own networks and not be obliged to buy capacity
from existing national operators. Under the June accord, the Commission is
not even obliged to publish a proposals on the infrastructure issue until
January 1995.
Alliances. The era of telecommunications companies as national monopoly
utilities is rapidly waning. In their place is what Mr Iain Vallance,
chairman of BT, calls the 'complex hybrid' - part national utility, part
international competitor, in an increasingly vigorous market to challenge
operators in their home countries and provide cross-border services to
transnational companies.
The industry believes alliances are de rigueur for the complex hybrids,
particularly in Europe with its patchwork of medium-sized and small
operators. Three European alliances already exist: BT has teamed up with the
US operator MCI; Unisource brings together the Swedish, Swiss and Dutch
state operators, with the Spanish joining as a kind of associate member last
week; and Eunetcom will link France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. AT&amp;T is
also looking for a European partner.
How close should the alliances be allowed to become - particularly those
between the larger operators? And who should police them? The EU has no
equivalent of the US Federal Communications Commission. If the French and
Germans are allowed to team up, say the critics, their governments, nervous
about competition, are unlikely to strive hard for open access to their home
markets, while the EU will find itself in a weak position to monitor their
activities. Convergence. Meanwhile, the worlds of telecommunications,
computing, and entertainment are rapidly converging. Three spectacular
alliances in the US - AT&amp;T with McCaw, US West with Time Warner, Bell
Atlantic with TCI - have been formed in the past six months alone, while BT
proclaims itself anxious to join the same game if UK regulatory hurdles are
lifted.
From this perspective, the Franco-German alliance might be seen as a
conservative, almost irrelevant step in the global telecommunications
industry. Constructing bigger telephone and data networks may matter less
than developing innovative multi-media services to carry over them.
Perhaps, but for the European Commission grappling with the Franco-German
alliance, today's world will be challenge enough. And that means developing
an open, coherent structure for competition - whether in 1998 or before.

FT  06 DEC 93 / PLO leadership rift widens as deadline nears on Israel talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation resumed talks in Cairo
yesterday amid a growing PLO leadership rift and recognition that the start
of Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be delayed.
The crisis in the PLO's upper ranks deepened after Mr Mahmoud Abbas (also
known as Abu Mazen), the man who signed the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord
in Washington, refused to participate in a newly formed PLO committee set up
to avert criticism of Mr Yassir Arafat's handling of the peace talks.
With only seven days left before Israel and the PLO were supposed, under the
terms of the peace accord, to sign a protocol marking the start of a
four-month troop withdrawal, the two sides remain deeply divided on a
complex set of issues.
The talks, being held at a secret location in Cairo, have yet to agree the
size of the Jericho area; who should control the border crossings between
Jericho and Jordan and between Gaza and Egypt; the extent of the troop
withdrawal; security arrangements for Israeli settlers; and the timetable
for further releases of up to 10,000 Palestinian prisoners being held by
Israel.
The PLO has until now insisted on keeping the December 13 deadline, being
under pressure to deliver results to increasingly sceptical Palestinians.
But there were signs yesterday that it was prepared to accept a two-week
delay.
Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said the organisation was sparing
no effort to finish on time in spite of recent comments by Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israeli prime minister, suggesting the need for a delay. But Mr Shaath
accepted that Israeli reservations about the progress in the talks might
force a delay.
In Amman, PLO officials said Mr Arafat, PLO chairman, had told the central
committee of his Fatah faction that he was reluctantly prepared for a
two-week delay in the face of Israeli intransigence on key issues.
Palestinians say any delay will arouse suspicions about Israeli intentions
and fuel violence by extremists on both sides.
The delay will further deepen the PLO leadership crisis. Criticism of Mr
Arafat's handling of the peace negotiations has solidified around three
senior PLO officials - Mr Abbas, Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo and Mr Suleiman
Najjab. All three are members of the 12-strong PLO executive committee and
have been among the most important voices for peace and moderation within
the PLO, backing Mr Arafat against more extremist factions.
Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala), the PLO's chief economics negotiator, is also said
to have supported the campaign to force Mr Arafat to democratise the PLO,
bring in professionals from outside the organisation and allow the PLO's
senior officials a greater say in policymaking.
In a move to quell the criticism, Mr Arafat had asked Mr Abbas to head a PLO
committee to direct detailed peace talks with Israel. Mr Abbas refused the
appointment and said he would have nothing to do with the committee.

FT  06 DEC 93 / UK joins row over EC spending plan: Clarke links up with
Germany and France in dispute on public works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, stepped into the long-simmering power
struggle between European finance ministers and the European Commission last
night over plans by Brussels to spend nearly Ecu124bn (Pounds 93bn) on
public works programmes in Europe over the next six years.
The plans include a new scheme for the Commission to borrow on the
international capital markets to finance the projects.
They are central features in a White Paper on employment and growth, to be
presented by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to the European summit
on Friday.
After a ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Clarke joined his French and
German colleagues in complaining they had been unable to vet the final
version of the paper agreed hours earlier by the Commission.
Mr Clarke said: 'I don't think there is anybody in this room who would
engage in expenditure of a couple of thousand pounds without having a
document explaining how. The governments of Europe will not conceivably
expect to agree to new arrangements for borrowing between Ecu20bn a year
without so much as a sheet of paper on the table. This is no way to run a
sensible organisation.'
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, quoted Chancellor Helmut Kohl as
saying the idea for 'off-budget' Commission borrowing was unrealistic. Mr
Gunther Rexrodt, German economics minister, said: 'We don't accept it.'
Mr Edmond Alphandery, French economy minister, said he was unhappy about not
seeing the white paper, but he supported the idea of extra finance for big
road, rail, telecommunications and environmental projects.
The power struggle involves Mr Delors's non-binding paper setting out
long-term ideas for promoting economic growth and competitiveness, and the
legally-binding but diluted version of the macro-economic guidelines for the
EU which finance ministers agreed last night. These guidelines stress price
stability and budget discipline.
The Commission said yesterday that only Ecu7bn of the proposed annual
spending of Ecu20.6bn was new money. The rest has already been earmarked in
the budgetary guidelines approved last December at the European summit in
Edinburgh, or through the European Investment Bank.
Mr Henning Christophersen, Commissioner responsible for economics, said the
plan was to allow governments and companies to borrow funds via the European
Commission which has a good credit rating and can obtain funds at
preferential rates.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Private cash for schools studied: NM Rothschild to report to
Patten on education financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department for Education has for the first time asked a UK merchant
bank, NM Rothschild, to examine how the private sector could build and
operate facilities for state schools.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, has asked for proposals on how
companies could be enticed to provide everything from concert halls to
sports facilities for local authority-funded schools and the
grant-maintained sector.
The initiative, part of the government's drive to encourage private finance
in the public sector, is being given a high priority within the department.
Mr Simon Linnett, a director at NM Rothschild, has been asked by Mr Patten
to establish a team of three executives to work alongside the department's
internal working group on private finance in schools.
It is understood that Mr Linnett, who advised the government on the Northern
Ireland Electricity flotation, has already identified possible options to
harness private sector skills and finance within education.
They include encouraging companies to build and operate sports arenas,
concert halls, theatres, science laboratories and colleges that would be
rented by schools in the day and by councils in the evenings.
The department would like secondary schools in England and Wales to be
allowed to mortgage their buildings to raise funds to improve facilities.
According to Whitehall officials, ministers believe that better maintained
and operated facilities could save state schools money spent on repairs for
buildings which are in severe disrepair.
Given the constraints of public expenditure, officials argue that schools
may have no alternative to seeking help from the private sector, although
private borrowing costs more than public sector finance.
The initiative on financing for schools will borrow from the experience of
Britain's universities, which already receive more than Pounds 1bn a year,
more than a quarter of their total income, from sources in the private
sector.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On one score, at least, the French government must be feeling rather smug.
Over recent months, the Bank of France has gradually eased interest rates
without unduly damaging the franc. Indeed, such has been the currency's
strength that the vast hole in France's foreign currency reserves has now
been plugged. The franc has returned to within a centime of its old ERM
floor.
The franc's vigour will comfort those who regard European monetary union as
an overriding political goal. Yet the government seems unlikely to use the
opportunity to accelerate interest rate cuts, despite the precarious
economy. Consumption has been on an erratic upward path suggesting recession
is slackening. But unemployment has now surpassed 12 per cent, threatening
to undermine recovery next year.
Those economic worries have unsettled the French bourse: the CAC-40 is now 2
per cent off its October peak. But other factors, too, have sapped the
market's strength. The bourse has been flooded with new equity issues this
autumn. Quite apart from the big privatisations, several companies have
tapped the market for fresh funds. In all, some FFr100bn of new equity has
been raised this year.
The bourse will remain volatile until rates do come down and recovery
asserts itself. But the liquidity argument underpinning the market still
holds good longer term. French savings ratios remain high and some of the
FFr1,200bn held in money market funds must seep into equities. The proposed
creation of private pension funds can only help.

FT  06 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bill to privatise British Coal is complex, but no more so than the job
in hand. By the time the over-arching legislation has been passed and the
detailed business propositions for the five regions written, the snows will
have melted. It will be next summer before the tenders can be invited. Those
thinking of buying mines will thus have little more than three years of firm
coal contracts left by the nearest feasible handover date. That makes bids
from management buy-outs difficult to mount, since they will only have
reliable cash flow for a short period.
The relative inexperience of many British Coal managers in running
commercial enterprises may also deter banks from lending to MBOs.
A shortage of bidders at high prices may force the government to lower its
sights over the amount it can hope to raise from the sale. Since there is a
price for everything, there must also be a level at which international
coalmining groups would overcome their qualms and bid. That may, however, be
closer to Pounds 300m for the total industry rather than the Pounds 800m or
so which has been touted. At the lower figure companies could hope to have
written the mines down and earned an acceptable return on capital before
1998. After that any mine owner faces the unenviable prospect of negotiating
new contracts with generators which own deep water ports. They showed just
how tough they could be when they saw off the government last spring.

FT  06 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Credito Italiano
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those expecting bargain-basement prices from Italy's privatisation programme
are in for a disappointment. The 9.6 per cent discount at which shares in
Credito Italiano have been priced is markedly less generous than offered by
France for the sale of BNP. It can only be assumed the discount reflects
confidence in the strength of international demand. Credito's shares have
already fallen by 30 per cent from the peak reached in January.
The recent fall of the Milan market and the fluid political situation are
reminders of the risks. An orderly restructuring of Ferruzzi, which now
looks likely, will help settle nerves. With around L1,000bn caught up in the
restructuring net - and twice that amount lent to the sprawling empire as a
whole - Credito is worryingly exposed. A hefty provision against this and
other bad debts this year looks inevitable, but receivership for Ferruzzi
would have been the worst of all possible worlds. Once this year's bad debt
provision is quantified, investors will rest easier still.
Besides, it is difficult to justify buying Credito for the earnings
prospects this year or next. Provisioning aside, 1994 will be a difficult
year, as trading income from the bond market declines and interest margins
are squeezed. The strength of recovery thereafter turns on management's
ability to develop fee income. Credito's life insurance marketing agreement
with Commercial Union is an opportunity in this regard. Shepherding
depositors in the direction of privatisation issues is another.

FT  06 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: BT's valuable connections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As Oftel's decision on the rate competitors are to be charged for using BT's
lines has drawn shouts of pain from all sides, it can probably be concluded
that it is fair. Mercury complains that the large incremental payments it
will have to make as it hits market share hurdles are a disincentive. BT, on
the other hand, argues that since Mercury does not pay the full costs of
using its network, its own shareholders are, in effect, subsidising Mercury.
Even if that is so, there is a case for seeding the development of
competition. If Mercury can use cheap access to undercut BT and increase its
market share, that is acceptable up to a point. Oftel's hurdles of a
competitor holding 10 per cent for some contribution to local network costs
and 25 per cent to bear the full load seem reasonable.
Underlying the whole issue, however, is the questionable notion that BT
would charge more for its lines and less for its calls were it free to do
so. In cities, competition from cable operators will hold down rentals. In
remote areas, BT's licence, which does not allow it to differentiate between
regions, will peg rental charges. In some senses, maintaining these
expensive customers is a social obligation, and a clear identification of
the real subsidy is desirable.
That, however, might well result in a lower figure than BT currently claims,
as part of the problem arises from the company's historically expensive
local infrastructure. Such costs properly belong to its shareholders. The
reduced rate of return which Oftel has allowed BT for handling third party
traffic adds to the impression of a squeeze. With all this and the RPI -7.5
price cap, the pressure is on at BT.

FT  06 DEC 93 / The heat is on for UK power: Economic viability will be the
big question in the government's nuclear review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any company which earns nearly half a billion pounds in six months is keen
to trumpet the fact. But when Nuclear Electric unveiled interim profits of
Pounds 497m last week, it was also sending a clear message to its owner, the
British government: 'Privatise us.' The next few months will tell whether
that message got through.
Any day now the government will launch a much-awaited review of the UK
nuclear power industry. Although the terms of reference have still to be
announced, the outcome is bound to determine whether nuclear power faces a
future of growth or whether it will be condemned to decline and ultimately
extinction. Nuclear Electric, the largest component of the industry with 11
nuclear stations in England and Wales, is eager to prove that nuclear power
is not only necessary to the country's energy supply but able to stand on
its own commercial feet.
It will be no easy task. The industry's troubled history, its unfulfilled
promises of boundless cheap electricity, its appetite for state support and
costly technologies, its unfavourable public image, will all have to be
overcome if the review is to have a positive outcome. Doubts about nuclear
power exist not only in the mind of the general public, but also among the
City of London financial community which forced the government to drop
nuclear power from its electricity privatisation programme only four years
ago. The risks, bankers and investors thought, were too great for the
private sector to bear.
This scepticism is not unique to Britain. Since the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster in 1986 only two big industrialised countries have stuck to a
policy of expanding nuclear capacity: Japan and France. Many others,
including the US, Italy and Sweden, have moratoria or outright bans on new
nuclear plants.
Although disappointments with nuclear power have instilled wariness in the
UK government, it does not, like other countries, have any outright
objections to it. However, ministers have made clear that any development
must be capable of being funded by the private sector.
'It cannot be assumed that the government will provide the finance for new
(nuclear) capacity in the future,' said Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, in a
recent speech to trade unionists. 'In the context of an extremely tough
spending round, why should the taxpayer be willing to fund new nuclear
stations costing several billions, when this money could fund hospitals,
schools or policemen on the beat?'
The industry knows that economic viability will be the central question in
the review, and it has already taken steps to deal with it.
Since the aborted privatisation, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, its
cousin north of the border with two power stations, have undertaken a
vigorous campaign to reduce costs and cut staff. Nuclear Electric has
managed to raise its share of the electricity market in England and Wales
over that period from 16 per cent to almost 25 per cent. This sharp
improvement has been largely due to its success in overcoming technical
difficulties with its five advanced gas-cooled reactor stations that were
built in the 1970s. Scottish Nuclear has achieved a 20 per cent increase in
output while cutting the cost of its product by 10 per cent through improved
efficiency.
Nuclear Electric has also brought in private sector blood, including Dr
Robert Hawley, its chief executive who last year moved over from Northern
Engineering Industries, part of Rolls-Royce, and is keen to escape from the
governmental leash. Nuclear Electric's confidence that it can be sold to the
private sector rests on its assertion that, as Mr John Collier, the
chairman, said in announcing last week's results, 'we are every bit as
commercial as the privatised generators'.
The main indication of this is the company's claim that it would be able to
produce electricity from a newly built nuclear station at less than 3p a
unit. This is within reach of prices in the wholesale market in England and
Wales known as the electricity pool where power this year has traded at an
average of about 2.6p a unit.
However, the 3p claim has been greeted with some scepticism in the markets.
One reason is that it assumes a capital financing cost of 8 per cent - the
figure used by the government in all its big projects. However, this is well
below the level that the financial market is likely to demand. 'The private
sector will insist on at least 12 per cent,' says Mr Gordon MacKerron of
Sussex University's science policy and research unit. 'Eight per cent is for
very unrisky businesses. Nuclear is subjected to any number of risks -
regulatory, political, insurance and accident.'
The risk element has further implications. Much of the expected cost of
nuclear power is the so-called back-end element needed to pay for disposing
of radioactive waste and decommissioning radioactive plant. The nuclear
companies set money aside for this each year, but less than will actually be
needed because they assume the money will accrue interest over the
decommissioning period after a plant is closed down, 50 years in the case of
a new station.
Mr Clive Bates, of Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, sees a problem
with this. 'They (the nuclear companies) say their estimates are
conservative but the problems come when you vary the decommissioning period.
Where would the money come from, for example, if environmental circumstances
forced them to decommission after 20 years?'
Nuclear Electric's efforts to project itself as a financially viable,
stand-alone concern have also been bedevilled by the so-called nuclear levy:
Pounds 1.3bn which is added to electricity consumers' bills every year to
help build up the provisions for decommissioning. Although the levy will
shrink over the coming years and is scheduled to disappear altogether in
1998, it has been held up by nuclear's critics as proof of its inability to
survive as a fully commercial concern.
The accusation is misdirected, says Nuclear Electric, because the levy
proceeds are intended not to create new provisions but to replace provisions
which were created by the former Central Electricity Generating Board but
not transferred to Nuclear Electric when it was incorporated in 1990. At the
moment, the levy transforms Nuclear Electric's bottom line from a loss into
a profit. Without it the latest result would have been Pounds 118m in the
red. But Nuclear Electric has set itself the target of making a profit
before levy proceeds by 1995.
Scottish Nuclear, which does not benefit from the levy, makes a profit -
Pounds 65.8m last year - with the help of some premium-priced supply
contracts with Scottish Power and Hydro-Elecric. Unfortunately for Nuclear
Electric's public relations offensive, however, Scottish Nuclear has
recently lost its earlier enthusiasm for privatisation. Mr James Hann, its
chairman, has expressed concern that some people in government think their
main task is to get state-owned energy concerns 'off their hands and in the
quickest time possible'. He thinks the nuclear power industry should
concentrate on becoming more commercial before entertaining ideas of
entering the private sector.
His view tends to find a strong echo in the City where industry analysts and
bankers still see too much uncertainty in nuclear power for investors'
comfort. 'Potential investors will need a lot of convincing before they even
begin to look at the industry seriously,' says one observer. 'There have
been too many problems in the past.'
However, the criterion for privatisation is not simply whether Nuclear
Electric is commercial. Equally important is whether it can look forward to
a future of growth, and a rising stream of dividends to attract investors.
This raises the more publicly controversial question of whether Britain
should build new nuclear power stations.
At the moment, only one station is being built: Sizewell B in Suffolk which
is due to start up next year. But over the next decade the six remaining
first-generation Magnox reactors will have to be replaced if nuclear
capacity is to retain its present level, and more will have to be built if
the industry is to expand.
Nuclear Electric has already lodged an application to build Sizewell C, the
third station on the Sizewell site, to the annoyance of the government which
saw this as jumping the review gun. However, the company has also made clear
that building only one station would not be enough. If nuclear is to achieve
the full economies of scale and compete with other fuels, it will need the
go-ahead for several more. 'Sizewell C could not stand on its own. It would
have to be part of a series,' says Nuclear Electric's Dr Hawley who believes
that nuclear needs a sustained 20-30 per cent share of the electricity
market to realise its full potential.
Thus, privatisation could imply a huge commitment to nuclear power, probably
on a scale that ministers would have difficulty accepting, and public
opinion might not tolerate. Anticipating such opposition, the industry has
been pressing the government to extend the review beyond questions of
financial viability to include wider benefits which it argues nuclear can
bring.
Chief among these is the environment. The fact that nuclear power produces
no gas emissions could help the government achieve its international
commitments to clean Britain's atmosphere. Another is the need for a
diversified energy supply to check the growing dependence on fossil fuels,
particularly finite reserves of North Sea gas. A third is the substantial
employment that nuclear energy creates, particularly during the construction
phase. A fourth is the preservation of the skills and technology that
Britain has acquired through its nuclear programme. And the fifth is a much
improved safety record.
Whether ministers will be moved by any of these arguments remains to be
seen. The environmental case has a hefty counterweight in the risks of
radioactive contamination and the large amount of irradiated equipment which
has to be dealt with when a nuclear station closes. The problem of nuclear
waste management has already given the government a headache with the
decision on whether to proceed with the Thorp reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
Fuel diversity is scarcely an issue at a time when Britain enjoys the widest
choice of energy in its industrial history (coal, oil, gas and nuclear)
though the long lead times needed to build nuclear stations might strengthen
the case for preserving a nuclear programme in anticipation of possible fuel
shortages next century. At the moment, UK generating capacity vastly exceeds
demand.
The technological case for maintaining a nuclear industry would need to be
treated with caution. Although the UK led the world in developing civil
nuclear power, it failed to capitalise on the achievement, and the most
widespread technologies used elsewhere in the world are now non-British.
This suggests that a privatised Nuclear Electric, freed of any obligation to
'buy British', might even opt for a US or a Japanese model.
In the mind of the general public, safety is a key issue in any decision to
expand nuclear power. In spite of Chernobyl, the UK industry is keen to see
the issue debated because it believes that it now has a good story to tell.
Mr Collier, the Nuclear Electric chairman, says: 'The industry is one of the
safest industries in the UK. There has never been an emergency putting the
public at risk during 30 years of civil nuclear power operations.' Mr Hawley
says the average Briton gets a larger dose of radiation from eating a
chocolate Brazil nut than from an average annual exposure to nuclear power.
There are no simple answers for the government in the forthcoming review,
and ministers will have to follow a complex line of arguments.
Does Britain need more nuclear power? If the answer is yes but the
government declines to pay for it, the job would have to go to the private
sector. But would the City be prepared to finance the industry, and would
the public be prepared to accept the expansion of nuclear capacity that
would be necessary to make it viable?
There must be strong doubts about all these questions. However the
government might decide that the national interest warranted special action
of some kind. Ministers could, for example, take the Magnox stations off
Nuclear Electric's hands and free it to enter the private sector unburdened
by past liabilities. Or if they attached value to nuclear's environmental
case, they could help by treating some of its decommissioning expenses as a
social cost to be charged to the taxpayer. In other words the government
could underwrite the liabilities.
But Mr John Baker, who argued the case for Sizewell B when at the Central
Electricity Generating Board and is now chief executive of the National
Power generating company, says such an outcome would need a significant
change of attitude by ministers. 'The government has always had rules which
say that if you carry the liabilities you take the assets as well.
Privatisation is for the birds unless the government changes the rules.'
This is the first in a series of articles on nuclear power and the UK
government's nuclear review

FT  06 DEC 93 / Leading Article: India's chance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, did not win a resounding vote
of confidence in six recent state elections. But his main opposition, the
Bharatiya Janata party, fared even worse. Voters' broad rejection of the
BJP's Hindu militancy appears to shore up the Congress government. It now
has an opportunity to press on with the economic reform programme, its main,
though incomplete, achievement.
Younger companies and business people in Bombay revel in the freedom created
by the end of industrial licensing and the liberalisation of trade,
investment and foreign exchange. With bureaucratic obstacles reduced, there
is no longer a need to shuttle constantly to Delhi, seeking licences.
Foreign investors too have been gaining confidence that there has been a
true change of direction.
Yet reform has still not delivered rapid growth of exports or the economy.
Industrialists who once enjoyed cosy markets are complaining that they do
not have a 'level playing field' against foreign entrants, forgetting that
the previous tilt in their favour prevented them from gaining the
technological and managerial skills they needed. Mr Rao should encourage
pro-reform voices to argue that Indian business needs less protection, not
more, if it is to compete with China and other dynamic economies to the
east.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister and architect of the reforms, needs
strong support as he prepares for the budget in February. Since electoral
considerations will begin to obtrude by 1995, this will be his best
opportunity to make significant progress. However, his ability to do so is
limited by political constraints. The determination of the Congress party to
alter the way India is run - with big government and extensive patronage -
will be measured by its willingness to reform and shrink the public sector,
to allow companies to shed redundant labour forces and to stop banks making
cheap farm loans they do not expect to recover.
Mr Singh can be expected to proceed with what he has begun. He will cut
subsidies and raise administered prices (a process made more urgent by the
damage which the state elections have been allowed to do to the budget
deficit). He will also cut tariffs and proceed with the tax reforms designed
to compensate for a fall in customs duties. He will probably allow greater
private and foreign participation in financial services and in the
development of infrastructure.
All such measures should be applauded, but the government will eventually
have to address the broader and more demanding reform agenda, which will
mean taking head on the powerful vested interests which stand in the way.
There is no alternative if the country is to compete with its east Asian
neighbours.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Enter Mr Delors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It promises to be a lively week for the debate on European industry. On
Friday, Mr Jacques Delors' white book on competitiveness will be discussed
by the EU's heads of government. Meanwhile, the European Round Table,
consisting of 40 heads of Europe's biggest companies, has produced a
counterblast against the provisions of the social chapter.
In itself, this might seem unremarkable. But according to the British
members of the ERT, it represents a significant shift of opinion. Industrial
bosses in Germany may have muttered in private for years over the indirect
costs of labour. But in public, they have defended the contract between
social partners. If they have been converted to the British view of
industrial relations, this is a sea-change indeed.
It might not do to count on it. The loading of social costs on to industry
is partly a cyclical phenomenon. The boom years of the late 1980s, for
instance, saw an outburst of environmental legislation. Now that the bill is
being presented in the depths of recession, there is a perceptible ebbing of
enthusiasm. The same is true of the latest batch of social measures
transacted at EU level.
But these things may be beside the point. Even supposing industry's appetite
for social costs varies with the cycle, the cyclical recovery this time may
be slow and hesitant. That might in itself argue for a pragmatic shift in
policy. Mr Delors, in a speech prepared for the Confederation of British
Industry last month, argued strongly in favour of the social chapter. But
the fact that he felt moved to address the CBI - and, indeed, turned up to
last Friday's presentation of the ERT's arguments - suggests a possible
meeting of minds.
That would be very welcome. Some of the ERT's arguments deserve
consideration: for instance, that there might be a relaxation of social
costs for smaller companies which are creating employment, leaving larger
companies to shoulder the burden if necessary.
There is also something in the idea of a European competitiveness council,
along US lines, which could monitor the Commission's efforts to promote key
technologies. Above all, the ERT is surely sensible to argue that the
creation of cheap low-tech jobs now is compatible with the creation of
expensive high-tech ones later.
Mr Delors' task is more complex. He has to reconcile diverging views about
deregulation, interest rates, macroeconomic co-ordination, the EU's role in
financing big projects and much else. As he prepares for the final year of
his presidency, he knows that the EU badly needs intellectual coherence in
its economic thinking, after the disasters of the exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Delors' white book is awaited with interest.

Meanwhile, Observer hears that the Bank of England official who probably

Michael Hastilow, the Bank's first-ever in-house dentist, is retiring after
14 years of sharpening the Old Lady's teeth.
Hastilow seemed born to the job. His great grandfather was an ivory carver
and his grandfather was a butcher. He quickly built up a loyal following at
the Bank, although some have been known to jib at his prices. On being told
the charge for extracting a tooth, an official once complained that it was
an awful lot for two minutes' work. 'All right,' said Hastilow, 'how would

Good news for central bankers. They are in one of the few long-term growth
businesses still showing no signs of flagging, according to Morgan Stanley's
latest Central Bank Directory.
There were more than eight times as many central banks in 1990 as there were
in 1900, and in the last three years another 22 have popped up, bringing the
total to 170.
The bad news for central bankers is that job security is not what it was. In
the past year, the bosses of more than a third of central banks have been
changed, nearly twice the rate that might have been expected, says editor
Robert Pringle, if all had seen out their full terms.
Prize for the longest suffering (sorry, serving) governor goes to Erik
Hoffmeyer in Denmark, in situ since 1965. He is one of the lucky 19 who have
been appointed for an 'indefinite' term.
However, this is not always a ticket for life, as Brazil's recent central
bank bosses will testify. They have served on average for less than 12
months each, despite having the same sort of deal as Hoffmeyer.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Observer: Lucas's loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Giordano's appointment as the new chairman of British Gas is good
news for British Gas, but it is upsetting for Lucas Industries, which is
also in need of a new chairman.
Giordano joined the Lucas board last March and has been chairing the
nominations committee charged with finding a replacement for Sir Anthony
Gill, Lucas's 63-year-old chairman and chief executive.
Having finally persuaded George Simpson, British Aerospace's deputy chief
executive, to take over as Lucas's ceo, Giordano was also supposed to assist
in the smooth handover of the executive leadership. Giordano had seemed firm
favourite to take over as non-executive chairman from Sir Anthony.
But Giordano is off to British Gas on January 1, so he will not have a lot
of time left to help Lucas, where the new chief executive does not start
until May. The net result is that the agonisingly slow reshuffle at the top
of Lucas is going to take even longer.

What's in a name? Plenty, if you are south of the border of the United
States of America.
Mexico's formal name is the United States of Mexico. It has caused no end of
irritation to more independent-minded Mexicans that their overbearing
northern neighbour appropriated part of their country's name.
Now that economic integration with the once loathed Yankees, via the Nafta
trade agreement, is becoming a reality, some leftist politicos are preparing
to do something properly to distinguish their homeland.
If they get their way, Mexico will soon be known as plain Mexico; the
Republic of Mexico; or the Mexican Republic. If that isn't absurd enough, if
their move fails they plan to ask the US to change its name.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Thursday promises to be a red letter day for Britain's arts world. The
225-year-old Royal Academy in Piccadilly, Britain's most exclusive arts
club, assembles to pick a new president to replace Sir Roger de Grey, who
has reached 75, the statutory retiring age.
The voting ritual is arcane. By secret ballot the 80-odd Royal Academicians
can nominate anyone, including themselves. Four votes is all that is needed
to make the next round, then the top two candidates fight it out, leading to
a final confirmatory vote. Before the new president can take over, the RA's
secretary, Piers Rodgers, must phone the Queen for her approval, and Sir
Roger must hand over his golden chain of office on the staircase of
Burlington House.
Since the RA has plans to absorb the adjacent Museum of Mankind and make it
a museum of architecture, an architect would seem an obvious choice. The two
favourites are Cambridge professor Colin St John Wilson, who designed the
new British Library, and Sir Philip Dowson, founder partner of Ove Arup.
Both are over 70, which would be ideal for a stop gap, but the RAs might
want a younger man to raise the cash for the new museum. The spotlight thus
turns on two 56-year-old artists, Tom Phillips, an enthusiastic candidate,
and Allen Jones, who has lived down his past as a pop artist of suggestively
sexist furniture.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Next step for Renault-Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo and Renault are like two lovers who cancelled their wedding on the eve
of the ceremony. Now they have to pick up the pieces of their broken
relationship and see what can be salvaged. This will not be easy. There are
bruised feelings on both sides. Jilted Renault doubts whether it can trust
its Swedish partner. Volvo, on the other hand, is still fearful of being
swamped by the French state-owned company.
But the future need not be as dire as predicted by Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar,
Volvo's ex-chairman and the driving force behind the failed union. In his
resignation statement last week, he said the existing alliance between the
two companies would certainly be dismantled.
Sensibly, both Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, and Mr Soren Gyll,
Volvo's chief executive, have avoided such cataclysmic talk. Both say they
wish to keep the alliance, which consists of a network of
cross-shareholdings and joint projects, alive. The French government also
says it continues to believe a full merger is desirable, while some Swedish
shareholders who opposed the union do not rule out the possibility of it
being revived at a later date.
The current priority is to cool passions and to take a hard look at what is
in the best interests of both companies. That is also essential if the
French and Swedish establishments are to learn the wider lesson from the
break-up: the importance of keeping politics out of business.
On the French side, this means understanding the legitimacy of Swedish
concerns about merging with Renault while it is still state-owned. Until
Renault is privatised, it is impossible for Volvo shareholders to know
whether they were being offered fair value for their shares. The French
government's insistence on maintaining a golden share in Renault also raises
concerns that political interference would continue even after
privatisation.
In the coming years, other state-owned or privatised companies will wish to
form international alliances or mergers. If such arrangements are to
flourish, Paris will need to convince outsiders that the days of political
interference are over.
In Sweden, there is a similar need to disentangle politics from business.
Legitimate concerns over the financial side of the deal were swept up in a
wider debate about Sweden's future in Europe.
Volvo may now be tempted to think that it can go it alone or that its
alliance with Renault can continue indefinitely as it is. This is
self-delusion. Without a partner to share research and development costs and
to gain economies of scale, Volvo's car division has a bleak future. The
same goes for Renault's truck operations. But without trust and a shared
sense of direction, no alliance can prosper.
The only practical alternatives are a complete divorce, which would free
both companies to seek other partners, or a renewed effort at matrimony.
After last week's dramatic events, it is hard to believe that marriage is
still an option. It certainly could not be contemplated until after
Renault's privatisation. But, if both parties could keep politics out of
business, a union would remain the best way forward.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Railtrack asset base must be written
off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof W P BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, How right Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, is to try to establish
sensible financial objectives before he takes over ('Railtrack delays
pricing after row with Treasury', November 30). Previous chairmen of BR have
accepted, without proper consideration, an impossible financial remit and
found themselves taking the blame for inevitable failure.
It is absolute nonsense for the Treasury to argue for replacement cost as a
basis for the valuation of railway track and other infrastructure assets.
Britain's railways mainly carry subsidised passenger trains which do not
even cover their direct operational costs. No asset value is ascribed to the
road network with which the railways compete, neither is a rate of return
set for roads. Many main lines are so dilapidated that they represent not an
asset in Railtrack's books but a liability.
Add to this the vast collection of Victorian architecture where, for
example, the property income at a station like Paddington is entirely
absorbed in the cost of repairing Brunel's roof.
If government is really serious about attracting more freight and passengers
to the railways, eventually privatising Railtrack and stimulating private
sector interest in bidding to operate franchises or finance new rolling
stock, there is a strong case for writing off the whole asset base of
Railtrack. A Pounds 5bn asset base is far too high. A rate of return of 5
per cent might be sought on new commercial investment, where franchisees
could afford to pay, but such a return will be unachievable for most at the
expenditure on the social railway, and for the maintenance of listed
buildings and environmental work.
If government is squeamish about writing off debt, it needs only remind
itself of other privatisations where this has been necessary. Japanese
railways, far busier than ours, needed massive debt write-offs in the run-up
to what appears to be a successful privatisation.
It is a prerequisite of the market investing in franchises, or the building
of new rolling stock for lease, that Railtrack is not dependent upon a vast
annual subsidy, either direct or indirect. This is because such investors
will always believe that the subsidy to Railtrack will be cut, leaving other
railway associated business unviable. Bob Horton has the right target in his
sights. If he doesn't win this battle with the Treasury, he would be better
off going now.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taxation - an anachronistic argument
and a proposed reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J TOPOROWSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender's article is a characteristically thoughtful and
interesting outline of Britain's fiscal crisis. However, among potential
solutions to that crisis, Mr Plender omitted to mention a reform that was
widely canvassed by Michal Kalecki during the late 1930s and early 1940s,
while he was working with Keynes at Cambridge and subsequently at Oxford. In
brief, he proposed a tax on the capital of companies, with generous
allowances for fixed capital investment. This has two important advantages
over the present system of corporate taxation, which taxes profits, with
allowances for investment.
First of all, the present system destabilises government finances because
corporate tax revenue falls, with profits, in a recession when
unemployment-related government expenditure rises. By contrast, a capital
tax with investment allowances would increase government revenue in a
recession because of the decline in investment at such times.
Second, a capital tax with investment allowances would give companies a
strong incentive to invest in a recession. This encourages a sounder,
investment-led recovery. In the long term, it would tend to place the

FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taxation - an anachronistic argument
and a proposed reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF MULGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender's interesting article on taxation ('Revolutionary forces
which will destroy income tax', November 27) unfortunately repeated the
anachronistic Treasury argument against hypothecation: namely that if taxes
are earmarked, spending oscillates in line with the economic cycle rather
than with need. In an era of financial sophistication there is no more
reason why this should be the case for an earmarked tax than for government
revenues as a whole, or indeed for businesses. Any half-way competent chief
executive of the National Health Service receiving an earmarked tranche of
income tax would naturally plan spending and investment to take account of
the business cycle rather than being a slave to the rigidities of the annual
budget.
There are good arguments against hypothecation but, like the oft-repeated
claim that because few people fully understand the uses of national
insurance payments today they could in no way grasp a more transparent and
earmarked tax system, this is not one of them.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Be prepared - and be armed: Patching over differences at the
EU summit will test the Belgian prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The man who will chair the summit of European Union leaders in Brussels at
the end of this week started his career as chief of the Flemish Association
of Catholic Boy Scouts.
If that conjures up a picture of an overgrown schoolboy in shorts, think
again. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious prime minister, is
blunt-talking, stocky and - in the judgment of both allies and enemies -
very tough.
More significantly, Mr Dehaene, 53, will come to the summit on December 10
and 11 as one of the only leaders already trying to implement in his own
country a far-reaching austerity plan. The aim is to improve Belgium's
competitiveness, promote employment and cut the government deficit. Given
that the summit will be seeking solutions to those problems at a European
level, Mr Dehaene's role as chairman will be more than honorific.
'The Belgian government's action is explicitly integrated into the European
context,' Mr Dehaene said last month. 'The plan that the government is
preparing has to be considered as one component of a co-ordinated European
plan, as a contribution to the (European Commission's) white paper (on
growth, competitiveness and employment).'
EU leaders had a taste of Mr Dehaene's no-nonsense chairmanship at October's
special summit in Brussels, when he helped forge agreement on where to
locate the most important new EU institutions, such as the central bank. In
spite of an acrimonious row in the afternoon between Britain and Spain over
the site for the European medicines agency, Mr Dehaene announced a deal in
time for supper.
But this week's summit will have none of the celebratory overtones of the
October meeting, which was called in part to mark the entry into force of
the Maastricht treaty.
It will tackle issues that go to the heart of political differences between
European leaders. Finance ministers gave a flavour of what could be in store
in their first discussion of the Commission's thoughts on the white paper
two weeks ago. The UK and Germany forced Brussels to water down guidelines
for boosting economic growth and halting the rise in unemployment, and other
ministers picked holes in the white paper.
Under such circumstances, Mr Dehaene's experience in wringing compromise out
of feuding parties, regions and linguistic groups in Belgium should stand
him in good stead. 'He's a typical Belgian type of negotiator. These people
are used to hammering out compromises and never giving in,' said one EU
diplomat. 'I think we've already experienced under the Belgian presidency
more late-night sessions than ever before.'
At the same time, the recent talks on a national austerity plan have made
the Belgian prime minister painfully aware of what will be at stake at the
December summit.
Mr Dehaene originally hoped Belgium could climb out of recession with the
help of a 'social pact', which would unite unions, employers and the
centre-left coalition government around a balanced series of measures. As it
was, within 36 hours of the start of formal three-way negotiations at the
end of October, the socialist unions had walked out. In the next three
weeks, he formulated a plan with the socialist and Christian Democrat
members of the coalition.
Under the plan - the most ambitious since the war - real wage increases will
be frozen for the next three years, spending on family allowances,
healthcare and pensions cut by BFr75bn (Pounds 1.4bn), the cost of hiring
labour reduced, and certain indirect taxes increased.
But the unions will not let the prime minister forget that he forged a deal
without them. Union federations aligned with the coalition parties have
carried out rolling strike action to protest against parts of the plan, in
particular cuts in social security and what they consider inadequate
provisions for improving employment. A general strike 10 days ago caused
chaos, and the socialist unions are planning a large demonstration to
coincide with the summit.
Meanwhile, the government is short on popular support. An opinion poll
published a fortnight ago indicated that nearly three-quarters of Belgians
wanted the government to resign. As one Belgian newspaper headline put it:
'Le plan Dehaene seduit la bourse mais deprime la rue' (Dehaene's plan
charms the stock market but depresses the streets).
Economists are already warning that, if the government backs down or breaks
up under such pressure, the limited short-term benefits of the plan's
announcement (a stronger Belgian franc, lower interest rates, rising
equities) will be quickly lost, and the long-term economic consequences
could be catastrophic, with the country's budget deficit spiralling out of
control.
Mr Dehaene has won the support of parliament for a fast-track procedure to
transform the plan into formal legislation, but he is still trying to
placate unions and employers, and this week begins a further round of talks
with the various sides on possible adjustments to the programme. Interviewed
yesterday on Belgian television, he said changes would affect the execution
of the plan, and not the balance of measures. His advisers hope these
amendments will be enough to mollify the plan's opponents without
disillusioning those economists and outside investors who originally
welcomed the programme.
Mr Dehaene is used to such political balancing acts. Since taking over as
prime minister in March 1992, his government has had to produce five
packages of budget measures to curb the deficit. In March, the prime
minister was forced to offer his resignation to the king to persuade his
coalition partners to sign up to further cuts in spending, reinforcing the
impression that he is a strong captain at the head of a weak team. Before
that, he managed to put together a two-thirds majority in the Belgian
parliament - including opposition parties - to vote through constitutional
reforms transforming Belgium into a federal state, with further powers
devolved to its regions.
'He's a little bit of a bulldozer,' said Mr Xavier Mabille, a political
analyst at the Centre de Recherche &amp; d'Information Socio-Politiques in
Brussels. 'But when one sets strong arguments against him, he is
sufficiently intelligent to realise that he has to negotiate.'
For the summit, Mr Dehaene will need his negotiating skills more than his
bulldozing capacity. The task before EU leaders is not to come up with a
programme of legislation, as the Belgian government has done, but to set out
the guidelines for co-ordinated national and European policy.
But at the same time, the Belgian presidency has indicated that it will aim
to strengthen the Commission's growth plans, not dilute them. Given that the
Belgian government is already taking the heat at home for its proposals,
that is not surprising. Mr Dehaene believes the Belgian austerity programme
will make an important contribution to a European plan, but he also sees
Belgium benefiting from a co-ordinated European growth and competitiveness
policy leading to monetary union.
If, as Mr Mabille says, Belgium is 'a little Europe', it is emitting mixed
signals to other EU leaders still agonising over budget cuts. When he opens
the summit on Friday, Mr Dehaene will almost certainly have to explain away
demonstrating workers on the streets outside the conference chamber, play
down the consequent unpopularity of his coalition, and provide evidence of
his government's will to implement all of the austerity plan.
But he will also be armed, unlike many of his counterparts, with concrete
evidence of how his country is trying to confront the larger problems facing
the Union. Like all good scouts, he will be prepared.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Training must match best
international standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K J JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is good to see, as David Goodhart says ('Training moves up the
political agenda', December 2), that training is moving up the political
agenda. In engineering we welcome this renewed interest and we at EnTra -
the Engineering Training Authority - together with our colleagues at the
Engineering Employers' Federation, have responded enthusiastically to
employment secretary David Hunt's approach. We are looking forward to the
more detailed consultative process which will ensure that the initiative is
much more significant than just a new vocational training wheeze.
There is, however, one matter on which we should not be misled. There was a
sharp decline in the number of apprenticeships in the early 1980s, but this
was not only due to the abolition of most of the industry training boards.
The Engineering Industry Training Board, our predecessor, was only abolished
in July 1991 and the Construction Industry Training Board still retains its
statutory role.
The reform of vocational training is universally seen as a key to the
nation's economic success. We need to ensure that the quality and the
quantity of training undertaken match the best in international standards.
We shall only do that if we can win the commitment and support of both
employers and individuals.
We shall not be helped if we do not address the other reasons for the slump
of apprenticeship training in the 1980s.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Time the pessimists ate their hats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the hazards of being a reporter, especially a foreign correspondent,
is that you have no control over headline writers. In more than three years
of reporting on the US economy I have detected a subtle bias. Gripped by
Euro-pessimism, the London-based subeditors are reluctant to believe any
part of the globe is enjoying a strong recovery.
On Friday I thought I had them finally on the run. A drop in the jobless
rate from 6.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent - the biggest in a decade - would
surely convince even the sceptics of Number One Southwark Bridge that the US
economy was on a roll. By no means. 'Big fall in US jobless lifts hopes of
robust recovery' was the most that could be squeezed from the still-cautious
news desk.
The stark difference in the economic performance of the US and Europe is
still not fully appreciated in Britain. America has not been grappling with
the worst recession since the 1930s. It had only a mild and brief downturn
during the Gulf war. It has since enjoyed 10 consecutive quarters of
expansion. The annual rate of growth has averaged 3 per cent in real terms
during the last seven quarters and seems likely to reach 4-5 per cent this
quarter.
But to be fair to FT headline writers, their perception of events mirrors
that of Main Street America. George Bush lost last year's election because
he could not convince voters the economy was truly reviving. The problem was
that growth was slower than in most previous recoveries, and alarmingly
erratic.
With hindsight, nobody should have complained about the last three quarters
of 1992, which registered annual growth rates of 2.8 per cent, 3.4 per cent
and 5.7 per cent. But then came the payback. The first three quarters of the
Clinton presidency saw growth of only 0.8 per cent, 1.9 per cent and 2.7 per
cent: miserable by US standards.
The conventional view is that this saw-tooth pattern will continue. Growth
will therefore moderate early next year, although not as abruptly as at the
beginning of this year. The consumer is expected to retrench because
spending has outstripped personal incomes, pushing down the savings rate to
3.7 per cent against an average of 5.3 per cent last year. Factory output,
meanwhile, is less robust than it looks because of an unsustainable surge in
car production after a weak third quarter. Familiar villains - weak exports
and defence cuts - will continue to exert their negative pull.
There is solid logic behind such arguments. But they seem a trifle
pessimistic. The economy has worked its way through the financial problems
of the late 1980s. Debt ratios are down in both the personal and corporate
sectors. Banks are lending again. Commercial property values have
stabilised. The barometer is thus now set fair for a more normal expansion.
Monetary policy has been highly stimulative for more than a year. The
magnitude of the boost from lower rates, especially on longer-dated
securities, should not be underestimated. Rate-sensitive sectors of the
economy, such as housing, consumer durables and business investment, are
booming. Personal income figures do not allow for big sums released by
refinancing mortgages at lower rates and thus understate consumers' buying
power.
The employment outlook has been quietly transformed. Some 1.6m jobs have
been created so far this year, twice the rate in 1992 when the economy grew
by 2.8 per cent. This is what lies behind the surge in consumer confidence
reported last week - one of the biggest in 25 years.
The rapid growth of this quarter could thus persist well into next year.
Indeed, even if the old saw-tooth pattern repeats itself, two or three
quarters of above-trend growth would be more likely than a solitary strong
quarter. After producing a stream of over-optimistic forecasts in recent
years, US forecasters are on the brink of making the opposite mistake. Now
that the constraints on growth have finally been lifted, they are unable to
celebrate the dawn.
The relative pessimism about growth is prompting a second mistake:
complacency about inflation. US analysts, despite the much greater buoyancy
of the American economy, are beginning to adopt the Euro-pessimist view of
inflation. It is dead, finished, caput. Anybody who fails to recognise that
prices are dormant is simply out of touch with reality, a relic from the
1970s.
Perhaps inflation is 'yesterday's fight'. Perhaps the 'long wave' view of
economic activity is correct. After the inflationary headaches of the 1970s
and 1980s, maybe the world has entered a glorious new era of stable prices.
All I can say is that this view looks less plausible in an economy that has
not been flirting with depression. (I suspect it looks less credible still
in regions that are growing even faster than the US, such as China and the
rest of east Asia.)
In the short run, the recent sharp fall in oil prices will improve an
already promising inflation outlook. Upward pressure on US wages and
producer prices remains low. But this is the stage of the business cycle
when policymakers always drop their guard. It may not be time for the US to
apply the monetary brakes, but it is time to stop pressing the monetary
accelerator. If Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gradually
raises rates from 3 per cent to, say, 4.5 per cent, he will be moving from
stimulus to a neutral stance.
We take out insurance against events we hope will never occur. It is in this
spirit that Mr Greenspan should be preparing to rein in his monetary
stimulus. If he does so, he may be the first Fed chairman in decades to
preside over a faster rate of economic growth than inflation.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: An appealing Tosca - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advent of Anna Tomowa-Sintow and Sergey Leiferkus as Tosca and Scarpia
in the Royal Opera's umpteenth revival of Puccini's opera on Saturday
brought a reminder that we were supposed to be hearing them as Yaroslavna
and Prince Igor. Or, put another way, they had been engaged to sing in the
first revival of Borodin's Prince Igor until Baroness Warnock intervened on
behalf of the Arts Council and recommended the substitution of interesting
rarities with popular runs.
At a time when the Arts Council is preparing to abandon further
responsibilities, it was particularly irksome to be reminded of this loss.
But any opportunity to hear Tomowa-Sintow and Leiferkus - both making role
debuts at Covent Garden - is always welcome.
The Russian baritone, surely now at his peak, lifted what was already a
well-sung performance on to an altogether higher plain: he is a mesmerising
actor and every gesture counts - here his police chief oozed malevolence -
but above all it is his vocal characterisation that makes his portrayals so
compelling. His dark, burnished tone was always focused, the line musically
moulded.
Anna Tomowa-Sintow may not be an obvious Tosca, but this was an appealing
performance. Though she looks a touch matronly, her voice remains beautiful
and steady. Her 'Vissi d'arte' had a disarming honesty about it.
Alberto Cupido's Cavaradossi is familiar to London audiences. He cuts a
credible figure and sings generously; at times, though, pitch and tone got
squeezed at the top.
The smaller roles were carefully observed.
Mark Beesley made a desperate Angelotti, and Eric Garrett - though prone to
some overacting - an amusing Sacristan. None of the performers allowed this
old-fashioned and traditional staging - Zeffirelli created the original for
Maria Callas 29 years ago, and it was revised by John Cox in 1991 - to look
tired.
Edward Downes was making a welcome appearance in the pit. His reading was
broad, securely paced, so musical that one almost forgot Prince Igor was
missing.
But Borodin's opera is still impatiently awaited, and bringing it back must
now be put high on the Royal Opera's agenda.
Further performances:
December 7, 10, 13, 16 and 18

FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: Jacobeans revisited - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacobean, Tudor and Elizabethan are the styles that are back in favour. Not
with architects (at least not yet) but with architectural writers and
historians. They are periods that have been curiously neglected and this
year's crop of books does a lot to rectify the situation.
One book stands out: The Royal Palaces of Tudor England by Simon Thurley
(Yale University Press, 284 pages, Pounds 29.95) covers the period between
1450 and 1550 and is an informative and good-looking book. Thurley is
Curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Agency and has been responsible for
refurbishment of the Tudor kitchens at Hampton Court Palace and the repair
and restoration of the King's Apartments after the Hampton Court fire of
1986. At the Tower of London he has guided the 're-creation' of the Royal
Lodgings of King Edward I.
When King Henry VIII died in 1547 in his palace in Whitehall he was the
proud possessor of more than 60 houses. Thurley charts their history, giving
new insight into the social history of the court. Not all the houses were
palaces: they were a mixture of the royal desire for magnificence and a less
powerful one for privacy. In architectural terms the now lost palace of
Nonsuch remains the richest example of Henry VIII's sophisticated and
sumptuous European taste. Hampton Court naturally dominates the book with
its incessant heraldic decoration and complex plan. With Thurley's brilliant
choice of illustrations, from plans to paintings, it is possible to imagine
a world of cloth of gold, Turkey rugs and tapestries that was almost
Oriental in its imperial glorification of the monarch.
Elizabethan and Jacobean Style by Timothy Mowl (Phaidon Press, 240 pages,
Pounds 29.95) is a book that gives the reader the broader stylistic
background to the period from the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558 to
the death of King James I in 1625. It is marvellous for two reasons. First,
Mowl is that rare thing, an architectural historian who can write. Second,
he is a man with a new thesis who challenges the orthodox view.
The victim of Mowl's views is Inigo Jones, no longer seen as the inspired
orderer of English classicism but as 'an insidious courtier' who imprisoned
the brilliant English imagination in a set of dull rules and petrified the
progress of the English Renaissance. The great Elizabethan and Jacobean
houses have an aesthetic richness and visual vigour that is unique, but Mowl
is right to point out that we have been conditioned to look away from their
apparent vulgarity and soothe ourselves in a cool bath of classicism. In
fact a house such as Bolsover is as good as any palace in Mantua or Urbino.
The truly Shakespearean richness of the architecture of this period has been
ignored for too long. The Victorians loved it and copied it and perhaps were
responsible for this century's extreme reaction against its complexity and
almost pagan splendour.
Mowl concentrates on the grander manifestations of the English Renaissance
style and passes quickly over the black and white half timbered architecture
 -still, I suspect too close to stockbroker Tudor to be studied closely. But
he does widen his field to look at silverware and tapestries and draws our
attention to one of the richest veins of European sculpture throughout
England during this period in the elaborate tombs and church monuments. The
sense of allegory and meaning is something we have lost from architecture,
our senses irreparably dimmed by modernism. This vigorous and profoundly
English book will inspire any reader to look again at this period with pure
joy. There is a gazetteer at the back of all the houses that are open to the
public.
When it comes to palaces, the City of London's own Mansion House is
curiously little known. One of the great town palaces of London, it has a
well documented history and has recently been completely restored and
refurbished by the City Corporation at no modest cost. This book is the
result of six years of research made for this refurbishment. The Mansion
House by Sally Jeffery (Phillimore Pounds 75, 352 pages) is a handsome,
expensive volume that will be the perfect banker's gift for his Japanese
clients.
It explains in well illustrated detail the history of the house's 250-year
life and has a section on the recent restoration. The Mansion House,
designed by George Dance the Elder and altered by George Dance the Younger,
still has some of the best mid-18th century interiors in the country. Like
all palaces, it was built for entertainment and the City maintains there an
elaborate tradition of hospitality.
This official book tells the tale of the building and furnishing of the
house with relentless thoroughness. But it does raise one question. Now that
the monarch opens her London Palace to the public, why is the Mansion House
not regularly opened when the Lord Mayor is away? For the time being this
book is the best informed tour of the house that is available, but it can
only be a substitute for the real thing.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: On a long road to the promised land - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It comes as a shock to be reminded that Strindberg wrote 65 plays - how few
of them one has read or seen. The Great Highway, written in 1909, was his
last and remains one of his best-known works. It is now revived in all its
sombre, northern splendour at the Gate Theatre in London's Notting Hill - an
appropriate venue because the refurbished Gate seems designed for plays
about mental anguish.
Let me include a caveat before praising it. The Great Highway seems to me
much more a dramatic poem than a piece for the stage.
It is written in, at times, extraordinarily striking blank verse. There are
echoes of Ibsen's Peer Gynt and sometimes Brand. For here is a wayward
preacher looking back at his past in a place never wholly defined. There are
scenes of dramatic action, to be sure, but it is almost impossible to get
away from this central character, who must be Strindberg himself.
The location looks like somewhere between heaven and north of Stockholm. A
signpost at the start has arms pointing in two directions: one up, one down.
Whether these are the way to paradise and the way to perdition is unclear.
Equally ambiguous is whether the Strindberg character, described simply as
the hunter, is trying to get back from the higher reaches to the lower or
the other way round. Possibly it is a bit of both. It is clear enough,
however, that this is the painful survey of one man's life.
The great highway was real: it was the new road being built from the Swedish
capital, to which Strindberg had returned, to the north of the country. (In
England we would have called it the great north road.) It is also full of
symbolism. Biblical images abound. 'Is this the way to the promised land?' a
traveller asks, only to be told: 'This is the straight way.' Thus presumably
it is not the only way. There can be lots of stops and dalliances en route.
Nor is religion the whole of the play. 'What's to the north?' the hunter
asks at the beginning. 'A cliff of slate, a cloud like a schoolroom
blackboard as yet unwritten on.' Education and humanism must have been just
as central. And there is one most peculiar fact. Strindberg in his
wanderings introduces an old dying Japanese man. 'I have travelled, sinned,
and suffered by the name 'Hiroshima' after my native town,' he says. No
wonder some people claim Strindberg was prophetic.
The last, poignant line of the play says it all: 'I could not be the one I
longed to be.' The hunter is magisterially played by Sylvester Morand. The
direction and design by David Farr and Angela Davies respectively are full
of surgical Scandinavian precision, but I still think it is more of an epic
poem than a play.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: Calling on corporates - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arts sponsorship was one of the rare beneficiaries from Tuesday's Budget.
The heritage minister, Peter Brooke, found another Pounds 300,000 to add to
the Pounds 4.5m he gives each year to fund the Business Sponsorship
Incentive Scheme, which provides matching government grants to imaginative
corporate sponsors.
The BSIS is a perfect example of government arts policy, which is designed
to reward those arts organisations which are successful at helping
themselves by attracting new sources of revenue. Since 1984 the government
has invested Pounds 23.7m in the BSIS but this has produced Pounds 48.3m in
new sponsorship for the arts.
The extra cash reflects government concern at this year's faltering
corporate sponsorship. Last month the annual survey by the Association for
Business Sponsorship of the Arts revealed a 13 per cent fall to Pounds
57.7m. With Arts Council and local authority funding of the arts certain to
fall in 1994 the government needs business sponsors to keep the theatres
working, the orchestras playing, and the art galleries open - so much for
sponsorship being icing on the cake.
ABSA is likely to use some of the additional cash to open another regional
office, in Birmingham or Exeter. Its office in Halifax has contributed
greatly to the massive expansion in arts sponsorship in the north of
England.
Two great preoccupations of the sponsorship world at the moment are media
recognition and event evaluation. In these hard times companies need to know
that the money they invest in the arts brings them tangible returns.
Shareholders and employees are suspicious of sponsorships that provide
little but the warm glow of disinterested patronage.
So there will be many expectant faces at the Royal National Theatre on
Thursday when the Princess of Wales announces the ABSA/Arthur Andersen
Awards for the companies that have made the most imaginative use of arts
sponsorship in the past year. It is the one occasion at which captains of
industry mingle happily with an abundance of arts worthies. For the winners
this is the event that justifies expenditure.
Flicking through the nominations there are two noticeable developments - a
larger presence by northern based companies; and more small, lesser known
sponsors.
On the short list is first-time sponsor Boddingtons, the Manchester-based
brewer which backs the Manchester Festival of Arts &amp; Television. It is up
against the Halifax Building Society, sponsor of Eureka], the childrens'
museum in Halifax, and Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour, which supports Merseyside
Museums. The only outsider is equally exotic - Generale des Eaux, the French
sponsor of the Croydon-based London Mozart Players.
The best corporate programme category also has a northern bias, setting
English Estates (best known for its RSC support) against Manchester Airport
(a major backer of the Halle orchestra and the Royal Exchange Theatre) and
the Royal Bank of Scotland. The lone London-based candidate is Lloyds Bank,
which with its Fashion, Theatre and Film Challenges for young people, as
well as the Young Musician of the Year, is investing Pounds 2m in the arts
next year and rivalling BT as the UK's biggest arts sponsor.
Among the more intriguing contests is that for sponsorship by a small
business. Here a Chinese restaurant, Kar Ling Kwong of Leatherhead, which
backs the local Redgrave Theatre, is up against Forward Publishing,
publishers of poetry and nominated by Book Trust, and Robert Golden
Pictures, which makes commercials and which has aided Opera Circus,
neighbours in London's Doughty Mews.
The awards could be one of the last official appearances by the Princess of
Wales at an arts occasion, following her decision to relinquish public
support for many charities. Many arts companies, like the Welsh National
Opera, English National Ballet and London City Ballet, will lose a very
important sponsorship attraction as a result.
With companies reluctant these days to invest in big block-buster
sponsorships the Tate, like many arts organisations, is attempting to
increase its corporate members.  It has Pounds 25,000 a year for private
access to the Tate's galleries.  Double this number and the Tate could be
almost Pounds 500,000 more financially secure.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: Die Fledermaus - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An opera producer with a sense of humour is usually worth the price of a
ticket. Among the new breed of British producers who came to the fore in the
1980s, Richard Jones is the one most likely to be found with a smile on his
face. Even in heavyweight Wagnerian music dramas he cannot resist tickling
the audience's ribs occasionally.
Unfortunately, it was a loud raspberry from the press which greeted his
production of Die Fledermaus two years ago. So often operettas in the care
of English National Opera have succumbed to what one might call the London
Coliseum treatment: play it big, play it brash, play it vulgar. By all
accounts Jones did all three and threw in a bare bottom as the final insult.
The reviews may have been awful, but at least the photos made page three.
Now the opera is back and for this revival the company has taken the
precaution of covering its posterior. As I did not see the show the first
time round, I cannot say what else has changed, but clearly a re-think has
managed to turn this Die Fledermaus into a more disciplined evening.
Forget Vienna, 1874, whatever the calendar on Colonel Frank's prison wall
might say. This production has never been nearer to Austria than the end of
Brighton pier and is content if it can get a laugh by mentioning Sachertorte
and having people say 'Auf wiedersehen'.
Indeed, the first act works desperately hard to raise any laughter at all,
but when the curtain goes up on the second, Jones's sense of the ridiculous
starts to work. The crazy staircase, the sloping dining-tables from which
the candelabra never slide off, the 25-foot chaise longue are all zany,
off-centre fun.
It is down that ludicrously extended sofa that Geoffrey Dolton's Eisenstein
crawls, rolls and somersaults in a virtuoso performance, as he tries to
seduce his own wife. The comic energy is unstinting and he really seems an
'all-round good egg', as somebody remarks. Vivian Tierney's Rosalinda is
made up as a Jean Harlow lookalike and behaves about as much in period, but
she sings well, the Czardas apart.
As a spirited, red-haired Adele, Rosemary Joshua reveals some sparkling top
notes, but keeps her bottom under wraps. Richard Suart is a less bumbling
Colonel Frank than usual; Paul Napier-Burrows has enough voice, but possibly
not enough personality for Dr Falke. Nobody enjoys himself more than Anthony
Mee as Alfred the tenor, his accent now North-of-Watford, now Italian
Riviera. Therese Feighan is the nicely pale new Orlofsky, Nigel Planer an
alternative comic Frosch.
There were moments in the overture when it seemed the music might grind to a
halt - surely Straussian rubato is meant to be the musical equivalent of a
comma, not a full stop? - but Jerzy Maksymiuk did eventually get the show on
the road. It seemed shorter than Die Fledermaus often does. If the dialogue
had been cut, that is no loss. The translation does not exactly sparkle with
champagne wit.
Performances continue until February 10.

These days a new business guru with a miracle wheeze seems to turn up every
month, promising that our entire world is about to be revolutionised by
magnetic string or the power of diagonal thinking or some such malarkey.
Today in Crazy Ways For Crazy Days BBC2 shows guru Tom Peters addressing a
London seminar and declaring 'I'm not talking skill enhancement, I'm talking
everyone in this room, everyone on this island, needing to learn totally new
stuff in the next 60 months'. He is American, of course. Still, he certainly
seems to have his own business skills sorted out: the BBC is promoting his
video, price Pounds 395 plus VAT (7.20).
Ken Livingstone claims that when asked to play himself, in tonight's episode
of the embarrassingly naff Woman's Guide To Adultery on ITV, he specified
'No nude scenes with Amanda Donohoe'. How politically correct can you get?

FT  06 DEC 93 / People: Tabuchi emerges from hiding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Setsuya Tabuchi, former chairman of Nomura Securities, finally coming out
of hiding, asks Emiko Terazono. Otherwise known as 'Big Tabuchi', the man
who was once king of Japan's securities industry, has been lying low since
he was forced to resign in mid-1991 following the spate of securities
scandals.
However, many in the financial community see his meeting with prime minister
Morihiro Hosokawa last Tuesday, when the stock market plunged to a year's
low, as a prelude to his return to power. This return visit has encouraged
investors, and the Nikkei average has since perked up slightly, helped by
reports that Big Tabuchi was advising Hosokawa.
Tabuchi, currently an adviser to Nomura, has been waiting to prove he has
not lost his touch. He has been entertaining prominent politicians and
officials of various countries, including Lady Thatcher.
He says he only advised Hosokawa that public funds should be used to help
the country's ailing banks with their non-performing loans. It was probably
valid advice for leading politicians, many of whom have extensive
shareholdings.

FT  06 DEC 93 / People: Retail banker moves up at First Chicago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leo Mullin, the 50-year-old Harvard-educated banker recently named as
president of First Chicago Corporation, has thus become heir-apparent to
First Chicago chairman Richard Thomas, the engineer of a remarkable
turnround over the past two years at the US's eleventh largest bank, writes
Laurie Morse.
Mullin's first task will be to convince Wall Street, and the ranks of First
Chicago's institutional bankers, that despite his history as a retail
banker, he will maintain the bank's successful balance of retail and global
corporate banking activities. First Chicago, after a decade of mishaps and
disappointing returns, is now profitable and poised for growth.
Mullin's promotion not only paves the way for an orderly succession to
Thomas, who must retire in 1996, but suggests that the bank plans to expand
through retail bank acquisitions. Mullin came to First Chicago 12 years ago
as a strategic planner and ended up directing the corporation's retail
banking activities.
He has plenty of experience of producing healthy businesses out of turnround
situations. He is credited with preserving First Chicago's credit card
portfolio in the early 1980s. A loss-maker at the time, the credit card
division is now one of the bank's biggest profit centres.
Before joining First Chicago, Mullin spent nine years at McKinsey, where he
helped forge Conrail out of a handful of failed eastern freight carriers.
Mullin claims he fully understands the bank's balance of business. 'My job
is to develop a strategy for the entire corporation,' he says. 'We have as
much upside in corporate banking as anywhere else.'
Still, he is keen to keep First Chicago a leader in its home market. Barely
a week after his promotion, First Chicago announced it would acquire Lake
Shore Bancorp, a local institution with Dollars 1.2bn in assets and
headquarters on Chicago's posh Michigan Avenue for Dollars 323m in stock.
First Chicago's share price fell after the deal, which analysts viewed as
pricy. However, Mullin says the purchase makes strategic sense and that
First Chicago should grow aggressively in all its divisions.

FT  06 DEC 93 / People: A proponent of brown coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are tough times for Manfred Stolpe, prime minister of Brandenburg,
which has the only social democratic-led government in eastern Germany,
writes Judy Dempsey. As an easterner and former head of the Evangelical
Church in east Berlin and Brandenburg, Stolpe has been hounded for his
alleged connections with the Stasi. As a politician, he must answer for the
state's level of unemployment which officially exceeds 17 per cent.
Brandenburgers yesterday voted in the state's first local government
elections since unification, but Stolpe, born in 1936 in Szczecin, then in
Germany but now in Poland, is determined to set his sights on next year's
state and federal elections. Success in two key sectors of Brandenburg's
economy - brown coal and steel - could ensure him another term. The going
will be tough.
The economic viability of the giant Laubag mines, which the Treuhand
privatisation agency is selling, depends on producing 55m tonnes a year.
That would secure 12,000 jobs, a fifth of pre-unification times. The problem
Stolpe faces is a growing rebellion from the cities which want to switch
away from lignite to clean gas.
'I am convinced we can make brown coal competitive. The fact that Britain's
PowerGen and the Americans are buying Mibrag (lignites fields in
Saxony-Anhalt) is a signal that brown coal has a future, and a clean one at
that,' he says.
Keeping afloat Ekostahl, one of the region's largest steel plants, will not
be easy. The Treuhand is negotiating its sale to Riva, the Italian steel
manufacturer. But the European Union is questioning the level of subsidies
involved in turning the plant into a mini-mill. 'We hope the EU will support
us,' says Stolpe. 'The subsidies will not be needed indefinitely. There are
markets in eastern Europe, Ukraine and Russia for Ekostahl's products.'
If Stolpe could secure a future for Brandenburg's brown coal and steel, the
burghers might secure him a political future too. If so, it would prove that
an Ossi, or easterner, can ride the storm.

FT  06 DEC 93 / People: Seeking a secure future in Japan - Robert Thomson
explains why Yoshihiko Miyauchi is embarking on a sales tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next few days, Yoshihiko Miyauchi will be encouraging international
investors to sit back, relax and let thoughts of sell orders drift from
their mind. Miyauchi will be visiting the UK and US to deliver a sales spiel
to investors in his role as president of Orix, the Japanese leasing and
financial services company.
But the timing means that he will be speaking for more than just his
company.
The message he brings from the Tokyo stock market will not be comforting.
The market has swung alarmingly in the past two weeks with the government
under mounting pressure to deliver another stimulus to the ailing economy
and to prop up stock prices. As Miyauchi puts it: 'Maybe we will be peeping
at hell next year. The government must intervene to encourage more
transactions. It has happened in Europe and the US, but in this country it
takes a longer time to get a consensus.'
Miyauchi moves easily between the worlds of politics and finance. He
apparently has a good friendship with prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He
also carries influence within the Ministry of Finance, which is often
unsympathetic to the so-called non-banks such as Orix.
Miyauchi, 58, is linked with Hosokawa in Japanese minds because he is one of
the relatively young executives who did not endure the slow climb through
the corporate hierarchy, which would only have allowed him four years at the
top at an advanced age. He has been president since 1980. His success has
entitled him to a long reign.
Orix reflects its president's unconventional character. Large Japanese
companies are cossetted by cosy cross-shareholdings with other groups. Only
a tiny proportion of their shares are owned by foreigners.
By contrast, 27 per cent of Orix is held outside Japan, prompting Miyauchi's
taking to the road to soothe frayed nerves.
'Foreign shareholders sometimes do not buy the company itself; they buy
countries together with companies. They don't always look at the bottom
line. If they lose confidence in Japan, they tend to sell regardless of the
company. That is happening now,' says Miyauchi, who uses his hands for
emphasis more than do most Japanese executives.
These are difficult times for Japanese financial companies, and Miyauchi
will choose his words carefully while on tour. Four years after the peak in
Japanese stock prices, the market is still vulnerable to sudden falls which
can reverse months of gradual gains. The latest dive came with the
realisation that the banking system was still creaking under the weight of
bad loans, made during the bubble era of the late 1980s.
That has left Japan's mainstream banks under a cloud but there are deeper
fears about non-banks, as financial companies such as Miyauchi's Orix are
known.
Miyauchi presides over an extended Orix family of companies. The names of
subsidiaries stretch over five pages in the annual report. At the core is
equipment leasing and consumer finance, then there is aircraft leasing, a
securities house, the Orix Collection of fine art, a professional baseball
team (the Orix Blue Wave), a car rental company, and a joint venture
consumer finance company in Shanghai, which will give Chinese shoppers their
first credit rating.
'We have very tight control over group companies. We know what has been
happening, especially in the real estate divisions. I am watching the
problem loans day-to-day and the problem ventures,' Miyauchi says. 'We have
one or two problems in golf courses and resorts. We have already done our
best and things are moving forward. They will not be profitable but they
will be viable.'
He says Orix was the first financial company to tackle non-performing loans,
three years ago, though the group's allowance for loan losses fell 3.7 per
cent over the year to September, when Japanese banks sharply increased their
loan loss provisions. Measuring the Orix exposure is not easy. But it was
not exempted from some of the more exotic transactions of the bubble years
of the stock market. One member of the family, Orix Alpha, was a lender to
Nui Onoue, the infamous woman from Osaka, who used seances for investment
advice and presented forged deposit receipts as collateral.
The cause of the financial system's lingering ailments is not eccentric
stock speculators, but the aggressive lending to the property industry, made
painful by a fall in land values and the draining of liquidity from the
market. Miyauchi believes demand for residential property could recover but
he believes the commercial market is a 'disaster'. The worst is yet to come,
he warns.
Confident enough to handle an interview in English, he received an MBA from
the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1960. His interests appear to have
become as diverse as his company, which he joined in 1964 on its formation.
He bemoans Japanese financial companies' inability to follow the lead of its
manufacturing companies, such as Sony, which have a track record for
innovating world class products.
He says: 'The Japanese economy has become a world power by the power of
manufacturing. If you look at the financial sectors, we have a huge amount
of funds available, but we have not created any financial service
transactions which can be used in other parts of the world. We try to import
everything and in many cases the government tries to stop it.'
Well connected Miyauchi may be, but Japanese and foreign financial companies
struggle to get approval from a conservative finance ministry for new
products. After several years of negotiation, Orix became the first non-bank
in July to issue commercial paper, giving non-banks more flexibility in
raising finance when Japanese banks are wary of fresh lending.
Miyauchi's flexibility is rare in Japanese financial circles. But that does
not mean he lacks other more traditional Japanese business characteristics,
such as patience, which has been one of the hallmarks of its approach to
China.
The company formed the first joint venture leasing company in Beijing in
1981, and the Shanghai consumer finance deal came after Orix had cultivated
contacts for more than a decade.
'China is very, very difficult. It changes very quickly. I ask myself
whether it is taking off,' he says. 'People are eager to have a better life.
Now they would like more money. That is a big incentive for anyone to become
a more economically-aware human being.'
Dealing with foreign fund managers should be easier than convincing Chinese
cadres to have faith in Orix.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Management: Five principles for an organised day - Tips from
the top James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, offers advice on ways to
manage time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to Tom Peters, the management guru, there are only two kinds of
managers in the nanosecond 1990s - the quick and the dead.
That may sound trite but it contains more than a grain of truth. A recent
survey by Management Today painted a worrying picture of men and women
working under extreme pressure. More than 80 per cent of respondents to the
survey complained of incompetent senior management, poor internal
communications, time pressure, constant interruptions and unrealistic
business objectives.
As today's pressures mean a continual drive to add more value with less
people, the manager's work is increasingly becoming a source of stress as
well as satisfaction.
Time management starts with a clear definition of goals and priorities and
continues with the organisation of all activities around them. Pareto's Law
applies to time management, too. Some 80 per cent of your results are going
to flow out of 20 per cent of your activities.
There are many pressures which lead to wasteful use of time - meetings that
should not be on the agenda, social events that need not be attended and
tasks that should be delegated.
Time can also be wasted if a company's organisational structure is not
balanced and the span of managerial control is too wide. That comes back to
picking competent people, listening to them and ensuring that they are
empowered to do their job. Correcting mistakes and repeating tasks is
unproductive. Encourage those you control to get it right - first time, on
time, every time.
We all complain about meetings but they are vital to the completion of tasks
in an organisation. Always question the need for your presence and watch out
for that insidious corporate art - upward delegation.
As a chairman of a meeting, you are its referee and leader. You must keep it
on track, ensure that only the relevant people attend, summarise decisions
and make sure all participants are aware of the implications of these
decisions including the actions which are required of them.
If you are chairman of the board, estimate the time each agenda item is
likely to take. It's much better to deal thoroughly with four or five items
and come to clear and well-understood decisions, than to deal
unsatisfactorily with eight.
And then there is that great corporate comfort blanket, the diary. We've all
become used to its tyranny but it can be one of our most flexible business
tools. A productive diary is one which has a lot of space in it. You may not
be able to predict the future but at least you can leave time to deal with
it. And don't leave it entirely to your secretary.
Thinking ahead is a must. Plan each week carefully and take a few minutes
each morning to review the day's work and to set realistic objectives for
yourself. Be prepared to fail. If you find you are transferring a task from
week to week, then perhaps it would be better delegated.
Travel time can be used to great effect. Not only for thinking but also for
working. If you are fortunate enough to be driven from engagement to
engagement then you can virtually set up office in the car with a mobile
telephone and a memo tape.
In the UK, there is a deep-seated cultural distaste for working at home.
There is a clear psychological division between office and home. That
division will become increasingly blurred with the kind of communication
improvements available now, though that doesn't mean we all need to turn
into workaholics.
Here are my five principles of good time management.
Set goals for your business and your private life and make sure they are
realistic.
Question every action. If you feel you should not be doing something then
delegate.
Don't be a slave to your diary or any other office system - get them working
for you.
Leave time in your day to think and plan - and to listen.
Finally, recognise your own limitations - you're only human.
Next Monday: Liam Strong of Sears on keeping yourself briefed.

Most consultants these days will tell you that Total Quality Management  -
one of the most pervasive business tools of the 1980s - has been eclipsed by
other 'big ideas'.
If they are right, today's formal launch of the new British Quality
Foundation - under the chairmanship Sir Denys Henderson of ICI - looks
rather oddly timed. It begs the question why heavyweight industrialists such
as Peter Bonfield of ICL, Michael Hepher of British Telecom, Michael Heron
of the Post Office, and Ken Sanders of Texas Instruments have joined Sir
Denys on the BQF's beefed up board.
The answer is that TQM - the gospel of focusing the attention of everyone in
an organisation on the customer - is proving unexpectedly durable. Take last
week's TQM conference in Paris organised by Renault and its then would-be
merger partner Volvo, which attracted more than 1,000 executives on top of a
veritable army of delegates from the two car companies. TQM may not yet have
taken root in Europe in the same way that it has in the US and Japan - but
the message from the Paris gathering is that a large and probably growing
number of European companies still senses that quality is a vital part of
management's search for the Holy Grail.
Among those there to reaffirm their faith on the same platform were Paul
Allaire, chairman and chief executive of the US Xerox Corporation, Bernard
Fournier, chief executive of Rank Xerox (in which the US parent has a 51 per
cent stake), and Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman and chief executive of Fuji
Xerox (a joint venture between Fuji Photo Film and Rank Xerox). These
companies have been banging the quality drum for a decade now, but it was
interesting to hear Allaire say that it took until 1989 for the TQM
philosophy to percolate right through the ranks.
The Xerox bosses spoke about the challenge of keeping TQM fresh - one reason
perhaps why they took the unusual step of all attending the same bash; they
also drew on the group's international 'reach' to demonstrate that TQM can
be adapted to local conditions.
Henderson, who admits he used to be a touch cynical about TQM, now confesses
to being 'a complete convert'. He describes it as 'a way of making better
products at a better price, ensuring that even the shopfloor worker is aware
of the customer'.
The BQF, which has been given pump priming money and strong moral support by
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, aims to promote a wider
understanding of TQM. But its most ambitious project will be launching a new
UK quality award scheme, closely based on the approach of the European
Foundation for Quality Management which in turn was inspired by the famous
US Baldrige award.
'National awards are seen as a means of digging down into the smaller
business,' says Malcolm Franks, ICI's group commerical manager. He has been
seconded to the BQF as its first chief executive.

<TEXT>
Is total quality management just a passing fad of dubious practical value,
or does it improve corporate performance so much that it will become a
standard business practice?
That is the question posed by the Conference Board, the independent US
business policy organisation, in a recent report* which tries to pull
together some common threads from 20 studies, many of them previously
unpublished.
The sources include studies sponsored by the Conference Board itself, as
well as management consultants such as Booz Allen and Ernst &amp; Young, and an
in-house probe conducted by IBM.
Critics argue that TQM might not be as effective as initially thought, or
could even be damaging to a company's performance if poorly implemented.
The Conference Board study, however, reaches a cautiously optimistic
conclusion: 'Most managers at companies using TQM say it does work, but some
say it hasn't been very helpful.' In other words, TQM works, but with
qualifications.
The report says that TQM efforts are still increasing at US companies
through techniques that include continuous process improvement, just-in-time
manufacturing, teamwork, benchmarking, statistical process control and
employee participation.
A majority of firms in the studies' samples have started TQM only in the
past two years - and industrial companies have adopted it more commonly than
service ones.
The report says most of the studies suggest that TQM can improve company
performance on measures including market share, customer satisfaction,
employee performance, process costs, cycle time, profits and return on
investment.
'However, they do not show that every company trying TQM methods will
quickly achieve progress on each measure.' The Conference Board reckons that
a firm's success in adopting TQM is related to the specific combination of
techniques it applies.
'For instance, continuous improvement methods (through process innovation)
are commonly considered integral to TQM. However, at least one of the
studies finds that a majority of TQM practitioners are not using these
methods, and that firms using them achieve better results than firms which
do not.'
The report says that none of the studies 'provides any substantial evidence
that TQM is having a negative impact on company performance.' The major
concern for companies is whether it will have a neutral or positive effect
on the business.
That said, the methodologies employed in studying the subject are still
fairly limited: most research only collects management impressions.
'The few that focus on lower-level employee perceptions do not always agree
with the others. Moreover, response rates tend to be low and there is little
in the way of independent measurement of TQM practices.' The debate is not
yet over.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Business Travel: European airlines spar over prices - Travel
Update
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European airlines have launched a series of Christmas promotional discount
fares which they describe as a 'skirmish' rather than an all-out fares war,
writes Michael Skapinker.
The promotions are designed to fill seats when European traffic is at a
traditional post-Christmas lull between January and March.
Lufthansa was the first to start the Christmas discounts with a reduced
fares package for parties of two to four people for travel within Europe.
Under the scheme, the first passenger pays the full fare, the second gets a
50 per cent discount, and the third and fourth get discounts of 25 per cent
each. They must spend a Saturday night at their destination.
British Airways has responded with fare cuts for flights from Frankfurt to
London. Air France has a similar package as Lufthansa for its flights out of
Germany, while SAS and KLM are also offering lower fares.
British airlines, airports and travel agents are still seething over the
announcement of a new departure tax in last week's Budget.
Air passengers flying to another UK or European Union destination will have
to pay Pounds 5. Those flying elsewhere will pay Pounds 10. Transfer and
transit passengers will be exempt, as will children under two, and those
making return journeys within the UK.
The tax comes into effect in October next year. The government says the
measure merely brings the UK into line with other countries which charge air
passengers to leave their territory.
This appears to be the case, according to information gathered by Thomas
Cook, the travel agents chain. The US charges passengers departing on
international flights Dollars 18 (Pounds 12). Japan charges Y2,000 (Pounds
12.40), Germany DM6 (Pounds 2.30), France FFr15 (Pounds 1.70) and Belgium
BFr330 (Pounds 6.10).
British Airways flights to Delhi transfer from Gatwick to Heathrow from
today. They will operate alongside the airline's established services to
Bombay and Madras from Terminal 4. An extra flight to Delhi is also being
added, making six a week.
Italy and France will study building a 290km high-speed rail link between
Lyons and Turin via a tunnel through the Alps. The scheme is expected to
take at least 10 years to complete. The link would halve the journey time to
1 1/2 hours.
Germany and France are among the leading bidders for a Dollars 10bn project
to build China's first high-speed rail link from Beijing to Shanghai,
according to official newspapers in the Chinese capital.
The 1,300km line is intended to ease congestion.
Sabena, the Belgian airline, plans to operate a joint flight with Delta Air
Lines between Brussels and New York. Under the plan Delta would book seats
on Sabena's daily flight from January 16.
Philip Morris, the US cigarette manufacturer, is funding smoking rooms at
airports in an attempt to counteract the growth in non-smoking policies.
Hartsfield Airport, Atlanta, has banned smoking in all areas. Philip Morris
is spending Dollars 250,000 to help build 10 smoking rooms.
KLM, the Dutch airline, is cutting fares to 27 European destinations by
between Fl 84 (Pounds 29.20) and Fl 838 per return ticket between December
27 and March 27.
British nationals planning to travel to Libya should consider whether their
visits are necessary. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions against
Libya in April 1992, including a ban on flights to and from Libya. These
sanctions remain in force and were supplemented by further sanctions,
including a freeze on Libyan assets and a ban on exports of oil-related
equipment, last Wednesday. All British nationals should register with the
British Interests Section, Italian Embassy, Tripoli. Tel:  Tripoli 31191.

FT  06 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller: More first world than wild west -
Philip Gawith guides the first-time visitor around Johannesburg now
sanctions have been lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg has acquired an unhappy reputation as one of the most violent
cities in the world. Certainly, in some of the neighbouring townships, the
cost of human life sometimes appears alarmingly cheap, but the business
visitor should start out in a more positive frame of mind.
Now that sanctions against South Africa have been lifted, there will be an
increasing number of foreign business travellers arriving in the commercial
capital for the first time. If you are paying your first visit, you are
likely to have several concerns: how safe will you be? Where should you
stay? And what can you do in your free time?
In terms of safety, staying and working in downtown Johannesburg is not
markedly different from visiting other large cities. There are muggings.
Cars are sometimes hijacked. But Johannesburg is not the Wild West outpost
it is often portrayed as.
The normal rules of prudence should ensure the safety of any visitor: take
care about being alone at night, do not wear ostentatious jewellery, and
avoid visiting remote areas.
Nevertheless the city centre's poor image has taken its toll. The Carlton is
the only five-star hotel left in the centre, compared with four a few years
ago.
Most businessmen prefer to stay slightly north of Johannesburg in Sandton,
at the Sandton Sun and Towers, or at the Rosebank hotel, in the city's leafy
northern suburbs. New hotel developments in the northern suburbs are
expected, with Hyatt, the US hotels group, likely to run a hotel there.
If you are visiting government departments in Pretoria, which is 45 minutes'
drive from Johannesburg, or an institution such as the Development Bank at
Midrand, midway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, it makes sense to be in
Sandton. It is also a good place to stay if you are visiting some of the
many companies - particularly consumer groups, advertising agencies and
small financial institutions - that have moved into Sandton and the suburbs
from the city centre.
Be warned, though, you will pay for the privilege - Sandton hotel rates are
now considerably higher than those in the city centre.
For visits to many other institutions, however, the Carlton is more
convenient. The mining houses, financial community and stock exchange are
all still in the city centre. For those concerned about their security, the
hotel offers a minder free of charge, who will accompany guests walking
around town.
For those who choose to defy convention and opt for the city centre, there
are two advantages.
First, most of the city's limited cultural activities are located there. The
Market Theatre complex, in particular, is home to some of the most
interesting theatre and music, especially jazz.
Second, the city centre is predominantly black. Staying there reminds you -
by no means in a threatening way - of what continent you have come to do
business in. The mostly white northern suburbs can easily foster the
illusion that you are in San Francisco or Sydney.
ETIQUETTE
South African business culture is very Anglo Saxon in orientation, but
visitors from continental Europe tend to liken it more to the US than the
UK.
There are no quirky business conventions, but visitors are sometimes struck
by the formality of some of the mining houses and banks. Meetings and
lunches are normally jackets-on affairs, and even fellow directors often
refer to the chairman by his title or surname.
Consumer companies are more relaxed and are also more likely to invite their
visitors for a game of golf. The business community is fairly cordial to
visitors: the chances are that you will be invited out in the evening rather
than left to languish in your hotel.
LEISURE
Johannesburg is not much of a tourist destination - there are very few 'must
see' landmarks. More of these can be found in Pretoria, which boasts the
Union Buildings - the seat of government - and the Voortrekker monument.
Johannesburg does, however, have several well-equipped cinema complexes
screening the latest worldwide releases.
For those who have a spare weekend, South Africa's main tourist destinations
are Cape Town and the Western Cape, the Eastern Transvaal - focus of most
wildlife safaris - and the Drakensberg mountains.
Cape Town is a two-hour flight from Johannesburg. A flight to Skukuza or
Nelspruit in the Eastern Transvaal takes about an hour. The best known
luxury safari lodges - Londolozi, Sabi Sabi and Mala Mala - are five to six
hours' drive from Johannesburg. The main resorts in the Drakensberg are four
to five hours' drive.
The Sun City resort is about 1 1/2 hours' drive away. It has two good golf
courses. And the new Palace Hotel at the Lost City is a splendid, if
slightly over-the-top, luxury offering.

Top hotels pick up guests from the airport if arrangements are made
beforehand. Otherwise, a taxi to the city centre or Sandton will cost about
R85 (Pounds 17).
Public transport in the city is poor. Visitors need to hire a car, use taxis
or employ a chauffeur to get to appointments.
Johannesburg has a first-world infrastructure. New visitors are often
surprised at the quality of the roads and the telephone system. Staying in
touch with the office back home is not a problem.
The climate is excellent, but it is not always as clement as foreigners
expect. A typical summer can be quite wet, with frequent afternoon
thunderstorms and occasional wet spells. Also, although summer days tend to
be warm (25-32 degrees Celsius), there can be quite a chill in the evenings.
The winters can be cold, but are usually sunny and dry.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Tecs set for bigger industrial policy role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 82 training and enterprise councils in England and Wales are likely to
become the leading institutions in regional industrial policy after approval
for Kent Tec to take over the economic development activities of Kent County
Council.
The primary jobs of Tecs is to run the two main government training schemes
 -Youth Training and Employment Training for adults - but many of the
business executives on Tec boards are more interested in the mission to
raise the overall quality of business in their areas.
According to Mr Peter Ashby, a leading Tec consultant, the Kent takeover is
likely to promote a wave of similar moves, although in some areas Tecs might
merge with chambers of commerce.
The chairman of Kent Tec is Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel
and a businessman with close links to government. He was recently made head
of the Treasury's private finance working group, set up to promote
private-sector investment in infrastructure projects.
The Kent merger is consequently almost certain to have official endorsement.
That means the government is taking the more permissive stance on
institutional links that Tec leaders have urged.
The Kent merger is also significant because it comes three weeks after the
government announced the establishment of Integrated Regional Offices,
bringing together at regional level such government departments as trade and
industry, transport, environment and employment.
IROs are responsible for urban regeneration budgets, and Tec-local authority
mergers will be in a strong position to bid for large parts of them. The
establishment of IROs is also a response to the Tec complaint that
government speaks in too many conflicting voices, especially at regional
level.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Sharper focus on careers advice in schools urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lack of focus on careers education in the UK leaves many young British
people worse off than their continental counterparts for making a successful
transition to the world of work, a report published today says.
The report, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,
compares school vocational guidance in the UK, Germany, Switzerland and the
Netherlands.
Careers guidance on the Continent tends to starts earlier, is taught by
careers specialists in separate lessons devoted to the topic and is geared
to providing young people with detailed information on careers and ensuring
that courses taken at school are relevant. In Britain careers advice is not
part of the national curriculum and teachers are frequently untrained in
careers guidance.
The report comes when big changes are being made to the delivery of careers'
advice to young people. The government has taken it out of local authority
control and is seeking tenders from new providers, which may include local
authorities. The need for good quality advice has never been greater because
of the development of training credits, with young people able to seek out
prospective employers with whom they invest their credits in return for
training.
The report's recommendations include an earlier start to work experience,
the reinstatement of classes in vocational guidance, greater targeting of
relevant information through a detailed syllabus, more emphasis on
vocational guidance in teacher training and the greater involvement of
parents.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Discord on London orchestra cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philharmonia has been chosen by Lord Justice Hoffmann to be the super
orchestra of London.
But his decision, given to the Arts Council music panel on Friday, has yet
to be made public and it seems unlikely the Hoffmann report will be accepted
without modification.
The council asked Lord Justice Hoffmann, a music lover, to conduct an
inquiry into three subsidised orchestras: the London Philharmonic, the Royal
Philharmonic and the Philharmonia, two of which would lose their subsidy.
The London Symphony Orchestra, resident at the Barbican, was excused the
competition.
There have been attempts for more than 20 years to reduce the number of
London-based orchestras receiving Arts Council subsidy, with the aim of
saving money and creating a world-class orchestra able to compete with the
best in Vienna and Berlin.
The contest raised a storm of controversy, not least because the odds seemed
stacked in favour of the LPO. It has just entered its second season of a
five-year residency as the orchestra of the South Bank Centre, with an
increased annual subsidy of Pounds 1.3m to allow for extra rehearsal time.
Lord Justice Hoffmann heard all three orchestras play and considered their
written proposals. His choice of the Philharmonia creates problems for the
South Bank and the Arts Council. Its music panel will have to decide whether
it agrees with the choice. Even if it does the full Arts Council, meeting
next week, can overturn the decision.
The LPO's position at the South Bank, with a series of concerts planned
years ahead, becomes impossible without a grant. If its concerts were
cancelled it might have a legal case against the Arts Council, which funds
the South Bank.
The RPO, which receives only Pounds 400,000 a year in subsidy, or 7 per cent
of its income, did not expect to be chosen but might now look more
favourably on an Arts Council proposal to make it the orchestra serving the
east of England.
The future of the Philharmonia, which receives Pounds 700,000 in annual
grant, seems secure. But it seems unlikely that the Arts Council will be
able to withdraw subsidy to the LPO suddenly from next April, just two years
after approving it.
The LPO has hit a bad patch, with a management shake-up in the summer and
continuing controversy over its principal conductor, Frans Welser-Most.
A compromise might be worked out. The problem is that the Arts Council had
its government grant for 1994-95 cut by 1.7 per cent in the Budget last
week. It does not have enough money to both increase support for the
Philharmonia and keep the other two orchestras afloat. It might defer a
decision until after its examination of the regional orchestras next year
with the BBC.

FT  06 DEC 93 / BBC and Tussauds hold theme park talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is looking at the possibility of building a multi-million-pound
theme park or exhibition centre in Britain which would feature some of its
best-known programmes.
The project is being examined with Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tussauds Group, which runs Alton Towers,
Chessington World of Adventures, Madame Tussaud's and the London
Planetarium.
Ms Juliete Simpkins of Tussauds Group said yesterday: 'I can confirm that we
are involved in a study with the BBC on building a theme park. But
discussions are at a very early stage. It would be a multi-million-pound
venture.'
Ideas being discussed for a park could cover theme restaurants, special
effects and replica sets of the BBC's successful shows.
These could include Dr Who, with an exhibition of fights between Cybermen
and Daleks, and East Enders, with a reproduction of Albert Square and the
Queen Vic public house.
The BBC said: 'We are talking to the Pearson group. But everything is at a
tentative stage. I cannot confirm what the park would cost.'

FT  06 DEC 93 / MPs call for new child support rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The all-party Commons social security committee will today propose sweeping
changes to the running of the controversial Child Support Agency.
But the committee's report falls well short of recommending its abolition,
accepting instead the principle behind the agency - that fathers should
recognise responsibility for their children from a previous marriage.
This conclusion has infuriated Mr Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour MP for Islington
North, who has submitted a dissenting note calling for the agency's
replacement with a system of maintenance payments upheld by court orders.
The report on the operation of the Child Support Act makes four main
proposals:
Fathers who face big rises in maintenance bills from the agency should be
given more time to pay so they can adjust their own budgets.
The committee favours allowing payments to be phased in over as long as two
years, depending on the circumstances of the case. Some men are being
presented with bills as much as 200 per cent higher than those fixed under
court orders, prompting many complaints that second families are being made
to suffer.
Divorced fathers who have to pay maintenance to their first family should be
left with more money for their second family.
The report suggests that the father's protected income support - income
support plus Pounds 8 - should be increased to a minimum of income support
plus Pounds 20 and a maximum of income support plus Pounds 40.
The agency should target fathers who are dodging payments altogether,
instead of those who are already paying.
The agency recently admitted that it was mainly targeting fathers who were
already paying some maintenance. The agency is also criticised for being too
slow in assessing what fathers should pay. The agency should look again at
how it calculates a father's assessable income, particularly in the case of
fathers who have handed over matrimonial property in return for reduced
payments.
The MPs are concerned that the agency's rigid formula, that richer fathers
should on average pay 25 per cent of assessable income, is not always fair.
The report's conclusions follow the announcement of a review of the agency.
While Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is likely to be pleased
with the MPs' backing for the principle of the agency, he is expected to
resist some of their recommendations.
It is understood that Mr Corbyn's decision to dissent came after the
committee took only oral evidence from Mr Alistair Burt, the minister
responsible for the agency, and Ms Ros Hepplewhite, its chief executive,
though it took written evidence from other sources.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Illumination from the past: Midland's chief executive, who
will retire in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent cinema advertisement for a high street bank showed a Liverpudlian
teenager enthusing about his job. About 43 years after Mr Brian Pearse
joined Martins Bank in Liverpool as a 17-year-old he retains a similar
enthusiasm for a calling that some people regard as in decline.
Mr Pearse last week announced that he will retire as chief executive of
Midland Bank in March. Since being brought in by the Bank of England to
restore Midland's battered fortunes in March 1991 he has sometimes appeared
the last advocate of an older, endangered style of high street banking.
'I would be very happy now to be appointed area manager of Kendal (in
Cumbria) and be told that I had to stay there for the next 20 years. It is
not because I want to be idle. It is a tremendous business with lots going
on,' says the man who some expected to become Midland's chairman.
It is not to be. HSBC Holdings - the company formed by Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank after its takeover of Midland last year - has instead appointed Sir
William Purves, its own chairman, to the post when Sir Peter Walters, the
present incumbent, moves on with Mr Pearse next year.
Some analysts question whether Mr Pearse's legacy is wholly safe in HSBC's
hands. HSBC is known for its rigorous control of costs and use of
technology. Of all Midland's assets, the Firstdirect telephone banking arm
is the one that excited HSBC executives most on their first tour.
Mr Pearse says telephone banking has proved far more attractive than Midland
thought when in 1988 it put the whole UK market at 300,000 customers.
Firstdirect alone had 400,000 customers by the middle of this year.
But he remains cautious. 'It is a less personal approach than you get at a
branch. You never speak to the same person twice,' he says.
Such praise for branches is unfashionable as banks try to reduce the costs
of their networks. But it is typical of Mr Pearse. Since his arrival from
his previous post as finance director of Barclays - the bank which took over
Martins - Midland has often marched in a contrary direction.
This has emerged in two ways. Midland has been sceptical about using
technology to replace human judgment. It has also re-established its
branches as the point of contact for personal and corporate customers, while
other banks have started dealing with businesses from area offices.
Mr Pearse's background plays a strong part in the former. 'None of us got
where we are today by just following the directions that are given to us. If
you are a slavish devotee to the rules you never get anywhere. I have been
trying to give people the confidence to spread their wings,' he says.
In particular, Mr Pearse says that staff have to be allowed to override the
impersonal scoring of credit to personal customers by computer.
'We had got to the point where someone was not allowed to turn a customer
down whom the computer accepted. I mean, how daft can you get?'
He reversed an earlier strategy of dividing customers between managers after
an early branch visit.
'One man looked after retail, on the first floor was another who looked
after small businesses, then there was another looking after large firms.
They never talked to each other,' he says.
This faith in rounded human judgment is not only unfashionable, it can be
costly. Midland has a relatively high ratio of costs to income compared with
other HSBC businesses. Mr Pearse says the way to solve this is to push more
business through the network of branches and well-trained staff.
He believes that this is the way to restore public faith and to woo
customers.
He is unhappy at the idea that service standards should be increasingly
regulated under the banks' voluntary code of banking practice.
'The code is trying to define every single standard, and I think that is
unfortunate. I wish we did not have one at all,' he says. 'We have got to
the stage where people are saying that standards have dropped and customers
should be protected, and as a banker I find that very sad.'
The question for Midland is whether HSBC will maintain Mr Pearse's faith in
branch banking traditions and human judgment. It could be tempted to
experiment with technology in areas such as lending to small businesses,
which is already centralised in its US retail banking subsidiary.
Mr Pearse will have other things on his mind by then. He has earmarked youth
unemployment as a project for his retirement. He says, 'I just want to stand
back and see if there is any way in which I can help, because I am deeply
disturbed by it.'

FT  06 DEC 93 / Lilley in retreat over targeting of benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, yesterday retreated from
earlier hints that middle-class entitlement to universal child benefit and
the basic state pension could be withdrawn.
He said his opposition to opting out of the basic pension was 'a pledge for
me forever'.
His comments followed a warning to rightwing ministers from Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, that speculation about benefit entitlements could
undermine public acceptance of his tough Budget.
Labour moved quickly to exploit the divisions in the government. Mr Donald
Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said: 'This is a major reverse by
Mr Lilley, and it suggests that his wings have been well and truly clipped.'
Mr Lilley said on ITV's Walden programme that both universal child benefit
and the universal basic pension would remain unchanged during the present
parliament.
His assurances contrasted sharply with earlier suggestions that universal
child benefit should be replaced by a targeted benefit, and that opting out
of the basic pension should be encouraged.
They coincided with suggestions that Labour's Social Justice Commission
might be preparing to recommend much greater targeting of benefits when it
reports next year to Mr John Smith, the party leader.
But officials said reports that the commission had decided to call for the
abolition of universal child benefit were 'premature speculation'.
The commission reported yesterday in one of a series of preliminary papers
that Britain is increasingly divided between 'work-rich' and 'work-poor'
families.
The paper, Work and Welfare, says there are more dual-earner couples
alongside more no-earner couples, and the inflexible benefit system is
partly to blame. The authors, Mr Paul Gregg, of the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research and Edward Balls, of the Financial Times, say
dependence on benefits among people of working age has grown from less than
3m in 1977 to 5.5m by 1991.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Travel agents 'under threat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A draft European Union directive to regulate distance selling could put 20
per cent of travel companies out of business within six months, the
Association of British Travel Agents says.
The directive is designed to regulate the purchase of goods and service by
mail order, telephone, electronic mail, television and other technologies.
Abta said that changes to an earlier draft of the directive meant that
travel agents would no longer be regarded as direct suppliers of holidays.
Customers who used a travel agent to arrange holidays with tour operators
would be deemed to have concluded a distance selling contract with the
operator. Abta said 90 per cent of holidays sold in the UK would be affected
by the directive.
The directive also says that providers of goods and services through
distance selling cannot demand payment until after delivery of the product
or performance of the service.
Abta said: 'The travel industry relies for its very existence on planning
ahead and taking pre-payments from the consumer. Suppliers require
pre-payment from travel companies and the restriction on a company's
cashflow caused by an inability to require payment from a consumer would put
a vast number of companies out of business.
'The result may be that only a few large companies would survive. The
association estimates that this requirement may put of of business as much
as 20 per cent of its membership within six months and would anticipate that
similar effects will be felt within the rest of the European Community.'

FT  06 DEC 93 / Project to support sales to Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Chambers of Commerce in Continental Europe has launched a
support service to help small and medium-sized UK companies win business on
the Continent.
The organisation, which operates in 11 European countries and has more than
6,000 members, has agreed to provide information and assistance to companies
which want to start selling in Continental markets.
Companies will be able to enlist the help of staff nominated in each local
chamber to analyse local market opportunities and to identify potential
customers. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has endorsed the move, which
will be supported by several government departments.
Mr Michael Ingham, president of the council of the British chambers, said:
'It is of the utmost importance, especially to small and medium-sized
companies, that there is a group of people throughout Europe ready to assist
them penetrate those markets.'
He said the level of support for British exporters in Europe had generally
compared unfavourably with that provided to their European competitors.

FT  06 DEC 93 / BBC and Tussauds in theme park talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is looking at the possibility of building a multi-million pound
theme park or exhibition centre in Britain which would feature some its
best-known programmes.
The project is being examined in conjunction with Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tussauds Group, which
runs Alton Towers, Chessington World of Adventures, Madame Tussaud's and the
London Planetarium.
Ms Juliete Simpkins of Tussauds Group said yesterday: 'I can confirm that we
are involved in a study with the BBC on building a theme park. But
discussions are at a very early stage. It would be a multi-million pound
venture. The feasibility study is meant to find out what a theme park would
cost.
Ideas being discussed for a park could cover theme restaurants, special
effects, and replica sets of the BBC's successful shows.
These could include Dr Who with an exhibition of fights between Cybermen and
Daleks, East Enders, with a reproduction of Albert Square and the Queen Vic
public house. Other sets suggested are Birds of a Feather, Casualty and
Noel's House Party.
The BBC said: 'We are interested in building a theme park. We are talking to
the Pearson group. But everything is at a tentative stage. I cannot confirm
what the park would cost or that Pearson would pay for it.'
Ms Simpkins said: 'The BBC theme park is one of a number of projects we are
looking at. Another possible scheme is in New York, where we are thinking
about a permanent show.'
The Tussauds Group runs the largest number of paid-for attractions in
Britain. These include Alton Towers in Staffordshire which last year
attracted 2.5m visitors and Madame Tussauds with 3.2m.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Whitehall officials forecast up to 6,000 job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 1,000 civil service jobs will go within a few months of
implementing the Budget plan to merge unemployment benefit and income
support into the jobseekers' allowance in 1996, say Whitehall officials.
They also say that up to 6,000 jobs will be lost over the following few
years.
It has long been accepted in Whitehall that the unemployed should be served
by one department rather than two as at present - the Department of
Employment for job-finding and the payment of unemployment benefit, and the
Department of Social Security for the payment of income support, which is
received by 70 per cent of the unemployed.
Officials say it is probable that the payment of the jobseekers' allowance
will be centralised in the Employment Service, a semi-autonomous agency in
the Department of Employment. The department's residual functions are likely
to be shared between the trade and industry and education departments.
One insider said: 'If the Conservatives win the next election (the
Department of) Employment is not likely to survive, but they will only be
able to close it if unemployment is falling,'
Currently about 32,000 people in the Employment Service and 12,000 in the
DSS are involved in the payment of unemployment-related benefits. If the
payment of JSA was to be concentrated on the DSS the benefit would lose its
labour-market focus. This has just been reinforced by the government's
insistence that JSA recipients must sign a jobseeker's agreement.
Claimants already agree a 'back to work plan' with an official at their
local Job Centre. But in the new agreement people will have to sign a
document and the onus will shift to claimants to prove that they are
actively seeking a job.
As well as reducing the duration of non-means-tested unemployment benefit
from 12 months to six months, under the JSA there will be no no higher rate
for people who are married or have dependants.
But in the harmonisation of the rules between the JSA and unemployment
benefit the partners of the unemployed will benefit, being allowed to work
24 hours a week rather than the previous 16 hours.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Move to reassure Ulster unionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday offered reassurances to the
Northern Ireland unionists in an attempt to keep peace negotiations on
course.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said on Irish radio that
reports of British concessions on the constitutional issue were
'ill-informed nonsense'.
He confirmed that the Irish government was willing to offer a written pledge
to hold a referendum - but only as part of an overall settlement. The talks
were still 'firmly on course' in spite of serious disagreements exposed on
Friday. He added, however, that time might be running out for a deal.
Mr Reynolds said later in a television interview that Ireland was halfway to
peace.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, bluntly rejected suggestions that
Britain agreed to compromise on the Irish claim to Ulster during talks in
Dublin on Friday. He said there had been 'no softening on any point of
principle. The principle here - and this is the key to the whole thing - is
consent.'
Mr Hurd said the talks between Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
and Mr Reynolds had gone through some 'rough passages'. But there was
agreement on both sides that the future of Northern Ireland would remain
firmly in the hands of the people of the province.
His remarks were intended to reassure unionists that the government would
not accept any deal which failed to include an Irish referendum on articles
2 and 3 of the republic's constitution, which lay claim to Northern Ireland.
Officials said the government's position might have been misinterpreted
because of confusion about the form a peace agreement might take.
One suggestion is that the first paper produced by the talks would be
restricted to a general statement of principles, intended to sustain the
momentum of the process.
It would be followed by a more detailed paper in which the republic would be
expected to offer guarantees that a referendum on the disputed articles
would form part of an overall peace agreement.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Thatcher prepares for grilling on exports to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the government's handling of
military-related exports to Iraq reaches a crucial stage this week when it
takes evidence from Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister.
The inquiry has promised to investigate a range of areas where Lady Thatcher
may have exercised ultimate responsibility over Britain's approach to arming
Saddam Hussein's regime before the Gulf War.
For the first time the inquiry will have the chance to discover the
philosophy behind the government's stance on Iraq from the highest level. It
will also assess the extent of Lady Thatcher's personal knowledge of
decisions which allowed machine-tool exports and the sale to Iraq of other
military hardware.
The questioning of Lady Thatcher by an inquiry into her government's
policies is not unprecedented. She gave evidence to Lord Franks' inquiry
into the Falklands conflict in 1982. But on this occasion she will be
subject to questioning in public.
Lady Thatcher is expected to appear at the inquiry on Wednesday, unless the
date is hurriedly rearranged. The confined and relaxed atmosphere of the
inquiry room at Buckingham Gate has heightened security fears surrounding
her appearance.
Lord Justice Scott is anxious, however, that the inquiry should follow the
course that has been established in the previous eight months of hearings,
where questioning is led by his counsel, Ms Presiley Baxendale QC.
Ms Baxendale's adversarial capabilities are likely to be tested to the full
in a day-long session of questioning.
Lady Thatcher can be expected to use this return to the political spotlight
to mount a vigorous defence of her policies.
The extent to which Ms Baxendale will be able to employ an approach that has
occasionally bordered on the inquisitorial will be watched keenly by former
political adversaries and colleagues who attempted to challenge Lady
Thatcher during her premiership.
Expectations of a rare display of drama have been raised by the pitting of
legal exactitude against political acumen in the semi-formal atmosphere of
the Scott hearings.
While Lady Thatcher's formidable style of delivery is well-known, she will
be encountering a disarmingly friendly approach from her questioner which
has previously masked an ability by Ms Baxendale to deliver pointed remarks,
usually accompanied with a broad smile.
The questioning will centre on events towards the end of Mrs Thatcher's
tenure as prime minister in November 1990, nearly four months after the
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
One focus will be the extent of her knowledge of the way that Foreign Office
guidelines on exports to Iraq were changed after 1984.
She will be asked specifically whether she knowingly misled parliament in
dealing with questions on the Iraqi policy.
The hearing has already been told that ministers misled MPs in a string of
parliamentary answers, drafted by Department of Trade and Industry
officials, which denied that the government had changed its policy towards
Iraq after the 1988 ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war.
The inquiry has documents to show that in 1988 ministers changed the policy
towards Iraq, allowing the export of equipment to Iraqi arms factories. In
April 1989 Lady Thatcher explicitly denied the policy change in an answer to
Labour MP Mr Harry Cohen. The inquiry will want to know whether she was
aware of the change at the time.
Lady Thatcher will also be asked to shed light on an assertion made at an
earlier hearing by Mr Alan Barrett, a Ministry of Defence official
responsible for vetting militarily useful exports to Iraq, that she had
authorised exports that could be used for making shells and missiles.

FT  06 DEC 93 / BR acts to allay fears over its Eurostar trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail moved swiftly yesterday to counter fears of further delays to
its high-profile Eurostar services through the Channel tunnel after
disclosing an embarrassing technical problem on the British end of the
route.
The Eurostar prototype, which is being tested on the 70-mile stretch between
London and Folkestone, has been unable to cope with occasional gaps in the
third rail, from which trains on Network SouthEast pick up their power.
The onboard computer switches off the engine and turns signals to red when
it passes over gaps in the third rail at level crossings or points.
In a short statement yesterday European Passenger Services, the BR
subsidiary that will run services through the tunnel, said: 'The test
programme of the Eurostar prototype has revealed an interference phenomenon
involving track circuits on parts of the route to the Channel tunnel.
'A programme of modification to the affected track circuit equipment has
been developed and the implementation timetable allows completion of the
work in time for Eurostar services to start next summer.'
Freight services through the Channel tunnel start in March, with 'Le
Shuttle' tourist services expected to start two months later, about the time
of the official inauguration on May 6.
Eurostar services from London to Paris and Brussels had already been delayed
to late summer because of delivery delays and previous technical problems
with the trains' onboard computer.
No date has yet been fixed for services to start, and introduction of
Eurostar trains will depend on the results of further testing.
Although the latest problem is not expected to cause more delays, it is
bound to prompt further criticism of the government for blocking
construction of a dedicated high-speed link for Channel tunnel trains in
time for the tunnel opening. The controversial link through Kent and east
London is due to open in 2001.
A consortium led by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, is
building 38 Eurostar trains costing Pounds 24m each - 31 for the routes from
London and seven for services from Manchester and Edinburgh.

FT  06 DEC 93 / US-style public funding proposed for CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Corporation of London is to send a team to the US to study public-sector
financing schemes which could be used as a model for building the
long-delayed Pounds 2bn CrossRail link in London.
In the past two weeks the corporation, the local authority for the City, has
presented the Department of the Environment with a complex proposal for a
levy on its business rates to raise about Pounds 50m a year.
The money would be used to secure borrowings that would contribute to the
cost of CrossRail, which would link British Rail lines in the east and west
of London via a tunnel between Liverpool Street and Paddington stations.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources
committee, said yesterday that the idea could 'bridge the gap' - of as much
as Pounds 500m - between public funding for CrossRail and the amount which
the private sector is prepared to invest as risk capital.
The corporation believes CrossRail could be vital to London's
infrastructural needs by easing the pressure on the Central Line, and has
previously warned that the project could collapse if the government waits
for conventional private-sector finance. Consequently, it is looking at
adapting US schemes in which local authorities raise money from a bond issue
which is backed by the regular revenue stream from business rates and local
taxes.
The corporation only spends Pounds 70m of the Pounds 700m it raises in
taxation, but a review is likely to cut revenue by as much as half from
1995.
Mr Cassidy believes business ratepayers will accept a slightly smaller
reduction if they know that the levy is being used for infrastructural
improvements from which they will benefit.
The corporation is discussing the scheme with officials at the environment
department, which would have to approve it.
Approval would also be needed from the Treasury, which has previously been
unwilling to allow business rates to be earmarked for transport.
The corporation team will visit the US before Christmas.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Traffic law may be used to keep City cordon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City of London police may use traffic management powers to retain the
controversial security cordon around the Square Mile if objectors seek its
withdrawal next year.
The cordon, which restricts and monitors traffic movements in the central
area of the City, was set up in July after April's Bishopsgate bombing which
killed one person and injured more than 40.
It was introduced for a six-month experimental period under traffic powers,
and the City Corporation is likely to extend the experi-ment for a further
six months.
Retention for longer than that would require government approval. Objectors
 -possibly including surrounding boroughs - could force a public inquiry.
Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner of the City of London police, said one option,
rather than removing the controls pending an inquiry, would be to redesign
the cordon as a new traffic management experiment.
'It would be foolhardy to remove the cordon while the terrorist threat
remains,' he said. 'I would sooner answer to a charge that I had abused my
power than that I had done nothing.'
Mr Kelly, who retires as commissioner this week, regards his introduction of
the cordon as probably the most controversial decision any chief constable
has had to take in recent years.
He said: 'Some people complained that it would make the City of London like
Belfast, but it has not done so. The checks are not overpowering and
obtrusive. Many people tell us they now feel more secure.'
City of London police stepped up street patrols after last year's Baltic
Exchange bombing, and a year ago last week introduced random vehicle
checkpoints using armed officers.
Mr Kelly said: 'The subsequent Bishopsgate bombing proved that these
measures were insufficient. We had to do more. Of course terrorists can
penetrate a security cordon. To make any area risk-free would involve levels
of security that people would find unacceptable. But I had a duty to do all
I reasonably could.'
He has faced three main criticisms of the security ring - that it was a
propaganda coup for the IRA, would at best divert terrorists elsewhere, and
might act as a challenge to bombers to penetrate the cordon.
'I reject all three. There is no propaganda coup to equal a bomb explosion.
Terrorists have to put massive planning and effort into staging a big
operation and, if they want to attack the heart of the financial community,
will not necessarily put the same effort into a substitute target.
'As to the argument that we are challenging them to strike again - they have
proved with their attacks on the City that they do not need us to challenge
them. Doing nothing was not an option.'
One consequence of the security measures has been a reduction in crime in
the City by 10 per cent last year, and a further 18 per cent so far this
year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a quarter of homes bought between 1988 and 1991 are worth less
than the mortgages that were used to buy them, says a study published today
by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
The survey found that the proportion of owners with negative equity from
those years had risen during the past 12 months from 21 per cent to 26 per
cent.
The Bank of England estimated the number of households with negative equity
rose to 1.8m in the first quarter of the year. In October Woolwich Building
Society said that figure had fallen to 1.36m.

Consumer credit in the three months to the end of October was 26 per cent
higher than in the same period last year, the Finance and Leasing
Association says. While the figure for October at Pounds 1.084bn was 12 per
cent down on September it was 21 per cent higher than in October 1992.
The association's figures show that personal loans in October were 32 per
cent higher than a year earlier.
Infolink, the independent credit information organisation, says it found a
12.6 per cent year-on-year increase in loans for new cars in October.

FT  06 DEC 93 / GCHQ staff plan overtime protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 50 staff at GCHQ, the government intelligence centre, are protesting
against new overtime rosters, Richard Donkin writes.
The unco-ordinated action is low key because of the ban on union membership
and industrial action at the Cheltenham eavesdropping centre. The
disaffected staff are more than half the personnel who have had new overtime
rosters imposed on them. Some have made approaches to the GCHQ unions' group
set up by those sacked when they refused to give up their union membership
after the government introduced the ban in 1984.
GCHQ said: 'We have heard that some individuals have banded together to see
if there are ways to register dissatisfaction.'

FT  06 DEC 93 / Export aid for companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Council of British Chambers of Commerce in Continental Europe has
launched a support service to help small and medium-sized UK companies win
business on the Continent.
The organisation, which operates in 11 European countries and has more than
6,000 members, has agreed to provide information and assistance to companies
which want to start selling in Continental markets. Companies will be able
to enlist the help of staff nominated in each chamber to analyse local
market opportunities and to identify potential customers.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has endorsed the move, which will be
supported by several government departments.
Mr Michael Ingham, president of the council, said that the chambers had
represented an untapped resource for British exporters but they had now been
able to agree a joint plan of action to be adopted across Europe.
He said: 'It is of the utmost importance, especially to small and
medium-sized companies, that there is a group of people throughout Europe
ready to assist them.'
He said the level of support for British exporters in Europe had generally
compared unfavourably with that provided to their European competitors. The
British chambers had the right mix of business expertise and local market
knowledge to help redress the imbalance.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Logica leads battle project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium of 17 European companies led by Logica, the British computing
services group, is developing a battlefield control system which could give
the UK and Europe a technological edge over the US in electronic warfare. It
may also have applications in civil systems, including the emergency
services and air traffic control.
The Grace consortium includes Matra Cap of France, Datamat of Italy, Indra
Sistemas of Spain and the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory.
The contract, worth about Pounds 17m, is being funded under the European
Collaboration for the Long term in Defence (Euclid) programme. The defence
ministries of the participating seven countries have put up Pounds 2m each
and the companies are investing Pounds 3m.
Dr Derek Barnes of the UK Defence Research Agency, which is chairing the
Grace management group, said the project could provide a boost for European
industry.
The aim is to develop 'intelligent' computer software capable of handling,
processing and displaying large volumes of information of the kind generated
during a land or naval battle.
Dr Barnes said the project would ask fundamental questions, including
whether artificial intelligence was advanced enough to allow machines to
make strategic decisions. He added: 'The project could provide the basis for
a standard command and control workstation for European defence purposes.
The technology would also have applications in air traffic control,
ambulance despatch and oilfield management.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Treasury promotes family values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mandarins at the Treasury have been told to abandon the habits of a lifetime
and go home early rather than risk overworking and disrupting their family
lives.
Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, has told senior officials
that their junior staff should cut down on excess work by reducing their
briefings for ministers and other Whitehall departments. The change is
designed partly to create a more relaxed atmosphere and encourage more women
with family commitments to rise to the top of the department.
Treasury officials spend a lot of time preparing general briefings for
ministers on how to answer tricky questions about economic policy.
In an effort to make the Treasury culture more sympathetic to women, who
comprise 45 per cent of staff but just 7 per cent of the top 140 officials,
Sir Terry is meeting a group of junior women from the department tomorrow to
discuss subjects such as childcare provision and part-time working. This
follows an earlier meeting with senior women officials to discuss such
issues.
The initiatives are designed to counter what an official says is a 'macho'
style at the Treasury of encouraging overwork, which officials now admit is
sometimes counterproductive.
One official said: 'We have a tremendous tendency to write a vast amount of
briefings which are used for purely defensive purposes.'
Another admitted: 'We waste a lot of time producing the same material over
and over again.'
After an internal survey early this year indicated that large numbers of the
Treasury's 1,400 staff often worked 11-hour days, Sir Terry has instructed
top officials to cut down on their habit of working late into the evening.
One official said: 'We are trying to substitute quality for quantity and
persuade people that it is acceptable to go home early.'
Sir Terry's initiative comes as the Treasury is starting a project with 15
leading companies, including BP, British Aerospace, Cable &amp; Wireless, Boots,
Lloyds Bank and the UK subsidiaries of IBM, Nissan, and Merck, to encourage
more of its officials to mix with industrialists to learn about business.
Under the scheme 15 Treasury officials aged between 25 and 35 will shadow
counterparts from business in an attempt to encourage a greater flow of
outside ideas into the Treasury.
These efforts are part of a broad move by Sir Terry to change the management
style of Britain's most important government department, which has been
criticised for being too introverted and over-concerned with limiting public
spending rather than thinking imaginatively about the economy.

FT  06 DEC 93 / IMF near special aid relaunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has almost enough money to relaunch its
special loan fund to help the world's poorest countries restructure their
economies, but the fund is facing an uphill struggle to win the final
commitments it needs.
Donor countries have promised about 80 per cent of the funds the IMF is
seeking for its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, which lends money
at 0.5 per cent interest to low-income developing countries, mostly in
sub-Saharan Africa. But many donor countries have made their pledges
conditional on other rich countries playing their part. Negotiations are now
at a critical stage, if the ESAF is to be relaunched by the end of this year
as originally planned.
The IMF needs 5bn special drawing rights (Pounds 5.35bn) in capital to be
loaned to developing countries over the next three or four years. This money
is deposited by government financial institutions, such as Japan's Eximbank,
and earns interest, and so is less difficult to raise.
But the IMF also needs about SDR1.5bn of contributions to subsidise the ESAF
interest rate at 0.5 per cent.
Although falling world interest rates have reduced the gap between this
subsidised rate and market rates, the IMF still faces great difficulties
obtaining all the money that it needs for this subsidy account.
National aid budgets around the world have come under severe pressure, and
aid agencies in each donor country have been reluctant to hand over more of
their shrinking resources to a multilateral programme such as ESAF, despite
generally positive views of its results.
Japan and France, the two biggest contributors to the first ESAF, were among
the first to commit themselves to the new facility. At the same time, the
IMF has cast its net more widely and has obtained commitments from a number
of countries in Asia, Latin America and the Gulf.
Many of the promises now on the table could be withdrawn, however, if the US
cannot be persuaded to contribute something. Although the ESAF avoids any
strict burden-sharing formula, countries watch each other in order to spot
any government avoiding its responsibilities.
The US, the largest economy in the world, contributed only SDR105m to the
SDR2.5bn subsidy fund for the last ESAF - less than Sweden or Switzerland.
The original ESAF, whose life has been extended to the end of this month,
has made loan commitments totalling SDR3.2bn to 29 countries. Although about
SDR2bn remains unspent, this money could be taken up quickly if agreements
were to be reached, as expected, with Pakistan and possibly India.

<TEXT>
International environmental officials hope to win promises of funds
totalling Dollars 2bn from donor countries to tackle global environmental
problems over the next three years.
Delegates from more than 70 countries will meet at Cartagena in Colombia
this week in an effort to turn the three-year-old Global Environment
Facility into a permanent funding mechanism for the Rio de Janeiro
conventions on global warming and biodiversity last year.
The interim GEF, due to expire in mid-1994, has so far distributed more than
Dollars 730m for projects related to the two conventions and for others
meant to protect international waters and prevent ozone depletion.
Mr Mohamed El-Ashry, chairman of the interim GEF, said significant progress
in narrowing differences of opinion among the member nations had left him
'cautiously optimistic' that agreement would be reached. However, he added,
there are 'significant issues that need to be agreed  - any hardening of one
side or another on any of the issues could block agreement.'
Governance and funding are among the most critical remaining issues, he
said.
In other international funds, such as the World Bank's International
Development Association, the US provides 20.86 per cent of funds.
Analysts speculate the US may provide a similar percentage of the GEF, or
about Dollars 400m. This figure would probably make the US the largest
contributor to the GEF.
The US did not contribute to the Dollars 1.1bn core funds of the pilot
project, but has committed Dollars 150m in parallel financing.
Before committing funds, the US must have the ability to screen
controversial projects, according to a US Treasury official.
The US also wants information about projects to be accessible, with
provisions for the participation of local people and non-governmental
organisations.
An independent evaluation of the interim GEF cited problems similar to the
US concerns as issues to be addressed so as to improve the facility's
environmental and social impact.
'If we do not reach key policy objectives, we will not proceed,' the
Treasury official said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday said it would let foreigners run joint-venture airlines in
1994, as part of a programme to speed the development of aviation, Reuter
reports from Beijing.
Foreigners also would be allowed to invest in China's commercial airports
and run all operations except air traffic control, according to Mr Lin Kun,
a senior foreign trade official. He also said similar investment would be
allowed in other parts of China's transport system and infrastructure.
Mr Lin said economic growth and industrial production had expanded so
briskly that China would be forced to resort more foreign-led 'build,
operate and transfer' projects. Beijing has been insisting on relying on
foreigners only for aircraft.
However, air accidents and outbreaks of chaos at airports have persuaded the
government that rapid import of aircraft without improving ground control,
reservations and passenger management was unsustainable.

FT  06 DEC 93 / World Bank presses Asians to protect environment now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The belief in rapidly growing Asian economies that prosperity must be
assured before environmental issues can be tackled is incorrect, according
to a World Bank report, published today.
The report cites the principal causes of environmental degradation in Asia
as government inaction, population growth, urbanisation and
industrialisation, as well as the mistaken belief that strong economic
growth is necessary to allow environmental protection.
In the report - Toward an environmental strategy for Asia - the authors, Mr
Carter Brandon and Mr Ramesh Ramankutty, argue against such a belief, saying
that sensible environmental policies increase economic efficiency.
'The most financially viable environment-related investments are those that
are good for both economic development and the environment,' the report
says, 'including energy conservation, waste minimisation in industry (as
opposed to end-of-pipe investments), recycling in the urban sector, fuel
efficiency in the transport sector, soil conservation and sustainable
forestry.'
According to the World Bank, developing countries need to spend 2 to 3 per
cent of annual gross domestic product to achieve greater 'sustainability'.
In Asia, this translates into about Dollars 38bn annually by 2000,
two-thirds of it in east Asia.
'It's cheaper to start with clean technology than to clean up afterwards,'
Mr Brandon told a news conference in Bangkok. He cited the example of Japan
in the early 1970s, when a public outcry meant that a quarter of all
industrial investment was directed to pollution control equipment, instead
of the usual 3 to 4 per cent.
Increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent, by the end of the century, in
itself would reduce the level of new capital investment required in Asia by
Dollars 90bn, the report says.
'Not only are these savings very large, they are three times the cost of
installing cleaner technologies on the facilities still to be constructed,'
it says.
One problem in convincing Asian governments of the need for environmental
protection is the lack of data about the true cost of environmental
destruction.
Initial estimates suggest that air and water pollution in Bangkok costs more
than Dollars 2bn a year, and in Jakarta more than Dollars 1bn. 'The
magnitude of the (urban) problem is about 10 per cent of the total GDP of
large Asian cities,' Mr Brandon said, 'while the magnitude of the solution
is only about one or two per cent.'
Some countries, however, are beginning to appreciate the scale of the
problem. Mr Chuan Leekpai, Thailand's prime minister, told a conference on
business and the environment in Bangkok last week that the government would
invest about Dollars 900m in environmental protection during the next five
years.
The World Bank report paints a grim picture of environmental decay in Asia.
With vehicle numbers doubling every seven years, urban air pollution is at
'critical levels', and five of the seven cities in the world with the worst
air pollution are in Asia.
East Asian industry is now more than nine times the size it was in 1965, and
emissions of industrial and toxic pollutants have increased exponentially.
The report suggests a number of remedial measures, including pricing to
limit the output of pollutants, vigorous enforcement of legislation, and
public disclosure requirements to embarrass polluters.

FRANCE
The cartoon on the front page of Saturday's Le Monde said it all. It showed
a bride and groom brawling outside a town hall. Her dress emblazoned with
'Volvo' and his suit with 'Renault'. In the background, two gleeful Japanese
businessmen crack open a magnum of champagne.
Le Monde had no doubt whom to blame for last week's debacle when Volvo's
shareholders vetoed its long-planned merger with Renault, the French
state-controlled car company. The Swedes themselves were the butt of its
fury. 'The people of Sweden would do well to reflect on the consequences of
the failure of the merger for the future of their country in Europe,' it
thundered.
Liberation, the liberal-left daily, blamed one Swede in particular - Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, who last week resigned last week as chairman of Volvo when the
merger collapsed.
' 'PG' is loathed by the Swedish business community, and the main reproach
against him is his love of France,' it said.
However, the paper also blamed the French authorities for their 'lack of
tact' during the negotiations: 'To the Swedes, France is the most
nationalistic and protectionist European country, as illustrated by its
stance on Gatt,' said Liberation.
Even France-Soir, the racy evening paper, agreed. It suggested that Volvo's
shareholders, alarmed by the recent fiasco of the Air France dispute, had
been frightened by the prospect of their company falling into the clutches
of the French government.
As for the future. . .
Les Echos, the financial daily, mooted Fiat of Italy as a possible partner
for Renault, while La Tribune Desfosses sketched a darker scenario for Volvo
by warning that 'its new partner will probably be a predator, to whom the
Swedes will no longer be in a position to say No.'

regulations are being overhauled in line with those in the European Union is
not getting much of a hearing in the domestic press.
The government has not 'challenged' the unions, it has 'declared war' on
them, said ABC, the big conservative daily, conveying a message of
watch-this-space for sustained industrial unrest. For good measure, it added
that the reform programme was 'far from being a global solution to the real
problems of the economy'.
The young El Mundo went one further. Accusing the government of running
roughshod over accepted political norms, it trumpeted: 'The government
unilaterally breaks the labour framework of the (post-Franco political)
transition.' El Mundo also firmly backed the unions with its message that
they have a duty to retaliate - which they intend to do, with a 24-hour
national stoppage next month.
El Pais, the top-selling newspaper and normally a stalwart supporter of the
government, put the final nail in the coffin. Alone among the press, it
discovered that the cabinet was divided over the reforms. Its scoop was that
the interventionist and regulatory ministers had kept the free-marketeers in
the cabinet at bay and made the reforms less liberal than had originally
been intended.
IVORY COAST
The Ivorian press has had a new lease of life with the declining health of
its octogenarian president, Mr Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Many dailies and
weeklies (21 in all) have surfaced since the president returned from a Swiss
cancer clinic in November, and are being financed by rivals for the
presidential succession. Newspapers are crammed with political machinations
and debate, but they are strangely silent on the most critical question of
all: Mr Houphouet-Boigny's state of health.
'Is he dead, is he alive?' asks Notre Temps (Our Times), the most outspoken
of Abidjan's weeklies. It does not know. Mr Houphouet- Boigny has not been
seen since his return. He has not spoken to the nation; there are no health
bulletins, indeed no announcements at all, from his palace.
Ivorians, however, are sure that they are witnessing the end of a era. The
collapse of commodity prices has impoverished the world's largest cocoa
producer, and tough negotiations with the International Monetary Fund were
being predicted by the opposition daily, La Voie.
The government mouthpiece, Fraternite Matin, still finds cause to celebrate
33 years of 'Bridges, Roads and Schools' in a special pullout prior to
independence day tomorrow. It wishes Mr Houphouet-Boigny a speedy recovery
and prints many photos of the president looking relaxed and healthy in
happier times.
Most papers, however, are devoting their attention to the political battle
between Mr Alassane Ouattara, the prime minister, and Mr Henri Konan Bedie,
the speaker of parliament, both of whom aspire to replace the ailing leader
until elections in 1995. Racist overtones have alarmed the 4m immigrants
(one-third of the population) who live in the Ivory Coast.
In the wake of anti-immigrant riots last month, a headline in Le Belier (The
Ram) screamed: 'A foreigner to be head of state? NEVER'. The article
attacked the prime minister, who is half Burkinabe and was educated in
Burkina Faso and the US. It called on 'patriots of pure blood to denounce
Ouattara's attempted constitutional coup'. Newspapers supporting the prime
minister attack the Bedie camp as 'fascists'. Given that both men belong to
the ruling party, their duel marks an ignominious end to a regime whose
mottoes were 'dialogue and brotherhood'.
BRAZIL
The homecoming of Brazil's most wanted fugitive, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias,
accused of corrupt fund raising for ex-President Fernando Collor, has
generated intense press coverage.
Mr Farias, who was arrested in Thailand last week, was subjected to
Brazilian press overkill. The Folha de Sao Paulo, the country's most popular
broadsheet, published a plan of the Thai prison which housed 'PC', as he is
generally known, and then a minute-by-minute summary of his 21-hour flight
back to Brazil. TV Globo also dwelt at length on the flight, highlighting Mr
Farias' request for a whisky and ice.
Such blanket coverage reflects popular anger at the corruption allegations
which forced the resignation of Mr Collor last year. Brazil now faces a
potentially far-reaching investigation into the country's Congress, where
over 30 politicians have been accused of taking bribes for helping approve
construction contracts in the government's budget.
Zero Hora, a tabloid based in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, led
on Saturday with the headline: 'He's back] And now he threatens to talk',
referring to suggestions from Mr Farias' family that he has information on
politicians and businessmen which could be delivered to the tax authorities.
In the present atmosphere of paranoia among politicians facing a seemingly
endless stream of corruption allegations, these threats are taken seriously.
But there is also an increasing sense that, with Congress discredited and
the press in full cry, radical groups will capitalise on the uncertainty for
their own ends.
COLOMBIA
Drug chief Pablo Escobar had been a 'bad news' front-page personality since
the murder of justice minister Rodrigo Lara in 1984. Colombia's papers
competed to celebrate his death with striking headlines and editorials such
as 'The end of a nightmare' and 'At last he fell'.
The headline 'Relief throughout the country' also reflected a sense of
relief among the press: Escobar was charged with the murder of the editor of
El Espectador, one of the main national dailies, and the paper's offices
were bombed. Escobar also organised the kidnapping of several journalists,
one of whom was killed.
The special task force which pursued Escobar around Medelln for more than a
year - and was criticised for not catching up with him sooner - received
generous coverage, as well as medals.
Sensitive to foreign opinion, the Bogota papers devoted considerable space
to monitoring how the world's press registered Escobar's death.
Congratulations from the US were prominently displayed.
The good news theme was continued by economic writers, who highlighted the
rise in share prices, and predicted that the removal of Escobar would make
Colombia more attractive to foreign investors.

<TEXT>
New York's 42nd Street may see a return of the streetcars that disappeared
half a century ago.
The city has started public consultations on a Dollars 75m regeneration
scheme including building a 2.2-mile line running the length of the street
from one side of Manhattan island to the other.
Years ago the street was famous for the shows that put it at the heart of
New York's night life, but now much of it is run-down and sleazy, and lined
with pornography shops.
The 1933 film musical, in which the leading lady in a Broadway show is
indisposed and a chorus becomes a star, made the street famous around the
world.
The 42nd Street Development Corporation, a non-profit-making group that has
been working with the city to restore the street to its former glory,
believes the tram line might play an important part in improving the
street's image.
New York's Department of Transportation is backing the scheme because it
believes the trams would provide an attractive and environmentally friendly
means of shifting the many people who travel along 42nd Street each day.
The Port Authority Bus Terminal and Grand Central Station lie along the
route. At present most people use buses or the subway.
The city planners believe the project will be self-financing and can be
built by the private sector at no cost to the taxpayer. Four consortiums
have pre-qualified for the competition to design, build, operate and
maintain the line. The trams may start running in 1996 if the project
survives the public consultation. But many fear that it will prove an
expensive white elephant.

Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said early today that the
government was not considering an economic stimulus package, William Dawkins
and agencies report from Tokyo.
His announcement to the budget committee of the lower house of parliament
came as stocks suffered a sharp fall in early trading, with the Nikkei
average down more than 600 points at about 16,830.
Mr Hosokawa also said that Japan's past economic stimulus measures,
including a growth-oriented budget for the current fiscal year ending March
31 1994, were certain to promote economic recovery.
Last week, Mr Kazuo Aichi, in charge of policy for the Japan Renewal party,
the coalition partner responsible for economic policy, said the seven-party
coalition had agreed on the need to take some action to boost the economy
around December 7.
But the package began to look increasingly unlikely yesterday when plans hit
delays due to the coalition's hectic schedule. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister
for international trade and industry, said on Japanese television that the
government was discussing no such plans and that it must now give top
priority to the supplementary budget required to finance part of the
Y6,150bn (Pounds 38.7bn) pump-priming package launched in September.

<TEXT>
A diplomatic row between Malaysia and Australia over remarks by Mr Paul
Keating, Australia's prime minister, about Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his
Malaysian counterpart, intensified over the weekend, Kieran Cooke reports.
Mr Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Malaysia's foreign minister, said a letter sent by
Mr Keating attempting to explain his remarks had not helped ease tensions.
'The letter. . . was not a letter coming from a person with any repent or
regret over what had happened,' said Mr Abdullah.
'What most disappointed us was that he did not say he was sorry in the
letter and in fact showed no conciliatory attitude. . . Anything can happen
after this.'
Mr Keating had described Dr Mahathir as 'a recalcitrant' for not attending
last month's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle.
Several government departments in Malaysia have already taken action against
Australia and Australian businessmen have said trade running at nearly
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year could be jeopardised. Malaysia has become
one of Australia's more important export markets recently and Australian
companies have been investing heavily in Malaysia's fast-growing economy.

The judge in the Singapore trial of five people accused of breaking the
island republic's Official Secrets Act (OSA) by prematurely disclosing an
official economic growth estimate has ruled that the prosecution has failed
to make a case against one of the accused, but invited the attorney general
to bring an amended charge.
Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank,
had been accused of communicating an official 1992 second-quarter economic
growth estimate of 4.6 per cent to two economists, who are alleged to have
then shared it with a journalist, whose editor published it.
All have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry penalties of a
maximum of two years in jail or a SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 840) fine or both.
After a trial which has so far lasted for 24 days, the judge said the
prosecution, led by Singapore's attorney general, had not substantiated its
case against Mr Shanmugaratnam on the charge of communicating the growth
figure. But the judge then invited the attorney general to bring an amended
charge of negligence against the economist. In a case which has intrigued
and concerned Singapore's financial community, the prosecution's case has
centred on what did, or did not, happen at a meeting in Mr Shanmugaratnam's
office at the MAS in June last year.
Today the court is due to hear from prosecution and defence on how they wish
to proceed in view of the new charge against Mr Shanmugaratnam, after which
the judge is expected to decide if the four other accused have cases to
answer.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Crackdown threatened for Jewish settlers: Violence grows

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's cabinet yesterday vowed to crack down on violence by Jewish
settlers opposed to Israeli-Palestinian peace after the most violent week
since the accord was signed in September.
An increasing cycle of tit-for-tat violence by Israeli and Palestinian
extremists, united in their desire to sabotage the peace process, has
overshadowed the visit by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who
yesterday vowed to 'energise' stalled peace talks between Syria and Israel.
Over the weekend, Israeli settlers living around occupied Hebron shot into
crowds of Palestinians, some of whom were throwing rocks. In another
incident, a settler fired at an Arab taxi. At least six Palestinians were
wounded in the weekend violence in Hebron and one died yesterday in
hospital.
In an apparent revenge attack, a Palestinian guerrilla belonging to the
extremist Islamic Jihad group yesterday attacked a bus near Tel Aviv. One
Israeli wounded in the battle later died in hospital and the guerrilla was
shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Crowds of Israeli's gathered around the
Palestinian's body shouting 'Death to Arabs'.
Since the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord was signed in September at least
33 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.
Cabinet ministers, many of whom have criticised the government for not
taking firmer measures, attacked the wave of violence by settlers, accusing
them of terrorism, murder and other illegal acts to disrupt the peace
process. Mr Moshe Shahal, police minister, and Gen Ehud Barak, army chief of
staff, promised tougher measures to curb settler violence and the use of
force against law-breakers.
Other ministers threatened to review the right of settlers to carry weapons.
At least five settlers involved in the weekend incidents in Hebron were
arrested and police officials said they were looking for others.
Mr Christopher, who flew to Damascus yesterday for talks with President
Hafez al-Assad of Syria, called for an end to the violence but made it clear
that he was concentrating his Middle East shuttle diplomacy on trying to
achieve a breakthrough in stalled talks between Israel and Syria over the
Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967.
Mr Christopher, who hopes to carry messages between Damascus and Jerusalem,
was expected to offer Mr Assad an improvement in ties with the US in return
for concessions to Israel and a written Syrian clarification of the nature
of peace with Israel it envisions.
He flies to Amman today to meet King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yassir Arafat,
Palestine Liberation Organisation leader. Tomorrow he will hold a second
round of meetings with Israeli leaders before considering a possible second
trip to Damascus.

<TEXT>
Malawi's government was yesterday trying to salvage credibility after a
weekend of violence which left a total of 32 people dead and more than 100
injured, Nick Young writes from Lilongwe.
Mr Hetherwick Ntaba, foreign minister, insisted that the government was in
control, and that the army had pledged support for President Hastings Banda
and the three-man presidential council which has held executive power since
Dr Banda was taken ill in October.
Statements from the Presidential Council claim the government endorsed army
assaults on bases of the Malawi Young Pioneers, the 2,000-strong armed wing
of the ruling Malawi Congress party.
During the operation, the party's Lilongwe headquarters were ransacked by
regular soldiers, the Lilongwe Youth Ministry was stormed and destroyed, and
one of Dr Banda's state residences, in the northern town of Mzuzu, was
reported to have been burned down.
State radio yesterday said Major General Isaac Yohane, the army commander,
claimed still to control the forces, although during the action regular
soldiers had told the Financial Times that they were taking orders from
Major John Msonthi, and that Maj Gen Yohane was under house arrest.

Mr Alassane Ouattara, Ivory Coast prime minister and presidential hopeful,
faces the unenviable task of winning International Monetary Fund support for
a tough programme of reform during a period of political turmoil in which
his own premiership is in jeopardy, Leslie Crawford writes from Abidjan.
A few weeks ago, France said it would no longer pay Abidjan's Dollars
350m-a-year debt service bill to the World Bank, or cover the recurrent
budget deficits. Paris also directed other former African colonies to the
IMF for continued financial help.
An IMF team arrived in Abidjan over the weekend to review the country's
dismal economic performance and discuss renewed assistance. A previous IMF
programme was abandoned last year because of non-compliance with economic
targets.
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's declining health has led to paralysis in
economic decision-making, as leaders of the Democratic party jostle for
power.
Private sector contractors complain that the government is not honouring
debts. The government is experiencing increasing difficulties in meeting its
monthly Dollars 85m (Pounds 57m) wage bill. Doctors, teachers and
electricians have been on strike over delays in the payment of salaries.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Isolated Buthelezi may stand down: Inkatha leader's
departure would transform S African politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and chief
rival of the African National Congress, is thinking about retiring.
So he told the Financial Times in an interview last week, during which he
outlined his objections to the constitution due to go the white-dominated
South African parliament for approval, possibly as early as today.
The constitution was agreed last month in essentially bilateral negotiations
between the ANC and its allies and the government. South Africa's immediate
future will depend on the chief's decision: will he sign the constitution?
If not, will he at least participate in the first all-race elections next
April 27, arguing that voters should elect him to see the constitution
improved? Will he oppose the poll, and risk seeing his base, Natal province,
plunged in ever greater violence?
Or will he, as he insists is possible, walk off the political stage where he
has held a prominent place for decades, and retire forever?
His departure would transform the political scene, not only in Natal
province but also in the townships near Johannesburg which have seen so much
recent carnage.
Not that he is personally responsible for the killings, which have left some
12,000 people dead in political violence since 1990; but Inkatha would be
crucially - probably terminally - weakened by the loss of the man who formed
the organisation as a cultural movement in the early 1970s, and who has led
it ever since. Chief Buthelezi is Inkatha; his lieutenants are weak men,
with little popular base. It is hard to see them taking over.
But Chief Buthelezi himself has become increasingly isolated in recent
months, and this too is hurting Inkatha.
Foreign embassies, previously friendly, have severely censured him for
pulling out of multi-party talks. Once the darling of the local business
community, he must have been shocked to learn that a recent poll showed his
support among leading businessmen had fallen to zero; and in a surprise move
at the weekend, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, who had never done more than
repeat the views of Chief Buthelezi, openly criticised Inkatha for pulling
out of talks.
Asked why he might retire, Chief Buthelezi replied: 'If people are messing
up the country and they think they are right, well let them do so. . . I am
sick and tired to the pit of my stomach with being blamed when I'm right.'
His said he held out 'no hope' that continuing talks between the government
and the right-wing Freedom Alliance (which includes Inkatha) would yield
agreement on constitutional amendments to meet his objections. These focus
on the powers of regional governments, and on the fact that regions can
raise no taxes without central government approval. The government appears
to have conceded some independent taxation powers for regions, but it was
not clear whether Chief Buthelezi's demand for 'exclusive' powers for
regions in other areas would be met.
The two sides have met almost constantly since the new constitution was
approved at the multi-party negotiating forum, trying to strike a deal
before it goes before parliament to become law.
Chief Buthelezi said he foresaw problems with the installation of the
Transitional Executive Council, due to meet for the first time tomorrow to
oversee government in the run-up to elections. 'Even if they've got their
army, I don't know how they actually implement it. . . because my people and
I don't accept it. We have the right to resist it,' he said, then added
'peacefully'.

<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, last night boarded a military
aircraft at Andrews airbase and headed for his second meeting within five
days with Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's trade commissioner. As he did so,
details began to emerge of the US-European Union trade liberalising deal
which both hope will open the way for completion of the seven-year Uruguay
Round of talks on global trade reform.
At the heart of a package likely to be unveiled in Brussels today will be
ambitious tariff-cutting measures, which also address European demands to
amend the Blair House accord limiting EU exports of subsidised farm goods.
As Europe's main farm exporter, France opposed this deal even before the ink
was dry when it was signed in Washington in November last year. In what is
likely to be seen as a significant climbdown, the US has agreed to:
Exempt Europe's existing 25m-tonne cereals stockpile from the Blair House
accord, which demands a 21 per cent cut in subsidised cereals exports over a
six-year period.
Switch the base year from which subsidised exports must be reined in from
the 1986-89 average, to 1992. Since subsidised EU cereal exports rose from
17m tonnes during the initial base period, to over 20m tonnes in 1992, the
switch greatly reduces the impact of the Blair House accord and, over the
six-year life of the agreement, allows Europe (principally France) to export
an additional 8m tonnes of cereals.
Extend from six to eight years the 'peace clause' under which the US would
not challenge Europe's export subsidy regime.
The price paid by the EU for these US concessions includes improved market
access for US pork, grains, dairy products, and 'specialty crops' - which
include nuts, vegetables, processed turkey and almonds.
But since these are not expected to yield significant new opportunities to
US exporters, EU negotiators have been forced to give ground by trimming
tariffs on a number of manufactured goods. Significantly, steel tariffs will
be cut to zero even though a Multilateral Steel Agreement is unlikely;
tariffs on wood, pulp and paper will also be cut to zero; semiconductor
equipment is likely to have tariff protection stripped to zero, while
semi-conductors themselves will retain protection averaging 3 per cent.
Tariff protection for non-ferrous metals - principally aluminium - will be
trimmed mainly among semi-finished goods, but not to zero.
A further concession from the US has apparently been made in shipping, where
negotiators have for the first time said they are willing to include ocean
shipping. Until just days ago, most negotiators expected the Uruguay Round
maritime agreement to be limited to ports and port services.
When Mr Kantor arrives in Brussels this morning, he will be joined by US
negotiators who have spent the past three days in Geneva wrestling with
disagreements. These include Europe's demands for 'cultural protection' for
its film and television industries; US pressure to weaken rules on
anti-dumping actions; and US calls for special treatment of financial
services and taxation. None of these issues was resolved last night.
However, as long as the two trade negotiators reach agreement today, the
pieces appear to be falling into place for the global Uruguay round deal to
be settled by December 15.

<TEXT>
A 77-year-old former head of state, Mr Rafael Caldera, yesterday proclaimed
his victory in Venezuela's presidential elections before thousands of
supporters as unofficial exit polls gave him a significant lead over his
rivals.
Mr Caldera, the pre-election favourite and candidate of a group of 17
parties, had secured between 30 and 35 per cent of the vote, according to
television exit polls. His margin of advantage over his three rivals
jostling for second place strongly suggested he would emerge as victor in
the official count.
Mr Claudio Fermn of the Democratic Action party, Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz of
the Christian Democrat Copei party, and Mr Andres Velasquez of the left-wing
Radical Cause party polled support in the low 20s per cent, according to
most exit polls.
Venezuelans also turned out in greater numbers than expected in the
elections for a new president, Congress and 22 state assemblies. Estimates
before the vote suggested as many as 35 to 40 per cent of voters would
abstain.
As the polling stations closed, there was no evidence of any disturbances
that would disrupt the elections.
The military said it uncovered last week a plot to derail the elections
involving active and retired officers in the armed forces and civilians.
If the results are confirmed, Mr Caldera will be 78 by the time he is
scheduled to take office, February 2. He broke away this year from Copei,
the party he helped found in 1946, to stand independently in the election.
President from 1969-74, he first stood in presidential elections in 1947. He
has vowed to reverse aspects of the economic reform programme introduced by
the administration of President Carlos Andres Perez, who was ousted this
year to allow his trial on corruption charges.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Paris hints at farm deal
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France may accept the provision in the controversial Blair House accord for
a 21 per cent cut in farm exports over a six-year period, provided the
impact of these cuts is reduced and Paris gets guarantees from Brussels.
The possibility of such a compromise was suggested by Mr Gerard Longuet,
France's trade minister, in a newspaper interview yesterday. It came as
pressure mounted on France to sign up to a Gatt accord, with both Sir Leon
Brittan, the chief European trade negotiator, and Mr Peter Sutherland,
director general of Gatt, coming to Paris to brief Mr Edouard Balladur,
prime minister, on the state of negotiations.
Mr Longuet, who is one of the more pro-Gatt ministers in the French
government, told the Journal du Dimanche: 'The Americans are now proposing
technical measures so as not to hit these subsidised European exports with
the brutality that was initially envisaged.'
France had been seeking to subtract existing food stocks and future food aid
from the volume of subsidised exports to which this 21 per cent cut would
apply, as well as postponing most of the reduction to the end of the decade.
'It is easier to make progress calculating in terms of millions of tonnes of
cereals exported, or on the contrary lost, between 1995 and 2001 than to get
hung up on a percentage (21 per cent) already accepted  - alas - by the
Brussels Commission,' Mr Longuet said.
'The final objective', he said, 'is that by the end of the agreement Europe
should guarantee to France that there will not be one extra hectare of land
taken out of production', beyond the set-aside provisions of the European
Union's current reform of its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
The Brussels Commission has claimed that the Blair House accord as
originally agreed would not require the EU to cut production any more than
it is already doing under CAP reform.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Query over missile treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US is asking Russia to agree to a new interpretation of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow it to test and deploy a theatre
missile defensive system without contravening the ban on defences against
strategic missiles.
US officials insisted that they were seeking to 'remove a long-standing
ambiguity', not to change the treaty or to adopt the broad interpretations
of the Reagan and Bush administrations, which claimed that the ABM treaty
allowed the deployment of space-based missile defences.
'Our intention is to make clear the distinction between theatre missile
defence not limited by the treaty and strategic defences that are limited,'
the State Department said.
While defences such as the Patriot system, used against Scud missiles during
the Gulf war, are allowed by the treaty, defences that could inter-cept
faster medium-range missiles could fall under the prohibition on national
defences.
The 1972 ABM treaty was intended to curb the arms race between the US and
the Soviet Union. Many arms control specialists remain firmly opposed to any
tinkering with the treaty.
If the clarifications sought by the Clinton administration were to count as
changes to the treaty, it might prove difficult to persuade the Senate to
ratify the revised treaty.

FT  06 DEC 93 / US seeks OECD foreign bribes ban: Many countries wary of
extending laws beyond their own frontiers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US will this week demand that other industrial countries follow its
example by outlawing bribery of foreign officials.
At a meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, US officials plan to propose a set of binding recommendations
to take much tougher measures against bribery. But other member countries
fear that by rejecting the less stringent recommendations that the OECD's
own task force has been working on for four years, the US may delay the
adoption of international standards.
While almost all countries outlaw bribes to their own officials, the US with
its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is the only country which criminalises
bribery of another country's officials. Most other countries are more wary
than the US about extending their laws outside their own territory.
US State Department officials complain that, apart from the negative effects
of bribery in the developing world, US companies bidding for contracts
around the world are set at a competitive disadvantage to companies
permitted to bribe.
Their proposals would require OECD countries to make bribery of a foreign
official a criminal offence, and ensure that companies were not allowed to
deduct the bribery costs from their taxable income.
Mr Dan Tarullo, assistant secretary of state for economic and business
affairs, told other OECD members at a recent meeting in Paris that the US
was disappointed with the 'lax approach' by the organisation's working group
on illicit payments.
'The most recent meeting of the group suggests that some members prefer to
minimise the problem and to dilute efforts to address it,' he said.
A senior US official said the OECD working group's recommendations amounted
to a shopping list from which countries could pick one or two measures, and
needed to be made more binding.
Officials from other OECD countries, however, say the US is seeking to raise
the stakes from the level it accepted some months ago. They fear this may
make it impossible to finish work on their proposals at their meeting on
Thursday and Friday.
Some officials speculated that the US initiative might even prevent the
completion of bribery rules in time for ministers to ratify them at next
June's OECD meeting.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Hopes dashed of subsidy curbs on shipbuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US hopes of negotiating multinational limitations on shipbuilding subsidies
were dashed last week when negotiations in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development were adjourned until next year.
Mr John Stocker, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America and one of
the prime movers behind the effort to reform shipbuilding subsidy, dismissed
as 'a ploy on the part of our trading partners' the alleged reason for delay
 -that the negotiators wanted to concentrate on completing the Uruguay
Round.
'They have succeeded in dragging their feet for 4 1/2 years, so why would
they change their behaviour now?' Mr Stocker said. He accused the
negotiators from Japan, South Korea, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the
European Union of wanting only 'to continue their market-distorting
shipbuilding and repair subsidy practices'.
The US wants to restrict direct and indirect subsidies to shipbuilders in
the form of loans, grants, debt forgiveness, tax benefits and research
funding above defined limits. The negotiators were reportedly unable to
agree on a permissible level for shipbuilding export financing or dumping of
ships in foreign markets.
The Clinton administration has set December 31, 1993, as a deadline for
agreement. The OECD talks were in response to an unfair trade petition filed
by US shipbuilders in 1989. Deadlines were set and ignored by the Bush
administration in 1990 and 1991.
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration has announced support for a 10-year
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 800m) shipbuilding subsidies programme to help the US
maritime industry survive the end of Cold War production cuts. The bill
provides Dollars 2.1m a year per US ship in operating subsidies;
construction differential subsidies will cover the difference in costs
between a US ship and a comparable foreign-built one.
Congress may force the administration to act against foreign subsidies early
next year, according to Mr Stocker. Both congressional houses may begin to
move legislation, introduced last year, which would levy fines on ships
entering US harbours if they are registered in, owned or controlled by
countries which subsidise shipbuilding.

<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Zilk, the Social Democratic mayor of Vienna, was seriously hurt by
a letter bomb last night.
He is the third and most prominent victim of a spate of letter bombs in
Austria this weekend, targeting people active in supporting refugees.
Mr Zilk has played a prominent role in seeking to build bridges with
Austria's Jewish community, the target of attacks by extreme right-wingers.
The city of Vienna has also made considerable efforts to help immigrants.
Two letter bombs exploded on Friday, the first injuring Ms Sylvana Meixner,
a Croat-born journalist with Austrian state-owned television. She presents a
weekly multi-lingual programme for immigrants.
The second injured Father August Janisch, a Roman Catholic curate, who has
campaigned for refugees.
Another bomb sent to the president of the Austrian branch of Caritas, the
Roman Catholic charity organisation, was intercepted by the police on
Saturday. Yesterday one addressed to the parliamentary leader of the
Austrian Greens party, Madeleine Petrovic, was defused by police.
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombs, but all were sent on the
same day from different parts of Lower Austria.
Mr Zilk was unaware of the danger, having only just returned from a visit to
Switzerland when he opened his mail at home.
The attack on the mayor will increase fears the bombs are the work of fringe
elements on Austria's far right, though Mr Michael Sika, general director
for public safety, said on Saturday that investigators were not discounting
the possibility the bombs were linked to the war in the former Yugoslavia.
There are more than 100,000 refugees, including 40,000 from Bosnia alone,
living in Austria.

The slump in production of Germany's manufacturing industry has bottomed out
and most sectors can expect some recovery in the coming year, according to
the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute.
Export orders, especially from China and south-east Asia, but also from the
US and eastern Europe, have already helped to stabilise output levels in the
hard-hit engineering, iron and steel industries, according to Ifo's latest
monthly report.
Hopes for a hesitant recovery cannot disguise the sharpness of the downturn,
which has sent manufacturing production down 7.5 per cent in 1993, after a
drop of 2 per cent in 1992 - overall, a drop of about one-tenth in output
since the peak of mid-1991.
Engineering production has fallen by 10 per cent in the past year alone and
investment goods manufacturers have seen a loss of 15 per cent.
However, Ifo researchers are relatively optimistic about the coming year,
thanks to an improvement in industrial orders, especially for export, and to
an end to the deeply pessimistic mood which has coloured all its surveys of
business opinion for the past two years.

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The former communist party in east Germany, the Democratic Socialist PDS,
was last night poised to deal a heavy blow to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrat CDU party in elections in Brandenburg. These were the
first local-government polls in the east since unification.
CDU federal general secretary Mr Peter Hintze said the PDS surge was
'frightening', and that the result for the CDU was 'absolutely
unsatisfactory'.
Brandenburg traditionally has had a strong socialist and communist base.
However, the CDU and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the federal
government, did not fare as badly as early opinion polls had predicted for
the state, which surrounds Berlin.
The vote is the first of many municipal and state elections which culminate
in federal elections next October.
Although local politics played a great part in yesterday's elections, the
vote will provide a barometer for Mr Kohl's future support. His CDU-led
coalition has been trailing in the opinion polls after several scandals and
amid speculation that it might soon fall apart. In Bonn, senior officials
shrugged off any suggestion that the coalition was strained to breaking
point.
But yesterday's elections, in which the governing Social Democrats (SPD) of
Brandenburg failed to increase their share of the vote despite the
popularity of their leader Mr Manfred Stolpe, suggests that the CDU and the
SPD, Germany's two main parties, may be edging towards a coalition after the
1994 elections.
After polls closed, computer projections carried out for Brandenburg radio
gave the CDU 21.9 per cent, nearly 8 points down from the previous state
elections in October 1990. FDP support was put at 5.4 per cent, just below
the federal election results, 3 points less than the state elections, and
trailing Greens/Alliance 90, which polled 6.3 per cent.
Support for the PDS rose to 20.2 per cent, nearly 7 points more than in the
state elections and 9 points more than the federal elections.
Brandenburg's governing Social Democrats held on to its broad base of
support with an estimated 34.3 per cent of the vote, 3 points less than in
the state elections and about 2 points more than in the federal elections.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Russians confident of rapid privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Proponents of privatisation have dismissed the possibility of interference
from Russia's parliament, which is due to be elected next week, and are
pressing ahead with plans to sell off major companies. The intention is to
place 80 per cent of Russia's industrial capacity in private hands by next
July.
Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, deputy privatisation minister, has said that large
enterprises being prepared for partial flotation include Gasprom, the state
gas-producing monopoly.
Although the state would retain control of the enterprise, 20 per cent of
shares would be offered to the public through vouchers.
Mr Vasiliev was confident that the State Property Committee, responsible for
the world's biggest and fastest privatisation campaign, would reach its 80
per cent target by July 1, the deadline for the use of privatisation
vouchers.
After that, state property would be sold for money only.
'The next three months will be crucial,' he said in a recent interview.
'Parliament won't be up to speed on privatisation in the first few months of
its existence. We have to use this time to sell as much as we can and work
as hard as we can.'
One area the property committee would enter for the first time is banking,
with plans to sell the state's remaining stakes in large banks, such as
Promstroibank, which used to finance the whole of Soviet industry, and
Rosselkhozbank, which still finances much of Russian agriculture.
It also planned to give commercial banks the opportunity to buy premises
they have leased from the central bank.
Parties competing in the election next Sundayhave attacked privatisation as
insensitive to the needs of individual sectors and companies.
In the next few months, the property committee expects progress in two
crucial areas: building a secondary market for share-trading, and helping
managers of privatised enterprises behave in a more market-oriented way.
A newly-created Securities and Exchange Commission, on which Mr Vasiliev
sits, is working on a system for independent share registries, which would
make it possible, say, for a worker in Vladivostok to sell shares to an
entrepreneur in Moscow.
At present, the only way to validate a share transaction is to go directly
to the privatised company for a change in its register, which it may refuse
if it does not like the new owner. A year from now, said Mr Vasiliev, Russia
would be ready for secondary trading on stock exchanges.
To help privatised companies, the state would provide business instruction
for factory directors.
Mr Vasiliev said this would include organising 'schools' on a sectoral
basis. Business experts would be invited, for instance, to a major chemical
plant to work directly with its managers, while directors of other chemical
plants attend.
Directors would then have to devise business plans of their own, and the
best investment strategies would qualify for financial support, including
funds from a Dollars 3bn package promised by the Group of Seven industrial
nations.
Although Mr Vasiliev said that foreign investment had been sluggish,
increasing numbers of foreign buyers had emerged after share purchases by
workers and staff. 'Privatisation has provided concrete owners with whom
investors can negotiate,' he said.
Mr Vasiliev added that 10 per cent of shares, or about Dollars 200m-Dollars
300m worth, which had been made available since January 1993 when the
privatisation of large-scale enterprises was launched, had since been
acquired by foreigners. 'This is less than, say, Hungary,' he said,
acknowledging the difficulties of Russia's business environment.
But he said promises of further investment were greater, amounting to
Dollars 2bn in the St Petersburg region alone.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strong, common European approach is the only way to tackle the EU's
problems of unemployment, lack of industrial competitiveness and sluggish
growth, the Belgian prime minister said yesterday.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, who will chair Friday's summit of EU leaders in
Brussels, warned member states against calling into question the value of
such an approach at the time when it was most needed.
'We have built up Europe, we have agreed the Maastricht treaty, and we are
part of a European Union: that's what we now have to use to face up to these
common problems,' he said on Belgian television.
Belgium, which holds the EU presidency, is likely to press for a
co-ordinated approach to the economic crisis, citing as an example its own
strict austerity plan.
'When there's a crisis, there's always a temptation to resolve the crisis by
a form of protectionism. . . There's always a sort of 'me first' reflex.
That's the wrong approach: when we're all in the same situation we will only
get out of it together,' said Mr Dehaene yesterday.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Delors unlikely to have the last word on EU jobs: Influences
shaping the Commission president's prescriptions for a post-industrial
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Jacques Delors presents his White Paper on employment, growth and
competitiveness to this week's EU summit in Brussels, many will view the
occasion as the last hurrah for the president of the European Commission.
That the 12 heads of government are ready to put their faith in Mr Delors is
a testimony to his reputation as the man with the long-term vision; but it
also reflects a certain desperation in the face of mass unemployment.
Next year, the number of people out of work in the European Union is
forecast to rise to more than 18m, the equivalent of the combined
populations of Belgium, Denmark and Ireland. No one expects Mr Delors to
produce a miracle cure; but some wonder whether his White Paper will produce
the prescriptions to tackle Europe's low growth, rising unemployment and
failure to create jobs.
The answer goes to the heart of what might be called the debate over the
future economic philosophy of the European Union. This debate pits the
Anglo-Saxon model of labour market deregulation, wage restraint, and curbs
on trade union power, against the more consensual model of social
partnership which has underpinned the post-second world war economic order
on the continent in Europe, but which is now under strain.
Early drafts of the White Paper have sent ambiguous signals about how far Mr
Delors is prepared to compromise on the social policies he has championed,
which were embodied in the Maastricht treaty. Broadly speaking, it is
possible however to pick out a few trends, starting within the Commission
which endorsed the final version in a special session yesterday.
The first school of thought is grouped inside Directorate General Two,
headed by Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish commissioner responsible for
economics. A former finance minister, Mr Christophersen is Mr Orthodoxy. He
stands for price stability; strict control on public finances; and an
average increase in real wages of one percentage point a year less than the
rise in productivity. This is about as near as DG-2 felt it could go in
supporting the notion of pricing people into work.
The second, activist, school is located inside Directorate General Five,
headed by Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner responsible for social
affairs and employment. Though Mr Flynn arrived in Brussels a year ago with
something of a conservative reputation, he has quickly absorbed DG-5's
social democratic agenda. This stresses the preservation of labour market
regulation and minimum wages, as well as the recent endorsement of
work-sharing as a source of new jobs, possibly supported by fiscal
incentives.
Mr Delors' own views are an intriguing cocktail. In one breath, he will
speak of 40m people in poverty in Europe and rail against the 'politics of
exclusion'. Minutes later, he will remind visitors that, as a former French
finance minister, he remains more popular among Christian Democrats than
among members of his own Socialist party.
Mr Delors retains an almost blind faith in new technology as a means of
restoring Europe's competitiveness. The White Book will therefore contain
images of a New Europe linked together through US-style 'information
highways', massive investment in roads, rail and telecommunications, and a
shift of funds away from consumption into research and development.
Mr Delors' message is that a new post-industrial age has arrived in Europe.
Thus, in 15 years, the number of non-active people will be high relative to
the number in work; much more flexible working patterns will be commonplace;
the right to permanent retraining should be universal. But he remains an
optimist. As he told members of the European parliament last week, the
essential element in tackling the competitiveness crisis is not the cost of
labour but the capacity to master technical change.
Senior Commission officials agree, but some fret that Mr Delors risks
blurring the question of labour market flexibility as the prerequisite for
job creation. This is not just a result of his own political leanings, but
arises also from the political constraints in the member states such as
Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, all of which face serious trade
union unrest this winter. 'The single biggest weakness in the White Book
will be the lack of a coherent message,' predicts one official.
In fairness, Mr Delors will reply that the political weakness of the
Commission means it has no option but to offer a menu of prescriptions. It
has no intention of putting forward Brussels-led legislation; member states
must pick what is best suited to national needs.
As such the White Paper is a work of transition; it is the first rather than
the last word in the debate.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Spending plans by Commission upset ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday approved spending of nearly Ecu124bn
(Pounds 165bn) on public works programmes over the next six years, including
a new plan to float 'Brussels bonds' to help to finance the projects.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, will present the plans to the
European summit on Friday, as part of his White Paper on employment and
growth, despite reservations among European finance ministers who were
meeting in Brussels last night.
Several ministers complained that Mr Delors had failed to produce a copy of
the White Paper; German officials expressed opposition to the notion of new
public borrowing to support infrastructure spending. 'It goes against our
policy of budgetary restraint,' said one Bonn official.
But Mr Edmond Alphandery, French finance minister, offered support for the
idea of additional finance to cover big road, rail, telecommunications and
environmental projects.
It remained unclear how finance ministers intend to integrate Mr Delors's
own non-binding White Paper with the legally binding but diluted version of
the macro-economic guidelines for the European Union, which were being
debated last night.
One official spoke of a 'power struggle' between the Commission and the
finance ministers who tend to look more to national rather than to
pan-European interests.
The Commission said yesterday that only Ecu7bn of the proposed annual
spending of Ecu20.6bn was new money. The rest has already been earmarked in
the budgetary guidelines approved last December at the European summit in
Edinburgh or through the European Investment Bank.
The Commission has identified trans-European network projects costing about
Ecu135bn. Officials believe these would improve European competitiveness by
strengthening the single market, but fear they could be delayed because
private banks and governments could object to the cost.
At the special session of the Commission yesterday, some members were said
to have criticised selective aspects of the White Paper which calls for
reforms in the labour market to make it easier to hire people, an effective
freeze on wages, and budget discipline.

FT  06 DEC 93 / SFO's powers may be widened in fraud battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent, and JOHN MASON, Law Courts
Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering increasing the responsibilities of the
embattled Serious Fraud Office as part of a shake-up in the battle against
white-collar crime.
The SFO would be enlarged to take on the most important cases currently
investigated by the Fraud Investigation Group, of the Crown Prosecution
Service.
The proposal reflects strong government support for the SFO in spite of the
growing criticism over its handling of a range of high profile trials.
The controversy mounted last week in the wake of the sentencing of disgraced
financier Roger Levitt to 180 hours of community service and the SFO's
admission that it had given privileged defence documents to the prosecution
in the case of fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir.
The government has set its face against dramatic changes at the SFO, such as
a switch to a single City regulatory body, along the lines of the US
Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a change it says is 'not on the
agenda'.
A small team of Whitehall officials led by a senior Treasury official is
reviewing all the SFO's cases, including the prosecutions of Mr Terry
Ramsden, the former head of Glen International which collapsed in 1987 with
losses of Pounds 142m, and big cases such as Blue Arrow and Guinness II.
The group, which began work in October, is expected to report within two
months. However, the government is confident it will show that the SFO
remains the most effective unit for fighting serious fraud.
Reverses are said to have been caused by a mixture of bad luck and
unexpected trial rulings which do not detract from the 'great skill' with
which the cases were handled.
The SFO is said to have received insufficient credit for its 59 per cent
conviction rate, or for successes such as the jailing of Mr Joseph Szrajber
and Mr Paolo Sorelli earlier this year for conspiring to defraud BP.
The exception is the case against Mr Nadir, former head of failed trading
company Polly Peck International, who is charged with theft involving Pounds
34m. Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney general, admitted on Friday that the SFO
wrongly released privileged documents to lawyers prosecuting Mr Nadir who
fled to northern Cyprus in May. The government view is that the documents
were mistakenly released by an official who was not sufficiently well
supervised.
Ministers are satisfied that Mr George Staples, the SFO's director, has
taken prompt action to overcome management weaknesses exposed by the Nadir
case.
In the longer term, the government is considering merging the Fraud
Investigation Group into the SFO to create a single agency to investigate
major fraud. A more likely option would be to transfer some of its larger
cases to the SFO, leaving the Fraud Investigation Group to deal with less
important matters.
The government is also pressing for greater co-operation between the SFO,
the CPS, the metropolitan police and City regulatory organisations.
The agencies have been told to establish formal structures to discuss large
cases, some of which could be handled by regulatory bodies rather than in
the courts.
A separate review has cleared the CPS of allegations it failed to prosecute
winnable cases.

FT  06 DEC 93 / US deal may lead to Gatt accord: Compromise on phasing in
subsidy cuts could help France to end world trade crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US compromise on the controversial Blair House accord limiting Europe's
exports of subsidised farm goods has paved the way for an agreement expected
today with the European Union on trade reform.
The agreement will put pressure on France to accept the accord, finally
bringing to a head the political crisis in Paris over the world trade talks.
Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, will this morning hold a special
cabinet meeting to decide France's position on the draft General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, which is expected to be presented to EU ministers
later in the day.
The US compromise on Blair House allows for a more gentle phasing in of the
timetable for cutting subsidised EU farm exports by 21 per cent over six
years. In what is likely to be seen as a significant climbdown, the US has
agreed to exempt the existing EU grain mountain of about 25m tonnes.
The US concessions will allow Europe to export an additional 8m tonnes of
grain a year. France, Europe's largest farm exporter, will be the main
beneficiary of the switch. After being briefed in Paris yesterday by Sir
Leon Brittan, the chief European negotiator and EU trade commissioner, and
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, Mr Balladur still warned
against 'the excessive optimism which has reigned in recent days and hours'.
Progress had been made, but problems remained for France in the agricultural
and audiovisual sectors, his spokesman said.
The agreement was endorsed in principle in Brussels last week by Sir Leon
and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Mr Kantor will return to
Brussels today after weekend consultations in Washington with President Bill
Clinton. Sir Leon's meeting with Mr Balladur, aimed at clearing the way for
a deal to be announced, followed the commissioner's talks on Friday with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The impression that France's political crisis over Gatt was finally coming
to a head was reinforced by Mr Balladur's decision to call in the presidents
of the National Assembly and the Senate for consultations last night. The
prime minister is expected to put any draft Gatt agreement for approval
before the French parliament, probably at the start of next week.
Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, took a tough line in radio and
television interviews last night, saying that he would want concessions on
tariffs, the agricultural and audiovisual sectors, and agreement on a
stronger future world trade organisation, before he could give France's
approval to any Gatt package in Brussels today. Mr Juppe is also
secretary-general of Mr Balladur's own RPR Gaullist party, which is the
closest politically to the French farm lobby.
But Mr Gerard Longuet, France's more pro-Gatt trade and industry minister,
earlier suggested that France was ready for compromise in the key area of
agriculture.
European negotiators expect to pay a price elsewhere in the Uruguay round
for winning concessions from the US on Blair House. They are expected to
reveal this week that tariffs protecting wood and paper products will be cut
to zero, while tariffs protecting semiconductors and non-ferrous metals will
also be pared back.
Part of the price may be concessions to the US on access to Europe's film
and television market, where France has fought for protection on cultural
grounds.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Volvo chief denies he betrayed Gyllenhammar over merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive of Volvo, yesterday denied he betrayed Mr
Pehr Gyllenhammar, who last week resigned as Volvo's chairman after Mr Gyll
led a management revolt against plans for a merger with Renault of France.
Mr Gyll in an interview with the Financial Times said: 'This is the worst
decision I have ever been involved in. It is a serious one, of course, but I
was prepared to take all the responsibility.'
The days leading up to Thursday's Volvo board meeting were fraught. Mr Gyll
decided a week ago that shareholder pressure meant the controversial merger
with Renault was unlikely to succeed.
But the crucial meeting was on Tuesday night when senior managers gathered
at Mr Gyll's home. After two hours of discussion the managers from Volvo's
car and truck divisions agreed the merger should not proceed.
The following day 25 managers signed a letter asking Mr Gyll to recommend
the board drop the merger plan. That day when Mr Gyllenhammar returned from
the US, Mr Gyll met him in private. He told him that the senior management
opposed the deal, which he believed was unlikely to be approved by
shareholders on December 7.
The following morning Mr Gyll warned his wife: 'This could be my last board
meeting.'
'I didn't know when I went into the board meeting what the outcome would
be,' he explained. 'They could have fired me. I could have been shooting
myself in the head.'
Mr Gyll reiterated his desire to continue a three-year old alliance with
Renault, saying joint projects could still be constructed on a 50-50 basis.
He said he would be talking with Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chief
executive, as early as last night, although he acknowledged time was needed
for the two sides 'to cool down'.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Left set to win power in Italy's municipal elections: Former
communists reap benefits from broad-based alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leftwing alliances looked set last night to win control of Italy's main
cities in the second round of voting in local elections.
Early returns indicated that strong challenges from the populist Northern
League in north Italy and from the neo-fascist MSI in the centre and south
had been defeated. Mayors backed by alliances controlled by the former
communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS) were winning in Genoa, Naples,
Rome, Trieste and Venice.
Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader who has sought to present the party as
responsible and sensitive to the markets' concerns about a left-dominated
government, declared that the local elections marked an historic turning
point. He said they had finally broken the power of the traditional parties
that have ruled post-war Italy.
'This country has a mature left that wants to govern,' he said.
However, the strong performance of the MSI places the party in a powerful
position to dominate the political agenda on the right in the run-up to the
general elections. Nevertheless, much of the MSI support came from
disillusioned voters who formerly backed the Christian Democrats and the
Socialists in government.
In Naples, Mr Antonio Bassolino, the PDS candidate, won 55.6 per cent of the
final vote compared with 44.4 per cent for Ms Alessandra Mussolini, the
candidate of the MSI and granddaughter of wartime dictator Benito Mussolini.
In Rome, where the MSI was also involved in a tight battle, Mr Gianfranco
Fini, the party's leader, was in second place behind Mr Francesco Rutelli,
the Green candidate backed by the PDS.
Projections from early returns credited Mr Rutelli with around 53 per cent
of the vote, against 47 per cent for Mr Fini.
The result is a vindication of the PDS policy of forging broad alliances,
and gives the party a strong position for the general elections probably due
in March.
Under electoral laws approved in March, the winning alliance behind the
mayoral candidate has the right to 60 per cent of the council seats.
Yesterday in the second-round run-off, 129 mayoral seats were being
contested with nearly a quarter of the electorate involved.
In Genoa, Trieste and Venice, the Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi lost
out to PDS-backed coalitions, scoring just over 40 per cent of the vote.
However, in all three cities, the League is the largest single party.
The same applies to the MSI in Naples and Rome. Mr Fini said he was proud of
having done so well against an alliance of left-wing interests. 'I was alone
against everybody,' he said. Ms Mussolini, for her part, stressed the need
for the right to muster its forces for the general election.
Mr Bossi admitted for the first time that his movement would now have to
reconsider its policy on alliances. The League has consistently rejected
alliances but has seen in these elections that it is not enough to be the
largest single party to gain power.
Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said the elections were a sign of the country
pulling together despite the turmoil wrought by the arrest or implication of
3,000 politicians and business figures in corruption probes.

FT  06 DEC 93 / Brandenburg vote set to deal blow for Kohl support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
East Germany's former communist party of Democratic Socialists was last
night poised to deal a heavy blow to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats in elections in Brandenburg, the first local-government polls in
the east since unification.
However, the CDU and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the federal
government, did not fare as badly as early opinion polls had predicted for
the state, which surrounds Berlin and flanks Poland.
The vote is the first in a marathon round of municipal and state elections
which culminate in federal elections next October.
Although local politics played a great part in yesterday's elections, the
vote will provide a barometer for Chancellor Kohl's future support. His
CDU-led coalition has been trailing in the opinion polls after several
scandals and amid speculation that it might soon fall apart.
In Bonn, senior officials shrugged off any suggestion that the coalition was
strained to breaking point. 'We want this coalition, and we want it to keep
its majority in the parliamentary election' in October 1994, Mr Wolfgang
Schauble, head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary faction, said in an interview
with Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
'Anyone who believes the coalition between the CDU and the FDP is finished
is completely fooling themselves,' he added.
An exit poll conducted for Brandenburg radio by Infas, an opinion poll
company, last night gave the CDU 20.2 per cent, nearly 10 points down from
the previous state elections in October 1990, and a decline of 16 points
compared with the Brandenburg vote in the federal elections that December.
FDP support was put at 6 per cent, the same as the federal elections but 3
points less than the state elections.
Opinion polls last week had suggested that Mr Kohl's governing coalition
would, combined, obtain only 12 per cent.
Support for the PDS rose to 22.1 per cent, nearly 7 points more than the
state elections and 9 points more than the federal elections. However, its
support is unlikely to be carried throughout the eastern states next year.
The final count, expected early today, while representing a warning to Bonn,
may indicate that Mr Kohl's government might be able to weather the storm
after last week's financial scandal among the conservative-led government in
Saxony-Anhalt and the withdrawal by Mr Steffen Heitmann, the Chancellor's
chosen candidate for the presidency.
Brandenburg's governing Social Democrats, led by Mr Manfred Stolpe, an
easterner, held on to its broad base of support in spite of high
unemployment. It was estimated to have received nearly 36 per cent of the
vote, just 2 points less than it received in the state elections and 3.1
points more than the federal elections.
The Greens received an estimated 6 per cent of the vote, the same as in the
federal elections.
If the exit poll is reflected throughout the night's counting, in which 58
per cent of the 1.9m eligible voters turned out, then Mr Kohl will have been
spared a far worse result.
However, Mr Thomas Klein, general secretary of the CDU in Brandenburg, last
night said the scandal in Saxony-Anhalt, which involved west German
ministers receiving excessive salaries, 'was a big problem'.
Brandenburg has traditionally had a strong socialist and communist base.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Personal alcohol imports up to Pounds 400m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cross-channel shoppers are spending about Pounds 400m a year on personal
imports of beer, wine and spirits.
A report yesterday by Verdict, the retail consultancy, says that increased
allowances of personal imports of duty-paid drinks this year have had 'a
dramatic impact'.
Although the chancellor did not increase the duty on beer or spirits in the
Budget, the outlook for UK off-licences is not bright, Verdict says. Price
competition has intensified in the Pounds 6.5bn take-home market and profit
margins of specialist shops are wafer thin.
Supermarkets have benefited most from growth in the take-home trade and now
claim 56 per cent of sales. Off-licences are attempting to match prices but
only the biggest chains, Thresher and Victoria Wine, have the power to
compete on price for a prolonged period, the report says.

The World Bank took action last month to prevent construction of a foreign
toxic waste dump in the Congo in an unusual move that may be a harbinger of
a more active role by the group protecting the environment, Reuter reports
from Washington.
Bank environmental director Mohammed El-Ashry told reporters yesterday that
the lending organisation wrote to the president of the Congo to alert him to
'credible reports' that a Belgian company planned to build a toxic waste
dump in the country.
He denied that the Bank was seeking to be a global 'cop' policing the world
environment. El-Ashry, a former environmental activist, said that he was
ready to repeat the exercise with other countries if the Bank received
similar information.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Science through the looking glass: The Nature of Things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Step with Alice through the looking glass and glance around the mirror image
world. Though everything looks familiar, the air is full of strange and
exotic scents.
Peel an orange - it smells and tastes of lemon. Chew some spearmint gum -
instead of a minty tang, a caraway flavour fills your mouth. Then sip some
cool fresh milk . . . and spit it out quickly; the taste is quite
disgusting. Alice was quite right to warn Kitty: 'Perhaps looking-glass milk
isn't good to drink.'
Lewis Carroll wrote Through the Looking Glass soon after Victorian
scientists discovered that most organic chemicals - the building blocks of
life - exist in identical mirror image forms. Like a pair of right and left
hands, they cannot be superimposed.
The critical observation had been made in 1848 by Louis Pasteur while
drinking red wine. He analysed the crystals of tartaric acid deposited on
the surface of the bottle and managed to separate them into two mirror image
forms. One rotated a beam of polarised light in a clockwise direction and
the other turned it anticlockwise (this 'optical activity' is the classic
test for chiral chemicals).
Pasteur went on to make a prescient comment: 'The universe is dissymmetrical
. . . life is dominated by dissymetrical actions. I can foresee that all
living species are primordially, in their structure, in their external
forms, functions of cosmic dissymetry.'
Dissymetry has become an established field of science, under the name of
chirality (from the Greek word for hand). As scientists discovered the
molecular structure of life, they came to realise that almost all biological
processes are chiral. The chemicals that make up living cells are made up of
one or other of the two possible mirror image forms, but not both; for
example all natural amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, are
left-handed.
Many scientists have reflected on the origins of biological dissymetry,
without coming to any clear conclusion. No one really knows what first
skewed amino acids in the left-handed direction. But Pasteur was probably
right in holding 'cosmic dissymetry' responsible. Indeed the answer to
chirality - as to many other scientific mysteries - is probably hidden in
the first few micro-seconds of the universe after its formation in the Big
Bang, when our familiar laws of symmetry did not apply.
Whatever may have happened billions of years ago, it is clear now that our
cells respond differently to each configuration of any chiral molecule. Take
for instance the molecule called carvone; its left-handed form produces a
caraway flavour while the right-handed image gives spearmint.
Over the past decade or so, chiral chemistry has begun to move from academic
research into industry. Its biggest impact will be in pharmaceuticals.
Ordinary chemical reactions produce a 50:50 mixture of mirror image
molecules.
Frequently, however, only one is a beneficial drug; the other is at best
inactive and may be positively harmful. A tragic example was thalidomide:
pharmacists discovered too late that its left-handed form caused birth
defects, while the right-handed molecule gave the desired sedative effect.
Under pressure from regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration,
the pharmaceutical industry is quickly building up an array of techniques
for making pure left or right-handed drugs.
As well as developing entirely new chiral chemicals, drug companies are
examining well established medicines that are currently made as mixtures, to
see whether they would benefit from reformulation in pure form.
The most ambitious chiral synthesis so far is the creation of an artificial
protein from 99 right-handed amino acids at Scripps Research Institute in
California. The protein is the mirror image of a natural enzyme found in
HIV, the Aids virus.
Creation of a whole mirror image virus might be possible within a few
decades. The prospect is intriguing but not alarming, such an organism could
not survive outside the laboratory. It would starve in the real world, as
surely as Alice would have if she had lingered long through the looking
glass.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Private View: The Treasury's top mandarin answers back - Sir
Terry Burns, the 'invisible hand' behind the Government's economic strategy,
reviews past errors and says the Treasury will do better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day he gets on his bike, props a chapter of Trollope on the handlebars
and pedals another bit of road from John O'Groats to Land's End. 'I'm nearly
there now,' he said proudly.
But that is not why Sir Terry Burns was looking so cheerful this week -
after all, it is only an exercise bike on a statistical journey. No, he was
beaming (cautiously) at press and stock market reaction to the first unified
Budget under a new British chancellor, the fifth he has served.
During 11 years as chief economic adviser - he was only 35 when appointed -
and nearly three as permanent secretary to the Treasury, this mandarin son
of a coalmining mechanic has been regarded as the invisible hand behind the
Conservative government's economic strategy. Known to his staff as plain
'Terry', the permanent secretary is affable. He has a charming smile, used
to good effect. As he walked about the big, overheated office, I was struck
by a resemblance to his friend John Major. (Or is it the other way round?)
Sir Terry talks volubly but in a methodical, literal way with an
intelligence that seemed analytical rather than imaginative. Perhaps he was
more apprehensive than he looked.
Tuesday's Budget, I said, has been called pragmatic, non-doctrinal and
political as well as tough. Does that mean there is less of you in it than
usual?
He baulked at the question. He had advised on strategy, not detail, he said;
from a macro-economic point of view it was 'very much the chancellor's
Budget' but also 'very much in line with what we as an institution are happy
with.'
Sir Terry wanted to talk about his plans for sharpening the Treasury's
management. I wanted to hear him talk about the big policy mistakes - from
Lawson's inflationary boom to Lamont's ERM bust. The two subjects seemed in
some way connected.
He has engaged Wendy Pritchard, a management consultant, to help him and his
officials concentrate their minds. They want to repair their relationship
with spending departments which complain of meddling, to consult more with
outsiders who say they are out of touch, and make the Treasury a more
agreeable workplace for the UK's best and brightest.
You want to correct the Treasury's image as an introverted, elitist
organisation?
'It's not really an image I am after. What I am after is that we should do
our job better. The real question is how far the criticisms of the Treasury
are justified. In some respects I think they have been. It has been a
relatively introverted organisation because it conducts most of its business
through intermediaries.'
Have you yourself become a prisoner?
'No. I don't think I have become in any sense a prisoner. I continue to go
out a good deal. I have maintained a good many of my contacts and I think
I've got quite good intelligence of what's going on.'
The 1980 appointment of Terry Burns, a moderate monetarist and forecasting
specialist from the London Business School, was a minor sensation. He was
the young outsider the new Tory government needed to challenge the dominant,
neo-Keynesian line. Now, in Major's classless society, he is the
Establishment. Burns does not agree. The fact that he defends his
department, he said, does not mean he has lost his critical faculties.
Treasury officials work hard - perhaps inefficiently hard. Sir Terry's
contacts with the real world include golf on Saturday mornings, watching
Queens Park Rangers play football every other Saturday afternoon, and
playing music in a recorder quintet.
Jazz or classical?
He answered seriously: 'No, it's classical recorder. We play a wide variety
of music.'
When not bicycling with Trollope he reads golf and computer magazines - and
mountains of paperwork. Last weekend he went back to the north east where he
was born to receive an honorary degree from the University of Sunderland.
(His own degree is from Manchester).
I observed that the last coal pit in the Durham coalfield is closing. Does
the permanent secretary of the Treasury feel any connection to that event?
'I don't feel very closely connected because what has happened to the coal
industry has been very largely to do with world trends, to do with
technology, to do with the relative costs of producing energy by one means
as opposed to another.
'On the other hand when I look at what it is they have been doing to try to
compensate for that, then you get into an area more closely related to what
we are doing. And the overwhelming sensation I get is to be taken aback by
the extent of the change. I find it quite staggering to think that has all
happened in the time since I left the north east.'
Economist colleagues have complained that they no longer know what Terry
Burns believes in. He says that is because he has been so long out of the
public arena. His views, he said, were formed between 1972 and 1975, a
period that included the Heath U-turn, the collapse of fixed exchange rates,
the trial and failure of incomes policy, the Barber boom, the three-day week
and high inflation. The combination of crude stimulus and incomes restraint
while searching for competitiveness via currency depreciation was 'a very
dangerous brew. You had to see inflation as a monetary phenomenon, and it
had to be attacked by monetary policy.'
Once a monetarist, always a monetarist?
'Well, I would say that most of the people I know engaged in the broad
subject of macroeconomics have changed their views quite a lot over the last
20 years. I've never been at all happy with this idea that you belong to
schools. I've never regarded myself as belonging to a particular school,
being a card-carrying member and surrounding yourself with only people who
think alike.'
Monetarism was 'absolutely not' a right wing phenomenon: he had always seen
the danger of supporting the economics of any one political party.
'I have never had any involvement in my adult life with a party. I have
always tried to incorporate within my own views the lessons from experience.
How could you help but shift your views when you look at the experience and
the variety of things that have happened?'
It was not, he said, that economists had moved from one, monetarist pole
towards another, Keynesian one. Rather they had converged from different
starting points in a triangular fashion. 'Maybe there is greater consensus
about these matters than there has been for some time.'
You have been accused of making the mistakes for which we are now paying, I
said: for failing to foresee the boom, failing to stop it quickly enough,
focusing on single indices, for the ERM fiasco, for your attitude to
manufacturing industry and, one could add, for losing two Chancellors from
under your wing. Do you accept any of those things as your personal
mistakes?
'Well, with some of them, obviously, I did contribute. Whether they have had
the influence that is sometimes suggested I think is another matter. It's
quite true that the forecast I was involved with in 1987-88 failed to see
the scale of the boom, failed subsequently to see the scale of the
recession, and, you know, there is no doubt about that.
'But the forecasting industry generally over the last six or seven years has
had a very difficult time, and that is not only in this country. The
Treasury forecasts are no worse than forecasts generally - in fact, if
anything, slightly better.
'Obviously one would have wished that one could have foreseen the future
with a greater degree of accuracy. Had we been able to do so, I think that
it is likely that policy would have been a bit better and the ups and downs
wouldn't have been as great.'
Were things made worse because the government and its advisers were hooked
on certain key indicators and not prepared to take a rounded view of the
real economy?
'No, no. Economies have cycles. You are never going to be able to eliminate
them. When you have exogenous (outside) pressures of the kind we had during
that period, they turn out after the event to have had a substantial effect.
There are things, with the best will in the world, you will never see. And
even if you can, it is far from evident that you can necessarily correct
them.
'It must be your ambition to try to foresee these events and to take evasive
action. But what you must not do is set impossible standards, or to assume
that all change is the direct consequence of having failed to do something
that should have been done, which was to see the future perfectly.'
Sir Terry talked of accountability. By this he did not mean that officials
like himself should resign if they get their sums wrong but be readier to
explain their arithmetic in public. The question of how much responsibility
was the adviser's and how much the minister's was 'very difficult'.
I said: It's reported that you once boasted the government always did what
you told it . . .
'That's not . . . '
. . . and that if anything went wrong with the British economy it would be
down to you.
'No. I certainly didn't . . . I did not say that. I would not say that
because it is not remotely my . . . perception of what has happened. That is
an enormously vain thing to say. I don't know why it is that people have the
view that somehow ministers are weak puppets in the hands of enormously
strong officials.
'What I may have said in the past is that I have always been listened to.'
I asked him if his beliefs had changed.
'When you see the failure of both yourself and colleagues and others to be
able to predict things, you do tend to see the process as more complicated
and one is less given to strident views about what is obviously right or
wrong. You see it increasingly as a very risky business.'
Had experience made him more pragmatic in his advice to the chancellor? Was
he more aware of the consequences?
'I think you tend to think of a greater variety of possible outcomes and
ways in which things may go wrong - where the dangers are. Whether it is a
good thing or a bad thing I'm not sure, but it is a characteristic of people
that as they age everything is more complicated and the rights and wrongs of
particular courses of action are much more difficult to identify in an
unambiguous way.'
Sir Terry was anxious to point to successes: privatisation, deregulation of
the financial markets, the post-ERM monetary policy, the Budget itself.
Is your own reputation also bound up with the success or otherwise of this
Budget?
'No. Reputations cannot be made and lost in terms of single events in this
world. What matters is how you perform over a period of time.'
You will be 50 soon. Is there life after the Treasury - something else you
would like to do?
'I would hope at some stage that I would do something else. This is not
something I think about a great deal. I have the philosophy of doing the job
that I currently have as well as I can, and leaving the future to look after
itself. So far, the future has looked after itself.'
It was the man speaking, of course, not the permanent secretary to the
Treasury.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The reason I'm a good news guy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the good news/bad news debate, I stand with the good guys - those who
believe that newspapers and television emphasise and exaggerate bad news at
the expense of the good. One of the reasons I am a good news guy is that the
bad news guys - those who thrive on bleakness and sensation and maintain,
often comically, that 'news', by definition, is almost always 'bad' -
persistently queer my pitch.
I am no sort of optimist. I am a hard-line, short-term pessimist. But even I
can see there is plenty of good news about and believe it should be reported
adequately in the interests of balance.
It is a theory of mine that one of the reasons for the emphasis on bad news
is that it is cheaper to collect and present. Bad news is a commodity. It
floods in from agencies. A decent famine or crash generates a tide of words
and pictures which can be shovelled into a page or bulletin at almost the
speed of light. Good news, conversely, often has to be mined from a deep and
expensive seam. (People who work on news desks will dub this opinion 'crap.'
They can just join the queue).
Some days ago, The Times carried three useful letters on good news/bad news.
One correspondent claimed that 'good news is essential to foster a spirit of
optimism and belief that the human race is capable of living in peace and
love one with another.' No news desk would accept that part of its job was
to propagandise feel-good stories in the style of Big Brother, and the
objection would not be pernickety.
But a second correspondent, Charles Clayton, executive director of World
Vision UK, whatever that may be, scored impressively: 'Last August. British
newspapers could have run the momentous headline: 'Famine defeated in
southern Africa' following the UN's declaration that the threatened
drought-related famine, of which we had heard so much, finally had been
averted. That story, although positive, ranked as newsworthy by any
standards.'
Two other examples Clayton quoted were: 'Cambodian elections miraculously
peaceful' and 'Life and hope return to Somali villages.' He said that all
three stories were newsworthy in their own right, and concluded: 'Accuracy
and balance in individual articles and stories is laudable. But an accurate
overall balance - of good and bad news, of positive and negative
developments over time - is equally important.'
It is essential not to confuse good news with banal. Last April I made a
meal, on the travel page, of a hideously irksome flight from London to Bali
I had suffered at the hands of Garuda, Indonesia's state airline. The
door-to-door travelling time was 28 hours. On and on I whinged.
In the months since then, I have flown hither and thither without a single
hitch. Should I have reported this, in the interests of balance? Absolutely
not. It is the job of airlines to fly people quickly and carefully from one
point to another. That is what they are for, how they make their money.
The point about the Garuda flight was that thousands of holidaymakers almost
certainly did not know that their flight to Bali would stop en route in
Paris, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Jakarta, causing distress and jet-smack and
gouging into their holidays. (Garuda reacted stoically: I received a classy
letter from one of the high-ups, wishing me pleasant travels the next time I
flew with them).
Some media use ombudsmen to help guard readers' and viewers' interests. In
future, I expect to see the appointment of good-news editors to help
maintain balance.
Suppose that the news editor tells the morning conference that an asteroid
is heading for Manchester. Devastation is assured. He is pulling out the
stops - ordering page after page of special coverage. He turns to the
good-news editor: 'Anything, Rodney?' (Good-news editors are bound to be
called Rodney.
'Absolutely, Mark. An asteroid that wipes out Manchester suggests various
important angles from the good-news perspective. First, once it is rebuilt,
Manchester will be able to launch a viable bid for the Olympic games. There
will be no more sniggering.
'Second, the obliteration of Manchester is bound to cause a steep fall in
the national crime figures. And so on and so forth. Take my word, Mark: the
Manchester asteroid is a good-news asteroid from where I'm sitting.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Louvre spreads its wings - The power and politics
behind the new Richelieu wing, one of President Mitterrand's Grand Projets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Winter descended on Paris this week. An icy chill fell over the city. Snow
fell only to melt into ugly slush. Yet day after day hundreds of people
queued patiently, and not so patiently, in the freezing courtyard of the
Louvre Museum to see the sumptuous new Richelieu wing.
The new wing is the old home of the French finance ministry that has been
reclaimed by the Louvre, or the Grand Louvre, as it is now called, to house
some of its finest collections: from the splendid salons of Napoleon III and
the 7th century BC Assyrian Palace of King Sargon II to the exquisite
paintings by Rubens that depict the life of the Marie de Medicis.
The Louvre collections have long been regarded as the richest in the world,
thanks to the relish with which the 1789 revolutionaries ransacked the
French royal family's possessions and the efficiency with which Napoleon I's
soldiers executed his order to plunder everything that glistened on their
military expeditions. The opening of the Richelieu wing finally furnishes
the museum's treasures with a fitting home.
But the triumph of the opening masks a bitter political battle between
President Francois Mitterrand, who commissioned the Grand Louvre
construction scheme as part of the Grands Projets that he initiated under
the 1980s socialist governments, and the current conservative government,
which favours a very different approach to architecture.
The conservatives were out in force for the opening ceremony. Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, was there; as was Jacques Chirac, the wily
mayor of Paris who is still (barring a last minute challenge by Balladur)
the right's likeliest presidential contender, accompanied by his old ally,
the current arts minister, Jacques Toubon. But their forced smiles did
nothing to disguise the fact that the stars of the ceremony were President
Mitterrand and the former socialist arts minister, Jack Lang.
The Grands Projets are Francois Mitterrand's most visible legacy to France.
The Grand Louvre scheme, conceived by IM Pei, the Chinese-American
architect, is the biggest and boldest of all the projets. By the time it is
completed in 1997 the work on the Louvre will have taken ten years and cost
Dollars 1bn.
The Richelieu wing has enabled the museum to add 21,500 square metres of
extra exhibition space and to show 12,000 works, a quarter of which were
previously in storage including the Renaissance tapestries (too big to be
squeezed into the old galleries) and an Islamic collection that has not been
seen by the public for 50 years. By comparison, the National Gallery in
London crams 2,200 works into 10,334 square metres.
The style of the new Louvre bears the unmistakable stamp of Francois
Mitterrand. The leitmotif of his architectural policy has been the marriage
of the monumental and the modern that Pei evoked in the first phase of the
Grand Louvre scheme: the uncompromisingly contemporary glass pyramid that he
plonked in the centre of the grand, old Cour Carrousel.
Pei has adopted the same strategy of blending the old with the new in the
Richelieu wing, but the effect is far subtler. At the centre of the new wing
are three magnificent courtyards with glazed roofs. The Cour Marly and Cour
Puget contain the sculpture that once graced the royal gardens. The Cour
Khorsabad is dominated by a pair of gigantic winged bulls from ancient
Assyria. Any contemporary features, such as the giant circle that Pei has
carved out of the Cour Puget wall, are so elegant and economical that they
blend perfectly with the original interior.
So far the Richelieu wing has been a roaring success. The number of weekly
visitors to the Louvre has doubled to 230,000 since the opening.
The new galleries not only cement the Louvre's reputation as the doyenne of
the world's great museums, but strengthens Paris's claim to be the cultural
capital of Europe.
This is, of course, exactly what President Mitterrand intended when he
initiated the Grands Projets. But it also poses a dilemma for the Balladur
government given that such a prominent part of French cultural policy is
indelibly linked to the socialist president.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Tracey still tops - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A month away form his 67th birthday, pianist Stan Tracey is celebrating an
eventful half century in music which began with the Ted Heath Orchestra and
has only recently been rewarded with a 'major' recording contract (with the
Blue Note label).
Not that the pianist's teetering piano style and expansive big band writing
has ever been hidden from view. Self-produced recordings (some recently
re-released) which quickly became collectors' items, 21 commissioned suites
commissioned for big occasions and a long stint as house pianist at Ronnie
Scott's, followed by much touring, have all combined to keep Tracey at the
top in British jazz - and always in the best possible company.
The golden jubilee celebration held at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Tuesday
featured, as a result, some of the country's best lived-in sounds (Alan
Skidmore and Don Weller) as well as the freshest young talent (Guy Barder
and Gerard Presencer) in exuberant duo, quartet, sextet, octet and flying
big band formations.
Kicking off the retrospective in a quartet alongside longtime partner Art
Themen, bassist Dave Green and son Clark Tracey on drums, the leader ambled
appropriately into Monk's 'I Mean You'. The pecking keyboard technique and
crazy arpeggios owe much to Monk and the duo with young trumpet star Gerard
Presencer on the late bebopper's 'Pannonica' which followed, was touching
enough to attract an early encore.
The Octet, which featured the sweet and sour tones of altoist Peter King and
the gruff tenor of Don Weller, showed off Tracey's relaxed but purposeful
accompaniment in samba-ish excerpts from the highly recommended Blue Note
record Portraits Plus (BCDP 7806962). A tender solo reading of Duke
Ellington's 'Sophisticated Lady', was greeted like an old friend and the 14
piece big band, swinging through the changes with sparks flying from the
horns, made strong the connection with Ellington.
There are not may jazz musicians who can write, lead and accompany with such
understated inspiration. Back in the 1960s, Sonny Rollins, now noted for his
use of slavish sidemen, was said to have been jolted by Tracey's angular
accompaniment. Glad to say the prodding and percussive Tracey sound remains
as idiosyncratically appealing as it is challenging 30 years on.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Emblematic encounters - An evening at the Riverside
theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two shows at the Riverside Studios demonstrate how catholic a venue this has
become. One is Heartstrings, a multi-lingual and multi-cultural workout, and
the other is How To Act Better, a slice of flim-flan served up with a VCR
and big screen.
Heartstrings misses the mark for the right reasons. It tries to be bold and
demanding, but strays too often into no-sense, worse than nonsense. It is
devised and acted by the fine European company, Talking Pictures. Five
actors run a series of emblematic encounters together to make an emotional
history: arrivals, departures, beginnings and endings are played in mime,
song and (at least) seven different languages, more if you count the various
dialects of Spanish and English.
The show relies on creating moments of insight which show rather than tell
what is happening. The best scenes emerge where least is said: a silent
tableau of incest, where the victim cries only 'Mama', or the hilarious
meeting of two sisters quasi-married to the same man, one speaking
Castillian, the other Argentinean Spanish. There is a poignant retirement
home scene and a good slapstick meeting between two lovers where one learns
the other's language with haphazard abandon.
The director, Sandra Mladenovitch has rightly realised that drama can levy
demands and entertain. She keeps the scenery to a minimum, using only
translucent black screens and a junk pile of props. The actors are
unremittingly energetic and versatile. The play has moments of great
intensity, but it still needs a strong unifying theme. The overall effect is
tousled rather than coiffured.
Later at the Riverside, hair is on the agenda for the American, Annie
Griffin, who talks three hopefuls through a course in How To Act Better.
This is a documentary about acting. At one point, the ubiquitous video
camera through which she addresses the audience follows her backstage for a
bit of dressing-room verite where she bemoans the fate of her tonsured
locks.
She starts the evening, her back to the audience, presenting her resume:
'Height 5.10' (negotiable) 'weight 126 pounds, good posture, fluent French,
perfect teeth.' She has blood red lipstick, black evening gloves, pearls
round her throat and the inevitable black velvet dress. For documentary read
vampumentary.
The idea of a tour round the theatre, beginning with Upstage Left and
visiting the corners of the stage ('Let's continue our journey downstage')
runs out of steam as Griffin runs out of the theatre, seducing the video
cameraman on screen. But for 60 minutes, the idea works as Griffin makes hay
in the dry ice and camps up imitations of Sara Bernhardt and scenes from La
Dame aux Camelias.
Griffin is precise, versatile and engaging. Her mannered delivery puts her
in Kathleen Turner territory; and the fake chaos and video link trespass on
the TV documentary province of fellow Americans Ruby Wax and Laurie Pike.
She has a trio of beefcake proteges hoping to act better (Will Brook, Eliot
Giuralarocca and Oliver Senton), but they neither need nor profit from her
advice. How to Act Better makes a relaxing reward after the rigours of
Heartstrings earlier in the evening.
Both shows at The Riverside Studios (081 748 3354) until December 11

FT  04 DEC 93 / Records: Fireside music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most delightful moment at this year's Gramophone record awards came when
Sir Georg Solti, presenting one of the prizes, admitted that he had never
heard the piece of music in question, although he added smartly that as it
had won, it must be good. The category was highest-selling classical disc of
the year. The winner was Gorecki's Third Symphony.
Only a couple of years ago Gorecki was a name that almost nobody in the West
knew. How far the vast popularity of his symphony is due to the simultaneous
arrival on the scene of Classic FM is no doubt a topic for discussion in the
marketing departments of every music organisation in the country. It seems
unlikely that it was wholly coincidence (excerpts from the symphony were
playing the very first time I tuned in to Classic FM).
At any rate, there are now large numbers of listeners out there who have
decided that they like this form of transcendentalism in music and Radio 3
is evidently keen to get its hands on them. The BBC Symphony Orchestra has
already given us some Kancheli; next January it turns its attention to
Tavener, the other composer to have scored a hit in this area. For its two
concerts in Radio 3's Celebration of Polish Arts and Culture it turned
inevitably to - yes, Gorecki.
The second of the pair, on Thursday, invited Alexander Lazarev, the
orchestra's Principal Guest Conductor, to perform the Third Symphony. (A
tame conductor is a necessity, as no other would surely be prepared to spend
time on the piece.) How disappointed the programme-planners must have been.
Half a million people have bought the CD, but only about 1,000 could be
lured to a half-empty Royal Festival Hall to hear it live.
It seems to me that Gorecki has produced a new phenomenon: a symphony for
the home consumer. Heard after a hard day at the office, the music is no
doubt ideal for relaxing, gently transporting the listener off to a higher
plane. Sound-bites work well, too; the couple of minutes I caught on Classic
FM were enough to make anybody want to hear more. But trying to keep
concentration going in the concert-hall for nearly an hour on nothing but
endlessly repeated common chords is another matter. No wonder Gorecki's
supporters stayed away.
To provide the Polish coupling, Gorecki's Third Symphony was preceded by
Szymanowski's Fourth, as much a piano concerto as a symphony really (Janina
Fialkowska was the bright soloist). The programme-note helpfully pointed to
the composers' shared interest in Polish folk melodies, but it is unlikely
the audience will have perceived much in common between them. Szymanowski is
as restless as Gorecki is static and the Fourth Symphony darts about
unconvincingly. The orchestra sounded unhappy with it.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Funny lines that lead nowhere - Karen Fricker reviews
Neil Simon's latest play to open on Broadway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laughter on the 23rd Floor marks Neil Simon's return to the safer ground of
autobiographical comedy after his recent attempts at the adult relationship
play (Jake's Women) and the musical (The Goodbye Girl). Laughter, which
opened this month (November) at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, picks up
Simon's life story where the final installment of his successful Brighton
Beach Memoirs trilogy left off.
Young Simon - here named Lucas and played by the fresh-faced Stephen Mailer
 -lands his first big writing job on a live television comedy programme
which bears a strong resemblance to Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, for
which Simon indeed wrote in the early 1950s.
This seems material ripe for the genre of writing at which Simon excels  -
tidy, nostalgic plays laced through with Jewish humour - and Simon has
certainly written a constant stream of funny lines in Laughter, which keep
the audience chuckling, often howling. He just has not constructed much of a
play to hold the jokes up. Laughter's comic pleasures turn out to be of the
fleeting kind: jokes fade from memory as soon as their launched, and the
plot is stretched so thin it is barely there.
The play takes place in a dingy conference room in a Manhattan office
building in 1953. The characters, many based on the real-life comedy titans
on Caesar's writing team - Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart - come off
as a bag of overblown, but funny, stereotypes: the high-strung Russian head
writer; the laconic, chain-smoking Irish-American; the token woman; and the
perennially late, arrogant Jewish hypochondriac, among others.
Towering over them all in character, but dwarfed by many in actual stature,
is the Caesar doppelganger, Max Prince, whom Nathan Lane brings to
marvellously overblown life. Some of the play's richest humour is mined from
the matter-of-fact exposition of Max's eccentricities: that he sends out his
suit to be cleaned during the working day and conducts business in
trenchcoat, shirtsleeves and boxer shorts is all the funnier because no one
on stage finds it remarkable.
The play is built on the humour of repetition rather than its more complex
and interesting cousin, the humour of accrual. In the first act, the
characters straggle in to work, exchange a few-one liners, grab a bagel and
coffee, and bicker, bicker, bicker . . . and in the second act they do
exactly the same thing. There are a few wisps of a story, mostly based
around the programme's dodgy relationship to the network, and substantial
issues hinted at - particularly the parallels this very Jewish writing staff
draws between McCarthyism and the Holocaust - but all end up providing
flavour rather than any backbone to the play.
So what is the point of all this? We are given our answer, thumpingly,
midway through the second act when the programme is under threat and one
character tells Max: 'we don't quit because maybe we'll never have this much
fun in our lives.' So now we know that this is a 'best years of our lives'
play; but we should have known that much sooner. Laughter traffics in
nostalgia, relying on the audience's knowledge of and fondness for the
subject matter rather than on effective plotting or characterisation.
This not particularly well-done play is given a top-notch production.
Director Jerry Zaks (Guys and Dolls, Six Degrees of Separation) keeps the
pace at just the right pitch of controlled hysteria. Standing out among the
performers, along with Lane, are JK Simmons as the bloodhound-faced
Irishman, Brian, and Ron Orbach as the loathsome hypochondriac, Ira. Tony
Walton's set is appropriately grotty - smudged windows, vinyl sofas, and
all; Tharon Musser's lighting casts a fluorescent glow that is just sickly
enough; and William Ivey Long's costumes capture both the period and the
essence of each character, from Brian's tacky poly-blend suits to Prince's
exaggerated pinstripes.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Books: Travels with Fane, Wharton and Woolf - Books which
would make good presents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the autumn when Bookermania is at fever-pitch some novels written on
traditional lines tend to get passed over simply because they appear to be
non-starters for the prize. Julian Fane's Eleanor (Constable, Pounds 14.99,
246 pages) which appeared in September is an example. It is the story of a
girl born the wrong side of the blanket in 1906 to a woman in society who
confines her to a foster home in South London. The two 'Auntys' who run it
serve as working-class substitutes for the real mother whose visits to her
natural daughter are as infrequent as they are fraught with tension and
incomprehension. Her foster-mothers may tend to spoil Eleanor, but they also
encourage her to develop her gift for piano-playing. This talent, combined
with her striking beauty, gives her the entry into London society where she
acquires a following of rich, doting admirers.
Fane's novels have won plaudits from the likes of Lord David Cecil, Harold
Nicolson, John Betjeman. In private life he is the Hon. Julian Fane, son of
the 14th Earl of Westmorland and Hugo Vickers has identified Eleanor as
being a portrait taken from life with the late Joan Drogheda contributing to
the inspiration behind it, with Violet and Sidney Schiff (the writer Stephen
Hudson) as among others drawn from life. Be that as it may - as one of
Eleanor's counsellors might put it - this is a novel that imposes its own
imaginative world upon the reader. It shuttles between the under- and the
over- privileged, the sexually naive and the predatory. It contrasts the
dedication required to succeed as an artist and the evanescent fame of the
fashionable drawing-room. If you are looking for something to give a
mother-in-law who is an incurable novel-addict, your problem may well be
solved by Fane's book.
It would, surely, have appealed to that chronicler of the American upper
ten, Edith Wharton. Thanks to a film, due to be released over here in
January, of her novel The Age of Innocence directed by Martin Scorsese with
Daniel Day-Lewis, several of Wharton's novels of old New York society are
currently being reissued in paperback. The final novel, left unfinished at
her death, The Buccaneers, has just been published in a version completed by
the American Whartonian, Marion Mainwaring (Fourth Estate (Pounds 14.99, 408
pages). Its heroines are denied entry into exclusive New York society
because their fathers' money is too new. They come to London where they find
plenty of well-born hostesses and suitors prepared to waive that impediment
and welcome them in. The book is an example of high comic art.
Another book that is having a renaissance because of the 'crossover' from an
art-movie is Virginia Woolf's Orlando, a private joke that has blossomed
into a money-spinner. The latest edition is in the attractive pocketable
Bloomsbury Classics series, appropriately enough, at Pounds 9.95. In Orlando
Virginia Woolf ranged across the centuries while in her own life we think of
her as belonging to a world circumscribed by central London and Sussex.
Jan Morris's ingenious contribution to the Woolf saga Travels with Virginia
Woolf (The Hogarth Press Pounds 17.99, 245 pages) is a corrective to that
view of her environment. Woolf went three times to Venice, for instance, one
of them in 1912 on her honeymoon. 'There never was such an amusing and
beautiful place', she said. Morris has strung together her reactions to
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and Greece along with
her journeys throughout the British Isles.
When she was in France she stayed with Vanessa and Clive Bell at Cassis.
'Ever since Cassis' she tells Vanessa 'I have thought of you as a bowl of
golden water which brims but never overflows'. But how did Vanessa think of
sister Virginia? With the publication of Selected Letters of Vanessa Bell
(Bloomsbury Pounds 25.00, 593 pages) edited by Regina Marler we can find the
answer to that question and other outstanding ones. Here is a judicious
selection of 600 letters out of 3,000; and none of them has appeared in
print before.
The last member of that circle to survive today is Frances Partridge, who in
her nineties is enjoying great success with the publication of her diaries
chronicling the fortunes of remnant members of the group in the 1960s. The
period was a shattering one for her as it saw the deaths of both her husband
Ralph and their son Burgo who had married Henrietta, daughter of David and
Angelica Garnett.
An earlier volume, Hanging On, covered the beginning of the decade; the new
one Other People (Harper Collins Pounds 18, 297 pages) continues with the
years 1963-66 when the author found the best antidote to grief was to
involve herself whole-heartedly in the lives of her friends. As a diarist
she is not in the Woolf class, but the book chronicles a most civilised way
of life with penetrating comments on the personalities of her wide circle of
friends.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Books: General Gordon - a very rum cove - The imperial
progress of this evangelical soldier hero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GORDON: THE MAN BEHIND THE LEGEND
by John Pollock Constable Pounds 19.95, 373 pages
General Gordon was one of our great imperial heroes but he was also a very
rum cove - come to think of it, like so many of them. He was 'inspired and
mad', said Gladstone; the procrastination of Gladstone's government was of
course responsible for Gordon's death in Khartoum in 1885, two days before
the relief party arrived up the Nile.
It can be agreed that Gordon was 'very eccentric to the point of making one
doubt his absolute sanity', according to another, more sympathetic
acquaintance: he reviewed his troops in a frock coat; he fined officers a
shilling if they called him 'Sir'; at Khartoum he sat every night in a
brightly-lit window in defiance of the Mahdi's snipers; he led his men into
battle carrying only a cane and a cheroot (but surely that was not so
unusual? - Cardigan is supposed to have headed the charge of the Light
Brigade holding a cigar, and it has been argued that the unarmed British
officers who took their companies 'over the top' were somehow disassociating
themselves from the vulgar business of slaughter).
No, the central eccentricity in Gordon's life was that he was an extreme
specimen of an evangelical Christian whose faith, acquired at 21, gave him a
disregard for death and a total reliance on divine destiny; sometimes it
appears in his letters a deathwish. His friend Field-Marshal Lord Wolseley
later wrote, 'Life was to him but a Pilgrim's Progress between the years of
early manhood and the Heaven he now dwells in, the Home he always longed
for'. In the meantime, Gordon was not just a brave and efficient man of war,
he was also close to being a soldier of fortune - the word 'mercenary' is
wrong because he was not remotely interested in money and he was always
under the War Office - who successively commanded in battle Chinese,
Egyptian and African, but never British, troops, and yet he became a British
military hero. It is a good illustration of the workings of the Pax
Britannica.
There have recently been a number of intelligent books about the Empire
which focus in particular on the sexual ambiguity of these imperial
servants. Gordon always figures prominently. Ronald Hyam, for instance, in
Empire and Sexuality, has a list of what he calls 'a-sexual' high-achievers
including Gordon, Kitchener, Jowett, Twining, Rhodes, Milner, Baden-Powell,
Lugard, Curzon, Churchill, Montgomery, Macmillan, etc. Evidently these men
were not all suppressed homosexuals, but the implication is that they were
formed so as to be able to devote their principal energies to their public
role. Some of them must have been suppressing something. Gordon's particular
affection, which he never concealed, was for young boys, whose welfare and
moral development were his deepest concern throughout his life.
John Pollock, in this new biography Gordon: the Man behind the Legend, does
not belong to this generation tempted by psychoanalytic theory, and is more
concerned to put down the recurrent story that Gordon was a secret drinker.
There have been plenty of biographies of Gordon over the years, many of them
hagiographical (the recent ones by ex-politician Anthony Nutting and Charles
Chevenix-Trench are not) and Pollock's justification for yet another is that
he has been able to draw heavily on the millions of words in Gordon's family
letters in order to rescue 'the real Gordon'.
It was Lytton Strachey, in his wonderfully mischievous Eminent Victorians in
1918, who first raised the scandalous suggestion that the general, apart
from lashing out in un-Christian temper at his servants, would sometimes
seal himself in his tent with 'an open Bible and an open bottle of brandy'.
Pollock convincingly argues against the liquor at the price of conceding
that Gordon was a dangerous smoker ('. . . smoking knocked off, never, DV,
to be resumed, as yet it has not been my greatest trial. I can say that, as
far as the flesh, I do not care for anything . . .') He never managed to
give it up.
This is a respectful, cautious biography, untouched by Strachey's elegant
intelligence, but there is a good tale to tell, deliberately uncluttered by
too much analysis or interpretation. Gordon was a Sapper who, after the
Crimea, found himself in China in 1861 putting down the pseudo-Christian
Taiping rebellion as commander of the foreign-officered 'Ever Victorious
Army'. The legend of'Chinese' Gordon was quickly established. Then came
years of fortification construction and devout social work in Gravesend -
'Something broke in my heart, a palpable feeling and I knew God lived in me'
 -and, in 1874, the Governor-Generalship of Equatoria Province and then of
the Sudan itself, absolute monarch of a country the size of Western Europe,
answerable only to the Khedive in Cairo. He was 44.
Then Abyssinia (a set-back), a mistaken appointment to India, China again, a
sabbatical in Ireland, and Mauritius and the Seychelles where the
Bible-reading soldier discovered the Coco de mer and decided he had come to
the Garden of Eden. The celibate Gordon's obsession with a nut shaped
unmistakeably like a vulva is, to say the least, curious. After Basutoland
(another mistake) and the Holy Land he almost went to work for King Leopold
in the Congo, but at the last moment was diverted by Gladstone's reluctant
government to Khartoum where his mission, hopelessly under-formulated by
Cabinet, was to secure the retreat of Egyptian rule in favour of Sudanese
independence. In essence, Gordon was expected to produce an impossible
miracle.
The rest of the story is familiar, though we shall never know the true
detail of Gordon's death exactly a year after he arrived in the palace
overloooking the Nile. Curiously, Pollock is at his weakest in this his most
dramatic episode (compare him with Thomas Pakenham's splendid The Scramble
for Africa). We could also have done with a posthumous chapter explaining
what happened next - but the slightness of historical context is the main
weakness of this readable study which is strongest in the attention it pays
to Gordon's religion, his theology described by the expert Pollock as 'an
unintegrated mixture brewed from early Christian fathers, Gnostics, medieval
and 17th century mystics, Evangelicals and Tractarians' In view of all the
other books, perhaps the priority is right.
One footnote: on the final voyage to Khartoum, Gordon annotated a copy of
Newman's The Dream of Gerontius; that volume was sent to England and
eventually re-published complete with the general's pencil markings; Edward
Elgar was given a copy: and that inspired the Oratorio]

THE WILLOWS IN WINTER by William Horwood HarperCollins Pounds 12.99, 296
pages
PEMBERLEY by Emma Tennant Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 9.99, 184 pages
Did Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy live happily ever after? Did Toad of Toad
Hall really reform? Of course you want to know. Characters from great and
much loved novels remain so vividly in our imagination that we long for them
to have a future beyond the last page, outside the artistic construct in
which they were created. Hence the craze for the sequel - first Scarlett,
after Gone With The Wind, then Mrs de Winter, after Rebecca, and now
follow-ups to The Wind in the Willows and Pride and Prejudice. To
publishers, it is gold dust - Pemberley, published this month, has already
been reprinted.
The hitch this time is that the better the original book, the less likely it
is that a sequel will convince. Pride and Prejudice and The Wind in the
Willows are harder acts to follow than Rebecca. They do not, as Rebecca
does, leave loose ends and ambiguity as a helpful push for sequel writers.
They have a tight form and an artistic cohesion which is not easily intruded
upon. Their pleasures are rooted in fine and distinctive language, which it
is impossible to imitate. Emma Tennant fails to understand this, and her
pastiche of Jane Austen's style, form and wit in Pemberley is a disaster.
William Horwood does see it, and The Willows in Winter is less ambitious. A
light-hearted updating of Kenneth Grahame's Edwardian classic, it is a
funny, clever book shot through with the delight of recognition.
Horwood's skill is to close the gap between us and Grahame without losing
the playful Arcadian vision which suffuses The Wind in the Willows. He is
slavishly respectful to the river setting and to the animal quartet - loyal
Mole, dreamy Rat, wise Badger, bad Toad - but he invents a run of adventures
more pacy and dangerous than any Grahame would have dreamt up.
Toad graduates from motor cars to aeroplanes, predictably favouring the
crash landing, which is the centrepiece of the book. Rat still dreams of the
wide world beyond, but he does so while slapping about in a parachute. Mole
dives underground, this time through the ice on a bad river outing. Horwood
attributes gravitas and grey whiskers to the animals, and sets them against
a new generation - Mole's Nephew, and the baby otter Portly, now a louche
teenager. But they have become not Edwardian gentlemen but reckless 1990s
adolescents.
Grahame's 1908 novel is a mix of slapdash grotesque, in Toad's story, and
spiritual longings - the ache for childhood and home; nostalgia for the
changing countryside. The idea of home survives here, in the plot of animals
lost and found; otherwise Horwood concentrates on comedy. He neatly reverses
some famous images - Toad is disguised as a chimney sweep instead of a
washerwoman - and introduces a bold colloquial idiom ('Toad's probably
gassing away', 'Rat had put two and two together').
Never for a moment does this book resemble Grahame's masterpiece, the
pastoral dream, the sense of hope and loss, the emblematic characters. 'The
child who has once met Mr Badger has got ever afterwards, in its bones, a
knowledge of humanity and English history,' wrote CS Lewis. Horwood does not
try to equal this; he merely capitalises on it. Self-publicity seems to
drive him - a final page invites inquiries about him to 'Department
Willows', c/o his publishers - but his book is affable and entertaining.
Pemberley on the other hand is an attempt at copycat creativity: Ms Tennant
writes her own novel using Austen's characters. The Darcys and the Bennetts,
now intermarried, gather for a first Christmas at Pemberley, and fall out
spectacularly. Jane Bingley goes into premature labour, her sister Elizabeth
cannot conceive. An illegitimate child in the village may be Darcy's, but he
is too proud and Elizabeth's too prejudiced to discuss it. Jane nearly dies,
Lizzy runs away and decides to become a governess. Janeite serenity is
restored, several banquets and many stilted 18th-century conversations
later: 'Do we go into your bedchamber, or do we go to separate quarters? The
decision is yours, my dear Elizabeth' . . .
This is Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy transported to Georgette Heyer-style
historical romance. It is thin, shallow, lifeless. Austen's sparky Elizabeth
withers into a disappointed Georgian wife. Darcy is stiff, icy and
preposterous as a snowman.
The wintry setting and Christmas ambience suggests that Pemberley, like The
Willows in Winter, was published with an eye to the festive market. There is
an excellent tradition of one writer transforming elements of another's work
into something new and exciting - as in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are
Dead, Lady Macbeth of Mtensk, Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea, which tells the
story of Jane Eyre from the mad wife angle. It does not include rewriting
the classic as seasonal slush.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Books: War with the Cazalets - Fiction

<TEXT>
CONFUSION by Elizabeth Jane Howard
Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 416 pages
Confusion is the third volume of a planned quartet of novels chronicling the
lives of an upper-middle class English family in the decade after 1937,
covering, in fact, the last days of such an idyllically privileged caste.
Anyone unfamiliar with plucky Polly Cazalet; her unawakened but newly wed
cousin Louise; her Sapphic angel of an aunt Rachel; and all the peripheral
Nevilles, Angelas, and Wills who make up the cosily networked family, plus
the assorted retainers, would find it hard, and probably unrewarding, to
catch up with the clan at this late stage. For the hundreds of thousands who
have made the saga such a great publishing event no criticism would deter
their appetite for more.
The Cazalets are not having an exciting War. It is Elizabeth Jane Howard's
great achievement to stress the mundane, petty, tribulations of the early
1940s with meticulous accuracy. Much space is given over to food - meals of
corned beef hash and sausage meat rissole; to shopping expeditions for bust
bodices at long lost department stores like Pontings and Gaylor and Pope; to
tedious train journeys. There are impressively few deaths - matched by
births and re-births.
It is the limitations of war time, plus the natural restraints on young
girls of this class (no university for them), which makes Confusion a more
pedestrian read than its predecessors. It is still excellent historical
literature but Polly and cousin Cary, obviously Ms Howard's favourite
Cazalets, seem stuck in an intellectual and social gridlock.
There are signs that the writer is happier with children and emerging
teenagers - the verbally direct young Neville is the star turn here - rather
than with maturing adolescents. Polly and Cary's arrival in London is as
dull for us as it is for them, although Ms Howard gives them an agreeably
mysterious male protector in the middle aged Archie Lestrange: what are his
intentions? does he have any?
This is probably what the War was like for most people - a time of waiting,
of tedium, of coping. It is the vignettes that come across most powerfully.
Villy Cazalet makes the painful discovery at a misjudged dinner that men
want more than romance, while sister-in-law Zoe, returning from a desperate
visit to her mother, reveals a ready acceptance of the fact. She is picked
up on the train by an American officer, and it is American officers who
credibly provide most of the glamour and excitement in the novel.
I look forward to the conclusion of the chronicle even though I am as bored
with some of the characters, especially the spoilt Angela and the long
suffering Hugh, as I expect Ms Howard to be. Sometimes she seems to be
writing on auto cue: the most minor character suddenly dies; the love lives
of the two heroines are given a predictably mechanical twist.
It is as painless as over-hearing a long gossip about vague acquaintances,
pleasantly detached from reality and hardly disturbing. But the book ends as
the war ends and the action steps up apace. Passions are stirred; boats come
in. When the Cazalet Chronicle reaches the television screen, its inevitable
transformation, Confusion will hardly merit an episode as we approach the
long anticipated resolution.

<TEXT>
LIONS OF GRUNEWALD by Aidan Higgins Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 8.99, 302 pages
TELLING THE PICTURES by Frank Delaney HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 414 pages
These two novels seem to have nothing in common but the Irishness of their
authors. Higgins writes in dense prose, 'poetic' in the sense that its
meaning lies in the drama of the words. Daring to a point that sometimes
only just stops short of nonsense, he spins places, characters, events,
further and further out of our grasp and then, like the master craftsman he
is, whisks them back in front of us again. Delaney uses words to tell a
well-worked story, the life arising from the people he has created, not in
the describing of them. Higgins words will not lie still on the page, they
dazzle and confound. Delaney writes in a near documentary style; his words
know they are tools.
Yet there is an unforced link between the novels. Delaney has chosen as
heroine a young woman living in Belfast during the second world war who has
a particular gift with words. It is Belle who 'tells the pictures',
entertaining her mill worker colleagues as she acts out the latest film
showing at the Ritz. Belle is famous for this and this fame defines her
whole character so that real life hardly impinges on her. For her, the film
world is her chosen world and she preserves an innocence and beauty at odds
with the raw society in which she has grown up. It takes the kiss of a
handsome prince to wake her from her dream. But, since he is a Catholic,
from the Republic and she is a Protestant whose father was killed by the
IRA, her awakening brings tragedy rather than happiness.
Now Delaney is revealed to have a serious purpose, to be intent on revealing
corruption in high places, showing the cruelty of sectarian loyalties, the
bitter unfairness of Ulsterman towards Catholic. It is a black picture,
turning a book that seems set to be a romance into a thriller. Delaney may
not impress with stylistic fireworks, but he certainly knows how to use
bleak material to shocking and (perhaps shocking to say) entertaining
effect.
Separating content and style is not a very productive exercise with Higgins.
His story is slight. Professor Weaver, his wife Nancy and son, Nico, are
living in Berlin, kindly paid for, although not enough for the Weaver's
excesses, by DILDO, a mysterious organisation. Weaver is captivated by Lore,
a gloriously exciting young German girl. Nancy finds out and abandons home
in an attempt to bring her errant husband to his senses. But Weaver cannot
decide between his women. On a visit to Ireland, he goes to a fortune teller
who tells him he loves neither woman and, since he is not very good at
loving, it is just as well he does love his son. Weaver returns to Munich
and Lore.
Around this tale of love and betrayal, Higgins weaves a cast of
extraordinary characters who dance puppet-like through the pages, although
their habits tend to be very flesh and blood. Higgins often gets a laugh out
of the physical: 'Bog was staring raptly rudely at the slowly descending
stiffly corseted determined no-longer-young rump that was slowly heavily
yearningly descending . . .' Starting from a well-observed image, he rockets
into the stratosphere, leaving trails of hilarity. Less amusing are little
Nico's onomatopoeic stories or the pages when a heavy Irish mist seems to
shroud any meaning. If you do not appreciate a chapter that opens as
follows, then Higgins is not for you: ''Everything is something trembling on
the verge of something else,' quoth Vlad the Impaler, lepidopterist
extraordinaire, with his customary pernickety prescience and acumen.
Illusion, froggy transilience, as the very stuff of happiness.' I enjoyed
Lions of the Grunewald - in breath-holding gulps with sorties out of it for
air.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: A black day for the arts - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Heritage Minister, Peter Brooke, with his ingrained gentility, managed
to keep his temper when quizzed about his department's Budget allocation
this week. He could, with some justification, claim a small victory. His
expenditure next year will be Pounds 21m higher than in 1993-94, at Pounds
955m. OK, so Pounds 7m of that is statistical jiggery-pokery provoked by
that insatiable cuckoo in his nest, the British Library, now due to open in
1996, but even so he fared better than many forecasts.
Unfortunately the big loser, in fact the only obvious casualty, was the Arts
Council, provider to the vociferous performing arts lobby. Despite the fact
that the Council did better than anticipated - a 1.7 per cent reduction in
grant instead of the 2 per cent pencilled in a year ago, all hell let loose.
Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Council, declared it 'a black day for the arts
and a national disgrace'. Richard Eyre, director of the Royal National
Theatre, called the cut 'pointless and mean spirited.' And these were some
of the more positive reactions.
It does seem odd that the Arts Council, notwithstanding the generous grants
it received in the early 1990s, should be singled out for misery. For the
Minister must know the broader background. The bad news for the arts in the
Budget was not in his grant but the fact that local authorities, an equally
important revenue source, are suffering Pounds 750m cutbacks in government
aid, and that the middle classes were being financially walloped with tax
increases. Already in 1993 box office takings have started to fall
dramatically; 1994 could be a very bad year indeed for the arts.
As a microcosm of the crisis facing arts companies you might look at
Manchester. In 1994 it is City of Drama, but one theatre, the Forum, is
already dark, and another, the Library, has been warned that Manchester City
Council is likely to withdraw funding, not because of doubts about its
quality but because it is a choice of saving a theatre or an old folk's
home.
Even Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, one of the main initiators of new
plays in the UK, is contemplating a season of commercially safe, small cast,
productions. It will persist with a new, ambitious production of The Count
of Monte Cristo, but around it there will be more pot boilers than the city
anticipated when it won the opportunity to be the national face of British
drama. The arts does protest too much, but really a couple of million more
for the Arts Council would help to cheer the nation up during what looks
like a rather depressing patch.
Can you imagine London without a permanent professional opera company? Well,
it could happen. Both the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and the English
National Opera at the Coliseum are planning to close for renovation. Both
expect to be open to welcome in the new Millennium, and unless there is
careful planning soon their closures could overlap.
Covent Garden, with its ambitious office and shop development, will be out
of action for around two years. So it needs to close in 1997. It still has
to raise Pounds 150m for the venture but has promises of around Pounds 50m
from its rich friends, Mrs Vivien Duffield, and Lords Sainsbury and
Rothschild. It hopes that Lottery money and the general public will provide
the remainder.
The ENO has been quieter about its plans but unless around Pounds 25m is
raised soon its early 20th century building could decline into squalor. It
is sounding out its supporters before launching its public appeal, probably
in 1995. It, too, would anticipate Lottery aid. It needs the money for such
unglamorous but essential improvements as better air conditioning and more
ladies' loos.
It is hoped that the two opera companies, and perhaps the Royal Ballet, will
temporarily move into the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, during the repairs.
Yesterday Mr Justice Hoffmann gave the Arts Council's music panel his
decision on the future public funding of three of London's symphony
orchestras. He is believed to have recommended that only one should be
supported. And there are rumours that he could have come down in favour of
the Philharmonia.
However, all is still to play for. The full Arts Council could decide at its
December meeting to support a package, assigning the LPO to a more
independently funded South Bank; making the Philharmonia the new super
orchestra; and bribing the RPO to become a Nottingham based orchestra
serving the East Midlands. This one will run and run and run.

The World Service is presenting a series, Free at Last, on the current state
there of colour-consciousness. It has a certain sentimental aura that is not
always helpful; but with racial prejudice breaking out here it must be good
to hear how it has been dealt with in its more extreme shape.
The first programme, last night, began with gospel singing and the voice of
Martin Luther King, but mostly took a historical tone. Emancipation in 1861
did not mean instant equality between citizens and former slaves. Colour
segregation persisted even beyond the second world war. A black girl in the
wrong bus seat might provoke an anti-black demonstration. All segregation
was outlawed in 1963 under Kennedy's Civil Rights Bill, and voting was taken
in hand the following year. But this was also the year of the Watts riots in
Los Angeles, and riots have continued sporadically to the present time.
The second programme (Friday) looks at the city of Philadelphia, an example
of peaceful segregation. The city is divided by the rail track; on one side
live the whites in relative prosperity, on the other, the blacks in
comparative poverty. Yet there are black and white children side by side at
school, and sports teams may be divided half-and-half with no trouble. A
local paper, with a black editor, is notably fair. The next programme shows
how the situation can deteriorate in adverse circumstances.
Radio 4 is running a serial on Wednesday afternoons, The Crack, four
Liverpudlian writers to four instalments. Lightweight tales, the interest
lies in the characters. In the first (Friday) barmy old Albert finds a
corpse lying on a gravestone, but After tea at a nunnery with Edith from the
old people's home, he cares more that Dawn, a tart, should be baptised; he
cares so much for baptism that he jumps into the river to simulate the
ceremony for himself, but Edith drags him out.
People, more than plot, connect instalments. Next week (Saturday,) Carol, a
hairdresser in her late thirties, wonders why Joe, a former priest, should
have been de-frocked. She also wants to tell her boyfriend she is pregnant,
but his phone is always on the answering-machine. She is specially anxious
because he has been seen with another girl. There is talk with Dawn about
the gravestone body. Mustn't tell you the end, though. I have heard the next
two, with modest excitement. Director Kate Rowland tells of 'the anarchy of
the ordinary', and that is what The Crack offers.
Not so ordinary was the Monday Play, Sweet William by Peter Thomson, about
discovering Shakespeare's original scripts; but the story was so anarchic
that the excitements lacked edge. William (Kim Wall), bastard son of Samuel
Ireland, a credulous Shakespeare-fan seeking new items for his collection,
is in his father's mould, but more inventive. On a Stratford visit, Samuel
buys some curious items very cheaply (the date is 1796) but is not offered
the papers from New Place, now at Compton House. William, however, secures
some from his friend Mr H, who also claims to have more, including a play,
King Arthur, in manuscript. William has been reading about Chatterton, the
boy poet-suicide, and when the missing papers are publicised, he claims to
have written them himself. Others are involved in the detections and
deceptions, but they are barely characters at all. Nigel Bryant directed.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: A taste of Givenchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tonight in the Metropole Palace Hotel, Monte Carlo Christie's is selling
furniture, silver and art works belonging to fashion designer Hubert de
Givenchy, one of France's great collectors.
Both to prepare for retirement in two years' time and cater for his aged
labrador which finds the stairs too much, the 66-year-old couturier recently
sold his town house and is now auctioning its contents, which are estimated
at FFr200m.
Even this fraction of Givenchy's possessions represents the sort of sale
seen once in a generation - 95 lots collected over a period of some 30 years
with exquisite taste from galleries and salerooms all over the world.
Everything was flown out to Christie's Park Avenue showroom in New York in
October and also exhibited in the sumptuous Mona Bismarck Foundation in
Paris - Charles Cator of Christie's said he had never seen so many big
collectors turn up at viewings.
Most of the items are supremely elegant, Louis XV pieces. They include a
pair of gilt-bronze, three light 'girandoles' estimated FFr3-5m -
candlesticks supported on dragons, their tails sculpted to writhe down the
sides of a fireplace - a pair of exceptional large porphyry vases (est.
FFr2.5-3m) and a Regence gilt-bronze mirror attributed to Charles Cressent
(est. FFr4-5m).
Well before it became so fashionable Givenchy collected furniture by the
Parisian cabinet-maker Andre-Charles Boulle, famous for his elaborate inlays
of brass and tortoiseshell. Tonight's sale includes a pair of Louis XIV
medalliers by Boulle estimated FFr6-800,000, similar to a pair owned by the
Bibliotheque Nationale.
,The last lot, the Hanover Chandelier, has a catalogue all to itself.
Designed by Yorkshire architect William Kent and one of five commissioned
from Hanover silversmith Balthasar Behrens in 1736-1737 by George II, it
once hung in Windsor Castle, weighs 52 kilos and is estimated at FFr18-22m.

<TEXT>
This was the week when London became, temporarily, the market place for the
most expensive pictures in the world, the week when Sotheby's and Christie's
offered high quality Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary art.
No one can pretend that the capital was awash with masterpieces. Few sellers
are prepared to willingly consign their paintings to the auction rooms while
the global recession still exercises some grip, and there are few desperate
buyers. But at least the sales did not destroy the precarious confidence
created by the previous major auctions in the summer in New York, when
slightly better pictures were on offer. Who knows, by next summer a really
important painting, or two, might be risked on the open market.
Charles Allsopp, who took the major Christie's sale on Monday night,
reckoned it the best he had handled in this sector since the halcyon days of
1989. 'There were often plenty of bidders in the room and the dealers were
back'.
The most important lot, a portrait by the mysterious French
post-Impressionist Henri Rousseau of the dealer Joseph Brummer sold for
Pounds 2.97m. Few works by Rousseau, known as Le Douanier because he spent
most of his life working as a customs officer before taking up art, arrive
on the market, and this was a rather serious subject, unlike his primitive
jungle scenes. It would not have sold in a depressed market.
In all the 54 lots raised Pounds 14.3m, and were 84 per cent sold by value.
Christie's had judged the market to perfection and the next most important
lots, works by Klee, Kandinsky, and Chagall, each sold for over Pounds
800,000, at the lower end of their estimates. However buyers are still
choosy and 15 lots were unsold.
Sotheby's fared slightly less well, bringing in Pounds 11.6m for 74 lots at
its big Tuesday night auction. However, auctioneer Melanie Clore drew
satisfaction from the fact that it was 78 per cent sold by value, as against
60 per cent at the comparable sale of 1992. A Renoir landscape made Pounds
881,500, at the bottom of its estimate, but the top picture, a Kandinsky,
failed to sell. Buyers were mainly private collectors, many of them fresh
faces, and, not surprisingly, they favoured accessible paintings.
Oddly enough there was more interest in the sales of contemporary art. What
has been an unpredictable and nervous market suddenly seems to have caught
alight - perhaps late 19th and early 20th century art seems old hat.
Sotheby's was very happy with its principal auction which brought in Pounds
3.8m, and was 87 per cent sold by value. A Gerhard Richter free abstract
blasted its estimate, selling for Pounds 397,500 while a double self
portrait by Francis Bacon was on target at Pounds 353,500. Christie's
matched this with Pounds 3.7m, 92 per cent sold, and Pounds 518,500 paid for
a planed down, brown, 1949 work by Dubuffet.
London needs to attract better works in this post-1870 sector if its
position as a plausible competitor to New York does not slip beyond recall.
The imminent imposition of VAT on imported antiques from outside the EC,
even at a minimal 2 per cent, will persuade many vendors to go for the glitz
of a Manhattan sale.
Meanwhile the picture dealers are concentrating on making sales by offering
modestly priced works and selling them more imaginatively. Last weekend the
17 galleries which cluster together in London's Cork Street remained open
all Saturday and Sunday. The event attracted a few thousand browsers and
some dealers recorded more business than in a normal month.
David Messum, at The Gallery, sold 15 paintings, five priced around Pounds
2,500; Waddington Galleries disposed of six works, mostly on paper, and
ranging in price from Pounds 500 to Pounds 70,000 (for a Matisse, sold to a
foreign dealer) and including art by Michael Craig-Martin and William
Turnbull; Browse &amp; Darby despatched five paintings, including a still life
by Leonard McComb to a buyer new to the gallery; and the Redfern notched up
13 sales, of which three were landscapes by Sarah Armstrong Jones.

Christmas approaches, season of jollity and good will, and the only video
anyone is talking about is Childs Play 3. Did one of James Bulger's killers
watch it in the days before the murder and might it have spurred him on? The
boy's parents, police interviewers and lawyers all said they believed not.
But that has not stopped the trial judge from rounding up the usual
scapegoat and issuing another public warning about so-called Violent Videos.
Old habits die hard and it is no disincentive to our nation's wig-wearers
that we live in a country whose repressive screen legislation is already a
source of amazement, sometimes derision, to neighbour countries. As they
note on the continent, football hooligans and violent crime statistics like
Britain's are a grand advertisement for the success of a censorship-prone
society.
Childs Play 3 is a foolish little shocker with two chance similarities to
the Bulger case: paint thrown in victim's face, journey to murder spot. Draw
a line at screen fare like this and little short of Home Alone 2 would
escape censure.
Yet the madness of the More Censorship lobby marches on, and attempts to
make them pause by raising questionable precedents have little impact on
their zeal. Twenty-five years ago Mary Bell, the 11-year-old killer of two
small boys, said she was inspired to her murder by watching TV's The Saint.
Should we have banned that? And 12 years ago a US President might have
avoided an assassination attempt if the films of Jodie Foster had not
inspired his assailant. Should we ban Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone? (Long
before the moving image, of course, brutal murders were committed without
any help from the screen. See Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden and company).
Imitation is the mechanism most censorship lobbyists ring alarm bells about.
But imitation has little or nothing to do with most filmgoer's response to
TV, videos or films. Take four varied movies about violence issued on
cassette this month. Henri-Georges Clouzot's classic French shocker Les
Diaboliques (Simitar) has a tale more gory than Childs Play 3. A brutal
headmaster is graphically killed by two women - wife Vera Clouzot and
schoolmistress Simone Signoret - after which he returns, or seems to return,
to terrorise them.
What should we do with this film? It is searingly convincing dramatically;
it will purvey emotion, catharsis and even psychological insights to 99.9
per cent of viewers; and yet it might be 'imitated' by the other 0.1 per
cent. So might more recent, populist fare like Falling Down (Warners) and
the notorious Belgian film Man Bites Dog (Tartan). In the first, disgruntled
yuppie Michael Douglas takes the law into his hands and goes on a citywide
violence spree. In the second a serial murderer shows off his killing
prowess to two camcorder-wielding friends.
Same problem. Emotion, illumination, thought-provocation for 999 viewers;
blueprint for action for our lone Citizen Psychotic. If we intervened in
screen culture, given these odds and unpredictable indicators, where would
we stop? Why would we not harry into oblivion other films immortalised on
videotape this month? Bergman's The Seventh Seal (Tartan): mediaeval
brutality, disease, fetishisation of death. Fellini's La Dolce Vita
(Electric): decadence and lust in swinging Rome. Sally Potter's Orlando
(First Independent): war, transexualism, single motherhood. Taken to its
extreme, the mad logic would be unerring. We would end up having to gear all
our films towards sedating the disturbed or potentially dangerous mind.
So long as violence and other aberrant behaviour, actual or arguable, exist
in the world, so should their representation in our culture. The decrying of
films and videos as a spur to delinquent behaviour has become a tired
catcall, as lazy and irresponsible as it is unproven. 'Out of sight, out of
mind' is the creed of those who believe that moving images are a trigger to
violent crime. But a disturbed mind will find the stimuli it wants to find,
if necessary from material that can seem bafflingly innocuous to others. And
the 'disarmament' that is censorship can remove the insights as well as
incitements offered by violent art and entertainment: leaving society's true
defenders, not just society's aggressors, less well-equipped to act and
think in response to the signals offered by a troubled time.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Fashion: Real women wear the trousers - Micro-skirts are
fine for waifs but should otherwise be avoided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM

<TEXT>
Sharon Stone's legs did it. Until she stomped down Valentino's catwalk in
Paris wearing a mini wedding dress and lace tights, all the impossibly
short, floaty skirts wafting round the international collections had created
only a vague sense of unease. To be sure, they were hardly practical for
normal life but, on unnaturally etiolated catwalk waifs, they looked
innocent and charming. It was easy to be blinded by their beauty.
It took only one real woman - and a very fortunately built one at that - to
reveal the awful truth. The kindest word I heard about poor Sharon in
'those' tights and 'that' skirt was 'sturdy.' Far less kind words will be
applied to the great chunky-legged majority if they try to follow fashion
next spring.
The question is: why should the abiding image of high fashion for next
season be a garment that is neither quite a petticoat nor an outgrown
gymslip and looks good only on immature-looking waifs? Partly, it is because
of this very self-selecting elitism - you have to be one of a special band
to join in. Partly, too, it is because of the snobbism that lies behind its
impeccable designer provenance.
After Karl Lagerfeld put pelmet skirts - always a good publicity gambit -
into his autumn couture collection for Chanel, the house's telephone was
red-hot with orders. Chanel's ideal customer - and, in this case, her
daughter - may be impossibly rich and thin (rich women, whatever their
figures, always seem to have good legs) but, in reality, Chanel may be
responsible for some sorry sights.
Whether it be in the interests of a good joke or of press coverage
(sometimes the same thing), 'Kaiser' Karl has never been above over-stepping
the limits of good taste. He is also promoting the return of white
stilettos. But, no matter how crazy or unwearable his ideas, he will have
the last laugh because he is so influential that - and here is the crux -
his ideas are followed slavishly by the ever-younger band of stylists and
fashion editors who are the image-makers for magazines and advertising.
They are so mired in the fashion world that, like a drug, ideas need to be
ever more sensational to excite them. The seriously short A-line skirt -
new, provocative, even shocking - is their biggest buzz for years. They are
ordering micro-skirts for themselves already; and although their readers or
customers may not like it, that is what they will get.
At this very moment, some junior fashion editor, years younger than most of
her readers, is preparing a feature which suggests 'the' look for spring is
a micro-mini skirt worn with ankle socks. Indeed, when Daks launched a new
range of children's wear recently, the pink and white striped A-line skirt
intended for 10-year-olds was snapped up by a fashion-forward magazine to
photograph on a 6 ft super-waif.
The bug has even attacked entirely sensible people. When Benny Ong, a highly
experienced and successful designer, showed a capsule spring collection to
favoured press people and customers recently, nearly everything was very
pretty, very flared and very short. 'Isn't there anything longer?' wailed
women used to relying on Benny's graceful, long-line skirts. There were
indeed, explained the designer, but he wanted to promote a new, younger
look.
This is the real problem for real women. Every collection contains trousers
and long skirts which make sales rather than headlines and which are kept
out of sight, like dark secrets, when the press are about. But why should
women, who prefer not to look like old mutton dressed as spring lamb, be
bereft of an image to which they can aspire?
Some designers, such as Armani and Ralph Lauren, recognise this and are full
of instantly usable ideas. There is the beige trouser suit, which will be
everyone's working life-line.
There is the quiet but insistent return of that thrice-blessed garment, the
drawstring trouser.
There is Whistles, where owner Lucille Lewin is five feet nothing, always
looks immensely stylish, and is undecided about wearing a mini. She has
bought a smattering of tiny skirts (most already earmarked by 15-year-old
fashion editors) for her shops, and says: 'There are no rules in fashion
now. Women are more confident with their own style, be it long, short or
trousers.'
Now that women are independent and assertive, the waif-in-a-mini might have
advertising appeal because this is the last female image left that allows
men to feel masterful. It also goes down well with stylists, not long past
their dormitory years, who feel more at home with it than with grown-up
sophistication.
In other words, next spring's fashion will sort the women from the girls.
And real women will be wearing the trousers.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Fashion: Another piece to fit the Jigsaw - A womenswear
chain turns its attention to men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something strange happened in early November: a new menswear shop was opened
and there was not a polo mallet in sight. Jigsaw, a chic womenswear chain
which has long been a favourite of many a fashion-orientated working woman,
has moved into menswear. With 28 women's shops already flourishing, the team
behind Jigsaw decided the time had come to provide for the aspiring male the
chic and well-priced clothing purveyed to his sisters.
To those who have wearied of the cliche of the polo mallet - it seems to be
taken for granted that this aspiring sport imparts a virile, lady-killer
image on cotton-knits and moleskins - Jigsaw's marketing imagery makes a
refreshing change.
Jigsaw's hero is more likely to be found in an East End boxing gym. He might
have borrowed the squire's sporting fabrics - moleskins, Harris tweeds,
waxed cottons - but the styling recalls Michael Caine's Alfie rather than
one of the Hipwood brothers astride a polo pony.
The relatively inexpensive clothes are aimed at young, urban professionals.
It arose from the constant requests by female customers for a range to suit
their husbands and male friends.
Now that Paul Smith has turned his designing talents to womenswear and Agnes
B has turned hers to men, the distinction between menswear and womenswear
designers has broken down.
On offer are ink, peat or sage Harris tweed, three-button jackets at Pounds
135, navy, indigo or parchment chunky cable knitwear (Pounds 40-70),
moleskin jeans (Pounds 45), plain cotton shirts (all under Pounds 50) and
waxed leather pea jackets (Pounds 422). The mood is city roughwear and it is
not over-designed.
John Pawson, a 45-year-old architect known for his unremittingly restrained
taste, was chosen to test-run the collection. He loathes 'dressing like an
architect,' although he has turned the white shirt into a professional
shibboleth. His first reaction was, frankly, disappointment: 'Tailoring that
looks good on a drawing board or a dummy rather than worn,' he said.
Take the Harris tweed jackets, he said. Is there a point in buying one -
even if inexpensive - if it is clumsily executed? Is not Savile Row, Daks or
Oxfam a better buy, depending on your budget? Wearing the moleskin jeans, he
mischievously asked: 'Isn't this what you see those foreigners in - you
know, those polo players?'
He thought the knitwear well-designed and good value. Stroking his chest in
a cable-knit Aran, he added: 'I could very happily walk home in this,' and,
inspecting a plain white shirt, he acknowledged that 'for the price, this is
pretty good.' No mean tribute from Mr White Shirt himself.
While the tailoring is disappointing - a much greater sharpness is required
 -the knitwear is first-rate. Basics, such as t-shirts and trousers, are
so-so and the leathers and suedes are excellent, especially the waxed
leather pea jacket and the reefer.
Jigsaw has managed to keep its prices down because it does almost everything
itself, from owning factories and making the clothes to running the shops
and selling. The crucial balance between value and quality is maintained by
cutting out the middleman, overseeing production and ensuring prompt
delivery.
Four newly-acquired factories (for tailoring, leather, knitwear and denim)
are stocked with the latest technology, such as autojigs and jet pocket
machines.
Jigsaw can test prototypes on its own machines and the design team can
experiment with the latest fashions in its own prints and fabrics. A
substantial part of its business is based on reacting within a week or so to
the latest trends from Paris, Milan or New York.
Its factories are independently accountable and must run at a profit and not
be subsidised by the retail side. For that reason, extra capacity
(approximately 20 per cent) is leased out.
Jigsaw is owned by John Robinson, its managing-director. Chris Bailey, the
production director, has a half-share in the factories. The company has an
annual turnover of Pounds 23m and is entirely self-financed - not least
because British banks are usually reluctant to finance fashion projects.
Like its competitor, Paul Smith, it is proud of its financial
self-sufficiency.
The price/quality ratio in the Jigsaw women's range is a key ingredient in
its success. It has built up an impressive bank of loyal customers, for
which much praise must be given to the helpful shop assistants who wrap even
a modest T-shirt in tissue paper, according it the respect of a designer
suit. Jigsaw was, rightly, short-listed for a British Fashion Award this
year and although it failed to win one, it is some indication of the esteem
in which it is held by the British fashion world.
The problem with the new venture is that menswear, particularly outerwear,
such as jackets and suits, requires much higher standards of construction,
cut and finish. Men are less inclined to buy on a fashion whim. They tend to
demand longevity and, if buying a classic clothing item, such as a Harris
tweed jacket, expect it to look more than competently executed.
Chris Bailey assures me that he is well aware of this deficiency and that
the standard will be vastly superior once the men's tailoring factory opens
in the new year.
At the other end of the scale, the reputation for service, quality, choice
and dependability earned by The Gap and Marks &amp; Spencer for modern basics,
manufactured by the million and styled as neutrally as possible, will make
it hard for Jigsaw to win part of that market for cotton polo-neck skirts,
T-shirts, chinos and jeans.
Their understandably limited range cannot offer a wide choice in colour,
size and leg lengths, for example.
In this environment, can Jigsaw prove that polo-free men's leisurewear can
sell?
Jigsaw, 9-11 Floral Street, London WC2. Early next year a men and women's
store is due to open in Leadenhall Market in the City of London.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Fashion: Designing is so tough, sighs Japan's queen of
innovation - Alice Rawsthorn meets Rei Kawakubo, a major force in the
industry for 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rei Kawakubo sits at a small, square table in the Comme des Garcons office
on Place Vendome in Paris, fidgets with her silver bangles and heaves a deep
sigh. 'I don't find it enormous fun being a fashion designer,' she says.
'The fashion system is very hard. It's ridiculous to be expected to find a
new direction every six months. But my clients expect me to move forward
with each collection. It's tough.'
Tough, or not, few designers have done it better than Kawakubo, 51, who has
been one of the most innovative forces in fashion for the 20 years since she
founded Comme des Garcons in Tokyo. She is still known best for the stark,
monochrome clothes she showed in her first Paris collections during the
early 1980s. But she now has a new prominence as an important influence over
the present crop of young European designers - Martin Margiela and Ann
Demeulemeester.
'One word sums her up - individual,' says Katell le Bourhis, director of the
Musee des Arts de la Mode in Paris. 'Most fashion designers re-interpret
influences from the world around them. Rei Kawakubo is one of the very few
who is absolutely herself. She pursues her own vision without ever, ever
compromising.'
Everything about Kawakubo, from her bluntly bobbed hair to her intense
expression, exudes purpose. She sits in the Place Vendome office wearing one
of her pinstripe pinafores over a black jumper with the sleeves rolled-up,
ready for work. Her face is free from make-up. The only visible concessions
to feminine vanity are the bangles and her nails which, surprisingly, are
manicured meticulously.
Kawakubo is the sole owner of Comme des Garcons, a Dollars 100m (Pounds 70m)
company, which ranks her alongside Donna Karan in New York as one of the
world's wealthiest female fashion designers.
She exercises rigorous control over every aspect of the business, from
packaging design to insisting that her 400 employees clear their desks
before leaving each evening.
'The breadth of her vision is remarkable,' says Deyan Sudjic, editor of
Blueprint, a design magazine, and author of a book about Kawakubo. 'She is
not a conventional fashion designer who allows their clothes to be sold in
someone else's shop. She goes further than that.'
Kawakubo was born in Tokyo in 1942. Her father was an academic at Keio
University, one of Japan's most noted educational institutions, and she
studied fine art there before working as a stylist in the advertising
industry, one of the few areas of business then open to young Japanese
women.
She started designing clothes to use in her advertisements and registered
Comme as a company in 1973. The name was chosen, uncharacteristically, on a
whim. 'There was no serious reason,' she says. 'I just liked the sound of
it.'
Kawakubo was lucky. She began her business at a time when the Japanese
economy had repaired the damage caused by the second world war and was
starting its period of frenetic growth. Many of the most influential figures
in contemporary Japanese design started at the same time, including Yohji
Yamamoto and Issey Miyake in fashion, Shiro Kuramata in furniture, and Tadao
Ando in architecture.
Japan, late in the 1960s, was in a cultural vacuum, still struggling to find
a new identity after losing the war and the US occupation. Yamamoto, with
whom Kawakubo had a long personal relationship, once described their
generation of Japanese as 'rootless'.
Kawakubo turned this rootlessness to her advantage. She had no formal
fashion training and says she has no conscious memory of western fashion
from her youth. Whereas today's young Japanese designers are bombarded by
images of the French and Italian clothes crammed into Tokyo department
stores, Kawakubo had nothing to draw on but her imagination.
'I created my own tradition,' she says. 'I'm not inspired directly by other
people or even by places. I try to detach myself from the outside world and
work within my own vision. Everything is very internalised.' The result is
an unapologetically modern form of opulence.
At its simplest, Kawakubo's approach is a blend of austere Zen aesthetics
and technological innovation through the luxurious synthetic fibres and
fabric finishes she develops with Hiroshi Matsushita, the Japanese fabric
technologist.
Over the years, she has been responsible for a string of fashion 'firsts' -
assymetric silhouettes, irregular hemlines, unfinished edges, double collars
and odd buttons - many of which have been seized upon by other designers and
then diluted for the mass market.
Comme devotees are attracted less by her innovations than by the quality of
the fabrics and her hidden touches, such as the exquisite linings and
beautifully finished buttonholes. Kawakubo attracts the same sort of
wealthy, arty customers to her shops in London and New York, as in Tokyo.
Charles Saatchi, the UK advertising executive, is a fan, as are Alan Yentob,
controller of BBC1 television, artist Francesco Clemente and furniture
designer Tom Dixon.
'I love her stuff,' says Dixon. 'Sometimes, you look at some of the weirder
styles and think 'Hmm'. But most of her designs are really very classic.
I've got a lot of wear - really a lot of wear - out of my Comme clothes.'
Kawakubo still spends most of her time in Tokyo where she works 14 hours a
day with her collaborators, many of whom, such as Matsushita, have been with
her since the start. One of her latest interests is the furniture she
designs with Toshiaki Oshiba, using the same combination of minimalist forms
and modern materials as her clothes. 'I can do things with furniture that I
can't with fashion,' she says.
'A piece of furniture is a pure object whereas clothes always have to be
worn, which imposes limitations.'
Her fashion collections have softened in recent seasons. Black still looms
large, but this autumn's range includes beautiful brocades and translucent
viscoses in more mellow shades.
Some observers attribute the new style to Kawakubo's marriage last year to
Adrian Joffe, an Englishman in charge of her European business. She is as
uncompromising as ever, though.
Kawakubo visited Tom Dixon's south London studio recently to choose some
work for the Comme shop in New York. She rummaged around until she found a
lamp he was making by stretching brightly-coloured pieces of tissue paper
over a wire frame. 'Rei knew exactly what she wanted,' says Dixon. 'She
pointed at the lamp and said: 'I'll have 10 of those - all in black'.'
Comme des Garcons is at 59 Brook Street, London W1

FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: What's good for the goose . . . - First of two
articles by Philippa Davenport on the gastronomic pleasures of a good foie
gras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I can live without caviar. Black truffles leave me cold. Foie gras is what I
want for Christmas.
Foie gras is to the French what smoked salmon is to the British, celebratory
food every family aspires to on special occasions. While some of us may feel
slightly uncomfortable at the thought of le gavage, the French are
unperturbed. With a Gallic shrug of the shoulders they remind you that geese
in the wild fatten themselves up naturally, gorging as much as they can
prior to migration.
French foie gras producers may also point out that their birds enjoy far
longer and freer lives than those of the chickens which the average
Englishman eats. (The British broiler is tightly confined for its 49-day
sentence of life. French ducks and geese destined for foie gras and confits
range freely for four to five months before the four- to five-week intensive
fattening process begins).
Arguments have always raged, and probably always will, about whether duck or
goose makes the best foie gras. Goose is rarer now as it is more trouble to
raise and feed, but its devotees rejoice in its richer and smoother texture,
silky on the tongue. Duck, on the other hand, is prized for its deeper,
winey, almost gamey flavour.
What the French and the British mean when they talk of feasting on foie gras
is not necessarily the same thing. French households may be thinking in
terms of foie gras cru, fresh and raw. Failing that, they will probably opt
for mi-cuit or demi-conserve. In the UK, most people know only the preserved
product, cooked at length and sterilised in tins or jars, and many will
never have tasted anything more luxurious than a duck or goose liver pate or
parfait. Pate and parfait are the bottom rungs of the ladder of foie gras
delights, permitted legally to contain as little as 50 per cent and 75 per
cent of foie gras, respectively.
To get 100 per cent pure foie gras, you need to look for certain wording on
the label. Top of the range and most expensive is foie gras entier: whole
lobes or a large piece of lobe, with small pieces permitted only to make up
weight if necessary. Then comes foie gras d'oie and fois gras de canard.
This consists of pieces of liver pressed together.
Finally, 100 per cent foie gras is also available as bloc de foie gras. This
is considerably cheaper, a loaf of smoothly blended foie gras trimmings,
usually with chunks of liver embedded in it.
When preserved foie gras is produced skilfully, it can be memorably good,
velvety rich in texture and delicately flavoured. It also has the advantage
of long shelf life. It can be kept safely for a year or more in a larder,
ready to draw on whenever the desire to celebrate occurs.
Traditional stockists in Britain include classy old-fashioned grocers such
as Fortnum &amp; Mason in central London. Now, Fortnum has been joined by
specialist mail order companies such as Clark Trading (tel. 081-297 9937
fax. 081-297 9993), which imports respected brand names such as Auguste
Cyprien, of Perigord. Home deliveries are despatched promptly for all manner
of preserved duck and goose products, from foie gras to cassoulet.
More delicate than preserved foie gras is mi-cuit or demi-conserve. Mi-cuit
here does not mean half-cooked in the sense that more cooking is necessary
before serving. It means cooked and pasteurised for eating quickly.
The downside of mi-cuit foie gras is that it keeps for about three weeks
only and must be kept refrigerated, but discerning palates wax lyrical about
its tenderness, succulence and fresher taste.
Elizabeth Rostaing (081-788-6908), who operates a year-round mail order
service for preserved foie gras and other duck and goose products from
Landes, supplements her list with mi-cuit foie gras entier and en bloc at
Christmas only. The mi-cuit is, alas, too perishable to send countrywide;
but orders can be collected from her, or she will deliver to London
addresses.
Mi-cuit and preserved foie gras are served the same way. Chill the liver for
a few hours, then turn it out of its container complete with surrounding
fat. The fat can be served with the liver or saved for frying potatoes.
Slice the foie gras cleanly using a hot, sharp knife dipped in boiling water
and dried before making each cut.
Then serve with toasted brioche or plain toast, with or without a little
salad - say, endive or chicory scattered with thin, sliced, raw mushrooms
dressed with walnut oil.
The greatest treat of all is fresh foie gras. Raw fattened goose and duck
livers are not easy to buy in Britain but you might find them at such places
as Boucherie Lamartine in Ebury Street, London SW1 (071-730-3037); the
delicatessen counter of Selfridges in Oxford Street, London W1
(071-493-0568); or you can order from Vivian's in Richmond, Surrey
(081-940-3600).
Fresh foie gras is far from cheap, but Father Christmasses who might have
contemplated giving diamonds a few years ago will consider it a bargain at
about Pounds 45 for a 2lb liver. As for the cooking, Sidney Smith's idea of
heaven was pate de foie gras (that is to say, foie gras enclosed in pastry
and baked) eaten to the sound of trumpets, a feast he enjoyed at a dinner in
Brussels.
More often today, foie gras is cooked en terrine, baked gently and minimally
in a bain-marie. This is, I am told, a tricky operation, for foie gras is a
very delicate piece of meat which is destroyed easily by over-cooking. Too
much heat and it melts away - literally.
Also popular now is steaming and poaching foie gras in rich stock. Simplest,
quickest and possibly most delicious is to saute foie gras. Slice the liver
and season it with salt and pepper. (Alsatians would add a few spices,
Gascons a splash of armagnac).
Saute it swiftly (it barely needs to glance at the heat) and garnish it with
quickly fried apples, gently warmed grapes, or a sprinkling of capers and
chives. The meat should be meltingly tender and rich, dissolving deliciously
on the tongue.

Around Christmas there is a change in our eating habits. The beginning of
each lunch is a little more leisurely and there is a tendency to linger over
dessert.
But in the pastry sections of hotel and restaurant kitchens there is
organised chaos around mid-afternoon as mince pies are served and Christmas
puddings warmed.
However, for Michel Bourdin, chef de cuisine at The Connaught, there is no
such panic. His seven-strong pastry section is in the calm and capable hands
of Carolyn and Deborah Power, joint chef patissiers and identical twins.
They have been cooking together since they were nine when their father sold
his business and took the family on a boat for year. There was a brief
period when art school beckoned but the twins opted for catering college in
Southampton, Hampshire, and, keen to open their own restaurant, followed
that up with a management course. In 1978, aged 21, they opened The Hour
Glass at Fordingbridge, in the New Forest, which they ran successfully for
ten years.
Their ambition as restaurateurs realised, they sold the restaurant and moved
on to patisserie, working in a family-run chocolate factory in Switzerland
and in a patisserie near Lyon, in southern France. With their skills honed
it was time to move back to London.
They felt drawn to The Connaught but, having spent Christmas 1989 on trial
icing Christmas cakes for Michel Bourdin, they were told there was no room
for both of them. They did not want to work apart so in early 1990 they went
around the kitchens of London's other top hotels, returning to The Connaught
for a second interview. To their relief, positions were found for them both.
Since, they have studied hard. For two years they spent days off on an
advanced patisserie course taught by John Huber, England's 'professor' of
patisserie. They followed that with a course on petits gateaux at Lenotre in
Paris and a visit to Jean Thuries, an expert with spun sugar, in Cordes,
south west France. Talent, application and hard work led to their
appointment as joint chef patissiers at The Connaught in April.
Ironically, that new position meant that the Power sisters have been forced
to work apart for the first time in their lives. In an hotel open seven days
a week, in which they are responsible for their section's total production -
croissants, Danish pastries, scones, desserts, petits fours, the lunchtime
buffet, ice-creams and sorbets - they often have to work different shifts.
In June, Carolyn went to Canada to represent Great Britain as pastry chef in
an international culinary contest. She returned with a string of gold
medals. Deborah retaliated by going to South Africa on the fund-raising
World Cooks Tour for Hunger.
In the short term their concentration is fixed on Christmas. Producing 1,500
mince tarts, Christmas cakes and puddings, Yule logs, chocolate Santas on
chocolate sleighs and the chocolate centrepiece for the hotel's reception
will keep them busy. After that it is on to truffles and chocolate for New
Year's Eve.
They are both convinced that the future lies in setting up their own
business again, perhaps owning their own tea room and patisserie and
reviving old English recipes for cakes, tarts and sweets.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A mighty malt - The virtues of the Balvenie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the profusion of single malts on the market, it is easy to forget that
whisky companies still think their business is, first and foremost, about
blending. The Johnnie Walkers of this world are now up to 150 years old and
still going strong. It will take a while before big companies realise the
market is getting bored by blends and wants more malt.
The need to provide for blends has meant that some of the very best malts
have been restricted to a tiny circle of blenders and specialised
journalists. The only way for a connoisseur to get hold of them was from an
independent bottler, such as Gordon &amp; MacPhail or Cadenhead.
The Balvenie is interesting in this regard. William Grant was the first to
market malt properly around the world when, early in the 1960s, it
re-packaged Glenfiddich. This was such a success that it obscured the fact
that Grant had other distilleries - one of which, the Balvenie, was
considered at least as good as Glenfiddich, if not considerably better.
With Glenfiddich increasingly in demand as a single malt, however,
neighbouring Balvenie had to tout for business in 'fillings': that is, to
market itself as an important component part in the blends of Grant and
other companies. Thus, getting a bottle used to be a labour of love.
In the past few months, though, there has been rather more of it about. The
reason is that Balvenie celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, and
Grant has marked the occasion by issuing a third version to complement the
two which were available, although in small quantities. It also has
re-packaged the lot in smart new bottles.
Glenfiddich produced its first 'white' whisky on Christmas day 1887, so the
Balvenie is Glenfiddich's junior by just six years. Scottish thrift governed
both operations. Where Glenfiddich's stills were bought second-hand from
Cardhu, those at Balvenie came second-hand from Lagavulin, on Islay. Even
thriftier, and considerably more barbarous, was the decision to use Balvenie
House as the core of the new complex: it was, by all accounts, a rather
grand 18th century mansion.
Balvenie retains a good many features from the original conception. Less
than 10 per cent of single malt distilleries still kiln a percentage of
their malt; Balvenie is one of them. Some of the barley even comes from the
Grant farm, which surrounds the distillery complex. The malt is peated very
lightly, in the Speyside style. Indeed, the peating has been reduced in
recent years, so there could be a touch more on older bottlings than there
is now.
At Glenfiddich, they set great store by having retained the original
coal-fired stills. A direct flame under the still will require use of a
'rummager' to prevent the yeasty solids from catching and burning and, in
some distilleries, the rummager is considered a quality factor as it is said
to 'toast' the yeast. But because of the Balvenie's lesser vocation as a
source for blending, the rummagers were removed, along with the coal fires.
This might well have affected the complexity of the malt.
Balvenie's stills are much taller than those at Glenfiddich, with noticable
'boilpots' - a swelling in the neck of the still which makes the copper look
like some sort of long-necked bird which has swallowed an exercise ball.
Their purpose is to create a reflex action which adds to the structure of
the spirit.
The Balvenie is a rich, relatively heavy whisky - far more so than its
stablemate. It also sees the inside of more old sherry casks than
Glenfiddich, and about a quarter of the 10-year-old malt - the Founder's
Reserve - has passed through these. Being a sweetish whisky, it marries
particularly well with the traces of sweet wine in the sherry butt.
In the old days there was also a Balvenie Classic, but this has been
replaced by Double Wood - a 12-year-old malt which has been aged in old
bourbon whisky barrels for 11 years and then run off into sherry butts for
six months. Its final six months before bottling are spent in bourbon oak
and the result is a happy fusion. The sweet, fruity element is there along
with the slightly buttery character imparted by the bourbon wood.
Finally, Grant has brought out a 15-year-old, single-barrel, cask-strength
malt. This is bottled cask by cask at 50.4 per cent. Only bourbon barrels
are used to make it an uncompromising version of the 'bourbon' style of malt
whisky: intensely buttery and with an attractive smokiness - but with all
that Balvenie sweetness on the palate.

Although we live on the east coast of Scotland close to some of the finest
salmon fishing rivers, poached salmon has never excited me. When we were
served salmon fillets fried on the skin side only in a restaurant in the
south west of France, it was a revelation.
The frying pan must be very, very hot before adding a tablespoon of oil.
Then the salmon fillets are fried quickly so that the outside is crisp and
the inside remains moist and slightly undercooked (an extractor hood or open
window is essential). Allow about five minutes for a skinless fillet and
about seven for a piece with the skin on, depending on its thickness. Use
tongs to turn a couple of times.
The skinless version I serve on a bed of spicy lentils with leeks, garlic
and a morille sauce alongside. The crispy blackened skin version I serve
with a mound of finely- shredded spinach, oak leaf, lollo rosso and basil,
along with a virgin olive oil sauce containing finely-diced red pepper and
chopped basil. Top both versions withcoarsely crushed Maldon sea salt.

Our kitchen is open-plan, tiny, 9ft x 9ft, and was neatly described by one
customer as coffin-sized. To work in it requires organisation, careful
preparation and staying within one's limits. It is like cooking for friends
at home but we do it six days a week.
Dishes need to be creative but simple to prepare with, crucially, little
fuss at the moment of serving. And, because our customers are watching our
every move, creativity moves both ways.
One dish that a customer said he would be trying for himself came about
after the delivery of some local smoked bacon. It consists of a plate of
salad leaves topped with sliced avocado and finished with the hot, crisped
smoked bacon and a walnut oil dressing. Easy and effective.
Our much-praised dish with duck breasts came from a customer's suggestion.
Thanks to her, we now marinate them overnight in honey, soy sauce, ginger
and sherry vinegar and then bake them in the oven.
The small size of the restaurant does at least allow us to overhear the
compliments. One individual vegetable dish I prepare involves layers of
aubergine and tomato baked in the oven. The aubergines are sliced, salted
and left overnight so that the bitter juices run out. Pat them dry, fry in
hot oil and pat dry again.
Then in an individual gratin dish, layer the aubergine and slices of raw,
skinned tomato, finishing with the tomato. Grate black pepper and add a
drizzle of double cream, Parmesan, breadcrumbs and a nob of butter. Bake in
a hot oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
After one customer had devoured every morsel he asked for the recipe, only
to be told by his wife: 'But you don't like aubergines]''

David and Mary Adlard, Adlard's, 79 Upper St Giles Street, Norwich, NR2 1AB.
Tel: 0603-633522.
This year is the restaurant's 10th anniversary and so far Mary and I have
survived my stroke, two children, moving the restaurant, moving homes and
the recession.
One of the most exciting times in the kitchen is discovering a new supplier.
It may be the opted-out teacher with an array of wild mushrooms, the organic
farmer with Swiss chard, globe artichokes and La Ratte salad potatoes, or
the woman with quails' eggs in her plaited basket.
As a result of our latest move we now have a garden and I grabbed a tiny
area as a vegetable garden for salads and edible flowers - nasturtiums, pot
marigold, Oriental Saladini, sorrel and Japanese salad, nizuna and tatsoi
from a visit to Amsterdam. With these ingredients we serve a simple dish at
lunch - Salad of globe artichokes and La Ratte potatoes with a red pepper
sauce.
Peel the artichokes, revealing the heart. Submerge in white wine vinegar for
20 minutes. Wash the vinegar off and cook until tender in chicken stock.
Remove the choke and cut up the artichoke and dress with vinaigrette (5:1
extra virgin olive oil to red wine vinegar plus seasoning).
Cook the unpeeled potato in salted water until al dente. Peel and slice the
potatoes and toss in vinaigrette and chives, chopped shallots and garlic
while the potatoes are warm. Check the seasoning.
Discard the pith of the red pepper. Sweat the pepper with shallots and
garlic, add white wine and orange juice and reduce. Add chicken stock and
cook until the red pepper is soft. Magimix and pass through a sieve. Season.
Then assemble the dish starting with the red pepper sauce, then the
artichokes and potatoes and a great fresh dressed salad with edible flowers,
using fresh herbs. Please, eat the flowers.

Earlier this year I bought Bistro Cooking by Patricia Wells (Kyle Cathie,
Pounds 14.99). It is a book of recipes from bistros in France which serves
the sort of food that everyone loves to eat and every chef loves to cook:
Oeufs en Meurette, Estouffade Provencale, Brandade de Morue, Pommes a
l'huile and Petit Sale. All the recipes work and are refreshingly simple.
There are two fish dishes with similar sauces - skate wing with a sherry
vinegar sauce and savoy cabbage and turbot in cider vinegar sauce. Both use
plenty of good vinegar, have a bite to them but are not too acidic.
I have borrowed both dishes and cooked them with great success in the
restaurant. The sauces are little more than fish stock and mature vinegar
reduced down together and finished with plenty of unsalted butter.
Why I have not experimented with vinegars in butter sauces before when
beurre blanc, beurre rouge and beurre noir are such popular vinegar-based
fish sauces, I do not know. You need the best vinegars, preferably long
matured; the cider vinegar we have just finished from Trebethrick, just
across the Camel estuary, was more than 20 years old. I am now busy making
vinegars for long maturation.
If anyone has any old vinegars for sale (but not balsamic) please get in
touch.

Philip Britten, The Capital Hotel, 22 Basil Street, London SW3 1AT. Tel:
071-589-5171.
Last October I learnt an important culinary lesson the hard way. It is
possible and practical to adapt recipes from home to the hotel but you have
to be careful which you choose.
Our general manager thought that we should serve our own marmalade in the
hotel and that, if it were ready for Christmas, we could give it as
presents. He even supplied a recipe that correctly called for bitter Seville
oranges.
That was the first problem. Only Valencias exist in October and they are not
as suitable or as appetising as Sevilles. Then, when Sevilles do appear, the
season is short and I could not store - let alone make - enough marmalade in
January to see the hotel through until the next season.
Finally, no-one can agree on how their marmalade should taste or spread:
sweet or bitter, how much peel, how thick. Yet this recipe had to suit all
needs and would be served at breakfast, a sensitive time of the day.
I finally adapted a recipe adapting the solera system that produces sherry,
a fractional blending process in this case using orange juice and orange
peel from a variety of different oranges and substituting honey for sugar.
The final hurdle was pectin, the natural gelling agent found in orange pips
and normally extracted by boiling them in a muslin bag. On a commercial
scale this was impractical and so I searched for a supplier. A wholesaler
found a shop in Paris selling powdered pectin.
I was almost there but still the biggest obstacle remained. When the
marmalade was ready, the management assembled in front of a table laden with
toast, croissants and pots of unidentified marmalade and for an hour we
tasted, chewed and marked. Fortunately, mine came out top but toast has
never had quite the same appeal.

I have been cooking professionally for the past 44 years. Changes in my way
of cooking may therefore be less dramatic than in that of younger chefs. But
such is the nature of this profession that beneficial influences can come
from the most unlikely source.
We have vastly improved our method of cleaning scallops as a result of
watching the local fish shops' treatment of queen scallops. Our former
method was slow and messy. Now we remove the top shell then, using a knife
or spoon with a sharpened edge, cut behind the muscle and roe to separate it
from the stomach, frill and debris and lift out the scallop and roe. Then
the scallop only needs minimal treatment to remove the hard gristle on the
side.
Around this time of the year we also order seeds from the new catalogues.
Thanks to another chef I can heartily recommend Greek Cross (from Suffolk
Herbs). It is a tangy mustard-like plant that grows easily (and incidentally
runs to seed just as easily) but is delicious in salads.
More by accident we also discovered a red cabbage, red onion and beetroot
combination that is excellent with game, pork and ham. Add half the volume
of coarsely- grated beetroot and sweated red onion to the red cabbage
braised in the normal manner. Mix in, adjust the seasoning and reheat to
serve.
Finally, we make over 1,000 Christmas puddings each year. Our streamlined
production may help others. We put in a blender: eggs, apple, crystallised
ginger, lemon and orange juice, brandy and lemon and orange peel removed
with a potato peeler. Blend well, then put into a bowl with all the dry
ingredients. I have not tried it but I think the base mix in the blender
would make a nice baked pudding on its own.

Whatever happened to cuisenaire rods? When my children were small they were
the badge of honour of the design-concerned home. You left them lying
strategically around the place and visitors could instantly tell that here
was a really concerned home - no nasty little plastic thingummies to sully
the burgeoning aesthetic sense of the small set. Wooden, hand-made and
strictly educational were what made a toy acceptable in the socially-aware
home of the late 60s.
So imagine my surprise on opening this year's edition of The Good Toy Guide
* to see pages filled with jolly, brightly-coloured plastic toys, offering
the kind of joys the poor, deprived children of the 60s never knew.
There, in all its garishness, is the Little Pony Kitchen (Pounds 16.99 and
'robust enough to withstand the attentions of temperamental young chefs'),
the Incredible Crash dummies (Pounds 4.99), the Jungle Fun Train (Pounds
36.95) and the Bontempi Barbie Audio Cassette Recorder with Microphone, in
all its purple and shocking pink awfulness, (Pounds 31.99).
Toys, of course, must change as the world changes but today's child is at
least not deprived of jollity.
Those wanting advice and inspiration as to what to give anybody under eight
could do worse than send off for this guide - every toy has been tested,
every one comes with full and clear descriptions of exactly what it does,
its strengths and weaknesses, its price and a list of manufacturers'
addresses.

FT  04 DEC 93 / How to Spend it: If the going gets tough, call for the
Huskies - The tweed perfectly adapted to the shooting set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A reader writes to me in praise of the glories of the Husky tweed shooting
coat. 'It is,' he says, 'the real unsung hero of the shooting field and it
thoroughly deserves an article all to its ugly, drab but elitist and
oh-so-functional little self.'
So, Mr Samengo-Turner, here it is.
The qualities of the Husky tweed shooting jacket are, according to Mr
Samengo-Turner, an almost masonically-guarded secret and in the parts in
which he shoots (Suffolk, 'the home of shooting') it is referred to as 'the
Norfolk Mink']
(For those who are feeling sceptical, I should hasten to add that Mr
Samengo-Turner has absolutely no financial interest in the matter.)
From this, readers may gather that the jacket confers on shooting folk the
kind of status that mink used to confer upon suburban matrons - and make
similar inroads on the purse.
There are, of course, more ubiquitous and parvenu rivals which have
attempted to bring the ploughed field to the pavements of Wandsworth and
which have become the social standby of the 'wannabe'.
However, the real man and woman of the shooting and country estate proudly
sports this garment which looks like a 'sackcloth-cum-tweed-wigam'. From
this, readers will further gather that flattery does not come into the
matter. Function and insider knowledge is all.
The charm of the Husky tweed coat is its perfect adaptation to the needs of
the shooting set. 'Sometimes,' says one of Mr Samengo-Turner's shooting
companions, 'on a very fine day we will all set off in nothing but tweeds -
but come the really damp and deep mid-winter days and we revert back to our
Huskies.'
Huskies come in various forms but the one to which the shooting set is
addicted is the one that looks from the outside like a tweed jacket but
which is lined with warm, thermal padded quilting.
It is 'incredibly warm, virtually waterproof and incredibly hardwearing' -
this is a garment to last a shooting life-time. Indeed Mr Samengo-Turner has
shooting friends who are still wearing Husky tweeds made in the late 1960s.
There are all sorts of details which make it the preferred choice of the
true shooting man. The sleeves are cut so that the arms may move freely when
raising a gun (the technical phrase being a 'reverse-cut sleeve'), there are
cartridge pockets and insulated hand-warmer pockets.
There are also storm cuffs, a detachable storm flap and a heavy duty two-way
zip.
Those who want the complete look can buy plus-twos and cap in a matching
tweed. Tweeds come in quite a range of checks and colours.
Husky's order book, I am reliably informed, reads much like a cross-section
of Burke's peerage. And just the other day Prince Edward was photographed
wearing one.
According to Mr Samengo-Turner: 'If one wears a Husky tweed in London, or on
a train into or out of London one gets almost 'secret society' knowing nods
and smiles of acknowledgement from country ladies and crusty gents.
'Meeting another wearer in London causes a firm exchange of a 'hello' or a
raising of hats] Hunt followers, national hunt racehorse trainers,
bloodstock agents, farmers and point-to-point racehorse owners all tends to
sport what the Shooting Times once referred to as 'the Rolls-Royce of
shooting coats' - although these days, perhaps it should be 'the Subaru of
shooting coats'.'
Its cult status has caught on abroad, particularly in Italy where an Italian
trend-setting socialite wore one at a first night at La Scala and the
resulting press hoo-ha was such that the company opened up in Bologna with a
showroom in Milan.
Once upon a time the Husky company was a small, little-known secret which
operated only by mail order out of Suffolk.
These days it is catching on everywhere and it is stocked by gunshops,
riding and shooting shops up and down the country. In London the range can
be seen at Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1 and in WH Gidden branches.
Prices range from between Pounds 235 and Pounds 245.

FT  04 DEC 93 / How to Spend it: Sweet treats that make for an easy
Christmas - Desserts which require little preparation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If I have my way, 1993 will be a no-pudding Christmas. I shall concentrate
my culinary efforts on first and main courses and end with the simple
splendour of fine cheeses and a personal variation on les treize desserts -
a selection of favourite fruits and sweetmeats.
Elvas plums, marrons glaces and stem ginger in syrup are the triumvirate of
sweetmeats without which no Christmas sideboard looks dressed properly.
Chestnuts and ginger have never been hard to come by, thank goodness, but
Elvas plums, traditionally imported along with port for the Christmas
market, have been elusive in recent years. That they are now on sale again
is cause to rejoice - and is due in part to the Weekend FT.
A year ago, I wrote in a column that I hoped Elvas plums would, unlike the
previous year, be obtainable for Christmas 1992. A reader, an Englishman
living in Portugal, rang me straight away. He told me Elvas production had
plummeted, distribution in Portugal was erratic and exports had stopped. But
he and his family had bought one of the two factory farms still operating
and hoped to revitalise it.
Their first harvest, sugar-preserved in the traditional artisan manner and
packed into wooden boxes lined with lace-paper, was ready for despatch. They
would be happy, he said, to supply my local delicatessen and any other shops
I might like to suggest.
Fired by the enthusiastic reception for these tentative consignments, the
company Conservas Rainha Santa has redoubled its efforts this year. And
providing you buy soon, your sideboard need not lack Elvas plums this
Christmas. For your nearest stockist, contact the importer, Porters (tel:
0423-322323; fax 0423-322335)
Figs are another fruit I associate strongly with Christmas. In Amalfi, they
are split and stuffed with chopped walnuts and tangerine peel, threaded onto
skewers interleaved with bay, and dried. Exquisite but not, so far as I
know, available in the UK.
Alternative fig delicacies that are on sale in Britain include southern
Italian delicacies imported by Patricia Michelson of La Fromagerie, in north
London (071-359-7440). Available from her shop and by post are aromatised
preserved figs; figs soaked in rum and coated with dark chocolate; plain
figs (also clementines) coated in thick dark chocolate; and a stunning
confection known as fig balls.
The size of small cricket balls, these are dried figs soaked in honey and
fruit juice to make them agreeably moist, packed into a round, and wrapped
in vine leaves. She recommends them with cheese, and adds that they could
possibly be used as an alternative Christmas tree decoration.
Chocolate-coated Calabrian figs can also be bought from the Algerian Coffee
Stores in central London (tel. 071-437-2480, fax 437-5470).
From Spain come fig wheels - small, round cakes of pressed figs layered with
almonds and sprinkled lightly with aniseed. A prune and walnut version is
also available from the same importer, Brindisa, which can be contacted for
your nearest stockist (tel: 071-403-0282; fax 071-403- 5044).
Brindisa also imports some lovely turron or torro made by a Catalan company
called Alemany. Torro Granulat (known as Jijona by some other producers) is
an addictive, halva-like ground almond bar with lovely texture. Torro
Massapa crema is a smooth almond paste flavoured with vanilla under a burnt
sugar coating. The nuts are top quality, making it more nutty than sweet.
Returning to something more British, two companies vie in the 'favourite
fudge' stakes: the Toffee Shop in Penrith, Cumbria (0768-62008) and Wards of
Adisham, Kent (0227-720596). Both sell the lovely stuff by post, and fudge
fans may consider acquiring a box from each for a little serious comparative
tasting this Christmas.
As for chocolates, Carlo Melchior, of Chittlehampton, makes very fine
truffles and praline. For families who may feel cheated if denied plum
pudding, a witty solution could be to serve individual ones such as
Melchior's gobstopper-size chocolate truffle plum puds filled with
brandy-soaked festive fruits and topped with a sprig of marzipan holly.
Melchior also confects amazing chestnut chocolates: dark chocolate filled
with soft praline, encased in a green almond paste husk. (tel: 0769-540643;
fax 0884-761115).
On a less calorific note, few things are prettier or easier to make at home
than physalis, or cape gooseberry petits fours. Pull back the paper lantern
petals gently to reveal the small orange berry and dip it into melted
chocolate glossed with a little butter (or into warm fondant, if you
prefer). I like to leave about half the fruits undipped to show off their
bright colour and the unadulterated sweet-sour taste.
Christmas would not be Christmas without pyramids of clementines - so much
more intensely fruity than tangerines - and bowls of walnuts and hazels. Now
is the time to search junk shops for strong and attractive antique
nutcrackers. Few things are more irritating than just one pair between a
party of would-be nut-eaters.
Tissue-wrapped amarettis have been my favourite Christmas biscuits in recent
years, but the chicest choice this year will undoubtedly be the brand-new
Duchy Originals - gingered biscuits which are just beginning to trickle into
the shops.
Organic quality and royal label apart, these are a high-quality nibble and
deserve to be savoured slowly. They are pleasingly crisp and not too sweet,
with an agreeable background nuttiness of malted wheat studded with
succulent chunks of faintly lemony Australian stem ginger.
The biscuits are made by Shipton Mill near Tetbury, which can be contacted
for the name of your nearest stockist (0666-505050; fax 0666-504666).

FT  04 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Inspired by trees of life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those seeking decorative inspiration should head to the Save the Children
Fund's festival of trees which can be seen, free, at the headquarters of
Coutts and Co., 440 The Strand, London WC2 until December 6.
Several distinguished creative talents have lent their skills free and each
has decorated a tree in the spirit of Christmas. The range of designs has
always been vast, taking in post-modernist teases as well as reworkings of
traditional themes. Simpson of Piccadilly, for instance, has provided a
rampantly romantic tree - all pine-cones and floppy bows on a proper fir,
while Sarah Faberge's version is hung with hand-painted eggs and crowned
with an 18 carat gold and crystal egg pendant. For Coca-Cola, the sponsors,
George Daniel created a futuristic tree - green perspex triangle converging
on a stylised glove and hung with colourful crackers.
On the evening of December 6 the trees are auctioned at a gala dinner with
proceeds going to the Fund.
The Richmond Fellowship Craft Fair, which many readers kindly support, is on
this weekend, today and tomorrow at 8 Addison Road, London W14 in a splendid
Edwardian house, built in 1906. It is a great chance to buy your presents
and help a charity which provides care, rehabilitation, sheltered
workschemes and support in the community for people with mental health or
addiction problems. It is open from 11 am to 5 pm today and tomorrow,
admission Pounds 2.50.
Finally, for those Christmas shopping for far-flung relations who do not
mind the shopping as but hate the parcelling-up, it is worth knowing about
Mail &amp; Pack, which will gift-wrap, pack and send to any address within the
UK or overseas. Prices start from Pounds 9.95 for the full service. Shoppers
can either drop their parcels in themselves or organise for them to be
collected from the shops. Mail &amp; Pack is at No. 35, Savile Row, London W1,
tel: 071-287-3301.

FT  04 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Flowers for the festive season - Fabric and
foliage are fashionable accessories when it comes to decoration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you had asked either of my grannies they would have been quite astonished
at the notion that flowers could be in and out of favour. The very idea that
the chrysanthemum, the iris or the carnation (let alone, shudder, shudder,
the poor old spray carnation) would be given such a heave-ho by the
chicken-wire and 'oasis' set would have been enough to confirm them in their
vision of a world gone mad.
But I am sure that those of you who are even now planning the decorations
for the festive season at chateau mon repos would like to know that the
marigold (once a real no-no) is back in favour.
How do I know?
Well, Caroline Dickenson ('one of London's most innovative florists') tells
me so and she ought to know.
Caroline has recently turned the ballroom and other banqueting areas at the
Dorchester Hotel into a veritable scene from Arabian Nights and, using
12ft-tall candelabras decked with cream roses (not one to emulate chez vous
 -a trifle ambitious perhaps for the domestic setting) transformed a London
site into a set from the film Orlando.
In addition, she regularly does the flowers for chic eateries such as Le
Gavroche and Mosimann's as well as Christian Lacroix, Cartier and Yves St
Laurent.
This Christmas, says Caroline, it is artificial decorations that are the
no-no: 'The trend is towards mixing berries and natural evergreen foliages
such as trailing ivy, blue spruce and larch twigs with seasonal flowers
combined with fruits, nuts and vegetables.
'If you are aiming for a traditional look, use strong colours such as rich
dark reds, bright oranges and purples with various shades of dark green.
'Fabric is very much in evidence, too - ranging from bows made from silk
organza to lengths of crushed velvet swathed through and round decorations.
To add some glitz use gilded fruits such as pomegranates, apples and oranges
and nuts. Adding spices and herbs such as cinnamon sticks, anise and bay to
an arrangement will fill the room with a subtle yet exotic scent.'
Indeed, great florists obviously think alike - at this week's grand Royal
Opera House dinner at the Whitehall Palace, one of London's most
sought-after creators of magical effects, Paul Dyson, had used a very
similar decorative approach.
He had featured lots of brilliant strong colours in the flowers - reds,
oranges, ambers - and the staircase was richly swathed with flowers, foliage
and generous swags of ruby red velvet.
'Candles,' says Caroline, 'shed a soft glimmering light but if you are
trying to create a rich, warm effect use dark red, green and purple coloured
candles instead of white.
'To create a strong effect group decorations together rather than scattering
them around separately. There should be continuity in the theme. For
instance, if you are using blue pine you can use it in all sorts of
different ways - from decorating a fireplace and a staircase to forming the
base for a wall hanging or door wreath.'
The scheme photographed here at Mosimann features many of her precepts -
deep rich colours, strong groupings, fabric and, above, all a sense of
generosity. Decorations should never be mean and sparsely scattered.
Fireplaces are often the focal point of a room and a decorated mantelpiece
can set the warm and welcoming scene. Swagging made from blue spruce can be
draped along the mantelpiece and down each side of the fireplace.
Bunches of red and orange full-blown roses and bunches of red anemones (for
which 10 stems per bunch seems the approved number) can be tied on tightly
with string or floristry wire. These will obviously only last for a few days
so be prepared to change them and to put them in place as close to the last
minute as you can bear.
Bunches of evergreen foliages, berries and larch twigs with lichen can be
attached with floristry wire along the swagging to soften the look. A length
of crushed velvet could also be swagged along the mantelpiece. Add bundles
of cinnamon sticks, apples and tangerines - again attach with floristry
wire.
When it comes to the table she suggests taking several different-sized
terracotta pots. Line them with black bin liners to prevent water leaking.
Then fill them with evergreen foliage, berries, anemones and roses echoing
the colours used for decorating the mantelpiece.
A large terracotta pot in the centre and smaller ones around the table works
well. (They might also make good presents to give guests to take home.)
The pots can be linked with swathes of crushed velvet (velvet, you will have
gathered, is the fabric of the year) along the centre of the table or with
trails of ivy leaves and foliage such as skimmia or variegated holly.
Bunches of berries, foliage and flowers can also be attached to candelabras
with floristry wire.
Many of these precepts apply to decorating the tree - above all, do not
skimp, do not be mean. You should allow at least 10 lights for every foot of
tree and try to make sure the wire and tape are the same colour as the tree.
Decorations can be made from bows of velvet ribbon or silk organza, with fir
cones, bunches of lavender, tiny terracotta pots stuffed with paper and
topped with glued-in nuts and the whole effect can be softened with added
bunches of larch covered in lichen.
If you can handle all that little lot yourself you are a better person than
I am - or better organised or less busy.
The ill-organised, the lazy or the genuinely over-worked can call in
Caroline Dickenson herself: she can either supply the wherewithall (the blue
spruce swagging, the door wreathes, the flowers, the floristry and chicken
wire, the oasis and the gilded pomegranates, dried orange slices, peppers
and chillies) which you can deploy skilfully around the house. Or she will
come and do it all for you.
Her prices range from Pounds 10 for a simple arrangement to Pounds 5,000 for
a grand hall but there is a lot more in between.
Caroline Dickenson is at 5, William Street, Knightsbridge, London SW1X 9HL.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Tales of Endeavour and imagination: Recreating Captain
Cook's ship has tested the ingenuity of historians and craftsmen. Keith
Wheatley meets the team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPTAIN COOK'S bark HMS Endeavour had, like other ships of the period, a
veritable conservatory across her stern. Cook, botanist Joseph Banks, and
the other scientists of the 18th century's greatest expedition wanted
maximum light in the great cabin.
Recreating these windows became a test of will for a team of craftsmen and
historians constructing a replica of the Endeavour.
'We initially put modern glass into the frames but it looked horrible. Much
too clear,' explained Antonia Macarthur, a British-based naval researcher
who has had the responsibility of recreating the ship's interiors.
'Eventually we tracked down a long-established London firm who could make
18th century glass, full of bubbles and imperfections.'
But the quest for authenticity went far deeper than the glass in the
windows. When the wreck of the Pandora, another 18th century vessel, was
found and excavated off the coast of Queensland, divers discovered a sash
weight from her great cabin. This has been used as a pattern by blacksmiths
creating items for the Endeavour replica.
'No visitor to the ship will ever see those weights but to me, and everyone
working on Endeavour, they signify the attention to detail that makes this
replica so special,' said Macarthur.
On December 9, the 500-tonne Endeavour goes down the slipway in Fremantle,
Western Australia. Her building has taken twice as long as Cook's 1768-71
voyage which placed Australia and New Zealand firmly within the known world.
Much of the time has been spent raising the Pounds 6.8m needed to fund the
project. Of that, Pounds 500,000 came in a single donation from Garry
Weston, chairman of Associated British Foods.
But the requirements of historical accuracy have their own imperative. 'This
will become the benchmark for the recreation of historical ships. This is a
crucial vessel as she really was, not Hollywood's millionth rebuild of the
Bounty. Everyone is bored stiff with that,' said Fred Walker, until recently
chief naval architect at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, and
responsible for hull and lines of Endeavour.
'Captain Cook would recognise her straight away if there were to be a
miraculous reincarnation,' added Walker.
Since the original Endeavour was a 500-ton collier, built as a workhorse to
trade between the Yorkshire coalfields and London, no building plans exist.
However, once she was commissioned into the Royal Navy a full set of
measurements was taken at the dockyard and these still exist at the National
Maritime Museum
The only significant departure from the original construction is in the use
of the native Australian wood jarrah for the hull. Jarrah is so hard that
during the 19th century many London streets were paved with it. Endeavour
was built of oak.
Even if oak of the necessary massive sections were still available its cost
would be astronomical. Fred Walker has recently provided budget estimates
for a project similar to the Endeavour in Europe and gauges the cost of the
timber alone at between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m. Other details are
painstakingly real.
'Hull timbers are fastened with wooden trenails. I've worked in shipyards
and shipbuilding all my life but I'd never seen one driven until I came to
the Endeavour project,' enthused Walker.
There are other concessions to life at the close of the millennium. Twin
diesel engines, a cabin equipped with modern satellite navigation equipment,
and full 20th century life-saving equipment were essential if the Endeavour
was to be insured and go to sea - as is the intention of her trustees.
Once her masts have been stepped and sea trials completed off Western
Australia, the little ship will sail to Sydney in the spring of next year,
calling en route at major ports such as Adelaide and Melbourne.
'If you're not to be lumbered with an unusable hull you've got to be able to
jump through the same international hoops as any other sail-training
vessel,' explained Walker.
Endeavour will be under the command of Captain Christopher Blake, a British
skipper with a special Square Rig endorsement to his master's ticket. Blake
is currently Master of Japan's first sail training vessel, the Kaisei.
Although the Endeavour's permanent home is to be the Darling Harbour complex
in Sydney, Europe's first glimpse of her outside the TV screen is likely to
be the following year when she will sail to Britain, re-tracing Cook's
homeward voyage.
Before then, Macarthur must fill the interior with fabrics and furniture
that Cook and his companions would have lived with. The Bond Street company
of Harvey &amp; Sons is building and donating a 12ft long oak table for the
great cabin.
Joseph Banks took a bureau with him. Macarthur is working from records of
the kind of furniture he chose for later homes, to extrapolate and decide
what he might have taken on the expedition to the Antipodes.
'Banks writes about sleeping in a swinging cot. But how do you construct
one? There are two paintings and a sketch extant but they are hardly
drawings for a joiner. I think we'll have to build a few and try them out,'
she laughed, clearly relishing a historical challenge that is far from dry.
'I'm convinced Mrs Cook would have given him something to take with him,
possibly a piece of embroidery for the cabin bulkhead,' said Macarthur, with
her own special contribution to the ship firmly in mind. 'My fellow
historians will say it is fantasy but you have to use your imagination in
something like this.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / Pravda faces harsh truths of survival: Can Russia's
newspaper adapt?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On the front page of a recent copy of Pravda was a photograph of Andrei
Sakharov, the late Russian dissident. Beside it a headline read: 'The Second
End of Sakharov'.
Instead of the cynical piece expected, it regretted his passing, and said
his conscience was never more needed to bring to account the present powers
in the Kremlin.
Viktor Linnik, the new editor of Pravda, is not embarrassed by these new
affiliations: on the contrary, he affirms them. Asked in what tradition of
socialism he now stands, he eschews communism in favour of 'the tradition of
Sakharov - of conscience and diversity'.
Here is a turn-up for the history books, and one which is hard to puzzle
through: does it mean that Russia's communists now see themselves as a force
for freedom of conscience, as inheritors of the mantle of the man they
denounced, mocked and hounded into exile? Or is it a mere tactic in the long
war which has recently gone badly for Marxism Leninism, but which may yet
look up once more?
Linnik's promotion to the occupancy of the vast office of a chief editor of
Pravda gives some clue. Pravda was closed immediately after the armed
uprising by the parliamentary forces (it had been a strong supporter of the
parliament). It re-opened after partly fulfilling a list of government
demands.
There were demands for a change of chief editor and that the paper change
its name. However, internal debate was raging when Pravda was closed.
Gennady Seleznev, chief editor for the previous two years, was losing out
against both Ilyin, one of the deputy editors, and Linnik.
Seleznev was seen as too hard line and insufficiently interested in
reshaping the paper to cope with an increasingly difficult market. A staff
meeting had been called at which the issue of re-election of the editor was
to be discussed.
But then the closure caused the staff to rally behind Seleznev. So when
Ilyin was named as his successor and began talks with the government, he
lost much internal support.
A staff meeting, faced with a choice between Seleznev, Ilyin and Linnik,
narrowed it down to the last two and then chose Linnik - the centrist of the
three candidates.
He is thus neither a liberal nor a hard-liner. In working out Pravda's new
line, he will be guided, he says, by a view of the paper as 'above all an
information medium, not strongly tied to any party'.
He describes himself as 'a socialist, even a social democrat': his four
years in New York put an American twang on his flawless English, and enabled
him to make contact with some influential contacts.
His largest critique of the government is that 'it is the real inheritor of
communism: it is the one which uses Bolshevik methods'. He instances the
suppression of some of the opposition press, the bias of TV and radio, the
discrimination against far left and right parties. 'This will be our central
cause from now on,' he says.
Will Pravda survive? It is supported by a Greek millionaire with Communist
roots and, paradoxically, it also receives a subsidy from the state which
banned it.
Costs of producing the paper are huge, largely because it continues to
attempt to be a paper of the Soviet Union, with 22 printing plants
throughout Russia and the former Soviet states.
'We should get state support: we are an institution, like us or not,' says
the new chief editor. And here lies the clue to Linnik's orientation - it is
to the state and to the nation, rather than to an ideology.
His refurbishment of Sakharov is in order to bring the paper back within the
fold of the state and its present leaders - even if he continues to oppose
them.

FT  04 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: Mistaken identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now to get back to a subject I would have tackled in the past couple of
weeks except for other matters intervening. I shall not allow the week's
dreary round of comment on the British Budget to deflect me.
Last month, the 75th anniversary of almost everything was celebrated,
including the foundation of the Austrian republic. Never has this November
date seemed so relevant to current events, at least to the Austrian press.
The significance of the collapse of the empire was summarised in the
biggest-selling tabloid, Kurier. It noted that the monarchy's multi-racial
army occupied huge tracts of foreign soil by late-1918 and, 'in a typical
piece of Austrian nonsense,' surrendered in Padua to an Italian army it had
already beaten soundly.
We are still dealing with the consequences of the subsequent collapse:
Czechs and Slovaks pushed into a common state; millions of Hungarians left
as minorities and as potential problems for Romania, Serbia and Slovakia;
and Slovenes and Croats locked into a south Slav state where the Serbs
played the role of victor.
In Bosnia, there began a wave of persecution of those Moslems and Croats who
had been loyal to the monarchy. Austria lost South Tyrol and became 'the
state nobody wanted'; all the natives did want was union with Germany, so
the Nazis entered the country 20 years later under the pretext of
'expressing the true will of Austrians.'
Kurier concluded that the end of the empire was the 'beginning of an endless
tragedy of ethnic and national conflicts in central Europe.'
Die Presse adopted a complementary theme: in a modern Europe free of trade
restrictions, with open frontiers and possessed of a single currency, there
was only one historical precedent that mattered. The Habsburgs had provided
all this for a large part of the continent until 1918.
In the Salzburger Nachrichten, we read that the real anniversary was that of
1,000 years of Austria, which falls in 1996 - the year it plans to enter the
European Union. That, said a contributor to the paper, meant the country
would sacrifice a 'thousand million schillings' and 1,000 years of history
while receiving Ecus in exchange.
So, if Austria was at the centre of the storm which generated all the
European disasters of this century, it also provides the metaphor for a full
European union, for which it will sacrifice itself yet again.
The Dual Monarchy should indeed influence those in Brussels who are creating
a more boring Europe. The Austro-Hungarian model can add a dash of colour
and satisfy Euro-sceptics of different hues.
If Jacques Delors were to become, say, the Count of Brabant, he would appear
an even more attractive figure to the diverse populations of the Union. (The
title might carry with it the captaincy-general of the Belgian football
team).
Articles in Hello, and long-distance shots in the seedier London tabloids of
his wife on distant island beaches, would elevate this somewhat forbidding
figure to celebrity status.
He would be assisted by various new commissioners - the Duke of Connaught
would be the hereditary Commissioner for Peasants and Gentry, and the Duke
of Burgundy would make a fine food and drink supremo. A resurrected
Elector-Palatine would be president of the European Parliament, members of
which he would select personally.
By its very nature, the system would ensure the realisation of certain
socialist aspirations - a 'Europe of regions' would be an inevitable result.
Work sharing and jobs for life are at the core of the concept.
The post of head of state would pose some problems, though. Many would think
twice about a European emperor based in Vienna; but turning Otto von
Habsburg into a Carolingian figurehead enthroned in an already existing
European institutional capital, Strasbourg, would provide a decorative
addition to the scene. The Queen of England, as the first among equals of
European royalty, would supply the balance in the other half of a Dual
Monarchy.
And, finally, we should have a solution for the German problem. The
country's unification has not proved beneficial - it never has - so the
answer is to split it up again.
The old German Democratic Republic could re-emerge in slightly different
form as Prussia; Bavaria could gain what it always wanted - independence of
a sort; and Hamburg would concentrate on making money around the Baltic and
up and down the Elbe. Any number of daft and varied constitutions could be
provided to ensure that subsidiarity flourished.
To conclude with what might be an apocryphal tale, but one which has the
ring of truth: in 1920, a German weekly, presumably Simplicissimus, ran a
competition for the most startling headline of all time. The winner was:
'Archduke Franz Ferdinand Alive: Great War a Mistake.'
The time has come to rectify that mistake.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Gardening: Boxing, a noble art that costs the earth - Robin
Lane Fox braves chill winds in pursuit of green formality among the designer
vegetables. His bank manager is interested, too
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
I have just had a personal boxing day and it has not exactly been cheap. In
the cold winds, I have been planting rivers of green box bushes, which are
intended to curl round each other and look suitably smart.
You all know those handsome pictures in which evergreen hedges make patterns
among the designer vegetables and owners can spell out their initials in
monograms of green leaves. I have yet to choose my monogram, but I think
that we forget what they cost. Box prices now start at Pounds 150 a 100, and
the plants for a low hedge are supposed to go in at intervals of six inches
or less.
The rectangular outline to a moderate bed will cost Pounds 200 unless, like
me, you economise on the spacing and exercise your patience. Remember the
price tag when next you see a television long shot of somebody's box-edged
potager inside an old brick wall.
In the 1960s, big gardens were throwing old box away by the yard: people
believed it harboured snails and bindweed and required too many hours from
full-time gardeners. As a result, artful growers acquired some spectacular
assets. They realised that box will recover even if it is old and looking
lanky.
Old box is supremely willing to regenerate. Indeed, like donkeys, box trees
never seem to die unless dogs cock their legs continually against them. If
anyone offers you a leggy box hedge, capitalise on their ignorance and take
it before they read this column.
At today's prices, what would be the value of all the box at Italy's Villa
Lante or France's Villandry, historic gardens which sit on unrepeatable
assets? Since the 1960s, we have all forgotten the snails and bindweed and
have been hurrying to bring box back.
For some while, Roy Strong, former supremo of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum
who runs his own considerable country garden, has been championing the
movement away from flowers and back to axial green formality; a ground note,
too, for distinguished designers like David Hicks. I like flowers, because I
can grow them - but I also like green frames which look wonderfully neat and
obedient soon after planting.
If the cost is too much, what can you do? You have two options, unless you
have good friends. One is to take cuttings from the young shoots of
someone's box plants early in summer; set them in sandy trenches in
semi-shade; keep them watered; and transplant them to good soil during the
following year.
After another three years, you will have good bushes for a new hedge and,
although the delay is a nuisance, I do promise that box cuttings will root
with remarkable ease.
If you are planning a big box venture but find the prices in garden centres
ruinous, you should investigate the specialist growers in Belgium or Holland
who now raise most of the box which UK nurserymen import and then sell on to
us at higher prices. Indeed, if you need a large quantity, take a ferry over
to Belgium and do a deal with a specialist, who will supply you by the
thousand.
Despite the horrible wind from the east, I have enjoyed planting well-rooted
boxes of three and four years old. They look stylish from the start and
allow you to weave knots, spell messages, or outline a scene in green
mosaic. They are probably very healthy. Box, says my handbook of 1620, is
very good for the flux, or French disease. In those days, it meant more than
high interest rates in Paris.
Over the years, I have learned a few box tricks which are not always
explained. My favourite use of box is as a green skirt or pedestal for a
statue or urn, raised on a hidden plinth of concrete blocks. The green box
skirt hides the cheap plinth and heightens the impact of the ornament: the
trick stares at you from the best historic gardens in Italy. When the box
has covered the plinth, you clip it flat: big pots can emerge from a high
skirt, which is clipped into two levels, like a green step.
You should use the bigger box, Buxus sempervirens, for these skirts and
allow five years for it to mature. You will need more plants than you expect
 -but they add value to a flower pot, which can be cheaper in such a bold
setting.
The correct edging for vegetables and low knots is Buxus suffruticosa. Be
warned that its roots will run sideways among flowers and vegetables and
should be cut back yearly with a sharp spade or edger to prevent them from
exhausting the adjoining soil. You should clip the leaves late in spring or
summer rather than late autumn when they look most in need of trimming. Late
cutting can cause brown patches, which are exacerbated by snow and wet in
hard winters.
Old books from the 16th and 17th centuries are still the best source of knot
patterns in which box bushes are twisted into the outlines of a tapestry.
Rosemary Verey is an experienced box planter who also supplied me with my
bushes: her new book, Garden Plans (Frances Lincoln, Pounds 18.99), shows
the patterns which she adapted from an old design for the courtyard of
Orchard House, the garden of which opens to the public in the scenic
Cotswolds village of Broadway. I am sure that she would agree on my cardinal
point: before you pirate an old plan for a knot, be sure that you have
allowed enough room on the ground.
The besetting sin of most modern imitations is that they cram an intricate
design into too small a space. They confuse the eye and are not easy to
plant; the box develops into a fussy confusion. It is much better to
simplify and suit the complexity to the space available.
Verey recommends designs from various Jacobean sources, from Gervase Markham
in 1616 or the books of a gardening clergyman, William Lawson, which were
published in 1617 and 1618. I have also been helped by the geometric
drawings in John Parkinson's Paradisus, published in 1629. These old books
have mostly been reprinted later and are more readily available from
libraries.
I do, however, have a final thought for a small courtyard. In the 1960s,
designer Russell Page published a self-assured book, The Education of A
Gardener, which has a beguiling picture of the Gothic window of a Berkshire
cottage, opening out onto beds criss-crossed with frames of green box in the
courtyard below.
The pattern here picks up a pattern in the window frames, but why not echo
them exactly in a frame of green box on a terrace outside the house? Any
shape can be framed in a surrounding rectangle, and the result would tie the
house and garden together with a pretty style for a small space without
grass.
Nowadays, philistines try to force those awful plastic replacement windows
on the planners by arguing that they are 'friendly to the Amazon rain
forests.' Outflank them by planting a green window horizontally on the
surface of the garden, made from a truly green material with a style that
will outlive us all.

FT  04 DEC 93 / After 45 years, the band still plays on: Echoes from another
era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE

<DATELINE>
   PENANG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Recall, or imagine, 1948. The year of the Berlin airlift. Mao Zedong was
sweeping through China. There was a great fog in Britain. A notice was
pinned to the railings of Buckingham Palace announcing the birth of Prince
Charles. And Albert Yeoh joined a band.
Albert has been tickling the ivories at the venerable old Eastern and
Oriental Hotel in Penang, Malaysia, ever since. Only a very rare night off.
Never missed a Christmas or New Year. Albert and his band are probably the
most enduring musical group east of Suez.
Albert is now a slim and trim 65-year-old, without a grey hair on his head.
'We pride ourselves on our repertoire. We can play virtually every tune
there is,' he says. 'The girls can sing in various languages - from Finnish
to Korean, Polish to Malay.'
The 'girls' are Albert's wife, Nancy, and her old school friend, Daisy Chua.
They have been with the band at the Eastern and Oriental - known as 'the
E&amp;O' to generations of Asia travellers - for more than 20 years. In their
sequined dresses, they look like a million dollars.
They harmonise their way through My Wild Irish Rose and follow it with When
Irish Eyes are Smiling. Nancy and Daisy would have the hands clapping and
the tears flowing in many a lounge bar back home.
A group of Japanese businessmen asks for some obscure favourite from
Hokkaido. No problem. Nancy whispers her way faultlessly through the song.
Then, with infinite grace, she persuades two of the Japanese on to the
stage. They croon, rather unsteadily, with her. The audience - some diners
and a larger crowd of well-behaved drinkers - love it.
Listen carefully and you can still hear the echoes of another age at the
E&amp;O. Rubber planters in town for a bit of light relief, laughing
uproariously at jokes, slapping sun-tanned thighs and becoming a trifle
squiffy. Colonial officers with their sternly-brushed hair and crumpled
white suits, their canes tapping along the tiled floor.
The front of the hotel faces Georgetown, old Penang town. The back looks on
to the Straits of Malacca and the Andaman Sea. When the E&amp;O opened in the
1880s, it boasted the longest sea front of any hotel in the world - 842ft of
it. Kipling, Maugham and Coward, sensible travellers that they were, all
'put up' at the E&amp;O at one time or another.
'We used to play all night in the old days,' says Albert. 'There would be St
George's night, St Patrick's - all of them. We'd play the Dashing White
Sergeant, reels and jigs. And people were always dressed in their best. Back
then, the E&amp;O was the only place to be.'
It is not much different at Christmas and New Year these days. While there
are few sartorial rules, people still turn up in their dickie bows and
feather boas. The doors of the old ballroom are flung open and the overhead
fans whirr into action. 'Now, the other hotels in Penang bring in big
artists from overseas,' says Nancy. 'But we have our faithful audience who
like our music and style.'
Nancy and Daisy glide effortlessly through a medley which ranges from the
swaying palms of Harry Belafonte to Maurice Chevalier's little girls and
little boys and ends bobbing in a rickshaw through the World of Suzie Wong.
The Sarkies brothers, Martin, Tigran and Arshak, built the E&amp;O. Handsome
devils, with moustaches that could gauge wind directions, they were Armenian
Jews who travelled east in the middle of the last century. They built up a
formidable hotel empire which included the Strand Palace in Rangoon, the
Raffles in Singapore and the E&amp;O.
The second world war, with Japanese troops filing through the three great
hotels, dealt a fatal blow to the Sarkies although Arshak - who is
remembered for dancing round with a glass of whisky soda balanced on his
bald head at the 1924 St George's day ball - had by then fallen on hard
times.
'Arshak Sarkies,' says a Who's Who of the time, 'has taken a keen interest
in racing.' Too keen, it seems. All the Sarkies' money was frittered away on
the horses.
Nowadays, the Strand Palace is looking very down at heel. At the other
extreme, the Raffles has been turned into an expensive modern parody of its
original self. Only the E&amp;O evokes the original Sarkies' spirit, fustiness
and all.
Albert, Nancy and Daisy are having a little break and chatting with the
audience. All seem to be old friends. Brother Augustus, a blind
half-Portuguese, half-Chinese priest, comes in.
The circle is widened. 'Now Brother Augustus,' says Nancy 'You must give us
a song.'
Brother Augustus obliges. Albert tickles his piano. Nancy and Daisy lead the
applause.
The atmosphere is as fresh as it was when Albert played his first night at
the E&amp;O, more than over 45 years ago.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Sport: Man who counts the champ's cash - Boxing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago Panos Eliades had never been at a boxing match. Two years
ago the Greek-Cypriot accountant would never have dreamt of flying to Las
Vegas to watch Evander Holyfield regain the world heavyweight title from
Riddick Bowe. Last month Eliades scarcely batted an eyelid when a deranged
parachutist missed him by inches and landed in the ring during the Ceasar's
Palace title fight.
After a couple of years as the backer and financial manager of World Boxing
Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, almost nothing surprises a man
whose day-to-day business as one of London's biggest insolvency
practitioners makes him not unfamiliar with human vagaries.
'My accountancy colleagues couldn't believe I'd ended up being involved with
boxing. You've normally got to be a semi-hoodlum cum ruffian to have the
credentials to be a boxing promoter,' chuckled Eliades in the partnership's
offices, an elegant Bloomsbury townhouse.
However unconventional his hobby, like the rest of his profession, Eliades
can add up. He is deep in negotiations to mount a Holyfield / Lewis fight
next spring. It would be a heavyweight watershed, unifying the World Boxing
Association and International Boxing Federation belts held by Holyfield with
the WBC crown held by Lewis.
It has the potential to be the richest bout in boxing's history. In sporting
dollars it is a Superbowl. MGM are pitching hard for the fight to mark the
March opening of its new hotel / casino complex. Its gaming area, wider than
a 15-lane highway, will be the biggest in Las Vegas, and is expected to
gross Dollars 305m (Pounds 205m) in the first year of operation.
'The Unification fight could be worth as much as Dollars 54m,' calculated
Eliades. The final values will depend on pay-per-view income from the HBO
cable tv network, but Lewis would be guaranteed Dollars 10m, with Holyfield
earning 50 per cent more.
As a co-promoter Eliades would be looking for a profit on the event and, as
manager, 30 per cent of Lewis's purse - before expenses such as training
camp, air fares and hotel bills. 'Don't just look at one fight. There could
be three in a year and then you're looking at Dollars 15m annual gross
profit which is good for any small business,' Eliades enthused. 'The figures
in boxing are just enormous.
'Tyson is coming out of jail in 18 months. If Lennox can fight him whilst
holding three belts, it will be the biggest ever . . . . Dollars 100m. Even
the the nuns will watch that one.'
Of course, one of the fascinations of boxing is the difficulty of getting
even the most obviously desirable fight to the ring. Before the Holyfield /
Bowe fight could happen a contender named Michael Moorer with a contract to
fight Holyfield had to be paid Dollars 1.5m to step aside. It could cost
treble that to make Moorer step aside a second time.
There is also the sub-plot of one Michael Bentt. A first-round straight
right to the jaw of Tommy Morrison on an October night in Tulsa earned Bentt
the cardboard crown of the World Boxing Organisation's heavyweight title.
Bentt was born in the south London suburb of Dulwich before moving to
Jamaica aged six.
With Lewis being British-born and London-based, the tabloid sports pages
will soon be shrieking for an all-British 'unification fight'. After not
having a heavyweight champion for a century, the land of the Marquess of
Queensberry now has two.
The painstaking human embroidery of making the deals is down to Eliades. 'A
lot of boxing deals are never completed because the ego of the individual
gets in the way. They are unqualified megalomaniacs,' he said, with the
disarming frankness which has made him a breath of fresh air in boxing.
'There are disc jockeys acting as boxing promoters. I work on a handshake.
People in the fight game say I'm mad. In boxing you can't even rely on a
contract, let alone a handshake.'
How, then, did such an innocent abroad find himself in such a position? As
Eliades himself agrees, one has more chance of being struck by lightning
than of 'owning' a British world heavyweight champion.
Lewis was brought to Britain from his then home in Canada under an
arrangement and contract instigated by financier Roger Levitt, recently
convicted of a multi-million pound City fraud. Eliades was a neighbour and
business acquaintance of Levitt.
'Levitt is one of the greatest salesmen you could find. Sand to the Arabs. I
knew nothing about boxing, I'd never been to a fight. I wouldn't recommend
it as a business venture to any client of mine and I didn't want to buy the
contract. But I did, as a favour to Roger, who desperately needed out.'
Eliades calculated his initial exposure at Pounds 200,000. By the time Lewis
fought Razor Ruddock at Earls Court a year ago, the sum had swelled to
Pounds 1.6m. 'I'll never forget it when Lennox knocked him out in the second
round, I knew we were on the road to financial recovery,' he said.
'Being a liquidator / receiver, my job is to be pessimistic, not optimistic.
I'm pleased to recover my outlay. Profit doesn't usually come into it. With
hindsight it's been a fantastic investment but somebody up there must like
me to let it turn out like this.'
The boxer and the accountant make an unlikely pair, not least because Lewis
is a foot taller than the diminutive Eliades. But it seems to work.
'When he steps out of line, he gets a slapping,' confides Eliades, tongue in
cheek. 'Being world heavyweight champion sometimes he wants things done
yesterday, but he's only a normal human being as far as I'm concerned.
'All this yes-champ, no-champ is the end. It did for Tyson and a lot of
others in the past. When you earn Dollars 10m in one night its easy to start
drifting away from reality.'
One project the pair are committed to is a commercially-funded and run
London school for inner-city teenagers who have been in trouble with police
and other authorities. Team Solo will have pupils' fees paid by local
authorities. Lewis hopes to spend around a day a week at the Hackney
premises, which open next spring.
'We hope to make money from it but that's far from the only reason,' said
Eliades. 'Most of these kids in trouble are black and many lack any kind of
role model. Lennox hopes to provide that.'
If he makes it past Holyfield next spring, Lennox Lewis will be in many ways
a unique world heavyweight champion. British, preferring chess to night
clubs, takes his Mum to training camp with him, and a manager whose cheques
arrive on time. Boxing will never be the same again.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Sport: In the image of the boss - Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the oddest aspects of this season's English Premier League has been
the tingling sense of deja vu created by two of the division's more
entertaining teams Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.
In recent weeks, as Newcastle swept Liverpool aside 3-0 and lost 2-1 at
Arsenal, the former Liverpool players who throng English television's
commentary boxes have been eagerly bestowing their ultimate compliment:
comparing the team Kevin Keegan has built to the Liverpool side he and they
played in.
Those who have seen the old Liverpool and the new Newcastle in training say
Keegan has duplicated the methods of Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, his
managers at Anfield.
But Newcastle differ from the great Liverpool sides of the 1970s and 1980s.
In particular they lack the physical presence of those teams. Keegan has
assembled a side of quick-witted, hard-working nimble players. Newcastle are
not modelled on Liverpool, but on Keegan himself.
Keegan is not alone in producing a team in his own image. Osvaldo Ardiles
returned to Tottenham Hotspur as manager this year to take over a team
already built around the playmaking of Vinnie Samways, a man who learnt his
craft while Ardiles was still a Spurs player. At times on Wednesday night
when Spurs ambushed Blackburn Rovers in the Coca Cola Cup, Samways looked
alarmingly like a lesser Ardiles, short, dark, arms bowed, skipping past
tacklers with short choppy strides, clipping neat little passes.
But Ardiles has not been content with one little general. He has found a
place for young Darren Caskey and completed a petite midfield trio by buying
Mickey Hazard, another Spurs protege of his. The Tottenham midfield can
provide the disconcerting illusion of a swarm of Ardiles imitators buzzing
about their business.
Yet playing style is an unreliable predictor of management style. Many great
players are simply bad managers. Others find it difficult to recreate their
style with lesser players. Glenn Hoddle's attempt to build an elegant
passing team in his own image with the squad of clodhoppers he inherited at
Chelsea borders on the dogmatic. So far the team has dived into the
relegation zone while Hoddle's stock has risen. His dedication to 'pure'
football has made him a popular candidate for the position of England
manager.
There are also the managers who confound expectations. As a player Don Revie
redefined the role of the English centre-forward, lying deep and creating,
rather than scoring, goals. The Leeds team he managed could play creative
football but regarded it as a last resort once more abrasive methods had
failed. Brian Clough was the archetypal English bulldozer centre-forward and
yet his teams were built on guile and ground passing.
Nobody epitomises this paradox better than George Graham. In his playing
days, Graham was nicknamed 'stroller'. He brought a touch of elegance to
Arsenal's much-criticised double-winning team of 1971.
No-one would dare stroll while playing for Graham. Gravalues work rate and
collects centre-halves. The result is two league championships and three
cups and a team that, while it contains little of Graham's personality as a
player, is as true to the traditions of his club as Ardiles is at Tottenham,
Gerry Francis at Queen's Park Rangers and Billy Bonds at West Ham.
The only current manager who can surpass Graham's success, Kenny Dalglish,
remains an enigma. His detractors say he was lucky to start his management
career at Liverpool by inheriting the best side in Europe and that he kept
the team at the peak for six years simply by waving a Liverpool shirt and
Liverpool's cheque book at the best players.
And yet, as his successors have found, life is not quite so simple. Dalglish
bought John Barnes and Peter Beardsley and few Paul Stewarts or Istvan
Kozmas. He has continued to buy well at Blackburn.
At White Hart Lane on Wednesday the team he has built looked, as it always
does, like another collection of enthusiastic Premier League trundlers. The
secret of Dalglish's thinking lies in his cheque stubs. When he started to
spend Jack Walker's money he bought enough Pounds 1m attackers to make
two-and-a-half forward lines at most clubs, and only then did he start
spending comparable sums on other, defensive, positions. The message is
clear: the creative responsibility falls on the attackers. This is, then, a
team built in the manager's image.
Dalglish is not alone in feeling comfortable spending money. Graeme Souness,
of Liverpool, and Trevor Francis, at Sheffield Wednesday, were among the
first generation of British chequebook players, now they are chequebook
managers. As players both enjoyed success as high-priced purchases at
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, before capping careers dotted with costly
transfers in Italy. For both, the first instinct when faced with a problem
seems to be: buy an established international. It is a reliable way to build
a good team but makes it difficult to create the distinctive personality of
a great one.
Managers who were mediocre players are not prisoners of their past. Howard
Wilkinson was a winger whose playing career peaked with 22 first division
games. As a manager he took cash-strapped Sheffield Wednesday from the third
to the first division with simple assault course football. At Leeds he built
a championship team around the delicate midfield play of Gordon Strachan and
Gary McAllister. Wilkinson can simply manage according to his resources.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Motoring: Why the Mondeo triumphed - Car of the Year / In a
tight finish, Ford just managed to snatch the laurels from Citroen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a fighting finish, Ford's Mondeo pipped the Citroen Xantia at the post to
become Car of the Year 1994. It was far from being a two-horse race - there
were 15 runners - but Mondeo or Xantia simply had to win.
Two months ago, I forecast the Xantia would win narrowly. I thought it would
gain the crucial extra votes because its self-levelling suspension gave it
even better ride and handling than the Ford, and rear seat passengers had
more room. Also, its urbane turbo-diesel version had appeared in mid-summer
while the Mondeo TD still waited in the wings.
Had I driven the Mondeo turbo-diesel when I made my forecast, I might have
put it a whisker ahead of the Xantia. It really is that good, as I
discovered when I drove one last month.
Why did the Mondeo win, with 290 votes from the jury of 58 European motoring
writers against the Xantia's 264? Mainly because 19 of the jury made it
their first choice compared with nine for the Xantia. I believe there were
two other reasons for this. One is that the Mondeo comes with
crash-protecting airbags, which the Xantia does not get until next year. The
second is that a complete range of Mondeo saloons, hatchbacks and estate
cars is on offer whereas the Xantia comes only as a hatchback for now.
The fact that a PSA (Citroen-Peugeot) product had been chosen Car of the
Year five times in the past 24 years, while Ford had won only twice, could
also have had some influence, but Citroen will be disappointed. Three years
ago, its class-leading ZX small/medium car was passed over in favour of the
VW Golf MkIII and Vauxhall (Opel) Astra. At the time, it was said part of
the reason was that the French had been winning too often to suit some of
the jury.
The Mercedes-Benz C-Class, successor to the 190, was a good third this year
with 192 votes while the Opel (Vauxhall) Corsa ran the C-Class close, coming
fourth with 183. I had thought the Renault Twingo could have been third
behind the Mondeo and Xantia but, in the event, it finished fifth (174),
well ahead of the Peugeot 306 (108).
Sadly, Renault seems to have decided against ever making the Twingo in
right-hand drive. Perhaps one of the many British who admire small, cheap
and practical French cars will haul Renault before the Court of Human Rights
in Strasbourg.
The C-Class is everything one expects from a Mercedes-Benz and has
established itself already as the benchmark car in the compact executive
class. It is marginally larger, considerably roomier and more sophisticated
mechanically than the 190; even the diesels score a world first with four
valves a cylinder. In Britain, it is priced little higher than the 190
equivalents. Fleet management companies forecast low rates of depreciation
that will make it cheaper to run over three or four years than rival cars
that cost less to buy.
Saab's 900 (seventh with 87 votes) did not make as strong a mid-field
challenge as I had expected; I thought it would have been closer behind the
C-Class. But the Seat Ibiza, as I forecast, was the best of the also-rans,
attracting 64 votes. This was almost double the Rover 600's score (33) and
practically three times that of the Honda Accord (28), with which the Rover
shares mechanicals.
After that, a single European car (Lancia Delta) and a bedraggled bunch of
Far Eastern products limped over the finish, by which time the winners were
already in the unsaddling enclosure.
What does the award mean to a deservedly jubilant Ford? It will be worth
millions of pounds in free advertising and set the seal of success on the
best new product it has launched in years. Winning Car of the Year has only
a short-term effect on sales of a poor car - and some duds have picked up
the award in the past. But when a winner is as good as Mondeo, sales graphs
will keep climbing long after the celebration is over.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Sport: Overwhelmed in Japan - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Numbers. Sheer weight of numbers. That is what sets Japanese golf
tournaments apart from their equivalents elsewhere.
US events have their volume of volunteers, British events have their army of
marshals, Continental events have their posse of posers but Japanese events
have all these in abundance and then some. Rakers, sweepers, divot
replacers, scoring operatives, crowd chivviers, player protectors - in Japan
there are hordes of each and the resultant swarming effect is unique.
And there is, of course, the yen. That comes in very large numbers, even in
these straitened times. For example, Barry Lane, a personable Englishman who
played in the Visa Masters and the Dunlop Phoenix tournaments recently, tied
for third place one week and second the next, winning more than Y16.5m
(Pounds 104,000) and found himself 66th on the Japanese money list.
If Lane had won the Dunlop, as Ernie Els, of South Africa, did, he would
have zoomed to 29th place by virtue of a cheque of Y36m, or Pounds 225,000,
which would have been good enough for a place in the top 20 of the final the
Volvo European order of merit or Dollars 337,000, which would have brought
45th on the end-of-season US money list. On the course, everything was
immaculate and recognisable but different. Every hole has two greens, one of
bent grass and one of tifton, for use at different times of the growing
season. Every time a divot is taken, a woman in a uniform that includes a
straw hat swathed in an enormous white scarf scurries from the sidelines to
fill it in. Another of her like will rake the bunkers after the players or,
at some courses, sweep the sand with an old-fashioned broomstick, crouching
below the rim of the bunker for fear of disturbing the golfers.
The local caddies are all women. They sport caps with a duck bill a platypus
would kill for and scuttle along pulling a trolley, always keeping up,
always on hand to soothe their charges.
Just as the caddies are unique, so are the crowds. They are appreciative of
the foreign players, especially the big hitters, but only become really
animated when it looks as though a Japanese might win. Jumbo Ozaki is their
hero and he milks each occasion for all it is worth, with theatrical
gestures and reactions that are quite the opposite of inscrutable.
Jumbo is eminently quotable and is always likely to attribute some
misfortune, such as a double bogey, to an evil spirit lurking at the hole
where the offence occurred. He is also big business and seems to clothe half
the spectators at a big event. Jackets are quite a feature at Japanese
tournaments and Ozaki's slogan, written like most of them in English, ranks
with the best. 'Jumbo aims at professional activity with never-ending
spirit,' it reads.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Travel: All this and Reagan, too - Snapshot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The moment you see the policemen on bikes wearing natty blue shorts, you
know you will like Santa Barbara. They patrol the town centre in pairs,
mounted on black Raleighs. Whatever their abilities to catch criminals, they
signify that Santa Barbara is a place to relax.
Santa Barbara sits on the central Californian coast about 100 miles
north-west of Los Angeles. On one side are the steep and rugged Santa Ynez
mountains; on the other, the Pacific. Even though an eight-lane freeway
races through the city, there is a feeling of calm. Perhaps that is why
former president Ronald Reagan chose to live there. It is smart, quite
affluent and big enough to be interesting, yet not so big as to be a sprawl.
An exploration of Santa Barbara might start with the mission built by
Spanish priests in the 1820s on a low hill just outside the central area.
The sandstone church and outbuildings are quietly impressive and there is a
shady, beautifully tended garden where you can while away a couple of hours.
From there you could stroll down State Street, Santa Barbara's main road.
You are surrounded for much of the time by widely spaced, white-washed
buildings with orange-tiled roofs, most of them built in the 1920s after
much of the town was flattened by an earthquake.
Just off State Street is the Spanish-revival Santa Barbara county
courthouse, a huge white structure which gives the judicial process a
less-daunting aura than usual. The cavernous courtroom has a giant mural
depicting Justice overcoming Evil, and there is a 70ft tower from which you
get a marvellous view.
Further down State Street, after a huddle of bookstores, clothing shops and
restaurants, the road widens out to the seafront where the true charm of
Santa Barbara is revealed. You can walk - the more fashionable take out
their roller-blades - for two miles along a narrow esplanade next to the
sandy beach, with palm trees along the shore. Most Californians are too
aware of the dangers to stretch out for long in the sun, so the beach is
likely to be deserted except for a few volleyball players.
Nor is the esplanade likely to be crowded, even on a hot summer day. You
might, however, need to move over once in a while to avoid the four-person
pedal carts which you can hire for Dollars 12 an hour from Ocean Sportswear
on State Street.
Be sure to save some energy for Stearns Wharf, a 120-year-old wooden pier
that juts out 440 yards into the ocean where State Street reaches the beach.
Unlike the tacky and expensive pier at Monterey, just up the coast, or the
awful Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, it has style. The few ice-cream
parlours and gift shops are pleasantly scattered and do not so much grab
your money as ask politely if you want to part with it.
By now, you might want somewhere good but inexpensive to eat. If so, try The
Bakery on East Anapamu Street, a delightful Italian cafe started about two
years ago by Susan LoBello Sullivan. It is reasonably central and serves
home-made breadsticks, strawberry waffles and pasta as good as you are
likely to find in Rome.
After several days lazing around in Santa Barbara, climb into your hire car
and drive 25 miles into the mountains to view Lake Cachuma, a giant
reservoir which provides the city's water supply. Then, if you have the
fortitude, travel a few miles further up the road to Los Olivos, a
one-street hick town on the tour-bus itinerary which is peopled by loud
women and men with cowboy hats. But be warned: in the summer, it will be
stiflingly hot.
Wandering around provides a sensation similar to scraping your fingernail on
a piece of glass. It is easy to think of the answer, though: climb into the
car and, in an hour, you can be back on a bench on Stearns Wharf. Your
central nervous system will thank you for it.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Travel: Chile feels the wind of change David Pilling takes a
bus ride through a Latin nation with more than a touch of California and the
Hebrides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weather broadcasts on Chilean television pose a problem. This sliver of a
country, stretching 3,000 miles down the Pacific coast of South America, is
too long to fit on the screen. Instead, chunks looking like chopped-up eel
are paraded in a procession that takes viewers from the gritty desert of the
north to the near-Arctic freeze of Tierra del Fuego. An equivalent broadcast
in Europe would detail weather conditions along a 100-mile wide corridor
between London and Baku.
As the weatherman rattles on about a heat wave 1,000 miles to the north,
viewers in Santiago, which lies in the centre, have ample time to make a cup
of tea. It is likely to be some minutes before the report has trudged its
way to the capital - which could well be having a cold snap.
Chile's shape is not all that distinguishes it from its neighbours. The
country, known as the Great Britain of South America, appears at first sight
to have little in common with the rest of the continent.
Take the buses. Those who think of Chile as a romantic backwater may dream
of clapped-out vehicles crammed with livestock, peasants and
guitar-strumming revolutionaries, or tin wrecks driven by men with too
little knowledge of the highway code but too much of tequila.
The reality is that the buses have aircraft-style reclining seats and
attentive hosts who store your bags in overhead lockers and bring you
breakfast after an overnight trip. Chile's buses are comfortable. They are
smart. They leave on the dot and purr with efficiency. They are not romantic
at all.
Then there is the capital, Santiago. There are no signs of carnival or
fiesta, as elsewhere in South America, and no shanty towns cowering in the
shadows of skyscrapers. There is little bustle or bother from street vendors
or the incessant blaring of samba or salsa. In Santiago, the most obvious
sound is the non-stop clinking and hammering of building workers beating out
the rhythm of the city's construction boom.
In middle-class districts, such as Las Condes, Santiago feels more like
southern California than South America. Mobile telephones, palatial shopping
centres, sharp suits and slick coffee bars are signs of the conspicuous
consumption enjoyed by the upwardly mobile in a country emerging from the
austere shadow of its long-time strongman, General Pinochet.
Preparing to leave the capital to head south, I found something more in
keeping with my preconceptions. At an Italian restaurant in Santiago's 'left
bank,' the waiter flourished distinct menus - with prices for the men,
without for the women. This was the understated machismo I had expected. It
was particularly ironic because my wife was picking up the bill. The
incident was obviously a good omen. Only 10 hours south of Santiago, a mere
trifle in such an elongated land mass, everything began to feel more South
American. This was the IX region - Chileans don't go in for fancy names -
where Mapuche indians once put up Latin America's most stalwart resistance
to the conquistadors.
The Mapuches' attachment to their land was not hard to understand; the
countryside is magnificent. This was April - autumn in the southern
hemisphere - and the poplar trees, planted in rows to mark off sections of
land, flashed fiery yellow against their evergreen counterparts. Cows and
horses grazed, fat and healthy.
To British eyes, there was a certain familiarity - but everything was on a
vaster, grander scale. Trees towered and great birds swooped. This was
England in a wilder age, with an African sky. As we drove along, cowboys
cantered by the side of the road, great trunks of men mounted in the saddle.
The sky began to glower and rain beat down, drowning out the sound of the
bus's engine.
After travelling more than 24 hours, during which the rain continued
intermittently, the air had taken on a chill absent in Santiago. We were
leaving the mainland by ferry for one of South America's biggest islands,
Chiloe - although you would not have known by looking.
Storm clouds had descended to ground level and we took to a sea enveloped in
mist. A thump, some 20 minutes later, told us we had landed on Chiloe, and
the bus continued its ghost-like journey, weaving along a landscape as yet
unseen.
I turned to my guidebook to find out what I was missing. Chiloe, it said,
had a brooding atmosphere and a landscape reminiscent of the Scottish
Hebrides, but with clapboard houses instead of stone crofts. For much of the
winter, the island was enveloped in mists and rain. The reality was all too
evident so I focused on more immediate surroundings.
The character of our fellow passengers was beginning to change as newcomers
joined the city types who had boarded the bus in Santiago. Every now and
then, it screeched to a halt and a bedraggled specimen of muscle and brawn,
shrouded in rain-drenched clothes and reeking of fish, would emerge from the
mist. The vehicle, once so orderly and clean, became almost surreal as wet
hulks slid around the gangway while businessmen in suits shifted
uncomfortably in their seats.
When the mist cleared, a gaunt, churned landscape came into view. Rough and
tumble hills merged into the haze and trees battled the wind. The rain
continued to lash the windows. Eventually, as fishiness within the bus
neared danger level, the journey ended. The bus pulled into Castro, the
island's capital, which has a tiny population and a huge wooden cathedral.
What might once have been an elegant structure, however, is now encased in
corrugated iron and painted in lurid shades of orange and blue. From a
distance, it looked a bit like the sort of papier mache project popular in
infant schools. Indeed, most of Castro's ramshackle houses, which range in
near-anarchy over the muddy terrain, are painted in similar hues but the
traffic-light colours were deadened by the drab-grey sky and misty air.
We slipped and skidded down one of the steepest and muddiest streets towards
the harbour, where boats - also plastered with colour - languished in the
bay. We were looking for a hotel called the Unicornio Azul, which the
guidebook described as an ideal sanctuary from the rain.
Eventually, we found it, although the Blue Unicorn was not instantly
recognisable, being neither blue nor showing any trace of a unicorn. But its
Dali-esque structure and selection of excellent Chilean red wines made up
for the inaccuracies of its name.
As night set in, kestrels slid through the air above the trees outside our
window. The television set babbled as we surveyed the bay, listening to the
patter of rain against the water. Smoke billowed from nearby chimneys. The
wind picked up, bringing with it the sound of a woman's mournful song.
The TV presenter continued in the background. He might have been talking
about the desert in the north, or the Beagle Channel far to the south, or
the weather in Santiago. It all seemed a long, long way away. I reached for
the mute button.
David Pilling arranged his trip with Cox &amp; Kings (London tel. 071-834 7472),
which has a brochure devoted to Latin America. Its 15-day Atacama, Andes &amp;
Beyond tour includes Chile's northern desert, Santiago, the lake district
and Chiloe island. Price: Pounds 2,495 a person. The weather on Chiloe is
mild between October and March. Cox &amp; Kings also organises tours combining
Chile with Argentina, Brazil and Peru.
Pilling flew with Aerolineas Argentinas via Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and
Buenos Aires. There are no direct flights between the UK and Chile.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Clarke's mixed bag - Diary of a
Private Investor / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
:Kenneth Clarke's first Budget is, on closer inspection, much tougher than
it originally seemed. For private investors, there was much to cheer:
although it is disappointing that stamp duty on share transactions was not
abolished.
Investors with large losses on share transactions will also not be pleased
that they can no longer take advantage of the indexation allowances to
increase their loss for tax purposes - although indexation can still be used
to reduce the size of gains.
I welcome the proposed Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) which offers tax
relief of 20 per cent on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 per year in
qualifying companies. Shares have to be held for at least five years, after
which gains made on selling the shares will be tax-free. Any losses made on
such investments can be set against either income tax or capital gains tax.
I hope the chancellor will ensure that EIS legislation is drawn so tightly
that crafty accountants and lawyers do not exploit the scheme in order to
fund investors' private hobbies at the ordinary tax payers' expense. While
the chancellor has said property companies will not be eligible and that
qualifying companies will have to be unquoted trading companies carrying on
a 'qualifying activity' for at least three years, I hope that losses from
golf clubs and yacht charters will not qualify.
It is good news that, unlike business expansion schemes, an investor who
becomes a paid director of an EIS company will still qualify for tax relief
on his investment. Hopefully, this will help to ensure that EIS companies
have a better track record than the average BES. Directors with large
personal shareholdings are more likely to ensure a company is profitable and
if a business gets into difficulties it will be easier for a private
investor to step in and help sort it out.
I also welcome the proposal for Venture Capital Trusts (VCT's) which will
provide a spread of investments in unquoted trading companies. Dividends and
capital gains will be entirely free of tax. This proposal is still subject
to further consultation to 'flesh out the details'.
VCT managers should be banned from seeking high fees from the companies in
which they risk their investors' money. While I accept the managers will
need to run more thorough checks on the companies in which they invest than
would be the case for quoted companies, large 'upfront' fees could skew
VCT's towards investments where managers might benefit more than investors.
Another welcome item was the extension of capital gains tax reliefs so an
individual can defer tax on any gains if they are reinvested in a qualifying
unquoted trading company.
The proposed National Savings Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond for savers
aged 65 and over could also have implications for other investors. This new
bond is likely to suck pensioners' funds out of building societies. When a
similar thing happened with the first option bond last year, the societies
reacted angrily and interest rates on that bond were promptly cut.
Kenneth Clarke could take the view that building societies are overstaffed
and need to make economies. So the bond could prove stiff competition for
them. This could make it worthwhile for people to place funds with those
societies which might pay investors a bonus to encourage them to vote in
favour of a merger.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Holiday flat rental
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My son, a US expatriate, owns a small flat in Limassol, Cyprus which I let
to holidaymakers on his behalf, by advertising in the UK press and receiving
the rents plus the returnable deposits here; the cheques being in my name.
Sometimes I let the flat to Scandinavian and German holidaymakers who
usually send cash by registered post. The rent is about Pounds 100 per week
and the total income is about Pounds 3,000 a year gross.
The expenses are advertising, telephone/fax (payable in the UK), and water,
electricity, gas, local property taxes, repairs, cleaning materials.
It is obvious that this service is provided overseas but paid for in the UK.
1) Am I liable to UK income tax?
2) Is he liable to UK income tax?
3) If either of us is liable to UK tax how can we arrange our affairs to
avoid UK taxation?
It seems clear that your son's income from the letting of his flat in Cyprus
falls only within the scope of case V of Schedule D (Income from foreign
possessions); consequently it is exempt from UK tax for as long as he is not
resident in the UK, by virtue of section 18(1) (a) (iii) of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It is also exempted from UK tax by articles 6
and 22 of the US-UK double taxation convention, for as long as he is
resident in the US.
You may like to ask your tax office for the free booklet IR20 (Residents and
nonresidents: liability to tax in the UK).

FT  04 DEC 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Share transfer query
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I would like to give some of the shares I own to my children on condition
that the dividends are paid directly to my wife by the company registrars.
Do you know if the registrars would carry out such a wish and, furthermore,
would this arrangement be acceptable to the Inland Revenue?
That is to say for tax purposes would my wife show these dividends on her
tax returns but not my children even though the shares are registered in
their names?
What are you trying to achieve? If you mean that you want the dividends paid
to your wife in her capacity as the children's guardian (to be credited to
accounts in names such as 'Mrs Maggie Briefcase for Adam Briefcase (a
minor)', then that should be possible: you could, for example, transfer the
shares into your wife's name with a distinguishing designation for each
child, eg each child's initials, making it clear in a formal letter to her
that it is not your intention to confer any beneficial interest in the
shares upon her personally.
On the other hand, if you mean that you want your wife to be able to spend
the proceeds of the dividend warrants just as she pleases, then you would
have to create a trust, giving your wife a life interest or an interest for
a fixed term.
This is something which you should discuss with a solicitor; it may be
prohibitively expensive, unless you are talking about substantial sums. In
this case, the dividends would probably be taxed as though they were your
own income.
In the situation outlined in the first paragraph, the dividends would only
be taxed as though they were your own income if they amounted to Pounds
80.01 or more in each tax year, by virtue of section 663(4) of the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The figure of Pounds 80.01 is based upon the assumption that (a) you are
talking about shares in UK companies and (b) the rate of tax credit does not
change from the current one-quarter.
As we so often have to say to readers who seek our help, we could have given
you a simpler and more helpful reply if you had given us more precise facts
and figures.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Miras just when will it all end? -
Property / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only one question is left concerning mortgage-interest relief from income
tax (Miras), now that the chancellor has reduced it to 15 per cent from
April 1995 on the unchanged first Pounds 30,000 of a loan. When will it go
for good?
It was 40 per cent three years ago. It is now 25 per cent and it comes down
to 20 per cent in April 1994. It is a terminal case.
But the fall in interest rates more than compensates for the Miras cuts, and
houses are more affordable now than five years ago. For buyers of expensive
houses the cuts are negligible. First-time buyers, the TSB calculates, need
26 per cent of their take-home pay to service a typical mortgage, the lowest
figure for 10 years. That will rise to 28 per cent in April with the Miras
changes, and to 29 per cent in April 1995 - still an attractive ratio.
Another lollipop is that chancellor Kenneth Clarke is not applying his new 3
per cent tax on insurance premiums to long-term endowment assurance linked
to a mortgage. But this is not a reason in itself for taking an endowment
mortgage rather than an old-fashioned repayment mortgage. Endowment returns
are less than they were, while repaying always reduces the loan - and the
danger of negative equity.
The slow demise of Miras continues to put renting more on a par with owning.
People enjoy more flexibility when distancing themselves from the capital
commitment of buying, and it encourages owners to consider becoming private
landlords.
Gross returns of 8 to 10 per cent are possible - and the net will be better
than most forms of saving - and with assured shorthold lets owners know they
can return.
The eventual removal of the Miras tax perk will help the public to see that
owning one's own home does not have to be the top item in everybody's
financial planning. Renting releases money for more productive investments,
and stepping away from owning makes 1980s-type price booms less likely to
happen again.
The London property market escaped from its slough of despond a year ago
when foreigners, seeing how affordable good properties had become, began to
buy. But too few houses and flats are for sale in central London to satisfy
would-be purchasers, many of whom are, by now, British.
In the past 12 months, the agent Aylesford has sold many properties, 15 of
them with an aggregate value of Pounds 40m. Demand is strong for houses over
Pounds 1m, in excellent condition with six to seven bedrooms and gardens
and, preferably, freehold. Since May, the average price for houses sold by
the firm's Chelsea house section has been Pounds 1.4m. For large family
flats, preferably in Eaton Square, Cadogan Square or Onslow Square, buyers
expect to pay more than Pounds 500,000. Lassmans, another agent, finds that
foreigners look to Belgravia, Mayfair, St James's and 'the better parts of
South Kensington.'
Flats must be in tip-top condition to attract buyers from Hong Kong and
elsewhere in the Far East who want them as long-term (post-1997)
investments. With many of the bargains and repossessions sold, the market is
now more orderly. Its slight tilt to favour vendors will translate into
higher prices.
Astonishing it might be, but Eilean Aigas, the island in the middle of the
Beauly river in Inverness-shire which came to market in the summer, has not
sold. Savills (031-226 6961) has now reduced the price 25 per cent and
invites offers over Pounds 600,000. That buys a 60-acre island idyll (FT,
July 10) that has been in the Fraser family for 600 years.
Any bids for lot nine, an obelisk and 35.5 acres? On Thursday, that will be
the last item in an auction at Thornhill Park, near Sherborne, Dorset. Sir
James Thornhill, architect of Moor Park in Hertfordshire and painter of the
great hall at Blenheim Palace, designed the grade II* house (lot one) in
1730 and put up the obelisk (grade II) to honour the marriage of George II
and Queen Caroline. The guide price for the house is Pounds 350,000, and
Pounds 45,000 for the obelisk and land. The other lots are cottages and
land. The agents are Michael de Pelet (0935-812 236), Symonds and Sampson
(0305-264172) and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171).
If you have no luck with the Dorset obelisk on Thursday, continue to
Somerset to bid for a bear pit on Friday. Said to be the country's last
surviving pit for bear baiting, it can be found at the back of Cricket Court
at Cricket Malherbie near Ilminster, a grade II Georgian house. Guide price
is in the range of Pounds 170,000-Pounds 210,000. Greenslade Hunt
(0460-52171) will conduct the auction on instructions from Hambro
Countrywide Relocation.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Loopholes go, lures stay -
Profit-related pay / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke's Budget speech might have been expected to reflect
satisfaction at the success of the government's profit-related pay (PRP)
legislation. Instead, he joined the sceptics who believe too many companies
are introducing PRP to grab the tax relief on offer and not to create a
genuine link between wages and profits. But while Clarke has now blocked two
of the more blatant loopholes, PRP's tax-saving charms remain largely
intact.
PRP is pay which varies in line with changes in the profits of the
employer's business. It is usually calculated by applying a specific
percentage to the company's profits; this amount will be the PRP 'pool.' PRP
paid under a scheme registered with the Inland Revenue is tax-free up to a
limit of 20 per cent of salary or, if less, Pounds 4,000. Hence, a 40 per
cent taxpayer can reduce his tax bill by up to Pounds 1,600 a year while
someone only taxed at the basic rate will have a maximum benefit of Pounds
1,000.
Any rational employer will welcome the chance to help staff to pay less tax;
indeed, some may even hope to split the gain with their workers by, for
example, using PRP as a justification for a wage freeze. At the same time,
few companies - or, for that matter, employees - relish the uncertainty
inherent in a genuine pay/profits link.
So, for the past few years, tax advisers have been racking their brains to
devise PRP schemes which combine tax efficiency with predictability. But one
type, which possessed both qualities in full measure, was killed off by the
Budget.
It exploited the fact that an employer can impose an upper limit on the
percentage of its profits which are to be taken into account for PRP
purposes. The lowest limit which can be set is 160 per cent of profits in
the previous year. Hence, a company which earned profits of Pounds 200,000
in the year before it started PRP could stipulate that, if it earned more
than Pounds 320,000 in its PRP year, the profits above Pounds 320,000 would
be disregarded. This upper limit is a sensible way to protect a company
against freak results. In the wrong hands, however, it has been used for
more devious purposes.
The trick is for an employer to persuade staff to sacrifice part of their
salary in return for PRP. If payroll costs are significant in relation to
profits, then the salary reductions will give a considerable boost to the
bottom line. If it is clear that, as a result, profits will rise by more
than 60 per cent, the company can rest assured that the figure to be used
for calculating the PRP pool will be 160 per cent of the previous year's
profits.
Armed with this information, the employer will be able to calculate the PRP
percentage that will produce precisely the amount of PRP it wishes to pay
out. And the employees, knowing how much PRP they will get, should have no
qualms about a wage cut.
The chancellor has now ruined this device by legislating that where a
company's payroll costs are lower in its PRP year than in the preceding
year, the 60 per cent threshold will be pushed up so as to negate the impact
of the fall in salaries.
Apart from the need for a genuine link with profits, the other main strand
of the government's PRP philosophy is that the benefits should be shared out
between employees on an equitable basis. Payments pro rata to salary are
acceptable - but not a scheme in which higher-paid staff receive more than
they should.
Companies have been flouting this egalitarian ethos by exploiting the
concessions granted to 'special schemes.' These are schemes which include
employees of only part of a business but use the profits of the whole
enterprise when calculating PRP.
Without such a concession, companies wanting to set up separate schemes for
each constituent part of the business would be unable to include the
'non-productive' units. In practice, however, companies have exploited the
special scheme rules in order to pay disproportionately large amounts of PRP
to a favoured group of employees, such as headquarters staff.
Clarke has blown the whistle on this type of discrimination. From now on,
the ratio of PRP to payroll in a special scheme must be no higher than the
equivalent ratio for the rest of the company's work force.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: A lure for equity capital - The
Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's most significant innovation for small businesses was
designed to entice equity capital into unquoted companies. The small
business lobby has long argued that people are discouraged from taking the
greater risk of investing in unquoted companies because of the tax system.
The chancellor went some way towards redressing that imbalance.
First, he extended capital gains tax re-investment relief to cover gains
made from any source that are re-invested in unquoted companies. This means
a private investor with publicly quoted shares, or a manager with share
options, can sell his or her investment and pay no CGT if the capital gain
is reinvested in an unquoted company. This measure goes much further than
the roll-over relief introduced in the March budget.
Secondly, the chancellor has replaced the business expansion scheme with an
enterprise investment scheme, which will allow investment in unquoted
trading companies from January 1. The maximum any company can raise has been
increased from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1m and any individual's investment
from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 100,000. The companies have to be trading -
assured tenancy property companies, which gave the BES such a bad name - are
excluded.
If the BES is anything to go by, the financial services industry will
already be looking for loopholes. But the EIS seems better targeted, says
Louglin Hickey of KPMG. By limiting the up-front tax relief to 20 per cent,
it puts more pressure on the investee company to perform; with 40 per cent
up-front relief under the BES, most of the return was secured by the low
initial net-cost.
Investors will also be able to write off losses on the sale of unquoted
shares against either income or capital gains tax relief. This should make
investors less risk averse.
This measure has excited business angels, who could become a more important
source not only of equity capital but of expertise. 'These are the most
attractive and appropriate incentives given to business angels and
entrepreneurs,' says Hamish Steven- son, director at Venture Capital Report,
the UK's most established marriage bureau for businesses and business
angels. 'Investors can now be paid directors and contribute their much
needed expertise as well as hard cash.'
Thirdly, the new venture capital trusts will allow private investors who may
not want to invest in a single EIS to invest in a portfolio of unquoted
trading companies. The government will issue a consultation paper in the new
year and promises details in the 1995 finance bill.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: An early Christmas - The Budget and
You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday, the chancellor announced a string of measures that will help
smaller businesses. Richard Gourlay assesses the changes
It was greeted as the 'best budget for small businesses in years' and
'strong recognition of the problems that small businessmen and women face.'
When Kenneth Clarke sat down after the first unified budget, there was
little doubt that the small business community had enjoyed an early
Christmas feast. Accountants, chambers of commerce and a host of lobby
groups said almost all their pleadings had been accommodated.
True, the chancellor did little with capital allowances to stimulate
investment in a direct fashion. And there was no joy for those calling for a
subsidised loan scheme for small companies.
But there was much for small businesses to applaud, from measures to raise
fresh equity for unquoted companies, moves to curb the late payment of debts
and an assault on the paper work that can bury an entrepreneur.
After many years of lobbying, legislation to bring in a statutory right to
interest on overdue debts is on the horizon. Or is it?
The chancellor could hardly have sounded more supportive of legislation.
But almost before he had sat down the Department of Trade and Industry
stressed that legislation was only one option. Weaker proposals, including
the voluntary approach which many business groups say has completely failed
would be considered during a four-month consultation period.
The Forum for Private Businesses says that at any one time small businesses
are owed more than than Pounds 50bn in overdue debts. This depresses cash
flow for many companies struggling to raise funds from reluctant banks. The
constant chasing of debts is also a drain on management time.
But there are problems with legislation. The most fundamental is that it
would not alter the balance of power between small suppliers and large
customers. It would take a very gutsy supplier to pursue claims through the
courts.
Forcing companies to reveal the how much they were delaying payments might
provide some form of moral suasion. Allowing suppliers to accrue interest
and charge it, say when they ceased supplying a company, might add to the
smaller business's armoury.
Ultimately smaller businesses might be best served by the publicity that
late payment receives. 'Legislation would provide something of a culture
change in payment practices,' said Richard Brown of the British Chambers of
Commerce. Small businesses will immediately benefit from modifications to
the uniform business rate. Many properties in England and Wales are still
covered by transitional relief to the higher rates that emerged from
introduction of the UBR in 1990. The chancellor has halved the maximum
increase in that increase. Owners of large properties will next year pay a
maximum 10 per cent increase in their rates bill, where previously they were
facing a 20 per cent increase; the rise for smaller businesses will be 7.5
per cent.
The relief is only temporary. Small businesses in the north of England will
be aware that they will bear a greater proportion of the total business
rates burden after the next property revaluation in April 1995 because of
the relative fall in property values in the south.
The chancellor also gave an early Christmas to about 30,000 smaller
companies. He has lifted the profits threshold below which the smaller
company corporation tax rate of 25 per cent applies from Pounds 250,000 to
Pounds 300,000. He has also widened the band for paying a marginal rate of
35 per cent to companies with profits between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds
1.5m. Above this the full rate remains at 33 per cent.
The chancellor also cut employers' national insurance contributions by one
percentage point for staff earning less than Pounds 200 a week. The main
rate fell 0.2 percentage points. One of the more notorious loophooles,
however, has been closed. Companies will no longer be able to pay bonuses in
kind and avoid NI contributions and PAYE.
On sickness pay, smaller companies were also picked out for favourable
treatment. The chancellor raised the level for full reimbursement of
statutory sickness pay to cover companies paying Pounds 20,000 in national
insurance bills. Previously the cut-off was Pounds 16,000. Companies will
also be repaid within four weeks instead of the current six weeks. About
500,000 companies will be freed from the annual grind of preparing for a
full audit. Companies with sales below Pounds 90,000 will no longer be
required to produce any external verification of their accounts. The
chancellor said that most companies with sales between Pounds 90,000 and
Pounds 350,00 will only need an independent accountants report. However,
banks are likely to remain as anxious as ever to have independent
verification of their clients' financial affairs before lending.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Offshore perks curbed - Funded
unapproved retirement benefit schemes / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget dealt a blow to an increasingly popular offshore pension scheme
that has allowed high earners to build substantial tax-free cash lump sums.
Over the past five years, certain executives have each been making
contributions of over Pounds 50,000 a year to offshore trust funds now
thought to be worth about Pounds 50m. These trusts, known as offshore Furbs
(funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes), were an innovative response
to the 1989 Budget clampdown on pension tax benefits for high earners.
The latest Budget measure will affect all new offshore Furbs, but existing
arrangements will still be able to retain their attractive tax benefits -
providing the rules of the schemes are not altered.
Furbs were designed to top up pensions for employees caught by the 'earnings
cap,' now Pounds 75,000 but rising to Pounds 76,800 for the 1994/95 tax
year. The cap affects members of company pension schemes set up after the
1989 Budget and members who joined any company scheme after June 1, 1989.
For these employees, the maximum contributions to Inland Revenue-approved
pension schemes for this tax year are limited to Pounds 11,250 (15 per cent
of Pounds 75,000), while the maximum pension is Pounds 50,000 (two-thirds of
the cap).
Furbs are company schemes recognised by the Revenue but 'unapproved' for tax
purposes. Those set up in the UK do not qualify for tax relief on
contributions or tax-free roll-up of the fund, both of which are standard
reliefs on 'approved' schemes.
Benefits taken in the form of pensions are taxed, although only at 25 per
cent. Lump sums can be paid tax-free and, for that reason, most Furbs have
been set up to provide benefits in this form. Death-in-service benefits can
be paid under discretionary trusts and, therefore, free of inheritance tax
(IHT). Since Furbs are unapproved, there is no limit on contributions or
benefits.
Until the latest Budget, offshore Furbs offered all these advantages, but
with the added attraction that little or no income and capital gains tax was
paid on the fund. This resulted in a much larger lump sum on retirement than
would have been available under an onshore Furbs, which does not enjoy
tax-free roll-up.
The Budget has scuppered this offshore strategy. The lump sum that is taken
from any Furbs established after November 30 will be taxed at the employee's
top rate. The tax will be charged on the difference between total
contributions paid in and the total fund that emerges at retirement. In this
way, the chancellor will bring lump sum payments from offshore Furbs in line
with those onshore.
Neil Campbell, manager of pensions consultant Brown Barnett Waddingham,
said: 'There is no doubt that the chancellor has wiped out the main purpose
of offshore Furbs.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Freed from VAT - The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Potentially the most immediate benefit for smaller companies from the Budget
is the change to the rules governing VAT registration. By raising the
threshold from companies with sales of Pounds 37,600 to Pounds 45,000 with
immediate effect, the chancellor says some 75,000 companies will no longer
need to register. This threshold has almost doubled over the last three
years, removing a raft of companies from a net believed to be earning the
Customs and Excise little or nothing.
'This relieves an awful administrative burden and makes smaller companies
more competitive with larger companies', says Richard Brown, deputy
director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce. But business owners
would be well advised to hurry slowly before celebrating by burning VAT
returns.
The first danger is that a business's sales may unexpectedly jump above the
registration threshold. A business would have stopped charging VAT once it
de-registered. But once the threshold was breached, Customs and Excise could
assume VAT had been charged on all cash received by the business and might
demand repayment, said Loughlin Hickey, partner at KPMG Tax Advisers. Before
de-registering, businesses should consider with their accountants where
sales are likely to be in the medium term.
There is another consideration. While filling in VAT forms is a harrowing
experience, businesses may be enjoying an indirect benefit. 'One of the
disciplines of VAT is it makes people keep accurate records,' says Hickey.
These might become increasingly important given the move towards
self-assessment of income tax. From 1996, individual taxpayers will have to
calculate their own tax liability. Many smaller businesses which are
unincorporated and with sales below the VAT threshold will also have to
adopt self-assessment. The Inland Revenue will almost certainly make
sporadic audits of individuals who will, therefore, need good records to
support what they have declared.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Tax-free gold barred - Payments in
Kind / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees can no longer look forward to a gold bar in their Christmas
stockings. The government has closed a loophole which exempted payments in
commodities from the National Insurance net.
The Department of Social Security (which is responsible for NI) has been
fighting a cat-and-mouse battle with employers and their accountants for
some years. The key element was that payments-in-kind were exempted from NI;
with no upper limit on employers' NI, there was every incentive for
companies to find unusual ways of paying staff.
Every time, the DSS blocked an NI avoidance scheme, such as gilts or unit
trusts, some bright accountant thought of a new one. The last change in
regulations, which referred to 'financial securities', turned the focus to
commodities.
Gold bars were the most common option, with the gold being held in Hong Kong
or Switzerland, to avoid VAT. By arrangement with a bullion dealer, the
employee quickly turned the gold into cash. Other commodities used have
included coffee beans, giving employees the choice between Gold Blend and
gold bars.
'These schemes were becoming fairly widespread, especially in the City,'
said David Rothenburg of accountants Blick Rothenburg. 'I don't think anyone
believed it was going to be allowed to continue.'
The new regulations ensure that gold bullion, other tradable assets
(principally commodities), and vouchers representing them, are brought into
the NI net. The regulations achieve this by introducing a liability for NI
contributions on 'any payment made in the form of a beneficial interest in
any asset capable of being sold on a recognised investment exchange or the
London Bullion Market.'
The Inland Revenue is also cracking down on commodity schemes, which have
been used to avoid the Pay as You Earn system. The advantage of commodity
payments was that, while employees were still liable to tax, they had to pay
it much later than under the PAYE system.
The Revenue proposes to make employees account for PAYE tax when they pay
their staff in marketable assets or 'with assets which are not immediately
marketable, but where the employer arranges for the employee to convert them
into cash.' PAYE will also be applied to vouchers and credit tokens which
are used to provide these assets.
The Revenue regulations will come into effect after Royal Assent to the
Finance Bill. The NI rules came into effect at midnight on Budget day.
It is not clear whether the cat and mouse game can continue. According to
Caroline Garnham, tax and trusts specialist at solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons,
'any loopholes will depend on the legislation. Until one sees the
legislation, one can't see where the loopholes will be.'
However the DSS said it would 'continue to monitor closely any new schemes
designed to circumvent liability for NICs. This will include cases where
employers introduce convoluted remuneration packages which have no
discernible advantage other than a limitation of NI liability.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: 'Victims' get a break - Employee
loans / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheap or interest-free loans provided by employers have been taxable as a
benefit in kind for staff earning Pounds 8,500 a year or more. But the
Inland Revenue now accepts that the rules can operate capriciously and has
announced a thorough reform of the legislation, writes David Cohen.
Such a loan will be taxable only to the extent that the interest rate is
less than the 'official' rate - the taxable amount is the extra interest
that would have been due, had the loan been at the official rate.
The official rate is set from time to time by the Revenue and is intended to
be broadly in line with mortgage rates. But this has swept up two categories
of employee who should never have been caught in this particular tax net.
The first comprises employees of banks and building societies who borrow
from their employer on the same terms as ordinary members of the public. It
is not unusual for mortgage rates to be below the official rate; while the
official rate is 7.75 per cent at present, some lenders are offering
mortgages under 7 per cent.
In future, employees of a company which lends money as part of its business
and who receive loans on the same terms as outsiders will be exempt from
tax, provided that the loans to the public are more than just a token few.
The other innocent victims are those who borrow in a foreign currency.
Interest rates in currencies other than sterling will usually bear no
relation to the official rate. But an employee who borrows yen at 4 per cent
now will still be taxed on 3.75 per cent (7.75 - 4.0), even if 4 per cent is
the market rate in Japan.
Acknowledging the potential injustice, the Revenue will in future be
prepared to set a lower official rate for loans in a foreign currency where
interest rates in that country are significantly lower than in the UK. But
an employee will be entitled to take advantage of a foreign official rate
only if he normally lives in that country and has actually lived there in
the present year or the previous five years.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Old to pay more - Private medical
insurance / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private medical insurance will become more expensive for the elderly.
Private medical insurance premiums will be subject to the new 3 per cent
levy from October 1 1994 and tax relief will be limited to 25 per cent from
April 6 1994.
The over-60s enjoy tax relief at their highest marginal rate as a way of
making private medical insurance more affordable for those leaving a
company's private scheme because of retirement. Martin Werth at Munich Re,
the reinsurance company, said he expected tax relief to fall to 15 per cent
eventually, in line with other tax relief cuts, such as mortgage interest
relief.
But the government is simplifying rules for insurers so that a PMI contract
will no longer have to be certified by the Inland Revenue before becoming
eligible for tax relief. Some married couples will benefit from one change.
Under current rules, relief can be given where a contract covers a married
couple, so long as one partner is aged 60 or over. But if one partner dies
and the other is younger than 60, he or she does not receive relief for
further premium payments into the contract. The new rules will allow the
surviving spouse to obtain relief for the remainder of the contract and will
apply to payments on or after April 6 1994.
The chancellor has made a change which will affect adversely those with
permanent health insurance - the type designed to provide a replacement
income when someone becomes too ill to work for an extended period.
Someone taking benefits from a PHI scheme can find that they are able to
claim income tax relief on the benefits for up to two years depending on the
date they first received the benefits. If, for example, they took benefits
near the beginning of a tax year they would enjoy the income tax exemption
for the rest of that year and the next year. However, the exemption is
limited to 12 months. The change will take effect from April 6 1994.

Regalian Properties has been hurt by the property decline but business is
picking up and three board members including the chairman and chief
executive and finance director have all bought stock, increasing their
stakes considerably.
Kenwood Appliances came to the market in July 1992 and has performed
strongly since. Following the interim results,,six board members have sold
stock at 316p. Each retains a sizeable number of shares.
Forward has been a strong performer over the past 12 months, outperforming
the market by more than 158 per cent. Interim results showed good growth. In
May, the chairman and chief executive sold stock at 223p. Since then, the
shares have shown further increases to trade around 230p level. P. Starkey
is another director to take advantage of the price increase and sold stock
shortly after coming to the main board.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Doubts over child grant - Social
security / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Child care allowance was the only social security measure announced in the
Budget to get a welcome from interested bodies on the day. But enthusiasm
cooled as its restricted scope became plain. Essentially, the allowance will
apply only to the poorest lone parents, mostly women, and can be claimed
only by someone on family credit.
If the individual is spending money on child care, the DSS will 'disregard'
up to Pounds 40 of their earnings when calculating the credit. Under the
complex credit rules, that translates into a maximum benefit of Pounds 28 a
week. It will be available only to people working at least 16 hours a week
and paying registered child-minders for care of under-11s.
'Does it meet the full cost of paying child care for a 37-hour week? No, of
course it doesn't,' said Treasury financial secretary Stephen Dorrell. He
explained that the allowance was aimed at getting people back into the work
force: women with relatively low earning potential now deterred from taking
work by the cost of child care.
The allowance could, however, have the side effect of saving the government
from a further appearance in the European Court. The Child Poverty Action
Group had been backing an action claiming the government discriminated
unfairly against women by not taking account of child care costs when
calculating family credit, since far more women than men have responsibility
for children. A CPAG spokeswoman said the plaintiff would have to decide
whether to go ahead with the case.
Introduction of an incapacity benefit caused anger and consternation among
organisations representing disabled people, who said it was wrong of the
government to target savings of Pounds 1.5bn rather than aiming to meet
needs. One of the benefit's most controversial aspects is the new medical
assessment.
Social security secretary Peter Lilley said medical controls for the
invalidity benefit - which it will replace - had been weakened by the fact
that, in deciding whether someone was incapable of work, 'non-medical
factors such as age, educational qualifications and labour market conditions
have to be taken into account.' But Marilyn Howard of the Disability
Alliance said such factors were an essential part of deciding ability to
work, adding: 'It has been recognised in law since 1946 and the National
Insurance Act, and even prior to the first world war, that incapacity for
work must have regard to the work an employer would be prepared to pay for
and the work someone could be expected to do.'
Meanwhile, the CPAG believes the 'job-seekers allowance' - to replace
unemployment benefit in 1996 but with a new maximum of six months - could
land the government in the European Court because, inevitably, it would
discriminate against women. The CPAG said someone who lost her job and
failed to find another within six months would be unable to claim income
support if she had a partner who was employed.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Pru defiant, others wary - Insurance
tax / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within minutes of Kenneth Clarke completing his Budget speech, the
Prudential issued a press release emphasising its 'determination' not to
pass the costs of a new 3 per cent insurance tax to customers.
Unfortunately for consumers, who have faced average rate increases of more
than 40 per cent on home and motor policies already, most of the Pru's
competitors will not be following suit.
The tax does not affect long-term life insurance (including endowments) or
pension policies. But it will be charged on most classes of policy which are
bought by individuals - such as home, motor and travel - and, on the whole,
it looks like bad news for the customer.
The Pru, which insures 2m householders, says it will absorb costs through
improvements in efficiency and Pearl Insurance will follow suit. 'I have
decided that our customers should not bear the cost,' said David Pye,
Pearl's general manager for general insurance.
Most companies seem certain to pass on the cost of the tax in higher prices,
however. The Association of British Insurers, which represents nearly all of
them, said the tax, which comes into effect next October, represents an
'additional burden for our policyholders.'
It added that the tax was 'the last thing we wanted at the present time
because the cost will need to be passed on to them.' And Mark Boleat,
director-general of the association, predicted the extra costs would amount
to about 35p a week for most customers.
'Somehow, the cost will have to be passed on to the policyholder. I can't
see how we can afford to absorb it,' said Mike Jones, head of public
relations for Sun Alliance, the largest insurer of homes in the UK.
Roy Randall, head of corporate relations at Royal Insurance, agreed: 'The
cost will have to be incorporated into premiums eventually.'
Legal &amp; General, the fourth-biggest home insurer in Britain, says companies
promising to protect their customers 'have not fully thought through the
implications, particularly to shareholders who have had very poor returns
from general insurance in recent years. Neither have they considered how
they will deal with potentially damaging tax increases in future.'
There are widespread fears also that the 3 per cent rate could be increased
in future years. Most European consumers pay higher premium taxes, with
rates ranging from 7 per cent in the Netherlands to 10 per cent in Germany
and up to 30 per cent on some French policies.
'This is the thin end of the wedge. When it comes to taxes, chancellors are
like starving men - they can never get enough,' said David Prosser, chief
executive of Legal and General.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: New issues rush to beat the deadline
 -Business expansion scheme / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With less than a month before the business expansion scheme is extinguished,
new issues are appearing with ever increasing urgency. Close Brothers has
launched a second issue of BESSA RBS for the Royal Bank of Scotland to raise
Pounds 20m. The BES will buy repossessed properties from the bank to be let
on assured tenancies. While the first issue, launched in September, offered
a fixed return of 120p for every 100p invested, the exit price on the second
issue is 125p after five years, equating to a net annual return of 14.3 per
cent for a higher-rate taxpayer.
Alternatively, investors can choose a 60p fixed return plus 2.6p for every 1
per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 index, subject to a maximum of 150p (FT-SE
growth of 34.6 per cent). There are lock-ins when the Footsie has grown by
enough to give a return of 125p and 150p.
RBS is providing a guaranteeing covenant and Best BES Advice, published by
the Allenbridge Group, says this represents 'excellent security.' Minimum
investment is Pounds 2,000 and investors can put money in both schemes.
Pilgrims Assured Homes, sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance and supported
by the Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association, aims to raise Pounds 5m to
provide subsidised accommodation for low-income families. The contracted
exit price of 128p equates to 14.3 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer (the
calculation of returns depend on a number of factors, such as when tax
relief can be claimed). Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
Foundation 30 is a new type of arranged exit scheme from Capital Ventures to
give investors returns over 30 years. The money is being raised for the
College of St Mark and St John in Devon, which is affiliated to the
University of Exeter. Investors will get tax relief on their initial
investment, and a return after five years of 35p for every 100p invested.
They will sell a fixed proportion of their remaining shares each year to get
an annual and rising tax-free return for the following 25. This is envisaged
at an initial 6.29p, increasing by 4 per cent a year.
BESt Investment, which analyses schemes, says the college should be able to
meet its buyback commitments given the ground rent and fees earned by the
college and says the scheme has merit for those about to retire or planning
school fees. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
Northern Counties Homemaker, sponsored by MMI, aims to provide newly-built
homes in Rochdale and Wakefield for those on local authority waiting lists.
MMI says the exit price of 124p equates to 14.6 per cent compound annual
growth after five years for a higher-rate taxpayer.
Schemes which do not have an arranged exit include the Glasgow Student
Village Companies, which will buy properties in Glasgow to let to students.
The scheme should pay a regular dividend based on the rental yield.
Cirencester Properties Four will buy properties to let on assured tenancies
in the West Country, while Luxury Family Homes, sponsored by MMI, will buy
hotels to cater for adults and children. Minimum investment in all three
schemes is Pounds 1,000.
Addington Equestrian Centre is to raise money to save the centre, based near
Buckingham. Directors include Lady Zinnia Judd and David Broome, the
showjumper. Minimum investment is Pounds 500.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Five-year shortfall for younger
women - Retirement pensions / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women under the age of 38 will have to work an extra five years until the
age of 65 before they can claim the state pension.
The Budget confirmed the government's intention to equalise state pension
ages at age 65. At present women can draw the pension at 60, whereas men
have to wait until 65. The change, which does not affect the pension rights
of women aged over 44, will be phased in over 10 years between 2010 and
2020. The pension age for women aged between 38 and 43 will depend on where
their birthday falls.
Younger women who still want to retire at age 60 may need to finance the
five-year shortfall in pension benefits. Jim Roberts, pension director at
Skandia Life, calculated that a 30-year-old woman would need to invest
immediately a single premium of Pounds 6,250 in a personal pension or a
company additional voluntary contribution scheme to achieve this.
Alternatively, payments of Pounds 45 per month over the next 30 years would
provide the same amount of extra pension.
The state pension comprises two elements - a flat rate benefit known as the
basic state pension (currently Pounds 56.10 per week for a single person and
Pounds 89.80 for a married couple) and a pension linked to earnings, known
as Serps (the State earnings related pension scheme). Eligibility for both
pensions depends on National Insurance contributions which are paid on 'band
earnings', that is earnings between Pounds 56 and Pounds 420 per week for
the current tax year (Pounds 57 and Pounds 430 per week in 1994/95).
Changes to the way Serps is calculated, due to take effect for those
retiring next century, will hit women since times of low earnings will be
taken into consideration and will drag down the value of the pension. Women,
who form 90 per cent of the part-time labour force, tend to spend long
periods in low-paid employment to fit in with family commitments.
To help offset the impact on women's pensions caused by the rise in pension
age and changes to Serps, the government has said that it will improve Home
Responsibility Protection (HRP) which is claimed by 'carers' (mostly women)
of young children and dependent relatives.
The number of years women will be able to claim HRP is to be increased from
19 to 22 while the benefit, which currently only builds up an entitlement to
the basic state pension, will be extended to cover Serps. The DSS said that
from 1999 onwards carers who have just 20 years of earnings on which they
have paid full rate National Insurance Contributions, will be entitled to a
full Serps pension. There will also be greater flexibility to defer the
state pension.
However, the phased reduction in the value of Serps from its original target
of 25 per cent of average band earnings to 20 per cent will still go ahead
after the year 2000.
Most European countries have already equalised their state pensions at age
65, or have announced plans to do so. But even before the latest changes
kick in, the UK provides one of the lowest pensions in the European Union.
The UK pension (basic and Serps combined) is worth a third of national
average earnings, compared with two thirds or more in France, Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg, Portugal, and Spain.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: A Pounds 1.5bn sweetener - Value
added tax / The Budget and You / The chancellor's compensation package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke and Peter Lilley, the Secretary of State for Social Security,
worked hard to try to calm the political storm over the imposition of value
added tax on domestic fuel.
While the chancellor did not reverse the change, as some people hoped, the
compensation package was more generous than expected. More than Pounds 1.5bn
of extra help will be provided over the next three years, in addition to the
effect which VAT on fuel (at 8 per cent in 1994-95 and 17.5 per cent in
1995-96) will have on benefits linked to the cost of living.
The package is designed to compensate all pensioners, widows and the
long-term sick. Those on income support will see their benefits uprated by
3.9 per cent, rather than the 3.5 per cent that would otherwise have been
the case.
Nevertheless, charities felt the chancellor had not been generous enough.
'The measures announced will not fully compensate those with high fuel
needs,' said Sally Greengross, director of Age Concern England. 'Fifty pence
for single pensioners is only a half to two-thirds of what they need to
compensate for VAT on fuel; 70p for couples is only around two-thirds of the
amount needed. it is also important to remember that, although gas prices
are coming down, the cost of electricity is rising.'
Scottish charities also warned that VAT on fuel would have a particularly
harsh effect on the elderly living north of the border where winter
temperatures are much lower than in most of England.
The following examples of how the benefits will work in practice have been
provided by the Department of Social Security:
A single pensioner not on
income-related benefits.
As from April 1994, the basic pension will rise from Pounds 56.10 to Pounds
57.60 a week. Of this Pounds 1.50 increase, 50p is extra money designed to
help with VAT on fuel. In April 1995, there will be a further 50p a week
help, and another 30p a week in April 1996.
A pensioner couple not on
income-related benefits.
The married couple's pension will increase from Pounds 89.80 to Pounds 92.10
a week in April 1994. Of this Pounds 2.30 a week rise, 70p is a supplement
intended to compensate for the fuel charge. In April 1995, couples will see
a further 70p a week in VAT-related increases, and another 45p a week in
April 1996.
A pensioner couple aged
between 60 and 74,
and on income support.
In April 1994, such couples' pensions will rise from Pounds 95.25 to Pounds
99.25 a week. Of this Pounds 4 increase, 70p is VAT-related. In April 1995
and April 1996, there will be further VAT-related rises of 70p and 60p a
week respectively.
A couple on income support
with two children under 11.
As from April 1994, the benefit for such couples will increase from Pounds
108.75 to Pounds 113.05 a week. Of the Pounds 4.30 a week improvement, 45p
is VAT-related. Further VAT-based rises of 55p a week and 70p a week will
occur in April 1995 and April 1996 respectively.
Clarke also announced an increase in cold weather payments from Pounds 6 to
Pounds 7 a week next winter, with a further 50p a week promised for the
following winter.
Funds for the home energy efficiency scheme, which provides grants towards
domestic insulation, will also be increased.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mr and Mrs Suburban: winners or
losers? - The effects on three different households / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN

<TEXT>
Two Budgets in one tax year create enough detail to confuse any taxpayer.
What makes matters even more complex is that both Norman Lamont and Kenneth
Clarke announced measures which would take effect in future tax years.
Our Budget 'At a Glance' box on page II guides investors through the
timetable of tax changes. But for the effect on individual taxpayers, the
Weekend FT asked Michael Bishopp and Clive Mackintosh of Price Waterhouse to
analyse how three different households will face different tax bills in
1994-95.
MR &amp; MRS SUBURBAN.
Mr Suburban has a salary of Pounds 30,000 and his wife earns Pounds 15,000.
He has an 1800cc company car, which cost Pounds 19,000 and he travels 5,000
business miles a year. They have a joint mortgage of Pounds 60,000 which
bears an interest rate of 7.5 per cent per annum. Following an inheritance,
they have investments of Pounds 80,000, yielding an annual gross income of
Pounds 3,800.
The Suburban couple are losers from the combined Lamont/Clarke Budgets on a
number of points. For a start, Mr Suburban who is a 40 per cent taxpayer,
gets the married couple's allowance. Relief on that allowance is being
restricted to 20 per cent from April 1994, reducing its value to Mr Suburban
from Pounds 688 to Pounds 344. In 1995-96, the allowance will be limited
further to 15 per cent, costing the Suburbans another Pounds 86 a year.
The couple will also pay a higher National Insurance Bill because of two
changes; the increase in the higher rate from 9 to 10 per cent announced by
Lamont; and the widening of the bands, from Pounds 56-Pounds 420 per week to
Pounds 57-Pounds 430 per week, announced by Clarke. The combined effect
costs Mr Suburban Pounds 232 and Mrs Suburban Pounds 112 in 1994-95.
The restriction of tax relief on mortgage interest to 20 per cent (another
Lamont measure) from April 1994 will cost the Suburbans Pounds 112 a year.
These changes offset one of the few positive tax moves - the widening of the
20 per cent tax band from Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000 - which will save the
couple Pounds 25 a year each.
Mr Suburban's company car is taxed more heavily in 1994-95 because of a
change in the tax system, introduced in Norman Lamont's last Budget. The new
system is based on the list price of the vehicle when new, rather than on a
combination of engine size and price as before. The change hits middle
managers like Mr Suburban, who made optimum use of the old system which
encouraged company car owners to own vehicles costing less than Pounds
19,250 and under 2,000cc.
All this means the taxable benefit of Mr Suburban's car will increase from
Pounds 2,990 to Pounds 4,433, pushing up his tax bill by Pounds 577.20.
The couple also see their fuel bill increase by Pounds 74, because of the
imposition of 8 per cent VAT, and, as they drink wine and smoke cigarettes,
their expenditure on alcohol and tobacco will rise by Pounds 28 a year. The
increase of 3p a litre on petrol increases their motoring costs by Pounds
113 a year.
Overall, the Suburbans are Pounds 1,542 worse off in 1994-95.
MR PENSIONER
Mr Pensioner is single, over 70 years old and receives a basic pension plus
SERPS, plus an occupational pension of Pounds 15 per week. He has neither
savings, nor mortgage and drinks beer.
After the Budget, his basic pension will rise from Pounds 56.10 to Pounds
57.60 per week in 1994-95; of that increase, 50p is due to the VAT
compensation package. Because he is a beer drinker, the Budget did not
increase Mr Pensioner's alcohol bill.
VAT on fuel, however, will increase the amount Mr Pensioner spends on
heating by Pounds 47.50 a year.
The changes appear to leave Mr Pensioner marginally better off, because the
rise in his pension is higher than the rise in his fuel bill. However, the
pension rise is, of course, designed to compensate pensioners for price
increases on other goods, such as food.
If one nets out that part of the pension increase which is solely due to VAT
on fuel - Pounds 26 a year - one can see that it does not compensate the
pensioner for the actual rise in the fuel bill of Pounds 47.50 a year.
MR &amp; MRS WEALTHY
The Lamont/Clarke Budgets have provided mixed news for the Wealthys. Mr
Wealthy earns Pounds 100,000 a year, has a company Porsche with a list price
of Pounds 30,000, in which he travels 10,000 business miles a year with fuel
provided. He has already invested Pounds 25,000 in Business Expansion
Schemes this tax year, which will earn him Pounds 10,000 in tax relief.
Mrs Wealthy earns Pounds 30,000 a year and has a company Toyota Celica, with
a list price of Pounds 20,000. No fuel is provided by the company; her
annual business mileage is 2,000 miles. the couple has a joint mortgage of
Pounds 60,000, at an interest rate of 7.5 per cent.
Mr Wealthy liked the safe, property-backed BES companies; he will not be
tempted by the more risky Enterprise Investment Scheme, due to start in
January. So, merely because of the end of the BES, he will pay a lot more
tax in 1994-95.
But if one ignores the BES, the Wealthys are, surprisingly, better off
because of this year's Budgets. This is because of their company cars.
In 1993-94, Mr Wealthy's car is taxed as part of the band worth more than
Pounds 29,001; the taxable benefit is Pounds 10,400. For 1994-95, the
taxable benefit is based on 35 per cent of the price of the Porsche (Pounds
30,000), with a one-third reduction because his mileage is between 2,500 and
18,000. The taxable benefit falls by Pounds 3,040; his gain is 40 per cent
of that, or Pounds 1,216.
Mrs Wealthy also gains from the differing tax treatment of company cars. In
1993-94, her taxable benefit was Pounds 6,210, plus a 50 per cent increase
because she drove less than 2,500 business miles, making the total Pounds
9,315. For 1994-95, the benefit is the cost of the car (Pounds 20,000)
multiplied by 0.35, or Pounds 7,000. Her benefit falls by Pounds 2,315; her
gain is 40 per cent or Pounds 926.
So even though the Wealthys suffer from a higher National insurance bill, a
higher fuel bill and from reduced tax relief on their mortgages and on the
married couple's allowance, the effect of this year's Budgets is to leave
them better off by around Pounds 1,224.
The examples show that averages can be a misleading way of judging the
effects of Budgets, because of the complex nature of each family's
circumstances.
Even though analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that the
Budgets have had the greatest impact on the richest 10 per cent of the
population, much depends on technical factors such as company cars and BES
investments.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Deeper in debt - Student loans / The
Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Students will have to borrow more heavily to get through university - a
consequence of the sharp rise in their numbers. The chancellor asked: 'Why
should the bus driver or the pensioner pay higher taxes to finance the
living costs of tomorrow's lawyers?'
Grants, frozen in 1990 when student loans were introduced, will be cut by 10
per cent next year and by similar amounts for the next two years. Instead,
the money available through the Student Loans Company will rise so the total
funds available to students will rise by 4 per cent.
For the 1994-95 academic year, the loan limit from the SLC will increase to
Pounds 1,375 for students in London, Pounds 1,150 for those elsewhere and
Pounds 915 for those living at home. The maximum maintenance grant for
students in London will fall from Pounds 2,845 to Pounds 2,561.
If the process of cutting the grant and increasing the loan continues as
planned, by the beginning of the academic year in September 1996, the
proportion of grant and loan for a student's living expenses will be roughly
equal. The chancellor also cut the amount paid to universities for students'
tuition, which may prompt some institutions to introduce tuition fees.
The National Union of Students said the full grant and loan are often not
enough to live on, obliging many students to borrow from a bank or parents
instead. A Barclays survey found the average student had debts of about
Pounds 1,670.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Granny returns - Guaranteed Income
Bonds / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'Granny Bond' is set to return in the form of a new fixed interest
National Savings vehicle aimed at those over 65.
The National Savings Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond will pay a fixed
monthly income, guaranteed for five years. It will only be available to
those aged 65 and over. Interest will be paid gross.
The bond will be launched in the new year and full details will be available
nearer the time. National Savings says pensioners will be offered 'a decent,
fixed rate of return that is within the structure of National Savings and
market interest rates prevailing at the time of launch.'
It will be interesting to see exactly how competitive the government intends
to be. In 1992, the launch of the fixed rate First Option Bond attracted so
much money from savers that building societies howled in protest. National
Savings promptly dropped the rates paid on the bond.
Lower interest rates mean that building societies are having even greater
difficulty attracting savings than in 1992. But the government needs a solid
contribution from National Savings to help finance its deficit.
One must also question whether the new bond will be quite the boon that
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has implied. As Clarke said, interest rates
are lower than they have been for a generation; locking away your money at
current rates for five years may not be a sensible option.
The original Granny Bonds were index-linked National Savings certificates,
which increased in value in line with inflation (these are still, of course,
on sale but are available to investors of any age).

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead - Glued to Granada /
The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the circumstances, the full-year results of Granada Group, the
leisure, television and computer services concern, are bound to be
interesting on Wednesday.
Of course the City is keen to find out whether Gerry Robinson, the chief
executive who produced a 129 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
130m last time can once again work a little magic.
There is also the question of how well the Pounds 360m acquisition of
Sutcliffe, the contract caterer, is doing under the leadership of a man who
came from Compass, the catering group.
Analysts are saying Granada and Robinson performed perfectly decently in the
year to September and are looking for pre-tax figures, including the
contribution from Sutcliffe, of around Pounds 165m. On this occasion,
however all minds will be concentrating not on the dividend or the
prospective p/e, but on when Granada is going down the takeover trail blazed
by Carlton Communications last week in its agreed bid for Central.
With high operational gearing in its glass-making business, forecasting
profits from Pilkington is difficult and there is a wide range of estimates
for pre-tax profits for the six months to end September to be reported on
Thursday. Compared to Pounds 15.1m last year, forecasts are from a small
increase to a doubling of profits. It is a question of how much better
profits in the UK and US will be offset by continuing declines in Europe.
Pilkington is expected to rebalance its dividend having cut two finals
without a reduction in the interim, but the assumption is that the total for
the year will be unchanged.
Airtours, the holiday group, announces full-year results on Monday, with
pre-tax profits expected to be about Pounds 45m, compared with last year's
Pounds 36.5m. This year's figure is after Pounds 9m spent on the failed
attempt earlier this year to take over rival Owners Abroad.
Interest will focus on booking levels for this winter and next summer and
the effect, if any, of the new airport departure tax. The group will also be
questioned on progress on integrating newly-acquired travel chains,
Pickfords and Hogg Robinso.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Revenue gears for change -
Do-it-yourself tax / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wheels are grinding slowly into action at the Inland Revenue in
preparation for the move towards do-it-yourself tax returns.
In his Budget speech, Kenneth Clarke confirmed that next year's finance bill
will contain much of the legislation needed for the new system. It means
that around 9m taxpayers - all those who now receive tax returns, about half
of whom are the self-employed - will be able to assess their own tax
liabilities or refunds and send the money directly to the Revenue. There
will be no obligation to use the new system, though. The Revenue will still
receive tax returns and calculate the liability, but will require earlier
submission.
While self-assessment will not operate fully until after the 1996-97 tax
year, some self-employed people will start to be affected from next year.
Anyone who creates a business after April 5 1994 will be taxed on a
current-year basis, in contrast to the preceding-year basis now in force.
Others who are operating businesses already will continue to pay on a
preceding-year basis for the next two years, but will then begin to be
involved in transitional arrangements.
For the 1996-97 year, tax returns will have to be submitted by September 30
1997 if the Revenue is to assess the liability; or by January 31 1998 if the
taxpayer decides to calculate it.
After the transition year, taxpayers will pay up to half of their estimated
tax for the current tax year at the end of each January, and an estimate for
the remainder of the year at the end of July. Any adjustments for the final
payment will be made in the following January.
Those who fail to complete their returns by these dates will be liable to a
one-off fine - probably Pounds 100 - as well as interest.
Further details of the new scheme will be introduced in the 1995 finance
act. Issues still to be determined include the design of the new tax return
and the role of employers in the new arrangements.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Freeze that will squeeze - Taxation
/ The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor effectively increased taxes by freezing most allowances in
this week's Budget. The personal allowance, the higher-rate band, the
capital gains tax and inheritance tax thresholds - all will be left at their
1993-94 levels.
The impact of inflation on wages means that if allowances are unchanged,
more people are drawn into the tax net, or the higher rate bands, with each
succeeding year. The Rooker-Wise amendment in the 1970s tried to build
index-linking into the tax system, but recent chancellors have felt free to
ignore it.
Not uprating the personal allowance in 1994-95 will cost 20 per cent
taxpayers Pounds 14 a year, and basic-rate taxpayers Pounds 17.50 a year.
Failing to uprate the personal allowance and the higher-rate band will cost
top-rate taxpayers Pounds 103 a year.
There were a few allowances which escaped the Budget freeze. The blind
person's allowance will rise in April 1994 from Pounds 1,080 to Pounds
1,200, having been frozen for the past four tax years.
The earnings cap - the maximum level of earnings for which pensions
provision may be made with tax relief - will rise from Pounds 75,000 to
Pounds 76,800 in April 1994.
In addition, the 20 per cent income tax band will increase from Pounds 2,500
to Pounds 3,000 in the tax year 1994-95, a measure already trailed in Norman
Lamont's March Budget. But it saves taxpayers a maximum of only Pounds 25 a
year.
Another hangover from the Lamont era is the increase in employee national
insurance contributions from 9 to 10 per cent. The band on which this rate
applies has been increased - from Pounds 56 to Pounds 57 at the lower end,
and from Pounds 420 to Pounds 430 at the upper. The combined effect of the
changes will mean that anyone earning more than Pounds 22,360 will be Pounds
237 a year worse off.
One reform which some predicted - the restriction of tax relief on the
personal allowance to 20 per cent - did not occur. But relief on the married
couple's allowance (still frozen at Pounds 1,720) had been restricted
already to 20 per cent, from April 1994; it will be restricted further to 15
per cent from April 1995. The changes will cost a basic-rate taxpaying
couple Pounds 86 in 1994-95 and a further Pounds 86 in 1995-96; higher-rate
couples will lose Pounds 344 in 1994-95 and a further Pounds 86 in 1995-96.
Couples aged between 65 and 74, while affected adversely by the above
restrictions, will see their allowances rise from Pounds 2,465 to Pounds
2,665 in 1994-95; the allowance for those aged over 75 will increase from
Pounds 2,505 to Pounds 2,705. Each allowance will rise by a further Pounds
330 in 1995-96. The income limit for age-related allowances, however, stays
at Pounds 14,200.
Income tax rates were unchanged. So, for single people in 1994-95, there
will be no tax payable on the first Pounds 3,445 20 per cent on the next
Pounds 3,000, 25 per cent on the next Pounds 20,700, and 40 per cent above
that. The CGT threshold for 1994-95 will be Pounds 5,800 and IHT Pounds
150,000.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance in the Family: Borrowers pay more - Mortgages / The
Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies generally were relieved that Tuesday's Budget eroded
rather than killed mortgage tax relief.
On top of the cut in Miras (mortgage interest relief at source) from 25 to
20 per cent in April 1994, chancellor Kenneth Clarke announced a further
reduction to 15 per cent from April 1995. Each change is expected to cost
borrowers Pounds 10 a month on a mortgage of Pounds 30,000 or more.
Home income plans will not, however, be affected by the lowering of tax
relief on mortgage interest. The Treasury made clear that tax relief on
interest paid to allow elderly people to buy life annuities will continue to
be available at 25 per cent.
Lenders are not rushing to pass on the pre-Budget base rate cut to
borrowers. Lloyds bank has announced a cut in its standard rate from January
for existing borrowers, taking it to 7.74 per cent from 7.99 per cent.
The lead in announcing mortgage rate cuts was taken by the Nationwide
building society and National Westminster bank, which said on the day of the
base rate reduction that they would cut their standard variable rate to 7.74
per cent from 7.99.
Nationwide added that the reduction meant a saving of Pounds 6.67 a month
for those borrowers with a repayment mortgage of Pounds 50 000.
Their move was followed later that week by announcements from the National &amp;
Provincial, Newcastle and Northern Rock.
The latter moved in expectation of a further small base rate cut, dropping
its base rate for new loans to 7.65 per cent from 7.99.
But others such as the Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest society, are
intending to wait for a further reduction before making any changes. Other
lenders are likely to move between now and the new year, when new rates
announced already will apply to existing borrowers.
A further reason for caution in moving on variable rates, however, could be
the societies' desire to know more about the government's plans for the new
guaranteed income bond for people over 65 before deciding what rates they
can offer, to savers as well as to borrowers.
Even if some variable rates do not change in this period, new ranges of
fixed-rate mortgages are likely to become available.
Abbey National, the UK's second largest mortgage lender, yesterday launched
a new range of fixed-rate loans for first-time buyers and other customers.
Rates for the latter vary between 6.39 per cent (apr 6.7) until April 1996
to 7.89 per cent (apr 8.3) to April 2001. Booking fees are Pounds 50-Pounds
300; redemption penalties range from 60 to 210 days' interest.
The loans are available with any repayment method and Abbey does not insist
that customers take out compulsory insurance.
Bradford &amp; Bingley building society is offering a rate of 6.45 per cent (apr
6.7), fixed until end-January 1997, for those wanting to move or
re-mortgage.
The booking fee is Pounds 250, or 0.25 per cent for loans over Pounds
100,000, and no conditional purchases are required.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets: Doomed BES has twins - The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People hoping that chancellor Kenneth Clarke would say something about a
'son of the business expansion scheme' - due to be abolished at the end of
the year - will be pleased that the BES has spawned twins, writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
One is somewhat premature, since only sketchy details of 'a new type of
investment trust called a venture capital trust, to invest in unquoted
companies,' have been revealed. It will pay dividends free of income tax and
gains will not be subject to capital gains tax.
This makes it similar to a personal equity plan, but other details will be
worked out only after Clarke issues a consultation paper in the new year.
The earliest legislation would be in the 1995 Finance Bill.
By contrast, the enterprise investment scheme (EIS) for new investment in
qualifying unquoted companies is to come into effect from January 1; but
since the legislation for it will not be in place until several months
later, it is likely to get off to only a slow start. The main features are:
Income tax relief at 20 per cent (instead of at the taxpayer's marginal rate
under the BES), and full CGT exemption.
Full tax relief for losses made on the sale of shares.
Investors can become paid directors.
Maximum investment raised from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 100,000.
Investment in private rented housing will not qualify for relief. Shares
must be held for five years.
Carryback relief is Pounds 15,000, instead of Pounds 5,000 as under the BES.
Companies are limited to raising Pounds 1m, instead of the BES's Pounds 5m
(apart from shipping companies, which are allowed Pounds 5m).
Qualifying companies must have traded in the UK for three years but do not
have to be incorporated or resident there.
Ian Pugh of the Allenbridge Group, a BES analyst, said: 'It's taking the BES
back to its original intention as venture capital for small businesses.
'It is less attractive than the BES because it is less secure; and there is
less scope for tax arbitrage since the front-end tax relief has been reduced
from 40p in the pound to 20p. However, the CGT and income tax relief on loss
can be exploited.'
Charles Fry of Johnson Fry, a BES sponsor which invented the successul
'loan-back' scheme, said the task would be to come up with packages
attractive to investors combining the CGT roll-over provision extended by
Clarke to all investors (see main article on this page). Investors would
still have to pay CGT on their original gain.
John Snelgrove, partner for private client services at accountant BDO Binder
Hamlyn, added: 'We are back to the original BES scheme except that an
investor can become a paid director.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Unpleasant ingredient - Capital gains
tax / The Budget and You / The move to end indexation for CGT losses will be
very unpopular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budgets are expected to throw up some unpleasant surprises, but the decision
to end the use of indexation for capital gains tax losses will be
particularly unpopular. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke included the measure among
the tax 'loopholes' rattled off at great speed in his speech.
Investors will now be able to use indexation only to reduce gains but not to
create losses; since Tuesday, only nominal losses (ie, when the price of the
asset has fallen) can be offset against gains.
'It's a fundamental change in the law and not a loophole,' said David
Rothenberg of chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg. 'It will affect all
those people with assets which have not increased in value since 1982. The
approach of hiding it under the guise of anti-avoidance is underhand.'
CGT is payable when you make gains on the disposal of most assets but there
is an annual exemption of Pounds 5,800. (The annual exemption was not raised
in either of this year's two Budgets). An investor must pay tax at his
marginal rate on gains above this amount.
In 1982, an indexation allowance, based on the retail prices index, was
introduced so that nominal gains achieved because of inflation were not
taxed. The Inland Revenue releases the indexation factors, and the Weekend
FT publishes a table every month explaining how to calculate your CGT bill
based on these figures.
Former chancellor Nigel Lawson decided to make a number of changes to CGT in
his 1985 Budget, to 'produce a fairer tax' and 'make life simpler for the
taxpayer.' One of these was to extend indexation to losses, so that a
nominal capital gain would be treated as a real capital loss and the value
of a nominal capital loss could be increased to reflect the real loss and to
be offset against other gains.
Clarke has now reversed Lawson's change, with immediate effect. It
complicates what was already a complex tax.
Maurice Parry-Wingfield of chartered accountant Touche Ross, said: 'Once
people realise what he's done, they are going to be extremely upset - think
of all those people whose investments have gone down the drain.
'CGT was hell already. Now we're back to 1982-85, with all the unscrambling
of history to do. Clarke is restoring all the anomalies, and it will make
the calculations very complicated.'
What is the effect
on the investor?
Ignoring the situation before April 6 1982 - when indexation was introduced
 -and assuming that November's RPI is the same as October's (141.8),
Parry-Wingfield offers the following examples of how the change now affects
those with assets subject to CGT.
Suppose that you bought shares in April 1982 (after the 5th) for Pounds
10,000 and sold them last month for Pounds 1,000. If you sold them before
Budget day, your allowable loss, using the indexation table published in
last week's paper, would be Pounds 16,500. This is because the proceeds of
Pounds 1,000 are deducted from the indexed cost of Pounds 17,500 (Pounds
10,000 x 1.75).
If, however, you sold them on Budget day, your allowable loss would have
been only Pounds 9,000 because the Pounds 1,000 proceeds would be deducted
from the unindexed cost of Pounds 10,000.
What about transfers
between husband and wife?
At first sight, it might appear that husbands and wives can get around this
rule by transferring loss-making shares to one another. Transfers between
spouses are on a 'no gain/no loss basis,' which simply means that there is
no immediate tax effect.
Since the spouse is treated for CGT purposes as having acquired the shares
at their original cost plus indexation up to the date of transfer, some
married couples could think that, by transferring loss-making shares to each
other before selling them, they can preserve the indexation.
The Inland Revenue is going to prevent this, though, by introducing 'special
rules' so that the indexation applying to the cost of an asset transferred
between spouses on or after Tuesday can be used only for gains, not losses.
Nevertheless, the indexation incorporated in the last transfer of shares
between spouses before Budget day will not be affected and will still be
available to create or increase a loss. This would appear to lead to some
curious scenarios.
Suppose your spouse bought shares for Pounds 10,000 in April 1982 and
transferred half of them to you in September 1991. The price of the shares
kept falling and, by chance, you both decided to sell on Budget day,
obtaining only Pounds 500 each.
Your spouse is caught out completely by Clarke's measure, in the same way as
the investor in the above example. Your spouse's allowable loss is only
Pounds 4,500 (50 per cent of Pounds 10,000 minus the Pounds 500 proceeds).
But the effect for CGT purposes on your sale is completely different. The
indexation factor for April 82-September 91 is 1.661, so the indexed cost
would be Pounds 8,305 (Pounds 5,000 x 1.661). Subtracting the Pounds 500
proceeds from this figure leaves you with Pounds 7,805 of allowable losses.
The Treasury says it expects the indexation restriction to raise Pounds 50m
in 1994-95, rising more sharply to about Pounds 300m in 1996-97 - which,
according to Parry-Wingfield amounts to a forecast of what losses people
will make. Rothenberg added: 'Farmers will be major losers from the
legislation because of the fall in value of agricultural land since 1982.
'People with assets which have not gone up, including a second home,
loss-making shares and failed businesses, will all be affected. These are
people who expected to have allowable losses which they now will not have.'
CGT re-investment relief
Although many people will be affected by the CGT restriction, fewer are
likely to benefit from a CGT concession handed out by Clarke. This extends
the CGT roll-over relief, introduced in the March budget for entrepreneurs
selling their own company and re-investing in an unquoted trading company,
to any individual.
The aim is to encourage people to invest in small businesses by holding out
the carrot of deferring a CGT bill. But the type of unquoted trading
companies into which investors could roll over their CGT liability is
limited - excluded are those which hold more than 50 per cent of their
chargeable assets in land, as well as most financial companies and
subsidiaries. So investors are confined to the riskier end of the market.
As long as the shareholder does not emigrate within three years of buying
the new shares, he can defer the CGT bill on their original gain. 'It's
bound to attract a lot of interest as long as the investment is not too
risky,' said Caroline Garnham, tax and trusts specialist at solicitor
Simmons and Simmons. 'The fact that there is no clawback after three years
gives scope for planning.'
Rothenberg said, however, that investors in quoted companies could sell
easily because of their liquidity while the market for unquoted shares was
less liquid.
'In practice, few people will want to sell and re-invest to postpone CGT,
but the roll-over relief does give an opportunity to shelter a proportion of
the gain,' he added.
Andrew Jones, of accountant Ernst &amp; Young, agreed. 'Unquoted companies are
not readily marketable, so it's not taken for granted that people would want
to roll over CGT relief. I think the impact will be marginal.'
Another positive CGT measure announced by Clarke was raising the limit on
the amount of relief from CGT when a person sells a business (or some other
assets) on retirement, provided they are 55 or over. Relief is now available
on the first Pounds 250,000 (instead of Pounds 150,000) of gains, and half
relief is given on gains between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1m (previously
between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 600,000). The exemption is reduced for
those running the business for less than 10 years.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets: Markets toast the chancellor's health - The
reaction in London / The Budget and You
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON

Fancy that. Not only did chancellor Kenneth Clarke leave beer well alone in
his first Budget, but when it was over you could still think of him as the
kind of chap to spend an evening with in the pub.
Our Ken may be a bit pugnacious but underneath that bluff exterior ticks the
decent heart of a man prepared to buy a round of doubles for the old folk to
keep them warm in winter. The trouble is that just when the evening draws to
close in a merry haze, you know he's going to turn round and say: 'It's on
you.'
At the outset both the gilts and the equity market loved the Budget. The
FT-SE 100, which had already risen 31 points on Tuesday, surged another 66
on Wednesday. Admittedly the movement slackened after that, but the net gain
of 68 points over the last three trading days of the week was striking
compared with the advance of only 15 points that followed Lord Lawson's
give-away Budget in 1988.
Similarly gilts advanced about three points over Tuesday and Wednesday
though the gains tapered towards the end of the week, partly reflecting
caution ahead of next week's auction. That apart, there are plenty of
reasons why the glow should last longer in the gilts market than for
equities.
Not only did Clarke announce that Pounds 7bn of gilts already sold to banks
and building societies would count towards next year's funding. He took
another Pounds 5.5bn in tax increases and spending cuts out of the PSBR for
next year on top of the Pounds 6.7bn already pencilled in by Norman Lamont.
He promised a balanced budget by the end of the decade, which may stretch
credibility a bit but is better than having no such target. And he forecast
that underlying inflation would not exceed the government's 4 per cent
ceiling next year.
So long as the spending controls work, this adds up to a recipe for lower
gilt yields. Inflation will continue to be squeezed and the government's
demands on the gilts market should fall below Pounds 30bn in 1994-95
compared with around Pounds 50bn this year.
What is good for bonds, though, is not necessarily the same for equities. So
far the equity market seems blithely prepared to ignore the moment when the
bills start to come in. The squeeze on consumer demand will become ever
tighter after April. Clarke's economic growth forecast of 2.5 per cent may
only work if the savings rate falls sharply and that is unlikely unless
confidence revives. While the chancellor won plaudits from the City for
fiscal rectitude and from Tory back benchers for restoring the government's
grip, it was easy to forget that this year's two Budgets will take some
Pounds 750 away from households earning Pounds 30,000.
There is some consolation for the equity market. Lower inflation and lower
long-term interest rates make p/e multiples and yield valuations acceptable
that would have been unthinkable a few years ago, as the yield-gap chart on
this page shows. Besides, if fiscal austerity really does cause the recovery
to falter, Clarke can always ring Eddie George at the Bank and tell him
that, while the timing is of course now up to him, it would be a good moment
to cut interest rates. That would help gilts and equities by prompting
another big flow from bank and building society deposits.
The cosy theory that a strong gilt market should underpin equities depends,
though, on gilts actually responding to the chancellor's treatment. There is
room for doubt in both a domestic and an international context. The gilt
market has much more grounds for worry about whether the chancellor will
stick to his spending plans. If he does not, its PSBR estimates are thrown
out of gear, but equities would benefit because fiscal policy is not quite
as tight as previously assumed.
Moreover ten-year gilts are already trading at an unusually narrow spread of
66 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) over US Treasury issues
and 71 basis points over German bunds. Until the chancellor's credibility on
spending is established with overseas investors gilts market trends will
depend heavily on what happens in other markets. The sporadic nervousness in
the New York bond market is food for thought.
For the time being it looks as though foreign investors still like the UK.
The strength of sterling, above DM2.56 yesterday afternoon, bears this out.
Shorn of foreign support which seems prepared to defy most rational
criteria, though, the equity market could look a sorry sight. As striking as
Tuesday's Budget was a string of disappointing results.
On Wednesday the General Electric Company warned that its profits this year
would show little improvement over 1992 because of higher development
spending on defence projects and poor markets for products like cables. At
least Lord Weinstock will not even have to pay 1p a share for Ferranti's
assets now, but it would help if he could find some useful way of investing
that ever-mounting cash pile. GEC shares fell 13p to 324p on the week.
Argyll also chose Wednesday to report that its profits would be reduced by
about Pounds 40m this year because of a decision to write down its stores.
The announcement overshadowed a 6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits and raised worries about other food retailers who will come under
increased pressure to do the same. Argyll fell 8p to 255p on the week.
On Thursday it was Hanson's turn. Its full year profits fell to Pounds
1.02bn from Pounds 1.29bn, the dividend was held and it warned of higher
interest charges as its wheeze of borrowing in dollars and investing spare
cash in sterling has become much less lucrative. It is also to float its
housebuilding units to raise possibly as much as Pounds 500m. All that was
worth a fall of 12 1/2 p to 266p.
Ladbroke baffled everybody. On Tuesday it disclosed that Michael Hirst, a
senior director who runs its hotel division, had sold just over half his
holding. On Thursday the company announced that the sale was, however,
unconnected by amicable discussions it was having with Hirst about his
future. On Wednesday it also said it would pay a foreign income dividend,
which institutions dislike because they cannot reclaim a tax credit.
Yesterday Ladbroke began to backtrack, but the odds on this adding up to
good news have lengthened. The shares fell 17p to 145p.
But it was not all gloom on the corporate front. Carlton Communications
leapt 57p to 834p after Monday's agreed Pounds 624m bid for Central
Independent television.
Royal Bank of Scotland stole the show on Thursday with a surge in full-year
profits from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 265.2m and a 25 per cent increase in its
dividend. It rose 46p to 384p on the week.
That underlines the attraction - in times of weak growth and low interest
rates - of companies with secure and rising dividends. Other banks like
Lloyds might benefit too. So would those ailing supermarkets if only they
would cut their store opening programmes and pay surplus cash to
shareholders instead.

If Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget was remarkable for one thing, it was
what he did not do rather than what he did. Seldom have the stock market
pundits been so wrong in their predictions of gloom.
Aside from the general euphoria with which the market greeted the Budget, a
number of stock market sectors have rebounded in relief that the worst did
not happen. Others have risen as the Budget raised expectations that
interest rates and inflation would be lower than had been thought.
Ideas like that - plus good profit figures from Royal Bank of Scotland  -
have made the banks some of the best performers this week.
In the relief category must come sectors such as building materials and
contracting and construction. While cut backs in spending - such as on the
roads programme - and the creeping abolition of mortgage interest relief
might appear bad news, the measures the chancellor ended up taking were by
no means as bad as analysts had feared.
Housebuilders could even take heart from the suggestion of more social
housing being built. Companies such as BICC were buoyed by news that the
West Coast line refurbishment will go ahead, as will the Docklands Light
Railway extension.
Another big concern had been the threat that tax-exempt investors, such as
pension funds, might lose their tax credits on dividends. Clarke did not
take up that suggestion which was good news for the life insurance
companies, which manage a lot of tax-exempt money.
It was good too for higher yielding stocks, especially those where dividends
are secure and expected to rise. Utilities such as electricity and water
stocks have been particular winners since the Budget.
Another non-story as it turned out - though Clarke kept everyone guessing
till the last moment with a rather theatrical performance - was the
extension of VAT to more categories of goods.
The lack of the widely-expected VAT on books and newspapers has boosted the
media companies, like Reed, EMAP, Daily Mail, Mirror Group Newspapers and
The Telegraph. Also retailers such as WH Smith, J Menzies and Pentos were
gainers.
Similarly, the chancellor's decision not to put VAT on food or children's
clothes, as many thought he would, helped some stores groups. However, the
benefit food retailers might have expected to see in their share prices has
been more than wiped out by Argyll's decision on Wednesday to start
depreciating its shops which unsettled the whole sector.
One of the best performing sectors, brewers and distillers, was another
beneficiary of the chancellor not doing something, in this case putting up
duties on most alcoholic drinks. The British have become so accustomed to a
few pence on a pint at every Budget that it was a real shock when it did not
happen.
Even the bad news was not too bad. An area to which a new tax was extended,
but in a very small way, was the imposition of a 3 per cent tax on general
insurance premiums.
This might hit the composite insurance groups, and if the companies find
themselves forced to absorb the tax it could add up to a substantial cut in
profits - after all the tax is intended to raise Pounds 750m in a full year.
But after hefty premium increases in recent years, the companies may be able
to pass on the tax quietly to policyholders inured to rises.
Likewise, airport departure duties of Pounds 5 and Pounds 10 depending on
destination, which will not come into effect until October next year anyway,
are unlikely to make much difference to the price of package holidays, or to
the profits of the likes of British Airways or BAA.
The big sector losers since the Budget have largely been those affected by
other issues - like the food retailers. The electronics sector has been hit
by poor trading news from GEC and Racal, while a sharp fall in profits at
Hanson dragged down the conglomerates sector.
The sectors which have moved immediately on the Budget may not be those
which do well or badly over the next 12 months. But it is much harder at
this stage to predict which will be next year's winners.
Hopes of a continuing consumer-led recovery suggest consumer sectors should
do well. Interest rate sensitive sectors should also outperform if the new
expectation of base rates coming down further and staying down longer proves
correct.

Kenneth Clarke's Budget may have gained the thumbs up from the gilt and
equity markets, but on one important criterion, it deserves the thumbs down.
Simplicity is an important part of the tax system, and is not just of
academic interest. When chancellors add layers of complexity, taxpayers have
to devote more time to coping with the rules. Investors' decisions become
determined not by the nature of the investment, but by the nature of the tax
rules which apply to it.
It is much easier for individuals to plan their finances if the tax system
is governed by consistent principles. If government changes to the tax rules
are arbitrary, confusion results.
Nigel Lawson's reform made large strides in the direction of simplification;
by the end of his chancellorship, for example, we had just two rates of
income tax, 25 and 40 per cent. His three successors - Major, Lamont and now
Clarke - have tinkered with the rules to make matters worse.
Let us start with tax reliefs. There was logic in limiting all reliefs to
the 20 per cent rate of tax. This appeared to be the direction in which the
government was heading in the last Budget when it reduced three items to 20
per cent; the tax credit on dividends, mortgage interest relief and the
married couple's allowance.
Now, we have an additional 15 per cent band at which reliefs will apply from
April 1995; on Miras and on the married couple's allowance. There is no 15
per cent income tax band, so this new relief does not fit the system. It
means there will be four rates on which tax reliefs will apply - 15, 20, 25
and 40 per cent.
An alternative approach would have been to reduce the amount of the married
couple's allowance from Pounds 1,720 and to limit the size of loan on which
mortgage interest relief was granted to, say, Pounds 25,000.
The Treasury argues, however, that reducing the loan limit would have the
greatest effect on those with the biggest mortgages. Reducing it to 15 per
cent spreads the pain. Once a 15 per cent relief had been established for
Miras, then it was logical to apply it to the married couple's allowance.
Again, there appears to be a contradiction. It might seem the Treasury's
clear intention to phase out the married couple's allowance, as an
anachronism in an age of independent assessment of men and women. However,
the Treasury is increasing the married couple's allowance for those over 65
in each of the next two years. So is the married couple's allowance going or
not?
Then we have the changes to capital gains tax. The old system of CGT was
fairly complex, but it at least had some kind of inner logic; investors
should not pay tax on gains which merely represented compensation for
inflation.
The new system, explained by Scheherazade Daneshkhu on Page III, means
indexation cannot be used to create losses. So if you invest Pounds 10,000
and, after five years, prices have doubled, you will not have a CGT loss of
Pounds 10,000 to offset against gains elsewhere. If you make a nominal loss
of Pounds 10,000, however (which would, in our example, mean the company
going bust) you will still be able to offset that against other gains.
What seems particularly arbitrary and unfair is that the change applied
immediately from Budget day. Investors will have based their planning on the
rules applying at the start of the tax year. If, for example, they had
already made gains of over Pounds 5,800, they might have planned to sell
loss-making investments (under the old rules) to eliminate their tax
liability. As one reader has written: 'The goal posts have been moved in the
middle of the match.'
Then we have the 'son of BES'. The Business Expansion Scheme will be
abolished from the end of this year. It has had a chequered history. It was
designed to encourage investment in small businesses; unfortunately, many of
the businesses failed. Then it was turned into a scheme for encouraging
private rented property and ingenious sponsors devised ways of making it a
rewarding tax break.
BES is being replaced with the Enterprise Investment Scheme, designed to
encourage investment in small businesses. Private rented property is
excluded. The rules are slightly different; relief is limited to 20 per
cent, the amount which can be invested has increased from Pounds 40,000 to
Pounds 100,000, and paid directors will qualify for relief. Nevertheless, we
appear to be going around in circles.
One lesson is to beware of Budget predictions. Full tax relief on personal
pensions is still in place, the BES was not abolished one month early;
investors were therefore wise to ignore the 'buy now while stocks last'
pre-Budget hype. Decisions can now be taken in a calmer environment,
although not, alas, in a simpler tax regime.

<TEXT>
Any doubts equity investors may have had about the strength of the US
recovery should have been dispelled this week by what was probably the most
positive batch of economic data seen since the end of the recession. In
successive days, there was good news on consumer confidence, nation-wide
manufacturing activity, personal income and consumption, and leading
economic indicators.
Most important of all, the latest jobs data was very bullish. Government
figures released yesterday showed that non-farm payrolls rose 208,000 in
November (analysts had predicted a rise of around 140,000), and that the
national unemployment rate dropped from 6.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent. cent).
Admittedly, there was some bad news - home sales fell and store sales were
disappointing in November - but it was not enough to dent hopes that theUS
economy could record growth of more than 4 per cent in the final quarter of
this year, up from below 3 per cent in the previous three months.
Aside from the positive economic data, analysts will also have to start
factoring into their forecasts the impact on growth of the latest declines
in oil prices. This week, the price of a barrel of oil fell to Dollars
14.95, the lowest it has been in more than five years. The decline - which
stemmed from last week's failure of oil exporting countries to agree on
production cuts - may have rattled oil stocks, which have dropped sharply in
recent days, but it should help the industrial and transport sectors.
One might think that all this good news would have provided a strong fillip
to share prices this week. Think again. Stocks did rise over the five days,
but not by much. From the opening on Monday to mid-morning yesterday, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained only 17 points, or less than half a
per cent, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (a broader measure of share price
performance) had barely moved at all.
The apparent lack of enthusiasm among investors about the economy has its
roots in two factors. First, share prices are close to their record highs
and stocks remain expensive in terms of company earnings, so investors are
wary about pushing equities any higher. The Dow seems to have found a
short-term ceiling around 3,700, and it is probably a question now of
waiting for corporate profits to catch up with share valuations before
stocks look worth buying again.
Second, concern about the outlook for interest rates continues to nag at
investors. Bond prices may have stabilised this week, with the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond seemingly stuck between 6.2 per cent and 6.3 per
cent, but investors appear convinced that long-term interest rates are only
going to go higher, not lower, during the next six months to a year.
If interest rates do rise steadily over the next 12 months, the flow of
investors' money into equities, which has been the single biggest factor
driving prices higher over the past two and a half years, could begin to
slow.
Although interest rates have been edging higher for little more than a
month, an executive at Fidelity Investments, the largest US mutual fund
group, noted earlier this week that some of the firm's clients had been
favouring short-term money market funds over stock and bond funds in recent
weeks. It is premature to sound the alarm about money flows, however.
Money-market funds now return a miserly 2.5 per cent and it would take a big
fall in stock and bond prices, and/or a significant increase in interest
rates, before anyone other than the most conservative, risk-averse investor
finds 2.5 per cent an attractive option.

FT  04 DEC 93 / The Long View: When Scrooge becomes Santa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You would have thought Kenneth Clarke had produced a giveaway Budget, to
judge from the astonishingly euphoric reactions. In fact he has loaded big
new taxes on top of those pre-programmed last March by Norman Lamont. By
1995-96 the two 1993 Budgets will have imposed another Pounds 15bn in taxes,
and over the next four years total taxes will rise from 34 to 38 per cent of
GDP.
So how on earth, in the first pre-Christmas Budget, did such a Scrooge
manage to present himself almost in the guise of Santa Claus?
Certainly the political presentation was as adroit as Norman Lamont's had
been clumsy. In cleaning up the mess left by Lamont's gaffes over VAT on
domestic energy Clarke seized an opportunity to appear as the pensioner's
friend. He drew back generously from extending the VAT base further.
Wretched public sector workers will bear much of the burden, and his tax
increases were largely hidden and deferred. Indeed, you do not have to be
very cynical to judge that many of the taxes have only been imposed in order
to be flamboyantly removed again in the run-up to the next general election.
So long, that is, as the economy performs more or less as expected.
Above all, this was a Budget for the financial markets. More than ever the
markets are being driven by interest rates, which it now appears probable
will come down further and stay down. Many institutional fund managers plot
their investment strategy on the basis of computer valuation models which
say that if long government bond yields fall the equity market must rise,
almost in proportion. Because the decline in gilt yields this year has been
sharp - more than two percentage points  - the models say share prices are
still cheap.
But the models may need to be tweaked. It is interesting to look back at the
circumstances in which long-dated gilts last yielded the current 6 3/4 per
cent, in June 1967. That was a few months ahead of Harold Wilson's
devaluation, in the early stages of the long financial deterioration which
culminated in gilt yields of 16 per cent in 1974 and inflation of 27 per
cent in 1975.
In June 1967 German bonds yielded a little more than gilts, at 6.9 per cent.
Now, in spite of an intimidating borrowing requirement, German bonds return
under 6 per cent. At home, Bank Rate was 5 1/2 per cent, exactly as now. But
the valuation of equities looked rather different: the dividend yield on the
All-Share Index was 5.2 per cent, compared with today's 3.6 per cent.
It follows that investors today are considerably more optimistic about the
prospects for growth in profits and dividends than they were in 1967. Do
they have reason to be?
Before the Budget, the basic policy problem appeared to revolve around the
threatened twin deficits - the public sector borrowing requirement and the
adverse balance of payments. If you promoted economic growth the PSBR would
decline but the trade gap would become much worse, and eventually
destabilising. If you restrained domestic demand in order to control the
external deficit the PSBR would expand exponentially, potentially becoming
unfinanceable.
Entirely undaunted, the Treasury has swept such contradictions aside. It
blithely assumes that the economy will grow remorselessly at a so-called
'trend' rate of 3 per cent, regardless of the mounting tax burden. As for
the trade crisis, this has simply disappeared. The latest trade statistics
have miraculously improved (although the quality of the new post-Single
Market European Union figures is highly suspect). Invisible earnings have
conveniently become more visible. The current account deficit will only be 1
1/2 per cent of GDP next year, instead of 3 per cent.
The obvious precedent is the 1981 Howe Budget which orthodox economists
predicted would lead to disaster but which paved the way for the growth of
the mid-1980s. Higher taxes permitted reductions in interest rates (and a
downwards float of sterling too). The Keynesians are a spent force these
days but Wynne Godley, king of the doomsters, from his bolthole in America,
has pronounced his curse on the Treasury's growth forecasts.
Essentially, Kenneth Clarke has completed the reversal of economic strategy
following the failure of the UK's flirtation with the European exchange rate
mechanism. While in the ERM we were forced to adopt Germany's lax fiscal
policy offset by high interest rates. Fiscal policy is now being brutally
rebalanced, but interest rates may need to go down to 4 per cent next year
to offset the negative impact on the growth of the economy.
If the drop in the cost of capital, which the markets have been celebrating
this week, gives a boost to investment and output, all will be well. But a
re-run of the 1980s cannot provide the answer. That expansion depended far
too much on the housing boom, not least on the stimulation from the release
of housing equity that rose from Pounds 5bn in 1982 to Pounds 15bn in 1986
and a peak Pounds 22bn in 1988.
This mortgage-financed boom not only helped to create the late 1980s
inflation but also tipped the economy off balance into excessive
consumption. We must not go down this road again. In fact, by progressively
reducing tax relief on mortgage interest the government is removing some of
the financial fuel for a renewed housing market bubble (although it may need
to go further). The question is, however, if we must not depend upon a
housing boom to stimulate the British economy, what can we rely on? It is
hard not to conclude that the equity market will soon be disappointed by the
sluggishness of profits growth.
Santa-Scrooge this week took the British economy back through time towards
financial stability. With luck, he has laid to rest the inflationary ghost
of Christmas past. But for all the stock market's enthusiasm, it is less
than clear that he will be able to summon up the expansive spirit of
Christmas yet to come.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Why the whites handed over their power: Last month South
Africa's white rulers agreed a new constitution which will end white
hegemony. Patti Waldmeir explains how it happened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa has delivered itself of a political miracle: sometime in the
dark hours of November 18, almost imperceptibly, white hands let go their
350-year grip on the baton of power. The combined forces of history,
economics, demography and morality had decreed the end of white rule; and
South Africa's leaders had the grace - or the good sense - to recognise the
inevitable.
The story of their conversion - which began in the late 1970s and reached a
climax the night before the new constitution was signed - is strange and
wonderful. History provides few enough examples of the triumph of pragmatism
over ethnicity, or religion, and South Africa's National Party was scarcely
famous for good sense in the decades of apartheid.
But in the pre-dawn hours of November 18, white hands seized black ones,
offering the cult handshake of the African National Congress to seal a
pragmatic new constitution; and the two men who struggled for months to
complete the deal - Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator, and Roelf Meyer,
his government counterpart - danced until the early hours, in an atmosphere
heady with emotion and exhaustion.
In the days that followed, Meyer and his colleagues have continued to laud a
constitutional deal which included many last-minute reverses for the
National party - a deal which, in essence, permits what the party had always
said was impossible: the handover of state power to blacks. Pleased now to
have any deal at all after a tough four-year struggle, they are convinced
that the voluntary power-sharing promised by the constitution will give them
real clout.
Some days after the momentous night on which the new South Africa was born,
I watched as a Meyer - boyish, handsome and charming - ducked into the ANC's
private lavatory to fix his hair before posing for a victory photo. Moments
later, the equally youthful and charming Ramaphosa did the same; then the
two set off together, laughing, for their appointment with the photographer.
I reflected on the extraordinary trust and goodwill built up over the last
four years of momentous change - and which will no doubt come under serious
strain once the two parties start cohabiting in government - and recalled my
first experience of South Africa: the day in 1985 when Archbishop Desmond
Tutu (while I stood near) intervened to stop a township crowd burning a man
to death during a political funeral.
That year - had I but known it at the time - marked perhaps the first
inevitable step to black rule. When in 1985 President P W Botha promised
equal citizenship to all South Africans, including blacks, the death knell
sounded for apartheid, which had decreed that blacks must live separately as
citizens of distant homelands.
It was not the first step away from white hegemony: as early as the late
1970s, the Afrikaner establishment - through its secret society, the
Broederbond (Brotherhood) - had begun to debate sharing power with
mixed-race Coloureds and Indians, but not with blacks who formed the vast
majority of the population. A participant in one of the early Broederbond
meetings on power sharing remembers, with a rueful chuckle, that it took
place in the holiday home of H F Verwoerd, the late prime minister and grand
architect of apartheid. Reflecting on the irony of history, the participant
remembers that Prof Gerrit Viljoen, then chairman of the Broederbond and a
prime mover of reform under President F W de Klerk, sat beneath a portrait
of Verwoerd as he argued for an end to exclusive white power.
Then, in 1986, Pretoria opened secret negotiations with Nelson Mandela,
serving his 23rd year in prison. His first interlocutor was, ironically,
Kobie Coetsee, the hardline Minister of Justice who is known to oppose many
provisions of the constitution agreed last month. Later, Botha set up a
four-man committee to negotiate with Mandela, including two figures who
remained prominent in the final negotiations: the sharp and ruthless Neil
Barnard, former head of the National Intelligence Service and now head of
the department of Constitutional Development, and Fanie van der Merwe,
eminence grise in the government negotiating team.
Mandela told me and a few colleagues over breakfast in 1992 that he did not
tell his fellow ANC leaders he had met Barnard and van der Merwe. 'They
would have refused,' he said. Members of the committee say their aim in
talking to Mandela was to discover whether he was committed to peace, and
whether he was a communist. By 1989, Pretoria had clearly concluded, in
spite of his continuing refusal to end armed struggle, that Mandela was
essentially a man of peace. In July that year, he was taken to the
presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town to meet President Botha (who
resigned from office weeks later). Mandela remembers the meeting fondly,
recalling that President Botha 'poured the tea himself.'
From the day Botha left office, reform proceeded apace. For, although he
laid the basis for the changes of the 1990s - repealing the nefarious influx
control regulations which kept blacks out of cities, and which forced them
to carry the hated passbook; legalising mixed marriages and relaxing
residential segregation - he left the biggest risks untaken. History will
laud President de Klerk, who took office as acting president in August 1989,
for having the courage to leap where President Botha stood still.
Reform came in a rush with de Klerk's election on September 6, 1989. Mass
public protest was legalised, political prisoners were released, the ANC and
South African Communist Party were unbanned (on February 2 1990) and
finally, on February 11 1990, Nelson Mandela, the world's most famous
political prisoner walked free.
Speaking days before Mandela was released, Con Botha, the senior Nationalist
politician who is now administrator (governor) of Natal province, told the
FT that he and his colleagues felt a great weight lifted from their
shoulders. 'We have to make peace with our black people while we still have
the chance.'
F W de Klerk, who according to some of his colleagues was no early convert
to reform, leapt at the chance to make peace before it was too late. Prof
Viljoen, who retired last year because of ill health, remembers that the
strongest impetus to change came after the 1989 demise of communist regimes
which had been the ANC's main military backers. 'We recognised it as a
unique opportunity in the course of history, a God-given opportunity - we
thought of it very much in Christian terms - to ensure that conflict in
South Africa could be resolved.'
De Klerk drew the parallel with Rhodesia: 'When the opportunity was there
for real constructive negotiation, it was not grasped,' he said in February
1990. 'We are determined not to repeat that mistake.'
With Mandela's release, negotiations began in earnest - always on the basis,
according to de Klerk, that whites 'were not prepared to bow out
apologetically from the stage of history.'
His aim, argues Heribert Adam, the political scientist, was to pre-empt
revolution: not to negotiate himself out of power, but into power under
different circumstances which would have left whites with a veto over major
issues, or at least substantial blocking power in cabinet).
Such a deal may well have been on offer early in the negotiations - although
senior Nats argue that an early deal would have prevented the process of
building trust with the ANC, the main business of the last three years.
That process has undoubtedly been successful: intense relationships
developed over the months with government and ANC negotiators withdrawing
regularly to bush hide-outs for cozy consultations. Their improved relations
were shown on one fishing trip - which Ramaphosa claims was arranged without
his knowledge - when the tough Ramaphosa removed a hook from Meyer's finger.
But by the eve of the deal, entrenched power sharing was no longer on offer.
In the end the balance of advantage shifted decisively towards the ANC.
This shift began after the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, the
multi-party negotiating forum, fell apart in May last year. At its May 15-16
plenary conference, the National Party staged a high risk gamble for power,
and lost. Speaking after the conference ended in disarray, de Klerk seemed
oddly confident of his strength; but the events of the succeeding months
undermined his position.
'The Nats peaked at Codesa,' says a senior ANC negotiator. 'At that point,
the ANC had serious problems: its members were complaining about
negotiations, (Ronnie) Kasrils still had dreams of insurrection, the regime
was dizzy with international invitations, Inkatha was still intact as its
negotiating ally, and the Nats had high hopes of forming a non racial
party.'
Everything went downhill from there. International opinion turned against de
Klerk after the June massacre at Boipatong, for which he was indirectly
blamed; the ANC bolstered its confidence through mass action; and then in
April this year, ANC leader Chris Hani was assassinated, permanently tilting
the balance in the ANC's favour and allowing them to extract the crucial
concession from government: agreement that elections would be held on April
27 next year. That was a trap, from which the government proved unable to
escape.
'In the end, time made it impossible for them to hold out,' says Joe Slovo,
eminence grise of the ANC team. His November 1992 decision to persuade the
ANC to offer a deal based on power-sharing was a crucial step on the way to
last month's deal.
He argues that power sharing is necessary because: 'All we will achieve when
we have won the election is to gain political office. We would not gain
state power in the sense of having a complete transformation on day one of
the police, the armed forces, the judiciary and the civil service'.
To ensure compliance from those constituencies, the ANC needs the National
Party: so Slovo has assured Government negotiators, and so, crucially,
Mandela has assured de Klerk. But power-sharing will be purely voluntary:
'We won the battle for an executive which at the end of the day is based on
majority decision making - something I thought we would not win. None of us
thought, even a week (before), that we could win that,' says Slovo.
'Power sharing? Madiba cracked him,' says another senior ANC negotiator,
referring to the 11th hour meeting between Madiba (Mandela's clan name) and
de Klerk on the eve of the deal. ANC negotiators had let it be known that
they would agree to a requirement that important issues be passed by a
special majority of Cabinet (which would include other parties like the NP).
But Mandela offered no such concession; power would be shared voluntarily,
or not at all.
Mandela would seek consensus where possible; 'but in the end, if we differ,
we are not required to listen to them,' another senior negotiator concludes.
He disputes the definition of power sharing offered by a prominent
Nationalist: 'Whites will still have one hand on the tiller. There will be
other hands and the white hand won't necessarily be the strongest, but it
will be there.' 'How can that be?' asks the ANC man, who is too senior to be
named without embarrassment, 'if it's not in the constitution?'
'We must make ourselves indispensible - that is the recipr for the future,'
counters Meyer while Con Botha adds: 'The failure of apartheid has shown us
the folly of relying on laws alone to sustain yourself.' 'Once you've
crossed the Rubicon, you have to move forward fearlessly in another
direction, even though it is into uncharted waters.'
Another prominent Afrikaner completes the metaphor, and sums up the cautious
optimism which is the true fruit of negotiations: 'We're still between the
devil and the deep blue sea. But at least we've got a raft to take us
through the rapids.'
