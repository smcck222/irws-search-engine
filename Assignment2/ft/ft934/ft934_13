FT  04 DEC 93 / Sterling and shares make gains as markets look for rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London shares, sterling and gilts all rose again yesterday on hopes that the
government would cut interest rates soon.
Investors took the view that, even with the tax rises and spending cuts
unveiled on Tuesday in the Budget, UK growth next year was likely to be
higher than some parts of Europe which are struggling from recession.
The firm trends were helped by strong rises in equity markets in the rest of
Europe, cuts in interest rates in France and Spain and indications that the
Bundesbank was preparing for a further easing in monetary policy.
Continuing the favourable reaction to the Budget, the FT-SE 100 index gained
10.3 to close at a record 3,234.2, a 123-point gain on the week.
Although Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will come under pressure in the
next few weeks to allow a cut in banks' base interest rates from 5.5 per
cent, the pound performed well on expectations of relatively high UK
economic growth.
Sterling climbed 1 1/4 pfennigs to close in London at DM2.565, a gain of
more than 3 pfennigs on the week. Against the dollar, it put on nearly 1
cent yesterday to finish at Dollars 1.4905, and was little changed in New
York. Prices of long-dated gilts rose  1/4 point, for a 3-point gain on the
week. The market believed inflationary forces would remain weak and that the
lower government borrowing requirement would reduce the need for bond sales.
Investor sentiment on the continent was boosted by the Bundesbank's decision
on Thursday to cut its 'repo' rate, which determines money market interest
rates, to 6 per cent from 6.25 per cent for the next five weeks. That
triggered a  1/4 percentage point cut in the French intervention rate to 6.2
per cent and a cut in a key Spanish money market rate to 9 per cent from
9.25 per cent.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Attorney general admits blunder in Nadir case: SFO handed
privileged documents to prosecution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The credibility of Britain's Serious Fraud Office was further damaged
yesterday when the government admitted that privileged documents were
wrongly handed to lawyers prosecuting Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive head of
Polly Peck International, the collapsed trading company.
The admission, in a written House of Commons answer from Sir Nicholas Lyell,
attorney general, bears out one of the allegations about the SFO made by Mr
Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, who resigned in June
over his relationship with Mr Nadir.
Mr Mates claimed yesterday that the SFO had concealed further details from
the attorney general: 'He was not told the whole truth by the SFO. He still
has not been told all of the truth. There is more to come out.'
Sir Nicholas said the error was 'regrettable' but he said there was no
evidence to substantiate any other allegations against the SFO, and ruled
out an independent inquiry.
Mr George Staple, director of the SFO, said he had begun an internal inquiry
into the circulation of the documents.
'The right course remains for Mr Nadir to return to this country to face
trial, and, should he wish to make any complaints about the prosecution's
handling of his case, to raise them with the trial judge,' he said.
Mr Nadir, who fled to northern Cyprus in May, said he would not return to
face 13 charges of theft involving Pounds 34m unless an independent inquiry
was established.
He said other documents had also been handed to the prosecution, and accused
the SFO, Scotland Yard, the attorney general and the Crown Prosecution
Service of conspiring to secure a wrongful conviction.
The admission of SFO bungling is a severe embarrassment to Sir Nicholas, who
was forced to concede he had misled the Commons, which is regarded as a
serious offence, with his statement in June that the privileged documents
had not been circulated.
The opposition appeared unlikely to try to make the admission a resignation
issue. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City affairs spokesman, backed Sir
Nicholas's call for Mr Nadir to return to face trial. 'Unless and until Mr
Nadir comes back to face charges I don't see how these issues can be
disposed of,' he said.
Mr Mates, who is believed to want to return to the government once the Nadir
affair is over, is also thought unlikely to pursue the issue but he will
continue to seek a public inquiry.
He alleged in his resignation speech that the SFO sought to put 'improper
pressure' on the trial judge, that it tried to engineer a 'trial by media'
through leaks to the press, and that there was 'illegal collusion' between
the SFO and the Inland Revenue.

FT  04 DEC 93 / EU urged to focus on making industry more competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Competitiveness should be at the top of the European Union's political
agenda, leading European industrialists urged yesterday.
The European Round Table, which groups 40 top industrialists, called for the
creation of a US-style Competitiveness Council. The group was joined by Mr
Jacques Delors, European Commission president, when it launched its report.
It calls for a European Charter for Industry to serve as a counterweight to
pan-European social policy.
The move comes a week before the Brussels summit of EU heads of government,
which will focus on a white paper on competitiveness, growth and
unemployment finalised by Mr Delors.
The industrialists' blueprint puts more emphasis on deregulation and cutting
costs to industry from legislation and bureaucracy than recent drafts of the
Commission white paper. But both urge big increases in investment,
particularly in infrastructure and information networks, cutting employment
costs and improving training.
The report endorses Mr Delors' call for more co-operation within industry on
research and development.
Mr Floris Maljers, chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products
group and head of the working group that produced the report, said the
Competitiveness Council should have a mandate to report regularly to the EU
on industrial issues.
He said non-wage costs, such as employers' social security contributions,
amounted to 44 per cent of total employment costs in Europe, against 28 per
cent in the US and 24 per cent in Japan. 'Work is there, but not at these
prices,' the report says. 'In effect, Europe has imposed a tax on jobs. It
is time to find a better system.'
The report adds that higher productivity will have to precede higher wages.
Mr Maljers warned against the environment and energy taxes being considered
in the Commission white paper. 'Some of these costs will have to go from
production to consumption,' he argued.
Mr Maljers said the proposed council and the Charter for Industry had two
main aims: to record industry's views on the conditions for restoring
competitiveness; and to look over EU and national legislation in the light
of the need for competition.
The council would have a small, highly qualified membership made up of
industry, government and scientists.
The action plan's suggestion that Ecu200bn (Pounds 152.40bn) a year of
additional investment, worth 4 per cent of European output, is needed to
obtain the 3.5 per cent growth needed to relieve unemployment, is close to
Mr Delors' estimates.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Volvo hopes to maintain Renault link despite halt on merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo will seek to maintain its three-year-old alliance with Renault despite
its decision to abandon plans to merge with the state-owned French vehicle
manufacturer.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive of the Swedish group who led a management
revolt that halted the merger proposal on Thursday, sought yesterday to
limit the damage to relations with Renault.
'I can only say sorry and apologise and hope that France understands,' he
said. 'We must ensure that the common projects (between Volvo and Renault)
continue to be developed.'
The French government said it continued to believe the merger remained
desirable. 'However, the opinions held by Volvo executives need to
clarified,' it said in a statement.
But Volvo said there was no immediate prospect of renegotiating a full
merger and Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman, emphasised the difficulty
of future co-operation. The companies were likely to discuss their joint
prospects very soon, Volvo said.
Mr Schweitzer said the existing alliance, including cross-shareholdings and
joint purchasing and product development, remained in effect. But he added
the merger's failure would damage the momentum of co-operation and require
existing collaboration to be appraised on a case by case basis.
He expressed pessimism over the flagship P4 project to build a new range of
executive cars.
Mr Gyll sought to bolster morale within Volvo after the board decision,
which prompted the resignation of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman who had
led Volvo for 22 years, and four other directors.
Officials said a meeting of shareholders, whose hostility to the merger
sparked the crisis, would be called early in the new year to elect a new
chairman and board. Mr Gyll is expected to be confirmed as chief executive.
In meetings with managers and employees at Volvo's headquarters in
Gothenburg, Mr Gyll emphasised the group's financial strength and his
determination to bind the internal wounds opened by the merger proposal.
Volvo officials said a strategy review would include consideration of how to
raise up to SKr8bn (Pounds 645m) in extra capital. The options are a share
issue and sales of non-core assets.
Mr Schweitzer said the merger's failure did not threaten Renault's future or
compromise plans to privatise the car group. Other investors could be found
to act as a counterweight to Volvo's 20 per cent stake in Renault.

FT  04 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda's decision to sweep its troubled Allied business under the carpet by
handing it over to a rival operator is doubtless the right thing to do from
the management's perspective. Allied was a peripheral loss-making business
which had been consuming a disproportionate share of cash and management
time. Since the late 1980s, Asda has poured more than Pounds 100m into
Allied to little apparent effect. The company has incurred operating losses
of Pounds 17.7m over the past two years and is unlikely to produce a glowing
contribution to Asda's interim results, to be released later this month.
Nevertheless, the disposal will come as a severe blow to Asda's finances,
requiring a Pounds 123.3m charge against its profit and loss account under
the FRS3 regime. The acquisition of a 40 per cent equity stake in the
enlarged Carpetland may offer little by way of compensation if the new
owners find Allied's problems equally intractable. Still, it is worth
recalling that the risky venture capital Asda retained in MFI eventually
produced considerable rewards.
Asda will certainly benefit from being able to devote more management time
to its grocery chain. The challenge on that front is growing stiffer by the
day. Asda was able to steal a march on competitors two years ago when it
became the first superstore to emphasise consistently low prices. Its rivals
are belatedly responding.

FT  04 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Brewing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget has certainly brought some cheer to the brewing sector. Since
Tuesday, Scottish &amp; Newcastle is up by 10 per cent, Bass by 6, Whitbread by
5 and Allied-Lyons by 3. Though part of the reason is the pleasing
second-half results from Bass, the main impetus came from the chancellor's
decision not to raise the duty on beer. The Treasury seems finally to have
realised that higher duty could simply see its revenue fall. The UK beer
market is shrinking and, according to Bass, parallel imports from the
Continent now account for 3 per cent of total domestic consumption.
In that environment, a taxation policy which reverses some of the
discrimination in favour of wine and cider - duties on both were increased -
can only help. But while the trend is in the right direction, the movement,
saving perhaps 1p a pint on beer and adding 2p to the price of a bottle of
wine, is minuscule. Factor that into the poor market conditions which
wrought the concession out of the Treasury in the first place, and one
wonders why the stock market is so excited.
The brewers which managed to push through large real increases in the beer
price a couple of years ago do not have a particularly strong leg to stand
on. But Bass is probably right to claim that in present conditions an actual
cut in duties may be required to rekindle growth in demand. That is also an
admission of how limited the scope is for the brewers to raise their prices.
It has become even more difficult since Tuesday, when they were deprived of
even the chance to slip a little into their own pockets when passing on the
chancellor's duty demand.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's 10-point gain in the FT-SE 100 index shows London is still
determined to take a positive view of the Budget, despite disappointing
subsequent news from big companies like Hanson and GEC. In part that must
stem from the prospect of lower interest rates, which loom a little closer
after Continental cuts helped push sterling over DM2.56 yesterday. It helps,
too, that the Budget was so positive for gilts. New gilt issues will be
markedly lower in 1993-94. That should fuel demand just as base rate hopes
buoy up the short end of the market and make funding even easier.
At some point, though, the equity market will have to respond to the
earnings outlook. According to BZW, more companies have been reporting
results below expectations than above them in recent weeks. This unusual
phenomenon may reflect companies' reluctance to guide forecasts down ahead
of results, but it also suggests the market is working on false premises.
Nor does it seem to have factored in the risk to consumer confidence once
tax rises start to bite next year.
With low interest rates reducing the attraction of cash, that creates
something of an investment dilemma. The safest haven may be shares with a
relatively high yield and secure prospects of dividend growth. That would
explain the outperformance of water and electricity shares since Tuesday,
not to mention the euphoric response to Royal Bank's 25 per cent dividend
increase.

FT  04 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Life closes in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The regulatory grip on the life insurance industry is tightening, and not
before time. The Securities and Investments Board investigation into
mis-selling of personal pensions should not, by itself, cause shareholders
much worry. Even if SIB finds widespread malpractice, the life funds of the
companies concerned should bear the bulk of the costs. But the investigation
comes at an awkward moment. Full disclosure of commissions and expenses
demanded by government threatens to drive investors towards other forms of
saving, while the review of taxes on savings promised by the chancellor
before the Budget poses an unknown threat.
More immediately, the dull outlook for investment returns points to further
reductions in bonus rates for policyholders. It might seem strange that
bonuses should be cut again after such a strong performance from equities
and bonds this year. But many life companies are still making amends for
paying over-generous bonuses in the past. Windfall stock market gains in the
1980s are also dropping out of bonus calculations. With long-dated gilts now
yielding less than 7 per cent, and UK equities only a shade over 3.5 per
cent, the long-term prognosis for investment returns remains poor.
Since profits are linked directly to bonuses paid out of the life fund,
shareholders will also feel the pain. Companies which keep expenses down and
sales rising - despite the new disclosure regime - will prosper even when
investment returns are low. The rest will find their ability to raise
profits and dividends increasingly constrained. The gulf between winners and
losers in life insurance looks set to widen.

FT  04 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Employment data give lift to
Dow
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks edged into positive territory yesterday after the bond market
reacted to strong November employment data with surprising equanimity,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.96 ahead at 3,704.07,
and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a broader measure, was up 1.78 at 464.89. The
American FE composite gained 2.47 to 466.32, while technology stocks helped
lift the Nasdaq composite by 5.49 to 772.22. Trading volume on the NYSE was
moderate at 268m shares. Advancing issues led decliners, 1,204 to 806.
After a string of bullish economic news in recent days, investors' attention
yesterday morning was riveted on the release of the Labor Department's
monthly employment report, which proved to be much stronger than expected.
The Commerce Department's index of leading indicators did nothing to
undercut the impression of a bubbling economy. It showed a 0.5 per cent gain
in October, compared with revised increases of 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent
for the previous two months.
However, instead of a big sell-off in inflation-sensitive bonds, the 30-year
government issue in late trading was  7/16 firmer at 100, to yield 6.244 per
cent. At the short end, prices were unchanged.
Nerves were steadied in part by a Market News Service report quoting Federal
Reserve governor Edward Kelley as questioning whether the strong
fourth-quarter growth rate was sustainable. In addition, the employment
report may have contained a silver lining ' slow wage growth ' which
mitigated any suggestion of mounting inflationary pressure.
Retailing stocks were active for a second straight session. In heavy
trading, The Limited slipped a further Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 in
response to poor sales data released Thursday.
By contrast, Dayton Hudson rebounded by Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 7/8 .
Investors marked JC Penney up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 after leaving
the stock unchanged the previous session, in spite of the company's worthy
performance last month.
In its first day of trading, Pactel, the mobile communications arm of
Pacific Telesis, climbed Dollars 2 1/2 above its opening price of Dollars
23. The parent company's stock was Dollars  1/4 ahead at Dollars 57 7/8 .
Corning climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 7/8 and Dow Chemical added
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 58 5/8 after a judge ruled the two companies were
not liable for injuries in more than 3,000 federal cases involving silicone
breast implants.
Shaw, the largest US carpet manufacturer, dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 42
3/4 . Canada
Toronto share prices ended slightly higher in moderate trading. The TSE-300
composite index was up 13.04 points, or 0.31 per cent, to 4,239.36, for a
gain on the week of about 19 points. Winning issues were ahead of losers by
399 to 373. Volume rose to 66.72m shares from 61.08m and trading value was
CDollars 714.9m compared with CDollars 670. m.

setting ways
</HEADLINE>

Another round of strong and, in some cases, record performances were seen
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT went into the weekend in positive spirit with a rise in the DAX
index at the official close of 10.08 to 2,120.61, its second successive
record high . However, this was slightly below an intraday high of 2,123.13.
In the post-bourse the unofficial Ibis indicated index made further gains,
ending at 2,128. The DAX index gained 3.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was
DM9.1bn.
The authorities announced yesterday that from December 14 the DAX index will
be available after the close of official trading at 1.30pm, with data
calculated up to 5pm 'on the basis of prices determined in the electronic
trading system Ibis'.
The stronger dollar helped a number of stocks while interest was also seen
in the chemical sector, Bayer for instance gaining DM4.30 to DM343.00. This
stock was helped by a positive meeting earlier in the week, with Goldman
Sachs rating the shares now as moderate outperformers: 'We continue to feel
that management's stated expectations of only a stable 1994 reflect a very
cautious stance and that earnings progress should begin to emerge during the
course of next year.'
The market's attraction to RWE followed on ahead of next week's dividend
payment, the shares rising a further DM2.80 to DM490.80.
PARIS built up throughout the session with the CAC-40 index closing up 27.95
at 2,188.40 following the cut in rates by the Bank of France early on. The
market has gained 3.2 per cent during the week. Turnover was FFr3.9bn.
Canal Plus and Peugeot, which had both been depressed on Thursday by
different factor, picked up again, with respective gains of FFr50 and FFr15
to FFr1,300 and FFr730. Investors still see short-term potential in Canal
Plus in spite of worries over the extension of its franchise.
STOCKHOLM fell prey to profit-taking in Volvo B shares after their surge
during the week ahead of Thursday's decision to abandon the Renault merger.
The Affarsvarldsen index fell 9.3 to 1,336.2 for a 1.8 per cent rise on the
week.
Turnover of SKr1.2bn was dominated by SKr436m of business in the Volvo B
shares, which fell SKr17 to SKr441.
James Capel which upgraded the stock to a buy yesterday, noted that in the
short term, Volvo's earnings were in a recovery phase, helped by currency
considerations, cost-cutting and higher sales in the US and Britain. As a
result, 1994 earnings per share were likely to be substantially higher than
if the merger had gone ahead.
MILAN received a late boost as the head of the lower chamber of deputies
budget committee said that agreement with opposition parties had been
reached on a package that will be sent to the full chamber.
The Comit index finished 0.90 higher at 549.84, also benefiting from short
covering ahead of the weekend. The index rose 1.5 per cent over the week.
Kleinwort Benson which has upgraded its recommendation on Italy from neutral
to overweight, noted that Milan had been Europe's worst performing market
recently and commented that investors had overreacted to the first round of
local election results a fortnight ago. Kleinwort added that the 1994 budget
package should be approved by the end of the year, paving the way for lower
interest rates and early elections.
Foreign demand took Fiat L38 higher to L3,976. Ifil, a Fiat group company,
rose L256 or 5.7 per cent to L4,770 on news that Arab Banking Corporation
had taken a stake in its retailer, Rinascente.
Credito Italiano dipped L10 to L2,309 ahead of today's pricing for the
privatisation.
BRUSSELS rose to a new high with the Bel-20 index finishing up 15.85 at
1,423.67, for a week's gain of 2.3 per cent. Turnover was BFr2.2bn.
Banking stocks went against the trend with some analysts commenting that
they might be asked to make extra contributions to the government's
austerity programme. Banque Bruxelles Lambert fell BFr65 to BFr4,250 in good
volume.
AMSTERDAM was supported by the easing in domestic interest rates and the CBS
Tendency index gained 0.7 to 139.0, for a week's rise of 1.6 per cent.
Hoogovens put on Fl 2.60 to Fl 43.10 as the steel group announced that that
its rights issue was heavily oversubscribed.
ING, which produced good figures on Thursday, eased 40 cents to Fl 85.50.
MADRID was pulled higher by the strength of the futures market and the
general index added 3.34 to 304.15 or 2.3 per cent up on the week. Turnover
was a high Pta29bn. Foreign demand took Repsol Pta150 or 3.6 per cent higher
to Pta4,290.

FT  04 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Zurich offers feeling of security, even
at peaks - A third year of strong growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barring a last minute catastrophe, the Swiss stock market is about to
complete its third year in a row of handsome double digit growth.
Yesterday, the all-share SPI index finished at a record 1,782.81, a dazzling
44 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year, while the narrower SMI
index of 18 leading shares was an impressive 33 per cent ahead at a peak of
2,819.3. Both indices also advanced strongly this week, in response to a
combination of good economic statistical news and rumours - a couple of them
a bit wild - of mergers and acquisitions.
Yet the near unanimous message of equity analysts, both in Switzerland and
in London, is that the Swiss market is still a good one to buy. 'It is still
one of the markets where the investor has the least cause to worry,' says Mr
Nick Stevenson, European equity strategist at London bankers SG Warburg.
'We are still fundamentally positive,' echoes Mr Frederick Hasslauer at
Banksal Oppenheim (Schweiz) in Zurich. 'The interest rate story is not over,
and Switzerland has a better record on inflation than most other European
countries.'
The argument for the Swiss market, in a week when the latest statistical
reports from the federal government showed inflation down to 2.2 per cent
and annualised GDP rising 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, is not as
difficult to make as one might think.
'The market has been liquidity driven, and that will continue, but it will
also be more earnings driven than other European markets,' says Mr Bernhard
Tschanz of Credit Suisse in Zurich.
The basic point is that the long awaited economic recovery in Europe is
still looking uncertain, and in those circumstances, the renowned defensive
qualities of the Swiss market plus the country's strong currency make it a
safe bet.
Moreover, in spite of its long and strong run, the Swiss market is still not
that expensive on fundamental grounds compared with other European markets.
Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss brokerage research at Bank Julius Baer in
Zurich, points out that the market is only 28 per cent ahead of the previous
peak in 1987, and he estimates that current prices are at about 13 times
1994 earnings.
Although the prospects for economic recovery in Europe are uncertain, the
leading companies in the Swiss market are all expected to show continued
earnings growth. Baer estimates that overall earnings will be up 25 per cent
next year compared with a probable 16 per cent growth this year.
And analysts believe that the reliability of earnings estimates in respect
of Swiss companies is far greater than that on companies elsewhere. The
leading Swiss companies may have adopted international accounting standards
in the last couple of years, but everyone knows that they have not lost
their ultra conservative tendency to stuff away and use reserves to smooth
out earnings trends.
The big Swiss banks, which are having a spectacular year thanks mainly to
volatile securities and currency markets, are piling up provisions as high
as they can so that even if next year's results are not as brilliant as this
year's, they can still show some profit growth.
Many industrial companies, for whom 1993 has not been pleasant at all, are
doing the same thing, on the grounds that a little more red ink this year
won't bother anyone, but will help their expected rebound next year.
Thus, the expectation is that the market will continue rising, although Mr
Tschanz and others caution that there is not the same upside potential as
there has been.
They also warn that it will become more difficult to pick winners. 'It will
be much more important to pick the right stocks in 1994. This year, you just
had to pick the right sectors,' Mr Tschanz says.
For the moment, the top banks, insurance companies and pharmaceutical
companies are still the favourites, although other interest rate sensitive
stocks, such as the electric utilities, Electrowatt and Motor Columbus, have
attracted a lot of interest lately.
These two are also the subject of merger speculation, as both Credit Suisse,
which controls Electrowatt, and Union Bank of Switzerland, which controls
Motor, are said to want to shed these peripheral activities. Retailers got a
boost this week from the report that real consumption of private households
rose an annualised 2.7 per cent in the third quarter.
But cyclical stocks are lying low, as recent reports from engineering group
ABB Asea Brown Boveri and cement producer Holderbank indicated that no
upturn is yet in sight.
Sceptics about the Swiss market could point to that sure sign of excess,
wild rumours, appearing in recent days. According to one story floating
around this week, Ciba, the pharmaceutical and chemicals group, would take
over Ems-Chemie, the specialist chemical maker run by the controversial
Christoph Blocher. And there was a tale on Thursday that CS Holding, parent
of Credit Suisse, had taken a stake in Germany's Commerzbank.
The more serious worry, if it can be called that, is an earlier than
expected economic recovery in Europe. 'If you believe in a big recovery,
Switzerland is the last place you want to be,' Mr Stevenson says.

Dealers moved to close their positions ahead of the weekend and the
government's announcement of its emergency package next week, withshares
closing marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 0.60 to 17,459.35, a week's rise of 4.4 per cent. The
Topix index of all first section stocks fell 5.01 to 1,460.11. Share prices
fluctuated on cautious trading following the resignation of the defence
minister the previous night, and a possible delay in the adoption of the
supplementary budget as a result. The index fell to a day's low of 17,177.32
in the morning but buying in the futures market by financial institutions
later supported shares, and the index rose to a day's high of 17,468.85 just
before the close.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.65 to 1,182.86.
Trading was led by dealers and tokkin, or specified money trusts. Volume was
270m shares against 446m. Declines led advances by 729 to 283 with 145
issues remaining unchanged. Bank shares gained ground on buy-backs by
leading US houses. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y50 to Y2,870 and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y30 to Y1,970.
Isetan, a leading department store, fell by its daily limit of Y300 to
Y1,480. The retailer announced on Thursday that Shuwa, the stock and
property speculator, had agreed to sell its 27 per cent stake in Isetan for
Y1,300 to companies linked to Mitsubishi Bank, Isetan's main creditor and
shareholder, and other Isetan related corporations. Shuwa cornered Isetan's
shares during the late 1980s and had tried to sell them to other leading
supermarkets and large retailers looking to expand their operations.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 136.85 to 19,319.74 in volume of 22.7m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y300 to Y6,790 on profit
taking.
Roundup

Volume was 628.5m worth MDollars 3bn.
Tenaga Nasional rose 20 cents to MDollars 16.80.
HONG KONG improved although many investors remained absent awaiting further

The Hang Seng index rose 56.15 to 9,294.35 after advancing 77 points
earlier, barely changed over the week. Turnover was HKDollars 5.34bn against

Selective buying of blue chips and brisk trading in Malaysian OTC shares
boosted volume to 327.3m shares.
SEOUL rebounded from its recent consolidation phase, with the composite
index adding 5.69 to 806.86, and 0.5 per cent on the week. Posco, the

changed hands.
AUSTRALIA traded in a narrow range and the All Ordinaries index added 0.1 to

Turnover was ADollars 384.9m.

FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils pressured
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet another slide in crude oil prices caused consternation but little in the
way of substantial downside pressure in the oil sector. BP came under
limited pressure late in the session, closing 3 1/2 down at 332p. Shell gave
a powerful performance, closing 7 1/2 ahead at 701 1/2 p as some
institutions continued to switch out of BP.
Brent for January delivery dropped below the psychologically important
Dollars 14 a barrel level, slipping to Dollars 13.65 before rallying to
Dollars 13.85, its lowest level since November 1988. 'It's not looking good
at all for the oils, especially the exploration stocks,' said one
specialist. He added that if crude prices stay at current levels for any
length of time then the exploration companies 'will have to start looking at
their forward planning schedules.'
Enterprise, the highest-rated stock in the sub-sector, moved up 10 to 447p,
with buying still being stimulated by recent presentations to Scottish
institutions, the recent buy note issued by Kleinwort Benson and talk of
more positive broker research in the pipeline.
Reports that the Securities and Investment Board, the insurance industry
watchdog, is planning a further investigation into pension plan transfers
triggered a bout of hefty selling throughout the life sector.
The severest pressure fell on Prudential, whose shares closed 9 1/2 lower at
360 1/2 p, after turnover of 9.5m shares. Legal &amp; General dipped 7 to 532p
on 2.4m traded. Lloyds Abbey slipped 5 to 449p on 1.7m shares.
Most food manufacturing stocks remained under pressure as worries over
margins - prompted by warnings this week of more pain to come from
supermarket group Argyll - continued. Hillsdown slipped 4 to 149p,
Cadbury-Schweppes 8 to 467p and Booker 2 to 394p. International exposure
kept Unilever strong, up 10 to 1170p.
Expectations ahead of results on Monday lifted Scottish and Newcastle, the
shares adding 18 to 538p. Profit-takers were in evidence as Allied Lyons
fell 6 to 411p and Bass the same amount to 531p. SG Warburg was said to be
recommending a switch out of Guinness, down 2 1/2 at 471p, and into Grand
Metropolitan, ahead 4 1/2 at 434 1/2 p.
Dealers said there was a bear squeeze in Rank Organisation, sending the
shares forward 25 to 909p. The sharp rise inevitably gave rise to renewed
talk over the possibility of Rank selling its stake in Rank Xerox. After a
tortuous week in the market, Ladbroke finally moved into positive territory,
the shares edging a penny to 145p. Turnover, at 10m, was again heavy.
Conglomerate Hanson saw another day of frenetic trading following Thursday's
disappointing results and the shares shed 3 to 265 1/2 p on turnover of 34m.
There was also busy trading in the options market. The stock hit a low of
260p but dealers said there was chart support at 262p which encouraged value
buying.
The television sector retraced some of the week's gains as Kleinwort Benson
argued that an over-estimation of projected airtime sales by Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees could impact on the rest of the sector. YTT fell 4 to 179p, Scottish
lost 4 to 493p and Anglia slipped 3 to 451p.
There were reports of downgradings in BTR, said to be from James Capel and
Cazenove. The shares closed down 5p at 346p. ASW recovered 10 to 158p, after
its recent profits warning.
November traffic results from British Airways' caused little excitement with
a slight reduction in passenger load factors. The shares were steady at
430p.

FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs revive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the post-Budget buying spree waned, investors sat back and looked at
areas of the market which have been left behind. The health and household
sector was one of the first to spring to mind - it has underperformed the
FT-All Share Index by almost 40 per cent over the past year.
A year ago the p/e ratio on the 500 Index, which reflects the performance of
all stocks excluding financial issues, was 17.12 while the health and
household sector, traditionally viewed as a fast growing area was above 23.
At the close of trading on Thursday the position was reversed. Several of
the sector's leading companies are now seen as low growth yield stocks
rather than rising stars. Hoare Govett sees Glaxo yielding 5 per cent and
Zeneca 4.8 per cent.
That yield potential was underlined as the market caught wind of a further
cut in base rates yesterday. Glaxo, which received approval for an influenza
compound to be tested on humans in the United States next year, rose 8 1/2
to 695 1/2 p, It was also said to have been upgraded by Smith Barney in the
US. Zeneca gained 11 to 796p , Wellcome 8 to 684p and SmithKline Beecham 5
1/2 to 399p.

FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Support for banks continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The startling gains in bank shares this week, based partly on the market's
reaction to the Budget, but also on Royal Bank of Scotland's sparkling
preliminary results, were often extended yesterday as marketmakers scrambled
to cover short positions.
In a classic bear squeeze, Standard Chartered powered ahead to another
all-time high, closing 43 up at 1153p, after turnover of 1.9m, while Abbey
National also reached a peak, settling 15 better at 452p after big turnover
of 9.4m.
TSB continued to attract much higher than usual activity, the shares moving
ahead to 237 1/2 p on 9m traded, with the market said to have been caught on
the wrong foot. There was also speculation that the bank could be
considering the sale of its United Dominions Trust business. TSB, the next
big bank to report preliminary figures, announces profits in January.
Royal Bank of Scotland rounded off a splendid week on a sound note, the
shares edging up 2 to 430p, a week's gain of 46p, or 12 per cent, after the
exceptional results which saw the dividend total increased by no less than
25 per cent.
Bank specialists continued to highlight the substantial shift in sentiment
in the bank sector, which it was said, could quickly respond to a steep
decline in bad debt provisions and recent cost cutting. There was, however,
significant profit-taking in Barclays, 5 lower at 609p, while HSBC was hit
by bearish news on the Anglo/Chinese talks on Hong Kong.

FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Closing peak for the FT-SE 100 Share
Index - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market ended Budget week on a triumphant note yesterday,
with the FT-SE 100 Share Index pushing through to a new closing peak, helped
by firmness in sterling and in UK government bonds. Earlier in the session,
the UK market traced an erratic pattern and the focus on domestic factors
restrained it from following the upward trend in other European bourses
which greeted the cut in French interest rates.
Technical factors also helped the UK market ahead. Although the squeeze in
the futures market eased, the premium on the December contract on the
Footsie remained strong and the pressures were transferred to the equity
market where marketmakers have been caught badly short of stock this week.
There were reports that some marketmakers urgently sought a widening of
price spreads yesterday.
After moving between an early low of 3,212.2, followed quickly by a day's
high of 3,240.8, the FT-SE Index closed 10.3 higher at 3,234.2. The FT-SE
Mid 250 Index edged ahead by 0.6 to 3,566.5, also a closing peak. Seaq
volume died away a little to 747.1m shares compared with 1,048.6m in the
previous session. Thursday's retail business was worth Pounds 2.31bn, among
the highest daily totals for the year, and confirming the increased business
levels which have cheered securities firms in the City of London this year.
Government bonds also showed uncertainty at first as profits were taken in
the wake of the dramatic rise of the past two trading sessions. Firmness in
sterling and in the sterling future contract at the very close of trading
spurred a recovery in bond prices.
Short-dated gilts ended a touch firmer as confidence that UK base rates will
be cut soon after Christmas grew stronger. The longer dates, reflecting
similar confidence that domestic inflation will remain low, gained around
1/4 points higher, bringing yields down to 6.76 per cent.
At last night's close, the Footsie showed a gain of 122.8 points or nearly 4
per cent over the week. Investment confidence has been boosted by the
absence from the UK Budget of the feared assault on the tax status of the UK
pension funds and by the relatively benign stance adopted by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer.
Some further selling pressure was seen in oil stocks, however, as
international investors continued to back away in the face of the persistent
weakness in global oil prices.
There were further gains yesterday in the bank stocks which will benefit
quickly from improvement in the trading success of their customers, many of
whom feature on the banks' bad debt lists and also in store and consumer
issues which look for early cuts in base rates. Firmness in pharmaceutical
issues provided a boost for market indices.
While most equity strategists remained optimistic for the near term, there
were warnings that Friday afternoon is well known as a treacherous time for
investors. A highly optimistic weekend press review of the Budget and of the
stock market's response is expected and the stock market expects increased
private investor activity.
This week's interest rate cuts in Europe, although not spearheaded by the
Bundesbank, have strengthened the likelihood that the UK base rates cuts
widely predicted by analysts in London could come earlier in the New Year
than expected.

FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers were surprised once again by the hefty premium in the futures market
and said it was largely responsible for preventing the cash market slipping
into negative territory, writes Peter John.
The cash market wanted to take a pause after hectic post-Budget gains but
the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 index, expiring in two weeks, refused
to give ground.
When the December contract opened at 3,243 it was at a premium of some 29
points to cash. Most marketmakers calculate however that for the last two
weeks of its trading life the contract should have no estimated fair value
and should, perhaps, be at a small discount to cash.
December closed at 3,247 with some 12,900 contracts traded. The cash market
closed at 3,234.2.
Options volume was down to more normal levels with turnover of almost 42,000
contracts. Hanson was the most active stock option with more than 4,300 lots
dealt.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Rates eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French and Spanish authorities took their cue from the Bundesbank
yesterday to cut their interest rates by a quarter of a point, writes Rachel
Johnson.
The French cut their intervention rate by 25 basis points to 6.2 per cent,
while the Spanish central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by the
same amount to 9 per cent at its regular seven to twelve day repurchase
tender.
Both moves followed the Bundesbank's clearing of the decks for lower
European interest rates with its 25 basis-point cut in the repo rate to 6
per cent on Thursday. The Bundesbank said the rate would not change until
January 5, taking the steam out of market speculation of a cut on December
16.
The unexpected aspect of the French move was timing. The Bank of France
announced the rate for its repurchase tender yesterday, days before it takes
place on Monday.
In London, the French franc rose to close at FFr3.437 against the D-Mark,
after a previous FFr3.446. Currencies which have had their interest rates
cut over the past couple of days rose against the D-Mark.
This follows the pattern in European currencies since the summer crisis in
the exchange rate mechanism: investors have been favouring currencies with
better growth prospects rather than those with the highest interest rates.
The Spanish peseta was the latest to flout conventional wisdom by rallying
against the D-Mark after the  1/4 point cut in its money rate.
The peseta set a Pta82.74 low after the rate cut news but closed higher in
London at Pta82.26 compared with the previous close of Pta82.37.
The dollar rose against the D-Mark on the back of encouraging US payroll
data but its rise was not sustained for long.
Figures from the US Labour Department showed a rise of 208,000 in non-farm
payrolls in November, with the unemployment rate at 6.4 per cent, better
than analysts' expectations of 170,000 and 6.7 per cent respectively.
Sterling rallied against the dollar and the D-Mark, gaining over a pfennig
on the German currency and around a cent on the dollar in late European
trading. Rate cuts in France and Spain helped underpin the pound, as did the
fizzling-out of the dollar's rise very soon after the US data had been
released. Investor interest in UK government bonds and shares helped boost
the pound.
In London, sterling closed at DM2.5650, after a previous DM2.5525, and
against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.4905, after a previous Dollars
1.4825.
On the UK money markets, expectations of a further cut in interest rates
were only modestly reflected in the three-month interbank rate which
finished at around 5 9/32 , unchanged on its previous close. But the
December short sterling contract closed around 6 basis points higher at
94.70 amid continuing high expectations for further monetary easing.
France's decision to cut lending rates served to strengthened optimism among
money market dealers that Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget opened the way for a
sustained, lower level of interest rates.
In the morning the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 2.15bn. The
forecast was later revised to Pounds 2.3bn. This was removed in afternoon
operations and no late assistance was offered.
German call money eased in a liquid market, encouraged by the Bundesbank's
decision on Thursday to lower its repo rate.
Cash was on offer as banks, in anticipation of cheaper money, unloaded
liquidity which they had obtained from the Bundesbank at the former rate of
6.25 per cent.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Iraq fears send oil to
5-year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL market ended a nervous week with a tentative recovery from fresh
five-year lows reached early yesterday.
As with other recent setbacks, the morning selling that pushed the February
futures price to Dollars 13.85 a barrel at one point was linked to concern
about the prospect of Iraq returning to the market sooner rather than later.
In late trading, however, the price had moved up to Dollars 14.07 a barrel,
down 9 cents on the day and 68 cents on the week.
Last week's downward reaction to the failure of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries's ministerial meeting to agree on production
cuts continued on Monday, pushing the February futures price down another 35
cents to Dollars 14.40 a barrel.
Tuesday saw prices staging a modest recovery for most of the day, but that
was reversed in late trading after Iraq announced that it might negotiate
with the United Nations about a one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil
to finance humanitarian aid and compensation to victims of the 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. It had earlier rejected this idea, seeking instead a permanent
easing of UN export sanctions.
Prices steadied on Wednesday but moved sharply lower again on Thursday as
the fears about Iraqi sales adding to the present oversupply returned to the
fore.
At the London Metal Exchange copper led a general rise in base metals
prices. Having broken through technical resistance on Thursday the three
months copper price climbed to Dollars 1,688.50 a tonne before backtracking
to Dollars 1,679.75 at yesterday's close, up Dollars 24.25 on the week.
Aluminium prices took a prominent part in the rally until they succumbed
yesterday to disappointed selling following the overnight announcement that
no specific production cuts had been agreed at inter-government talks in
Washington.
At the two-day meeting US, Russian, Australian, Canadian, Norwegian and
European Union officials had discussed ways of easing the severe oversupply
that has been driving aluminium prices lower since the collapse of the
Soviet Union released a flood of metal from the former Eastern bloc (chiefly
Russia). There had never been much hope of substantial progress being made
at this stage, but news that the delegates had succeeded only in identifying
objectives and had deferred consideration of practicalities to follow-up
talks scheduled for January 18-19 nevertheless prompted a sharpish market
sell-off.
By yesterday's close the LME three months delivery price, which climbed as
high as Dollars 1,088 a tonne on Thursday, was quoted at Dollars 1,075.75 a
tonne, down Dollars 9 on the day but still Dollars 17.25 up on the week.
Lead was once again the strongest LME market, with prices maintaining the
strong upward trend that began late last week. The three months price closed
yesterday at Dollars 446.50 a tonne, up Dollars 18 on balance but Dollars
2.50 below the seven-month high reached on Thursday. Dealers attributed the
market's strength to increased demand from car battery makers and tightness
of supplies of lead concentrate (an intermediate material).
The London Commodity Exchange cocoa market struggled to build on recent
gains as fresh harvest news was awaited from west African growing regions.
The March futures position edged up to a 5 3/4 -year high of Pounds 1,064 a
tonne yesterday afternoon and ended Pounds 8 up on the week at Pounds 1,061
a tonne.

FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: Delay on super-share ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation will not know until next year whether
it is permitted to issue its controversial 'super-voting' shares.
After a meeting yesterday between the Australian attorney-general, Mr
Michael Lavarch, and Mr Laurie Cox, head of the Australian Stock Exchange,
the ASX said that if it decided to alter listing rules to accommodate News
Corp's request, it would first issue a formal 'exposure draft', detailing
the proposed changes.
There would then be an unspecified period during which comments would be
sought. The attorney-general would then have 28 days to allow or disallow
the decision.
This process means that no rule change could come into effect until well
into 1994. The ASX is shifting through about 60 responses to its earlier
discussion document, dealing with principles underlying differential voting
rights. The earliest date on which it might consider the results of this
process is December 21 - but it now seems likely that even that
determination will be pushed back to late January.
In any event, the subsequent comment period on the exposure draft will
ensure that no rule change becomes operative until well into the new year.
The attorney-general's office, meanwhile, said it planned to set up an
'expert advisory' group, to look at the issues surrounding the introduction
of differential voting rights and the implications for public policy.
Membership of the group will be announced shortly. The group would be
expected to participate in the comment period following publication of an
exposure draft.
Mr Murdoch in October first outlined his plans to issue 'super voting'
shares - ones with multiple voting rights - on a pro rata basis to existing
shareholders. But the scheme has generated enormous controversy, with
critics claiming it would serve to entrench the Murdoch family at News, at
the expense of other shareholders. News, by contrast, has argued that the
scheme is required so that it can pursue joint ventures without management
becoming vulnerable.

FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: BCE pays Dollars 275m for stake
in US cable TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BCE, Canada's biggest company, has finally sold its financial services and
property interests and is investing in US cable TV in preparation for the
multi-media age.
BCE will now be solely a telecommunications group with large international
interests in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It controls 54 per cent of
Northern Telecom, the international equipment make.
'Our policy is to pursue leadership in telecommunications,' said Mr Lynton
Wilson, chairman.
The group is paying USDollars 275m for 30 per cent of Jones Intercable, a
Colorado-based cable TV operator with a subscriber base of 1.3m homes in 24
states and cable investment in the UK and Spain.
BCE has an option to take 51 per cent of Jones and will invest in its
expansion.
BCE said the move gives it a major presence in the US home entertainment
market without making a 'blockbuster investment of the kind that some US
telephone companies have made'. It already has cable TV investments in the
UK.
In addition BCE has sold its fully-owned loss-making financial services
unit, Montreal Trustco, Canada's fourth biggest trust company, to the Bank
of Novia Scotia for nearly CDollars 300m in the bank's stock. The deal
includes all MT assets and liabilities except CDollars 100m of office
buildings.
BCE is expected to sell the bank shares and the office buildings. It paid
CDollars 1bn for MT in 1989 as a diversification, including a recent capital
infusion. It will take a CDollars 400m write-down to cover its losses on the
deal.
BCE is disposing of its remaining property interests to Carena, a Hees-Edper
holding company, for a nominal sum. This will require a CDollars 350m
write-down.
BCE's total write-offs for 1993, including CDollars 940m for its share of
Northern Telecom special charges, will total almost CDollars 1.7bn.

FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: French banks to take leading
roles in Euro Disney debt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks have formed an official steering committee to
represent them in the negotiations towards an emergency financial
restructuring package for the ailing leisure group.
The committee, which includes 11 of the 60 international banks that own Euro
Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.45bn) net debt, plans next week to meet
representatives of Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, in
order to begin discussions over the restructuring.
The formation of the steering committee should enable the restructuring
negotiations to get under way. 'This is going to be a very tense,
complicated affair,' said one of the members. 'The sooner we start talking
to Disney in earnest the better.'
Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, the French banks, will take
leading roles in the steering committee.
BNP is the head of the 1989 banking syndicate that provided loans to Euro
Disney to finance the construction of the Euro Disneyland theme park.
Indosuez led a second syndicate in 1991 which lent money to build the park's
hotels.
The other French banks on the steering committee are Credit Agricole and
Credit National. Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French financial
institution will also be involved, although it is negotiating independently
with the Disney camp over the terms of its FFr4.8bn fixed interest rate
loans.
JP Morgan and Citibank, the powerful US banking groups, are also represented
on the committee: as are Deutsche Bank of Germany, Barclays and National
Westminster of the UK and LTCB of Japan.
Walt Disney, advised by Lazards in New York, last month laid out its case to
the creditor banks at a special meeting in Paris. It hopes to halve Euro
Disney's debt to around FFr10bn by persuading the banks to exchange part of
their loans for equity and by staging a rights issue.
However, the banks are anxious to ensure that Walt Disney will play its part
in alleviating the financial strain on Euro Disney, which is advised by SG
Warburg in London.
The steering committee is next week expected to table proposals for Disney
to reduce its royalty entitlement from Euro Disney.

FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: Hoogovens share issue set to
raise Fl 330m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoogovens, the Dutch aluminium and steel group, has priced its issue of 8.3m
new shares at Fl 40 (Dollars 21) each to raise about Fl 330m towards
bolstering its balance sheet.
The retail phase of the two-phase offer opened yesterday and is due to close
on Tuesday. If demand is heavy, some shares earmarked for institutional
investors and the Dutch state will be clawed back for sale to private
investors.
The first phase of the offer, a private placement of shares with
institutions and the Dutch state, was oversubscribed when it closed on
Thursday night.
The company said the institutional placement had achieved a good spread
between the Netherlands and overseas investors but it gave no further
details.
The state's participation could raise the national government's stake in
Hoogovens to a maximum of around 17 per cent from the current 12.3 per cent.
However, the decision by the city of Amsterdam to sell its 5 per cent stake
in Hoogovens to institutional investors in the summer means overall
ownership by public authorities will be no higher than it was before.

FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pricing crucial for Credito
Italiano - Prospects for Italy's first big privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 4pm this afternoon, potential shareholders in Credito Italiano, Italy's
seventh biggest bank, will learn how much the government expects them to pay
for the 840m shares being put on the block in the country's first big
privatisation.
Making the Credito Italiano flotation a cast-iron success is essential for
the credibility of Italy's long-delayed privatisation programme.
A keen price for Credito Italiano is a must for many reasons. In spite of
the L10bn (Dollars 5.8m) advertising budget and an unprecedented selling
campaign, next Monday's opening day of the flotation is far from ideally
timed in view of the difficulties facing the bank and the Italian economy.
This year will be one of the toughest on record for the banking sector.
Analysts expect heavy provisions on loans to recession-hit industry and a
squeeze on margins because of falling interest rates. Large rises in
fee-related income thanks to the buoyant stock and bond markets will counter
the impact, but profits will remain subdued.
Credito Italiano is heavily exposed to some of Italy's most serious
corporate crises, notably Ferruzzi, as well other prominent rescue
candidates. Ominously, the draft prospectus warns: 'Provisions for possible
loan losses in 1993 will be much higher than in 1992 and exceed amounts
deductable for tax purposes.'
The less than ideal timing, coming before even preliminary 1993 figures for
the bank are released, is accentuated by the turbulent political climate.
Next week, the sparks are likely to fly in Rome as parliament gets to grips
with the 1994 budget.
General elections are expected to follow before long. The poll, forecast for
early next year, will mark a crucial step towards the renewal of Italy's
political class, largely discredited by corruption scandals.
In the meantime, the stock market will remain a hostage to any of a thousand
imponderables on the political front.
Credito Italiano's privatisation is also a pace-setter for other deals over
the next two years. In February, the treasury is to sell up to 30 per cent
of Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Rome-based financial services group.
That will be followed within weeks by the flotation of IRI's majority stake
in Banca Commerciale Italiana, another big bank, and by a first tranche of
the Ina state insurance group.
If all goes to plan, 1994 will close with the privatisation of a stake in
the Enel electricity generating authority.
This week, the treasury appointed Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, and
Merrill Lynch of the US as global co-ordinators for the deal. The year after
should see the privatisation of the Stet telecommunications group and most
of the energy assets of the Eni energy and chemicals concern.
A successful sale of Credito Italiano's shares would set the tone for
subsequent transactions.
'If investors find themselves with a tidy premium, they'll obviously be more
likely to put up money for the other deals,' notes one experienced UK public
relations man advising the treasury.
By contrast, a flop would cast a shadow over the entire privatisation
process. Many investors recall the March 1992 flotation of an initial 20 per
cent of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Turin bank. After
trading briefly at a premium, the shares soon fell below the issue price and
have not recovered since.
The need for a success is accentuated by Italy's extremely tight timetable
for privatisation. IMI is due to make its debut barely two months after
Credito Italiano and BCI will follow within weeks. 'Investors will have to
have exceptionally short memories to prevent them being influenced by a
Credito Italiano flop. The treasury has got very little margin for error,'
says one Milan analyst.
To some extent, matters are outside the government's control. The political
scenario is so strewn with potential booby-traps that trying to steer round
them appears pointless to many. Further signs of polarisation in voting
patterns in Sunday's mayorial run-off elections; a surge in support for the
neo-fascist MSI party; or inflammatory statements from the autonomist
Northern Leagues could all give investors a fright and set the bourse
tumbling.
At least Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left,
(the former Communists), which performed strongly in last month's partial
municipal elections, has pledged to support the government in getting the
1994 budget through parliament.
Given the risks, the treasury may veer towards generosity in pricing Credito
Italiano. This week, the marketing machine has moved into full swing, with
plentiful hints that the offer will be oversubscribed. Were Italy on its
10th privatisation, ministers could afford to be tough on pricing. In the
circumstances, discretion may be the better part of valour.

FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sweden to privatise state forest
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday unveiled its biggest privatisation to date when it
announced plans to raise between SKr5bn (Dollars 588m) and SKr8bn from the
sale of a 49 per cent stake in a new grouping of state forestry interests.
It also signalled it was aiming to sell off Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals
group which used to be part of Procordia, in May or June next year.
This probably means that plans to privatise two other state-owned groups,
Nordbanken and the electricity giant Vattenfall, will be deferred beyond
next September's general election.
The forestry company, which will be one of Europe's top 10 pulp and paper
groups, has a market value of between SKr10bn and SKr16bn, according to Mr
Per Westerberg, the Swedish industry minister.
It will be privatised in the spring, once three existing forestry groups -
Assi, Doman and Ncb - have been combined. Assi and Doman, both 100 per cent
state-owned, are to combine at the year-end before making an all-share bid
for Ncb, in which the state holds 51 per cent, in February or March.
Most of the shares in the group are to be offered to the Swedish public.
This follows heavy criticism of Sweden's last privatisation when the public
offered to buy 80m shares in the defence group Celsius, more than 17 times
the 4.6m shares allotted to them.
The new group will have annual sales of SKr15bn making it nearly as big as
MoDo, Sweden's third largest forestry company. It will be Sweden's largest
forest owner and its biggest producer of sawn timber products.
Pharmacia, the next privatisation candidate, is Sweden's second largest
pharmaceuticals group after Astra. It is 46 per cent state-owned, after
Volvo and the government, Procordia's main owners, agreed to divide the
company last month.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat shareholders approve rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greycoat won a new lease of life yesterday when shareholders overwhelmingly
approved an Pounds 86m rescue plan presented by South African financiers,
the UK Active Value Fund.
The agreement came just one week before trustees of the property company's
zero coupon bond holders were due to pull the plug.
Greycoat is now believed to be preparing an approach to work with Postel,
the suitor whose Pounds 120m rescue plan investors rejected in October.
Greycoat is thought to be seeking to implement some of the ideas discussed
with Postel as part of its original rescue package. There has been some
speculation that in the longer term, the pension fund group might join
Greycoat on the Paternoster Square development, near St Paul's Cathedral in
London, among other sites. Postel also has a Pounds 2.3bn property portfolio
it is keen to exploit.
In the past, Postel has developed its property through joint ventures. Such
a strategy would suit the revived Greycoat, which will in future seek to
fund its developments on a project by project basis.
Greycoat is expected to set up joint ventures, where it would provide the
site and/or development expertise. Financing would come from joint venture
partners. Postel's strength lies on the financing side, with a Pounds 23bn
fund at its disposal.
Neither party would comment on such a proposal. Mr Alaistair Ross Goobey,
chief executive of Postel, said yesterday he was not bitter about the
decision by shareholders to accept the UKAV offer over his own.
Mr Geoffrey Wilson, Greycoat's chairman, said the company was now 'back on a
completely sound financial footing'.
Each of the group's four classes of stakeholder voted in favour of the
financial restructuring which will result in a 37 per cent reduction in
borrowings to Pounds 234.5m, raise Pounds 86m before expenses and remove the
breaches of covenant which threatened to sink the group. The deal also
allows preference holders to convert all or part of their shareholding into
ordinary shares.
Postel is expected to have a stake of about 8.5 per cent in the company
after the rescue deal. The other two largest shareholders will be UKAV,
which will have between 22 per cent and 48 per cent, and Schroders.

Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail is
expected to go for a stock market flotation in the spring.
The management buy-out team, led by chief executive Mr Chris Oakley, which
acquired the titles from Mr Ralph Ingersoll in November 1991 for Pounds
125m, has made it clear the group would float when the timing was right.
One factor standing in the way of a float was fears that Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor of the exchequer, would impose VAT on newspapers in this
week's Budget.

Shares in YRM fell a further 2p to 19p yesterday after the building design
consultancy announced that its results for the six months to October 31

It said that trading conditions had remained extremely difficult and further
cost and overhead reductions had accordingly been made.
On Thursday the shares shed 8p, which the company said it understood was the
result of a small volume of selling in the market.
For the year to April 30 YRM incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.98m.

Adare Printing, the Dublin-based printing group, more than doubled pre-tax
profits to IPounds 419,000 (Pounds 407,000) on turnover of IPounds 12.6m in
the half year ended October 31. Profits last time amounted to IPounds
175,000 on sales of IPounds 4.58m.
The results included a three month contribution from Waddington Business
Forms, acquired in July.
Mr Denis Bergin, chairman, said the profits growth was held back by initial
costs of developing and streamlining the acquisitions. He said further
restructuring would take place and the acquisition search would continue.
The interim dividend is lifted to 0.945p (0.9p), payable from earnings per

Umeco, the USM-quoted aerospace components distributor and maker of aircraft
refuellers, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 154,000
for the six months to September 25.
The improvement was achieved on turnover up by Pounds 451,000 to Pounds

The directors said that the raising of Pounds 1.04m earlier in the year had
left the group with net assets of Pounds 3.5m and net cash of Pounds 500,000
after a term loan of Pounds 375,000 at the end of the half.
As a result Umeco had interest receivable of Pounds 5,000 in the period

interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p.

Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.1m were announced by Explaura Holdings
for the half year to June 30. Losses last time for the USM-quoted company,
which quarries limestone aggregates in Newfoundland, Canada, were Pounds

However, following the settlement in September of the strike which hit the
concrete industry in New York, record daily sales were being achieved and
the terminal was operating at maximum capacity.

Consideration will be met via Pounds 7.3m in ordinary shares with the

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dares Ests agrees refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dares Estates, the property investment and development group, has reached
agreement with its principal lenders for a restructuring of its banking
arrangements.
The deal, which is subject to shareholders' approval, also involves a
reorganisation of the company's share capital.
Under the terms of the agreement, the main creditors will convert a
proportion of the debt into preference shares and extend the maturity date
of the balance.
At a later date the new preference shares will be convertible into ordinary
equity, which if fully taken up, would give lenders some 39 per cent of the
enlarged share capital.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Lossmaking Ossory unveils rescue package
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ossory Estates yesterday unveiled proposals for a financial restructuring, a
placing and open offer to raise Pounds 8m net and the acquisition of a
portfolio of properties.
The company also estimated that pre-tax losses for the year to end-June
would total not more than Pounds 41m. That included a write-off of
investments amounting to Pounds 22m, the writing down of properties under
development totalling Pounds 2m and interest and other charges accounting
for Pounds 16.2m.
The directors believed the restructuring proposals represented the 'only
realistic prospect' for shareholders obtaining any value from their holdings
of ordinary shares.
They warned that if the proposals were not implemented and no alternative
proposal put forward Ossory would be unable to continue trading with the
result that it would have no alternative other than 'insolvent liquidation,
administration or receivership'.
The placing and open offer would involve the issue of 835m new ordinary 1p
shares at 1p each. The maximum number of shares available for subscription
under the open offer would be 408m with clawback terms of 9 new ordinary 1p
shares for every two 25p shares held.
The 25p shares would then be sub-divided into one new 1p share and one 24p
deferred share. Following the reorganisation the Pounds 73m deficit on the
profit and loss account would be reduced to about Pounds 25m via the
cancellation of the deferred shares and the share premium account.
The acquisition is of six commercial and industrial properties for Pounds
2.83m in cash and shares.
The shares closed 1p lower at 1 3/4p.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bombardier deal tied to success of Channel
tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bombardier, a Canadian supplier of trains for the Channel tunnel, is to
receive some Pounds 190m in compensation from Transmanche Link, the main
contractor, to cover the cost of design changes it had to make.
The boards of the two companies and of Eurotunnel, the operator of the
cross-Channel link, yesterday gave their formal approval to a preliminary
agreement reached at the end of last month.
The agreement has been designed to link payments with the success of the
project and to tie Bombardier into the start of services through the tunnel.
ESC Wagons, the company set up by Bombardier to build the trains, will
receive FFr700m (Pounds 80m) in phased cash payments and up to 25m new
Eurotunnel shares. At the closing price of 463p, a rise of 8p, last Friday
these shares would be worth Pounds 116m, making a total payment of Pounds
196m.
'This agreement ties the fortunes of Bombardier to the fortunes of
Eurotunnel,' Mr Andre Benard and Sir Alastair Morton, chairmen of
Eurotunnel, said in a statement.
The cash payments will be phased over the period during which the trains are
delivered, while Bombardier has agreed not to sell any Eurotunnel shares
until all the trains which it is supplying have been commissioned.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Barclays acquire Southend Property stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Barclay brothers, the reclusive property developers and publishing
entrepreneurs, have taken a 12.4 per cent stake in Southend Property in part
payment for one of their investment vehicles.
Twins Mr Frederick and Mr David Barclay have agreed to sell Trenport
Properties, a wholly-owned subsidiary of their Ellerman Investments company,
to Southend for Pounds 31m.
Southend said yesterday that the Barclays were taking 13.3m new ordinary
shares of 5p each, while the remainder of the purchase price would be met
with Pounds 12m in cash and Pounds 7m from the issue of Pounds 6.19m of
convertible unsecured loan stock.
Mr Michael Hickey of Paribas, the brokers overseeing the transaction, said
negotiations with the Monaco-based Barclays began last summer in the south
of France, where Southend chairman Mr Malcolm Dagul owns a property.
The Barclays are thought to have been seeking a buyer for some time for
Trenport, which they bought for an undisclosed sum in 1988 from Bond
Corporation, the former vehicle of bankrupt Australian businessman Mr Alan
Bond.
Welcoming the Barclays' shareholding, Mr Dagul said the brothers had
undertaken to retain their stake as a medium-term investment and he was
hopeful of 'other deals' with them.
He said that the addition of Trenport's three properties in Birmingham,
London and Godalming would increase the size of Southend's portfolio by 15
per cent.
Together the properties - totalling 250,000 sq ft of office and leisure
space - are expected to generate rental income of Pounds 2.9m next year.
'We see a lot of potential in these properties and this transaction could
lead to further acquisitions,' he said.
Southend was able to seek new acquisitions because it had built up cash
balances of Pounds 40m from property sales and a loan stock issue in June,
he added.
The company, meanwhile, also announced an increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 1.78m for the six months to September 30.
The results were achieved on reduced turnover of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds
18.2m). Earnings increased to 1.23p (0.67p), while the interim dividend is
reduced from 1.52p to 0.8p.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti job losses played down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The receivers to Ferranti International, the UK-based defence electronics
group which collapsed on Wednesday, yesterday played down suggestions that
up to 14 per cent of the worldwide workforce may lose their jobs.
In plans drawn up by management in advance of the company's collapse after
the General Electric Company withdrew its takeover bid, 500 employees of the
3,600 workforce were being considered for redundancies.
The team of more than 60 receivers from accountants Arthur Andersen have
been holding meetings with union representatives to prepare them for
possible job losses. Most of the losses would be in the UK, which has a
workforce of about 3,000.
However, Mr John Talbot, one of the joint receivers and head of insolvency
at Andersen, said: 'We are optimistic about the group and the ability to
sell many businesses as going concerns.'
He said he had received 'lots of expressions of interest' from possible
buyers of Ferranti businesses, but that he would not be considering any
serious offers until after he had completed more detailed investigations and
developed a strategy for the company's future.
Sales of some parts of the group would need clearance from the Ministry of
Defence because many contracts are for highly sensitive military equipment.
A number of companies within the Ferranti group are continuing to trade and
have not entered receivership, including the joint ventures and most of its
overseas operations.
Mr Talbot also confirmed suggestions that he would consider demanding more
money from customers on any lossmaking contracts Ferranti was currently
undertaking. He said it was 'quite possible' that some customers had already
been approached to discuss the position.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke postpones FID decision - Long
handover period has led to confusion about future direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ladbroke group is believed to have drawn back from its announcement
earlier this week that it would definitely take advantage of the new foreign
income dividend scheme.
The group is thought to have decided to postpone a final decision on whether
to make use of the scheme until it has had time to discuss the matter with
its shareholders.
Ladbroke announced last Wednesday that it would take advantage of the
foreign income dividend (FID) scheme when paying its 1993 final dividend in
early July 1994. The announcement was one of the factors which led to the
group's share price falling from 171 1/2 p at the start of trading on
Wednesday to 145p yesterday.
Using the scheme would result in a significant loss to pension fund
investors because FIDs, unlike conventional dividends, do not carry a 20 per
cent tax credit which tax-exempt investors can reclaim.
The confusion over whether or not Ladbroke had made a final decision on FIDs
appears to arise from a senior management hiatus at the group, following the
announcement last September that Mr Cyril Stein, the veteran chairman, was
to retire. Mr John Jackson, the new chairman, and Mr Peter George, the new
chief executive, do not formally take up their positions until January 1.
The long handover period has led to some uncertainty as to the group's
future direction.
The revelation this week that discussions were taking place over the future
of Mr Michael Hirst, head of the Hilton International hotels subsidiary, is
believed to have arisen from the same confusion.
Mr Hirst is regarded as an outstanding hotel operator but the group had
decided that a new senior manager was needed to work alongside him to
exploit one of the world's best-known brand names.
While discussions were going on, Mr Hirst sold 125,000 Ladbroke shares. The
group said Mr Hirst sold the shares for personal reasons. The sale was
announced on Budget day, four days after it had taken place. This created
the impression that the group was trying to hide the share sale and also
forced a premature announcement that discussions were taking place about his
future.
The new leadership at Ladbroke is expected to take steps to improve its
communication with investors and the press in an attempt to avoid such
mishaps. It is thought that many in the group now accept that its
traditional reticence has led outsiders to assume the worst about its
fortunes.
Among other changes likely to take place is a more active property disposal
programme.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Resignations called for at Bristol Scotts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gloves are off in the battle for control at Bristol Scotts, the stadium
and restaurant group wracked by shareholder dissent, writes Peggy Hollinger.
Mr Ian Stevens, head of the company's pubs division, whose family own just
over 20 per cent of the shares, yesterday called for the resignation from
the board of three members of the Kerman family, which has controlled the
company for decades. Mr Stevens made the call in a letter to the company in
which he withdrew an earlier request for an EGM to vote on appointing
himself and fellow shareholder Sir Ian Rankin to the board.
He has requisitioned a second EGM at which he proposes to remove Mr Anthony
Kerman and Mr Nicholas Kerman, directors, and Mr Isidore Kerman, chairman.
He has called for the resignation of company solicitors, Forsyte Kerman, and
again proposed the appointment of himself and Sir Ian.
Meanwhile, the High Court is expected to rule on Monday on the voting status
of 830,000 Bristol Scott shares - 12 per cent of the company - sold by Mr
Nicholas Kerman to the investment vehicle Mayfair Capital which sold them on
to Mr Nicholas Berry. The Kermans are claiming to have an option to buy the
shares back from Mayfair. Mr Berry has said that if allowed to vote he will
vote for the appointment of Mr Stevens and Sir Ian.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bokaemper to head Forte hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte has appointed Mr Stefan Bokaemper, a senior executive with
Inter-Continental Hotels, to head its luxury hotels division.
The appointment of Mr Bokaemper follows Forte's failure earlier this year to
persuade Mr Willi Bauer, former general manager of the Savoy Hotel, to take
the job. Mr Bauer said the post would have involved too much travelling.
Mr Bokaemper is currently Inter-Continental's executive vice-president in
the Asia-Pacific region. He has been with the company for 26 years and will
become managing director of Forte's exclusive hotels division. This is made
up of 16 hotels, including the Hyde Park Hotel in London, the George V in
Paris, the Ritz in Madrid and the Sandy Lane in Barbados.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chairman, has said he would like to merge the
division with the Savoy group's hotels. Forte holds a majority of the
Savoy's shares but a minority of voting shares.
Forte is also in talks to take over the management of Ciga, the
Italian-based luxury hotels group.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Betterware shares fall on boardroom changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Betterware fell 10p to 148p yesterday as the home shopping company
announced the appointment of a new finance director to replace Mr Terry
Hockley, who is to lead the group's expansion overseas.
The shares have fallen from a six month high of 278p in recent months. The
decline has been fuelled by the downgrading of 1994 annual profits after
increased interims, decisions by the founding Cohen family to reduce its
holding from 63.4 per cent to 50.3 per cent at a price of 230p a share, and
a large overhang of stock.
The company stressed that Mr Hockley had been 'promoted to international
director'. Betterware, which is facing a mature market in the UK, is seeking
to expand in Europe. It entered the French market about two years ago, Spain
earlier this year, and plans to set up in Germany next year.
Mr Hockley, who has been Betterware's finance director since 1990, had
'extensive international experience over many years', the company said,
including US multi-nationals Textron, Burlington and United Technologies.
Mr Peter Hartley, former finance director and subsequently managing director
of Texas Homecare, will succeed Mr Hockley. Mr Hartley, a chartered
accountant, left Texas in July.
Mr Andrew Cohen, Betterware chief executive, said Mr Hartley's appointment
'adds further strength to our board and allows Terry to concentrate on our
continuing thrust into the European market.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Asda disposes of Allied to Carpetland in
equity deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda has sold its Allied business to Carpetland in a deal that will create
the biggest carpet retailer in the UK.
Under the deal, Asda has subscribed for Pounds 8m of ordinary shares in
Carpetland, which was acquired from the Lowndes Queensway receivers in a
Pounds 12m management buy-out in 1991. This will give Asda an initial 40 per
cent equity interest in the enlarged group, which will have 200 stores and
be renamed Allied.
Asda's interest in the group can be increased to not more than 50 per cent,
depending on the realisation value of Carpetland on a flotation or trade
sale.
Asda, the UK's fourth largest grocery chain, has emerged from severe
financial difficulties at the end of the 1980s determined to concentrate on
its core business.
Mr Archie Norman, chief executive, described the disposal as 'a problem
solved. Allied has been in decline for a number of years and threatened
further losses.'
In the last two financial years the Allied business, which has soaked up
more than Pounds 100m of investment since the late 1980s, incurred operating
losses totalling Pounds 17.7m.
Carpetland made operating profits of Pounds 771,000 on turnover of Pounds
54.5m in the 12 months to the end of January. Mr Ray Nethercott, managing
director, said that this year, before the acquisition, the company had been
expecting profits of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 80m. 'Business has been
flying in the last 12 months,' he said.
Mr Nethercott stated that there was 'real commercial logic' in the deal.
The combined group would have turnover of about Pounds 200m a year. He
expected to have the group showing healthy profits in 18 months through cost
saving measures, particularly on marketing and advertising. He hoped to
bring the company to market 'within three years.'
As part of the deal, CINVen, the venture capital group and existing majority
shareholder in Carpetland, is subscribing for Pounds 5m of 12 1/2 per cent
preference shares and Asda is subscribing Pounds 10m of 12 1/2 per cent
redeemable loan stock.
In the profit and loss account Asda will take a write-off of about Pounds
70m, mainly reflecting the total book value of its historic investment in
Allied and Maples. It will also make a charge of Pounds 53.3m goodwill.
Mr Norman, who joined Asda 20 months ago, said he was pleased with the deal,
which took another distraction away from management. Asda's debt had fallen
from Pounds 700m to well below Pounds 100m since he joined. He expected to
sell the 20 remaining Maples stores, 'within the next two months.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Carpet distribution a 'jungle'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carpet distribution in the UK 'has been described as a jungle', according to
a recent report from Mintel, the market research organisation. It is 'highly
fragmented with a large number of independent retailers and a small number
of multiple operators', writes David Blackwell.
Allied Maples was the largest single outlet, followed by Carpetright, with
116 stores and a turnover of about Pounds 78m in the year to end-May.
Carpetright was set up in 1988 by Sir Philip Harris, former chairman of
Harris Queensway, with MFI, and was floated on the Stock Exchange last June.
An estimated 9,500 outlets sold floor coverings last year, including just
over 6,000 independent retailers. About 2,200 stores were owned by
multiples, with the remaining 1,300 belonging to voluntary buying groups
such as AIS, Floreat and Green Group, as well as department stores and DIY
sheds.
Mintel estimates that retail sales this year of machine made rugs and
carpets will reach Pounds 1.35bn, up from last year's Pounds 1.3bn but still
below the peak of Pounds 1.5bn in 1989. The market has been affected by
fragile demand and price discounting which has curbed margins for both
manufacturers and retailers.
The multiples deal direct with producers, and have the upper hand. The
independent retailer either buys from a carpet wholesaler or belongs to a
voluntary buying group. Wholesalers distribute 30 per cent of carpets and
are reliant on the performance of the independent sector.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: ICI in talks over sale of US arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries is in talks to sell its Arizona-based Fiberite
Composites Business, the last significant legacy of the UK chemical giant's
unsuccessful venture into advanced materials.
ICI said market rumours had forced it to announce the possible disposal. If
and when a deal was concluded, it would involve the writedown of about
Pounds 100m, including Pounds 77m of purchased goodwill. However, ICI
refused to identify the prospective buyer or the price. The shares closed 7p
lower at 761p.
Fiberite, which employs about 800 people in the US and several dozen in
Germany, produces thermo-set materials in their unfinished state, or
pre-pregs.
Fiberite was bought in 1984 as part of ICI's Dollars 750m acquisition of
Beatrice Chemical of the US. Pre-pregs, made of woven carbon fibres and
resin, are used to make aeroplane parts such as tail fins and wing flaps.
ICI decided to get out of advanced materials before the restructuring
process which saw the hiving off of its pharmaceuticals arm earlier this
year to create Zeneca. ICI said yesterday: 'Advanced materials have not
fulfilled the growth potential we saw in them in the 1980s.'
Analysts said ICI was at a competitive disadvantage in the manufacture of
pre-pregs because it had to buy most of the feedstocks from rival chemical
groups.
One said ICI produced a insignificant proportion of the added value in
thermo-set, so the intrinsic profitability was small.
Fiberite last year made an operating loss of Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds
94m.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Few ladies in red: Women in Russian politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Alevtina Fedulova is the best Russia can offer as a female leader with
the kind of clout once held by Mrs Thatcher. Blonde and articulate, she
hopes to make big political advances for women as leader of the country's
first party dedicated to female rights. In next weekend's parliamentary
elections, Women of Russia is putting up 44 female candidates for the
450-seat State Duma.
Mrs Fedulova has a reputation as a formidable operator. Under the old
Communist regime she headed the Pioneer youth organisation, which ran
holiday camps for millions of children, where Marxist-Leninist values were
mixed with games and music lessons.
This experience is both a disadvantage as well as a plus. Her background as
a pillar of a Communist regime that did little to advance women's well-being
means female voters, eager for a greater voice in Russian politics and
society, are reluctant to support her. She admits the Communists 'proclaimed
rights which were never applied in practice'.
It is ironic that Mrs Fedulova finds herself the founder of Women of Russia
 -and it is a sign of the difficulties women's rights activists have had in
organising themselves in a fledgling democracy.
So far, few women have been able to gain the experience necessary to form
parties.
The problem is not new. Equality between the sexes, promised by the
Bolsheviks in 1917, meant, in practice, that many women were forced to work
in heavy industry and other traditional male jobs but still to carry the
burden of domestic duties.
As a result, Women of Russia seeks to appeal to women voters through largely
pragmatic issues - for instance, pledging to give women the option of
staying at home and stressing the importance of improved healthcare. It
talks about bringing 'feminine qualities' - meaning reliability and
tenderness - into Russia's male-dominated political arena.
The party is unique in trying to turn women's rights into a political issue
 -even though females account for 75 per cent of the unemployed and abortion
remains the most common form of birth-control. The concerns of most other
political parties revolve around the threat of a declining birth rate to
Russia's influence as a world power and promises of improving health care.
One exception - Russia's Choice, the party set up by young radical reformers
in the Russian government - has put Ms Ella Pamfilova, the social welfare
minister, at number three on the party list used in the system of
proportional representation. But in spite of her popularity, most women
activists regard her selection as a token gesture.
Similarly, Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the economist, has promised that the
radical alliance he leads would try to pilot an equal opportunities law
through the new parliament.
The pervasive indifference is due largely to the lack of pressure from
women. Many blame themselves for the dominance of men in Russian society and
politics. 'We spoil our men,' explains Mrs Natalya Starkova, a 60-year-old
English-language teacher at Moscow University. 'They are accustomed to
expecting Russian women to go out to work, to do everything at home and to
look pretty for them in the evening.' Women made up less than 6 per cent of
the last Russian parliament - against a third under the Soviet regime.
Politicians' wives traditionally stay in the background. Mrs Raisa
Gorbachev, the only Soviet leader's wife to venture into the limelight,
became unpopular because of her aloof image and taste for foreign clothes.
President Boris Yeltsin has tried to avoid the same problem, keeping Mrs
Naina Yeltsin behind the scenes. Not one candidate's wife has appeared on
the campaign trail or posters.
Olga, the 36-year-old wife of Arkady Murashov, a leading candidate for
Russia's Choice, says politicians' wives could play a more prominent role
'if things are done well, not like Mrs Gorbachev'.
The result of the relative sidelining of women is that the elections are
unlikely to advance their cause. Nor are they likely to help themselves in
Russia's first democratic election.
Many believe that supporting Women of Russia would be to waste their vote
when economic reform as advanced by Russia's Choice is more important at
this stage in Russia's history.
'I'm all for getting more women into parliament,' says Mrs Starkova, who
plans to vote for Russia's Choice. 'But this time the main task is to fix
our economy and Women of Russia can't do this.'
Mrs Valentina Konstantinova, one of Russia's few self-proclaimed feminists,
says women must first increase their self-esteem before putting other women
into parliament.
A few others are running as independents with an emphasis on women's rights.
Mrs Fedulova agrees women themselves are part of the problem. Her task is to
convince them of their strength.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: The child as a thinker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms DIANA SCHOMBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, After all the recent hand-wringing and talk of moral teaching how
refreshing to read Christian Tyler's interview with Karin Murris in which
she stresses the importance of teaching children to think (Private View,
November 27/28).
Towards the end of my teaching career in a south London school the thing
that depressed me most was the growing mindlessness among pupils - a kind of
animality, so unthinking that it often led to self-induced injury, as well
as harm to others. Children lived in a dream world of pop and pap, aware
only of the values inculcated by trivia and video nasties. How can anyone
instil morality until such children learn to think clearly.
In contrast, the article by John Willman in the same issue ('Things can be
done: hand-wringing over the James Bulger case is misplaced') was
faint-hearted and unimaginative. Even if there is not enough money for
universal provision, at least we could provide it for priority areas. Having
done so, we must make sure that the very best teachers are appointed to work
in them. They could make a tremendous difference to a child's future (partly
because problem children - and families - would be spotted earlier).
By primary school age the damage has been left too long unchecked.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Road tolls: excise option more
efficient and fairness essential to their success (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEFFREY ROSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Budget announcement that the government has decided to go ahead
with motorway charging as soon as the electronic technology is ready almost
certainly defers implementation of any such scheme until after the next
general election. However, it does not defer the need to continue efforts to
ensure that charging, when it comes, is both sensible and fair.
Once again, it seems probable that the intransigence of the Treasury will
turn out to be the main obstacle. Charging can be made acceptable to the
motorist only if the money raised is committed to spending on the road
network; is additional to current road investment; and there is a
realignment of other motoring taxes to make introduction of a charging
system fair and not unduly onerous.
If the Treasury cannot accept direct hypothecation of revenue from user
charges then the motorist will resent motorway charging. An unfair system
will have 'poll tax potential', and could backfire on the government. The
UK's 35m motorists make up a significant proportion of the electorate and
will not accept a proposal that is grossly unfair. The Treasury should look
to the future and radically review its own rules, which look increasingly
like outdated dogma.
For those concerned about provision of a road network on which the economy
will remain hugely dependent, the battle over the coming months must be to
secure a fundamental Treasury reappraisal.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From G W GODDIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Transport secretary John MacGregor ('Motorway charges put on hold until
after election', November 26) will be doing very well to develop a scheme
for electronic road tolls by 1998. Quite apart from the little matter of the
election, there is the total antipathy (initially apparent in the 'Traffic
in Towns' report, 1964) of the department of transport and of road lobbies
to any kind of direct charging of motorists for road use.
At present the only 'usage tax' (ie, related to road use, not ownership) is
fuel excise duty at some Pounds 1.20 per gallon - that is, 6p to 3p per mile
for large to small cars. To equate to typical EU toll levels and city public
transport charges this direct charge ought to be three to four times higher.
Thus Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is to be congratulated for embarking
on this route, for excise duty tolls are not only cheap to collect and hard
to avoid, they also have formidable effects on fuel efficiency and
pollution, and they surcharge congestion.
Mr Clarke's excise tolls are far superior to Mr MacGregor's electronic tolls
which, given the negligible R&amp;D pursued by the transport department so far,
could easily remain unsuitable as a means of charging for direct road use
for a very long time.

FT  04 DEC 93 / The curse of Gyllenhammar: Kevin Done and John Ridding sift
through the wreckage of the failed merger between Renault and Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar is leaving Volvo for the wilderness like a baleful Old
Testament prophet cursing his people. Left in isolation by his shareholders
and his senior management, he is prophesying only the apocalypse for his
abandoned flock.
The Volvo organisation is 'crushed', the company 'wounded'. The critics of
his vision are guilty of 'turning their backs on Europe and the world' and
have 'reduced the probability of Volvo's long-term survival'.
The rejection of a full merger of Renault and Volvo's automotive operations
was also a rejection of all that had been achieved in the last three years
of alliance between the Swedish and French automakers, he claimed.
In his most damning imprecation Mr Gyllenhammar warned: 'The alliance will
not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management which has lost its
confidence in Volvo. To dissolve the alliance will require time, energy and
will be demoralising.'
Yesterday Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault and the man who shared Mr
Gyllenhammar's vision for building Europe's second-largest vehicle maker,
was understandably more cautious. 'The industrial agreement signed with
Volvo in 1990 remains in force. It is not threatened by the failure of the
merger,' he insisted. 'But the dynamism has been lost. We have to look with
sangfroid at what we do now. We will examine our projects on a case by case
basis.'
In reality the choices facing Mr Schweitzer - and Mr Gyllenhammar's
successors at Volvo - are bleak. The challenges and threats in the fiercely
competitive global automotive industry, which first encouraged the two
companies to look at merger as a road to survival in the next century,
remain.
The world's car and commercial vehicle makers are haunted by overcapacity,
minimal growth in demand, continuous upward pressure on product development
costs, increasing price competition, and the need to overhaul radically
their components and materials supplier bases in order to reduce components
costs.
To make matters worse, the auto industry is still caught in the worst
recession in Europe and Japan of the postwar era. Much of the industry is in
loss, and those parts still in profit are scarcely making enough money to
support the demands for ever increasing investment.
Instead of confronting these external threats Renault and Volvo must now
turn aside and use invaluable management time and resources to unpick their
relationship.
Outright merger had always been the only logical conclusion of the
far-reaching alliance announced by the two companies in 1990 and formalised
with an exchange of large minority cross shareholdings at the beginning of
1991. The two companies must now examine what can be saved from their
collaborative projects, and assess which activities have been rendered
impossible by the breakdown of trust between the organisations, and which
areas may lend themselves to collaboration with other rivals.
Some joint activities will still make sense outside the remit of a full
merger. The world auto industry is a complicated square dance in which the
big players co-operate in some regional markets of the world and compete in
others. The exchange of major components such as engines and gearboxes is
becoming increasingly common.
Renault already supplies engines and transmissions for the Volvo 400 series.
Projects such as this will probably survive.
In doubt, however, will be the future of the ambitious plans that had been
put into place in preparation for full merger. These include the
establishment of common operations for purchasing and quality, the merger of
car marketing and sales organisations in big markets such as Germany, and
the creation of single project teams for the development of new model
ranges, such as the joint executive car planned for the end of the decade to
replace the Volvo 800/900 series and the Renault Safrane.
If a full divorce occurs, it would leave the Volvo car operations looking
particularly exposed. Mr John Longhurst, automotive analyst for UBS, warned
that Volvo's shareholders had won 'a hollow victory' by stopping the merger.
'Volvo Car will ultimately wither in the absence of the economies of scale
that would only have come from a full merger.'
The development without a partner of the Volvo 850, the Swedish carmaker's
latest new car project, had almost 'broken' Volvo's car division, said Mr
Longhurst. 'Its replacement could finish the job.'
Most industry observers believe that Renault remains in a relatively healthy
position without the merger. 'Volvo needed this merger much more than
Renault,' said one automobile industry analyst in London. Mr Louis
Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, is confident that the car group can remain
profitable throughout the worst downturn in the world automobile industry.
New products are also on the way. At the beginning of next year Renault will
introduce the Laguna to replace the Renault 21. A replacement for the
Renault 19 is also due by 1995.
But the collapse of the merger is still a blow. Renault and Volvo predicted
cost savings of more than FFr30bn (Pounds 3.4bn) by 2000 as a result of
economies of scale in production, combined R&amp;D efforts and joint purchasing
programmes. Renault was also aiming to capitalise on Volvo's strength in
upper-range cars and safety technology.
From Renault's perspective, the merger was particularly important in
commercial vehicles, where Volvo is stronger. 'In the trucks sector, now
more than ever you have size problems,' said Mr Schweitzer. 'R&amp;D costs are
growing rapidly and these are the kind of costs saved by a merger.'
It seems inevitable that the process of picking up the pieces will take
place in a mood of bitterness. Renault said it 'deplored' Volvo's failure to
ratify the merger. 'This is an unpredictable partner,' said Mr Gerard
Longuet, the French industry minister. 'It is a missed opportunity for
European industry.'
Most troubling for Mr Schweitzer is the state of limbo in which the group
finds itself. 'The alliance with Volvo was meant to lead to a merger and
synergies between the two groups,' said one industry observer. 'Instead
Renault now finds itself with an albatross around its neck.'
Mr Schweitzer has consistently maintained that, without a merger, the
existing co-operation would be jeopardised. 'It has always been a two-stage
process,' he says. 'Co-operation has worked because we were heading towards
a common goal of the merger.'
For the French government, the accord was regarded as a vital step before
the privatisation of its automobile group, one of the most attractive assets
on the list of 21 publicly owned groups slated for sale over the next five
years. Resolving the status of the alliance, and in particular the cross
shareholdings, will be crucial to the privatisation. In January 1991, Volvo
took 20 per cent of the shares in Renault and 45 per cent of the shares in
its trucks and buses division. Renault took 25 per cent of the shares in
Volvo's car operations, 45 per cent of its truck activities and about 10 per
cent of the voting capital in the parent company.
The French government said the failure of the merger did not affect its
intention to privatise the car group, but it could hardly do so soon. 'For
one thing, who would buy shares when the situation is so chaotic?' asked one
merchant banker in Paris. 'Second, the French government must be nervous
about the prospect of having Volvo so prominent in the share register after
everything that has happened.'
The result is likely to be a delay in Renault's privatisation, which may be
welcomed by the government. 'It may now be able to wait for conditions in
the automobile market to improve to maximise its revenues,' said Mr Philippe
Barrier, automobile analyst at Societe Generale, the financial group.
But the state of the car market is hardly the priority for either Renault or
Volvo. Business-as-usual must take a back seat as they struggle to emerge
from the wreckage of the failed merger, with Mr Gyllenhammar's prophecies
ringing in their ears.

<TEXT>
Sir, What an interesting article by John Cuthbert ('Put your trust in
benchmarks', November 27-28). It has become my experience over the years
that the top unit trusts are out there waiting for me to invest. Receipt of
my money is their signal to leap off the cliff into obscurity, cackling
insanely. Their 'health warning' should surely read: 'The value of your
investment may plummet. . .'
But in the end the article disappointed. Unless you (or someone clever like
you) were to publish and maintain a risk/benefit benchmark table along the
lines of that suggested, the average decaying simpleton like me will be no
better off. I hope you will decide to help. In these parts standard
deviations are looked upon with deep suspicion. I don't allow them in the
house, and if I find one in the garden I stamp on it smartly with my green
wellies.

FT  04 DEC 93 / A tonic for Euro-malaise: Lionel Barber on what may be the
final stages of the Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gatt world trade talks have moved decisively into an end-game. Failure
remains possible; but high-level talks in Brussels this week between the US
and the European Union have left the impression that the two powers that can
make or break the negotiations are committed to striking a deal.
On Monday, Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative, aim to unveil an outline agreement on all
outstanding issues, including agriculture. They want to create a bandwagon
effect, sweeping along all 103 countries in the Gatt negotiations in Geneva
so that an agreement can be reached by the agreed deadline of December 15.
It is a hard-sell, high-risk strategy. Much mind-numbing technical work
remains to be done. Many wonder if there is enough time to reach a
comprehensive deal that will persuade Latin American and Asia to climb
aboard.
For the moment the mood is cautiously optimistic. On Thursday night, EU
foreign ministers gave Sir Leon a vote of confidence to make the final
trade-offs to achieve a deal. A few ministers grumbled about a lack of
detail, but French veto threats were absent. 'There is a common approach,
there is enough cohesion, there is confidence in the Com-mission,' said Mr
Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister.
Still, if a final deal is to be struck, many disputes must be resolved. One
of the stickiest is US demands that the Europeans further open their markets
in films and broadcasting. The EU counter-proposals for measures to protect
'cultural specificity' remain unacceptable in their present form.
The US is also hanging tough on textiles and steel; and there is no
agreement on new world trade rules to replace Gatt. One possible solution is
a new Multilateral Trade Organisation which would license the terms under
which members could take action against unfair trading practices.
But the calculation in Brussels and Washington is that the stakes are too
high to countenance failure. 'We have an awesome responsibility,' said Sir
Leon. 'Failure would carry with it the risk of a downward spiral of
protectionism leading to immense damage to the world economy.'
Such rhetoric has echoed through the negotiating corridors regularly since
the Uruguay Round started in 1986; but it is now taken seriously. This is
most true of Europe, where a shift of opinion has taken place as business
and political elites have woken up to the risks of failure.
Big business now realises that Europe missed 'an historic opportunity' in
1990 to conclude a deal at an earlier Gatt meeting in Heysel Stadium,
Brussels, said a leading French businessman. 'They did not push hard because
those were good economic times. Failure would be catastrophic now.'
The fear of the 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policies of protectionism and
competitive currency devaluations reminiscent of the 1930s has galvanised
European industry. While estimates of an annual Dollars 250bn boost to the
world economy are long-range and perhaps exaggerated, business leaders argue
that a deal would deliver a much-needed lift to confidence.
This was a theme in the report 'Beating the Crisis', by the European Round
Table, the business leaders' group, unveiled yesterday in Brussels in the
presence of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. He,
too, has undergone something akin to a conversion on Gatt.
A year ago, Mr Delors was happy to deliver sermons on the plight of the
French peasant and the need to stand up to 'Big Brother' across the
Atlantic. But recently he warned his fellow Frenchmen to snap out of their
'national psychodrama' and to avoid retreating behind a modern-day Maginot
line, the ineffective defence system built between the wars to stop a German
invasion.
The analogy is telling. It suggests that a collapse of the Gatt talks - if
attributable directly to the French government - could crack the
Franco-German alliance which remains the anchor of the European Union,
whatever its present strains.
In this spirit, members of the German Industry Federation have pointed out
to their counterparts in the French Patronat that, since German manufactured
exports account for 13.8 per cent of world manufacturing exports, Germany's
vital interests are at stake in a Gatt deal.
UK officials are equally blunt. They draw a picture of a European Union
split between northern free-traders and a protectionist rump of Latin
countries led by France. The likely result would be a rash of unilateral
actions against cheap imports, the end of a unified EU trade policy, and the
end of the single European market.
The broader concern is that Europe gets caught in a world of managed trade
between blocs. Last month's Apec summit in Seattle was viewed in Brussels as
an implicit threat that the US could gain preferred trading partnerships in
the fast-growing Asian markets. When Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, warned this week that a failure in the Gatt talks would damage the
transatlantic alliance, he was taken seriously.
Similarly, Europeans fear a trading system without established rules and
codes for regulating the subsidising and dumping of exports and settling
trade disputes. It would mean 'a licence to kill', said a senior Commission
official.
This reveals the widespread sense of vulnerability in Europe provoked by the
conflict over the Maastricht treaty, the collapse of the European Monetary
System and now the phenomenon of mass unemployment. A Gatt deal would not be
a miracle cure, but it would restore confidence in Europe's ability to act
collectively on a matter of vital interest.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Safety net, not social insurance: Change, not wholesale
reform, is on the welfare state agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is official: the welfare state is safe in Conservative hands - or so the
government says. After months of speculation about radical reforms -
spur-red on by ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Michael Portillo -
the chancellor sought to lay the issue to rest in his Budget statement on
Tuesday.
'This government will never take part in any attempt to dismantle the
welfare state,' he said. 'We want to see a better welfare state, well-run,
well-judged and one that meets the priorities of modern society.'
That claim is borne out by the detailed measures in the Budget. There was a
tightening up on eligibility for unemployment and invalidity benefits. A new
drive on fraudulent claims was announced. Responsibility for sick pay was
shifted to employers for larger businesses. And the state pension age for
women will rise from 60 to 65 in the second decade of next century.
For all the opposition's sound and fury, this hardly adds up to what Mr John
Smith, Labour leader, called a 'vicious attack on the welfare state'.
Indeed, Mr Clarke took the opportunity to reaffirm his party's support for
the basic state pension, the most expensive social security benefit,
accounting for 10 per cent of public spending.
Mr Portillo, the hawkish chief secretary, may have suggested as recently as
last month the state pension could be phased out for younger people. But the
chancellor took the trouble to say the government was committed to the basic
pension and 'retaining its value'.
And in case it was thought that ministers were picking on lone-parent
families, Mr Clarke introduced a childcare allowance that would help 'tens
of thousands of mothers' go back to work. While acknowledging that this
would benefit married mothers as well, he highlighted the help it would give
single mothers in breaking out of welfare dependency.
Further, the chancellor has secured the agreement of cabinet colleagues for
an end to the sort of talk about fundamental reforms of the welfare state
which might frighten backbenchers and Tory voters. Less will now be heard
about moving from a welfare state to a 'welfare society', as trailed in the
run-up to the Budget by Mr Lilley, the social security secretary.
At the morning cabinet meeting Mr Clarke exerted his political authority by
telling colleagues to tone down their rhetoric. He wanted the welfare state
reformed rather than run down. Others should sing the same tune.
Yet life is not so simple. The welfare state has never been a fixed entity.
It has constantly mutated to meet new challenges during the 50 years since
Sir William Beveridge set out the blueprint for a comprehensive social
security system.
For much of its first 30 years, the welfare state gathered size, creating
new benefits, improving the generosity of payments and extending coverage
beyond those paying national insurance contributions.
Since the late 1970s, however, there has been a series of incremental
changes designed to ratchet down the rising cost of welfare:
Some universal benefits such as maternity grant and death grant have been
abolished (with employers taking over responsibility for maternity
allowance). Unemployment benefit and sickness benefit have become flat-rate
payments, with the elimination of the earnings-related supplements which
used to be paid with them.
Since 1981, benefits have been increased annually in line with prices rather
than earnings.
The state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) has been scaled down to
reduce its cost in the next century as the population ages.
The conditions for claiming most benefits have been tightened - restricting
unemployment benefit to people actively seeking work.
These changes have generally reduced the value of benefits as a proportion
of average earnings, encouraging individuals who can afford it to make
greater private provision. Almost 15m people, for example, have opted out of
Serps into private pension schemes or occupational pension schemes.
The result is that the welfare state plays a declining role in providing
financial security for most people. Instead, it is increasingly becoming a
safety net for those unable to provide for themselves.
This week's Budget measures are a continuation of this trend, with further
changes which will cut costs and encourage greater provision by individuals
and employers.
And while fundamental reforms may be off the immediate political agenda, Mr
Lilley is keen to see the trend continue. He will pursue his efforts to
encourage a debate on the subject with the aim of preparing the public for
more incremental change and persuading them to do more for themselves.
He will be helped in this by the decline in value of benefits now that they
are linked to prices rather than earnings. The basic pension, worth 15 per
cent of average earnings, will fall to about 7 per cent of average earnings
over the next 30 years.
Already two-thirds of people reaching state retirement age have income from
occupational pensions of more than Pounds 56 a week, the amount of the basic
state pension.
As Mr Lilley recently pointed out, the UK is better placed than many other
countries to cope with the strains imposed on the welfare state by an ageing
population. By a series of policy adjustments - undertaken in the case of
Serps long before the problem emerged - Britain has avoided the often
arbitrary cuts other countries have recently introduced.
The announcement that the retirement age for women will be raised starting
in 17 years is a further example of this far-sighted approach, the
chancellor argues.
Certainly the welfare state is not fundamentally changed by the sort of
measures announced this week. But the underlying process of reducing the
demands on social security, of encouraging greater individual provision and
seeking a greater contribution from employers continues.
The outcome of that in the longer term is a welfare state which is more of a
safety net, supporting only those who cannot make their own provision. The
welfare state into which all pay contributions in good times and all draw
out when times are bad withers.
Beveridge might welcome elements of the switch, including the increasing
emphasis on individual responsibility in welfare. But it is a far cry from
the cradle-to-grave social insurance system he envisaged in his 1942 report.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's hairshirt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Masochism has been designated the English vice. Rightly so, it appears from
the ecstatic reaction accorded to the second of two tough budgets in one
year. Lashed by Mr Clarke, the financial markets, the pundits and Tory
backbenchers have gone into paroxysms of delight.
The joy of the gilts markets is understandable. Nothing is better designed
to bring a smile to the lips of the nervous investor in long-term fixed
income securities than the spectacle of depression in the economy and
austerity in the budget. Austerity is what Messrs Lamont and Clarke have
delivered. In 1996-97, taxes are to be Pounds 17bn (2.2 per cent of gross
domestic product) higher than they would have been without the 1993 budgets.
That is what the two chancellors would have obtained if they had raised the
basic rate of tax to 34p in the pound.
Meanwhile spending has been cut by Pounds 3bn (0.4 per cent of GDP) in
1996-97, over and above already tough plans. As the Institute for Fiscal
Studies promptly pointed out, the government intends to allow non-cyclical
public spending to rise by less than 4 per cent in real terms between
1992-93 and 1998-99, a third as fast as in the recovery phase of the last
cycle under Mrs Thatcher.
With Pounds 7bn of underfunding promised as well, it is hardly surprising
that the redemption yield on a medium-term bond fell from 6.68 per cent on
Monday to 6.46 per cent yesterday evening. This comes on top of an extended
bull run, during which the yield has fallen from a peak of 12.7 per cent in
April 1990.
Optimism about inflation is understandable, but what about the soaring
equity market? The FT-A 500 Index has gained 2.6 per cent since Monday
night. Why should budgetary austerity deliver this, especially when the
price-earnings ratio is already barely short of where it was before the
October 1987 crash?
Conventional wisdom is that low interest rates, particularly low short-term
rates, have driven up prices of alternative investments, be they bonds or
equities, because investors have nowhere else to put their money. If current
equity valuations are to endure, however, investors must be right to believe
in the government's rhetoric about the feasibility of sustained growth with
low inflation.
Triumph of hope
This is the triumph of hope over repeated disappointment. But it is indeed
what the chancellor is promising. Growth of real GDP is, says the Red Book,
to accelerate smoothly from 2 1/4 per cent in 1994-95 to 3 per cent by
1996-97. Meanwhile, underlying retail price inflation is to fall from 3 1/4
per cent next year to 2 1/2 per cent in 1996-97 and 2 per cent thereafter.
It looks too wonderful to be true. It is not that wonderful, since what is
to deliver this happy combination of growth with falling inflation is
persistent excess capacity. Unemployment is, for example, assumed to remain
at 2.75m until 1996-97. But, given the relatively depressed starting point
and the fiscal action that has now been taken, the forecast looks at the
least feasible.
Cost competitiveness, allowing for exchange rate changes, was 'probably 20
per cent better in the third quarter of 1993 than a year earlier and is
forecast to remain at close to that level during 1994', says the Red Book.
The current account deficit is now forecast, on imperfect figures, at only
Pounds 9 1/2 bn (1 1/2 per cent of GDP) in 1993 and the same in 1994. If
right, this suggests the first of the twin deficits is not going to be the
problem some have feared, or at least not soon. As for the second of the
twins, the fiscal deficit, that too now looks under control.
Sadistic policies
The interesting question is not whether markets are right to believe in the
logic of the masochistic fiscal policy, but rather whether they should trust
in the durability of its sadistic politics. One issue is whether the
government can get away with freezing the public sector's wage bill in
nominal terms for a period of three years. Earnings in the economy are bound
to rise by about 10 per cent or so over the period. If earnings in the
public sector were to rise pari passu, employment in the public sector would
have to fall by half a million, which looks neither feasible, nor desirable.
The policy would only be sustainable, without an explosion, if inflation
were to fall even faster than forecast. This suggests slow declines in
short-term interest rates. But this also means there would be the risk of
only a gentle recovery and, given the fiscal squeeze, very slow rises indeed
in real personal disposable incomes after tax for those in work. The Red
Book says real personal disposable income could rise 1 per cent in 1994, the
same as in 1993. It is unlikely to rise any more than that, on the
government's forecasts, for many years thereafter.
With the public sector possibly in turmoil and most voters not becoming
noticeably better off during the recovery, it will take a great deal of
nerve for the government to persist. Maybe Mr Clarke has the guts for the
task. But does his party? Once markets begin to question the politics, for
how long will they find Mr Clarke's hairshirt economics so delightful?

FT  04 DEC 93 / Man in the News: Plaudits for the main contender - Kenneth
Clarke / A chancellor who diets on common sense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke is just like the rest of us. He likes to be patted on the
back. So in the aftermath of Tuesday's Budget the no-nonsense chancellor has
been in more than usually expansive form.
Entertaining at Downing Street, sipping from a chipped coffee mug in his
House of Commons office or putting away a pint or three in the MPs' bar, Mr
Clarke has basked in the applause for his debut.
The only moment that he has looked disconcerted was when one of No 11's
smart caterers offered him a pre-lunch glass of something called elderflower
presse.
Never mind that voters will eventually wake up to the biggest tax increase
in living memory and discover that there is no money to build the village
by-pass or new school promised for next year. This government lives by the
day and week not the month and year.
Mr Clarke was charged on Tuesday with rescuing Mr John Major's government. A
public borrowing requirement of 8 per cent of national income - the level
which forced Labour to call in the International Monetary Fund back in 1976
 -had to be dealt with. But it had to be done in a way that did not give the
Conservative party at Westminster an excuse for another collective nervous
breakdown.
The new boy at the Treasury - he has been there for only six months though
it may seem longer - had also to present a plausible case that a return to
fiscal responsibility would not stifle the still-fragile economic recovery.
The judgment at Westminster was that Mr Clarke pulled off the trick. The
right and left of the Conservative party were satisfied by the judicious mix
of cuts in public spending plans and higher taxes. Tory MPs began to sound
as if they had remembered that they belonged to the party of government not
opposition.
Some in the Treasury judged the Dollars 1bn plan to compensate the poor and
the elderly for the imposition of value-added tax on domestic fuel
ludicrously generous, but it did take the immediate political sting out of
the issue.
Even Mr Norman Lamont, his still-disappointed predecessor, had a good word
for Mr Clarke's package. So too did Lord Lawson, not one to lavish praise
where criticism will do.
For all his self-confidence and experience of running big Whitehall
departments, Mr Clarke resented jibes from city scribblers that he would be
at sea at the Treasury because he had not been tutored in theoretical
economics.
True to his son-of-the-smokestack roots in the industrial Midlands, he sees
economics as the application of common-sense policies according to a set of
basic principles.
Governments should hold down inflation and give industry a liberal, lightly
regulated, environment in which it can expand. They should not borrow too
much. They should keep marginal tax rates low (he still believes it,
honestly), and act as a powerful force for free trade within what, as a good
European, Mr Clarke is quite happy to call the Union.
They should also move in from time to time to fill the gaps left by the
market, such as education and training and help for small businesses. Stable
exchange rates are a good idea because they allow business to plan ahead.
So, too, would be a single European currency.
You do not, as Mr Clarke might put it, have to spend your evenings buried in
economics textbooks to apply such a common sense approach.
So in the interests of brevity (he thinks it is possible to keep the
attention of the House of Commons for no more than 90 minutes) he put a
thick red pencil through the Treasury's traditional Budget lecture on the
state of the world economy.
But the Budget package was essentially political not just because Mr Clarke
has a natural disdain for smart-Alick economists.
The first big decision he took after arriving at the Treasury in June was
that the budget deficit had to come down faster than envisaged in the
medium-term plan set out by Mr Lamont in March. The new blueprint had to be
delivered in November.
Mr Clarke's reasoning was that a government which had rarely been in charge
of events since it was elected 18 months ago might then claim to have
restored its grip. Even the punters outside the precincts of Westminster
might think that it was worth taking some pretty bitter medicine if the
doctor appeared half-way competent.
The second decision was that his first Budget would not be an occasion for
fancy tax reform. He had more important things to do. Anyway, tax neutrality
is not a phrase which trips easily from his lips.
After the political uproar over VAT on fuel he had to find ways to raise
money that would minimise the potential for yet another Tory revolt.
Increases in the key rates of income tax were ruled out; so, too, a bit
later was any further extension of VAT, even though Mr Clarke remains
committed in the medium term to the switch from direct to indirect taxation.
Instead, the chancellor chose well from the rest of the items on the
Treasury's misery menu. Taken together, his tax increases will raise another
Pounds 6bn or so by 1996-97. But each one has been selected to minimise
Conservative opposition on the backbenches and among party activists.
Many Tory MPs are fed up with the steep increases in petrol prices. The
insurance and airline lobbies will ensure others grumble about the new
airport and insurance taxes. But these are not issues worth going to the
political stake for.
Of course, the size of the reductions in public spending which allowed Mr
Clarke to claim his Budget would knock another Pounds 18bn off the borrowing
requirement by 1997 was partly fortuitous.
His cabinet colleagues in the spending committee, known as EDX, were just as
frightened of the implications of borrowing running at Pounds 1bn a week.
They decided for once to behave responsibly.
Another windfall came from the heroic assumption that some 5m public service
workers would stand meekly by while increases in their pay are held below 2
per cent a year until the general election due by 1997.
Mr Clark is standing by the spending figures, but the politician who took on
the ambulancemen and very nearly lost is ready to admit that next year could
see a bout of serious industrial unrest.
He has moved swiftly to counter the idea that his Budget's planned cuts in
benefits for the unemployed and the sick are the beginning of an assault on
the welfare state.
Messrs Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, and Peter Lilley, the social
services secretary, have been powerful advocates in recent months of a
fundamental shift in the burden of welfare provision from the state to
individuals. Mr Lilley last week coined the clever phrase 'welfare society'.
It is no accident that, after being slapped down by Mr Clarke, he has
started to refer anew to the welfare state.
On Wednesday the chancellor praised Mr Portillo's undoubted skill in
co-ordinating the public spending round but then tilted at those on the Tory
right who wanted to encourage old-fashioned family values. The chancellor
seemed to be enjoying himself. But what next?
Like the rest of us, Mr Clarke is not at all sure. He thinks that the Tory
party will keep its nerve. Economists at the Treasury (and he does get on
with them) say that the recovery is robust enough to withstand in the short
term the dent to confidence caused by higher taxes and a squeeze on public
spending.
Inflation may be low enough now to get the government through the first year
of the public sector pay freeze. But next April will be rough as the voters
look at their pay packets and realise that the party which promised them tax
cuts at the last election has done quite the reverse.
And once or twice recently the Treasury's economists have been known to get
it wrong. If the recovery falters then Mr Clarke's fine arithmetic for
spending and borrowing will end up, with many other recent forecasts, in a
Treasury waste bin. It is hardly a secure background for the local elections
in May and the European elections a month later. For all their delight this
week, Tory MPs fear heavy defeats in those elections might yet derail the
government strategy for political recovery.
But all that is for the future. This week Mr Clarke confirmed his standing
as the cabinet's accomplished heavyweight. He has succeeded where the prime
minister has failed in uniting, for a moment at least, the right and left of
the Tory party. He insists that he has not thrown away his fundamental
commitment to centre-left one-nation Toryism. But he has found a way to
accommodate those who still grieve for Lady Thatcher. Mr Portillo confirmed
himself as the cabinet's fastest-rising star, but if the bus which Mr Major
has dodged so many times this past year were finally to actually hit the
prime minister, then Mr Clarke would be the one who replaced him.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Pain plus pragmatism: Reaction in the public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welfare services, such as the National Health Service, escaped punishment in
this week's Budget squeeze on public spending. But many of the workers who
deliver such services are now asking whether it will be at the expense of
their pay packets. At the same time, Mr Kenneth Clarke's decision to leave
some flexibility in his three-year public sector wage bill freeze will make
it more difficult for unions to campaign against the clampdown.
There remains uncertainty about precisely how the squeeze on public-sector
pay will work and also about its consequences: for instance, will the drive
to increase efficiency in the delivery of services be affected, and will
public sector employment drop sharply?
The initial reaction from important union leaders such as Mr John Edmonds of
the GMB general union was sanguine. Picking up on ministerial hints that
workers with political muscle such as policemen and nurses would get special
treatment, Mr Edmonds said: 'At one level this is power-bargaining at its
most naked. Yet there was also a pragmatic style to the announcement that we
can exploit.'
He warned that grandiose plans for national industrial action were likely to
prove futile and that unions should concentrate on setting a 'going rate' in
the public sector, allowing less powerful and less popular groups - such as
local government workers and National Health Service manual workers - to
piggy-back on more powerful groups. This strategy was followed by the unions
in the early 1980s when the government's policy of cash-limits on pay bills
was repeatedly broken.
The timetable on public sector pay may be heading in a similar direction. In
January the five pay review bodies, which recommend pay rates for about 2m
of the 5m public sector workers, will submit their reports for 1994-1995.
The future of the review bodies is in doubt following the 1.5 per cent
public sector pay limit imposed this year and the proposed pay bill freeze
for the next three. Recent personnel changes on the review bodies may make
them more friendly to the government. Yet they are still expected to produce
independent recommendations.
The recommendations could be difficult for the government to reject,
especially for groups such as nurses and teachers. If the union strategy
proves succesful, the government would come under pressure to offer similar
increases to civil servants and NHS manual workers, who start talks in
April.
For some parts of the public sector, pay rises at about the level of
inflation are still compatible with a pay bill freeze. The NHS, for example,
has only just begun to exploit the savings that can be made by improving the
efficiency of unskilled workers and the professions allied to medicine.
But the government's real target for such efficiency savings is its central
government civil servants and, above all, white-collar local government
employees, sheltered from job cuts to date.
The pay bill in local government, as in most of the public sector, is about
70 per cent of total costs. This year it will be frozen thanks to the 1.5
per cent pay limit and a 3 per cent reduction in staff. The total number of
employees is now below 2m.
This is only slightly below the numbers employed in local government in
1979, despite the fact that local government blue-collar workers have been
cut by one quarter thanks to compulsory competitive tendering.
Ministers believe there is fat to cut - car allowances in local government,
for example, total Pounds 600m a year - and would relish a confrontation
with Unison, the public services union, which has been flexing its muscles
over cuts.
The drawback of the overall strategy, according to Mr Doug Henderson,
Labour's local government spokesman, is that a three-year pay bill freeze
would either increase unemployment steeply or create an unacceptably large
pay gap between the public and private sector - damaging at a time when
staff are being asked to change their working habits of a lifetime.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Tory unease grows over 7% rise in council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS, JAMES BLITZ and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unease among Conservative MPs and councillors intensified yesterday over the
rise in council tax of about 7 per cent expected after this week's financial
settlement for local authorities.
Some Conservatives in London fear that higher bills could undermine the
party's electoral prospects in local elections next May, soon after the new
council tax bills are delivered - several London boroughs have been
subjected to steep cuts in the grant they receive.
One Conservative MP said London had been used as a 'milch cow' for the rest
of the country in the new settlement, announced on Thursday.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, predicted disaster for the
Conservatives in the local elections around the country.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent North, whose local authority sustained
the 10th greatest cut in standard spending assessment, said the expected
rises were 'a very serious matter' when inflation was 1.7 per cent and the
government was planning to freeze the public-sector pay bill.
'This is another way of raising taxes and it won't be popular in the run up
to the elections,' he said.
Brent was captured by the Conservatives from Labour in the last local
elections in 1990.
Wandsworth, a Conservative stronghold which suffered one of the sharpest
cuts, was confident that its council tax would remain 'lower than average'
thanks to the buffering grant given by the government to authorities which
lost heavily. The borough would not rule out cuts in services.
Mrs Kathy Tracey, a Conservative councillor in Wandsworth, described the
package as 'very worrying for Conservative boroughs'.
Finance experts for the local authority associations predicted that average
council tax bills would be in line with government predictions, thanks to
new measures for capping council budgets, which are tighter than ever.
Mr David Congdon, Conservative MP for Croydon North East, said that the
decision to cut the budget for transitional relief from the poll tax to
council tax from Pounds 380m to Pounds 130m next year could mean 'much
higher bills'.
Other London boroughs expected swingeing cuts in services to meet government
targets, with Hammersmith and Fulham predicting a cut of about Pounds 5m.
After cuts of Pounds 40m over the past two years, the council suggested it
would be difficult to make further cuts without job losses.
Leicester City Council, the largest non-metropolitan authority in England,
suffered a severe cut in its spending assessment, and must cut its budget to
stay within the government cap.
The city's SSA has been reduced by Pounds 6.4m. Mr Don Grant, director of
resources, said that over the next two years Leicester would have to reduce
spending by 12.5 per cent and this would cost jobs 'in hundreds rather than
tens'.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Coal subsidence pay-outs at risk, surveyors warn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Householders could receive insufficient compensation if they suffer mining
subsidence following the privatisation of the coal industry, the Royal
Institute of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday.
Measures for dealing with subsidence in the Coal Privatisation Bill,
published on Thursday, are unclear, the institute said. 'We are not
confident that the Pounds 35m to Pounds 40m a year estimate for subsidence
in the bill will prove sufficient.'
The institute said its measures gave householders little protection if a
private operator should become insolvent or deny responsibility for damage.
Instead of having one clearly responsible statutory authority, British Coal,
householders would have to deal with the new coal authority and possibly one
or more private operators, the institute said.
British Coal announced separately that it aims to reach agreement as soon as
possible with Edwards Energy on the resumption of mining at Trentham in
Staffordshire.
This takes to three the number of closed pits where British Coal has
indicated mining can be resumed by private operators. Edwards is also in
negotiations for Coventry colliery and British Coal has agreed in principle
to lease Clipston colliery in the Yorkshire region to RJB Mining.
Meanwhile British Coal yesterday ceased production at three pits, Bentley
and Hatfield in the Yorkshire region, and Silverdale in Staffordshire, as
part of its closures programme. Miners at Littleton in Staffordshire have
agreed to stop production next Friday. By Christmas, British Coal will have
only 22 pits left in production.
In a further development, the coal industry's two pension funds reinforced
British Coal's concerns about the government's plans for pensions after
privatisation.
Concerns centre on the extent of the trade secretary's powers over the
trustees and the omission from the bill of government guarantees for
post-privatisation benefit improvements above the inflation rate.
Although the government has promised that benefits will rise in line with
the retail prices index, the trustees are concerned about the allocations of
future surpluses and a clause in the bill giving the trade secretary powers
of 'national interest'.
Mrs Rhoslyn Roberts, secretary of the staff scheme, said that the
government's proposals did 'not yet meet the objectives of the trustees'.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Labour warns of slide in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public investment will fall dramatically as a result of the first Budget
delivered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, said yesterday.
Mr Brown told a post-Budget seminar in London that general government
investment would fall by 3 per cent next year and 3.5 per cent in 1995-96.
He said a Labour analysis of the Budget Red Book, which outlines tax changes
and public spending plans, showed that net public capital expenditure would
fall from Pounds 13.5bn this year to Pounds 10.25bn by 1997.
'This means a 25 per cent fall in the value of public investment, one of the
biggest cuts we have seen,' he said.
Mr Brown said the March Budget, delivered by Mr Norman Lamont, had also
failed to live up to its billing as a Budget for investment.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, told a party meeting in Edinburgh that the
gloss was 'fast fading' from the Budget. 'The truth about the Budget is
sinking in and the country is not impressed,' he said.
Mr Smith said the Budget - the 'biggest tax hike in history' - was the
direct responsibility of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who was earlier
chief secretary to the Treasury and chancellor.
'He has held the three jobs which give him immediate responsibility for the
catastrophic decline. The buck stops very firmly with him.'
In another attack on the Budget Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy
leader, said Mr Clarke had made 'the clearest declaration imaginable that
the Tories are the party of high taxation, just as they are the party of
high crime'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said many of Britain's
10,000 rural post offices were at risk of closure because of a 76 per cent
increase in Post Office payments to the government.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Focused fight on wage rises urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions should not mount a national campaign of action against the
government's planned three-year freeze of public-sector wages, Mr John
Edmonds, head of the GMB general union, said yesterday.
Instead, he said, unions should use workers with political muscle to set a
fair 'going rate' for others to follow.
'In the early 1980s cash limits were made unworkable thanks to an effective
going-rate strategy,' he said.
He said the freeze, with flexibility for special groups, was 'power
bargaining at its most naked'. But he also said he detected a pragmatic,
opportunistic stance in the way it was likely to be implemented.
TUC officials say that a sector-by-sector approach is likely to be more
fruitful than a national campaign. However Unison, the biggest
public-service union, may still push for co-ordinated action between
local-government workers and civil servants, especially in the light of the
relatively successful one-day stoppage against market testing on November 5.
The unions will be hoping for a lead from the independent pay review bodies,
covering 2m public-sector work-ers, due to report in January.
The government's own evidence to the nurses review body calls for a
phasing-out of the right of workers in hospital trusts to hold their
nationally negotiated pay terms.
'The intention is to enable trusts to implement schemes for all their staff
irrespective of whether they had opted for new locally determined employment
contracts,' the Department of Health said.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Clarke wants unity over welfare state: Rightwing ministers
told to tone down rhetoric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke has told rightwing cabinet colleagues to tone down their
rhetoric about the future of the welfare state to minimise the political
backlash against planned cuts in unemployment and invalidity benefits.
The chancellor's warning that ministers must speak with one voice on the
future of welfare provision was endorsed by the full cabinet this week. It
was followed by Mr Clarke's public declarations that the government was
committed to reforming, not dismantling, the welfare state. Mr Clarke also
won cabinet backing for his public statements that the government was
committed to maintaining the state pension as a basic building block for
retirement. He dismissed the idea floated by Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, and by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the
Treasury, that people might be encouraged to opt out of state pensions.
In Mr Clarke's view the government's drive to persuade people to make
greater private provision for old age must not undermine the notion of the
state pension as a bulwark against poverty. He told colleagues that many
relatively poor and disadvantaged people could not find suitable substitutes
for a basic state scheme.
The chancellor has also rejected the idea that the government should aim for
a permanent reduction in the size of the welfare state, which at present
takes about 45 per cent of national income. He believes that his planned
reduction in that share to about 40 per cent would leave it at the level
necessary to sustain the welfare state over the long term.
In spite of the determination of those on the right of the Tory party to
promote family values, Mr Clarke has also given a clear signal that his
future Budgets could see the disappearance of the married man's income tax
allowance.
The allowance, with mortgage interest relief, was cut to 15 per cent with
effect from April 1995 in this week's Budget. Mr Clarke acknowledged that
the Tories' manifesto pledge meant that mortgage interest relief would
survive to the next parliament. He has pointed out that no similar pledge
exists on the married man's allowance. He regards this as an anomaly left
from the wish not to create 'losers' when independent taxation of husbands
and wives was introduced.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Sega TV channel looks to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sega Channel, the computer games channel due to launch in the US in the
spring, is considering a move into Europe, starting with the UK in 1995.
The channel, owned by the games manufacturer Sega of Japan, Time Warner and
TCI, the American cable operator, has been talking to cable and satellite
television operators across Europe, according to New Media Markets, the
Financial Times newsletter.
The channel is expected to launch on cable first although the company has
also been talking to British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster in
which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.
The UK is Sega's main priority because of the estimated installed base of
1.4m Megadrive games consoles. Through a decoder owners of consoles will be
able to get access to a range of games, including previews of new games.
The games company hopes the channel will both stimulate the sale of consoles
and games cartridges and at the same time create an additional stream of
revenue.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Admission adds to SFO injury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The admission that a substantial bureaucratic blunder was made in the
handling of documents relating to the prosecution of Mr Asil Nadir could not
have come at a worse time for the Serious Fraud Office.
In a Commons written answer Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general,
admitted that the SFO had twice circulated copies of documents it was not
entitled either to see or to distribute to others.
The details are embarrassing to Sir Nicholas, who admitted his previous
statement to the Commons in June that the documents were not circulated was
'incomplete' and 'misleading'. But the details are even more damaging to the
SFO.
They come just days after criticism of its legal judgment following the
outcome of its prosecution of Mr Roger Levitt, the disgraced financial
salesman, who was sentenced to just 180 hours of community service after a
plea bargain.
The latest revelations connected to Mr Nadir cast doubt over the SFO's
managerial and administrative competence, and are highlighted in the
exchange of correspondence between Mr George Staple, head of the SFO, and Mr
Peter Knight, a partner with Vizards, the law firm which acted for Mr Nadir
until his bankruptcy.
In his letter to Mr Staple in July Mr Knight suggested that 'no workable
system existed' in the SFO for handling privileged documents. The allegation
was strongly rejected by Mr Staple in his response in a letter written on
Thursday.
The letters focus on at least five bags of correspondence seized in two
police raids - one in October 1990 on the offices of Polly Peck
International, the company controlled by Mr Nadir, and the other on Mr
Nadir's Mayfair home at the time of his arrest in December that year.
The exact content of the letters is unclear, but Mr Nadir's lawyers at that
time claimed that they contained correspondence between him and them which
was covered by privilege.
The SFO initially contested the status of these documents but an independent
barrister gave an opinion largely supporting Vizards' case.
Yesterday's further admission was prompted by a letter in July from Mr
Knight to Mr Staple that the previous statement did not fully explain the
position. It says that some of these documents were passed on both to the
SFO's lawyers prosecuting Mr Nadir, and to the Polly Peck administrators.
It was on this point that Sir Nicholas had to admit that he had misled the
Commons in his earlier statement. In June Sir Nicholas had told the Commons
that the bags of correspondence had been opened but that nothing more had
been done with the documents.
Mr Knight protested to the SFO over the circulation of these documents. The
failure of the SFO to react properly to his protests forced both the
attorney general and Mr Staple to apologise yesterday.
Sir Nicholas said: 'I regret that the fact that copies of privileged
documents had been circulated was not acknowledged by the then case
controller to Mr Nadir's solicitor, and that no attempt was made to retrieve
them until December 1991, despite Vizards' frequently expressed concern
about the matter and the fact that the then case controller appears to have
recognised at least by January 1991 that copies of potentially privileged
documents had been circulated.'
The case controller in charge of the Nadir case, Ms Lorna Harris, was the
only SFO officer mentioned specifically in the statements made by Mr Staple
and Sir Nicholas. However, an SFO spokes-man insisted nobody was being
singled out for the errors.
Ms Harris, who has since left the SFO but remains a civil servant, yesterday
refused to comment. Her solicitor, Mr John Clitheroe of Kingsley Napley,
issued a statement saying: 'She has taken legal advice because she is very
unhappy about what has been said about her by the attorney general. She is
considering her position.'

A soft-drinks company based in Izmir, Turkey, which holds Coca Cola's local

Brown writes.
Mr Cemal Ozgorkey, head of the privately owned Ozgorkey Group, confirmed
that he was in talks with the administrators to PPI. Meyna made net losses

FT  04 DEC 93 / 'I can't believe I would sign all those benefits away': The
controversy about personal pensions advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A primary school teacher who persuaded a life insurance company to buy her
out of a personal pension and back into an employer's scheme at a cost of
Pounds 21,000 is one of about 500,000 similar cases to be investigated by
securities regulators.
Through the efforts of her union, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers,
Mrs Jennifer Brown, 33, persuaded Abbey Life, the life insurance company
which had persuaded her out of her scheme and into a personal pension, to
buy her back in.
Mrs Brown, from Dudley in the West Midlands, transferred out of the
teachers' pension scheme four years ago. She said: 'When you sit down in the
cold light of day and think about it, you wonder why you did it.'
'I can't believe I would sign all those benefits away without even
investigating it,' she added.
Securities regulators are preparing to investigate the cases of up to
500,000 people like Mrs Brown, who transferred out of employers' pension
schemes into personal pension plans. They estimate that as much as Pounds
7bn has come out of employers' schemes into private plans. An initial review
of files has shown that in too many cases agents failed to obtain enough
information.
Mrs Brown's action cost Abbey Life about Pounds 21,000, enough to repay both
the transfer value of her contributions when she left the scheme with eight
years of service and to compensate for the four years when she was a
personal pension holder.
Mr Peter Hood of the Teachers Superannuation Scheme said nearly 27,000
teachers had transferred to a personal pension or had opted not to join the
scheme at the start of their employment.
The teachers' scheme offers fully-indexed retirement benefits and death in
service benefits of up to 18 months salary. Also, their employer contributes
an additional 8 per cent of their salary for the 6 per cent of gross salary
contributed by each teacher.
Mr Hood said: 'We face the difficulty that the salesman is there and can
influence the teacher. They can cast aspersions on our scheme.' By the time
the scheme has tried to explain to members what they are giving up, they
have already been talked into a personal pension by a seasoned sales agent.
Because personal pensions are rarely bolstered by a contribution from the
employer, offer no survivors' benefits in the event of death and do not
offer indexed benefits on retirement it is difficult for them ever to be as
attractive as an employer's scheme.
But Mr Stewart Ritchie, director of pensions at Scottish Equitable, a
leading private pensions provider, said individuals did not necessarily make
decisions based on numbers.
Nevertheless Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life insurance
industry, last year issued guidance to sales agents telling them that there
were almost no circumstances in which it was best advice to switch from an
employer's scheme to a personal pension.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Major shifts position in Ulster talks: Dublin stresses end
to IRA violence - Go-between explains republican 'pique'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Irish persistence paid off at yesterday's Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin, with
the British delegation being persuaded to work intensively on the joint
declaration being sought by Dublin aimed at a permanent halt to IRA
violence.
Considerable differences remain over its phrasing, which will be discussed
in subsequent summits scheduled for later in the month. Agreement is by no
means assured. But the Irish government can derive some satisfaction in
having convinced Mr John Major to tackle the peace process before moving on
to British concerns over constitutional issues, in particular the Irish
republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland.
The Irish proposal, contained in a document tabled last July, has been back
and forth between the two governments since, and disagreement over its focus
on the issue of Irish self-determination has been the principal stumbling
block to progress on the peace initiative.
Self-determination is viewed as a loaded term by the British and by Northern
Ireland's unionists, who see it as implying a veto by the republic over
constitutional changes in the north. The Irish insist that this is not so.
Mr Noel Dempsey, the Irish government chief whip, said: 'There seems to be
some confusion in the British government's mind as to what we mean by
self-determination.'
He added: 'What we are talking about is separate referenda, north and south,
where both peoples in both parts of the island can make their views known.
If consent is freely given, if a majority in both parts of the island decide
that they want a united Ireland, of whatever form, then we will abide by
that. We are not talking about collective self-determination.'
In Belfast, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, last night said that
hopes for an immediate unilateral ceasefire by the IRA was 'unrealistic'.
Mr Richard Macaulay, Sinn Fein official spokesman, said: 'It is unrealistic
to expect that the IRA will unilaterally end their actions without political
progress.'
Mr Jim Rodgers, deputy leader of the official Unionist Party on Belfast City
Council, warned that loyalist paramilitaries were preparing a backlash if
the London-Dublin peace process led to big concessions to the nationalist
community.
While the talks were taking place the army discovered a 1,000lb IRA bomb
intended for an army patrol. The device was planted on the outskirts of
Belfast near a primary school.
The nationalist goal of a united Ireland does not seem to be as crucial to
Catholics in Northern Ireland as many have believed. An opinion poll in
yesterday's Irish Times indicated that only 32 per cent of Catholics in
Ulster favour a united Ireland, although 65 per cent favour a constitutional
change involving a greater role for Dublin.

FT  04 DEC 93 / DTI minister attacks EU steel subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday risked further friction with fellow members of the
European Union by pledging to fight for an end to state subsidies for
inefficient Continental steel producers.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said subsidies were at the heart of the
steel sector's difficulties.
'The continued operation of inefficient companies propped up by massive
state aid is directly responsible for the excess capacity and uneconomic
pricing,' he told the British Iron and Steel Producers Association in
London.
'The UK steel industry has had to take necessary but painful decisions. It
is time for others to play by the rules and, if necessary, to suffer the
pain of restructuring.'
Mr Sainsbury's tough stance on the European Commission's controversial
restructuring plans for the steel industry has irritated Germany, whose plan
to subsidise Ekostahl, the troubled east German producer, is strongly
opposed by the UK.
Mr Sainsbury upset the commission last month when he told European
counterparts in Brussels that 'no agreement would be better than a bad
agreement' on subsidies. Agreement on the subsidies issue has to be
unanimous.
The November meeting of industry ministers ended in disarray after Italy
rejected a commission compromise on cuts in subsidies and capacity at Ilva,
the loss-making state steelmaker.
Another industry ministers' meeting will probably be called for December 17,
but Mr Sainsbury said yesterday that it would not be an easy meeting. 'I may
be unpopular with some of my ministerial colleagues but I am determined
personally to get us a much more level playing field,' he said.
Mr Sainsbury received support from Mr David Stone, the association's
outgoing president. He said that political decisions by national or regional
governments to subsidise steel-related activities must be fought by the UK
through every political means.
'Soft compromises brought about through ministerial fatigue, or from a sense
of isolation, or in the theoretical interests of a 'greater Europe' must be
resisted,' Mr Stone told the association's annual meeting.
State operating subsidies to some Continental steelworks were being paid to
ensure that other private-sector plants closed instead of 'politically
sensitive' ones, he said.

FT  04 DEC 93 / 'Failure' schools face new curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first two schools to be branded 'failures' by Ofsted, the new government
inspection service, must draw up urgent action plans if they are to avoid
being placed under the direct control of the education department.
From next month Mr John Patten, education secretary, will have the power to
appoint 'education associations' to take over the running of schools in
England and Wales from governors and local education authorities.
He will make a decision on whether to do so after seeing the schools' action
plans, which they have until February to prepare.
According to Ofsted the quality of learning at the Crook Primary School in
Durham was unsatisfactory, there were 'major weaknesses in the leadership,
management and administration'. Governors rejected the finding, saying: 'We
have difficulty in recognising Crook Primary School as we know it in much of
what it (Ofsted) has to say.'
Brookside Special School in Derby was found not to meet curriculum
requirements and lacked effective policies on assessment admissions.
Derbyshire County Council responded by freezing admissions and introducing a
range of improvements to registration and health and safety measures.
Mr Dave Wilcox, the council's education chairman, said: 'The authority had
already identified a range of problems at the school following our own
inspection. It is disappointing that many of our recommendations have not
been implemented.'
Labour accepted Ofsted's reports, but questioned the response which could be
made by Mr Patten. Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'The
hit squad approach is not going to be the most effective way of tackling
difficulties.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / Paper war lifts Sinn Fein image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Sinn Fein had claimed three weeks ago that it had been briefed on
sensitive cabinet discussions and last year's failed three-stranded talks by
a British government representative, the suggestion would have been widely
ridiculed.
But when the allegation was made by senior figures in the IRA's political
wing on Thursday it had enough credibility to be carried prominently by the
British and Irish press - and to exacerbate tension between the two
governments on the eve of yesterday's meeting between Mr John Major and Mr
Albert Reynolds.
One Irish minister - Mr Noel Dempsey - even suggested that the allegation
would influence the agenda of the meeting as London would need to clear the
air before substantive issues were discussed.
'The initial difficulty will be the revelations and allegations that have
been made,' said Mr Dempsey, speaking with the full approval of the Irish
government. 'They have to be got out of the way . . . before substantial
negotiations can continue.'
Sinn Fein's enhanced credibility is the direct result of its successes in
the 'document war' that it has been waging with London. Time and again the
British government's version of events has been shown up as less accurate
than the Republican version. Put bluntly, London is on the defensive.
This was underlined yesterday when officials would not be drawn on Sinn
Fein's latest claims.
Since admitting at the start of this week that it had been in prolonged
contact with Republican leaders the British government has also had to own
up to errors in the record it published of the messages the two sides
exchanged.
By conceding 11 mistakes in one key paper the government has accepted that
Sinn Fein's version of the document was accurate in virtually every detail.
Sinn Fein's propaganda coup is all the more noteworthy since its own record
of reliability is not untarnished. For example, it has now belatedly made
clear that its 11-paragraph response to the British conditions was not
passed on until July - as the government stated - rather than April as was
implied by Sinn Fein documents.
Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein chief of staff, said on Thursday that this
response was 'prepared' in April but not 'lodged with the contact to be
passed to the British' until July.
In addition, fresh documents released by Sinn Fein on Thursday appear to
modify its position over a panicky message received by the government on
November 2, shortly after the Greysteel shootings, warning that the country
'could be at the point of no return'.
Having denied the message Sinn Fein now appears to acknowledge that a
communication was issued, but says it was 'without our authority or
knowledge'.
A newspaper interview with Mr McGuinness published in September provides a
further caution against automatically treating Sinn Fein's public statements
with credulity. Asked whether there had been feelers from the government to
Sinn Fein, Mr McGuinness is reported to have replied: 'No, there haven't
been.'

FT  04 DEC 93 / 'Floaters' carried messages of peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An intermediary who passed messages between the IRA and the UK government
talked to Jimmy Burns yesterday.
Channels of communication between Sinn Fein and the government have involved
a range of so-called 'floaters' - intermediaries drawn from the church,
local government, community politics and serving and retired civil servants.
The government has said that serious contact got under way only in February
after the IRA sent a message: 'The conflict is over but we need your advice
on how to bring it to a close.'
However, one of the floaters said that by then both sides had acknowledged
that 'no side could win (the war)'.
In private contacts it had been understood that if an agreement was
announced it would have to be phrased so as not to suggest that either side
was victor or loser.
'This explains the pique of Sinn Fein over the last few days,' said the
floater. 'What they were trying to do was to get off the hook with dignity,
but Sir Patrick Mayhew . . . put them in a very difficult situation with . .
. supporters.'
The floater said there had been more communication in the last two years
than before, and it had become particularly intense by the start of this
year. At an early stage of the talks Sinn Fein officials were uncertain
whether the people who put themselves forward as 'government
representatives' were really reflecting government policy.
Some of the mediators involved in the early stages of the Hume-Adams talks
are believed to have been priests from the Clonard monastery in west
Belfast.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Own-brand groceries challenge premium products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most British shoppers believe 'own brand' groceries sold by supermarket
chains offer at least as good value as branded products from leading
manufacturers, a survey shows.
The survey, by retail consultancy Verdict Research, says the popularity of
own-brand lines and their growing use by retailers to spearhead
price-cutting campaigns pose a serious threat to branded manufacturers,
which may have to lower prices further to avoid losing sales.
Almost two thirds of consumers said the quality of own brands was equal to
or better than leading branded equivalents. Almost three-quarters said
own-brand prices were about the same or cheaper.
J. Sainsbury's own brands scored highest on quality. Almost two-thirds of
consumers also said they rated the quality of 'no-frills' own-brand products
at Kwik Save, the discount chain, superior or equal to manufacturer brands.
About a third of consumers said they were likely to choose own-brand
versions of biscuits, cakes, canned groceries and dairy products over
manufacturers' brands. Less than 10 per cent said they preferred own-brand
beer and pet food.
Verdict says Tesco was using own brands more aggressively than any other
large supermarket chain as a price-cutting weapon. Tesco brands were being
displayed much more prominently and stocked in larger quantities.
The cheapest supermarket was Kwik Save, where a basket of groceries cost
Pounds 29.18, while the same goods at Tesco cost Pounds 35.12. Waitrose was
dearest, at Pounds 39.58, followed by Safeway and Sainsbury's.
The research into shelf-space and pricing was carried out in late October,
shortly before Sainsbury's cut prices on 300 own-brand lines.
Cross-channel shoppers are spending about Pounds 400m a year on personal
imports of beer, wine and spirits.
A report yesterday by Verdict says that increased allowances of personal
imports of duty-paid drinks this year have had 'a dramatic impact'.
Although the chancellor did not increase the duty on beer or spirits in the
Budget, the outlook for UK off-licences is not bright, Verdict says. Price
competition has intensified in the Pounds 6.5bn take-home market and profit
margins of specialist shops are wafer thin.
Supermarkets have benefited most from growth in the take-home trade and now
claim 56 per cent of sales. Off-licences are attempting to match prices but
only the biggest chains, Thresher and Victoria Wine, have the buying power
to compete on price for a prolonged period, the report says.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Equatorial Bank surrenders licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equatorial Bank, the small Asian-owned bank which was placed into
administration in March, has voluntarily surrendered its Bank of England
banking licence after various attempts to rescue it failed.
Mr Gareth Hughes, the administrator from Ernst &amp; Young, said that the bank
had surrendered its banking licence because there was 'no prospect of
rescue'.
The Bank of England said that Equatorial was one of two companies deleted
from its list of authorised institutions under the 1987 Banking Act. The
other was Bunge Finance.
Mr Hughes said that an interim payment of 25p in the pound had already been
made to Equatorial's creditors. He expected that further payments would be
made in the next few months as loans were reallocated to other institutions.

An investment broker who cheated clients out of Pounds 645,000 to prop up
his ailing business was jailed for four years yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr Kenneth Renton, the former chairman of Wentworth Asset Management,
pleaded guilty last month to 14 charges of theft and four of obtaining
property by deception.
Passing sentence at Inner London Crown Court Judge Fingret said Mr Renton's
actions amounted to 'persistent and blatant misuse of clients' money'.
Mr Renton was also disqualified from being a company director for 10 years.
He had denied a further 20 charges of theft and deception involving Pounds
1m. These charges have been laid on the file.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Prison officer protest on rights to be blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation clarifying prison officers' trade union rights and preventing
them from taking strike action is to be introduced by the government in the
current parliamentary session.
Last month Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, won a High Court injunction
against the Prison Officers' Association establishing that, since prison
officers had the status of constable, they could not withdraw their labour.
The union plans to contest in court the loss of the right to strike. It
appears that, even if it won, the victory would be short-lived because the
proposed legislation would overturn it.
Mr Howard said yesterday: 'I intend to introduce legislation this session
which, while maintaining the position that it is unlawful for them to call
industrial action, also extends normal trade union status to organisations
representing staff who currently have the powers of a constable.'
This would give the POA and its members access to industrial tribunals, pay
bargaining procedures and other trade union activities.
The government further strengthened its legal grip on the POA yesterday with
a separate injunction against officers at Preston prison who had refused to
accept new admissions.
Mr John Bartell, POA chairman, told a special delegate conference earlier
this week that constables had a duty to prevent breaches of the peace, and
said officers would be within their rights to refuse admissions if they
believed disruption or disturbances were likely.
Officers at Preston turned prisoners away on Thursday but Mr Howard
yesterday obtained an injunction against six POA representatives who, the
Prison Service said, had contravened the instructions of their governor.
Similar action had been proposed by officers at Hull prison on Monday.
Mr Howard yesterday issued the first set of key objectives for police
forces. The police bill in the present parliamentary session provides for
the annual setting of key objectives to measure and enhance police
performance, and the 1994-95 exercise will be a trial run before the bill
becomes law.
The objectives will require forces to seek to increase detection rates for
violent crime and household burglaries, to provide high visibility policing,
to respond promptly to emergency calls, and to target and prevent particular
local problem crimes in partnership with other agencies and the public.
Success will be measured by a series of performance indicators including the
number of crimes detected per 100 officers, public satisfaction with levels
of foot and mobile patrols and the percentage of responses to incidents
achieved within target times.

Equatorial was one of three Asian banks in London to close since last
October, prompting concern about the supply of finance to Asian businesses.
They lost liquidity after the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Among those who expressed an interest in rescuing Equatorial was a group
headed by Mr Ketan Somaia, a Kenyan Asian businessman.

FT  04 DEC 93 / State 'central to SA growth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A think-tank linked to the African National Congress yesterday published
proposals to revive the South African economy which stress the central role
of the state, rather than the private sector, in triggering growth from now
until the end of the century.
Introducing the proposals from the Macroeconomic Research Group, Mr Trevor
Manuel, head of the ANC economics department, said they did not represent
ANC policy. But ANC economists were involved in drawing them up, and they
could have a significant influence over policy formulation. One ANC official
said that some of the proposals were 'too conservative'.
The research group, which includes members of the radical trade union
movement, Cosatu, as well as members of the ANC and academics from local and
foreign universities, drew up an economic model in which the state's role is
central - in direct contradiction to the government's model, which focuses
on private sector investment to revive growth.
'To achieve the goals of economic growth and redistribution, the state. . .
must play a strong and active role in leading development,' the group said.
Growth would rise from 1.1 per cent in 1994 to nearly 5 per cent annually
within the first years of the next century, it said. This year's growth is
expected to total 1 per cent.
The model focuses on job creation, as well as improving access to and
quality of health, housing, and electricity. It calls for a minimum wage to
be set, but rules out any early recourse to a wealth tax.
The think-tank said a post-apartheid government should resist raising
personal and corporate tax rates, but the tax system should be restructured
and should include a multiple-rate indirect value added tax favouring the
poor.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Luanda and Unita clear last hurdle to ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Angolan government and Unita rebels said yesterday they had cleared the
last obstacles to a ceasefire agreement at talks in Lusaka, agencies report.
They said they would report details, probably today, to United Nations
mediators who have been trying to bring an end to the long-running conflict
in Angola.
'All conditions are now complete for the ceasefire,' said a rebel
negotiator.
The key dispute had been over arrangements for disarming rebel forces. This
issue threatened to derail the peace talks which opened in the Zambian
capital of Lusaka on November 15 under the chairmanship of UN envoy Alioune
Blondin Beye. But the disagreement appeared now to have been settled.
The UN has been seeking a ceasefire for the whole country, allowing free
movement of goods and people.
The UN envoy was due to fly to Angola's capital Luanda today for
consultations. One diplomat said he believed the envoy would press on with
outstanding political questions which the rebels wanted resolved. These
related to what role Unita would play in a future government.
The government and Unita have battled each other since Angola's independence
from Portugal in 1975.
The war halted after a peace accord in May 1991 but Unita, led by Mr Jonas
Savimbi, took up arms again after disputing its defeat in UN-supervised
elections in September 1992.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Malawi troops attack military wing of party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least 16 people were killed when Malawian soldiers stormed into action
yesterday to disarm the country's Young Pioneers, the paramilitary wing of
the ruling Malawi Congress Party.
Troops assaulted the national headquarters and district offices of the Young
Pioneers. National offices of the Congress Party were also strafed with
gunfire, ransacked and looted by soldiers.
Thousands of civilians took to the streets of the capital, Lilongwe,
cheering the army.
They shouted: 'No more Banda, no more Tembo, no more Chakauamba' - referring
to former 'president for life' Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda and two members of a
presidential council that has shared power since Dr Banda's collapse with a
stroke in October.
The military strike against the Pioneers came after opposition politicians
had complained of a delay in disarming the paramilitary group.
A call to disarm the 2,000-strong Pioneers came two months ago from a
National Consultative Council, comprising government and opposition
representatives. The council was charged with overseeing Malawi's transition
to democracy following a referendum in June, when Malawians voted to switch
to a multi-party system of politics.
There has been long-running tension between the Pioneers, the police and the
politically neutral army. The government has pleaded the case for
integrating the Pioneers into the national security forces.
It was not immediately clear how far up the army hierarchy the order to
attack originated.
The operation began when 200 soldiers assaulted Youth House, the Pioneers'
headquarters in Lilongwe. Armed Pioneers initially returned fire but
resistance collapsed within minutes.
Two army helicopters circled low overhead, apparently in support of the
attack.
Army units then moved on to the Kamuzu Youth Institute, a training centre
for Pioneers, and to urban district offices. The institute was soon ablaze,
with civilians braving the fire to loot the premises.
Gunfire had died down in the city by late afternoon, although civilian
looting of commercial and government premises had begun. At the national
headquarters of the Malawi Congress Party, soldiers were systematically
removing anything of value.

FT  04 DEC 93 / India urged to safeguard local industry
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indian industrialists yesterday urged the government to safeguard the
interests of domestic companies when opening up the economy to foreign
investors.
Import duties should be cut 'gradually' to protect domestic industry and
special temporary duties should be introduced to insulate Indian companies
from violent swings in international prices, says the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a national employers' organisation, in a
formal pre-budget report to the government.
The federation says Indian groups should not be obliged to compete at a
disadvantage to foreign groups and need a 'level playing-ground'.
The federation's call echoes the fears expressed by an informal group of
conservative industrialists called the Bombay Club, who have already
conveyed their worries to the government.
The industrialists' concerns have surfaced at a time when multinational
groups have started making high-profile investments in India in the wake of
the government's economic reforms. The purchase by Coca Cola, the US soft
drinks group, of Parle, India's leading cola maker, prompted suggestions
from some critics that Indian industry faces a mass takeover.
The federation's report carries proposals for changes in tax, trade and
financial regulations which Indian companies feel discriminate against
domestic groups.
In its most controversial, protectionist-sounding suggestion, the report
demands planned cuts in import duties should continue but should be 'gradual
keeping in view the interests of the indigenous industries.' It also wants
duties to be lowest on raw materials and highest on finished goods to give
'the requisite support to the domestic industry.'
The federation calls for stronger anti-dumping measures and a new
'regulatory duty' which would be imposed for limited periods on imports when
international prices fell sharply to allow Indian industry to adjust.
The report says corporate tax rates in India, which range between 51.75 per
cent and 57.5 per cent, are higher than rates in other countries. Foreign
financial institutions investing in India enjoy special low rates of capital
gains tax of 10 per cent on long-term gains (against 40 per cent for
domestic companies) and of 25-30 per cent on short-term gains (compared with
51.75 per cent.)
The federation says interest rates should be cut from the current range of
17-22 per cent to 10 per cent, nearer international levels. It wants an end
to restrictions on inter-company loans and investments and on the use of
shares as security for loans.
The report said: 'Unless the reform measures are properly sequenced and a
level playing-ground is provided to the domestic industry, the national
economy will face serious adverse impact.'
Exports in October grew 15.2 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, extending a surge
which started at the beginning of the financial year in April, according to
figures published yesterday. But the pace of growth has fallen from an
average of 21 per cent in the six months to September. Imports remained flat
due to continued stagnation in Indian industry.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Former Sumitomo bank chief dies
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ichiro Isoda, former chairman of Sumitomo Bank who was forced to resign
following an illegal loan scandal and his involvement with stock and
property speculators, died yesterday. He was 80.
Better known as the 'Emperor' of Sumitomo, he fell from grace in 1990 after
six years as president and seven years as chairman. He was personally
responsible for Sumitomo's emergence as Japan's top profit making bank in
the late 1980s, aggressively expanding operations using cheap credit.
However, Mr Isoda was also widely believed to be the force behind the bank's
involvement with real estate and stock speculators. Sumitomo made large
loans to Itoman, a trading company turned property developer and art
collector, which was linked to underworld figures.
Mr Isoda took Itoman under his wing after a financial rescue in the 1970s
and sent in employees as presidents and board members. Itoman faced near
bankruptcy due to mounting bad loans and was taken over by a Sumitomo group
company earlier this year.
An arrest of a former Sumitomo manager on alleged illegal loans to Mitsuhiro
Kotani, a prominent stock speculator, was the trigger for his resignation,
bringing a sad end to Mr Isoda's otherwise distinguished career. Mr Isoda
first came to prominence in the 1970s by arranging the rescue of Ataka, a
troubled trading house, and then persuading Ford Motor of the US to
participate in the refinancing of Mazda Motor which faced financial
difficulties.
Mr Isoda later oversaw the rehabilitation of Daishowa Paper and Asahi
Breweries, both heavily indebted groups.
Under Mr Isoda, Sumitomo aggressively expanded overseas.
The bank invested Dollars 500m in a non-voting stake in Goldman Sachs, the
US securities company. The deal failed to bring in benefits the bank had
originally hoped, as the US Federal Reserve banned the bank from building
direct business links with Goldman.

<TEXT>
South Korea's foreign minister said yesterday North Korea would be given
more time to solve its dispute over nuclear inspections, even if the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) declares that Pyongyang is in
violation of nuclear safeguards, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The US and South Korea have previously stated that the North Korean nuclear
issue would be transferred to the United Nations Security Council once the
IAEA declared that the continuity of its inspections of the North's nuclear
facilities had been broken. The UN would then consider imposing economic
sanctions on Pyongyang.
Mr Hans Blix, the IAEA director general, said on Thursday that the
continuity of the inspection regime was close to being broken. He is
expected to deliver a report on North Korean nuclear issue to the Security
Council next week.
Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, said the timing of the
UN involvement depended not only on technical factors, such as an IAEA
declaration that its safeguards on North Korean are broken, but also on
diplomatic developments.
North Korea is now blocking routine IAEA inspections of its nuclear
facilities at Yongbyon.

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A think-tank linked to the African National Congress yesterday published
proposals to revive the South African economy which stress the central role
of the state, rather than the private sector, in triggering growth from now
until the end of the century.
Introducing the proposals from the Macroeconomic Research Group, Mr Trevor
Manuel, head of the ANC economics department, said they did not represent
ANC policy. However, ANC economists were involved in drawing them up, and
they could have a significant influence over policy formulation. One ANC
official said that some of the proposals were 'too conservative' though he
gave no details.
The research group, which includes members of the radical trade union
movement, Cosatu, as well as members of the ANC and academics from local and
foreign universities, drew up an economic model in which the role of the
state is central - in direct contradiction to the government's economic
model, which focuses on private sector investment to revive growth.
'To achieve the goals of economic growth and redistribution, the state . . .
must play a strong and active role in leading development,' the group said.
Growth would rise from 1.1 per cent in 1994 to nearly 5 per cent annually
within the first years of the next century, it said. This year's growth is
expected to total 1 per cent.
The model focuses on job creation, as well as improving access to and
quality of health, housing, and electricity. It calls for a minimum wage to
be set, but rules out any early recourse to a wealth tax, a controversial
proposal favoured by some ANC economists.
It proposes that state spending on social needs such as housing, education,
health and job creation should, using 1985 currency values as a benchmark,
nearly double from R14bn (Pounds 2.81bn) in 1992 to R26bn (Pounds 5.3bn) in
2004.
The think-tank stressed the need to maintain macro-economic balance, arguing
for prudent fiscal, monetary and balance of payments goals. It said a
post-apartheid government should resist raising personal and corporate tax
rates, but the tax system should be restructured, and should include a
multiple-rate indirect value added tax favouring the poor.

<TEXT>
King Norodom Sihanouk has withdrawn an offer to give cabinet posts to the
Khmer Rouge in return for a ceasefire. His decision abruptly ended hopes
that the offer could lead to peace talks between the radical faction and the
government, Iain Simpson writes from Phnom Penh.
It also means that renewed fighting in the central province of Kompong Thom
is likely to spread to other areas. In the past week, Khmer Rouge troops
have attacked government positions and villages in the province, retaking
positions which the government captured last year. Reports from other
provinces in the west indicate that both sides are preparing for offensives
 -a dry season pattern likely to be repeated this year.
Earlier in the week, King Sihanouk held talks in China with the nominal
leader of the Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan. The king is in hospital in
Beijing, receiving treatment for cancer. They discussed the king's proposal
to give the Khmer Rouge senior government positions in return for agreeing
to a ceasefire, giving up its army and handing over the territory it
controls.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Nigeria accused over Dollars 64m payment: Ex-minister claims
oil storage plan was unnecessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation paid out Dollars 64m
for an unnecessary oil storage facility it commissioned and subsequently
cancelled, according to Chief Philip Asiodu, the country's former oil
minister.
The scheme was 'a scandal of major proportions', Chief Asiodu said in an
interview in London, in which he quoted extensively from copies of minutes
and documents exchanged with NNPC and other officials.
In August a confidential government report expressed concern about
'leakages' in the accounts of NNPC. Nigeria exports about 1.3m barrels of
oil a day.
Chief Asiodu, a respected former permanent secretary in the oil ministry in
the 1970s who became a leading Lagos-based businessman, was appointed oil
minister at the beginning of January. He declined a further term in office
in August, when the country's interim cabinet was reshuffled and military
rule extended.
In December 1992, shortly before Chief Asiodu took office, the government
approved a proposal to hire oil tankers which would be anchored off Lagos
and hold up to 1m tons of petroleum products as a strategic reserve.
In a series of minutes to NNPC officials and to President Ibrahim Babangida,
who stepped down as Nigeria's military leader in August, Mr Asiodu called
for the cancellation of the scheme which, had it been followed through,
would have cost nearly Dollars 300m.
Chief Asiodu told NNPC officials that they had used 'bogus economics' and
argued that even if the project were to go ahead, it need not cost more than
Dollars 45m.
But he strongly recommended its cancellation, pointing out that it would not
resolve Nigeria's fuel shortages.
These, he said, were caused by internal distribution problems rather than
supply shortages.
In a minute dated May 21 and sent to Gen Babangida, Mr Asiodu wrote: 'The
matter raises. . . serious doubts about rationality, integrity and honesty
in the conduct of NNPC management.'
Mr Asiodu sent a further detailed criticism of the project to the president,
who in a minute dated June 10 agreed that it should be cancelled.
On July 30, a senior NNPC official said that, although the contract had been
terminated on July 9, NNPC was contractually committed to payments totalling
Dollars 64m to the charter company providing the tankers and handling the
project.
This included charter charges of Dollars 25m for the period December 23,
1992 to July 9, 1993, 'damages' amounting to Dollars 33m and further
obligations of Dollars 6m.
On August 9, Chief Asiodu told NNPC officials that the legality of the
contract was questionable, and warned: 'Please make it clear to all
concerned that the top management of NNPC are dealing with a scandal of
major proportions in this matter.'
Further correspondence exchanged between NNPC and Mr Asiodu suggests that
company officials ignored his directives, and had already authorised
payments totalling Dollars 16.5m to the contractors in January and February
1993.
Mr Asiodu left office on August 26.
In the interview in London Mr Asiodu also re-jected criticism of decisions
he had taken while minister on oil lifting contracts and the award of
exploration licences.
In both areas he was dealing with a backlog of claims and applications
inherited from his predecessor, said Mr Asiodu.
'If I had any skeletons to hide in the ministry, I would have chosen to
remain there,' he said.

</HEADLINE>

   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in Japan's politically controversial current account surplus is near
an end, the finance ministry said yesterday.
Annual growth in the surplus slowed to 1.4 per cent in October to Dollars
11.25bn, after a 10.2 per cent rise the previous month, the ministry
announced. That represented a 6.9 per cent decline from September's Dollars
13.3bn surplus.
Exports were stagnant or slightly down - depending on the sector - while
imports rose. 'It appears that the yen-based surplus is now in a shrinking
trend and the dollar-based surplus is likely to hit a ceiling,' said an
official.
Overall, exports rose slightly from Dollars 30.1bn from October 1992 to
Dollars 30.32bn in the same month this year, while imports increased more
strongly from Dollars 17.16bn to Dollars 17.89bn.
This could help to reduce the yen's value, given the depth of Japan's
recession, so easing the pressure on the country's exporters, said
economists.
That would be welcome news for prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa as his
government works overtime to put together another economic stimulus package.
Coalition members are aiming to finalise details of such a package by early
next week. However, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, yesterday cast
uncertainty over the timing by saying that the government must first pass a
supplementary budget, to fund the previous package.
A senior official of the government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday
admitted that the economy could shrink this year. Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, the
agency's vice minister, expected something between a slight decline and 1
per cent growth in gross national product.

FT  04 DEC 93 / In peace as in war Israel outplays the Arabs: As Arafat's
supporters lose confidence, Rabin has the upper hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Middle East peace talks at an impasse, violence in the occupied territories,
Jewish settlers on the rampage, and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary
of state, damping hopes for his visit to the region which began last night.
It all strikes a depressingly familiar note, coming so soon after the
euphoria created by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation when
they signed their declaration of principles in Washington on September 13.
But although the danger is growing that the two sides will fail to meet
their first deadline, a week on Monday, for implementing the initial stage
of the outline peace accord, the appearances are probably worse than the
reality.
By December 13, Israel and the PLO are supposed to have agreed a range of
issues which would permit the start of an Israeli troop withdrawal from much
of the Gaza Strip and an area around the West Bank town of Jericho. 'It is a
sacred date. They must respect it, or the whole peace process will be
affected,' Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said in Copenhagen this week.
From his headquarters in Tunis came the warning that negotiations over the
extent of the Israel withdrawal had reached an impasse, and US help was
needed to rescue the process.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, appears less concerned, probably
because he understands Mr Arafat's negotiating techniques and realises how
little room the PLO leader has for manoeuvre. In London on Thursday, Mr
Rabin said he would like to meet the deadline, but preferred to let it slip
by a few weeks if that meant they would achieve a precisely defined deal.
Israel, he said, would stick by its commitment to complete the first stage
of withdrawal by the next target date of April 13.
Time, however, has always been a luxury for peacemakers in the Middle East.
Fifteen Israelis and 31 Palestinians have died violently since Mr Rabin and
Mr Arafat shook hands on the south lawn of the White House, and many more
have been wounded. Opponents of the agreement will be encouraged by the
latest difficulties, and suspicions among Palestinians in the territories
about Israel's true intentions are bound to increase if the troop withdrawal
does not begin on schedule.
The danger was clear from the outset. Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin both gambled on
being able to carry with them the biggest part of their domestic
constituencies. The Israeli leader's calculations were the more finely
honed. He wrong-footed his right-wing opponents, achieved swift
parliamentary endorsement for his actions, and retains public credibility
for his determination to stand firm on security issues. Even so, the latest
poll in Israel shows support for the peace process down to 43 per cent, a
fall of over 20 per cent since September, and opposition rising at 47 per
cent.
Mr Arafat was meanwhile busy embellishing his already well-practised
impersonation of Houdini by not only escaping from the consultative chains
with which fellow Palestinians sought to bind him, but also simultaneously
ignoring the agreement with the Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese that no one
Arab partner would do a separate deal with the Israelis.
For several months before September 13, Palestinian discontent with Mr
Arafat had been approaching a crescendo, not least among those representing
the PLO at the Washington negotiations. Resignations were in the air and the
accusations were myriad. Mr Arafat was said, not for the first time, to be
alternately autocratic and indecisive, and unwilling to consult with any but
his closest colleagues. He stood accused of bringing the PLO to the verge of
financial ruin, and of coming close to wrecking the entire organisation.
Those accusations are still rife today.
But just as his leadership looked to be tottering, he made his dramatic deal
with Israel, appeared in Washington, was praised by President Clinton,
welcomed on Capitol Hill, and promised Palestinians a future state with Arab
east Jerusalem as its eternal capital. It was gripping theatre, but the plot
had only a beginning, followed by an ill-defined series of subsequent acts,
and an ending on which the authors, not to mention the other actors,
profoundly disagreed.
Getting from the starting point to the conclusion of an interim five-year
period of Palestinian self-rule, during which the final status of the
territories would be agreed, was always going to be a Herculean task. Mr
Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister and a central figure in the
process, speculated last month that it might have been easier to have
started with an agreement on how the drama would end, and then work
backwards to the White House lawn.
There is weight to his argument, more so from the Palestinian perspective.
Rifts within the wider Palestinian community have been widened by the long
wait for tangible results of the peace accord to be seen in the territories,
and by the still uncertain conclusion of the process.
While the peripatetic Mr Arafat continues to be feted in world capitals
(yesterday it was Gabon), the skilled negotiators needed to do the
difficult, detailed work have tended to be ill-prepared and poorly briefed.
The assumption of PLO headquarters in Tunis that it knows best is causing
increasing resentment among those in the territories whose leadership role
grew during the five-year uprising against Israeli occupation.
Those concerns have been exacerbated by fears Israel is seeking to dominate
the economic future of the Palestinians. In the short term there is
resentment at Israel's efforts to play a key role in the disbursement of the
Dollars 2bn in aid pledged by the international community towards rebuilding
the infrastructure of the occupied territories, and in the longer term by
its statements on the inevitability of a dependent Palestinian role.
Palestinian commentators, an increasing number of whom have turned against
Mr Arafat, delight in mocking his dilemma. 'Can a warrior negotiate as he
surrenders?' wrote one this week, suggesting that Mr Arafat can only meet
the December 13 deadline by giving way to Israeli demands. Mr Rabin has to
decide in the next few days how much of a lifeline, if any, he needs to
throw Mr Arafat to prevent a further erosion of Palestinian and, ultimately,
Israeli support for their joint initiative.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Poll surge by Russian extremists feared

<TEXT>
Reformist parties fighting Russia's parliamentary elections on December 12
are seriously concerned that a late surge by extremists will give a large
share of seats to communist and neo-fascist deputies.
Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg and the veteran democrat who now
leads the Movement for Democratic Reform - one of the four reformist parties
 -said yesterday there was now a 'very grave threat' from the communists and
even more from the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic Party, led by Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.
Mr Sobchak, who was campaigning in Krasnoyarsk, said the communists might
take 10 per cent of the seats.
He said an agreement had been reached between the four reformist parties -
Russia's Choice, the Party of Unity and Consent, the 'Yabloko' group and his
own - to withdraw candidates where it was clear one of the four was leading.
This followed a call for co-operation made by Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of
Russia's Choice.
However, it is far from clear that the democratic blocs can reach an
effective agreement not to split their votes, and Mr Sobchak said the
leadership of the four parties would meet early next week to attempt to
impose discipline on their often independent-minded and inexperienced local
organisations.
The Russian Communist Party yesterday took part in a convention of centrist
and far-left and right-wing groups held to oppose the draft Russian
constitution, which will be voted on in a referendum at the same time as the
parliamentary elections. The communist party is consistently scoring around
8 per cent in the polls and the Liberal Democrats have surged from under 2
per cent to around the same levels.
The polls all show as much as half of the electorate still undecided, while
party leaders touring the country have consistently remarked on the strength
of feeling for Mr Zhirinovsky, whose populist style has gone down well on
TV.
A spokesman for the 'Yabloko' group said last night that the four-party
agreement was only at regional level and no decision had been taken to agree
a share-out of constituencies at national level.
Mr Arkady Murashov, one of the leaders of Russia's Choice, confirmed that
the four parties would meet next week.

THE death of Pablo Escobar, chief of the Medellin cartel, does not mean drug
trafficking has ended in Colombia, though it marks a big step forward,
President Cesar Gaviria said yesterday, Sarita Kendall reports from Bogota.
'The fight against terrorism has not finished, an enormous challenge lies
ahead,' he said.
But Escobar's killing in a big police raid should hasten surrender of rival
traffickers, and representatives of some of the top Cali smugglers, rivals
to the Medellin cartel, have apparently contacted the prosecutor general's
office to discuss terms. Legislation passed recently makes surrender more
attractive, with the possibility of minimal sentences under house arrest.
Escobar was buried yesterday at a chaotic funeral punctuated by the chants
of thousands of slum-dwelling mourners who considered him a Robin Hood
figure.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Election puts lira under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness in the financial markets over the outcome of Sunday's run-offs
in local elections put the lira under pressure again yesterday.
The lira has been unsettled throughout the week because of continuing
political uncertainties and doubts about the Ciampi government's ability to
push the 1994 budget through parliament.
Yesterday the lira was being traded below the pyschological barrier of
L1,000 to the D-Mark; but then recovered to L998.
The slight improvement was attributed to signs that the government had
agreed how to tackle the 2,500 amendments tabled to the budget. This has
increased the likelihood that the legislation, reducing the public sector
deficit in 1994 to 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product, would be approved
before Christmas.
However, the likely result in Sunday's local elections remained far from
clear yesterday as the campaign closed. Opinion polls suggested candidates
backed by alliances sponsored by the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) would do well. But in Naples and Rome they are being
closely challenged by the neo-fascist MSI.
In either event the result will provide a further big shake-up in Italy's
political landscape against the backdrop of early elections next spring. The
first round on November 21 saw the collapse of the vote for the long ruling
Christian Democrats and their allies.
Sunday's elections cover almost 450 towns and cities and involve 11m voters,
nearly a quarter of the electorate.
The focus has been on Naples and Rome where the neo-fascist MSI has run a
strong campaign picking up votes from the centre parties - especially the
Christian Democrats and Socialists.
Rome magistrates yesterday notified 22 journalists and technicians working
for the RAI, the state-run television network, that there were under
investigation for alleged fraud for L250m (Pounds 100,880).
The move follows detailed inspection of expenses claims submitted by
television crews covering trouble-spot news in former Yugoslavia and
Somalia. It came on the day when the new RAI management unveiled unpopular
news that the traditional Christmas bonus of an extra month's pay, due in
early December, would be held over until the end of January to save L40bn to
pay suppliers.
The RAI is likely to lose L500bn this year and is in danger of being put
into liquidation.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Prospect of Iraqi sales hits oil price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices tumbled to new five-year lows yesterday as markets took fright at
reports that Iraqi oil exports could resume earlier than expected.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend broke through the psychological
barrier of Dollars 14 a barrel, to touch a low of Dollars 13.65 a barrel. It
later recovered in late London trading to Dollars 13.85, but sentiment
remained bearish, according to traders.
The price slide was exacerbated by news that the main Russian Black Sea oil
export terminal at Novorossiisk had reopened after being closed for three
weeks by bad weather. Its closure had been one of the few factors
underpinning prices. The main reason for yesterday's fall, however, was a
report that Iraq had shown greater flexibility in accepting UN terms for
lifting, at least partly, the embargo on oil exports.
The possibility of resumed Iraqi exports at a time of plentiful supplies and
weak prices has been a factor behind the 25 per cent slide in oil prices
over the past year.
One Gulf Arab official complained that none of the recent reports about the
return of Iraqi exports has proved true. 'The market appears to be reacting
to headlines rather than hard information,' he said.
The UN Special Commission (Unscom) said last week that by accepting its
weapons monitoring programme Iraq had removed the 'major remaining obstacle'
on weapons requirements which are linked to the oil embargo in force since
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
But it gave no indication how long Unscom will take to finish its work, and
inspectors have not precluded the possibility of turning up new evidence.
The next inspection team is unlikely to visit Iraq before February and Mr
Rolf Ekeus, who heads the commission, has suggested it would take at least
another six months from then to complete its work.
Even then there would be powerful opposition to lifting oil sanctions while
President Saddam Hussein retains power. President Clinton is opposed to such
a move in the near future and the US could be expected to cite other
examples of Iraq's aggressive intentions to justify keeping sanctions. Gulf
countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, argue that lifting the embargo
would reward an unrepentant Iraq.

<TEXT>
Venezuela's 1993 presidential campaign ended yesterday amid rumours of a
military uprising and a warning from the Clinton administration that a coup
would bring serious consequences.
The country is to vote tomorrow for a new president, the 235 members of
congress and 362 state legislators.
The US, concerned at the coup rumours and a recent wave of terrorist
bombings, sent its assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
Mr Alexander Watson, to Caracas to warn that any non-democratic government
would face an economic embargo and other sanctions. Venezuela depends
heavily on oil exports to the US.
The leading presidential contender is Mr Rafael Caldera, 77, who was
president from 1969 to 1974.
Mr Caldera, who is running as an independent, has been a strong critic of
free market reforms and privatisation.
Last year saw two failed coups and hostility to free market reforms.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Clinton welfare reform plan comes under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is nearing completion of its welfare reform plan
but already faces controversy over how to pay for the changes.
While officials believe the plan will eventually save money by encouraging
people out of the welfare system and into the workplace, it will require
considerable government spending to provide training, job schemes, childcare
and medical coverage.
Proposals to pay for these measures by cutting other programmes have already
drawn scepticism from members of Congress who feel there is little fat left
to be used in the system, but the administration is nervous about any
semblance of a tax increase to pay for the reforms.
President Bill Clinton said yesterday he was encouraged to believe that a
bipartisan welfare reform plan could be achieved by a counter-proposal from
Republicans in Congress.
'I don't agree with all of it, but there are some very good ideas in it,' he
said. 'We are moving toward making welfare a second chance, not a way of
life.'
Mr Clinton's plan, like the Republican proposal, would require welfare
recipients who have spent more than two years on the welfare rolls to work
in return for their benefits.
But debates have been vigorous on how severely the cut-off of benefits
should be applied, how the work requirement should be enforced, and how long
people could remain in government-run job schemes before being abandoned
altogether.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Central Europeans resent Nato snub: Russia and former allies
take different paths
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Frustration among central European countries over Nato's approach to
enlargement surfaced at a meeting of the 38-member North Atlantic
Co-operation Council in Brussels yesterday.
Mr Andrzej Olechowsky, the Polish foreign minister, sought to link Nato
proposals for military co-operation to a progressive expansion of the
alliance.
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic said the 'partnership for peace'
agreements proposed by Nato would not be an acceptable substitute for
membership.
They also sought to broaden the scope of the agreement beyond peacekeeping
missions to cover full co-operation in areas such as military doctrine and
planning.
Nato envisages that the agreements, to be formally proposed at a summit next
month, would be applicable to all former Warsaw Pact countries and some
other European nations, but they would lead to differing degrees of
co-operation, in some cases as a prelude to membership.
The central European countries are anxious that their membership prospects
are not held back by problems with other countries, including Russia.
Divergences between them and Moscow emerged over Russian proposals for the
future of the NACC, which serves as a forum for Nato to talk to its former
Warsaw Pact adversaries.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, proposed making the NACC into
an institution separate from Nato, acting as a defence arm for the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Aspiring Nato members, to the contrary, want to strengthen the NACC's ties
with the alliance.
Ministers yesterday agreed to extend NACC discussions to the topics of air
defence and arms procurement. However, Polish officials complained that the
scope of its work was still too restricted.
The US and its allies meanwhile failed to make apparent progress on the
elimination of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. But Mr Anatoly
Zlenko, Ukraine's foreign minister, raised the prospect of tripartite talks
between the US, Ukraine and Russia.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Top international trade negotiators in Geneva yesterday voiced concern over
delays by the US and European Union in settling long-standing disagreements
on opening their markets to farm and manufactured goods.
There was also frustration among developing country negotiators over poor
offers to open markets to their exports. Negotiators from the 116 countries
in the Uruguay Round welcomed signals from the US and the EU that talks in
Brussels this week have brought the two to the brink of agreement on a
bilateral market access deal. But several warned that a failure to finalise
the deal by Monday 'would be very serious for the round'.
Next week is the last full week of negotiation if the deadline of December
15 is to be met. Leaders elsewhere were encouraged by the week's
developments. President Francois Mitterrand of France said during a visit to
Switzerland that indications for the US-EU talks were 'optimistic'.
In Germany, which has worked hard to broker disagreements between the US and
France, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, said he was 'cautiously
optimistic for the first time' over prospects for a successful Uruguay Round
outcome.
In Copenhagen, Mr Henning Christophersen, EU finance commissioner, said the
Commission expected to meet on Monday evening to study a draft US-EU deal.
Meanwhile, most Gatt negotiators remained in the dark on details of the
prospective US-EU deal, which is expected to be unveiled after further
meetings in Brussels on Monday between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart.
Both trade negotiators adjourned on Thursday after 30 hours of almost
continuous negotiation, Mr Kantor for consultations in Washington with
President Bill Clinton, and Sir Leon to meet EU ministers. After a four-hour
Gatt discussion on the impact of the round on developing countries, Mr
Balkrishan Zutshi, India's veteran Gatt ambassador, reflected concerns of
many developing countries when he complained of 'a deep imbalance in the
exchange of concessions in areas of interest to developing countries.'
He was particularly concerned about improved market-opening offers for
textiles and clothing, and farm products - key disputed sectors in the US-EU
negotiations. He hoped the coming days would bring 'some rectification'.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Spanish cabinet agrees labour market reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish cabinet yesterday approved controversial legislation that seeks
to create employment by promoting apprenticeship schemes and to stimulate
industrial investment by removing labour market rigidities.
The initiative received a boost from the Bank of Spain which cut its
benchmark lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 9 per cent, but
it prompted strong hostility from trade union leaders who are planning a
general strike against the measures next month. There was only a lukewarm
reception from employer representatives, who say the reform does not go far
enough.
Hailed by the government as a breakthrough in its attempt to restore Spain's
competitiveness, the legislation comes at the end of a fruitless three-month
attempt to establish a consensus between employers and unions over labour
market reforms.
Yesterday's decision allows companies, from Monday, to hire unqualified
under-25-year-olds as apprentices for up to three years. These new employees
will earn 70 per cent of the minimum wage during their first working year
and incur minimal social security costs to the employers. The cabinet, under
the same decree law, also removed legal impediments to part-time work.
The government hopes these measures will have a major impact on unemployment
which stood at 3.5m, or 23 per cent of the labour force, at the end of
September according to the national statistics office. The largest group
among the unemployed total is formed by first time job seekers and, under
the former rulings, part-time workers were not counted as employees by the
statistics office.
The unions accuse the government of introducing 'junk jobs' and say that
employees on fixed contracts will be replaced by low-paid apprentices and by
part-time workers.
The main body of yesterday's legislation is formed by a draft bill that will
go before parliament early next year and which alters fundamental guidelines
on working practices and on dismissal procedures. Essentially the bill makes
redundancies in Spain, which are held to be the costliest in Europe, easier
and cheaper by broadening the terms of justifiable dismissals and by
shortening compensation from 25 to 20 days per year worked.
The draft bill also removes existing rigid statutory rules concerning the
extent of working days and holidays, overtime, job classifications and
geographical mobility for company employees.

FT  04 DEC 93 / EU to recycle the issues at fresh talks on waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands were yesterday given a fresh chance to
reach a compromise on new European Union rules for dealing with packaging
waste or risk having their ambitious recycling goals voted down by their
partners.
Environment ministers of the 12 failed to reach agreement in 21 hours of
negotiations. Now, a special council to resolve the issue has been called
for December 13, and senior EU officials warned that the 'green' trio will
be defeated under a weighted majority voting system if they cannot come to
terms with the other nine.
These nine take as their yardstick what they see as the failure of Germany's
national recycling targets. These so exceed local reprocessing capacity that
Germany is exporting huge quantities of used paper, board and plastic, with
a subsidy, to be handled in other member states.
Eight of Germany's partners complain their own efforts to build up recycling
industries are being overwhelmed by this dumping. France has threatened an
import ban, a possibility also raised by the UK House of Commons select
committee on the environment.
Because of the German programme's distortion of the single market, the
Belgian presidency of the EU, allied with the European Commission, has
lowered the recovery and recycling targets to levels Bonn and its allies
consider regressive.
But they are being offered the opportunity to stick to their more ambitious
goals if they can prove they will not be distorting trans-European flows of
waste for recycling.
Meanwhile, ministers decided on new targets to reduce car emissions by 1996,
and to speed up the phasing out of ozone layer-depleting HCFCs and methyl
bromide, used for soil fumigation.
Carbon monoxide emissions from new cars will have to fall a further 30 per
cent in petrol engines and 68 per cent in diesel engines; hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxide emissions by 55 and 38 per cent respectively; and particle
emissons from diesel engines by a further 55 per cent. Incentives will be
allowed for those countries seeking to reach these targets before 1996.
HCFCs do far less damage to the ozone layer than the chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) they are replacing in aerosols and refigerators but are now due for
total phase-out by 2015.
The UK is to ratify the Climate Change Convention, one of the key
instruments from last year's Rio Earth Summit aimed at combating global
warming, David Lascelles reports. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said a
programme to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by the year
2000 would be published early in the new year.
This week's UK budget also included measures to combat gas emissions by
increasing taxes on fuel consumption, and encouraging energy efficiency.

Lower trade barriers resulting from the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks in
Geneva would spur an extra Dollars 745bn a year in world trade in goods by
2005, a 12 per cent increase, and raise world income by at least Dollars
230bn, according to economists at the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
This income gain, which is close to other recent estimates by the OECD and
World Bank, would be broadly spread among the 116 nations taking part in the
round.
Gatt's calculations, in a report prepared for yesterday's evaluation of the
results of the round, relate only to cuts in tariff and non-tariff barriers
for goods. They 'substantially underestimate' the likely full effects of the
round, the study maintains, because they ignore the stimulus to world trade
in services, the benefits from strengthened trade rules generally and the
dynamic gains from improved business confidence and hence increased
investment and growth.
The report shows that even without the mooted tariff-cutting deal between
the US and EU due to be unveiled on Monday the market-opening package for
goods is already sizeable. Developed countries have offered to cut import
tariffs for industrial goods by 38 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. For
farm products the average reduction (after converting all trade barriers to
tariff equivalents) is 36 per cent.
The proportion of industrial goods imports entering developed countries
duty-free would more than double from 20 to 43 per cent, and rise from 22 to
45 per cent for goods from the Third World.
The Gatt report also spells out in detail the prospective gains for the 88
developing countries taking part in the Uruguay Round. It notes that rich
nations are extending lower tariff cuts on products of special interest to
poorer countries, giving an overall tariff cut on industrial goods of 32 per
cent for Third World exporters (other than the least developed) and just 19
per cent for the very poorest.
This largely reflects below-average cuts in tariffs on textiles and clothing
and on fish and fish products. Textiles and clothing is the most important
single export category for developing countries accounting for 22 per cent
of exports.
However, Gatt points out that textile exporters will benefit from the
proposed phase-out of the restrictive Multi-Fibre Arrangement governing
their exports to the west. Importers are offering to cut high textiles
tariffs, now averaging 15 per cent, by 20 per cent.
Tariffs on tropical products, an important earner for many poor countries,
are being reduced by 42 per cent.

FT  04 DEC 93 / UK boost for IMF loans to poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain said yesterday it would contribute Pounds 50m to the next phase of
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) through which the
International Monetary Fund provides concessionary lending to the poorest
developing countries.
The money, which will come from the Overseas Development Administration
budget, will go towards a subsidy account which enables the countries that
borrow from the facility to pay interest of only 0.5 per cent to the IMF.
The British contribution is expected to give a boost to negotiations in
Washington on a successor facility to replace the original ESAF. The Pounds
50m will provide an estimated 3 to 4 per cent of the cash needed for
interest subsidies in the new account. Taking the old and the new facilities
together, Britain will provide about one ninth of the funds to subsidise
interest payments.
In September, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, cast doubt on Britain's
ability to provide funds for the new ESAF because of tight budget
constraints. However, the ODA was able to provide the cash by using aid
funds earmarked for spending through the EC in 1991-92 but unused.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Kohl shrugs off talk of collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl last night rejected rumours of the imminent collapse
of his coalition in Bonn, denied that he wanted to become the next German
president, and insisted he would fight next year's general elections.
Galvanised by signs of revolt from within his own Christian Democratic Union
(CDU), and reports of rebellion from his coalition partners, the Free
Democratic Party (FDP), Mr Kohl turned on his critics in a hastily arranged
television interview.
'This coalition will survive,' he declared. 'It will do its job, and produce
an impressive record.'
He drily dismissed his long-standing rival in the CDU, Mr Kurt Biedenkopf,
the premier of the eastern state of Saxony, who had forecast a victory for
the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in the general election.
'Even Professor Biedenkopf cannot predict the outcome,' he said, although
'he expresses himself very cleverly.' As for Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former
economics minister, and alleged architect of an FDP revolt, he was simply
'peeved' because he was no longer a member of the government, Mr Kohl said.
His interview - a clear indication of how seriously Mr Kohl is taking the
rumours of rebellion - came as the latest unemployment figures showed a new
record jobless total in west Germany in November of more than 2.4m, an
increase of almost 28 per cent over the past year.
At the same time, industrial order figures showed continuing stagnation in
the economy, in spite of a more optimistic assessment of growth next year by
the Economics Ministry.
Mr Kohl admitted in his interview with SAT-1, the private television
channel, that the coalition was going through a turbulent patch, and that
the embarrassing withdrawal of Mr Steffen Heitmann, his hand-picked
candidate to be the next German president, had damaged him politically.
He denied rumours, however, that he was considering standing for the
presidency, saying he did not need any 'follow-on job', and had no intention
of quitting as chancellor.
He rejected calls for a round table of government, opposition, employers and
trade unions to resolve the economic crisis, just repeated by Mr Helmut
Schmidt, his predecessor as chancellor, as well as Mr Rudolf Scharping,
leader of the SPD.
There are no signs, however, that the economic and political crisis which
has severely dented the government's popularity is set to abate.
On the economic front, the latest unemployment figures show a jobless rate
of 7.8 per cent in west Germany, 1.6 percentage points higher than in
November 1992, and virtual stagnation in east Germany, with an unemployment
rate of 15.1 per cent.
Orders in west German manufacturing industry, which showed a recovery in
September, were down again by 0.5 per cent in October, according to the
Economics Ministry, in spite of a 4.5 per cent increase in orders from
abroad.
The ministry remains rather more optimistic on the prospects for 1994 than
the government's independent economic advisers, the so-called five wise men,
who expect zero growth.
Mr Johann Eekhoff, the state secretary for economics, told the finance
planning committee on Thursday that he expected an average growth rate of
0.5 to 1.0 per cent next year.

Canada's newly-elected Liberal government has cancelled a CDollars 700m
contract to privatise Toronto's international airport, the country's
busiest, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The deal, which involved a long-term lease over two of the airport's three
terminals, was signed with a property development and construction
consortium in the last days of the previous Progressive Conservative
government.
But the contract has been strongly criticised on both commercial and
political grounds.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Interest rate cut boosts franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc strengthened yesterday following the announcement that the
Bank of France will cut its leading interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point on Monday.
The announcement, which will reduce the Bank of France's intervention rate
to 6.2 per cent and its 5-to-10 day rate to 7.25 per cent, followed the news
on Thursday of a similar cut in the Bundesbank's repurchase rate.
It represents a continuation of the cautious policy pursued by the French
authorities since last summer's exchange rate mechanism crisis of protecting
the value of the franc by shadowing Germany on interest rates.
The French currency, which has rallied in recent weeks, was bolstered by the
news to close at FFr3.437 against the D-Mark compared with FFr3.446 the
previous day. This leaves the franc close to its old ERM floor of FFr3.4305.
The Paris stock market was boosted by the news. The CAC 40 Index, which has
faltered recently on concern about the slow progress of interest rate
reduction and fears of an impasse over the Gatt negotiations, rose by 1.29
per cent during the day to close at 2,188.4.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Delors to seek Pounds 76bn jobs fund: 'Brussels bonds' will
finance EU projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will present plans
at next week's EU summit to spend more than Ecu100bn (Pounds 76bn) over the
next five years on job-creating rail, road and telecommunications projects.
The plans are expected to include a request to raise 'Brussels bonds' on the
international capital markets, with the Commission playing a lead
co-ordinating role.
The aim is to raise cheap loans using the EU's favourable credit rating. It
may provoke opposition from the UK and Germany, which remain wary of such
'off-budget' financing.
It may also provoke hostility from the European Investment Bank, which has
consistently rejected Brussels' arguments that plans for high-speed trains,
roads and bridges are being starved of funds.
Mr Delors, though, is said to be determined to press the case for annual
investment of Ecu20bn-30bn in trans-European networks. Some of the money has
already been earmarked within existing budgets, but officials said a new
financial instrument was required to make Europe more competitive, forge
common European actions under the Maastricht treaty and tackle mass
unemployment.
Those themes will feature in Mr Delors' white paper on employment, growth
and competitiveness, which will be submitted to a special meeting of the
Commission tomorrow before being presented to European leaders at the
two-day Brussels summit starting on Friday.
EU finance ministers have amended or blocked Mr Delors' proposals for
creating soft-loan facilities to help small businesses, stimulate
private-sector investment in infrastructure and create 15m new jobs by the
year 2000.
Now the Commission president plans a direct appeal to European leaders. He
will point to Article 129 in the Maastricht treaty, which provides for
interest rate subsidies to fund trans-European networks, and urge a joint
approach.
At this week's Franco-German summit, President Francois Mitterrand said he
had agreed with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the principle of an EU-wide
borrowing plan. Mr Kohl however, said any proposal needed to be carefully
studied.
He noted that only half of an Ecu7bn fund created by the European Investment
Bank had been allocated this year for trans-European networks. It was
important not to create a 'new pot' into which money would be poured just
for show.
Commission officials were confident of defeating UK opposition to heavy
capital investment. They noted the campaign of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, against the 1991 Urban Waste Water directive,
which he claimed would cost Pounds 10bn. 'If you had this money available,
you could mobilise private finance and help to reduce risk,' one official
said.
EIB experts argue that Brussels is underestimating the power of Green
pressure groups to delay big road and rail projects.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Dublin summit revives search for peace plan: Major and
Reynolds aim for joint declaration on Ulster after 'frank talks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish prime ministers last night revived their stalled
Northern Ireland peace initiative with a plan for a joint declaration of
principles designed to persuade the IRA to halt its campaign of violence.
Nevertheless, intense talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds at
the Dublin summit still left the two governments without a detailed formula
to bridge the gap between the aspirations of Irish nationalists and
Britain's guarantee to Ulster Unionists of a veto over a united Ireland.
After what both leaders admitted had been a 'frank' exchange over Britain's
contacts this year with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, they
acknowledged that it might eventually prove impossible to bridge differences
over the future of the province. 'We cannot be certain we will resolve those
difficulties,' Mr Major said.
He and Mr Reynolds discussed different texts in detail, and said they
remained committed to further talks. That raised hopes that a joint
statement could be agreed when they meet in Brussels next week or during a
session in London pencilled in before Christmas.
Balancing the two leaders' caution, Mr Reynolds said: 'We got through quite
a lot of very serious work, very productive work.'
The Irish prime minister insisted during the talks that agreement on the
joint declaration was essential to secure an end to violence by the IRA and
set the stage for detailed talks with the political parties in Northern
Ireland.
He said afterwards: 'At the end of the day, peace is paramount.'
It is understood that the draft of the declaration includes a renewed offer
to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations in return for an end to terrorism.
Mr Major also refused to dismiss the possibility of further bilateral
contacts with Republican leaders. But he insisted that the IRA could not
dictate the terms of any agreement. 'There is no question of bargaining for
an end to violence,' he said.
Earlier Mr Major had faced sharp criticism from Mr Reynolds over the London
government's covert contacts with Sinn Fein for much of this year. The Irish
leader said their sharp exchanges on the issue had 'cleared the air' and
paved the way for further negotiations.
At the heart of the day-long talks was an attempt, so far unsuccessful, to
find language that would recognise both the right of the Irish people to
determine their own future and the insistence of the Ulster Unionists that
nothing should be done to undercut Northern Ireland's place in the United
Kingdom.
Mr Reynolds repeated his pledge that the Republic accepted that the consent
of the Unionist majority was essential to any change in the constitutional
status of the province. He confirmed that he wanted referendums in both the
north and south of Ireland to endorse any agreement reached by the two
governments.
Mr Major will now seek to reassure Unionist leaders that he has not agreed
anything to undermine Ulster's place in the UK. Mr Reynolds appeared
determined to maintain the pressure on Mr Major to agree language that would
give the IRA an excuse to call a permanent end to violence. The Irish leader
believes that such a cessation could transform the atmosphere in both north
and south and pave the way for a durable political settlement.

FT  04 DEC 93 / Big fall in US jobless lifts hopes for robust recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The sharpest fall in the US unemployment rate for a decade yesterday
prompted claims that the US recovery, after stuttering for two years, is
finally entering a benign phase of robust, non- inflationary growth.
The Labour Department said the jobless rate fell from 6.8 per cent in
October to 6.4 per cent last month, the lowest level for three years. The
figures - the latest in a string of buoyant economic statistics - surprised
Wall Street analysts who expected a decline of only 0.1 or 0.2 percentage
points.
Bond and share prices, however, were little changed as the figures confirmed
recent signs of accelerating growth.
'We are moving in the right direction,' President Bill Clinton told
supporters in Washington. 'We have unemployment down, investment up, no
inflation and low interest rates.'
Ms Laura Tyson, White House chief economist, said the pace of growth had
picked up and was sustainable. Gross domestic product was likely to grow at
an annual rate of more than 3 per cent this quarter. The faster recovery
would continue next year, without putting upward pressure on inflation, now
just under 3 per cent. Oil prices were down, commodity prices were soft and
wage pressure was mild. 'The evidence is compelling that inflation won't
increase,' she said.
Yesterday's figures were uniformly encouraging. Non-farm payroll employment
was reported up 208,000 last month, against projections of an increase of
about 170,000. Manufacturing employment was up 30,000, the second monthly
increase after declines earlier this year. Hours worked rose to a record
level, suggesting a strong gain in industrial production. But there was
little sign of upward pressure on wages.
The Commerce Department said the official index of leading indicators - a
guide to future trends - rose 0.5 per cent in October after solid gains in
the two preceding months. Factory orders rose 1.2 per cent in October to
register their third consecutive monthly gain.
Many Wall Street analysts share the White House's confidence. The consensus
is that the economy will grow at an annual rate of 4-5 per cent this quarter
from 2.7 per cent in the third quarter. Growth is expected to moderate early
next year but then regain momentum. Real gross domestic product is expected
to rise by 3 per cent or slightly more over the year.
Views diverge on the Federal Reserve's likely response. If inflation figures
remain subdued, many analysts expect the Fed to postpone an increase in
short-term rates, now 3 per cent, until well into next year. Others believe
the Fed will begin nudging rates higher on the grounds that
inflation-adjusted rates are too low.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UN report paints grim picture for disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's 290m disabled people suffer appalling discrimination, abuse and
neglect and in developing countries only 3 per cent of those in need receive
conventional rehabilitation services, according a United Nations report
published today*.
The report, timed to coincide with the first UN International Day of
Disabled Persons, says the number of people with severe or moderate
disabilities is expected to double to 573m by the year 2025 because of
rising population and increasing numbers of old people, from 5.5 per cent of
the total population to 6.7 per cent.
Of these, 435m will live in developing countries, compared with 200m today.
Every fourth family in a developing country has a disabled family member,
the report estimates. In some countries babies born with a disability are
put to death. Disabled children often die early from neglect.
Providing professional rehabilitation services for all who need them in
developing countries would even now cost Dollars 60bn or Dollars 1,000 per
person, the report notes. Providing home helps for the increased number of
elderly in rich nations could cost 13 per cent of total national income by
2025.
Dr Einar Helander, the report's author, argues instead for a 'common-sense'
community-based approach within a national framework. 'We have to create a
caring society,' he says. 'The family and the community are the best
resource.'

FT  03 DEC 93 / Repo rate cut by cautious Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank surprised European financial markets yesterday by announcing
a quarter of a percentage point cut in the securities repurchase agreement,
the 'repo' rate which determines money market interest rates, without
delivering cuts in the 'official' Lombard and discount rates.
Meeting for the penultimate time this year, the bank's policy-making council
fixed the repo rate at 6 per cent for the next five weeks, down from 6.25
per cent.
Although markets were initially disappointed at the decision not to trim the
internationally sensitive discount rate, the repo rate cut was enough to
trigger easing in other European countries.
The Dutch and Belgian central banks announced they would cut rates from
today. Dutch official rates will be cut by a quarter of a point and Belgian
rates by between a quarter and half a point.
In Germany, economists said the move to maintain the repo rate at 6 per cent
over the five weeks to January 5 maintained the momentum of cuts in German
interest rates while still signalling caution about the pace of monetary
easing.
'It shows very clearly that the will to cut interest rates further is very
strong,' said Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist of the German arm of the
Industrial Bank of Japan. 'On the other hand it indicates that they have no
wish to endanger their credibility as they may have done with a large cut in
the discount rate.'
Mr Kermit Schoenholtz, at Salomon Brothers International in London, said the
move 'sets the stage for another official rate cut, most likely in early
1994 if not before'.
The move comes against a background of slowing inflation and economic
stagnation in Germany, conditions conducive to further rate cuts. The rate
of growth in broad money, the M3 indicator watched as an indicator of
inflationary developments, is slowing but is still outside the target range.
The Bundesbank's policy-making council will set its target for M3 growth at
its meeting on December 16. In November, M3 grew at an annualised,
seasonally adjusted rate of 6.8 per cent, above the central bank's 6.5 per
cent ceiling.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Smoke of battle masks gains for EU contenders: The stormy
membership talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uproar among the four countries negotiating entry to the European Union over
the Commission's plans to deal with their higher farm subsidies is obscuring
the benefits of the proposed scheme for both sides - as Brussels officials
anticipated and some negotiators for the four applicants are coming to
realise.
The Commission last week said it wanted to align farm prices in Austria,
Sweden, Finland and Norway with EU levels immediately they enter the Union.
Agriculture subsidies among the four applicants range from 25 per cent
higher than EU prices in Austria, to nearly 100 per cent more in Norway. The
difference would be paid through direct compensation to farmers, with the
bill picked up by the applicant countries, the Commission says.
The sensitive farm issue could make or break the accession negotiations,
especially for Finland, Austria and Norway. All the applicants insist on
special treatment for their Arctic and Alpine farmers for a mixture of
social, national security, cultural and environmental reasons as much as for
economic considerations. The Nordic countries, in particular, are determined
to keep as much of their population as possible in their empty and
inhospitable northern territories, through lavish farm and regional
subsidies.
With the partial exception of Sweden, which has already brought its farm
subsidy regime closer to EU levels, the applicants reject EU suggestions
that alignment should be immediate and that they alone should pay their
farmers the difference without help from the Union budget.
The row has already swung Finnish public opinion marginally against EU entry
(41 per cent opposed, 36 per cent for and 23 per cent undecided) for the
first time since the Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty at their first
referendum on it in June 1992. This turnaround is particularly alarming
because Finland is the only one of the four countries which EU negotiators
were practically certain would get entry past its voters.
Yet negotiators on both sides in Brussels seem hardly fussed by the
controversy, and there are good reasons why.
Neither the Commission nor the Council of Ministers of the Twelve could have
been expected to go into a negotiation essentially about money by proffering
a cheque up-front. Senior EU officials know full well that the Brussels
budget will have to pick up a portion of the farm compensation costs -
estimated at Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.7bn) for the four countries as a whole. The
only question is how much, and that will be for negotiation, in relation to
how much the four rich applicants put into the EU budget.
As things stand, taxpayers and consumers in the applicant countries foot the
entire bill for their expensive food. Under the Commission proposal,
consumers stand to gain from lower prices, and treasuries will gain from an
EU subvention, however much it is.
The four applicants and the Twelve had nothing to gain from the alternative
scheme, used in all previous European enlargements. This was to iron out all
price differences through levies raised at the border until alignment was
completed. But that route, defended by DG6, the Brussels agriculture
directorate, requires the retention of borders for the new entrants, and
would compromise the EU's single market.
Moreover, if the Uruguay Round is concluded this month, the four applicants
will have to cut their level of farm subsidy by about a third over the next
six years. The Commission's proposal for direct compensation payments to
farmers - exempted from the Gatt cuts under last year's EU-US Blair House
accord - would by contrast protect Nordic and Alpine farmers' incomes from
the cuts, Brussels officials say.
These arguments, in the Brussels view, should be saleable to the applicant
countries' electorates. In presentational terms, a persistent worry
throughout the accession negotiations has been that applicant governments
would be seen as selling out their national interests if they fell in too
readily with EU requirements.
The way the farm subsidy controversy has now been set up should suit their
purposes: not only will they almost certainly win tangible concessions, but
they will be seen to have given battle and to have won.

FT  03 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conglomerate Hanson recorded its biggest turnover since the UK general
election after announcing disappointing full-year results which prompted a
rash of forecast cuts. The shares retreated from their all-time high to
finish 16 lower at 268 1/2 p on 52m turnover after the conglomerate revealed
a fall in earnings per share and profits down to Pounds 1.016bn, from Pounds
1.286bn previously. Analysts' forecasts ranged between Pounds 1.05bn and
Pounds 1.15bn.
Hanson's decision not to raise its dividend for the first quarter of the
current financial year came as a particular shock to the market. There was
also surprise over the loss prompted by currency shifts, which was about
Pounds 100m greater than expected, and the damage caused by the Peabody coal
strike, around Pounds 15m worse than forecast.
Analysts pointed out that the group failed to benefit from Wednesday's surge
in share prices so the stock was down about 8 per cent against the market
over two days. Forecasts were cut by around Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.1bn for
the current year, although conglomerates specialists said that with a yield
of 5.3 per cent the stock offered some value.
Racal Electronics delivered the second big blow to the electronics sector
this week, shocking the market with a Pounds 400,000 loss at the half way
stage, against a comparable Pounds 23.2m profit and market expectations of
profits which had ranged from around Pounds 16m to Pounds 22m. The interim
dividend was held at 1.5p; analysts had expected an increase to around 1.7p.
The shares plunged on the news to a year's low of 158p before stabilising
and closing a net 29 down at 160p. Turnover of 20m was the stock's highest
single day's activity since August 1992.
Dealers said the market had begun to factor in full-year underlying profits
forecasts of around Pounds 45m, but warned that Racal's once large fan club
was waning by the minute.
Results from Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks giant, came safely
within market expectations and helped the shares advance 13 to 430p in busy
turnover of 10m.
Analysts said that in addition to a positive results meeting, the group's
dramatic turnround of its cash position had done much to improve investor
confidence.
Boddington added 10 at 275p on vague talk that Bass might be in a predatory
mood. The latter stayed at 537p.
Ladbroke remained friendless, declining 7 to 144p in a second consecutive
day's huge turnover of 20m. Ladbroke attempted to mend fences yesterday over
the share sale by one director and worries over the dividend.
However, leisure analysts said investors remain nervous over what is
perceived as the group's 'bunker mentality'.
Granada improved 14 to 489p on speculation that LWT, a rumoured bid target
of the north-west broadcaster, may be lining up a bid for Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees TV (YTT). Such a move would mean Granada would not need to tap
shareholders for its predicted move on LWT, which slipped 12 to 581p. YTT
moved up 4 to 183p.
Disappointment with the net asset value at MEPC shook the shares, which
tumbled 27 to 523p, the biggest faller in the FT-SE 100 Index, in busy
volume of 4.8m.
MEPC came in with an nav of 416p, compared with one bullish broker's 485p
and the market range clustered around 450p. However, Mr Graham Stanley at
NatWest Securities blamed the low nav on the timing of the group's
valuation, which was done too early to benefit fully from the recovery in
the sector and the improvement in property yields.
Food manufacturers wilted in the wake of the poor results from Argyll Group
on Wednesday, with which the supermarket operator hinted at wringing keener
prices out of its suppliers. Booker retreated 8 to 396p and United Biscuits
7 1/2 to 332 1/2 p, both seemingly subject to Hoare Govett downgrades. Stock
overhangs were said to have added further pressure to Northern Foods, off 11
at 212p, and Tate &amp; Lyle, 5 adrift at 401p.
Argyll's decision to depreciate its store values hit other supermarket
groups. Asda lost 2 at 50p, Tesco 5 at 193 1/2 p and J. Sainsbury the same
at 404p.
A top slice recommendation, believed to be by Smith New Court, was said to
be behind a 17 fall in P&amp;O to 610p.
Heavy buying pushed Abbey National up 13 to 437p on 9.5m traded, while TSB,
the next of the big banks to report, closed 7 higher at 228p with turnover
reaching a very heavy 17m. Standard Chartered jumped 33 to 1110p, although
there were hints that a big sell note on the stock was imminent.
Fine china group Royal Doulton began trading in the market following the
demerger from Pearson, and some 23m shares changed hands. Dealers said the
shares were initially offered at around 212p, commenced trading at 193p and
closed at 207p.
Pearson was marked down by 21p as, under the terms of the demerger, each
shareholder receives one Royal Doulton share for every 10 Pearson shares. Ex
Doulton the shares closed 3 higher at 597p.
Heywood Williams climbed 40 to a peak 384p on the back of a US acquisition,
financed by a Pounds 55m rights issue.

FT  03 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend boost for RBOS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Mr Peter Wood, a director of Royal Bank of Scotland and one of the
founders of the bank's hugely successful Direct Line telephone insurance
business, had bought more than 2m shares in the bank set the seal on a
scintillating performance by RBOS shares.
They were easily the best performer in the FT-SE 100, racing up to a peak
435p before reacting to close 33 higher at 428p, a rise of almost 8.5 per
cent. Turnover in the stock reached 16m, by far the highest in a single
trading session since last August when Scottish Equitable sold a block of
20m shares at 286p.
Earlier the market had lifted the shares substantially after RBOS announced
preliminary profits of Pounds 265m and a 25 per cent increase in the
dividend, both figures being well in excess of the most optimistic analysts'
forecasts, which ranged up to around Pounds 230m. Earnings predictions for
the current year were quickly hoisted to above the Pounds 450m mark, with
dividend estimates being lifted to around 13p.
Bank specialists focused on RBOS's rapidly improving bad debt situation, and
its successful cost control moves. They also pointed to the huge benefits to
the banks of a low interest rate climate in the UK.

FT  03 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Futures continued to show very high turnover and a healthy premium to the
cash market in spite of yesterday's retrenchment in financial markets,
writes Peter John.
The December Footsie futures contract opened at 3,262, some 3 points above
the previous close, and leapt to a high of 3,277.
Dealers said much of the rise sprang from a Pounds 300m investment last week
in equities following the launch of new Lloyd investment trusts. They said
one securities house had bought futures to hedge the deal and that had
combined with the general rush to get into the market.
Yesterday, the buying pressure eased and, also, institutions reversed put
option deals made earlier in the month as protection against the possibility
of a hit from changes in advance corporation tax. The December contract
closed near the day's low at 3,243.
However, turnover of 19,822 contracts was exceptionally high once again and
December traded well above estimated fair value. The premium is estimated to
be at par with the cash market or even a small discount during the current
account and it was 20 points over by the close.
Equally, volume of more than 66,000 lots in traded options was down on
Wednesday's level but still well above average. Hanson, which announced
disappointing full-year results yesterday topped the list of stock options
with 4,332 lots dealt.
Banks were also in demand as the underlying stocks moved higher. The largest
single deal was in Barclays, where 2,000 March 600 put options were sold at
the equivalent of 21p a share, a bullish trade.

FT  03 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Advance checked as the profit-takers
appear - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The six-day bull run on the London stock market met its expected check
yesterday, but not until it had scaled new trading peaks early in the
session as it continued its positive response to this week's Budget speech
from the UK chancellor of the exchequer. With government bonds in retreat
and pressures from stock index futures reduced somewhat, profit-taking in
the stock market was no great surprise. But trading volume remained high and
the tone positive.
The FT-SE 100 Index was 25.1 points up at a new intraday peak of 3,258.3
within the first half-hour of official trading. Although the December
futures contract maintained a good premium over the cash market, it
exercised less pressure because a severe squeeze on futures positions came
to an end.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave its chief lending rates unchanged,
although it cut its repo rate, was no surprise, but London traders took the
welcome opportunity to mark share prices down in an attempt to attract stock
and replenish trading books which have been depleted over the past week.
As the City's optimistic reception for the Budget was consolidated in the
stock market, attention turned back to the company news front. Trading
results from Hanson, Racal, and MEPC brought a heavy reaction from the
respective share prices. However, the banking sector blossomed after Royal
Bank of Scotland increased its dividend payment.
The battle weariness of the London market prevented it from sharing in the
continued advance across other European bourses, and a weak opening on Wall
Street gave no help. After drifting steadily down through the second half of
the session, the FT-SE 100 finished a net 9.3 off at the day's low point of
3,223.9.
The weight of profit-taking was indicated by another heavy volume of shares
through the Seaq electronic trading system; the total of 1.0484bn shares
remained among this year's highest, closely trailing Wednesday's 1.2533bn.
On Wednesday, when the market was making its considered response to the
chancellor's measures, retail, or customer, business in equities jumped to
Pounds 2.8bn, a daily total not seen since sterling's unexpected departure
from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992; the next
comparisons would be with the heady days of the market crash of October
1987.
Demand for the second line issues, which are slower to feel the effects of a
change of direction in the market, remained good and the FT-SE Mid 250
Index, although off the top at the close, was 0.3 up at a new peak of
3,565.9.
Confidence that UK base rates will be reduced again early in the new year
remained unshaken, although it was left to the bank stocks to shine among
the interest rate-related issues. The international blue chips had a
relatively calm session, with investors content to take profits here and
there. There was little activity in oil shares as the market continued to
show caution towards weak crude oil prices. However, some US interest in oil
issues was reported late in the London session.
Equity strategists remained bullish in their assessment of prospects for the
post-Budget stock market. The Footsie has gained more than 6 per cent since
investors turned bullish just a few days before the Budget speech, and
investors now appear well satisfied with the measures announced by the
chancellor.

FT  03 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners take driving seat in
Stockholm - Christopher Brown-Humes says the market has hit a rocky patch
after its earlier surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A market registering a 50 per cent gain this year was always likely to hit a
rocky patch, so there should be little surprise at what has happened in
Sweden during the last month. Shares have fallen by 6 per cent with daily
trading showing considerable volatility, although the Affarsvarlden index
picked up 3.5 yesterday to 1,345.5.
For many observers this is an overdue consolidation, after a year of
steadily rising share prices. Others believe it could be a sign of a more
fundamental weakening which could last well into next year.
The turbulence indicates that Stockholm will have to get used to greater
volatility, now that the proportion of shares held by foreign owners has
risen to around 25 per cent, from just 10 per cent at the end of 1991.
As many Swedish institutions are long term holders, selling and buying of
Swedish shares by foreigners has become a key to whether prices rise or
fall.
The weight of foreign buying and the fall in interest rates are the main
factors to have driven equity prices higher this year. In the first 10
months foreigners were net buyers of SKr28.2bn (Dollars 3.3bn) worth of
Swedish shares and they accounted for 28 per cent of the trading volume in
Stockholm. In the same 1992 period, foreign net buying amounted to just
SKr9.4bn and the foreign element of turnover was 18.5 per cent.
Clear evidence that foreigners are now steering the price of Swedish shares
to a much greater extent came several weeks ago, after a collapse in the
price of Ericsson, the telecommunications group.
The fall was triggered by heavy selling in New York, when it emerged that
full-year profits would not reach the dizzy heights expected by some
analysts.
Since then, Ericsson, which accounts for some 10 per cent of the stock
exchange value, has seen its shares fall by 15 per cent to SKr355 at
yesterday's close.
According to Mr Leif Vindevag, head of research at the Stockholm exchange:
'Ericsson was the trigger for a broader reappraisal of the Swedish market,
where many felt that prices had risen too much.' However, the market's
turbulent performance also reflects broader international concerns,
particularly the outlook for US interest rates, as well as specifically
domestic issues such as Volvo's controversial plans to merge its car and
truck operations with Renault.
Volvo's shares rose by a cumulative 17.1 per cent over the last three
trading days as opposition to the merger grew and institutional investors
began to throw their weight against it. The shares, traded as ADRs in the
US, surged by 11.9 per cent in early trading last night in immediate
reaction to news that Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar and four other board members had
quit, and that the merger was off, before slipping back to finish the
session a net Dollars 2 7/8 higher at Dollars 55 3/8 .
But in the broad shake-out afflicting Swedish stocks, the engineering sector
has fallen by 11 per cent, forestry by 3 per cent, pharmaceuticals by 7 per
cent and the banks and insurance sector by 8 per cent.
A number of factors suggest the downturn may be short-lived. They include
the likelihood that short-term interest rates will continue to fall, and the
prospects for much improved profitability among the big exporters during
1994. Domestic buyers at least should be in plentiful supply as a result of
changes to individual pensions legislation and reforms which will halve the
capital gains tax on equities and scrap taxes on dividends from Swedish
companies for domestic residents from January.
Analysts, however, are divided over where the market is heading. Mr Joe
Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, expects the
market to pick up momentum again, against a background of a continuing fall
in short-term interest rates and a likely strengthening of the krona.
But Mr Richard Davidson, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in
London, is bearish. He cites political worries linked to next year's
election, which may well see the return of a Social Democrat government, and
concern over the size of the country's borrowing requirement, which is close
to 16 per cent of GNP. Mr Davidson also believes the market is overvalued on
fundamentals.
He predicts a further 10 per cent drop in the market over the next three
months and a flat performance over the coming year.

FT  03 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Firm close ahead of
employment figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks edged higher yesterday after meandering in a narrow range ahead of
today's eagerly awaited report on November employment, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 5.03 firmer at 3,702.11 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 1.22 at 463.11. The Nasdaq composite again
outperformed other indices, adding 2.92 at 766.73. NYSE volume came to
256.4m shares.
A batch of second-tier economic figures, which were generally in line with
forecasts, set a positive tone for early trading. The Commerce Department
said that personal income had risen 0.6 per cent from September to October
on a seasonally adjusted basis, while personal consumption climbed 0.8 per
cent. Initial claims for state unemployment benefit last week showed a
modest decline.
Conversely, sales of new homes in October dipped 6.5 per cent from the
previous month. However, the fresh economic data left little impression.
Instead, stocks reacted to a mid-morning downturn in the US Treasury market,
where apprehension about today's report on November employment was in
evidence. A surprisingly strong showing is likely to send bond prices
sharply lower.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue recovered somewhat
and equities inched back into positive territory in the final hour of a
subdued session.
With the release of November sales figures by the big store groups,
retailing stocks were among the most actively traded. Analysts found little
encouragement for the Christmas season in their overall performance. Among
the big losers was The Limited, which posted a 7 per cent decline in
same-store sales. The stock plunged Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 18 as its
rating was lowered by at least two securities houses. Sears Roebuck shed
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 in spite of reporting good sales figures.
Dillard was down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 39 1/2 .
JC Penney was unchanged at Dollars 54 1/4 despite a 13 per cent gain in
same-store sales. Talbots, a newly listed stock, stayed at Dollars 26 5/8
even though its comparable-store sales were up 16.1 per cent.
Semiconductor issues were hit by concern over a slowdown in orders. Texas
Instruments lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 64, and National Semiconductor fell
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/8 in heavy trading.
Canada
Toronto also managed just a minor gain after Wednesday's sharp rise. The TSE
300 index was finally 5.9 ahead at 4,226.3, with advances narrowly leading
declines by 394 to 366. Volume amounted to 61.1m shares valued at CDollars
670.9m.
Industrial products recorded the day's biggest change, adding 1.31 per cent.
Mitel, CDollars  3/4 higher at CDollars 8 1/2 , said it has received a
multi-million dollar order for its call controller product from Diana Corp.

FT  03 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes for economic boost
spur 1.9% rise in Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares surged in the morning on reports of an additional stimulus package,
but later lost half their gain on profit-taking and position squaring, and
the Nikkei average closed 1.9 per cent up, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average added 333.44 at 17,458.75. The Topix index put on
21.25, or 1.5 per cent, at 1,465.12, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 0.25 to 1,180.12.
The Nikkei declined to a low for the day of 17,073.81 in early trading, but
later jumped to a high of 17,887.29 on reports that the government would
announce an emergency stimulus package containing an income tax cut and
relaxation of land transaction taxes. Reports that Mr Masayoshi Takemura,
the chief cabinet secretary, had hinted on a cut in the official discount
rate also encouraged investors.
Investment trust funds and companies were seen actively buying shares.
However, the rally lost steam as Mr Takemura later denied that he had
mentioned a rate cut, and a fall in the futures market in the afternoon
prompted arbitrage selling and profit-taking.
Volume expanded to 470m shares from 368m, while rises led falls by 952 to
120, with 62 issues unchanged.
Mr Jiro Saito, vice-minister of finance, denied that the government had
played a role in the rebound of stock prices. Local newspapers have been
suggesting that the government was trying to prop up the market by ordering
life assurers to buy shares.
An official meeting between Mr Setsuya Tabuchi, former chairman of Nomura
Securities, and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, on Tuesday, when
the Nikkei plunged to a year's low, is also believed to have been staged by
government officials in order to revive confidence.
In spite of the overall rise, some bank shares were weak. The Nikkei banking
index rose only 1.3 per cent, with Industrial bank of Japan down Y40 to
Y2,820 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank off Y30 at Y1,940. Gainers included Fuji
Bank, up Y50 at Y1,950, and Sakura Bank, Y20 ahead at Y1,480.
East Japan Railway firmed Y8,000 to Y435,000 and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone gained Y12,000 at Y741,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 479.59 to 19,456.59 in volume of 32.7m
shares. Roundup
The Pacific Basin region was generally firmer yesterday.
HONG KONG finished slightly lower as sharp early gains were erased after
Governor Chris Patten announced the introduction of a partial bill on his
controversial electoral reform package.
The Hang Seng index closed 15.83 easier at 9,238.20, having been 113 points
ahead in the morning and 88 points up at midsession. Turnover dipped to
HKDollars 5.14bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 5.32bn.
December futures slid to a low for the day of 9,150 after the Patten speech,
but recovered slightly to finish a net 170 down at 9,170.
TAIWAN was lifted by a wave of strong buying just before the close, and the
market ended 2.5 per cent higher after hectic trade, extending Wednesday's
gain of 2.6 per cent.
The market index moved ahead 110.90 to end at its intraday peak of 4,579.24,
the highest finish since May 13. Turnover increased to TDollars 60.53bn, the
heaviest since April.
Pulp and paper stocks led the advance on expectations that the industry,
which slumped this year, will recover on firmer product prices next year.
Chung Hwa Pulp closed the day's limit up at TDollars 21.40.
KUALA LUMPUR saw the day's highs eroded by late profit-taking, although the
composite index still ended 2.09 ahead at a new closing peak of 1,017.51.
Volume rose to 693.3m shares from the previous day's 601.5m.
SINGAPORE was spurred to a record close by foreign institutional buying, the
Straits Times Industrial index adding 25.24 at 2,131.25.
Early Japanese institutional buying set the mood for the market's advance in
the morning, but later trading was subdued by profit-taking.
AUSTRALIA rose strongly, encouraged by gains elsewhere in the region. The
All Ordinaries index climbed 41.9, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,047.3. Turnover
amounted to ADollars 557.4m.
More heavy trading in the shares of Goodman Fielder, the food group, led to
speculation that someone may be amassing a stake, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney. The stock closed 6 cents higher at ADollars 1.68 in volume of 11m
shares and has now gained almost 10 per cent during the past fortnight.
SEOUL closed near to the 800 level on across the board selling. The
composite index shed 7.58 to 801.17. Turnover totalled Won682.9bn.
Posco, the steel group, saw the day's heaviest volume with 2.2m shares
changing hands, and rose to a day's high of Won37,800 before closing
unchanged at Won36,500.
MANILA advanced strongly, with the composite index rising 72.13 to 2,395.89
in turnover of 1.1bn pesos.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone appreciated 20 pesos to 1,755 pesos and
PT &amp; T 1 peso to 9.40 pesos.
NEW ZEALAND was again boosted by demand for forestry issues, which left the
NZSE-40 capital index 38.78, or 1.9 per cent, higher at 2.079.30 in strong
turnover.

FT  03 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Zurich set
record highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany and Switzerland were in record territory, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT slipped back after the Bundesbank announced that it was not making
a cut in the discount rate but, supported by other factors including the
stronger dollar, ended the day at a record high.
The DAX index closed 20.66 higher at 2,110.53 after a high of 2,115.64 and a
low of 2,104.05. Turnover was strong at DM11.5bn.
Mr Patrick Shields at NatWest Securities commented that the Bundesbank had
signalled, by setting the repo rate at 6 per cent until January, that there
would be no further move on interest rates until the new year.
In the market he noted activity in RWE, the shares adding DM11 to DM488,
with some institutions taking positions ahead of the group's dividend
payment next week.
The strength of the dollar helped Daimler make DM9.50 to DM743.50, together
with rumours that Airbus might be in the running to win a US contract.
The banking sector continued to make ground with Dresdner showing a 16 per
cent increase in 10 month profits, the shares gaining DM1 to DM445; but
Hypobank, which also announced good figures, slipped 30 pfg to DM480.50.
Commerzbank added DM2.50 to DM370.50.
ZURICH remained firm, although off its best levels, and the SMI index added
12.9 to a second consecutive record high of 2,787.2, with Wednesday's better
than expected economic data continuing to provide support.
CS Holding, the most expansive of the Swiss banks, shed SFr65 to SFr3,600 as
it declined comment on market rumours that it planned to take a stake in
Commerzbank. Analysts were divided over the logic of such a move: they were
cautious about dismissing such a market rumour, but one commented that it
would be a move away from the Swiss bank's core business.
Elektrowatt, part of the CS Holding group, rose SFr25 to SFr3,775, befiting
from analysts' recommendations.
Drug issues put in a strong performance. Ciba-Geigy advanced SFr10 to SFr837
and Sandoz put on SFr40 to SFr3,910. Roche certificates firmed SFr70 to
SFr6,140 after the recent consolidation.
Jelmoli, the retail group, added SFr20 to SFr910 for a two day rise of 7.9
per cent. The shares have found favour after Wednesday's GDP figures
indicated a pick-up in domestic consumption.
PARIS ended modestly firmer, with the CAC-40 index picking up 6.47 to
2,160.45, after a day's high of 2,170.49 and a low of 2,146.92. Turnover was
estimated at some FFr4bn.
Carrefour shot ahead FFr32 to FFr3,882 on news that it had sold its 30 per
cent stake in But, a furniture retailer, under terms worth about FFr536m.
Canal Plus took an opposite direction, shedding FFr46 to FFr1,250, on news
that a decision on its licence renewal had been put back: a decision was
expected to have been made early next week.
Further disappointing car sales news knocked FFr6 off Peugeot's shares,
closing at FFr715.
AMSTERDAM added 0.1 in the CBS Tendency index to close at 138.3. Better than
expected results from ING helped the insurer gain 50 cents to Fl 85.90,
while elsewhere in the sector Aegon lost Fl 1.60 to Fl 101.20. ABN Amro
added 50 cents to Fl 71.00.
MILAN was higher, the Comit index adding 4.28 to 548.94, with volume
inflated by Fiat switching its savings and privileged shares to a wholly
owned subsidiary. The savings stock rose L22 to L2,020 in volume of 43m
shares while the ordinary shares were L37 higher at L3,953.
Credito Italiano advanced L18 to L2,319: the privatisation price is
scheduled to be announced tomorrow ahead of the start of the sale next week.
MADRID saw further solid gains before some late sell orders took prices off
their best levels. The general index aded 2.27 to 300.81 in heavy turnover
of Pta32.5bn.
Banks continued their recovery with BBV Pta100 higher at Pta3,200 and
Santander Pta190 ahead at Pta6,580. Among electricals, Iberdrola put on
Pta14 to Pta950 in volume of 3.7m.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Bundesbank leads way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank set off a round of minor interest rate cuts around Europe
yesterday by setting its repurchase rate at 6 per cent for the next five
weeks, writes Rachel Johnson.
It cut the repo rate by 25 basis points after its regular fortnightly
council meeting but left its two main rates, the Lombard and the discount,
unchanged at 6.75 per cent and 5.75 per cent respectively.
Central bank officials indicated this could be the first time that the
Bundesbank has announced ahead of time it would offer fixed interest rate
repos to the market for such a long period.
The move was acclaimed by economists as cleverly defusing pressure from
other countries - France in particular - to cut rates. For it sent enough of
a trigger to the markets to allow the authorities to shave rates even though
the Germans had left their main rates unchanged. As the bank tends to leave
a differential of around 30 to 40 basis points between the discount and repo
rates, yesterday's cut narrows this gap to only 25 basis points, making a
reduction in the discount rate more likely than a further cut in the repo
rate.
Although France had not moved its own rates in response yesterday, this was
largely because its next tender was not until Monday. Economists generally
expected the high yielders such as Italy and Spain to be the last to move.
Miss Alison Cottrell, currency analyst at Midland Global Markets, the
securities house, greeted the bank's operations as 'psychologically
beneficial for all sides'.
'This move will allow other 'core' Europeans to ease their own market - and
in some cases - interest rates,' she said.
The Dutch central bank cut its official interest rates by 25 basis points
and its special advances rate by 20 basis points, citing falling interest
rates and the strength of the guilder.
The Belgian central bank said it had cut all of its leading interest rates
in line with rate cuts in other European countries. It lowered the central
rate to 8 per cent from 8.30 per cent, the discount rate to 5 1/4 per cent
from 5 1/2 per cent and the emergency lending rate to 11 1/2 per cent from
12 per cent.
Market reaction to the moves centred on speculation as to whether the
Bundesbank would be more or less likely to cut rates on December 16, its
next council meeting. Miss Cottrell believes that if the M3 number shows
ample slowdown in the growth of broad money, this will encourage the bank to
take the bull by the horns on December 16.
After all, she pointed out, if the fundamentals had not supported a rate cut
the authorities would not have acted today. The bank risked a 'speculative
hell' on January 6 when normal meetings resumed unless it did something
earlier, she said.
The only risk to this plan, however, is on the large scale. If the world
trade talks collapse or fail to conclude successfully by the December 15
deadline, then currencies would be dancing to a very different tune than
they are now.
The talks have reached a delicate stage. The major players are both
stressing the need for one more heave and taking criticism from their
counterparts for holding up progress and refusing to compromise.
In Bonn, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr Francois Mitterrand,
the French president, said they were taking great pains to achieve a world
trade deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by the deadline.
Currencies had a quiet day in spite of the moves. There was a lull between
the UK Budget on Tuesday and today's US non-farm payroll figures for
December, on which the dollar's strength is expected to hinge. Mr Jim
O'Neill, chief currency strategist at Swiss Bank Corporation, said it was a
classic December week. 'Virtually all the data have been supportive of the
dollar, but the currency has not done much more than creep higher over the
last 48 hours,' he said.
The big tussle on the currency markets was one of 'domination' between the
Swiss franc - which has benefited from strong evidence of the Swiss
emergence from deep recession - and the dollar. The Swiss franc ended a
touch firmer against the D-Mark. In London the dollar rose to DM1.7215,
after a previous close of DM1.7175, and ended a little higher against the
Swiss franc at SFr1.4965, after a previous SFr1.4960. In New York the dollar
finished at DM1.7225.
For after a short burst of strength following the European rate cuts, the
dollar fell back to wait for the employment data. The market is expecting a
jump of about 177,000 in the non-farm payrolls in November to add to
mounting evidence of a broad-based consumer-led recovery.
A sharp increase in US consumer spending in October was consistent with a
double-digit increase in consumer confidence last month, and there are
rising hopes for a 4 per cent to 5 per cent GDP number for the fourth
quarter.
On the London money market, the Bank of England predicted a sizeable
shortage of Pounds 2.65bn, which it relieved almost fully during the day's
operations with total help of Pounds 2.52bn.
The escudo is unlikely to react to yesterday's government reshuffle, in
which Mr Eduardo Catroga replaced Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo as finance
minister. Dealers are attributing the stronger escudo to slack end-of-year
activity in the foreign exchange market.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (11): Powerful competitive
position - Profile / Yamazaki Mazak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's big machine tool producers - Yamazaki Mazak, Amada, Toyoda, Okuma,
Hitachi Seiki - are rightly seen by European and US rivals as formidable
worldwide competitors, but not even they have remained immune from the
industry's global recession.
The Japanese industry is the largest in the world, accounting for about a
quarter of total machine tool production worth Dollars 34.6bn last year,
according to statistics from American Machinist. But consumption of machine
tools in Japan, which was also the world's largest market, fell 32 per cent
to Dollars 5.7bn last year, says the magazine.
Last month, the Japan Machine Tool Builders Association said orders received
by the Japanese producers this year were likely to fall short of Y600bn for
the first time since 1983. Total orders last year were Y710.2bn, down 37 per
cent from 1991 and only just over half the Y1,412.1bn achieved in the boom
year of 1990.
And the recession is still continuing - machine tool orders in September
were down 31.5 per cent from a year earlier at Y42.3bn due to weak private
sector demand amid continued economic stagnation, the association said.
Mr Teruyuki Yamazaki, chairman and president of privately-held Yamazaki
Mazak, points out that in some respects, Japanese producers are suffering in
the same way as their German counterparts.
'For the machine tool industry in Europe, volumes are about 50 per cent
down, compared with the peak time (two to three years ago),' he says. 'Japan
has seen about the same fall.'
Up to a point, there are similarities in the longer-term structural changes
going on in both the German and Japanese domestic markets for machine tools.
In Japan, one of the reasons for the rapid fall in demand for machine tools
has been the excess capacity in the automotive and other industries built in
the expectation that growth rates in domestic sales and exports would
continue.
As in Germany, the high costs of domestic manufacturing are encouraging the
machine tool industry's customers to move manufacturing, or at least the
supply of components, overseas. Investments by the Japanese automotive
industry in the US and the UK represent machine tool orders that might once
have been domestic business but are now either export orders or supplied by
Japanese or rival machine tool builders manufacturing elsewhere.
It is in the export business that Mr Yamazaki sees further similarities
between the Japanese industry's predicament and that of the German industry.
'Japanese exporters are facing heavy competition in the European market
because the yen is too strong,' he says.
This is a disadvantage for Yamazaki in respect of the machines it exports
from Japan, but Mr Yamazaki notes that German producers are facing similar
problems exporting to countries with weak currencies.
Some might argue that the key difference between the two leading machine
tool producing countries is that the Japanese have a much tighter grip on
their home market where imports accounted for 10 per cent of consumption
last year, compared with 36 per cent in Germany.
But while many believe that the present recession has seriously weakened the
European machine tool industry's competitiveness vis-a-vis its Japanese
rivals, Mr Yamazaki does not believe this is the case. 'In Germany the
machine tool industry has suffered, and so have we, so the competitive
balance has not changed much.'
In spite of the global recession, the strong yen, and the more fundamental
changes in the Japanese market, though, Yamazaki Mazak is in a powerful
position competitively, when compared not only with non-Japanese producers
but also with domestic rivals.
With overseas manufacturing at Florence in Kentucky, Worcester in the UK,
Les Ulis in France, and Singapore its production base is more international
than is the case generally in the machine tool industry.
The Worcester plant began producing machine tools in 1987 and was intended
mainly as a manufacturing base for Europe. It was then considered that the
investment would foreshadow many more by Japanese producers in Europe - 'We
were a step ahead,' says Mr Yamazaki.
That this has not happened is due partly to recent market conditions. But Mr
Yamazaki believes it has also been much more difficult for the Japanese
producers to invest in one European country than in the US, because of the
many different cultures, markets, languages and tax systems in Europe. 'Some
of the Japanese wanted to invest in Europe, but they could not do it,' he
says.
The Worcester plant, along with other UK-based machine tool producers, has
seen its home market hit by the recession - first in the UK and then in
continental Europe. But lower costs and the recent devaluation of sterling
mean that, according to Mr Yamazaki, 'we have good competitiveness from our
UK machines.'
The company is now expanding exports from the Worcester plant to markets
outside Europe, and is also gradually increasing the number of machine tool
types made there.
No one in the machine tool industry is predicting a return to the heady days
of 1990, when sales were being buoyed by factors such as the 'bubble
economy' in Japan. But Mr Yamazaki is confident about the long-term need for
machine tools, especially in Europe and the US. 'If you look at European and
US customers of the machine tool industry,' he says, 'you will see that many
of their production facilities are older than those used in Japan. So these
customers will have to make more investment in equipment.'
He is also keeping a close eye on Asia, where cheap labour and booming
markets have encouraged many traditional Yamazaki customers to begin
manufacturing. Machine tool producers such as Yamazaki are following their
customers into Asia, but also want to be there to take advantage of the
region's overall market opportunities.
The company began producing machine tool parts in Singapore last year, and
also has a technical co-operation agreement with a Chinese machine tool
builder, Shenyang No 1 Machine Tool Works. This is not yet a joint venture,
but Mr Yamazaki says the co-operation has good potential for further
development.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (12): Fresh approach to
automation - Construction Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS NORMILE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's general contractors have earned a lot of recognition in recent years
with the development of construction site robots. These mechanical wonders
can roam construction sites spraying fireproofing and finishing concrete
floors. There is only one problem.
'They have not proven very cost effective,' says Mr Yasuo Fujinami, deputy
general manager for technology at Taisei Corporation.
Undaunted by a false start, the industry is taking a new approach to
mechanising construction sites. Rather than automate individual tasks, the
focus is now on systems that attempt to turn construction sites into
factories for the assembly of prefabricated components. Rather than showcase
the latest in robots, the systems are designed to optimise the mix of
computer control, automation, mechanical innovations and plain old manual
labour.
Shimizu's Smart System, for example, is now in use for the first time on a
20-story, 20,665 sq m office building in Nagoya. After completing the
foundations, what will become the top floor and roof of the building were
erected on top of four jacking towers. Suspended from this structure is a
network of rail cranes and trolley hoists that can deliver a load to any
point on the floor below. The hoists also travel on a vertical lift erected
alongside the building to bring material from ground level.
A computer housed on the top floor controls all these hoists and cranes and
can place steel beams and columns, precast floor sections, wall panels and
other building components following programmed instructions. As the building
is erected, the four jacking towers push up the top floor and then lift
their own bases from floor to floor.
Rather than rely on sensors for precise positioning, joints have ingeniously
detailed slots and plates that mechanically guide beams and columns into
final position. Once in place, clamps on the hoist cables release
automatically. This all means that once a human rigger attaches the cables
to a steel member at ground level, the system can erect it without further
human help. In actual practice, however, a control room operator using video
monitors and a spotter on the working level watch the hoists as they
position their loads.
The closest thing to an actual robot is a welding machine, but even this is
not fully automated. An operator must set it in place and start it manually.
But then it uses sensors and programmed instructions to make the correct
weld. Shimizu figures that one operator can tend two machines.
Yasuyoshi Miyatake, who led the development of the system for Shimizu, says
the system allowed them to cut their erection crew from 20 to 13. With
additional labour savings from prefabrication, they figure a 30 per cent
reduction in the man hours needed to complete the building. 'Eventually, we
think we can make that 50 per cent,' Mr Miyatake says.
Virtually all of Japan's leading contractors have their own systems, either
in their first use or under development. They all follow the same theme but
have individual variations. In Taisei's T-Up system, the staging platform
surrounds and hangs from the steel for the central core of the building. Two
cranes on top of the platform erect the core steel while two cranes
suspended beneath the platform erect the surrounding steel. Taisei figures
running four cranes simultaneously will allow them to cut the construction
period of a 33-story 111,000 sq m office tower it is building in Yokohama
from 30 to 24 months.
The increased productivity and shorter construction periods have not shown
up on the bottom line. Shimizu and Taisei both say use of the systems did
not result in lower contract prices for owners. For one thing they have to
recover their development costs. Shimizu figures the hardware alone,
developed in co-operation with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, cost Y1,000m.
More importantly, the focus of the industry's automation efforts is not
reducing costs but cutting labour requirements. Although less of a crisis
with the current recession, the industry still faces a labour shortage, with
young workers, especially, avoiding the construction trades.
The industry first attempted to counter this by automating hard or dangerous
tasks. Mr Yukio Hasegawa, who heads a construction robot research programme
at Waseda University, says the industry was naive, dreaming up robots far
more sophisticated than anything developed for manufacturing. He says
contractors and equipment makers have developed more than 100 types of
construction robots. 'But very few of them are actually used,' he says. They
have proven difficult to adapt to the variety of conditions on construction
sites.
A similar challenge faces the new systems. So far, the systems have only
been applied to buildings that are tall and relatively square in plan. To be
practical, the gains from the increased productivity and speed have to
offset the time and effort required to set the systems in place.
Mr Takanobu Kumano, a manager in Taisei's technology division, says the
lower limit for their system is probably about 30 stories. This means that
out of the hundreds of buildings the company takes on each year, there are
only seven or eight that could use their system.
Despite present limitations, Roozbeh Kangari, associate professor of civil
engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, believes the industry is now
taking the right approach: looking at the overall process to see where
mechanisation makes sense and where it doesn't. Mr Kangari spent a year in
Japan studying Shimizu's mechanisation efforts.
Mr Takayoshi Sato, a general manager for Tokyo-based Futaba Quantity
Surveying, says that rather than concentrating high-tech systems on a few
projects, greater gains could come from spreading the use of standardised
and prefabricated components throughout the industry. Mr Sato says the
widespread use of such components in the US and Europe makes site labour
there more productive, despite generally higher wage rates.
The contractors recognise the need to extend the systems to a wider range of
buildings. Shimizu's Mr Miyatake says their next challenge is to apply the
concept to low-rise offices. And in typical Japanese fashion, they are
already improving system performance. After erecting a couple of floors of
steel, they modified the control software, cutting from 400 seconds to 200
seconds the time it takes for a hoist to traverse the rail crane network.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (9): Consumers forced back to
basics - Retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Yukio Higuchi set up his first discount liquor store in Tokyo 25
years ago, he had to endure numerous anonymous death threats. He spent most
of his time fending off the thugs loitering around his store while trying to
convince wholesalers to sell him goods.
Years later, however, supported by a change in consumer attitudes and a
prolonged economic downturn, his Kawachiya liquor chain is thriving. 'During
the weekends, the stores get so crowded I have to close the shutters to keep
people out,' he says.
During the 'bubble' economy of the late 1980s, ordinary Japanese did not
think twice about spending on highly-priced household goods, food and drink.
However the sharp fall in corporate profits and the consequent
restructurings have posed a threat to workers' real income, forcing
consumers to go back to basics.
Boxes of beers and bottles of whisky at a 30 per cent discount to the normal
retail price have an obvious attraction.
Kawachiya, which is unlisted, says its sales have grown by about 30 per cent
for the past three years, and it expects annual sales to double this year to
Y15bn due to the launch of new stores. The trend towards cheaper prices,
however, does not stop at liquor. Consumers are turning to discount stores
for their electronic goods, clothes, drugs and other everyday products.
Aoyama Trading, a manufacturer and retailer of office workers' blue suits,
has seen profits surge during the past few years. For the first six months
to September, the company posted a 34.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Y12.1bn on a 38.7 per cent increase in sales to Y76.6bn.
To achieve these results, discount retailers are turning away from
conventional methods of Japanese retailing, relying on the myriad of
wholesalers for supplies and providing extensive service.
Japanese manufacturers set retail prices with profit margins high enough to
support two levels of wholesalers and the retailer. In addition, domestic
manufacturers cushion their retailers by offering rebates.
Until now those who tried to buck the system faced intimidation by retail
associations, manufacturers and wholesalers. For retailers such as
Kawachiya, securing a procurement route for merchandise has also been
difficult.
By selling its products at a discount, Kawachiya is foregoing a bulk of the
revenue that ordinary retailers see, but it manages to keep down costs by
its no-frills approach. Most of the employees are hired part time, the
merchandise is kept in boxes and its stores resemble old shacks. 'Consumers
shouldn't have to pay extra to support distributors,' he says. In the case
of Aoyama, and other men's suit discounters, they have turned to cheap
production costs in south-east Asia and China, buying products directly from
the manufacturers.
In sharp contrast to the discount stores, Japan's upmarket department stores
have been suffering from the plunge in consumer spending. October sales at
leading department stores in the greater Tokyo area fell 10.4 per cent to
Y209.5bn, the 20th consecutive decline. At the same time, Mitsukoshi, the
prestigious department store which has business ties with Harrods, announced
its first interim pre-tax loss in nine years.
Mr Paul Heaton, retail analyst at Baring Securities in Tokyo, explains:
'Department stores have the most to lose from the rising popularity of
discount retailers.'
Meanwhile, discount retailers have received a boost from stricter
enforcement against price control by the country's Fair Trade Commission
(FTC), the anti-monopoly watchdog.
Japanese manufacturers and wholesalers have often threatened to stop
shipments if the retailer failed to apply the 'suggested retail price' set
by the manufacturer. But manufacturers are now being forced to allow
retailers to set their own prices.
Japanese beer companies announced in 1990 that retailers were free to set
their own prices. Earlier this year, sales of subsidiaries of leading
electronics companies, including Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony,
were warned about attempts to prevent retailers from discounting their
products by threatening to withdraw contracts.
Mr Higuchi at Kawachiya says he has been actively informing the FTC of any
unfair practice from manufacturers. Last year he took a pharmaceutical
company, which cut shipments after Kawachiya started discounting its pep
drink, to the commission.
In August, he lodged a complaint against leading cosmetics companies,
including Shiseido. He claims Shiseido and other producers cancelled or
decreased shipments after he had rejected pleas to stop discounting luxury
cosmetic brands.
Japan's cosmetic makers distribute merchandise through small chain stores
and have asserted pressure while providing large rebates at the same time,
to prevent retailers from discounting. Following an investigation by the
FTC, Shiseido recently announced that it would review its contracts and
rebate practices with its chain store operators.
Analysts predict that changes in consumer spending patterns are here to
stay, and even if the economy picks up, sales of high-priced merchandise at
department stores will not recover. This may be the reason why the
department stores are starting to sell cheaper products. To compete with the
likes of Aoyama, one leading department store recently attracted customers
by offering men's silk suits below Y30,000.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (10): Spectre of the rusting
town - Steel Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Kamaishi, on the northern coast of Japan, steelmakers can see the future
they fear. The town, site of the country's first blast furnace for pig iron,
began rusting two decades ago when Nippon Steel announced a restructuring
that meant job losses and a gradual reduction in steel output.
The Japanese government predicts that Kamaishi's population will be halved
from the present 50,820 by the year 2010, and Kamaishi Shinkin Bank, the
local bank, collapsed earlier this year under bad loans equivalent to about
60 per cent of its total loans outstanding.
Steelworkers in the town have turned to mushroom growing and the building
materials industry, but they are struggling against the general downturn in
the economy. The same is true for the Nippon Steel Kamaishi rugby team, the
country's strongest side during the 1970s, which has slowly slipped down the
national ladder.
Japan's steelmakers are concerned that they and the communities which depend
on the industry for survival are facing not just recession, but a
Kamaishi-like decline.
Mr Takashi Imai, Nippon Steel's president, said his company would have to
change the structure of its management and workforce to ward off the rust.
He suggests that Japan faces an unemployment problem similar to that of the
US, where jobs lost in manufacturing where not soaked up by the service
sector. In the case of steelmakers, he says, traditional customers such as
automotive and consumer electronics companies are selling to a mature
domestic market after four decades of expansion.
'We are looking for some other industries that will replace these industries
as a source of demand, but we haven't been able to find them,' Mr Imai said.
Steel companies can see their own diversification policies reflected in the
Kamaishi government's unsuccessful attempts to create new industries. There
was a plan for a marine theme park, and former steel workers now make office
furniture, but the town is still losing younger workers to neighbouring
regions and the main shopping centre is dotted with permanently shuttered
shops.
The Japanese steel industry was inspired to diversify after the Plaza Accord
in 1985 led to a rapid appreciation of the yen and a slowing of domestic
demand. Steel production fell from 105m tonnes in 1985 to 98m tonnes a year
later, and the leading makers slipped into the red during 1987.
Companies began to cut their workforces and expand into new business areas,
in particular, computers and semiconductors, which were seen as the
'industrial rice' of the future. The shift was thought appropriate because
steel companies have traditionally seen themselves as the suppliers of
Japan's industrial staple.
But the speculative excess of the late 1980s led the steel industry off
course. The workforce cuts slowed when domestic demand for steel bounced
back to 105.6m tonnes in 1988, and the country became more concerned about a
longer-term labour shortage than a short-term surplus of workers.
The cheap capital of that era, when money was easily raised through new
issues of equity or equity-linked bonds, fuelled the industry's many
diversifications, some of which were unwise. Sales projections were
calculated when stock prices were climbing relentlessly and the Japanese
economy was expanding at annual rate of 7 per cent.
Steel companies are feeling the cost of those miscalculations. In the first
half to September, the five leading makers had pre-tax losses, including
Y16.7bn at Nippon Steel and Y15.4bn at NKK, which both reported profits last
year. The losses would have been more embarrassing if the companies had not
reaped profits from the sale of equities.
For the full year to March, the leading five companies, which tend to move
as a caravan in and out of loss, are expecting combined losses of about
Y60bn, although Japanese steel industry specialists say the figure would be
Y200bn, if the benefits of accounting changes and profits on securities
sales were not counted.
The pressures to discard loss-making diversification projects are obvious,
but the companies are still determined to restructure without dismissing
workers. Sumitomo Metal Industries, which had an interim loss of Y9bn, said
the change in market conditions had forced a broad review.
'As for the electronics, new materials and biomedical divisions, efforts
shall be concentrated on examining profitability in each field and in
identifying where profits can be improved as quickly as possible,' Sumitomo
said.
Each of the companies concede that demand will remain weak into next year,
with some growth expected in public works construction which has been
undermined in recent months by political scandals. Local governments have
delayed project awards, fearing that the successful company may be
implicated in the scandal, but they will eventually have to make a decision.
Steel companies are also hoping that demand from China will strengthen in
coming months. Kobe Steel noted in its summary of the first half, when it
lost Y8.1bn, that exports to China early in the year had 'increased
remarkably'.
Japanese steelmakers have co-operatively shared the profits of China demand,
just as they collectively negotiate prices for imported materials.
But the present downturn has raised the question of whether the
'restructuring' described by Mr Imai will also mean an end to the very cosy
relationship among the leading five companies.
Nippon Steel has been criticised in the past for not exploiting the
advantages of its size and expertise, and being as concerned to represent
the industry's interests as much as its own.
The next year will be a test of the company's will, and a measure of the
relative importance of its shareholders and its industry friendships.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (7): GM deal highlights
challenges - The Car Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late last month, GM and Toyota, the world's largest and second-largest
carmakers, signed a deal that highlights some of the big challenges facing
the Japanese car industry.
The agreement calls for Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, to sell 20,000 GM
cars a year in Japan under the Toyota nameplate.
While the volume of GM cars Toyota has agreed to sell in Japan is miniscule,
compared with the hundreds of thousands of cars Toyota sells in the US, it
represents a significant victory for GM in opening up the Japanese car
market to US competition.
The US carmaker not only won agreement from Toyota to open up its
distribution network to sell a competitor's car, it even managed to set a
target for average annual sales.
Whether they like it or not, Japanese carmakers are going to face greater
competition than ever before from the US Big Three carmakers in their own
market. And if the recent deal between Toyota and GM is any guide, the
competition is likely to be dictated to a growing extent by political
pressures that are not directly related to market competitiveness.
While GM and Toyota were negotiating their latest deal, US and Japanese
government officials were bickering over a possible agreement to prise open
the Japanese car and car parts market to greater foreign penetration.
One of the most contentious issue in these talks has been the US insistence
on setting quantitative indicators which would show progress in opening up
the Japanese markets for cars and car parts.
Although the Japanese government has refused to agree to such targets in
what it calls the interests of free trade, the agreement between GM and
Toyota leaves an uneasy feeling that the US side has won a small but
significant concession to its aims even though there has been no apparent
official prodding of a deal between the two companies.
The threat of US carmakers to the Japanese in their own market is by no
means critical. But the timing of their onslaught could not have been worse.
For the past few years, Japan's car industry has been suffering under the
impact of a consumer reaction to the high-spending years of the late 1980s.
During those years consumers went on a buying binge that led to
overoptimistic assumptions in the industry about demand for cars and the
necessary levels of production capacity.
Those assumptions in turn led to over-investment in facilities, a
proliferation of models and options and bloated corporate structures.
Nissan, for example, invested heavily in automation while Mazda built up an
ambitious five-channel distribution strategy.
As the domestic slump has persisted, it has become apparent that the
expansion in domestic demand on which they had based their future
strategies, is no longer there.
The situation has forced Japanese carmakers to scale back their ambitions,
cutting deeply into capital expenditure and other costs and trimming their
corporate structures.
A moderate consolidation has been taking place as the increasingly crowded
Japanese market for passenger cars has begun to put pressure on the weaker
players. Isuzu, for example, has decided to pull out of car manufacture and
rely on other makers to fill its product line-up. Companies such as Mazda
and Honda have conceded that they can no longer expect to do everything
themselves and, like Isuzu, are resorting to original equipment manufacture
deals, to provide them with products they cannot justify developing on their
own.
Meanwhile, the domestic market has continued its relentless slide, leading
many carmakers to announce a downward revision of production plans. Nissan
recently decided to extend the temporary closure of facilities for two more
days in order to cut back on production as well as costs. Mazda has decided
to introduce a temporary closure period that will affect production levels
of all its models.
When they announced worsening business results for the half-year period to
September last month, the carmakers remained cautious about the prospects
for recovery in the near term.
Against this background of gloomy prospects at home, pressure on their
overseas operations has been just as damaging. The yen's sharp appreciation
against other leading currencies this year has undermined profits in
overseas markets as well as reducing their competitiveness against local
manufacturers.
The plunge in demand for cars in Europe's main markets has upset their plans
for expansion in that market. Nissan has had to advertise for applicants for
a voluntary retirement scheme at its UK plant as market conditions in Europe
have failed to improve.
In the US, where the economic recovery has helped business improve somewhat,
Japanese carmakers face growing competition from their US rivals which have
begun to close the gap with them in manufacturing quality.
These changes which have created a business environment that is markedly
different from the high growth days which Japanese carmakers had long grown
accustomed to are forcing these companies to re-think their corporate
strategies.
In the past, the aim of most Japanese carmakers was quite clearly to
increase market share in key markets, and use that growth as the basis for
the company's own expansion.
Once it has become difficult to expect growth in worldwide markets,
companies have gradually been shifting the emphasis to improving
profitability. They have been doing so not only through efforts to raise
efficiency in both product development and manufacturing, but also through a
company-wide review of the performance of white collar workers.
Toyota, Nissan and Honda have all introduced programmes aimed at getting
better value out of their office workers. While Toyota aims to raise white
collar efficiency by about 30 per cent, Nissan and Honda have introduced
performance-related pay schemes.
Whether or not these initiatives pay off has yet to be seen. What is clear,
however, is that the singleness of purpose - growth at all costs - that
served Japanese carmakers so well in the past, is looking increasingly
inappropriate in the changed market environment.
For Japanese carmakers, the US Big Three to which they provided their own
manufacturing know-how not so long ago, may not seem likely role models in
shaping their future corporate strategies. But given the recently improved
performance of the US carmakers, Toyota may yet have something to learn in
its part as GM salesman.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (6): Strong yen's winners and
losers - Corporate Earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until now, many ordinary Japanese have taken pride in the rising value of
the yen as a sign of national strength, even though it could only be
appreciated when they travelled abroad, buying cheaper handbags in Paris and
extra cans of Fortnum and Mason tea in London.
However, this perception has shifted drastically as the sharp rise in the
yen this year has eroded corporate profits and accelerated an exodus of
manufacturing from Japan, raising fears of job security and declines in
workers' real income.
After fluctuating around the Y125 to the dollar level during January this
year, the yen rose to Y105 in June, and has remained around that level ever
since. The Japanese manufacturing sector's high reliance on exports is
damaging the economy, due to lower sales and profits from the sharp rise in
the yen. Benefits from the stronger yen have been small because of low
import levels - and sluggish demand.
According to Nomura Research Institute, research arm of Nomura Securities,
the higher yen caused losses of Y45.2bn and profits of Y3.3bn during the
first quarter of 1993, while the second quarter saw losses of Y925.3bn and
profits of Y350.8bn.
NRI estimates that if the yen rate remains at about Y105 to the dollar in
the second half of 1993, annual exchange losses incurred by exporters would
total about Y4,000bn, while importers are expected to make about Y3,000bn in
exchange gains for the full year, generating a net loss of Y1,000bn.
Earnings by export-oriented industries, especially electronics, cars,
textiles and shipping, have been hit. Beneficiaries of the higher yen have
been limited to power utility companies and some oil refiners, which rely on
fuel imports. Foods and paper and pulp companies also import materials, but
lower demand due to the prolonged economic slump have overshadowed the
gains.
Although the export ratio of consumer electronics companies has fallen
sharply during the past six to seven years, the ratio remains high,
averaging 41.5 per cent last year. Companies in this sector which centre
business on audio visual-related machines generated 60.1 per cent of their
sales overseas. A Y1 rise against the dollar is said to cause losses of Y5bn
at Sony and Y2bn at Matsushita Electric Industrial.
Sony which posts 65 per cent of its sales overseas, suffered a 53 per cent
fall in parent pre-tax profits for the first half to September. Overall
sales fell 11 per cent to Y852.6bn as the yen's rise cost the company Y74bn
in sales.
The export ratio of six leading carmakers average around 51 per cent.
According to Wako Research Institute, a rise of Y1 against the dollar would
cause a 10.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. Nissan Motor, which posted
pre-tax losses for the first half, has warned that it will not make a profit
for the full year to March. During the first half, the impact of the yen's
rise amounted to Y100bn. Some Y50bn was absorbed through forward exchange
dealing and price rises, and the net impact on sales totalled Y50bn.
The high yen led to the 'Finland shock' in the shipbuilding industry earlier
this year, when Kvaerner Masa of Finland captured an order from Abu Dhabi to
supply tankers. The high yen is eroding the competitiveness of Japanese
shipbuilders and a fall in prices based in dollars, due to increased
competition, has led to sharp declines in yen-based profit margins.
According to brokers James Capel in Tokyo, during the six months to
September, gross tonnage of approved new buildings increased by 6.5 per
cent, but the total value of the orders declined by 18.9 per cent.
The high yen has cut into exports of the textile and chemicals sector while
leading to increased import penetration. Inventories of polyester filament
at textile makers have risen due to the increase in cheaper imports from
south-east Asia and the fall in exports.
In the chemicals industry, net exports of resins were down by 31 per cent
during the first six months of this year. On the other hand, Japan imported
3.8 times as much high-density polyethylene, accounting for almost 4 per
cent of domestic demand, up 3 percentage points.
Meanwhile the higher yen lowered imported fuel and material costs for
several industries. The gas companies saw a jump in interim profits thanks
to a fall in fuel costs and a rise in demand for gas due to an unusually
cold summer. However, gas and electric power companies have been ordered to
pass on profits from the higher yen, and are expected to pass a total of
Y265bn to the consumer this year by lowering rates.
Tokyo Gas saw interim pre-tax profits surge 211.2 per cent to Y14.4bn,
thanks to higher demand and lower costs. The company saw fuel costs fall 3.8
per cent to Y54.8bn on lower fuel prices and a higher yen. However, it
forecasts a 2 per cent fall in full-year pre-tax profits to Y35bn, due to
the lowering of gas rates.
Although the higher yen reduced costs at electric power companies, a fall in
demand amid the economic slump and the cold summer hurt profits. Tokyo
Electric Power posted a decline in interim sales and profits for the first
time in five years. Electricity rate cuts are expected to reduce the
company's income by Y36bn for the year to March next year.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (8): Eyes firmly set on the
future - Electronics and Telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past few years have been a period of corporate soul-searching for
Japan's electronics companies.
Not only has the country's economic slowdown brought some of the world's
largest and strongest electronic manufacturing companies a third year of
falling profits, but the changes in the business environment have also, in
many cases, derailed their plans for the future.
Consumer electronics makers have been weakened by a marked reversal in
consumer sentiment. The lack of consumer interest is hurting their ability
to promote the next generation of products they had been hoping would make
up for the saturation of markets for their traditional profit earners, such
as video tape recorders and CD players.
High definition TV sets, which many consumer electronics makers had hoped
would take off as prices came down, have been a commercial flop in the face
of a lack of programmes and a new-found penny-pinching trend among
consumers.
New electronic gizmos, such as MiniDiscs - the miniature, recordable discs
positioned as the latest-generation portable audio system - and digital
compact cassettes, have not been the blockbusters they would need to be to
make up for the fall in revenues from conventional audio-visual sales.
Mr Norio Ohga, president of Sony, points to strong demand for his company's
navigation systems - which at more than Y200,000 a piece are not exactly a
bargain - to illustrate the point that consumers are still buying products
they really want. However, as one company after another reports huge falls
in profits, it is difficult to shake off the perception that consumer
electronics makers have lost touch with their market.
In response to a question about the most crucial tasks facing Matsushita, Mr
Motoi Matsuda, a director and member of the board, conceded recently that
the company needed to go back to its roots of providing consumers with
products that they wanted.
'The fact that our profitability is falling is a sign that we are not
contributing enough to society,' Mr Matsuda said. 'We are losing our raison
d'etre.'
Meanwhile, Japan's computer makers are also facing a turning point.
After years of growing profits sustained by a protected domestic market,
Japanese PC makers are facing serious foreign competition in their home
territory for the first time.
The spread of a bilingual operating system called DOS-V that was developed
by IBM, and the arrival of Compaq and Dell on the scene, have shaken the
Japanese PC makers out of their cosy existence. This had allowed companies
to cling on to a captive audience and carve up the domestic market among
themselves by selling proprietary systems that were incompatible with each
other and with any other systems outside of Japan.
The introduction of low-cost machines into Japan by US PC makers last autumn
triggered a price war that damaged the profitability of high-cost Japanese
makers and shattered the myth in Japan that computers were by necessity
expensive products.
One year later, most Japanese PC makers have joined the IBM camp and
introduced IBM-compatible machines, opening the door to fundamental change
in the Japanese PC market.
As the consumer electronics and computer industries look to the future for
growth, they share a common problem - income from traditional profit earners
is on the downtrend.
At the same time, they have been hampered by a poor business environment in
Japan from charging forth into what is expected to be the most promising new
markets for the industries in future - portable communications and
multimedia.
Historical and cultural circumstance, as well as bureaucratic regulation,
have obstructed the development of conditions which are essential for the
growth of those two markets.
For example, the market for mobile communications is still relatively small
in Japan. Although Japan has the largest market after the US, with 1.7m
subscribers, penetration is low with only one per cent of Japanese using
mobile phones compared with 3 per cent in the UK.
The low penetration of mobile phones is attributed to circumstances such as
the spread of public pay phones and the acute lack of airwaves in urban
areas, as well as to obstructive regulatory moves by the authorities.
The high cost of subscribing to a mobile phone service, which is blamed for
the slow penetration in Japan, is in part a result of the need to apply to
the Post and Telecommunications Ministry for price reductions. So, while
competition in the industry is severe, 'prices do not fall according to
market forces,' says an official at DoCoMo, the mobile phones subsidiary of
NTT.
Handset manufacturers in the electronics and consumer electronics industries
have also been hampered - by the market's slow growth and by bureaucratic
meddling - in the development of their handset businesses.
So far, handsets have only been allowed to be sold by the operators which
buy their handsets from the manufacturers on an original equipment
manufacture basis and sell them under their own brand. Next spring, when the
sale of handsets is deregulated, competition among makers is expected to
reduce prices and spur subscription to services.
Personal handyphones are another market that is expected to grow in future.
But here again the regulatory grip of the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications could have unfortunate consequences for the growth of the
industry. The ministry is considering which companies to allow into the new
market and could end up hampering competition as it did in the mobile phones
market.
Meanwhile, in the area of multimedia, which is the convergence of computing
power and telecommunications to bring a greater amount of information to
more places more speedily, Japan lacks the advanced telecommunications
infrastructure which is a precondition for the successful application of
multimedia.
For one thing, cable TV, which is expected to be a big carrier of multimedia
services, such as video on demand and interactive TV, has not been very
successful in Japan. Again, circumstances such as the wide availability of
terrestrial programming in Japan and bureaucratic regulation are blamed for
the slow growth of cable TV.
Japanese company executives also confess to a lack of ideas about how the
new technologies could be used by consumers. While US companies dream up
information super-highways and 100-channel programming, Japanese electronics
makers wonder out loud what use all the extra communications ability might
serve. 'It is still not clear what multimedia is,' says Mr Tsuzo Murase,
executive vice-president of Matsushita.
What is clear, nevertheless, is that if and when the golden age of mobile
communications and multimedia do come, Japanese electronics companies have
their eyes firmly set on providing the hardware and key technologies that
will be crucial to make those services a practical reality.
To that end they are pumping their resources into key technologies such as
liquid crystal displays, long-lasting batteries and advanced memory chips,
which will play a growing part in portable communications and, eventually,
multimedia as well.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (5): Intense backroom battle -
Deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newcomers to Japan sometimes find it hard to understand why the country has
such efficient manufacturing industries and yet such a primitive service
sector.
This is precisely the problem that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime
minister, is seeking to tackle with his potentially wide-ranging programme
to scrap or review more than 10,000 regulations that control an estimated 40
per cent of Japanese industry.
If Mr Hosokawa has his way, he will remove many of the unnecessary costs of
complying with bureaucratic rules that provide such a drag on Japanese
competitiveness, as exposed by the yen's steep rise. The upshot could be to
improve Japanese industry's growth potential at a time when important
international car and consumer electronics markets are becoming mature.
Foreign companies also have a stake in this. If successful, Mr Hosokawa's
deregulation drive could ease the way for imports, by streamlining complex
certification procedures and removing a layer or two of the Byzantine
distribution system that drives up costs to the benefits of hordes of middle
men.
Estimates of the general economic impact vary widely. At the conservative
end, the Japan Research Institute, a private body, believes the programme
could unleash a Y44,800bn rise in gross consumption, of which Y32,900bn
would be increased imports and the remaining Y11,900bn would be supplied by
domestic industry. At the optimistic end, one US economics expert believes
that demand could rise by Y80,000bn, as a result.
But first, the new government has to overcome fierce entrenched opposition,
which has ensured that previous attempts at cutting red tape by earlier
governments have got nowhere. Traditionally protected industries such as
distribution, rice and construction fear losing their privileges. Japan's
powerful civil service, unsurprisingly, resents this attempt to reduce its
bureaucratic influence.
That is why the deregulation drive has run into an intense backroom battle,
as a result of which the first achievements are likely to be slight.
Perhaps it is just as well that initial progress will be slow, for US and
European Union experience during the 1980s shows that deregulation tends to
produce a short-term rise in unemployment, as inefficient businesses go
bankrupt, before the reduction in costs works through to the economy at
large. The last thing that Japan's economy needs in the middle of a
recession is a dose of deflation, points out Mr Tom Hill, strategist at SG
Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
Yet it is surprising that any progress has been possible, given the
difficulty of obtaining agreement on anything in a seven-party coalition.
Just after taking office in early August, Mr Hosokawa asked government
ministries to come up with a list of rules for the scrap heap. At the same
time, he established a panel of 15 business leaders, economists and former
officials, under Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren business
federation, to consider broader economic reforms centred on how to stimulate
domestic demand.
A month later, the ministries produced 60 proposals, most of which had
already been gathering dust for years or were likely to have little impact.
They included an easing of restrictions on the freight weight of trucks, an
end to minimum production limits for brewers - which keep potential small
producers out of the market - and fewer car roadworthiness inspections. The
package also proposed a relaxation in regulations on new retail stores,
although the details are vague.
Undeterred, Mr Hosokawa sent the ministries back to the drawing board, after
which they produced 34 more proposals, announced in mid-September at the
same time as a Y6,150bn economic pump-priming package.
The most radical new measure in the second round was to publish monthly
lists of import cost prices for basic consumer goods, to exert moral
pressure on high-priced retailers to trim profit margins and pass down some
of the benefits of the yen's strength to customers.
The next stage, generally greeted as a disappointment, was last month's
publication of the interim report of Mr Hiraiwa's panel.
The report, already once rewritten after Mr Hosokawa rejected a first draft
as too vague, says there should be 'no sanctuaries' from deregulation. It
singles out as urgent examples for review 500 rules, including the rice
import ban and the resale price system, which requires some products to be
sold at producers' recommended prices.
It also calls for the establishment next April of a central body, under the
prime minister's direct control, to carry out a five-year deregulation plan.
Mr Hiraiwa promises more concrete proposals in his final report, due on
December 15. That will provide the most revealing indicator to date of
whether or not the new government will do any better than previous ones at
overcoming bureaucratic attempts to block deregulation.
The signs are, however, that this will get further than previous attempts at
cutting red tape, such as the 1986 Maekawa report, named after its author, a
former governor of the Bank of Japan. That proposed a shift away from
export-led growth, the traditional engine of Japan's post-war economy, to
domestic growth, fuelled by consumer demand. None of its proposals were
acted on and it is the Hiraiwa panel's job to turn the Maekawa principles
into concrete proposals for action.
Mr Hosokawa has in his favour support from the top business lobbies, which
see deregulation as an important way to reduce costs - on distribution, for
example - and to help reduce the yen's value and assuage trade tension.
Indeed, the Keidanren has criticised Mr Hosokawa for not going far enough
and has persuaded the government to adopt some of its own deregulation
ideas.
Added to this, Japan's political upheavals coincide with the arrival of a
younger generation of men in national politics, keen to raise living
standards and satisfy consumers' interests rather than pander to traditional
vested interests.
A third force for deregulation comes from Japan's foreign trade partners.
The US and the European Union are both increasing pressure on Japan to
stimulate domestic demand as a way of cutting the trade surplus.
That is why all involved agree that Mr Hosokawa has started a process that,
over years, will shake up Japan's industrial system.
'In the longer term, the direction set by these preliminary measures will
impact the future shape of Japanese business, politics and ostensibly the
social structure of the country,' argues a paper by Mr Geoffrey Barker,
chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (4): Battered banks get tough on
lending - Corporate Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<TEXT>
Gathered around a table at the Mikasa Chamber of Commerce, small business
owners in a small town in northern Japan described the pains of recession.
For them, the speculative era of the late 1980s meant a slight rise in
sales, but the following downturn is leaving more obvious scars.
Sales in local stores have fallen, components makers are being squeezed by
their larger customers, and banks are selective about new lending. An
example of the banks' new toughness, a Mikasa company owner explained, was
that they were wary of accepting low-priced local land as collateral and
many companies did not have much else to offer.
But Mikasa companies also have little immediate desire to expand shops or
factories because demand is in decline and there is no need for new
capacity. The corporate reluctance to invest and the banks' increased
emphasis on risk management - in the wake of reckless lending during the
speculative years - form a pattern seen throughout Japan.
Larger companies, which have more access to capital markets, soaked up the
cheap money available during the late 1980s when new issues were easily
digested on the Tokyo stock market. However, the cheapness of new finance
led to a weakening of discipline, and investments in new plant or in
diversification were made without enough concern for profitability, either
on the part of the company or its banks.
One result of that investment binge is a continuing decline in return on
equity for listed Japanese manufacturers, slipping from 8.3 per cent in 1989
to 3.1 per cent last year and an estimated 2.5 per cent or lower this year.
The binge also left Japan's banks with a large pile of non-performing loans
which they have only just begun to clear away.
At the end of March, the 11 leading commercial banks announced an average 70
per cent increase in loan loss reserves for the year, and wrote off Y72.8bn,
an increase of 478 per cent on a year earlier, but a small share of their
then official total of Y8,435bn in problem loans.
Smaller banks, such as the Shinkin, on the lowest rung of the banking
ladder, are under pressure, partly from rash lending in the past but also
because decline in regional areas has hurt their core customers. It is
expected that the average fall in their first-half banking profits will be
30 per cent, while lending increased by a record low of 3 per cent.
The difficulty in estimating the bubble era damage, and in reading
longer-term attitudes to fresh lending, is that the official problem loan
figure does not include the lending of financial affiliates, used by banks
for some of their more adventurous deals during the late 1980s. Banks also
do not calculate the burden of loans to troubled clients on which interest
rates have been delayed or shaved to almost zero as part of a restructuring
package.
Bad loans are likely to be a burden until late in the 1990s and, in the
meantime, Japanese companies will have to deal with banks which are changing
their lending policies. For example, a leading steelmaker said its main bank
had traditionally charged the same interest rate for all companies in the
group, but was now making a distinction, charging higher rates for group
members thought to be exposed to the property downturn.
The head of a publishing company in Tokyo complained that banks were willing
to assist larger customers, but had been unsympathetic in dealing with
smaller companies. The Bank of Japan has concerns about financial
institutions becoming too risk-averse and starving a recovery of funds,
although the bank tends to blame weak demand for the unusually low loan
growth this year.
Banks say they are more than willing to assist good quality customers but
the evidence is that new customers courted during the late 1980s, when
financial institutions expanded rapidly, are receiving less assistance than
the banks' traditional customers.
Ms Tomoko Fujii, economist at Salomon Brothers, said smaller Japanese
companies had sharply increased their borrowing this year from three public
institutions - the Japan Development Bank, the People's Finance Corporation
and the Small Business Finance Corporation - which received an increase in
funds as part of the government's attempts to stimulate growth.
Growth in loans outstanding at the three institutions was 13.7 per cent in
the year to July, compared to the meagre 4.2 per cent growth in the year to
September 1991. These institutions, which provide concessional rates, are
more favoured sources than commercial banks, slow to pass on the benefits of
the fall in official interest rates in the past year.
But Japan's leading life assurers, attempting to increase lending to
industry and reduce the share of securities in their portfolios, say the
demand for loans has been less than they expected. The largest eight life
companies are reported have experienced a 0.1 per cent fall in the ratio of
outstanding loans to total assets in the year to end March.
For much of the past year, Japanese banks were helped by the strength of
Tokyo stock prices, which increased their unrealised gains on securities
holdings. But the recent weakness in the Nikkei average has made the banks
more aware of their vulnerability and puts more pressure on their corporate
customers, also dependent on their equity portfolio as a buffer against the
bad times.
The change in the stock market's mood could prompt Japanese banks to be even
tougher, further undermining corporate confidence. Economic recovery could
hang on the balance between the demand for new loans and the willingness of
Japan's bruised banks to meet that demand.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (2): Complex pattern of
relationships - Industry and Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, and his coalition took
office this year, the party of industry, the Liberal Democratic party, lost
power for the first time in four decades and politicians long cultivated by
companies were sitting in the opposition benches for the first time.
The realignment has disoriented Japanese companies and prompted them to seek
closer relations with the bureaucrats whose power Mr Hosokawa is attempting
to limit through his deregulation drive. Meanwhile, companies are
reassessing the worth of links to LDP politicians - traditionally seen as
representing the construction or trucking industries as much as arguing the
case of their local constituencies.
Within parliament, there are 'tribes' of politicians representing the
interests of various sectors, and these have been dominated by LDP
politicians. An unfolding construction industry scandal has highlighted the
close links in the provinces between companies and the LDP, and similar ties
are maintained with national politicians.
Not only the construction industry had influence. The natural gas industry,
through an economic organisation, bought advertisement space in LDP
publications, including Y230m for six ads last financial year. But the end
of LDP rule does not mean that Japanese companies have no influence over
policy - because they also have close links to the bureaucrats, many of whom
later join companies in the industry they have regulated.
When Mr Hosokawa announced deregulation plans, the leaders of industry
associations welcomed his plans but, at the same time, companies represented
by those associations were queueing for employment 'adjustment subsidies'
and industries were seeking bureaucratic help to cope with a deepening
downturn.
Deregulation is meant to increase competition in Japan, but it would also
mean a new relationship between the administrators and the administered,
which have seen the traditional links with the bureaucracy as both
restraining and reassuring. These links are particularly reassuring when
industry's political influence has declined with the departure of the LDP.
Weaker corporate links with the ministries, which tend to deal with
companies as an industry group rather than individually, would provide more
freedom for aggressive companies to break from the orderly hierarchy that
characterises some Japanese sectors and their courting of politicians.
Japan's leading steel companies all announced losses in the first half this
year, each with an eye on the figures of Nippon Steel, the industry leader.
By selling equities, the companies are able to reduce their losses and
increase profits at will, ensuring that each keeps its acknowledged place in
line.
The link between the regulators and the regulated is one thread in the
complex pattern of relationships, but by tugging at that thread, Mr Hosokawa
could change the shape of the whole in unexpected ways.
Some industries which have been particularly generous political sponsors -
such as those in the transport and construction sectors - will find their
influence on the wane if strict limits are imposed on corporate donations.
Japanese politicians have found ways in the past to get around restrictions
on donations, and are likely to find new routes in the future. But the
hotchpotch nature of the present coalition and its uncertain life has
increased the difficulty for companies attempting to target future leaders
for cultivation.
For example, the orderly queue for ministerial posts and even the prime
ministership provided a guide for companies and industries. In investigating
the construction scandal, prosecutors found that companies had ranked
politicians according to influence, beginning with A+ for the very powerful
and down to D for those hardly worth taking out to dinner.
In finance, the coming of the Hosokawa government has not quickened
liberalisation, which is conducted at a pace directed by the bureaucracy. An
official at one of the long-term credit banks allowed to establish a
securities subsidiary earlier this year complained about the fresh list of
restrictions introduced by the finance ministry, which was reacting to
criticism from existing brokers that the banks would undermine their
industry.
The new subsidiaries are forbidden to share the same office as the parent
bank, their staff must wear a uniform that is distinctively different from
that of the bank staff, and their staff are unable to accompany bank staff
on a client call. In effect, the bank official said, many of the advantages
of deregulation have been lost in the new regulations.
Banks are being allowed to enter new business in small groups, beginning
with the long-term credit banks and ending with the commercial banks. Their
access to new products is determined by the finance ministry, not by demand
from customers, whose views are barely represented by politicians or
bureaucrats.
Changing the regulations will not necessarily change the way Japanese
companies are treated. Companies are wary of treading on ministerial toes,
fearing that a licence for a new product or that recession-linked assistance
could be delayed by the small group of bureaucrats responsible for approving
these matters.
Japan's shipbuilders can testify to the power of the bureaucracy, as they
were officially in recession until three years ago, following the downturn
created by the yen's rise in the mid-1980s. As a result of technological
improvements during that period, assisted by a range of government
subsidies, the industry emerged from recession with a half share of the
world market.
By the end of April this year, Japan's car companies and computer makers had
joined a list of 138 sectors eligible for government assistance in
'employment adjustment', covering the transfer of workers within companies,
retraining and early retirement schemes. None of the companies wants this
type of government intervention to end.
This message will be passed on by political colleagues to Mr Hosokawa, now
attempting to clear a path through the regulations holding back growth. He
will find that many Japanese companies are reluctant to sever a network of
ties among the bureaucracy, other companies in the same sector, and
politicians that has served them well.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (3): Concern mounts over moves
to shift production overseas - Foreign Takeovers and Investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The truth is that there is no work left any more,' moans Mr Masao Saito,
head of the International Technical Business Association, which is helping a
group of small and medium-sized Japanese companies from Gumma prefecture to
set up operations together in an industrial park in China.
The decision by these small companies to combine forces and move to China
reflects the desperate situation they face as their traditional customers,
the larger Japanese manufacturers, transfer more of their production
overseas.
The sharp rise of the yen since the beginning of the year has meant that
hardly a day goes by without one Japanese company or another announcing a
new investment or expansion of already existing facilities abroad,
particularly in Asia.
In the mid to late 1980s the move by Japanese manufacturers to set up
operations overseas was considered a political necessity. Words such as
globalisation and local procurement became corporate mantras and Japanese
foreign investment reached Dollars 67.5bn in fiscal 1989 alone, according to
Ministry of Finance statistics.
Overall, recent Japanese investment overseas has tailed off since then as
most of the companies that needed to have established a presence in key
markets outside of Japan and as the plunge in asset prices and slowdown of
the Japanese economy has dented corporate profits.
The level of investment overseas declined to Dollars 34.1bn in the last
fiscal year.
But with the yen's rise, overseas investment has once again become a
necessity for the corporate survival of many manufacturing companies for
economic rather than political reasons.
The moves to shift production overseas, coinciding this time with a
recessionary environment and worries about rising unemployment at home, have
raised concerns that Japan's industrial competitiveness will be undermined
by the move of jobs and technologies overseas.
'If the yen continues at this level, we may have to move more production
overseas,' warns Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president of Matsushita,
the consumer electronics company.
But the company is considering its moves cautiously because of the need to
maintain jobs at home, he notes.
Others, such as Aiwa, a medium-sized specialised audio company, have
transferred the bulk of their manufacturing overseas in an attempt to
survive the impact on its costs of the high yen.
The yen's rise is not just encouraging the shift of production to lower cost
bases such as south-east Asia.
The need to reduce costs substantially in order to maintain cost
competitiveness has also led to increased purchases of components from
cheaper sources outside Japan.
As the yen climbed from an exchange rate of Y124 to the dollar at the
beginning to the year to Y115 to the dollar by April, imports of major
electronic components and equipment from Asia, including China, have surged.
In the first six months of the year, the dollar value of imports of office
machinery from China tripled from the same period in the previous year while
that of electronic components more than doubled, according to statistics
from the Ministry of Finance.
From member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations
(Asean), then, office machinery imports rose 80 per cent while that of
electronic devices increased 27 per cent and the picture is similar for
imports from the newly industrialised countries.
Many Japanese computer makers have begun to procure some models in their PC
line-up from lower cost sources overseas. Matsushita, for one, has set up a
special unit to concentrate on procuring components from cheaper sources
abroad.
These moves may help to maintain the competitiveness of the large
manufacturers but the worry is that they are hurting the vast number of
Japanese component makers which have been a crucial factor behind the
country's industrial might.
As one Japanese manufacturer after another moves production overseas or
looks outside of Japan for cheaper parts, Japan's small and medium-sized
suppliers have been left behind to watch the industrial landscape at home
being transformed by the manufacturing exodus.
Some, such as the electronic components maker Sanritsu, which has seen a
large proportion of its business evaporate with the decision by its parent
company to procure parts from cheaper sources in Asia, are being forced to
close factories.
Even the more fortunate suppliers are being encouraged to diversify and
reduce their traditional reliance on the parent company.
Nevertheless, despite growing signs of pressure on Japan's myriad suppliers,
opinion is divided over whether the current trend will eventually lead to a
hollowing out of Japanese industry.
The doomsayers who believe jobs and manufacturing technology are moving out
of Japan, point out that the need for large manufacturers to shift
production overseas in order to remain competitive means that their
suppliers must also either move out of Japan or face consolidation.
Against those concerns, the optimists say that investment overseas by
Japanese companies has not risen so dramatically as to warrant concern.
They also argue that Japanese industry has been shifting to more value-added
products to make up for the gradual loss of commodity manufacturing to
overseas industries.
'Japan has a high level of technology and education, so I am not worried
about hollowing out,' says Mr Atsushi Kameno at the Ministry of Labour.
Japanese manufacturers - faced with the dilemma posed by, on the one hand
pressure to shift more production overseas and, on the other, the need to
maintain a strong manufacturing base at home - have generally kept to a
policy of shifting low technology production overseas while gradually moving
the emphasis of their businesses to higher value-added products.
They are also being forced, during the current squeeze on costs, to focus
their energies and their R&amp;D funds even more than before on areas which they
have defined as key technologies.
Many electronics companies, for example, are increasing investments in
liquid crystal displays and other key devices which are expected to see
growing demand with advances in information technology.
If the current environment encourages such concentration on winning
technologies it may help, rather than weaken, the ability of Japanese
companies to come up with high value-added products to replace commodity
manufacturing.
That in turn would help maintain Japan's industrial progress.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (1): Potential for growth is
diminished - Previous recessions were like a broken limb, and Japan quickly
recovered. But this one is like a disorder of the circulation, which takes
longer to cure. The government's medicine has not yet revitalised the
patient's system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A salutary message has dawned on Japan's industrial companies as they face,
in 1993, their fourth consecutive year of profits decline. The message is
that this recession, the worst for 20 years, is wider and deeper than other
downturns, for several reasons.
What used to be the two main growth sectors of Japan's industrial economy,
cars and consumer electronics, are entering a probably longer-than-usual
period of slow growth. Yet there is no obvious new growth industry to
succeed them.
Secondly, this recession has exposed overcapacity that many leading
companies suspected was there during the previous downturn in 1986, but
which was then concealed by the fast rise in consumption - and industrial
investment - at the end of the 1980s.
They already knew that Japanese-based manufacturing was being made
uncompetitive by the yen's rise over the years. They had accordingly started
to cut costs and shift production overseas, first to the UK and continental
Europe and then to the fast-growing industrial economies of south-east Asia.
This year's unexpected fresh surge in the yen suggests that industry might
after all be only at the start of relocating production outside Japan,
prompting fears of a so-called 'hollowing out' of domestically-based
industry.
How industry will respond to the shift in production and to the maturity of
cars and electronics is the question now being discussed anxiously in Tokyo
boardrooms. Companies used to look for guidance on big strategic issues like
this to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), the body
which was mainly responsible for Japan's post-war success in spotting new
growth industries to succeed the old.
But today, Miti has no clear answers to these new challenges. Its officials
argue that centralised industrial planning is unsuitable for the open market
economy which Japan has become, and that the best Miti can do is to help
industries to reflect on the future. For the first time, the private sector
may have to find its own way to the next phase of industrial development.
Finally, previous recessions, unlike this one, were triggered by external
shocks, such as the 1973 oil price shock, or the rise in the value of the
yen, sparked by the 1985 Plaza accord to curb the appreciation of the
dollar.
Yet this recession is only partly related to the yen's continued rise. It
also has internal causes such as companies' unwillingness to invest - in
contrast with their tendency to increase capacity in previous recessions, in
the hope of better times around the corner.
This time, however, the better times are proving slower to emerge. Japan's
economic growth rate has fallen back for nearly four years running. Industry
will cut capital investment for the fourth consecutive year in 1994,
according to a recent survey by the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
Most economists think that gross national product will stagnate or fall by a
fraction of a percentage point this year - the first year-on-year fall since
1974 - after 1.5 per cent growth in 1992. Even the government's Economic
Planning Agency, often criticised for being over-optimistic, has abandoned
its 3.3 per cent target for economic growth this year.
As one senior Japanese securities company executive puts it, previous
recessions broke a limb, from which Japan quickly recovered, while this one
is like a disorder of the circulation, which takes longer to cure. The
government's medicine, including interest rate cuts, and about Y30,000bn of
pump-priming measures over the past 13 months, have not yet revitalised the
patient's system. The one available measure not yet tried is an income tax
cut, and that is likely early next year.
There were signs that the economy might pick up in the spring, but since
then economists have steadily downgraded their forecasts as a stream of
gloomy indicators have shown that spring was a false start. Industrial
output is on the slide, down 5 per cent year-on-year in September, for the
24th month running, the longest decline on record.
One structural weakness revealed by Japan's recession is the faltering
supply of credit. Banks are still scarred by the collapse in asset prices
that came with the start of the downturn, a problem highlighted when
Muramoto Construction, a medium-sized contractor, sought protection from its
creditors early last month with debts of Y590bn, Japan's largest post-war
financial collapse.
A sharp decline in loan growth which began three years ago shows no signs of
easing. Officially, bad debts account for 3 per cent of the leading banks'
loans, although the proportion rises to nearly 10 per cent if the more
stringent US definition of what constitutes a bad loan is applied, says Ms
Alicia Ogawa, investment analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, the securities
house.
Banks deny that they are being too cautious. There are clear signs that
demand for credit is just as weak as supply, despite the Bank of Japan's
decision to cut its official discount rate by three-quarters of a percentage
point in September to a record low of 1.75 per cent.
Corporate Japan has, as it usually does, reacted to its problems rapidly.
The first sign that the industry's response to the downturn had entered a
new phase came early this year when Nissan became the first Japanese
carmaker since the second world war to announce a plant closure - at Zama,
near Tokyo, with the loss of 5,000 jobs over the next three years.
Nissan's motives are echoed across Japanese industry. The group had cut
costs in previous downturns, 'but then we tended to put on more weight, more
fat than before,' when a recovery materialised, said Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji,
Nissan's president. The Zama closure is part of a plan to reduce capacity
from 2.5m units a year to 2.3m units over the next three years. This time,
the group will stay smaller, says Mr Tsuji.
Industrial cost-cutting entered another important phase in September when
NTT, the telecommunications group and a pillar of the industrial
establishment, announced that it would shed 10,000 staff, through voluntary
retirement, by next year.
This was significant because it reduced other companies' inhibitions about
cutting jobs, still seen as socially unacceptable in Japan. In the weeks
that followed, the Toshiba electronics group announced that it was to cut
5,000 jobs; Honda the carmaker 3,000; and Kawasaki Steel 3,200, to cite just
some of the most prominent.
However, one taboo remains intact - Japanese companies' reluctance to impose
straightforward redundancies. All the job losses announced so far by leading
industrial companies will take place over a period of years and will be
achieved through methods that appear painless by the standards of US or
European competitors.
These include cutting down on recruitment, not replacing people who retire,
or requiring surplus staff to move to other divisions or affiliate
companies, some of which can be geographically remote.
This has enabled Japan to keep its unemployment rate low, at about 2.5 per
cent. This does not include the estimated 800,000-1.2m employees who are
surplus to companies' needs but are still kept on payrolls.
One consequence of Japanese industry's relatively gentle approach to job
reductions has been to increase the pressure on salaries. Companies'
determination to cut payroll costs is underlined by the present negotiations
on bonuses, an important part of total salaries. The electronics industry
has set the tone by cutting bonuses to the lowest level for 18 years,
prompting uncharacteristic complaints from normally compliant unions. Car
and steel industries are taking an equally tough line, likely to be
continued when Japanese industry embarks on its annual wage round next
spring.
All this has provoked widespread questioning - by both companies and
employees - of Japan's social contract of a job for life in return for
complete loyalty to the company. The car industry has already long
experience of using temporary workers to increase flexibility and thus cut
costs. But now an increasing number of big industrial groups, such as Sony
and Toyota, are trying to employ a small proportion of people who are not
expected to stay with the company all their lives.
The industrial consequence of surpluses in the workforce, the maturity of
cars and electronics and the banking system's weakness, is to diminish
Japan's growth potential.
For the past few decades, Japanese industry has always planned on the basis
of fast growth - hence its former reputation of chasing turnover at the
expense of profits. In the next few years it can expect economic growth of
between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent, roughly a percentage point less than in
the 1980s, forecasts Mr Peter Tasker, chief strategist at securities house,
Kleinwort Benson, in Tokyo.
All this indicates that Japanese industry is on the threshold of what will
be a new experience for it: how to switch from the strategic offensive, to
adjusting to a slow growth world.

The European Commission is facing calls from animal welfare groups to
restrict the trade in live animals between member countries as it prepares a
transit directive for discussion at the next meeting of agriculture
ministers on December 13.
Pressure groups throughout Europe have formed a committee to urge the
commission to lower maximum journey times for animals sent to slaughter
across country borders.
Livestock can currently travel for 24 hours non-stop across the European
Union although the UK imposes its own limit of 15 hours before lorries have
to stop to feed and water the animals.
Animal welfare campaigners are calling for journey times to be cut to 8
hours, although the Germans want to go further and impose a 6-hour limit on
journeys. Denmark and the Netherlands are believed to be sympathetic to the
proposals.
In Britain, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
been running a series of emotive advertisements about conditions experienced
by UK lambs heading for the continent. 'Before they're roasted in garlic and
rosemary, they're soaked in urine and excrement,' runs the text of one.
'We have scientific evidence that shows journey times over 8 hours cause
significant stress in the animals,' an official said.
The RSPCA says public opinion over the transport of live animals is running
high, but it has so far received little support from the UK government for
its campaign.
Separately, Labour MPs have joined the RSPCA in calling on Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister, to ban the export of lambs from the UK to
Spain following revelations about inhumane conditions in abattoirs.
Although it costs more to transport live animals than carcases, the trade in
living animals, particularly shipments of lambs from the UK to France and
Spain, has grown in recent years. Exporters have been encouraged by demand
for live lambs in France following shortfalls in home production.
If lambs are slaughtered in French abattoirs, they can be classed as
home-produced and command higher prices than imported carcases. This can
more than cover the costs of exporting.
The trade in live animals from the UK, particularly sheep, destined for
slaughter has grown from around 2m animals last year to an estimated 3m this
year following changes in rules that made exports more competitive.
The UK lifted a ban on the export of live lambs to Spain at the beginning of
the year with the introduction of the EU's single market. The government is
fighting a claim for damages of more than Pounds 1m from Hedley Lomas, an
Irish exporter based in the UK, which was refused export licences for live
sheep from 1990 to 1992.
The RSPCA says the government could act unilaterally to ban the export of
live animals to Spain again on moral grounds. The UK government says the
commission must enforce rules on slaughter methods in Spanish abattoirs.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium glut talks 'positive'

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Multilateral talks on the problems of the world aluminium market had
generated 'positive' momentum but were likely to end with no more than a
'broad framework' for easing the current oversupply, the head of a US
industry group said as government delegates prepared to complete a two-day
session here, reports Reuter from Washington.
Mr David Parker, president of the Aluminum Association, added that another
session of talks would probably be held during the next six weeks.
Speaking after a closed-door briefing by US government negotiators, Mr
Parker added that, 'there's been no discussion of formulas or numbers'. And
he thought no such discussion was likely yesterday.
Government officials from the US, Russia, Australia, Canada, Norway and the
European Union met on Wednesday to discuss ways of resolving the world
aluminium glut, following talks earlier in the day that included industry
representatives. The meeting was continuing yesterday.
Mr Parker noted that a number of factors made a quick agreement unlikely,
including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and the coming
parliamentary elections in Russia, the main source of the flood of aluminium
that has undermined the western market since the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
He nevertheless expressed satisfaction with the talks so far, which were
scheduled as a follow-up to multilateral talks held in Moscow in late
October.
'The momentum that was generated at (Wednesday's) discussion we find to be
positive,' he said.
He added, however, that the urgency of the issue was such that governments
would be placed under pressure to find a solution.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaican bauxite sector feels
the pinch - Low prices are threatening expansions plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jamaica's bauxite mining and refining industry is weighing carefully the
depressed state of the international aluminium market, hoping that companies
operating in the island will not be dissuaded from continuing a USDollars
500m investment programme over the next seven years.
As the world's third largest producer of bauxite (aluminium ore), however,
the island is feeling the effects of falling metal prices. Ore production,
which slipped last year by 1.5 per cent to 11.3m tonnes, is expected to be
unchanged this year, as is alumina (aluminium oxide) production, at 3m
tonnes.
It is in the earnings from the industry - an important component of the
island's narrow economy - that Jamaica is feeling the pressure. Mr Carlton
Davis, chairman of the Jamaica Bauxite Institute, says that the soft metal
market is depressing Jamaica's earnings from bauxite and alumina, most of
which is through production levies and income taxes.
While bauxite production fell only marginally last year, the island's
earnings from the industry declined by a hefty 13.6 per cent to Dollars
577m. Jamaica will be fortunate if earnings amount to Dollars 500m this
year, Dollars 200m less than two years ago, says Mr Davis. This forecast is
supported by figures showing bauxite production in the first three quarters
of this year down 1.4 per cent from a year ago, with alumina output little
changed.
Earnings have also been depressed by a steady depreciation of the Jamaican
dollar over the past two years, with mining and refining companies spending
less to meet local costs.
'The current state of the market might lead some companies to reconsider
their capital programmes,' says Mr Davis. 'But conventional wisdom in the
industry is that it is in times like these that one prepares to meet an
upturn in the market.'
The aim of the Jamaican industry is to lift refinery capacity, which is now
being fully utilised, to 5m tonnes a year by the year 2000. The Jamalco
refinery in central Jamaica, owned jointly by the island's government and
the Aluminum Company of America, is being expanded to a rated capacity of 1m
tonnes a year, from 700,000, at a cost of about Dollars 60m. Already under
consideration is a later expansion that could lift capacity to 2m tonnes a
year.
Alumina Partners of Jamaica, owned by Kaiser of the US and Hydro Aluminum of
Norway, is spending Dollars 200m to increase the output from the island's
largest refinery to 1.5m tonnes year, and then to 2m tonnes by the turn of
the century.
Two refineries operated by Alcan of Canada, with a combined capacity of 1.1m
tonnes a year, are being refurbished to lift output to 1.5m tonnes. Mr Davis
says that the plants could be further expanded to produce 2m tonnes a year,
using a grade of ore that was not yet being processed by the company.
While there is optimism that the state of the industry will not adversely
affect these expansion plans, there has been reconsideration of two
ventures. The governments of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago had been
discussing the construction of an aluminium smelter in Trinidad, using a
'modular' system, starting with a small plant and enlarging in stages to
meet market demand. Both governments were considering starting with a
'module' with a plant of 55,000 tonnes per year. Mr Davis says this project
is not now being given priority because of the state of the market, and
uncertainty over the cost of the local natural gas which would fuel the
plant.
The industry's plans also included the construction of a caustic soda plant
to reduce reliance on imports to meet the demand for 300,000 tonnes per year
for the refineries. The project for a 50,000 tonnes-a-year plant has been
put back, Mr Davis said, because of a significant drop in world prices of
caustic soda.
In a longer term project, the Jamaican industry is testing ore deposits in
the north and north-western districts that could supply one or two new
refineries. The island's government is planning an approach to multilateral
financial institutions, and to aluminium majors, in an effort to stimulate
interest in financing and operating the refineries. If these projects are
not feasible, the ores will be used to feed the expanded refineries, Mr
Davis says.
'Jamaica is one of several locations which can attract new investment in the
industry,' he acknowledges. 'There are many questions being asked about the
continued efficiency of plants in North America and Europe. Along with
Australia, India, Brazil and Venezuela, Jamaica is a profitable location for
added production. The industry is very competitive.'

FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru's mining giant up for sale
next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Centromin, Peru's state-owned mining and refining giant, will go on the
auction block early next year, company president Mr Hernan Barreto told
delegates to Metals Bulletin's Latin America conference, which opened in
Lima yesterday.
According to Mr Barreto, the company has a portfolio of 22 mining projects
all over Peru 'waiting for investors to come along', in addition to the
seven units currently operating. In all it has over 2,000m tonnes of proven
and probable reserves, The most important projects are Toromocho and
Antamina, which have pre-feasibility studies completed and are intended to
replace Centromin's Cobriza copper mine, where reserves are expected to run
out in six years.
Centromin is a vast mining and metallurgical complex that has developed over
90 years (until 1974 operated by the US-based Cerro de Pasco Corporation).
The decision has been definitively taken to sell it as a single unit.
Mr Barreto was coy about the actual value he would place on Centromin,
although he mentioned 'several hundred million (dollars)'. Assets total
Dollars 1.6bn, he said, but the new owner would have to assume substantial
company liabilities as well.
The sale of what Mr Barreto admitted was a hugely complex asset will be
facilitated if secondary debt paper is accepted. A new law, passed by Peru's
Congress on 19 November, sets the framework for Peruvian debt to be used in
privatisation - under this ruling a minimum 10 per cent will still have to
be paid in cash. Precise details are to be worked out on a case-by-case
basis but the prospect was viewed with 'great enthusiasm', Mr Barreto said.
Twenty-four companies pre-qualified to bid for Centromin, but an unspecified
number have pulled out as a consequence of the decision not to split the
company into separate units. According to Mr Barreto, 'three or four' major
international companies remain seriously interested and are forming bidding
consortia - industry sources say these include Mexico's Penoles, Britain's
RTZ, Cominco of Canada and South Korea's Daewoo.
For all its problems - of which environmental pollution is perhaps the most
daunting - Centromin looks a much more attractive investment prospect today
than it did two years ago. Under a new, private-sector board, a 1991 loss of
Dollars 163m was turned into pre-tax profits of Dollars 26m last year. Poor
international minerals prices this year pushed profits to September down to
just under Dollars 4m, however.
But, says the indefatigably optimistic Mr Barreto, Centromin is a 'very
attractive prospect'. It is polymetallic (40 per cent of current income
comes from zinc, 28 per cent from copper, 20 per cent from silver and 11 per
cent from lead) so income is diversified and partially protected from price
fluctuations. It is a going concern with a wide range of assets and
projects. And, importantly for the future owner, the workforce has been
sharply reduced from 19,000 two years ago to today's 11,700, while at the
same time output has been increased.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians 'losing cost
advantage'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Russian aluminium producers 'are starting to price themselves out of world
markets', according to a study by the Anthony Bird consultancy.
Russian production costs, which in mid-1993 were 61 per cent of western
levels, up from 46 per cent a year earlier, last month reached 94 per cent
and are 'still rising', Bird says. 'The flood of metal from east to west
will cease,' it suggests, as only two Russian smelters are likely to be
competitive in the longer term.
Bird calculates average western operating costs at 51.5 cents a pound,
compared with a market price yesterday of 49.2 cents. Inclusion of capital
servicing costs and normal profits raises the costs figure to 64.7 cents a
pound.

The Australian market, after easing throughout last week, stabilised when
sales were resumed and showed a little morestrength yesterday. This
represents an overall picture as indicated by the Australian Wool
Corporation's market indicator, which a week ago was 468 cents a kg., and by
yesterday was at 469 cents. Some wool types eased, mainly finer Merinos, but
others were firm to dearer, with middle range Merino fleece in strong demand
yesterday at Adelaide. Trade generally subsided a couple of weeks ago with

FT  03 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate cut prompts sell-off at
long end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's latest rate cut fuelled easing hopes among Germany's
European neighbours, prompting investors to shift funds into shorter
maturities and causing yield curves to steepen.
While the Bundesbank left its discount and Lombard rates unchanged, it cut
its rate for securities repurchase agreements by  1/4 point and set 6 per
cent fixed-rate repos for the next five weeks.
The German yield curve steepened after the Bundesbank's announcement, with
10-year yields rising by two basis points and the rate for three-month
Eurodeposits falling by 13 basis points.
With the repo rate fixed for the next five weeks, a widespread feeling that
there will be no more key rate cuts until January caused the sell-off at the
long end, said Torsten Bohler, bond analyst with UBS.
The longer-dated sector was also damped by the announcement of new
ultra-long supply after the Bundesbank cancelled the 10-year bund issue
scheduled for December and announced the auction of a new tranche of 6 per
cent bonds due 2016.
The December bund future fell 0.22 point to 99.68, while the three-month
Euromark future climbed 0.06 point to 93.92.
The Bundesbank's rate cut fuelled speculation that France may soon deliver
its long-awaited rate cut, with some traders betting on a  1/4 -point rate
cut as soon as today, or a cut in the 6.45 per cent intervention rate at
Monday's Bank of France repo.
But others said the French authorities may prefer to wait until Germany
lowers its official rates before following suit. According to Mr Michael
O'Hanlon, chief international economist with Kidder, Peabody Securities, the
French authorities do not want to risk pressuring the franc by a unilateral
cut in official rates.
Moreover, he said France still has to repay some of the intervention funds
it borrowed during last summer's currency crisis, and needs to fully
replenish its foreign currency reserves before being in a comfortable
position to cut rates.
The December notional bond future on Matif ended 0.10 point lower at 124.10
while the three-month Pibor future rose 0.08 point to 93.60.
UK gilt traders also reported heavy demand for short-dated debt as investors
took profits at the long end. The March long gilt futures contract slipped
by  5/16 to 116 3/4 .
Italian bonds weakened further on political worries ahead of the second
round of municipal elections on Sunday. The March BTP contract on Liffe fell
0.42 point to 111.43.
However, some said this represents a buying opportunity for medium-term
investors. 'Italian bonds are getting to very attractive levels,' said Marc
Hendricks, head of international bond research at Swiss Bank Corporation.
US Treasury bond prices softened yesterday as the market digested a batch of
second-tier economic statistics and awaited the government's report on
November employment due out today.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 99,
with the yield edging higher to 6.268 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.20 per cent.
The market weathered the day's generally upbeat readings on the economy with
little fanfare. Prices inched ahead soon after the release of the data,
mainly because the figures were in line with expectations.
The Commerce Department said personal income in October had risen 0.6 per
cent from September to October, and personal consumption climbed 0.8 per
cent. The Labor Department, meanwhile, said initial claims for state
unemployment benefit last week showed a modest decline.
More favourably for bonds, October sales of new homes dipped 6.5 per cent
against September's figure, which was revised downward.
However, prices slipped into negative territory as the morning progressed
amid speculation that the Clinton administration may support an increase in
short-term interest rates early next year.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Treuhand is to shift
borrowing to longer term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency will shift its borrowing to
longer-term instruments because of lower interest rates, Mr Heinrich Hornef,
a member of the board said yesterday.
The Treuhand, which was set up in 1990 to privatise and restructure eastern
German industry, will have a deficit of DM216bn by the end of 1994, and will
have a total accumulated debt of DM275bn.
At the same time, the net borrowing requirement for the Treuhand will total
DM44bn for 1994, of which DM38bn will be earmarked for running costs. The
remaining DM6bn will be used to service the interest from the
Krediabwicklungsfond, the government-backed fund set up to cover the debt of
the former east Germany.
The DM44bn will be raised through bonds and medium-term notes. But Treuhand
officials said the agency would focus on longer-term financing because of
the gradual fall in Germany's interest rates.
By the end of 1993, the agency will have borrowed a total of DM133bn through
bonds and Treuhand obligations, or medium-term issues.
The agency has a net borrowing requirement of DM44bn in 1994, and on top of
this it has DM39bn of old debt, which is due to be paid back, and will be
restructured.
The agency is due to be dissolved late next year, after it had privatised
more than 12,000 of enterprises placed under its control.
By October, the agency had 1,392 enterprises on its books. It had obtained
DM181.6bn of investment commitments, earned DM44.3bn in sales, and secured
1.48m job guarantees.
However, these investment and employment commitments are not indefinite.
Many are spread out over a maximum of five years. To monitor the
implementation of these contracts, the Treuhand has set up a special
contracts department which will not be wound up until the contracts expire.
However, the agency will be still be saddled with about 500 enterprises.
Some have already been placed in Management KGs - enterprises which the
Treuhand will pass on to west German managers for restructuring and
preparation for privatisation. The agency has allocated more than DM17.3bn
for this purpose.
Apart from the Management KGs, the Treuhand will be left with some of the
most difficult enterprises to restructure and privatise. These include
Deutsche Waggonbau, the rail carriage manufacturers, Sket, the large machine
tool complex, and the chemical sectors of Leuna and Buna.
Beyond that, the agency will invest DM4.3bn in eastern Germany's chemical
sector, which has yet to be privatised. It will also earmark a further
DM5.4bn for environmental clean up and land reclamation of chemical and
brown coal mines which have been closed.
Mr Hornef said he expected the agency to earn about DM11bn from
privatisation sales next year, which include selling off Veag, eastern
Germany's largest utility company.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Merck raises Dollars 250m to finance
Medco purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merck, the large US pharmaceuticals group, yesterday made its first
appearance in the Eurobond market in order to help finance its Dollars 6bn
acquisition of Medco Containment, a drugs mail order company.
The triple-A rated borrower raised Dollars 250m through an issue of
five-year Eurobonds which were priced to yield 15 basis points over US
Treasuries, in line with market expectations.
The scarcity of top-quality corporate issuance in the Eurobond market
contributed to the success of Merck's debut offering. 'Although the market
is not in fantastic shape, the transaction has gone very well,' said lead
manager Morgan Stanley.
Syndicate managers at other banks described the issue as a 'blowout'.
Investor demand for the bonds was such that when the bonds were freed to
trade the spread tightened to 13 basis points. Morgan Stanley said that more
than half of the bonds were sold to investors in the UK and Switzerland,
with the remainder being placed elsewhere in Europe.
Mr John Kearney, Merck's assistant treasurer, said that the proceeds of the
issue would be used to re-finance some of the short-term funding linked to
the Medco purchase. A good portion of the Dollars 2.4bn cash part of the
acquisition had been raised in the commercial paper market, he said.
According to Morgan Stanley, Merck saved around 10 basis points by tapping
the Eurobond market rather than the US domestic bond market. Mr Kearney
added that Merck could well return to the Eurobond market early next year.
The Bank of Greece also tapped the Eurodollar sector with a widely-expected
Dollars 500m issue of five-year floating-rate notes (FRNs). The notes were
priced to yield 115 basis points over Libor, in line with market
expectations.
Joint lead manager Salomon Brothers said that sales of the bonds had got off
to a good start, with demand coming from eastern Asia and from yield-hungry
investors in Europe. However, the notes were likely to remain in syndicate
for the next couple of days.
The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) raised Fl 300m through an issue
of seven-year Eurobonds, which more or less completed its Dollars 3.8bn
international borrowing programme for this year.
Mr Stephen Abrahams, chief of the IADB's capital markets division, said the
yield spread on the bonds of 13 basis points over Dutch government bonds was
in line with spreads on outstanding bonds issued by other triple A-rated
borrowers. The proceeds of the issue would be kept in guilders.
Mr Abrahams said that the IADB was likely to borrow a similar amount in 1994
but that a larger portion could be raised in dollars.

New Zealand's state-owned Electricity Corporation yesterday announced a
profit of NZDollars 256m (USDollars 140m) for the six months to September
30, almost NZDollars 100m more than in the comparable period last year,
writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The government is under pressure from the business community to privatise
the company, its most valuable remaining unsold state asset. However, this
week the new finance minister Mr Bill Birch repeated the prime minister's
pre-election promise that it would not be sold.
Revenue rose by NZDollars 22m to NZDollars 899m, helped by a 6.2 per cent
rise in volumes. Price rises were limited to 2 per cent, which the company
said meant real prices for electricity had fallen 15 per cent since 1987.
The company had a 12 per cent return on shareholders' funds.

An initial public offering of 60m shares in Pactel, the mobile
communications arm of Pacific Telesis, the Californian-based Baby Bell
telephone company, was priced last night at Dollars 23 a share, raising
nearly Dollars 1.4bn, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The offering is the first stage of a plan by Pacific Telesis to spin off the
company as a separate entity. The remaining Pactel stock - amounting to 80
per cent or more of the total outstanding - will be distributed to existing
Pacific Telesis shareholders in the new year.
The company had been expected to offer the shares at between Dollars 21 and
Dollars 23.
The lead underwriter is Lehman Brothers. Some 42m of the shares are being
sold in the US and the remainder in international markets.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian tax aims to squeeze
out speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A new tax on foreign investment in Brazil's lucrative local currency
fixed-income market - announced as part of the government's plans to tackle
inflation - is expected to squeeze out most short-term speculators who had
been taking advantage of real annual interest rates of up to 20 per cent.
But a new tax on Eurobond issues by Brazilian companies announced at the
same time probably will not reduce new issue volume significantly, according
to bankers in Brazil. Banks, the biggest issuers, are expected to pass on
the extra cost to the local borrowers. For private sector companies, it will
remain much cheaper to go to the Euromarkets than to local lenders.
The government's moves are aimed at stemming the huge tide of dollars
entering the country, attracted by a high real interest rate policy which
aims to combat inflation. The inflow is itself inflationary, since the
central bank is obliged to issue local currency, the cruzeiro real, in
exchange for foreign currency. This increases the money supply and helps to
sustain Brazil's chronic inflation, now nearly 2,000 per cent a year.
'The measures are understandable and will help the government's
macroeconomic plans,' said Mr Vincent Parkin, Brazilian representative for
CS First Boston.
Last Thursday, the government ruled that foreigners investing in
fixed-income instruments will have to pay a financial operations tax at 5
per cent on the capital they bring into Brazil, which will have to be
channelled mainly to a new type of fixed-income fund for overseas investors
to be managed by the private sector. Issuers of Eurobonds will have to pay 3
per cent tax on the money they raise.
Money market traders said that investors would have to leave their money in
the new funds for at least five to six months to make paying the tax
worthwhile.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shuwa, a Japanese stock and real estate speculator, is to sell its 26.7 per
cent stake in leading department store Isetan, built during the Tokyo stock
market boom of the late 1980s.
The country's retail industry has been closely following developments
surrounding Shuwa's stake in Isetan, after leading supermarket operators and
department stores wanting to expand their businesses offered to buy the
shares off the ailing stock specu-lator.
Before its downfall, Shuwa invested heavily in leading retailers - much of
which has been bought by Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain.
Mr Kazumasa Koshiba, president of Isetan, said Shuwa would sell the 58.8m
shares to 41 companies at Y1,300 per share. The announcement, made after the
market closed, may pull down Isetan's share price, which finished at Y1,780
on the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday.
Mr Koshiba said the price was decided on the advice of Nikko Securities, its
leading underwriter, and was based on prices of other department store
shares. Shuwa will receive Y76.4bn (Dollars 70m) from the equity sale.
Of the 41 companies which will take on Isetan stock, three are financial and
38 non-financial.
Although Mitsubishi Bank, Isetan's main creditor and shareholder, will not
buy any of the shares, eight companies belonging to the Mitsubishi keiretsu,
or corporate grouping, will be among the purchasing companies.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: No news is bad news at Saudi
bank - Mark Nicholson, recently in Jeddah, discovers the good figures but
not the bad at NCB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first gesture of Mr Abdulhadi Shayif, deputy general manager of National
Commercial Bank (NCB), as he greets visitors in his lofty office overlooking
Jeddah is to hand over a slim 12-page brochure containing the bank's results
for 1991 and 1992. 'It makes a nice change to be able to give people
something,' he says, with open delight.
His delight is not surprising. The figures are the first that Saudi Arabia's
biggest and oldest bank has published in three years, and the first passed
unqualified by the bank's auditors since 1987. They cap, Mr Shayif says, the
end of a troubled few years for a bank which was a foundation stone of the
kingdom's banking system and is probably still its best connected financial
institution - meaning closest to the ruling al-Saud family. 'The abnormal
period is over,' he says.
The figures show the bank returned a profit in 1992 of SR427m (Dollars
114m), up 168 per cent on 1991. No results, however, have been released for
1990. Says Mr Shayif: 'They were audited but are not available for
publication.' Asked if they show a loss, he replies 'no comment'.
NCB's missing 1990 results are a clue to the damage done by six years of
internal disputes over non-performing loans - the cause of the auditors'
qualification and last year's suspension of the bank's credit rating by
Cyprus-based ratings agency Capital Intelligence. There was also last year's
indictment in New York of Mr Khalid bin Mahfouz, then chief operating
officer, on fraud charges connected with the BCCI scandal.
Mr bin Mahfouz has since resigned, and the BCCI affair is dismissed by Mr
Shayif as 'a separate and personal issue - the damage is behind us and the
confidence of international banks is back'.
Nevertheless, that affair, along with the non-appearance of results,
contributed to NCB's closure of its New York, London and Cayman Islands
branches - in the former cases under pressure from the US and British
authorities - which stripped Dollars 2.5bn from its total customer deposits.
These closures, says Mr Shayif, are the reason deposits have fallen to
Dollars 13bn from Dollars 17bn between 1989 and 1992. The bank's balance
sheet has shrunk to Dollars 17bn at the end of 1992 from Dollars 23bn in
1989, while its market share of commercial banking assets in Saudi Arabia
has slipped to 22 per cent from 34 per cent.
The bank's notorious and mysterious bad debts are also a thing of the past,
Mr Shayif says. 'You could now classify our portfolio as normal, and the
provisions are quite adequate,' he says. However, the provisions shown in
the 1992 figures merely hint at the debt problem bank analysts believe NCB
has now put behind it. These totalled SR470m in 1991 and SR81m in 1992.
But according to analysts at Capital Intelligence, which last month
reinstated NCB's credit rating, loan loss provisions taken by the bank since
1980 - including CI's own estimate of provisions or write-offs made in 1990
 -probably amount to nearer SR10bn, suggesting problem loans were between 25
and 30 per cent of its entire portfolio. Mr Shayif has no comment on the
debts - which have been shrouded in speculation for years and attributed to
what analysts wryly describe as 'very senior Saudis'.
In 1991, the accounts also show that the bank allocated the full balance of
its other capital reserves, a total of SR910m, as provisions against the
'decline in value of investments', which CI takes to mean cover for about 70
per cent of the bank's residual holding of BCCI convertible bonds.
But the longest awaited step in restoring the bank to a sounder footing was
the decision of the bin Mahfouz family to recapitalise NCB with an injection
of SR6bn - a considerably greater capitalisation than anyone in the Saudi
banking industry had expected and one which makes the bank the biggest in
the kingdom, not only by assets but also capital base. The move brings NCB's
BIS formula risk/asset ratio to a comfortable 13.76 per cent, according to
CI.
For the present, the recapitalisation has not altered the shareholding
structure of Saudi Arabia's only privately-owned bank, which is 90.5 per
cent in the hands of the bin Mahfouz family with most of the remainder held
by members of the Kaki family.
Mr Shayif says the injection has taken the form of bridging finance, until
the two shareholding families determine how and if the shareholding is to be
altered. He adds that the move is also likely to defer for the foreseeable
future any plans to float part or all the bank's shares on the Saudi stock
market - an option which had been under consideration last year.
Mr Shayif denies that NCB's internal problems caused it to take its eye off
its place in an increasingly sophisticated, profitable and competitive Saudi
banking market, where consolidated profits in the sector rose by 29 per cent
in 1992 and are about 25 per cent up for the first three quarters of 1993.
But while the bank claims a lead in the number and efficiency of its ATMs,
an edge in the breadth of its local coverage and market leadership in unit
fund management in the kingdom, NCB has undeniably lost market share to
nimbler rivals - notably such joint-venture banks as Saudi British Bank,
Saudi American Bank and Saudi Hollandi Bank.
But the bank hopes to address this with the appointment earlier this year of
Mr Michael Callen, former head of Citibank's global finance operations, as
special adviser on a management restructuring. Costs are being cut, staff
reduced by 10 per cent to 6,900 by the year end and a programme of
rationalisation and modernisation is under way. If all of this has the
desired results, at least this time they will be publicly visible.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Strong recovery at Navistar
surprises Wall St

<TEXT>
Navistar International, the Chicago-based truck and diesel engine
manufacturer, posted a turnround to income of Dollars 22m or 28 cents a
share for the fourth quarter. The extent of the improvement surprised Wall
Street, which had pushed Navistar's stock down in anticipation of a weak
earnings report.
The gain reverses a Dollars 30m or Dollars 1.46 per share loss in the fourth
quarter of 1992, when the company took a charge of Dollars 23m for a vehicle
recall.
Sales for the quarter were up 14 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn, boosted by an 18
per cent gain in shipments of mid-range diesel engines and a 13 per cent
increase in shipments of medium and heavy trucks in North America.
A year ago, Navistar recorded fourth quarter sales of Dollars 1.1bn.
For the year ended October 30, Navistar reported a net loss of Dollars 501m
or Dollars 15.19 per share. The loss includes a previously announced Dollars
513m contribution to an employee benefits programme, established in the
third quarter to alleviate Navistar's long-term pension and health-care
obliga-tions.
In the fiscal year 1992, Navistar suffered a loss of Dollars 212m, or
Dollars 9.55 per share.
Excluding the special charges, Navistar reported pre-tax income of Dollars
72m for the year, compared with a loss of Dollars 145m from continuing
operations in 1992.
Navistar's sales for the year were up 21 per cent at Dollars 4.69bn, from
Dollars 3.87bn a year ago.
Mr James Cotting, Navistar's chairman, said the company anticipates moderate
growth in the North American economy. He projected 1994 North American
medium truck and school bus chassis demand to be up 11 per cent over 1993,
at 136,000 units, while heavy truck and diesel engine sales were expected to
be flat in 1994.

card business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric, is to take on
the running of Exxon's credit card business, adding an estimated 12m
cardholders to the 70m holders of 'private label' credit cards whose
accounts it already administers for other retailers.
GE Capital, which is also buying Exxon's existing credit card receivables,
will administer all aspects of the business, though the cards will continue
to bear the Exxon name.
Unlike Shell Oil, which last month sought to expand its card business by
launching a MasterCard in association with Chemical Bank, Exxon's move
suggests that it intends to keep a private label card, available for use
only in its own service stations.
Like other oil companies, Exxon has been in the credit card business a long
time, issuing its first cards in 1929. However, with the exception of Shell
Oil, the companies have been slow to move to co-branding, despite the
success of co-branded cards issued by AT&amp;T and others.
According to MasterCard, there are around 117m private-label oil company
cards in issue, generating Dollars 27bn of payments each year.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: BellSouth challenges operating
restrictions

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BellSouth, the largest of America's 'Baby Bell' regional telephone
companies, yesterday filed a legal challenge to the proposed Dollars 12bn
takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications, the wireless telephone group, by
long-distance carrier American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
However, the company indicated that its primary purpose was not to block the
McCaw deal, but to use the suit as a lever to remove certain legal
restrictions on Baby Bells' operating in the long-distance wireless market.
Its motion was filed in the US district court in Washington, DC, before
Judge Harold Greene, who presided over the 1982 anti-trust court case which
led to the spin-off from AT&amp;T of the seven local 'Baby Bell' telephone
companies.
As part of the break-up, the Baby Bells were forbidden to operate in the
long-distance market, while AT&amp;T was prevented from acquiring the stock or
assets of a Baby Bell.
BellSouth argues that the proposed McCaw takeover violates the anti-trust
settlement because McCaw owns minority interests in several cellular
properties where Baby Bells hold the majority stake. AT&amp;T dismisses this
claim.
BellSouth says it is prepared to support modifications to the anti-trust
settlement, allowing the McCaw deal to proceed, provided that in return the
Baby Bells are allowed to compete on equal terms with AT&amp;T in the wireless
market.
This would mean allowing them to send calls out of court-mandated local
areas, as well as removing restrictions which force Bell companies to offer
their wireless customers a choice of companies to handle their long-distance
cellular traffic.
'Non-Bell companies can save money by combining all of their long-distance
traffic to take advantage of volume discounts,' it said. 'This gives McCaw
an enormous competitive advantage in the wireless market.'

But the bank, which was one of the biggest lenders to failed property
developer Olympia &amp; York, said it continued to have real-estate problems.
Earnings of Canada's second-biggest financial institution totalled CDollars
730m (USDollars 547m), or CDollars 2.99 a share, in the year to October 31,
against a loss of CDollars 12m, or 59 cents per common share, a year
earlier. Last year's losses were due to the bank's exposure to O&amp;Y.
Return on assets for 1993 was 0.53 per cent, compared with 0.01 per cent.
Assets stood at CDollars 141.3bn on October 31, up from CDollars 132.2bn a
year earlier. Loan-loss provisions dipped to CDollars 920m from CDollars
1.84bn. Non-performing loans stood at CDollars 2.43bn on October 31, or 2.3
per cent of total loans, from CDollars 3.04bn, or 3 per cent.
Fourth-quarter earnings jumped to CDollars 191m, or 75 cents a share, from
CDollars 45m, or nine cents a share.
The continued difficulties in the real-estate market are reflected in the
transfer of CDollars 100m in excess loan-loss reserves from country-risk
provisions to a special provision set up last year for troubled property
loans. Real-estate provision now stands at CDollars 250m.
Mr Al Flood, chairman, said: 'While there is evidence that real estate
values in North America have stabilised, we do not expect an early
turnround.'

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Televisa wins Mexico TV network
concession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media group, has been granted a concession to 62
television stations that will enable it to extend a television network
across much of the country.
Televisa serves 90 per cent of Mexico's television audience, and takes a
similar proportion of advertising. The new network will give the company a
total of 291 television stations, about 51 per cent of the total in the
country.
The concession has caused a controversy since the beginning of the year.
Rivals complained that while the government was selling off two state-owned
television national networks in an open auction, Televisa was being given
another national network without any competition.
The concession was granted to Radiotelevisora de Mexico Norte, a subsidiary
of Televisa, after it promised to pay the Mexican government Dollars 91m.
The two state-owned television networks were sold for Dollars 646m last
July, to an investor group headed by Mr Ricardo Salinas of Grupo Elektra.
Critics say Televisa is being rewarded for its close co-operation with
Mexico's ruling party.
Televisa was not available to comment on the transaction.
The company is planning a secondary stock offering of about Dollars 900m
later this month, which will give it a full listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.
The stations will enable Televisa to turn Channel 9, a local channel, into a
network with of covering much of Mexico.
The company has three other networks, with varying degrees of national
penetration.
Televisa has 90 per cent of Mexico's television audience, and takes a
similar proportion of advertising.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Alcatel still keen to gain a
nuclear edge - Pierre Suard, the French group's chairman, talks to John
Ridding and David Buchan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid rise of Alcatel-Alsthom to its position as one of France's most
profitable companies has been based on its ability to forge industrial
alliances and acquisitions.
The merger of the telecommunications activities of Compagnie Generale
d'Electricite and ITT of the US gave birth to Alcatel in 1987. Since then,
milestones in the group's expansion have included a joint venture with GEC
of the UK in transport and energy and the acquisition in 1990 of the
telecommunications equipment operations of Fiat of Italy.
Now, Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the group, has his eyes fixed on Framatome
 -the state-controlled French nuclear reactor group with interests in
electrical components and computer services and annual sales of more than
FFr12bn (Dollars 2.04bn).
He believes the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur is preparing
to give the green light to Alcatel-Alsthom's long-held ambitions to raise
its 44 per cent stake in Framatome to a majority holding.
This is not the first approach from Alcatel-Alsthom. In 1990, the group
briefly managed to raise its stake to 52 per cent, from 40 per cent, before
the Socialist government of Mr Michel Rocard forced it to reduce its
share-holding.
For Mr Suard the logic is as clear now as it was then. 'We are present in
all areas of power generation except nuclear,' he says.
To illustrate the possible advantages of a merger he points to the case of
Daya Bay in China where GEC-Alsthom is building a conventional power station
and Framatome is developing a nuclear facility.
According to Mr Suard, negotiations would have been simpler had the deal
been struck with a single group. Framatome's electrical components and
computer services operations would also fit well with Alcatel-Alsthom.
If Mr Suard's wish is granted, Alcatel-Alsthom should see its competitive
edge further honed. It is already sharp. Confronted by the worst economic
downturn in Europe since the second world war, the group has resisted well.
Net profits, says Mr Suard, are likely to be about the same this year as the
FFr7.1bn recorded in 1992. In the three preceding years, profits increased
by about FFr1bn annually.
This resistance is partly the result of the timing of the continent's
economic cycles. 'In 1991 and 1992 the Spanish market was very bad but the
German market was strong,' says Mr Suard. The group's principal divisions -
telecommunications, transport and energy, and electrical engineering - have
also proved relatively secure.
But the outlook remains difficult. Mr Suard is not yet convinced by
government claims that the French economy has stabilised and will start to
recover from the end of the year.
'I don't see any signs of recovery which confirm the encouraging indicators
of June and July, such as a pick-up in investment activity.'
According to Mr Suard, the German market remains depressed, while government
procurement in Italy has been 'paralysed' by the wave of scandals and
corruption investigations.
The response from Alcatel-Alsthom has included a strong push in
productivity. 'We have always been careful to restructure as soon as it is
necessary,' says Mr Suard.
But this is not easy, particularly when the group is profitable.
GEC-Alsthom, for example, has recently faced a series of demonstrations as
French workers protest against planned job cuts.
In the face of depressed European markets and what Mr Suard perceives as
damaging rigidities in the continent's labour markets, Alcatel-Alsthom has
stepped up its efforts in non-European markets, in particular in east Asia.
In addition to the Daya Bay power stations, GEC-Alsthom has won orders for a
Dollars 2.4bn South Korean high speed train project and contracts across the
region for engineering projects.
East Asia accounts for about 10 per cent of sales - a proportion which could
be doubled within 10 years, according to Mr Suard.
If overseas markets have helped maintain profits, they also raise the stakes
for Alcatel-Alsthom in the transatlantic wrangling over the Uruguay round of
international trade talks.
Few companies are as European as Alcatel-Alsthom, which derives three
quarters of its sales from the continent. It has its financial base in the
Netherlands, its management base in Paris, and its biggest
telecommunications market in Germany. Any threat to free-trade between
Europe, the US and east Asia could, therefore, have damaging implications.
Mr Suard, however, is sanguine. 'We tend to manufacture where we sell,' he
argues, discounting the impact of a failure of the trade talks.
In the US, for example, the group has about 12 per cent of the market for
cables. Over the border in Mexico, however, the Nafta accord is likely to
mean higher tariffs for switching equipment imported from Belgium.
The Alcatel chairman says he is in favour of a successful conclusion of the
Uruguay round, providing it is on acceptable terms.
This response reflects anxieties about the terms of the current debate.
Chief among them are the lack of reciprocity in public procurement contracts
 -an important source of orders for Alcatel-Alsthom - and restrictions on
foreign ownership of telecommunications companies in North America.
For a precocious company like Alcatel-Alsthom, such constraints are hard to
bear.

Carrefour, the French retailing group, is to sell its 30 per cent stake in
But, the furniture retailer, to Kleinwort Benson for FFr536m (Dollars 90m).
Carrefour said yesterday that it had accepted Kleinwort Benson's offer for
its stake, which was equivalent to FFr937 per share.
Kleinwort Benson said it had placed the shares with investors in France, the
UK and the US. The placement is subject to a right to match the offer during
the next 15 days from Venturini But, a family company which holds just over
50 per cent of But.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Chrysler lifts quarterly
dividend by one third
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, the US car maker, boosted its quarterly dividend by a third in
recognition of its return to profitability this year and recent upgrades
from credit rating agencies.
The company's dividend, payable on January 15, is being raised to 20 cents a
share from 15 cents a share. This is the first increase since Chrysler
slashed the quarterly payment from 30 cents to 15 cents in the second
quarter of 1991.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, warned, though, that the company remained intent
on further reducing its pension fund deficit and building cash reserves,
suggesting a cautious approach to future dividend increases.
'We are pleased with our recent operating results and credit upgrades and
wanted to share this success with our shareholders,' said Mr Eaton.
Stronger cashflow enabled Chrysler to make contributions of Dollars 2.6bn to
its pension fund in the first nine months, helping to reduce the Dollars
3.9bn deficit reported at the end of 1992.
Lower US interest rates mean that the fund's liabilities will be revised
upwards at the end of this year, though Chrysler said the scale of the
deficit will be below last year's level.

Kmart, the second biggest US retailer, yesterday confirmed plans to sell its
PayLess drug store chain to a company controlled by Leonard Green &amp;
Partners, a Los Angeles investment firm, for more than Dollars 1bn.
The purchaser, TCH Corporation, will pay Kmart Dollars 592m in cash and
assume Dollars 170m worth of debt. The remainder will take the form of 47
per cent of TCH's equity and Dollars 100m worth of subordinated debt
securities.
Kmart said it was putting a value on the TCH equity, but preliminary
estimates suggested the transaction could result in a Dollars 100m after-tax
charge in the current financial year.
Kmart is selling the PayLess chain in line with its strategy of shedding
specialty retailing businesses to concentrate on its core discount store
operations. Last month it announced that most of its 113 Pace warehouse
clubs would be sold to Wal-Mart, and the rest of them closed.
The company has also indicated it was considering selling stakes in its
Sports Authority sporting goods stores, Borders book stores, OfficeMax
office supply stores and Builders Square home improvement stores through
initial public offerings.
TCH Corporation owns two drug store operations: Thrifty Drug Stores, with
494 drug stores in California, and Bi-Mart Corporation, a membership
discount drug and general merchandise chain with 41 stores based in Oregon.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Capital Cities' share buy-back
offer shunned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An offer by Capital Cities/ABC, the broadcasting and publishing company, to
buy back 2m of its shares has been largely shunned by shareholders other
than Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by Mr Warren Buffett.
Capital Cities, which announced a 'Dutch auction' tender offer for the
shares on November 1, said yesterday that only 1.1m shares had been
tendered, and 1m of these came from Berkshire Hathaway.
The low take-up suggests many investors expect the group's shares to be
valued at more than Dollars 630 a share, which was the upper purchase price
limit set by Capital Cities in the Dutch auction. The stock stood unchanged
at Dollars 637 1/2 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Under a Dutch auction, a company sets a range of prices at which it is
willing to buy stock and investors specify a price at which they are willing
to sell. The company then computes the lowest price at which it would be
able to buy the block of stock and pays that sum to holders who offered to
sell at or below that price.
Capital Cities noted that since fewer than 2m shares had been tendered, it
would buy all shares tendered by Berkshire Hathaway at Dollars 630 a share.
The purchase will leave Berkshire with 2m shares, or about 13 per cent of
the outstanding stock, down from 18 per cent. Mr Buffett has a seat on the
Capital Cities board.
An unusual feature of the tender was an agreement by Capital Cities that it
would accept either all or none of the 1m Berkshire Hathaway shares tendered
in the offer - a condition that could have left Mr Buffet with a 21 per cent
stake in the business.
Capital Cities decided a buy-back was the most attractive use of Dollars
1.2bn of surplus cash, since acquisitions were not available at attractive
prices.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Gyllenhammar goes down with deal
 -Christopher Brown-Humes on the fall of Volvo's controversial chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Volvo stumbles, the tremors are felt elsewhere in Swedish society,' Pehr
Gyllenhammar once wrote. Yesterday Volvo did stumble and the tremors brought
down with them the man who had led the group for the last 22 years.
Only three months ago it would have been impossible to credit. Then PG, as
he is known in Sweden, looked set to crown a glittering and controversial
career by assuming the figurehead role at the top of Renault-Volvo.
Since then a massive shareholder revolt, characterised by strong personal
criticism of Mr Gyllenhammar himself, has changed everything, so it was not
surprising that when the deal collapsed its principal architect should fall
with it.
Along with Mr Percy Barnevik, the head of Asea Brown Boveri, Mr
Gyllenhammar, 58, can claim to be Sweden's best known industrialist. But he
was never content just to be a businessman.
As the head of Scandinavia's biggest industrial group and a passionate
advocate of Swedish membership of the European Union, he relished a broader
role as both a statesman and an ambassador for his country. Sometimes it
seemed that both Volvo and Sweden were too small for his restless energy.
This energy manifested itself in a number of ways. On the one hand, he
always seemed to have some ambitious new deal on the go, despite the
setbacks he not infrequently suffered with his plans. On the other hand, he
never shied away from controversy and often seemed eager to question
long-standing Swedish taboos.
He focused the national debate on Swedish membership of the European Union
well before the country had even applied to join, and talked about the need
for free market reforms before the country became serious about adopting
them.
His success and his outspokenness provoked admiration and envy in equal
degrees. Some were infuriated by his arrogance and his domineering style.
Others were compelled by his charm. If the business community often derided
him, Swedish people were certainly won over.
His critics are only too anxious to reel off the Gyllenhammar deals that
never were. They include a plan to merge with Saab-Scania, Volvo's domestic
rival; a scheme to sell a 40 per cent holding in Volvo to the Norwegian
government in return for North Sea oil rights; and a SKr5bn co-operation
pact with Fermenta, the pharmaceuticals group.
The setbacks continued last year when a plan to take over Procordia was
rebuffed outright by the Swedish government and when two car plants which
pioneered 'humane' production techniques were forced to close down.
For PG, the deal with Renault looked ideal, enabling him to fuse his
pan-European ambitions with his role as Sweden's industrial statesman. A
fluent French speaker who holds the Legion d'Honneur, it was obvious he
would revel in the position of chairman of the supervisory board of the
combined concern.
Again, his critics say this ambition blinded him to the deficiencies in the
accord which shareholders have picked on so relentlessly in recent weeks. A
suspicion that the deal was effectively put together by just Mr Gyllenhammar
and Renault chairman Louis Schweitzer - with other Volvo board members
remaining in the dark on some aspects of it - was never far from the
surface.
This and Mr Gyllenhammar's cavalier attitude to shareholders help to explain
why criticism at times centred as much on the Volvo chief's handling of the
Renault agreement, as it did on details of the accord.
Many thought the great survivor might pull something out of the bag to save
both the Renault deal and himself, even at the last minute. It was not to
be.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Extracts from Pehr
Gyllenhammar's resignation statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For many years I have worked as assigned by the board of directors to
provide Volvo with an economically sound structure and to participate in the
establishment of a world-class automotive industry through a merger with
Renault.
Since the board's proposal for the merger is deemed not to have the support
of the shareholders, I have decided to resign from Volvo's board of
directors, effective immediately.
My special assignment from the Volvo board has been strategic. That is, to
develop a co-operation with Renault and to complete the Procordia project.
This assignment has now been carried out after four years of preparations.
The proposal to merge with Renault has been subject to a lively debate.
Discussions have been conducted with a fervour that has gone well beyond
anything that is normal for large business deals.
The Swedish maxi devaluation has created hopes that Volvo will now do well
on its own. A couple of positive quarterly reports and the prematurely
published monthly results would have changed Volvo's strategic position in
the world automotive industry?
This of course is not the case.
The alliance will not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management
who, understandably, has lost their confidence in Volvo. To dissolve the
alliance will require time, energy and will be demoralising.
To build for the long term is the base for a good industry. Our
painstakingly built relations with France and with Renault will now be
destroyed.
The critics of our merger turn their backs on Europe and the world.
This reduces the probability of a Swedish presence in Europe and for Volvo's
long-term survival.
The excitement over a temporary upturn in Volvo's share price should be seen
in the perspective of the lost opportunity for Volvo to develop in a larger
industrial structure.
The weakness of capitalism is its shortsightedness. The tendency is to
follow the law of the least resistance.
Volvo is now left with a failed merger project. With a crushed organisation
which since September this year has been built for Renault-Volvo RVA. With
an alliance which certainly has to be dismantled, and with concern and
worries which will not quickly disappear after what has happened.
Volvo is right now a wounded company and runs the risk of being uprooted
from its unique and genuine Gothenburg base, with a perspective towards the
world. Volvo is about people in a joint mission.
I have had a firm belief in Volvo's future in a merger with Renault. I have
today decided to leave the Volvo board of directors with immediate effect.

war.
Speaking as Dresdner, Germany's second biggest bank after Deutsche Bank,
unveiled operating profits up by 16.2 per cent to DM1.6bn (Dollars 932m) for
the first 10 months of 1993, Mr Sarrazin contended that banks' profitability
served to limit the extent of the crisis in the German economy.
'Now is just the right time for banks to show their strength as a frail
financial sector would push the economy as a whole deeper into crisis,' Mr
Sarrazin said
Despite sharply increased provisions against bad and doubtful debts, buoyant
securities markets seem set to ensure that German banks will enjoy another
record year this year.
Last week Commerzbank - Germany's third largest bank - reported profits up
52 per cent at the 10-month stage and next week Deutsche Bank, Germany's
biggest bank, is also likely to report a further acceleration in profits
growth.
As at other banks, the impetus for Dresdner's profits growth came from
securities trading: the contribution from the bank's own-account trading
activities more than doubled to DM536.1m after DM234.5m in the comparable
period last year.
Commission income grew by 15.9 per cent to DM2.37bn, again reflecting
buoyant currency, equity, fixed-income and derivatives markets. Net interest
income - the profit on mainstream lending business - climbed by a more
modest 6.8 per cent to DM5.11bn.
Risks provisions rose 23.8 per cent to DM1.25bn, reflecting the malaise of
the bank's corporate clients.
Mr Sarrazin said the dividend would probably be raised by DM1 to DM13. The
decision would be taken on the basis of full-year results.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Procter and Gamble buys German
tissue producer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant, is to take its first step
into the Dollars 5.5bn-a-year European market for toilet paper, kitchen
towels and paper handkerchiefs with the acquisition of VP-Schickedanz, a
leading German manufacturer of hygiene products.
The VPS brands being acquired include Bess toilet paper, Tempo paper
handkerchiefs, Camelia feminine protection pads and Certina adult
incontinence products. VPS's disposable nappy business is not included in
the sale.
The purchase is being made from VPS's parent, the privately-held Gustav und
Grete Schickedanz Holding of Furth, Germany. The purchase price is thought
to have been about DM1bn (Dollars 582m), although neither side would confirm
this.
Information about the German company is scarce: Schickedanz said that in the
year to end-January, consolidated turnover was DM1.5bn and, despite
increased European competition, the company had shown a 'sound and solid
financial performance'.
Mr Edwin Artzt, Procter &amp; Gamble's chairman and chief executive, said paper
products were the group's biggest business after detergents, but this would
be the company's first move into the tissue business outside North America.
Procter &amp; Gamble already sells disposable nappies, feminine protection pads
and adult incontinence products in Europe, and Mr Artzt said the purchase
was a good opportunity to extend that presence into tissue products.
The VPS business represents only a small part of the Schickedanz group, a
family concern with annual sales of around DM18bn in activities as various
as mail-order, retailing, beer and financial services.
The recession has forced Schickedanz, in common with many large German
groups, to focus on its 'core businesses' and the sale of VPS is an early
example of a corporate spin-off prompted by the streamlining process under
way in broad swathes of German industry. The company was advised on the sale
by Morgan Stanley.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Capital increase to cut group
net debt at Adia
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Adia, the troubled temporary employment group, yesterday held out the
prospect of breaking even next year after two years of losses.
Mr John Bowmer, chief executive, said the group's net debt had come down
from SFr1.5bn (Dollars 1bn) at the end of 1991 to SFr785m at September 30
1993 and would fall to SFr593m after a SFr200m capital increase approved at
an EGM in Lausanne yesterday.
The capital increase, the second in less than a year, was announced last
month when Adia revealed losses of SFr112.2m for the first nine months of
the year, compared with a loss of SFr219m for all of 1992.
The capital increases consist of SFr100m in new shares to be issued to a
consortium of banks which is converting its loans into equity and a SFr100m
rights issue which is being underwritten by Mr Klaus Jacobs, the chairman.
Following the increase, the group's equity would rise to SFr334m.
If shareholders take up their rights, Mr Jacobs will have a 51.04 per cent
stake in the group. If not, his stake will rise to 57.5 per cent. Adia said
it expected most shareholders would take up their rights.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, could modify
the terms of a proposed merger with Institut Merieux, following the
suspension of production of a blood product by the vaccines group, the
company said.
Pasteur Merieux Serums et Vaccins, a division of Institut Merieux, said on
Wednesday that it was suspending production of placenta albumin because of a
decision by the French health authorities to introduce extra precautions in
collecting human placentas, which are used to produce placenta albumin.
Pasteur Merieux will take a provision of about FFr100m (Dollars 16.9m) to
cover the suspension. As a result, Rhone-Poulenc, which owns 51 per cent of
Institut Merieux, will see its net profits reduced by about FFr70m this
year. It is expected to report full-year net profits about 30 per cent lower
than the FFr1.52bn of 1992.
Rhone-Poulenc, which was successfully privatised by the French government
last month, said that a decision would be taken by the middle of the month
about whether to alter the terms of an agreement to increase its stake in
Institut Merieux from 51 per cent to 100 per cent.
Under the terms of the agreement, which was announced at the beginning of
October, it was to offer minority investors 77 group shares for every five
shares in Institut Merieux. At the end of August, Institut Merieux had a
market capitalisation of FFr13.2bn.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dutch group raises forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Internationale Nederlanden Group, the big Dutch financial services group,
has raised its profit forecast for 1993 after reporting an 11 per cent
increase in net profit for the first nine months of the year.
The improvement was due mainly to continued profit growth in virtually all
areas of banking, as well as to higher results in life insurance,
particularly in the Netherlands and North America. The rise also reflects
ING's withdrawal from the volatile and loss-making field of general
re-insurance.
Group net profit rose to Fl 1.39bn (Dollars 731m) in the first nine months
of 1993 from Fl 1.25bn the year before.
ING, which had previously forecast that profits would at least match the
1992 figure, is now predicting a 'moderate increase' in profits per share.
The group's banking operations turned in a 17.7 per cent rise in pre-tax
profit, outstripping the 6.2 per cent increase reported by ING's insurance
arm. ING, created out of the 1991 merger between the Netherlands' biggest
insurance company and its third-largest bank, is the leading Dutch proponent
of 'bancassurance', the combining of insurance and banking services in one
financial services group.
ING's profits in banking rose virtually across the board, both at home and
abroad, where ING Bank is a specialist in emerging markets banking. ING
Bank's relatively new offices in eastern Europe have already started
contributing to group profits, the company said.

FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Nissan to acquire rest of
troubled Spanish offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, is to pay Pta9.38bn (Dollars 66.6m) to
buy the outstanding 29.7 per cent minority shareholding in Nissan Motor
Iberica, its Spanish subsidiary.
Nissan said Nissan Europe was offering Pta260 per share for the 36.09m
outstanding shares in NMISA. The shares last traded at Pta147 before they
were suspended on November 18 and traded at an average price of Pta205 in
the 30 days before the suspension.
The shares have plunged in the last four months from a high for the year of
Pta423 in August, as the company's losses have deepened. The share price
peaked at Pta3,312 in September 1987. Nissan said the terms of the bid had
been approved by the Spanish stock exchange commission.
Nissan Motor Iberica has run up heavy losses in the last two years, which
are forcing Nissan to undertake a radical financial restructuring in order
to comply with Spanish corporate solvency law.
Losses are expected to total around Pta40bn (Dollars 285m) in 1993, which
will wipe out around two thirds of the company's share capital, reducing it
from Pta60bn to around Pta20bn at the end of the year.

Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation yesterday announced its second
investment in Chinese container ports in 10 days.
The group is to take a controlling stake in the Yangtze river port of
Zhangjiagang. The terminal is being expanded to develop two container
berths. P&amp;O believes it will become the focus of one of the main industrial
centres of central China.
The Zhangjiagang port can handle Panamax carriers, and the leading Chinese
shipping groups already operate services to ports around Asia. The total
cost of constructing the two berths will be about Dollars 50m (Pounds
33.5m).
Last week, P&amp;O joined forces with Hong Kong's Swire Pacific to purchase 50
per cent of the container terminal at Shekou, in the Pearl River delta, for
HKDollars 615m (Pounds 54m).
The investment in Zhangjiagang is less ambitious. The terminal is situated
about five hours upstream from Shanghai and currently has container capacity
of 150,000 trailer equivalent units.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferranti International's joint administrative receivers, Mr John Talbot and
Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen, warned yesterday that some further
redundancies at the defence electronics group are inevitable.
Yesterday they held preliminary meetings with union and staff
representatives. Ferranti's workforce had already shrunk from over 22,000 to
about 3,700 in the last three years.
'Management had already identified a need for some reductions in overall
employment levels to bring production into line with anticipated 1994
business,' they explained. But no immediate decisions are being taken and
further discussions are planned.
'Our priority is to stabilise the company's trading operations,' the
receivers also said. They added that they were concentrating on restoring
trading to near-normality 'as soon as possible.' The two Arthur Andersen
partners have begun an initial investigation into the defence electronics
group's position.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Replacement side helps lift Anglian to
Pounds 12.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant demand for replacement windows helped Anglian Group, the double
glazing company, increase pre-tax profits by 19 per cent to Pounds 12.2m in
the six months to October 2.
The self-proclaimed market leader said yesterday that a strong performance
by its retail division pushed turnover up 18 per cent to Pounds 84m (Pounds
71.4m).
The division, however, has come under increasing pressure to sustain the
group following the loss of lucrative contracts with the recently privatised
Property Services Agency.
Turnover in the commercial division, which handled work for the PSA,
declined 5 per cent and accounted for just 10 per cent of the half-year
total.
In the last financial year the value of Anglian's PSA contracts was
estimated at Pounds 15m, representing about 75 per cent of the commercial
division's business.
Mr David Herman, group finance director, admitted yesterday that the
privatisation - ending three years in which Anglian had enjoyed 'favoured
status' with the PSA - was a blow for the company.
'It has increased the pressure on our retail business to make up the
shortfall. If we get any work from the PSA's successors it will be a bonus,'
he said.
To shore up its commercial division, Anglian has pursued new local authority
contracts. The move follows its Pounds 8.5m acquisition in March this year
of New England Windows, which already supplies councils. NEW contributed
Pounds 6.97m to turnover, but margins on public sector work are expected to
shrink because spending cuts have forced councils to opt for low cost
products.
Mr Bill Hancock, chief executive, said the introduction of new products and
a sales drive in Scotland, north west England and the Midlands would help
the group 'continue its positive progress'.
Mr Hancock also announced he will retire next September to make way for Mr
Ron Swift, managing director of the Anglian Windows subsidiary.
Earnings per share - restated on a pro-forma basis to take account of last
year's flotation - were up from 8.5p to 9.1p and an interim dividend of 4.1p
(3.7p) is declared.
COMMENT
Anglian's shares closed 22p lower at 331p, reflecting concern at the loss of
the PSA business. However, the group's move to win local authority business
was likely to soften the blow in the long-term. The continuing strength,
meanwhile, of the retail division is expected to result in full year pre-tax
profits of Pounds 26.6m, putting the shares on a forward multiple of 16.5.
The group's ability to rely on its retail side should ensure continued
growth, although uncertainty over price cutting by competitors could depress
the share price further.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: ICL makes Pounds 100m rights to bolster
balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the computer company is raising a total of Pounds 100m through a rights
issue, underwritten by its parent, Fujitsu of Japan.
Northern Telecom of Canada, which holds 20 per cent of ICL, is not taking up
its entitlement resulting in Fujitsu's stake rising from 80 per cent to 84
per cent.
Fujitsu is subscribing for 77m new shares for Pounds 50m, giving it an
entitlement to warrants to subscribe for a further Pounds 50m of new shares
next year. It has agreed to exercise the warrants in November 1994.
It is the first time since 1982 that ICL has sought further equity and
reflects the company's pessimistic view of trading conditions for the next
two years. Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive, said the issue
was to strengthen the balance sheet as a precaution against continuing
structural upheaval in the industry.
'Against this background,' he said, 'it is more important than ever that we
approach the next few years from the strongest possible financial base.
'I may be more cautious than I need be, but I believe a number of
information technology companies are going to find themselves seriously
short of cash and that access to money will become as big a problem as
access to technology.'
The proceeds will be used to cut borrowings, giving gearing of between 20
per cent and 30 per cent against the present 50 per cent to 60 per cent.
Fujitsu took over ICL, formerly a subsidiary of STC, at the end of 1990. The
two companies have since operated at arms length, partly in preparation for
ICL's return to the London stock market, now unlikely for at least three
years. As a consequence, Fujitsu's further investment has been treated as a
formal rights issue.
ICL has proved the only consistently profitable European computer maker over
the past few years as red ink has engulfed its French, German and Italian
competitors.
Profitability has been falling, however. Last year the group recorded
pre-tax profits of Pounds 60.6m on turnover of Pounds 2.48bn. Mr Bonfield
did not see appreciably better results for the next two years.

Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation yesterday announced its second
investment in Chinese container ports in 10 days.
The group is to take a controlling stake in the Yangtze river port of
Zhangjiagang.
The terminal is being expanded to develop two container berths, and P&amp;O
believes it will become the focus of one of the main industrial centres of
central China, between the cities of Wuxi, Suzhou and Changzhou.
The Zhangjiagang port can handle Panamax carriers, and the leading Chinese
shipping groups already operate services to ports around Asia. The total
cost of constructing the two berths will be about Dollars 50m (Pounds
33.5m).
Last week, P&amp;O joined forces with Hong Kong's Swire Pacific to purchase 50
per cent of the container terminal at Shekou, in the Pearl River delta, for
HKDollars 615m (Pounds 54m).
The port will have container throughput of 1.1m TEU's.
The investment in Zhangjiagang is less ambitious.
The terminal is situated approximately five hours upstream from Shanghai and
currently has container capacity of 150,000 TEU's. However, the investment
underlines the group's determination to develop its transport-related
activities throughout China.
Mr Brian Baillie, deputy chairman of P&amp;O Asia, said that growth in
export-oriented manufacturing around Zhangjiagang was similar to that of the
Pearl River delta, which in the past decade has become one of the world's
biggest export-processing centres.
P&amp;O has bought the majority of a company which owns 51 per cent of the port,
but Mr Baillie would not reveal the amount of P&amp;O's investment.
The Chinese government has been anxious to bring in foreign expertise to
improve the efficiency of its ports.
Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison group has already taken stakes in the ports of
Zhuhai, Yantian and Shanghai, while the late Sir YK Pao's Wharf (Holdings)
has secured the deep water port of Ningbo.
Mr Baillie said P&amp;O was analysing a number of other investment opportunities
for ports along the Yangtze,and in north-eastern China.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Butte Mining cuts loss to Pounds 0.54m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Butte Mining, the UK quoted company whose main activity is prosecuting US
lawsuits - it is seeking damages of Dollars 975m (Pounds 654m) from former
managers and promoters - cut its loss for the year to June from Pounds 10.5m
to Pounds 540,000.
Losses per share narrowed from 4.5p to 0.2p. The company said the reduced
deficit resulted from the disposal of lossmaking assets and cost cutting.
The company was unable to dispose of its shareholding in VAM, a lossmaking
Australian gold producer, and a provisional liquidator was appointed in
March. The liquidator has arranged for VAM to be refloated and, if this is
completed early next year, Butte will receive about Pounds 350,000.

Tinsley Robor, the printing and packaging group, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 12,000 for the six months to September 30, against losses of Pounds
132,000. For the full year to March 1993 the group returned to the black
with Pounds 15,000.
Ongoing losses at Howards Printers, the label printing subsidiary, continued
to depress group results, Mr John Rose, chairman, said. Elsewhere trading
continued at tight margins with volumes maintained but expected growth had
not materialised.
The new specialist music industry printing plant at Uden in the Netherlands,
completed its first orders in August, Mr Rose said. Start-up costs of Pounds
206,000 were included in the results.
Most of the Pounds 1.9m capital expenditure during the period related to the
Uden plant. Spending in the second half would be much reduced, he said.
Turnover grew from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 13.1m. Losses per share were cut
to 0.2p (0.4p).

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Micro Focus shares fall 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based computer software house, closed
16 per cent down at Pounds 10.58p on a warning that profits were unlikely to
match revenue growth in the second half of the current year.
In February the shares touched a peak of Pounds 30, but have since been
declining.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman and chief executive, attributed the profits
slowdown to three factors. First, customers were confused by the plethora of
new technologies available. The increased time being taken on spending
decisions was causing a temporary slowdown in the growth of spending on
Micro Focus products.
Second, the large computer manufacturers, who had been buying the company's
software tools in substantial quantities to market with their hardware, had
seen their own businesses decline and this had adversely affected Micro
Focus sales.
Third, a new and advanced software product, PL/1, was still in the later
stages of customer acceptance testing and was due for first deliveries in
late-December. It would make little difference to turnover in the current
year.
Mr O'Grady concluded: 'This means that I foresee some revenue growth in the
current fiscal half year, but it will be difficult to achieve sequential
earnings growth in dollars compared with the first half.'
In the first half to July 31, pre-tax profits grew by 20 per cent to Pounds
11.6m on sales of Pounds 40m. In dollar terms, however, pre-tax profits fell
from Dollars 17.6m to Dollars 17.4m.
Micro Focus develops software tools that make it possible for companies to
develop large software systems on personal computers.
The company's shares fell sharply in August after a US analyst issued a sell
note - some 20 per cent of Micro Focus stock is held as ADRs, so US
investment sentiment has a powerful effect on the company's share price.
Yesterday analysts said they were confused by the company's explanations for
the projected slow-down; US analysts were especially strident. Their UK
colleagues have cut their full-year earnings projection from between Pounds
27m and Pounds 30m to between Pounds 22m and Pounds 23m.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hays to pull out of insurance broking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYS, the business services group, has decided to transfer its in-house
insurance business to Alexander &amp; Alexander, the international brokers based
in the US.
The group has consequently agreed to sell its St Olaf insurance broking
business to a management buy-out. St Olaf will continue with its non-Hays
clients, which comprise a substantial minority of its current business.
Hays said this move would produce ongoing annual savings of more than Pounds
600,000. The changes will result in some 20 redundancies, about half the St
Olaf staff, although some may be re-employed by Alexander &amp; Alexander.
Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of Hays, said: 'Hays does not view
insurance broking as a long-term activity, and as the group becomes
increasingly international, it requires an international rather than a UK
broker to service its insurance needs fully and cost-effectively.
The move would allow St Olaf's management to devote their time to servicing
their portfolio of clients.

<TEXT>
Baring Investment Management is attempting to raise between Dollars 40m and
Dollars 120m (Pounds 80.5m) for a new investment trust which will invest in
southern and eastern Europe.
The Baring Emerging Europe Trust will concentrate on Greece, Portugal and
Turkey in the Mediterranean region and on Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic in eastern Europe.
The managers argue that political changes, low labour costs, the potential
for faster economic, and therefore corporate earnings, growth make emerging
Europe an attractive investment opportunity.
Warburg Securities is arranging the offer which will consist of ordinary
shares with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Shareholders will have the
right to wind up the trust after 10 years.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Scapa hits Pounds 22m and buys French tape
maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scapa Group, the industrial materials group which mainly supplies the paper
industry, yesterday announced a European acquisition, a second enhanced
scrip dividend and an 11 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 22.2m.
The group is buying Barnier, a French specialist tape manufacturer, from the
Borden Group in a deal worth Pounds 20m. The Blackburn-based company said
this developed its strategy of building a substantial international business
in specialist tapes.
Barnier, which exports a third of its products, last year made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2m on sales of Pounds 25m. Scapa, which entered the
speciality tapes market in 1986, has since made acquisitions in the UK,
France and Italy.
The Barnier acquisition will be funded from Scapa's existing cash resources.
Barnier, founded in 1917, employs 260 people and has two manufacturing bases
in Valence, France, with further sales and distribution operations in
Dusseldorf and Barcelona.
Mr Harry Tuley, Scapa's chairman, said: 'Annual turnover from our specialist
tapes businesses will now be in excess of Pounds 70m, making us one of the
largest manufacturers of specialist adhesive tapes in Europe.'
Group sales for the six months to September 30 rose by 19 per cent to Pounds
187.2m. Scapa said only five percentage points of that was organic growth,
the rest coming from acquisitions and the effect of foreign currency
translation.
Earnings per share increased to 6.1p (5.7p) and the interim dividend is
lifted from 1.6p to 1.65p. Scapa is again offering an enhanced scrip worth
2.475p, an increase of 50 per cent over the cash dividend. BZW is offering a
cash alternative worth at least 2.426p, worth 98 per cent of the enhanced
scrip.
Mr Tuley said Scapa had made a second enhanced scrip issue because the group
could still profitably employ the cash saved in the business, but the board
would not seek to renew the authority for issuing enhanced scrip dividends
next year.
The chairman said the results demonstrated Scapa's resilience against a
background of continuing economic recession in its main markets, and the
group had increased market share. The extended recession had been coupled
with continuing problems of over-capacity in the paper industry in both
western Europe and the US.
Scapa is about to open a new plant for engineered fabrics in Malaysia, the
group's first factory in its rapidly growing markets of south-east Asia.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pricing of 160p puts Pounds 50.7m tag on
Telspec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Telspec, the elect-ronic telecommunications equipment manufacturer
which is coming to market through a placing with institutional investors,
were priced at 160p yesterday, valuing the Rochester-based group at Pounds
50.7m.
The group designs and manufactures advanced equipment which enables its
customers such as British Telecommunications, Telecom Australia and Deutsche
Telekom, to improve the efficiency of their networks and reduces the cost of
installing, expanding or extending local telephone services.
Telspec said it expected pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 3.3m in the year
to December 31.
Last year it made profits of Pounds 3.36m before tax on sales of Pounds
18.2m.
The flotation price represents a multiple of 20.1 times forecast earnings
per share for the current year; the notional gross dividend yield is 2 per
cent.
The 12.65m share placing was completed by Credit Lyonnais Laing and will
raise about Pounds 20.2m, including Pounds 5m net of expenses, which will be
used to fund increased capital expenditure and expand overseas service and
support facilities.
Mr Frank Hackett-Jones, Telspec's founder and chairman, retains a 60.1 per
cent interest in the group.
He said the company had just won a Pounds 7m order for advanced digital
telecommunications equipment from Deutsche Telekom.

Losses for the 12 months to the end of September at Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the
financially troubled ITV company, are likely to be higher than expected.
Last month the company issued a formal statement saying that a deficit was
likely for the year.
All the signs were that the expected loss, mainly caused by controversial
methods of selling advertising such as trying to pull forward revenue by
heavy discounting, could be contained at a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 5m.
It is believed that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees has now decided not to include a
discount on its subscription to the national ITV network in the 1992-93 year
because it will not be paid until early next year.
A discount of some Pounds 3.5m is expected because of the fall in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees' share of net advertising revenue - the basis on which
network programme costs are allocated.
As a result pre-tax losses of the company, in which Pearson, owners of the
Financial Times, has a stake, are likely to be in the region of Pounds 8.5m.
There is,however, a realistic possibility of a return to profit in the
current financial year.
Despite its problems Yorkshire is being examined by a number of possible
predators, including LWT which already owns 14 per cent.
Any purchase by another ITV company, however, would require the immediate
disposal of Tyne Tees because under proposed new government rules an ITV
company, outside London, can hold two broadcasting licences but no more.
The new rules, due to come into effect on January 1, will be debated in the
House of Commons next Wednesday and by the House of Lords on December 13.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Growth in advertising boosts Metro Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing interest in radio as an advertising medium and signs of returning
consumer confidence helped Metro Radio Group, the USM-quoted radio station
operator, increase pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 2.36m in the
year to September 30, against Pounds 1.86m .
The group operates seven independent radio stations in north-east England
and Yorkshire.
Advertising revenue rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 12.6m).
Local and regional revenue was 23 per cent higher. A strong recovery in the
second half resulted in a national revenue increase of 1.9 per cent.
Turnover rose to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 15.2m). Net debt dropped 38 per cent
to Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 2.36m).
Earnings per share rose by 25 per cent to 9.4p (7.5p) and the total dividend
goes up 10 per cent to 5.5p (5p) via a final of 4p.
Mr John Josephs, managing director, said the increase in advertising demand
had been across the board,but growth areas had been motor manufacturers and
dealers and retailers of furniture and white goods.
The arrival in the marketplace of Classic FM and Virgin had raised radio
advertising's profile, he said.
Mr Neil Robinson, chairman, said the group had made an excellent start to
the new financial year, with advertising revenue well ahead.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Heywood shares leap after bullish forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Heywood Williams, the building materials group, rose sharply
yesterday after it forecast a sixfold rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 34m
for the year to December 31, against Pounds 5.5m.
The bullish forecast was announced along with plans to buy Bristol Products,
a US plumbing components manufacturer and distributor, for Dollars 81.2m
(Pounds 54.9m), including the repayment of borrowings.
The acquisition, complementing the group's purchase of US building group
LaSalle-Deitch earlier this year, will be funded by a 1-for-4 rights issue
to raise Pounds 50.6m.
Strong growth in existing businesses was forecast to push earnings per share
ahead to 14.8p (1.7p).
The shares rose 43p to 387p following the announcement, before closing at
384p.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, Heywood's chairman, said Bristol would help the group
develop its niche business in the US, where LaSalle distributes building
products to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries.
Bristol was a rival bidder for LaSalle, and the Indiana-based company
approached Heywood after it failed.
Bristol's management, which is forecasting profits of Dollars 12.5m in the
year to November 30, will be kept in place.
COMMENT
Heywood Williams has seen a marked improvement in its share price since it
sold most of its glass business to Pilkington earlier this year. Since then
it has turned its back on the construction industry and concentrated on auto
glass sales in the UK and the growing manufactured housing and recreation
vehicle market in the US. Future acquisitions are now likely in the UK,
where it wants to keep at least 40 per cent of its business. If the rights
issue is fully taken up, it will certainly be in a position to do so with
cash balances of up to Pounds 10m and shareholders' funds of Pounds 120m.
Following yesterday's announcement, brokers upgraded pre-tax profits
forecasts for 1994 by Pounds 11m to Pounds 39m, putting the shares on a
multiple ratio of 16. The positive sentiment and upgrading appears to make
Heywood a good long-term buy.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Severn Trent held back by decline in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn Trent, the privatised water utility, yesterday announced interim
pre-tax profits of Pounds 146.9m, held back by a decline in demand from
commercial and industrial customers and higher interest charges.
Pre-tax profits were 4.3 per cent higher than last year's reported Pounds
140.8m. However, on a comparable basis following accounting changes last
year, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 148.3m.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 rose by 6.7 per cent to Pounds
489.8m. Interest charges were more than doubled at Pounds 23.2m (Pounds
11m).
Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, said the results reflected 'tight cost
controls in the business'.
Direct operating costs, excluding East Worcester Water, the recently
acquired supplier, were 1.3 per cent lower in the first half.
Mr Paul said Biffa, the waste management company acquired for Pounds 212m in
1991, had contributed operating profits 10 per cent higher at Pounds 6.6m.
Turnover was 15 per cent up at Pounds 58.1m. Biffa was, however, still some
way from covering interim interest costs of about Pounds 12m.
The other non-regulated businesses declined at the operating level from
Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 600,000. Mr Paul said this was largely due to Pounds
1.2m in marketing costs for the international operation.
The core UK regulated water business benefited from cost cutting and
production efficiencies, contributing a 12 per cent rise in operating
profits to Pounds 167m. Sales were 5 per cent up at Pounds 394.1m.
Severn suffered an 8 per cent fall in consumption by its top 1,500
commercial customers.
Capital expenditure of Pounds 470m was budgeted this year, down from Pounds
550m, with a further decline to roughly Pounds 400m next year. The interim
dividend is lifted to 7.55p (7p), payable from earnings 5 per cent higher at
39.4p.
COMMENT
The good news came where least expected at Severn Trent. Biffa, long the
focus of unhappy controversy over the price paid and onerous financing
commitments, appears to have more than held its own; at least, compared with
Shanks &amp; McEwan. Still, cynics argue any contribution after financing costs
could be up to a decade away. The decline in operating costs was expected,
but could work against Severn in the price review next year. There is a
possibility that Ofwat will squeeze the efficient Severn harder to allow
others with greater commitments leeway. Given such uncertainties, Severn
appears fully valued. Full-year forecasts are for Pounds 275m pre-tax, with
a dividend of 22.8p.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hanson shares tumble 15 3/4p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hanson tumbled 15 3/4p to 268 1/2p yesterday as investors took to
heart the cautious tone of the statement - including a warning there could
be Pounds 275m negative swing in interest costs in 1994 - and the lack of a
dividend increase.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said the holding of the dividend had been
a particularly difficult decision, and he thought it the first time in the
group's 30 year history that it had not been increased when final results
were announced.
He admitted being conscious that Hanson was a yield stock, but said with
dividend cover at 1.3 times, the earnings outlook dull in the short term,
and the Peabody coal strike still unresolved, Hanson had felt unable to
increase the dividend.
However, he said the issue would be under constant review, and hoped that as
trading turned up, and subject to the outlook for 1995, an increase might be
forthcoming later in 1994. Hanson pays dividends quarterly.
He doubted whether the Foreign Income Dividend scheme, detailed in the
Budget, would be beneficial to Hanson. 'We must satisfy all our
shareholders. FIDs are a massive turn-off for tax exempt investors.'
Mr Bill Landuyt, finance director, said the corporation tax provisions in
the Budget would have little effect on Hanson, and the group would 'look for
every legal way to reduce tax'. The 11p increase in duty on 20 cigarettes
would be harmful to volumes at Imperial Tobacco, while cuts in the road
building programme would affect ARC.
Group turnover in the year to September 30 was Pounds 9.76bn (Pounds 8.8bn)
and operating profits fell from Pounds 1.07bn to Pounds 978m, affected by
the Pounds 125m cost of the US coal strike but a Pounds 87m benefit from
exchange rate moves. Exceptionals, profits on disposals less closure costs,
added Pounds 24m (Pounds 172m).
Lower rates cut net interest income from Pounds 46m to Pounds 14m, leaving
pre-tax profits at Pounds 1.02bn (Pounds 1.29bn). The fall in UK interest
rates, the lack of high yielding long-term deposits fixed in 1992 and higher
borrowings due to acquisitions, could add Pounds 275m to interest charges in
1994.
Earnings, excluding exceptionals, were 14.1p (18.5p).
A fall in operating profits from industrial activities to Pounds 291m
(Pounds 393m) was not quite offset by a rise from Pounds 390m to Pounds 443m
in consumer products and from Pounds 257m to Pounds 301m in building
products.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kingfisher takes stake in German office
supplier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher, the retailing group, is buying a 33 per cent stake in
Maxi-Papier-Markt, the German office superstore group for DM20m (Pounds
7.9m). The purchase follows its move into France through the takeover
earlier this year of Darty, the electrical retailer.
The agreement also involves Staples, the US office superstore chain
investing a further DM20m in Maxi-Papier, which was founded in 1989 and
operates 11 office discount stores in Germany, lifting its holding to 49 per
cent.
Kingfisher and Staples formed a joint venture last year to develop office
superstores in the UK.
Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of Kingfisher, which also owns the B&amp;Q,
Comet, Woolworths and Superdrug chains, said its entry into the German
market was a direct result of its relationship with Staples.
'Staples' and Maxi-Papier's expertise in the office supplies industry
combined with our own retail experience will enable us to expand and grow
this business,' he added.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: All-round advance lifts Leeds 31% to Pounds
7.23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leeds Group, the West Yorkshire-based textile dyer and printer, increased
pre-tax profits by 31 per cent from Pounds 5.53m to Pounds 7.23m over the
year to September 30.
The group is proposing to lift the annual dividend by 16 per cent and make a
1-for-2 scrip issue.
Mr Robert Wade, chairman, said that the dividend rise - up to 8.5p (7.33p
adjusted for last year's scrip) via a 5.75p final - was the 27th consecutive
annual increase for the group.
Turnover expanded 14 per cent to Pounds 47.1m (Pounds 41.3m), though Mr Wade
pointed out that a 30 per cent fall in wool prices for the second year
running and the reduction in output at the Walsden factory hid an increase
in volumes of about 15 per cent.
The fire at Walsden made its way on to the profit and loss account via
credits of Pounds 572,000 and Pounds 286,000 for business interruption
insurance and material damage insurance respectively.
Mr Wade said the group was having to look for future profits not from price
increases, but rather cost cutting, higher volumes and other such measures.
He said that about 30 per cent of the group's output went abroad, though the
Japanese and European markets remained depressed. The Middle East was 'quite
good, though not as good as last time', but new markets, such as Taiwan,
South Korea, Thailand and Singapore, were doing well.
'All divisions of the group contributed to the increased profit,' said Mr
Wade, with the two Dutch companies acquired in April for an initial Pounds
2.49m contributing Pounds 553,000, and the leasing side, often thought
anomalous, making Pounds 356,000 (Pounds 286,000).
Earnings per share, including the material damage insurance, emerged at
28.5p and excluding it at 26.9p, against 22.1p last time.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Royal Doulton ends first day 14p up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer demerged from media
parent Pearson, ended the first day of trading 14p higher than the opening
quoted price of 193p, valuing the company at Pounds 113.8m.
A group of three UK institutions is believed to have led the buying as media
investors sought to shed the shares. The institutions are also thought to be
existing Pearson investors.
A total of 23.9m shares were traded, the second largest volume after Hanson.
Pearson shareholders were offered one Royal Doulton share for every 10 held
in the parent, which owns the Financial Times.
Pearson shares closed Wednesday at 614p. They opened at 594p, reflecting the
demerger of Royal Doulton, but gained 3p during the day to close at 597p.
Analysts said buyers of Royal Doulton shares were focusing on the
longer-term.
The company has made it clear that the current year will be depressed by
redundancy and restructuring costs. It reported a Pounds 2.1m loss for the
six months to June 26 and a profit of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 15.5m) for 1992.
There were no comparable first-half figures for 1992.
The forecasts for next year range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 17m.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Compass moves onto a new heading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Compass, the catering group that already has links with Pizza Hut and Burger
King, yesterday added the name of Roux to the menu, writes David Blackwell.
The group has paid about Pounds 900,000 for the 11 catering contracts
managed by the Roux brothers. It will launch a special executive service to
be known as Roux Fine Dining.
Mr Albert Roux described it as 'a perfect marriage.' The Roux business would
benefit from the experience, wide customer base and financial expertise of
Compass. Both Albert and Michel Roux will be involved in the business.
Mr Francis Mackay, Compass chief executive, said the link would complete the
jigsaw of businesses that would enable his group to cater from schools to
boardroom level.
Last May Compass reported interim pre-tax profits up from Pounds 17m to
Pounds 18.2m on sales ahead by 19 per cent at Pounds 209.4m.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker approaches vital Hill deadline
amid acrimony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brent Walker is rapidly approaching a vital deadline in its efforts to sell
or refinance William Hill, its betting shop business. A decision is required
on Monday.
Discussions are understood to have become fraught, with accusations flying
and banks complaining of strong-arm tactics.
Advisers believe that if the flotation course is to be pursued, a decision
must be made early next week. This is so that a marketing campaign can begin
in time to manage a successful float by the March 1 deadline for the
repayment of William Hill's debt.
Lenders to William Hill are only concerned with getting their loans repaid
on time. This can be achieved either through a flotation, a sale to a group
of venture capitalists which has put in an offer, or by the Brent Walker
banks taking on the William Hill debt.
Standard Chartered and Lloyds Bank, lead banks to Brent Walker, appear
determined to adopt the latter course, refinancing Hill's Pounds 330m of
secured and Pounds 40m of unsecured debt, which is ring-fenced from Brent
Walker.
They prefer that route since they believe that William Hill's true value
could be higher than the expected Pounds 500m flotation proceeds.
Furthermore, the Brent Walker refinancing completed last year was predicated
on the retention of two cash generating businesses - the pubs chain and
William Hill. Without William Hill, the prospects for Brent Walker's banks
being repaid eventually would seem dimmer.
Standard Chartered and Lloyds could block a flotation, since the consent of
the Brent Walker banks is needed for a sale of William Hill.
But refinancing attempts have so far failed, with deadlines being missed and
extended. Standard Chartered and Lloyds are said to have found takers for
only Pounds 270m of the William Hill debt. Even large lenders to Brent
Walker, such as Credit Suisse, are understood to be unwilling to participate
in the refinancing.
That leaves the venture capital offer, which exceeds Pounds 450m. This could
provide a way out for Brent Walker, as the offer could repay the William
Hill debt and allow the company to retain an equity stake in the betting
business.
However, bankers fear that if the flotation option fades and the refinancing
fails, the value of the venture capital offer could recede, leaving little
for Brent Walker after repaying the William Hill banks.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Racal shares fall after provisions lead to
Pounds 0.4m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Racal Electronics fell sharply yesterday after the data
communications, radio and network services group reported a small interim
pre-tax loss, mainly reflecting Pounds 20.2m in provisions for disposal and
closure costs on the Racal-Redac computer aided engineering business.
The shares closed 29p lower at 160p after the group announced a Pounds
388,000 pre-tax loss for the 28 weeks to October 8, compared with a Pounds
23.2m profit.
The results were the first to be reported under the new FRS 3 accounting
rules.
Losses per share amounted to 0.07p compared with earnings of 3.95p. . The
interim dividend, however, is maintained at 1.5p.
Turnover from continuing operations slipped by 3.9 per cent to Pounds 428.7m
(Pounds 446m) while discontinued operations added a further Pounds 1.26m
(Pounds 2.77m).
Operating profits from continuing operations declined by 3.5 per cent to
Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 23.9m) after charging Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 7.7m) in
redundancy, severance and reorganisation costs.
Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman, said the operating results were adversely
affected by lower turnover in the radio communications business resulting in
a Pounds 4.5m reduction in profit. The decline in turnover reflected the
continued worldwide recession, government defence spending cutbacks and
increased competition.
Operating profits from the data communications and marine and energy
businesses also fell, but were higher in the defence radar and avionics and
specialised businesses.
Aside from the the Racal-Redac activities which were sold or closed in
October, discontinued activities also included the HRM Marine activities in
Spain which were discontinued in the summer of 1992.
Operating losses for these businesses totalled Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 5.02m).
This, together with the Racal-Redac disposal and closure costs of Pounds
6.3m and the acquisition goodwill of these businesses, written off in
previous years, of Pounds 13.9m, produced a loss of Pounds 25.1m (Pounds
5.02m) on discontinued operations and resulted in a Pounds 1.88m trading
loss compared with Pounds 18.9m profits. Interest income fell to Pounds 1.5m
(Pounds 4.29m).
A cash-outflow of Pounds 23.6m, mainly reflecting a Pounds 34.7m increase in
working capital, meant the group ended the period with net borrowings of
Pounds 54.9m and gearing of 10.4 per cent. Sir Ernest said improved
performances were expected in the second half from the data and radio
communications businesses.
However, he warned that given the need for increased expenditure on the
British Army Bowman communications project and the National Lottery bid,
operating profits from continuing operations for the full year would be
similar to last year.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Forte to retain Harvester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte has taken its Harvester restaurant chain off the market after failing
to find a buyer prepared to pay the price it was asking.
Forte was hoping for a price of more than Pounds 120m for the 78 Harvester
restaurants. It is believed that the highest price offered was Pounds 110m.
Among the potential buyers believed to have expressed an interest in the
chain were Whitbread and Allied-Lyons.
Forte said it would now invest in the chain. Sales are currently believed to
be almost 10 per cent up on last year.
The group also said it had completed the sale of its 50 per cent stake in
the UK chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken to Pepsico for Pounds 40m cash.

FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: MEPC shares hit by fall in net asset value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company which completed a Pounds 222m
rights issue earlier this year, yesterday announced a fall of almost 15 per
cent in pre-tax profits from Pounds 95.2m to Pounds 81m for the year to
end-September.
The latest figure was struck after exceptional items of Pounds 13.2m,
including a Pounds 10m provision on interest rate hedging, compared with
Pounds 14.2m last time.
Earnings fell from 18.9p to 15.5p. Nevertheless, the group proposed a final
dividend of 14.75p, giving an unchanged total for the year of 20p.
Net asset value per share fell from 445p to 416p.
The shares closed 27p lower at 523p.
Lord Blakenham, chairman, said the net asset values did not reflect the
scale of the upturn in the market since they were prepared in August. 'We
believe we have seen the turning point in the UK property market,' he said,
citing much increased investor interest.
The company was in a far stronger position than a year ago, he said. After
property sales of Pounds 225m, a Pounds 150m preferred share issue and the
rights issue, gearing had fallen from 82 per cent to 48 per cent. The group
had cash of Pounds 211m (Pounds 89m).
After an external valuation, the group's overall valuation write-down was
1.1 per cent, while the investment properties rose in value by 3.1 per cent.
The group said 'substantial write-downs' had been incurred at Alban Gate in
the City and at a Tunbridge Wells shopping centre.
Mr James Tuckey, chief executive, said the group was very pleased with the
progress made on void properties, which were down to less than 5 per cent
compared with 8 per cent a year ago and 18 per cent two years ago.
Last month the group announced the proposed acquisition for Pounds 115m of
American Property Trust, a unit trust controlled by UK pension funds that
owns two shopping malls in Los Angeles and Atlanta. Completion of the deal
will lift the proportion of retail property in the MEPC portfolio from 27.5
per cent to 32.3 per cent, and reduce offices from 61.4 per cent to 57.3 per
cent.
COMMENT
The City was taken aback by the sharp fall in net asset values, which ended
well below the bottom of the expected 435p to 485p range. No figure was
given for the write-down on Alban Gate and Tunbridge Wells, but it appears
to be on the way to Pounds 100m. While it is worth noting that the
valuations were made last August, and the property market has shown signs of
recovery since, this is still an embarrassing figure. The dividend, which
remains uncovered, is the prop for the stock. Even if the recovery leads to
a rise in net asset values to over 500p next time, the shares are still at a
premium - and there is no prospect of dividend growth.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Back seat drivers push Volvo off the road: Shareholders
unhappy with Renault deal but offer few alternatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resignation last night of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's dominant figure
for more than two decades, was the culmination of one of the most
extraordinary episodes in Swedish industrial history.
When Volvo announced its proposed merger with Renault in September, it was
billed as Mr Gyllenhammar's crowning achievement, but instead it turned out
to be the beginning of his humiliation.
In a battle with his shareholders, Mr Gyllenhammar saw the merger torn up, a
three-year alliance with Renault thrown into doubt and questions raised
about the strategy of Volvo.
Mr Gyllenhammar hit back hard at his enemies last night, accusing them of
wilfully blurring debate over the merits of the merger with emotional and
political issues. In a bitter commment, he said Volvo shareholders had
simply followed popular sentiment.
'Many have let me know that they are very observant of where the wind
blows,' he said. But the shareholder revolt was bred by longstanding
disquiet over Mr Gyllenhammar's dictatorial management style which spilled
over into outright hostility at what was seen as his bungled negotiation of
a deeply flawed agreement with Renault.
For shareholders, the core question of exactly how much Renault was paying
to take over Volvo's vehicle manufacturing was never properly answered. In
spite of publishing sheaves of information, the two groups never explained
how they had calculated the 35 per cent share of the merged company that
Volvo was to receive.
The lack of detailed valuations exacerbated strong Swedish doubts over
placing Volvo's core assets into an unquoted company controlled by what was
regarded as one of Europe's most interventionist states.
Latterly, concern was also fuelled by growing reports from groups within
Volvo - such as engineers - that co-operation between Renault and Volvo
under the existing alliance had not gone as smoothly as Mr Gyllenhammar had
suggested.
Pushed along by saturation media coverage, much of it hostile to the deal,
these factors helped overturn a mood of the sober acceptance by politicians,
unions, the business community and shareholders that had greeted the merger
announcement in September.
As the doubts piled up, the latent emotional reluctance to seeing the
greatest symbol of Swedish industrial prowess fall under foreign control
came to the fore.
But the question Volvo's shareholders have not addressed is where the
company goes if not to a merger with Renault. 'Whatever happens, it will be
bad for Volvo,' admitted Mr Stig Ramel, chief executive of the 92-94 Fund, a
state investment fund which was in the 'no' camp to the merger. 'It is a
question of finding the way out that is least damaging.'
The central aspect of the merger proposal which Volvo always felt commanded
widespread support was the 'industrial logic' of the deal - the belief that
Volvo needed to deepen the partnership already established with Renault if
it was to survive in a world automotive industry saddled with overcapacity.
Critics argued that the rapid return to profitability at Volvo this year -
in contrast to sagging profits at Renault - showed the company could stand
alone. They pointed out Volvo's truck division was much stronger than
Renault's. Moreover, they said Renault, which already owns 10 per cent of
Volvo, was unlikely to try to reverse out of the alliance which benefits
both companies, especially in cost savings.
Those who rejected the merger are apparently willing to contribute, via a
share issue, to the SKr8bn (Pounds 640m) Volvo has said it will need in new
capital without the merger. But Mr Gyllenhammar derided the notion that
Volvo suddenly had a 'brilliant future' without Renault.
'Our painstakingly built relations with France and with Renault will now be
detroyed with immediate effect. This reduces the probability of a Swedish
presence in Europe and for Volvo's long-term survival.' This argument has
always been accepted by Volvo's blue-collar trade unions - something Mr
Gyllenhammar paid tribute to in a further swipe at his critics.
'(The unions) see the long term. They understand industrial development. And
they have courage.' Mr Gyllenhammar stressed the weaknesses at Volvo which
the merger was meant to address.
Strong profits flow this year has been helped by a weak Swedish krona and
low development costs, as new models have been recently launched. In the
meantime, Volvo's narrow model range - it does not produce a small car - is
a severe hindrance.
The market-leading safety record which powered Volvo's success in the 1980s
has also been eroded by advances made by other manufacturers. 'Volvo needs a
partner, now or later, and later there won't be such a good deal available,'
said one of Volvo's international advisers.
Much will now depend on Renault's response to the crisis at Volvo. Within
Volvo itself, meanwhile, it was clear last night that the Volvo board will
be almost completely reshaped, with Mr Gyllenhammar's allies, including Mr
Raymond Levy, the former Renault chief, stepping down with him. Mr Soren
Gyll, brought in as chief executive by Mr Gyllenhammar last year, is now set
to exert full influence over Volvo.
He has retained shareholder support throughout the merger episode and will
be the key figure in shaping Volvo's uncertain future.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Germany to issue long bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany responded to demands from the international investment community
yesterday when it announced plans for the issue of bonds with a maturity of
more than 10 years for the first time in nearly eight years.
The Bundesbank, the German government's issuing agent, said that next
Wednesday the government would sell a new tranche of its 6 per cent bond
issue due 2016. The bonds were launched in May 1986.
A senior official at the finance ministry in Bonn said that if next week's
auction was a success, the government would consider issuing more long-dated
bonds, including a 30-year issue. Traders expect the auction to raise DM3bn
to DM4bn.
German banks have recently begun to push hard for a new 30-year bund to
bring the German market into line with leading bond markets elsewhere. Most
German government bond issuance is concentrated in the five and 10-year
areas of the yield curve, while government bond markets in the US, the UK,
the Netherlands and France have liquid, long-dated sectors, with maturities
as long as 30 years.
Italy has become the latest European sovereign borrower to issue 30-year
bonds and Spain will make its first issue of 15-year bonds in the domestic
market this month.
Two weeks ago, a DM2bn offering of 30-year Eurobonds by the Austrian
government was snapped up by international investors starved of long-dated
bonds denominated in D-Marks. It prompted a flood of long-dated D-Mark bond
issues by German federal states.
The German finance ministry said the government was keen to raise long-term
financing at the current low level of interest rates. Bankers said that it
was in the German government's interest to satisfy the demands of
international investors since their continued support was central to the
government's success in funding its massive borrowing requirement. Next
year, net public sector borrowing is expected to total around DM230bn,
marginally below this year's DM235bn (Pounds 93bn).

FT  03 DEC 93 / Royal Bank of Scotland surges to Pounds 265m for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday reported transformed pre-tax profits of
Pounds 265.2m, up from 12.6m, helped by a 26 per cent fall in bad debt
provisions, a recovery from losses in branch banking and a sharp rise in
income from foreign exchange and derivatives.
Its shares rose 33p to 428p yesterday, completing a 21 per cent advance
since the Pounds 50.2m pre-tax profits of its Direct Line insurance
subsidiary were announced last week.
The results for the year to September 30 raised expectations that other
clearing banks will report much improved profits for the year as income is
boosted by trading activities, and charges for bad and doubtful debts are
cut.
Royal Bank raised its total dividend 25 per cent to 11p, against 8.8p. Mr
George Mathewson, chief executive, said it had reduced the volatility of its
earnings and could now 'deliver a stable and growing dividend stream'.
Earnings per share increased from 0.7p to 17.7p and the dividend was covered
1.6 times, against 0.1 times. It kept a strong 6.9 per cent ratio of tier 1
capital to risk-weighted assets in spite of raising assets to Pounds 36.3bn,
against Pounds 34.6bn.
Total income rose 17 per cent to Pounds 1.43bn, while expenses rose 10 per
cent to Pounds 837.2m, against Pounds 764.3m. Bad debt provisions fell from
Pounds 396.2m to Pounds 293.2m, with Pounds 182.3m of the provisions falling
in the first half.
Mr Peter Wood, Direct Line chief executive, bought nearly Pounds 8m of
shares yesterday morning, raising his stake to the level agreed with Royal
Bank. The bank's UK staff will receive a 5.1 per cent profit-related pay
bonus.
The branch banking division turned from a Pounds 16.1m loss to a Pounds
69.7m profit after higher sales of mortgages and life products. The division
gained Pounds 26m from a restructuring programme which is expected to add
Pounds 200m a year to profits by 1997.
The corporate and institutional banking division increased profits 92 per
cent to Pounds 129.7m, and expanded its customer base by 20 per cent.
Related foreign exchange and derivative activities contributed Pounds
107.5m, against Pounds 63.2m.
Citizens, the US retail banking subsidiary, raised profits 84 per cent to
Pounds 36.3m, with net interest income rising 23 per cent from acquisitions
and growth. Loan loss provisions rose Pounds 4m to Pounds 19.7m because of
exchange rate movements.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Shake-up cuts profit 31% at GrandMet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, saw pre-tax
profits fall 31 per cent to Pounds 630m in the year to September after
Pounds 286m charges.
The costs include: Pounds 175m for restructuring, largely in US food and
retailing; Pounds 66m provisions for money owed by Brent Walker on the
William Hill betting shops, plus Pounds 20m to cover costs; a Pounds 50m
write-down of UK property assets.
But for the exceptionals, pre-tax profits would have been 6.6 per cent ahead
at Pounds 916m. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman, said: 'Recoveries in the US
and UK did not produce significant benefits and many European economies
remained in recession.'
Operating profits from continuing businesses rose 18.6 per cent to Pounds
958m on turnover up from Pounds 6.58bn to Pounds 7.64bn.
Profits of IDV, the drinks division, increased 14 per cent to Pounds 561m,
and by 4 per cent excluding currency effects. Total sales of wines and
spirits exceeded 100m cases for the first time. The leading brands -
Smirnoff vodka, J &amp; B Scotch whisky and Baileys liqueur - gained volume, and
Russia became the fifth biggest market for Smirnoff.
North American food operations lifted profits 29 per cent to Pounds 212m, or
by 9 per cent in local currency terms. But European food profits fell from
Pounds 22m to Pounds 15m.
Burger King's profits rose 29 per cent to Pounds 170m, also boosted by
currency moves. Another 540 stores were opened, bringing the total to 7,121.
GrandMet's share of losses at Inntrepreneur, the UK pub joint venture with
Fosters Brewing, fell from Pounds 14m to Pounds 9m. The business is expected
to break even this year, but each partner has had to inject Pounds 84.5m
into it since September to ensure compliance with financial covenants.
The group spent nearly Pounds 900m on advertising and marketing during the
year.
Sterling devaluation added Pounds 674m to net borrowings, lifting the total
to Pounds 2.8bn and gearing to 75 per cent. The sale of Chef &amp; Brewer pubs
in October is expected to reduce debt by Pounds 700m and gearing to 60 per
cent.
Earnings per share, before exceptionals, rose 4.6 per cent to 29.7p; after
the charges they fell from 30.3p to 20p. A final dividend of 8.15p lifts the
total 5.7 per cent to 13p.

FT  03 DEC 93 / BTR buys US group for Dollars 820m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the UK-based industrial conglomerate, went back on to the acquisition
trail yesterday with an agreed Dollars 820m (Pounds 550m) purchase of
Rexnord, a US industrial manufacturer based in Milwaukee.
BTR has been talking since May with Fairchild, the US supplier of aerospace
and industrial components which has a 44 per cent stake in Rexnord. The UK
group already has irrevocable commitments for more than 50 per cent of the
shares.
Rexnord makes material conveying systems, power transmission components and
industrial and aerospace seals for US and international manufacturers and
users of industrial equipment. In the year to June 30, the group made
operating profits of Dollars 83m on sales of Dollars 533m. Net earnings
before extraordinary items were Dollars 23.9m.
Rexnord employs about 4,700 people. It has 14 manufacturing sites - 11 in
the US, two in Germany and one in Italy.
Although the UK group has a fearsome reputation as a cost-cutter, Mr Alan
Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said he was more interested in increasing
Rexnord's sales by widening its market beyond the US. 'In particular, we see
great potential for substantially growing Rexnord's sales in the large Asian
markets and also in Europe.' He said the purchase would be
earnings-enhancing from year one.
If the deal goes ahead, BTR's gearing is likely to go up from 40 per cent at
the year-end to about 60 per cent. Mr Jackson said he was comfortable with
that level, not least because Rexnord was very cash generative.
BTR said Rexnord's brand names were a good fit with the group's existing
products and would expose it to a wider market. One of Rexnord's attractions
was that 50 per cent of sales were spares.
This deal is the biggest announced by BTR since it paid Pounds 1.55bn in
1991 for Hawker Siddeley, the UK aerospace and engineering group. Mr Jackson
said BTR was concentrating resources on industrial manufacturing. The policy
has recently led it to invest in Chinese bottling plants and dispose of two
wholesale distribution businesses in the UK and US.
The UK group will pay a total of Dollars 420m in cash for Rexnord and assume
borrowings of about Dollars 400m.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Japan agrees stimulus package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's government was struggling to restore public confidence yesterday as
a deepening recession plus the resignation of a cabinet minister threatened
to delay political reform beyond the year-end deadline.
The seven-party coalition agreed to launch early next week the fourth
economic stimulus package this year. It will include Y5,000bn to Y6,000bn
(Pounds 31.4bn to Pounds 37.7bn) of income and other tax cuts, a further
reduction in bureaucratic controls, lower taxes on land sales and measures
to stimulate the stock market, said officials.
Details have yet to be settled, particularly about how to fund the income
tax cut, on which the coalition is deeply split.
The move is a clear sign that government concern over the economy, which has
failed to respond to record low interest rates and a boost in public
spending, has reached a new phase.
The gross national product for the third quarter and the Bank of Japan's
quarterly review of business confidence are to be published next week and
both are expected to show deepening gloom. Today's annual report on Japan by
the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development warns that growth
prospects are not encouraging.
Recent stock market falls have reinforced the need for economic action. The
government has had to give priority to a supplementary budget, needed to
finance the previous spending package, at a time when it was hoping to be
pushing political reform.
This makes it unlikely that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, will
get parliamentary clearance by the end of the year for plans to reform the
corrupt electoral system, said officials of his Japan New Party. 'We just
don't have the time to worry about political reforms. Our immediate
attention is on the economy,' said one official.
The government lost a valuable day of parliamentary business yesterday when
Mr Keisuke Nakanishi, director general of the defence agency - the Japanese
equivalent of defence minister - created an uproar by calling for the
pacifist constitution to be revised to allow Japanese soldiers to take a
larger combat role under United Nations command. Mr Nakanishi resigned, to
be succeeded by Mr Kazuo Aichi of the Japan Renewal Party.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Major rejects Dublin peace proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp differences between London and Dublin over the shape of any
settlement for Northern Ireland broke into the open last night on the eve of
today's Anglo-Irish summit.
As Mr John Major gave a public pledge that any deal must be acceptable to
the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland, it emerged that the British prime
minister had rejected a peace plan tabled by Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart.
The plan, sent to London last month, provided for the Dublin government to
drop its constitutional claim to the north and to recognise that Irish
unification could come only with the consent of a majority in Ulster.
As a quid pro quo, the British side would have to agree to a document
endorsing the value of eventual Irish unity and to early and simultaneous
referendums in the republic and the north to provide a visible expression of
'self-determination'.
Mr Reynolds wanted the plan to provide the basis of the communique after
today's talks. The two leaders agreed to downgrade the status of the summit
after acrimonious exchanges earlier in the week threatened at one stage to
result in its cancellation. Dublin now refers to it as a 'working meeting'
rather than a summit.
It is understood that Mr Major was ready to accept a document framework that
included explicit recognition of the legitimacy of the aspirations of Irish
nationalists. But he rejected as unacceptable to moderate unionists the idea
that Britain should tacitly support the goal of Irish unity by signing up to
a statement proclaiming its 'value'.
Mr Major also judged that the proposal for joint referendums on
'self-determination' would dilute his government's commitment to the
Unionists' veto on constitutional change. Both sides were last night
attempting to play down the rift. In London, it was suggested a short
statement to be released after the talks would emphasise the two leaders'
commitment to seek an agreement.
Irish officials pointed out that by agreeing to a total of three working
meetings during December there was still room for manoeuvre and hope for
progress.
Mr Major, anxious to reassure Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party
after the disclosure of the government's clandestine contacts with Sinn
Fein, told MPs: 'There is for us one fundamental point: Northern Ireland's
status as part of the United Kingdom will not change without the freely
expressed consent of the people of northern Ireland.'
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in a thinly- veiled
reference to Mr Reynolds' plan, also rejected the idea the government could
recognise the goal as well as the aspiration of Irish unity.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Sinn Fein claims information received from British
government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, yesterday claimed it had received
highly sensitive information from the British government on its stance
towards the terrorist organisation.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein official closely involved in talks with
the Britain, said he had been told of a disagreement between Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, over how to deal with Sinn Fein.
The differences allegedly surfaced at a meeting chaired by Mr Major in May.
Downing Street said the allegations were 'inaccurate', but did not deny such
a meeting took place.
Sinn Fein also said it had copies of a Northern Ireland office briefing
paper on talks last year with Ulster's democratic parties.

FT  03 DEC 93 / US and EU close to trade deal: Brittan and Kantor hope to
reach outline agreement in talks on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The US and European Union last night appeared close to a comprehensive
bilateral deal on market access for industrial products and on trade in food
products.
But the absence of a definitive breakthrough because of last-minute snags is
still holding up overall progress in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations in
Geneva, involving 116 countries.
After 36 hours of intensive talks in Brussels between Sir Leon Brittan, the
EU's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative,
both sides said they hoped to reach an outline deal in a new bargaining
session on Monday.
Sir Leon won a vote of confidence at a meeting of EU foreign ministers late
last night. France, which has taken the hardest line, particularly over
international farm trade, threw its weight behind the tight timetable for a
deal with the US.
Officials of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva welcomed
France's 'clear willingness to do business', but they cautioned that little
time was left to meet the December 15 deadline for concluding the Gatt
talks.
They said other Gatt signatories were still holding back their best offers
in expectation of a US-EU deal.
'What we really need here is for market access to move,' said one Geneva
official.
The most significant progress appears to have been made in farm trade, an
issue that has dogged the Uruguay Round since it was launched in 1986. In
prospect is a deal providing improved access for US and other farm exporters
to Europe's market for grains, meat, dairy products and 'other speciality
crops'.
Negotiators were also confident of satisfying French demands for amendment
of the US-EU Blair House agreement regulating Europe's subsidised farm
exports.
Mr Kantor said: 'We are talking of an overall agriculture package that not
only the EU, but every country in the Community can agree to.'
However, Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister who chaired last
night's meeting, sounded a note of caution after most countries raised
concern about the scope of the potential market access deal and the lack of
detail provided by Sir Leon.
Mr Claes said: 'We are convinced that progress is being made constantly, but
it would be dangerous to draw conclusions at this stage.'
Sir Leon and Mr Kantor spoke of 'tangible progress' at their talks in
Brussels which allowed negotiators 'to see the outlines of a final package'.
Later Sir Leon indicated that the plan was to reach a broad deal on Monday
and for him to accompany Mr Kantor to Geneva to accelerate the multilateral
negotiations.
Little detail emerged from the talks as officials stressed that premature
publicity could jeopardise a deal. But Brussels indicated that the US was
taking a tough line on textiles and was still pressing Europe to further
open up its market in films and broadcasting.

FT  03 DEC 93 / US and EU close to farm deal: Market-opening accord still

The US and European Union appeared close to settling longstanding
differences on international farm trade last night. However, negotiators
fell short of the comprehensive bilateral market-opening deal needed for
successful completion of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation.
The farm trade issue has dogged the round since it was launched in 1986. In
prospect is a deal providing improved access for US and other farm exporters
to Europe's market for grains, meat, dairy products and 'other speciality
crops'.
Negotiators were also confident of satisfying French demands for amendment
of the US-EU Blair House agreement regulating Europe's subsidised farm
exports. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said: 'We are talking of
an overall agriculture package that not only the EU, but every country in
the Community can agree to.'
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, and Mr Kantor talked of
'tangible progress' at the end of 36 hours of intensive negotiation in
Brussels.
EU foreign ministers last night gave a positive response to Sir Leon's
report on his talks with Mr Kantor, but they asked him to provide detail on
all the outstanding issues at a second meeting on Monday.
Sir Leon said the plan was to reach a comprehensive bilateral deal on Monday
and for him to accompany Mr Kantor to Geneva to accelerate agreement between
all the other parties.
Mr Kantor has returned to Washington for further consultations with
President Bill Clinton and the US Congress.
Key differences remain over US access to Europe's film and television
markets, and on liberalising maritime services. US demands for better
protection of its anti-dumping laws under the draft Uruguay Round agreement
and its proposed amendments to the deal in financial services and taxation
are also being fiercely contested by the EU and many other US trading
partners.
Sir Leon last night reported on the outcome of the negotiations directly to
a special meeting of EU foreign and trade ministers, where it was critically
important that he won backing for the commitments already made to the US and
the likely compromises that will have to be made.
Conscious that time is rapidly running out ahead of the December 15 deadline
to complete a deal satisfactory to all 116 countries participating, Sir Leon
acknowledged the 'awesome responsibility' of the US and the EU to reach
agreement.
He said Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, had been kept fully informed on progress. Mr Sutherland
is making a statement in Geneva today to a meeting of Gatt negotiators from
all 116 countries involved.
Market-opening offers from other countries have been held back as the
critically important US-EU package has been awaited. 'It is essential for
other nations like Japan, the Asians and in Latin America to come forward
now with their best efforts,' Mr Kantor said.

FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The theory behind the recent surge in Volvo's shares has been that
opposition to the Renault merger reduced the immediate risk of earnings
dilution. Combining a recovering Volvo with a recession-bound Renault was
never particularly attractive in the short term. Now the opposition has won
the day, the market must move on to assess the long-term strategic lacuna.
With its limited model range and small home market, Volvo badly needs a
partner. But even operational collaboration with a jilted Renault will not
be easy. Alternatives may remain elusive while Renault still owns 10 per
cent. If Volvo needs fresh capital, meanwhile, even its most chauvinistic
shareholders should think carefully before stumping up any cash.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the size of the write-off at Redac was what unnerved Racal shareholders
yesterday, then a closer look might have reassured. Some Pounds 13.9m of the
Pounds 20.2m provision was a write-back of acquisition goodwill which had
previously been charged to the balance sheet. The Accounting Standards Board
is clearly right to insist that companies should not buy, run and sell a
business without recognising permanent losses of goodwill. Yet in this case,
as many others, the write-off is of merely historical interest with little
relevance to future prospects.
Equally, the 15 per cent fall in the share price may have reflected worries
about trading prospects. Military radio is an increasingly competitive field
in a shrinking defence market. The constant struggle to raise margins in the
data communications business is a race to stand still, since even
sophisticated technologies are rapidly becoming commodities. Managed
networks is a growth area but the company is pitched against some tough
telecoms competition. As ever, Racal's problem is to keep enough plates
spinning to keep profits moving. Avoiding nasty surprises might please the
market too.

FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GrandMet's tub-thumping defence of brands yesterday came as a startling
flash-back to the 1980s. But not even GrandMet appears wholly convinced by
its revivalist rhetoric. Its Pounds 175m restructuring charge to cut its
cost base certainly shows a healthier regard for the real competitive forces
shaping its markets. Much of that provision relates to its US food
businesses, which face a fierce fight defending premium prices. The bigger
concern, though, is over its European food arm, which is generating
operating profits of just Pounds 15m on sales of Pounds 735m, and appears
trapped in a strategic cul-de-sac.
Doubts about GrandMet's diversification into foods cannot obscure the
underlying strength of IDV. The loss of the Absolut vodka distribution
contract will knock profits this year. But IDV's geographic spread and
product mix should enable it to maintain robust progress, particularly in
developing markets.
GrandMet's growth ambitions remain constrained by its Pounds 2.8bn
borrowings. The disposal of Chef &amp; Brewer and its strongly improving cash
flow will help ease the strain. But with GrandMet's continuing woes at IEL
and Pearle - and its embarrassingly expensive legal dispute with Brent
Walker - still clouding the picture, it is hard to see how its 23 per cent
underperformance against the market over the past year will quickly be
reversed.

FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One way of looking at Royal Bank of Scotland's 25 per cent dividend increase
on cover of only 1.6 times is that the bank expects only modest loan growth.
Without mortgage lending its UK advances would not have grown at all last
year. So Royal may be anxious to avoid building up surplus capital. Its move
could thus be a signal that other banks will raise their payouts to avoid
excess profit retention as provisions come down. Royal's dividend, though,
is also a striking gesture of confidence that another year of bumper profits
lies ahead. It is not just Direct Line. Last year fee income, treasury
revenues and profits from its US subsidiary Citizens all showed rapid
growth, some of which at least should continue. Royal can thus rightfully
claim that diversification has reduced the volatility of its revenues while
putting them on a fast upward track. The question is whether this happy
combination can last.
At Direct Line, which the previous management stumbled across and the new
one has cannily locked into the group, prospects look good. Mortgage lending
may be less lucrative as base rates fall and competition increases. At some
point the market will doubtless perceive a limit to growth, but after
yesterday's dividend increase the shares have probably further to rise on
yield considerations alone.

FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson's house sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The alchemy which allowed Hanson to remain burdened with debt and yet
receive interest income is waning. Lower interest receivable in yesterday's
figures is the prelude to a nasty reversal next year, as the assumption of
Quantum's debt and falling income on sterling deposits start to bite.
Without action the interest bill will rise by around Pounds 275m. The need
for disposals to pay down debt suddenly looks more urgent.
Floating house building interests in the UK and US makes good sense.
Housebuilders generate little cash even on the upswing, since profits are
generally ploughed back into land. The prospectus will tell whether Hanson
has been reinvesting in this virtuous manner since it acquired Beazer Homes
in 1991. The size of the land bank will determine the final price. While
stock markets are taking a rosy view of recovery, though, Hanson will raise
more from flotation than trade sales, though the disposals should meet
Hanson's Pounds 500m existing overall target.
How much more is required depends on the strength of recovery. Even if
profits rise modestly from here, utilisation of provisions set up against
Beazer and Peabody - and the Pounds 540m cash cost of the dividend - will
leave little scope for debt reduction. That might explain the decision not
to raise the pay-out yesterday. The 5 per cent fall in the shares is similar
to the treatment meted out to BOC last month for taking the same decision.
Hanson's status as a yield stock cuts both ways.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Private finance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to be cynical about the government's initiative for attracting
private finance for UK public sector projects. One year after the initiative
was launched, there are still no new holes in the ground. Patience is
running out among many of the construction companies which would like to
build roads, railways, hospitals and schools and for the banks which would
like to finance them.
Yet some progress has been made in clearing the ground for involving the
private sector in providing public services. In the health service and on
the railways the initiative has eased rules on leasing expensive equipment.
NHS hospitals are now forming partnerships with the private sector to build
patient hotels. The home secretary plans to use the private sector to build
and manage six new prisons.
This week's Budget has opened up new possibilities. The firm commitment to
introduce tolling on motorways will eventually provide a stream of income to
reward companies which build new roads. Since it will be years before
electronic tolling can be introduced, the government has sensibly reversed
its opposition to shadow tolling. Thus investors in a new road can be paid
by the Department of Transport according to the number of vehicles using it.
The chancellor also committed the government to three larger projects,
including the modernisation of the west coast railway line between London
and Glasgow. This should reassure companies which have become frustrated
with 'no win competitions', where expensive tenders are submitted for
projects that are subsequently withdrawn. Mr Clarke has shown himself
commendably willing to sweep away Treasury orthodoxy on private finance,
especially in endorsing shadow tolling.
Yet most projects so far agreed have been either free-standing private
investments, such as the Dartford bridge over the Thames, or almost entirely
financed by the public sector, such as the Jubilee line underground
extension. The test will come with joint partnerships involving investment
by both the private and public sector.
The Treasury still appears to have an unrealistic view of the level of risk
which the private sector will accept in such partnerships. With the Channel
tunnel rail link, investors are being invited in before the legislative and
planning process is complete - against the advice of most experienced
advisers. The Treasury may also find it hard to stomach the returns that
private investors expect to make - especially if earned on the back of a
sizeable investment of taxpayers' money.
Striving to find solutions acceptable to both sides is, however, well
worthwhile. Contracting out services such as refuse removal and computer
management has already produced better value for money in central and local
government. The private finance initiative promises to extend similar
benefits throughout the public services.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Personal View: Down to earth, not distant visions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK VIBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deep divisions over the future of Europe were revealed during the
ratification process of the Maastricht treaty - not only in Denmark and the
UK but also in France and Germany. In order to heal these divisions, the
member states of the European Union are turning to a new pragmatic agenda
that promises tangible benefits rather than distant visions - one that
focuses on implementation rather than on new initiatives.
In the short run the agenda is already crowded.
First and foremost, there is the need to complete successfully by
mid-December the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations -
without which there will be an immediate crisis in the Union.
Second, membership negotiations with the European Free Trade Association
applicants - Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden - should be concluded in
spring next year. This is necessary to show that the Union is not an
exclusive club dividing rather than uniting Europe.
Third, there is the re-casting of the economic agenda to focus on the
micro-economic changes needed to improve Europe's economic performance
relative to the rest of the world. This does not depend on Community
transfers and new regulatory initiatives, but on getting rid of state aids,
enforcing competition within the single market and opening up those sectors
where state monopolies have led sheltered lives.
Fourth, in respect of macro-economic policy, this means discarding the
artificial deadlines for monetary union and emphasising instead the
convergence objectives of reducing budget deficits so that less burden is
placed on interest rates.
Fifth, there is a redefinition of the concept of 'social Europe' away from
its equation with new regulatory burdens on business or new financial
burdens on governments towards comparisons of 'best practice' in meeting
social objectives and towards harnessing private finance.
Sixth, the two 'pillars' of the Maastricht treaty (foreign security policy
and home affairs) must be shown to work despite the tarnishing effect of
events in former Yugoslavia.
Last, but not least, the Nato summit in January should see progress in
reformulating the purposes of the Atlantic alliance and extension of
security links eastwards.
This new pragmatism will be welcomed by many, not least by the business
community. Business would like to see the commission and other bodies focus
on their administrative and managerial tasks rather than the endless
invention of new legislative initiatives or visions for which there is no
clear path to attainment.
At the same time, this healthy turn towards pragmatism has to be guided by
an informed view of the longer-term development of the European Union. The
question of the kind of European Union we wish to see develop will not go
away. There will be renewed debate next year during elections for the
European parliament and in 1996 when the next intergovernmental conference
will be held.
Meanwhile, proposals for the next round of discussions on the future shape
of the European Union are being forwarded by a group of independent
academics and think-tanks from across Europe, known as the Constitutional
Group. Their report avoids terms which merely add to confusion, such as
'federal' or 'confederal', 'integrationist' or 'intergovernmental'. Equally,
it avoids simplistic and often self-interested assertions that development
of the Union simply involves giving more powers to central bodies such as
the commission or the European parliament.
Instead, the report addresses the basic questions Europe faces. How do we
structure a union that will embrace all democratic countries in Europe and
promote the interests of both the smaller and larger member states? How do
we redefine the role of the nation state and its institutions within the
Union? How do we entrench rule-based procedures rather than discretionary
powers in the Union? What are the fundamental values we should try to
enshrine in the development of political union?
No one should pretend there are easy answers. But if there was one lesson
from Maastricht it was the dangers of governments getting out of step with
their electorates. Closer union is in the interests of all. But it cannot be
imposed. It must rest on consent. Whether there will be consent to further
union may depend on whether governments can first demonstrate tangible
benefits of union from the successful pursuit of their new pragmatic agenda.

European Constitutional Group

The worst fears of Tokyo's salarymen are coming true. Japan's recession is
not turning out to be the short-lived blip that the bureaucrats said it
would be. To its credit, Japan's fractious coalition government is still
trying to revive the economy. But a sagging stock market, troubled banks and
increasingly uncompetitive exporters all suggest that a long and painful
period of retrenchment lies ahead.
The latest, if rather belated, evidence that the squeeze has a long way to
run comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Over the last two years, it has publicly supported the Japanese government
line that recovery was just around the corner - last June it forecast growth
of 1 per cent this year rising to 3.3 per cent next year.
But the truth has slowly sunk in. In its latest report on Japan, published
yesterday, the OECD has revised these forecasts to zero growth this year and
1.4 per cent next. But even these numbers are out of date. The OECD
secretariat now says it expects output to contract this year and grow by
less than 1 per cent next.
Have Japan's growth prospects been deteriorating that fast? No. The OECD has
been catching up with reality. It is true that Japanese industrial output
fell by 6.2 per cent in October compared with the same month last year. But
output also fell by more than 4 per cent in each of the first three quarters
of this year.
The reasons for this accelerating fall in output are well documented in the
report. Medium- and small-sized companies are hampered by a credit squeeze
imposed by indebted banks, while the sharp appreciation of the yen has cut
competitiveness. In 1990, US hourly wages were 109 per cent of Japan's. Now
they are 76 per cent.
The report also provides the government with the economic case it needs to
justify next week's further fiscal package. Up to now, the OECD has been
backing the Japanese bureaucracy in a sterile dispute with the US government
over the appropriate measure of Japan's fiscal stance. But, as this report
shows, even on the widest definition of the public sector, Japan has a much
lower ratio of net debt to gross domestic product than the OECD average.
In short, the government can safely cut income tax to stimulate consumer
demand, especially if the cut is balanced by a consumption tax rise far
enough into the future to avoid damaging recovery. Moreover, the scope for
tax reform and deregulation to free barriers to higher consumption and to
speed up the growth of the service sector is substantial.
Yet it looks increasingly doubtful that fiscal policy can do the trick
alone. A further discount rate cut, to hold down the yen, a degree of
monetisation of government debt and a temporary injection of Bank of Japan
capital into the banking sector look more likely to accelerate what is set,
in any case, to be a sluggish recovery.

<TEXT>
Instances of predatory behaviour by British insurance salesmen have become
so commonplace that revelations of mis-selling hardly come as a surprise.
Yet the Securities and Investments Board's latest findings, reported in the
Financial Times today, point to such extensive mis-selling in personal
pensions that the picture is becoming increasingly disturbing.
Failures of compliance appear to have taken place in a significant
proportion of the sales of nearly 500,000 personal pension plans to former
members of occupational pension schemes. These failures, which involve a
number of self-regulatory organisations including the SIB itself, go back as
far as 1988. A sampling exercise has established that countless transactions
were completed on the basis of inadequate investigation of the purchasers'
existing pension arrangements and financial affairs. The watchdogs
apparently did nothing to monitor those in the system whose selling
techniques were known to be in most urgent need of monitoring.
None of this need imply that personal pensions were inappropriate for each
and every one of the customers in question. There will be many, especially
among the young for whom the flexibility of a personal pension plan is
appealing, who may remain happy when their circumstances have been
investigated. But it is already clear that many older people have been
persuaded to leave good schemes with full index-linking of deferred
pensions. Here the benefits are most unlikely to be matched by a personal
pension. Redundant mineworkers, in particular, have been shamelessly gulled
by salesmen from some of the best-known names in insurance and banking.
It is not putting it too strongly to say that this is scandalous. And to its
credit the SIB is recognising as much in its response, which will aim to
provide appropriate financial remedies, in co-operation with the insurance
industry, over the next two years. Co-operation will almost certainly be
forthcoming, since the damage to the industry's already tarnished reputation
is potentially so great that urgent efforts at restitution are in the
insurers' own interest. But the task of investigation and finding
appropriate means of restitution will not be easy.
Nor will the damage to the regulatory structure be easy to repair. Insurance
has always been the Achilles' heel of the 1986 Financial Services Act
regime. Since the arrival of Mr Andrew Large at its head, the SIB has sought
more vigorously to address this weakness. Yet the latest revelations
indicate that an entirely new approach is needed to raise the standards of
salesmanship that now prevail in dealing with complex products such as
pensions. Education and training will have to be transformed if confidence
is to be re-established. In promoting personal pensions with such enthusiasm
before the regulatory regime had been tried and tested, the government has
shown itself to be pretty much on a par with the insurance salesmen.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Fewer good men in the line of fire: Defence cuts have
stopped just short of reducing the range of the UK's capabilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The billboard featured a tough-looking squad of soldiers and purported to be
announcing plans for privatising the British army. What it was actually
advertising was a well-known lager. It must have seemed a good joke at the
time. If there was one thing that could never be privatised, it was the
army. But that was five years ago.
Since that spoof advertisement appeared, bits of armed forces activity have
been transferred to the private sector. Go to an army base in mainland
Britain, and you will no longer find mess meals being cooked, served and
cleared up by the Army Catering Corps, but by civilians. Join the RAF or
navy as a novice pilot and you will be initiated in flying by a civilian
instructor on an aircraft owned and operated by a private-sector company.
More is to come. Many military vehicles and other equipment will not in
future belong to the forces but be leased from contractors. Forces' married
quarters will be hived off on a long lease to a private-sector housing
trust. Training, transport, distribution, spares and storage may
increasingly be looked after by private companies. Already radically shaken
up under the government's 1990 Options for Change defence reforms, the
forces' support branches are set to be shaken up again in the quest for
economies.
Defence planners are searching for ways to absorb a fresh and unwelcome
series of spending cuts without damaging the forces' fighting strength.
The forces have not yet got over Options for Change. For instance, 80 per
cent of armoured regiments have either just amalgamated or are now doing so.
But pressure on the Pounds 23.5bn annual defence budget has kept increasing.
Defence spending is now 16 per cent lower in real terms than in the
mid-1980s. A further 12 per cent reduction in real terms is planned by
1996-97.
The biggest cut comes at the end of the three-year budget cycle. The Pounds
22.7bn now planned for 1996-97 is reckoned to be Pounds 1bn less than the
MoD had been counting on in its own confidential plans. This seriously
alters the assumptions military planners must use for subsequent years. MoD
officials who have spent three months drawing up long-term costings for the
next 15 years must now redo their sums.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, argued long and hard with the
Treasury over this delayed-action spending curb, while Tory backbenchers dug
themselves in to resist further cuts in frontline combat units. Rising
bitterness in the forces, already reduced in numbers from 320,000 a decade
ago to 270,000 and on course to shrink to about 230,000 in the late 1990s,
broke into the open last month when Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon,
chief of the air staff, sounded off about a 'disreputable campaign' being
waged against the services.
He and the other service chiefs twice made use of their prerogative to see
the prime minister directly, in late September and again in October. Senior
officers described it as the most difficult public expenditure round they
could remember.
The MoD had carefully laid its defences. Its annual white paper in July
listed 50 tasks the forces were being asked to fulfil in defence of the UK
and its dependencies, in Nato or in support of wider British interests such
as peacekeeping. Numbers of battalions, ships and air squadrons were neatly
assigned to each military role. In many cases military units were earmarked
for two or more roles at once. Almost all the overseas tasks could be done
by drawing on the forces provided for UK and Nato defences.
The exercise was meant to challenge the Treasury. The implicit message was
that, if big savings were wanted, it would mean scaling down or abandoning
one or more commitments. Which - apart from peripheral commitments such as
Belize, where the British garrison is being withdrawn - would the government
be prepared to drop?
But Mr Rifkind's cabinet colleagues declined the challenge. According to an
MoD planner, defence policy is not at issue. The question is whether it has
to cost so much. 'It is clear,' he says, 'that the centre of government does
not believe in the efficiency of the MoD as an organisation.'
The result will be what senior officers describe as 'another massive
trimming exercise' - an attempt to do the same job on reduced means. But if
funds continue to be squeezed year by year, as seems likely, Britain's
broad-ranging defence effort risks becoming increasingly difficult to
sustain.
The defence cuts so far have not reduced the range of military capabilities.
One exception is the RAF's sub-strategic nuclear capability, which it is due
to lose once its current bombs become obsolete. A new missile programme was
formally abandoned last month, saving Pounds 1.8bn from the MoD's long-term
budget provisions. Instead, Trident submarines, carrying limited numbers of
warheads, will be the UK's all-purpose nuclear deterrent.
But the array of conventional capabilities, from armoured warfare to
strategic reconnaissance, is untouched. Choosing between them would
inevitably stir controversy since it would mean favouring one service over
another.
To avoid the kind of political storm that blew up over the future of
infantry battalions, the MoD aims to avoid any further loss of combat units.
But there will be more base reductions and closures, and numerous equipment
programmes are likely be curtailed, delayed or downgraded.
A number of important procurement decisions have been held up by this year's
budget arguments. Some - the purchase of more Challenger 2 tanks,
minehunters and RAF support helicopters - have now got the go-ahead. But
others, including new Sea Harrier jets, an overdue production order for
torpedoes and bidding for the first of two new assault ships, are still
pending.
Back-up support for the services will now undergo close scrutiny in order to
concentrate manpower and effort on the front line. Mr Rifkind has said the
changes will have to be radical to achieve adequate savings. This is likely
to mean transferring some activities outside the services and merging others
on a joint-service basis. Munitions maintenance, for instance, is being
rationalised, with the navy taking the main responsibility for sophisticated
weapons and the army for basic ammunition. But in other areas the three
services stand apart. Each has its doctors, dentists, educators and lawyers.
'The only thing we've managed to amalgamate in 10 years,' says a senior
officer at MoD headquarters, 'is dog training.'
But other officers believe the real opportunities are limited, since the
services are distinct and usually at some distance from each other. 'Joint
training in everything would be irrelevant and probably a waste of time,'
says one.
In any event, few of these measures promise to bring short-term savings. The
temptation will be to cut training activity and 'consumables' such as fuel
and ammunition. This goes down badly with service chiefs. It may cost an
extra Pounds 500,000 to send a large unit to train overseas, say officers.
But if British forces are to play a worldwide role, such training is
'absolutely vital'.
Some symbols of that reputation are already showing the signs of hard times.
There are fewer bands and smaller guards of honour for state visits. Foot
guards lining the streets on ceremonial occasions now stand nine feet apart
instead of six. 'We're having to spread people a bit more thinly,' says the
army.
Among the victims of the latest cuts will almost certainly be the
40-year-old Royal Yacht Britannia. Paid for out of the defence budget, it
will have to go - unless the Queen finds the means to defray its Pounds
12.5m annual costs, or industry takes it over to promote Britain's image
overseas. We may not have the Carling British Army, but could we be soon be
cheering the Whitbread Royal Yacht?

Last week's sudden announcement that Paris's Grand Palais - the vast,
Crystal Palace-type building near the Champs Elysees used for block-buster
art shows - is closing for FFr250m of emergency repairs, is somewhat
embarrassing.
Among the 20 exhibitions planned for 1994 were January's highly successful
SIME salon of museums; March's Salon du Dessin drawings fair; and
September's glamorously expensive Biennale des Antiquaires antiques show.
Even more distressing than this blow to exhibitors and sponsors is the
consequent buffeting of French pride. After all, the Palais was conceived as
a monument to the brilliance of modern French engineering in the 1900
Universal Exhibition.
France's culture minister, Jacques Toubon, now admits that the Grand Palais
was a jerry-built affair; four different architects had a go and the roof
was still leaking 70 years later.
The only bit of the building which has been ruled as structurally sound and
will remain open throughout the enforced closure is the police station,
responsible for guarding President Mitterrand in the nearby Elysee Palace.

Remember Kevin Morley, Rover's marketing supremo who transformed himself
into an advertising agency last year? He seems to have made a scintillating
success of his first year - at least in terms of his salary.
In the first 18 months of the Kevin Morley Group Ltd, he paid himself a
salary of Pounds 481,593, including a performance-related bonus of Pounds
304,316, according to accounts filed at Companies House.
That works out at Pounds 321,062 annually, a smidgeon more than that taken
by Maurice Saatchi, chairman of advertising mammoth Saatchi and Saatchi.
Mind you, Morley has some way to go before he reaches the level of Martin
Sorrell, chief executive of WPP. He got Pounds 510,000 in 1992.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Observer: King holds on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news from the Bank of England. Its chief economist, Mervyn King, has
decided to stay on rather than return to academe when his three-year leave
of absence from the London School of Economics ends.
Not only is King, 45, one of Britain's best regarded economists, but he is
also a keen advocate of greater openness in UK policymaking. He wants to see
greater independence for the Bank in setting interest rates, mainly because
this would make officials more accountable to the public for their various
policy mistakes. He's generally thought to have made more of a go of the job
than John Flemming, his predecessor, who is now warden of Wadham College,
Oxford.
There had been rumours that King's enthusiasm for life at the Bank had been
tempered by the arrival of ex-Economist editor Rupert Pennant-Rea as deputy
governor. However, King's decision to stay on as an executive director
suggests that any tensions between the two have been resolved. Having lost
Andrew Crockett to the Bank for International Settlements, Threadneedle
Street could ill afford to lose another high-flyer in the space of a few
months.

<TEXT>
Britain's royal family can sleep soundly again; the financial headache of
how to pay for the restoration of the fire-ravaged Windsor Castle could soon
be over, thanks to piles of the black stuff.
No, not coal - oil. According to an article in the Oil and Gas Journal, the
US oil industry's bible, Her Majesty could be sitting on top of one of
Britain's biggest onshore oilfields.
Desmond Oswald, boss of the little-known Canuk Exploration, has been poking
around underneath the castle for the past four years. He believes that as
many as 100m barrels of oil may be trapped in a reservoir which begins only
1,000 feet below the Castle. Little is known about Canuk, based in Gerrards
Cross, but other oil industry sources say the idea is not as barmy as it
sounds.
Oswald expresses surprise that 'such a large structure should have remained
undrilled in a country where extensive exploration has taken place'. Having
done his homework, he is now seeking a competent operator to contribute
financially to the drilling of an exploratory well.
Of course, the royals may not be amused at the thought of nodding donkeys
taking their place alongside the Household Cavalry. But times have changed.
Prince Edward has set himself up in the film business and his mum opened
Buckingham Palace to paying gogglers for a few weeks this summer. The
possibility of a gusher under Windsor Castle should not be ignored just
because it might keep the occupants awake at night.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Treatment for shaky growth: The health of US drugs group
Merck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For seven years, Merck, the world's largest drugs group, has been voted
Fortune magazine's most admired US company. Its reputation has been based on
a talent for discovering and developing new medicines, innovative and
successful joint ventures, and an apparently remorseless ability to achieve
double-digit earnings growth.
But Merck's global standing, and the judgment of Dr Roy Vagelos, its
charismatic chairman, are now being questioned. Sales growth is faltering,
battered by an increasingly competitive environment; the launch of Proscar,
a treatment for enlarged prostate, has been disappointing; and Merck has few
exciting new drugs in the pipeline.
In addition, the direction of the company remains unclear after Dr Vagelos's
retirement next year. His heir apparent and chief operating officer, Mr
Richard Markham, resigned unexpectedly in July. No obvious successor has
emerged.
Concerns among shareholders that Merck had lost its way were heightened soon
after Mr Markham's departure, when the group announced its intention to
acquire Medco Containment, a drugs mail order company, for Dollars 6bn.
Medco has an annual turnover of Dollars 2.5bn and net income of Dollars
138m.
The deal, which has been given the go-ahead by regulatory authorities, is a
radical departure for Merck, and signals a shift from research and
development to distribution.
The acquisition has been described as a watershed in the drug industry. Dr
Vagelos says: 'We're not just trying to remodel Merck, we're trying to
remodel the entire industry. The rest of the sector normally follows what we
do.'
However, industry executives and the investment community remain divided
over the move. Some view it as visionary and inspired. Others believe the
acquisition was overpriced and will offer no lasting competitive advantage
in pharmaceuticals marketing.
The Medco acquisition is Merck's response to the rapid changes overtaking US
pharmaceuticals. In the world's largest market, hospitals and doctors are
banding together to negotiate bulk discounts. Merck estimates that in 1991
only 33 per cent of health provision was supplied through bulk buyers, known
as managed care organisations. Within two years, it forecasts the figure
will be 67 per cent.
Merck believes the implications of this consolidation are momentous. It is
particularly being hit by discounts in the highly competitive markets of
cholesterol-lowering treatments and medicines for hypertension.
Bulk buying has been accompanied by greater prescribing of generic drugs,
which are less expensive than their patented counterparts. Kline, the
New-York based industry analyst, believes the generics sector could double
to Dollars 10bn between 1992 and 1996. The growth of generics will
accelerate as patents expire over the next two years, including that of
Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten, a heart drug with worldwide sales of Dollars
1.6bn.
'Competition has already lowered prices of drugs,' says Dr Vagelos.
'Annualised price increases to the third quarter of 1993 averaged only 3.5
per cent. That compares with 9.9 per cent in 1990. We see price increases as
a thing of the past.' The healthcare reforms being prepared by the Clinton
administration will exacerbate the industry's plight, he adds.
As a result, the growth of the US market is slowing, from 18 per cent in
1992 to 4 per cent this year, according to observers. In this sluggish
environment, market share is increasingly important.
Such a consideration was an impetus behind the acquisition of Medco, which
supplies medicines to about 33m Americans. The crucial factor is whether
Merck can expand that number. If Dr Vagelos succeeds, the deal should pay
for itself within three years, as Merck promises.
Dr Vagelos says there are other benefits. 'We will acquire the ability to
capture all the information when a person has a mail order prescription or
goes to a pharmacy. This will allow us to capture more and more data on the
individual, the diagnosis, and the doctor,' he explains.
He believes Medco's large databases will give Merck valuable information
about the cost-effectiveness of its treatments. In a scheme known as
capitation, Merck intends to use this information to provide large US
companies with medical cover for employees for an annual set fee per head.
'We will share the risk. One of our drugs is Proscar, which is fantastic for
stopping the growth of benign prostate enlargement. We are talking to
customers about putting their males who have enlargement on our drug and
then guaranteeing they will get relief. If not, we will pay for the
operation needed to deal with it.'
Not all are convinced by Dr Vagelos's vision of integrated pharmaceutical
care. Mr Ronald Nordmann, pharmaceuticals analyst at PaineWebber, the New
York broker, says: 'I've recommended Merck as a buy every day since 1985.
But when it announced its intention to buy Medco, I stopped.'
One criticism of the Medco deal is that Merck, with its bureaucratic
organisation, will be unable to manage the entrepreneurial mail order group.
To counter this perception Merck could install Mr Martin Wygod, Medco's
free-wheeling chairman, as its chairman when Dr Vagelos retires. Mr Wygod is
already due to join the board.
Other criticisms centre on the possible antagonism of Medco's suppliers and
customers. The suppliers, for the most part Merck's competitors, could prove
unwilling to supply drugs that boost Merck's profits. Managed care customers
may be concerned they will increasingly be offered only Merck's drugs, which
may not be the best or cheapest options.
Finally, it is not clear whether the advantage offered by Medco is
sustainable. Merck's competitors could form similar ventures, or gain access
to more comprehensive databases at less cost from insurance companies - an
idea they are now contemplating.
If Medco's growth slows and fails to generate significant increases in
volume for Merck, the deal could prove a drain on profits. Medco's Dollars
6bn price tag could be an expensive entry fee into distribution.
'It could prove to be the most brilliant deal in the history of the
pharmaceuticals industry, offering vertical integration and allowing Merck
to get closer to its customers. The logic is good. But the price looks too
high and the future growth of Medco is questionable,' says Mr Nordmann.
Merck should be given credit for trying to stay ahead of the game, forcing
change rather than having it forced upon it. But by moving fast, the world's
largest drugs group could be moving in the wrong direction.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Direct debits more efficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD TYSON-DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr T J Walsh (Letters, November 25) describes the giro payment system
available in Switzerland and suggests that British banks should be taking
similar steps to reduce cheque volumes. He misses the point. Most households
in the UK already use an even more efficient way of paying their regular
bills: the direct debit scheme. Once a direct debit instruction has been
signed, no further action at all is required by the customer and, even if he
is abroad or otherwise unable to attend to his affairs, the bills still get
paid on time.
His peace of mind is further enhanced by the provision of a money-back
guarantee in the very rare event that an error occurs. The scheme is
actively promoted by UK banks and building societies and, indeed, more than
1bn direct debit payments will be made in 1993.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp - plutonium safeguards one
thing, security costs another
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL GRUBB and Professor TREVOR TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The extensive debate on Thorp in your pages has missed points of
central importance. The measures employed to safeguard the plutonium
separated will add further to the costs but cannot resolve the fundamental
security problems.
The global surplus of separated plutonium is a fact reaffirmed as a serious
concern by the then deputy director of the International Atomic Energy
Agency at this institute a year ago. The world cannot develop enough
capacity to burn up this surplus over the next few years. Consequently, any
plutonium from Thorp which is consumed in civil applications will be partly
at the expense of leaving other plutonium in more diverse and vulnerable
locations for longer. This includes both weapons grade material arising from
superpower arms reductions, and reactor grade plutonium (which is quite
adequate for terrorist weapons) in various countries. Even if every atom
separated at Thorp is burned as promised, it thus exacerbates a difficult
security problem.
The safest solution to the security problem is to place all separated
plutonium in a physically inaccessible form (vitrification) and/or secure
international repository (which could include Sellafield). But the relevant
governments - including Russia's - are reluctant to contemplate this due to
their perception of plutonium as a potentially valuable fuel. Thorp's
operation, and claims about the value of its products, will reinforce this
myth.
Thorp's operation may mean fissile material being held in a range of states
which may not use it for decades, a period in which their political
orientation may shift dramatically. It will be difficult to refuse custom
from currently 'acceptable' regimes, even if they may be politically
unreliable in the longer term. Governments holding plutonium stocks for
genuine civil purposes may also provoke fears among their neighbours. There
are signs that South Korea may seek plutonium should Japan's stockpile
increase.
Finally, the security regime surrounding the separation, storage and
transport of plutonium from Thorp is impressive. But how much will it cost,
and who is going to pay? Unless the requirements are fully costed and
accounted for, not only is the economic case distorted, but the regime
itself may eventually be weakened by financial constraints, as has occurred
previously with IAEA safeguards operations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke is bemused by the effect of his Budget. He must have
anticipated groans about the increases in tax, or the pressure on spending.
Instead there is euphoria, and not only in the markets. This could be a
worry. The chancellor has been in politics long enough to be aware of the
superstition that if you are greeted by cheers on the day of delivery, there
is trouble in store. If the economy doesn't get you, your admirers will.
When you have been puffed up to the dizzying heights, there is only one way
to go.
We can consider some of the possible pitfalls in a moment. First it must be
emphasised that the Budget has achieved its purpose. It has started the
process of restoring the government's authority. This remains as true three
mornings after delivery as it did on first hearing Mr Clarke's words on
Tuesday. The chancellor had one aim: to begin to lift Mr John Major's
administration out of the hole into which it had fallen. The party, and with
luck the electorate, had to be shown that Downing Street was back in control
of economic policy, following 14 months of destabilisation.
Mr Clarke reckoned that his best bet was to produce proposals that would
eventually eliminate the Pounds 50bn deficit. All else followed. The public
was prepared to expect more austere measures than in fact emerged. That is a
routine pre-Budget ploy. The actual cuts and imposts were chosen for their
likely acceptability on Conservative backbenches. Nice thoughts about
creating a symmetrical or coherent system of taxation were suppressed as
irrelevant.
The speech was carefully crafted. Aware that the House of Commons will not
listen to anyone for longer than about 90 minutes, the chancellor pruned his
words ruthlessly. The traditional, lengthy world-view of the state of
economies here there and everywhere was omitted - although Treasury
officials would have included one had they been asked. The new unified tax
and spending Budget, which enabled the chancellor to announce many decisions
in one go, provided him with a unique platform. He would not be Kenneth
Clarke if he was not aware that this hugely strengthened the power of the
chancellor, and thus his influence with the rest of the government.
This enabled him to make quick or possibly controversial decisions, without
being over-ly concerned about the prime minister's reaction. His
predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont, was not so fortunate. To take one example, Mr
Major was always unsure about changing invalidity benefit. The upshot of the
chancellor's efforts to spread the burden was that numerous small items were
necessarily crammed into an address that turned out to be of greater
significance in stating government policy than the Queen's Speech at the
opening of parliament. Mr Clarke may or may not make it to No 10 Downing
Street, but this week he is tasting some of the delights of being first
among equals.
That said, the government is not out of its hole yet. Take taxation. The
shadow chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, has made a good start to what will be an
energetic, and sensible, Labour campaign to remind the electorate that it
was hoodwinked by the Tories in April 1992. The Conservatives promised lower
taxes, no extention of value added tax, and no increase in national
insurance contributions. All three undertakings have been cast aside. This
may have an effect on future election results, although I doubt it. Much
depends on the attention-span of the average voter. Is it as long as that of
an elephant - or do most of us have the political memory of a gnat?
Public spending cuts may be a more serious pitfall. The reductions depend on
squeezing public sector pay. The hardest hit sector is probably local
government. Think ahead, as Mr Clarke surely does, to next April. Picture
the scene. A new bargaining round has begun, but so far the government's
freeze is sticking. In come the higher taxes, and VAT on domestic fuel,
ordained by Mr Lamont in March and Mr Clarke this week. The inevitable
upwards blip in inflation created by the Budget makes itself felt. People
who have nodded over the favourable comments made since Tuesday suddenly
notice where Mr Clarke's fiscal prudence is coming from: their pockets.
Plenty of work for the trade unions, and Mr Brown, there.
The supposed government attack on the welfare state is another potential
vote-loser for the Conservatives, at least in Labour eyes. But is it? The
rhetoric of Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley has a calculated
purpose. These hatchet-men of the right are working to a long timetable.
They are believers in the minimal state, but they are wise enough to proceed
slowly, softening up opinion in advance, threatening more than they do.
Their aim, which they pursue with skill, is ever to push forward the
frontiers of the thinkable.
Mr Clarke is not a philosopher. His Budget contained nothing on the social
security side that is not defensible in its own terms. If it hit
Portillo-Lilley targets, they were soft ones. More effective rules for
invalidity benefits are common sense. Asking unemployed people to draw on
their own savings, if they have any, after six months on contributory
benefits is tough, but Beveridge would have understood. Making the system
more like workfare is welcome. Equalising the state pension age at 65, after
two decades' notice, is overdue. Throwing in a new benefit to help mothers
who take low-paid jobs to finance childcare was Mr Clarke's signal to the
moralists of the right.
When the chancellor had gone through his Budget at Tuesday morning's cabinet
meeting, several ministers spoke on the welfare state. The upshot was a
concordat between right and left. 'This government will never take part in
any attempt to dismantle the welfare state,' Mr Clarke said in his speech
later that afternoon. Any deal has a price. 'We must make sure that it is a
system that future generations will be able to afford,' he also said. Labour
cannot successfully quarrel with that. It will have to wait until its
Commission for Social Justice has reported next summer before it can joust
with the minimalists' arguments. The Labour leader, Mr John Smith, should
not dilly-dally for too long. If the Conservatives have the will to build on
what has been a good week for them, they will stop looking like losers
comfortably in advance of a 1996 election.

Sir, Mr Nigel Wilkins (Letters, November 26) makes an excellent suggestion:
that names of directors of failed companies should be publicised. But this
should be augmented by names of directors and companies (and of their
ultimate holding company) that failed to pay their bills on time - which
contributes to business failure.
No public honours should be awarded to directors of companies which impose
inequitable or untimely payment arrangements on their suppliers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID REX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While the adverse impact which late payment of trade debt has on
company cash flows cannot be denied, we can hope that the government
undertakes an objective assessment of all the causes before being seduced
into seeing the statutory right to interest on late payment as a panacea.
Working in this area for clients both large and small, we continue to find
that many of the causes of late payment lie within the seller's own sales
and delivery process. This includes, for example, poor specification of
contractual terms and failure to invoice, or invoice correctly, until well
after supply. Looking inwardly and addressing internal operating
deficiencies may prove harder than placing all responsibility for late
payment on to the customer but, in our experience, this approach has always
achieved reductions of more than 50 per cent in overdue debt outstanding.
Of course there are managements which are bad payers as a matter of intent,
and sellers need the means to secure swift and just redress. However, for
small businesses, in particular, the existing legal process is seen as slow
and cumbersome, with the likely result not expected to accord with the
resources required to achieve it. Rather than adding more legislative
burdens to inadequate mechanisms, the government would do better to make the
existing legal process in this area work more effectively for the plaintiff.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Textiles bargaining tactic heavy
handed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms HARRIET LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr J A Nightingale, chairman of the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles
Alliance, calls (Letters, November 30) on developing countries to lift their
barriers to textiles and clothing in exchange for the phasing-out of the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA).
The MFA is a legalised derogation from the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, imposed on developing countries as a 'temporary measure' 20 years
ago. Imposing unilateral restrictions and then using them as a bargaining
chip to get access to developing nations' markets amounts to heavy-handed
tactics, not at all conducive to good trading relations.
At Punta del Este, to which Mr Nightingale refers, governments in fact
agreed to ensure that developing countries received 'differential and more
favourable treatment'. Their declaration stated: 'Developed countries do not
expect reciprocity in their reduction of barriers to trade to developing
countries, that is they do not expect developing countries to make
contributions which are inconsistent with the individual development,
financial and trade needs.'
Ending the MFA is one of the few benefits which the Gatt proposal offers
developing countries. Diluting those gains by further extending the MFA or
pressing for yet more reciprocal actions - options which President Clinton
is now exploring - would seriously undermine their economic prospects.
Mr Nightingale is right to call for serious bargaining. But surely, instead
of trying to wring yet more concessions out of poor countries, his industry
would do better to focus on the tariffs ranging from 35 to 60 per cent
imposed on European textiles by South Africa, Australia or the US.

<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Grade (Letters, November 27) may be right to say that the
concentration of power in too few ITV hands threatens the free market
designs of the 1990 Broadcasting Act.
But he mentions only two of the three radical proposals on which the Act's
intentions rested. In addition to the Channel 3 licence tenders and the
separation of Channel 4 as an advertising competitor, the Act instructed the
Independent Television Commission 'to do all they can to secure the
provision' of a Channel 5 for the UK.
It is not evident that the ITC has carried out parliament's wishes, and now
is surely the time to ensure that they do so. Advertisers, viewers and
independent producers would be the beneficiaries.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: Bogdanov's Julius Caesar - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The English Shakespeare Company is in the midst of what may be its last tour
in its present form. Since it was founded under Michael Bogdanov in 1986, it
has provided a mixture of the inspired, the perverse and the indifferent.
Its Julius Caesar, currently playing at the Shaw Theatre in London, contains
the same mixture, though perhaps with less emphasis on the inspired.
The women are outstanding: Mandana Jones as Calpurnia, wife of Caesar, and
Caroline Harris as Portia, wife of Brutus. They almost succeed in showing
that if they had been in charge, the tragedy would never have happened. In
the scene where Portia speaks of giving herself a voluntary wound in the
thigh to show her constancy, Ms Harris savagely stabs herself in the upper
leg.
There is also new meaning in Caesar's line: 'Let me have men about me that
are fat.' This Caesar, played by David Sterne, is a paunchy figure,
certainly not obese, but well-made. Dressed in a camel coat, no tie and a
long white evening scarf, he looks a jolly enough fellow, perhaps presiding
over a rugby club rather imperial Rome.
Terry McGinity's Cassius is very impressive, a genuinely worried man,
possibly rightly convinced that Caesar must go. And it is here, as in
several other recent productions of the play, that one notices a change in
sympathies. Tradition had it that Brutus was the noblest Roman of them all.
Cassius was a conspirator with not much to be said for him. Mark Antony was
a chancer who emerged as the hero.
Modern taste has begun to lean more towards Cassius as the most interesting
figure. Certainly in this ESC production, directed by Tim Carroll, Brutus is
a very dull man by contrast. Played by Burt Caesar, he seems neither the
brightest or the noblest.
Alex Hardy's Antony is more of a pop star. When he incites the crowd at
Caesar's funeral, he employs deliberate hysteria from the start. There is no
gradual build-up. And when he makes his final comment on Caesar at the end
of the play, it is almost flip. He tosses off the lines about nature
standing up to all the world and saying 'This was a man' as if they had only
just occurred to him and will be as quickly forgotten.
The production is done effortlessly in modern dress. More puzzling is why
the set, designed by Rae Smith, seems to be vaguely South African. It adds
nothing to the play, but nor does it particularly detract.
The ESC is sponsored by IBM. Next week at the same theatre Bogdanov will
present his version of the Faust legend, designed especially for children.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: Heavenly encounter - Karen Fricker hails the Broadway
production of Tony Kushner's epic play 'Angels in America'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six months ago Tony Kushner's Millennium Approaches, the Pulitzer Prize
winning first half of his epic play Angels in America, took Broadway by
storm, sweeping the Tony Awards and playing to sell-out houses.
Perestroika, the second half of Angels, which joined Millennium at the
Walter Kerr Theatre last week, both directed by George C. Wolfe, not only
completes the theatrical journey that Millennium began but is a complete
dramatic experience of pathos, humour, and insight. The running time for the
two plays is a total of seven hours; a different production of Perestroika,
directed by Declan Donnelan, opened at London's National Theatre last week.
In Millennium, Kushner sets in motion several interweaving plots that
illustrate the identity crisis of 1980s America: a gay couple split apart by
Aids; a Mormon couple similarly disintegrating when the husband begins to
question his sexuality; and the arch-evil Roy Cohn on his own downward
spiral, infected with Aids and embodying the nation's greed and
self-interest. Kushner traffics in fantasy in Millennium, but the play grabs
the audience's imagination and its heart because the unreal world he creates
seems more like life than finely detailed naturalism.
In Perestroika, the first play's stories untangle, settle, and resolve with
bracing pace and crackling dialogue which is even funnier than that in
Millennium. Yet it is a darker play than the first; Kushner seems to be
reeling the audience in after Millennium's blast of adrenalin. While in
Millennium the Mormon wife Harper takes a Valium trip to Antarctica, in
Perestroika she only makes it as far as the Brooklyn Bridge. In Millennium,
Harper and Prior, the gay man with Aids, meet in his jewel-encrusted drag
fantasy; in Perestroika, they meet in a grotty Mormon visitors' centre.
Prior's heavenly encounter in Millennium is that play's coup de theatre: a
gorgeous white-winged angel crashes through his ceiling and calls him a
prophet. Prior makes it to heaven in Perestroika, but it is a dark and
mournful place, with a backdrop of broken columns and a bevy of
black-gowned, silent angels; little wonder he rejects their offer of
immortality and returns to the flawed earth.
The most surprising thing about Perestroika is its uplifted ending. There
are those who will be unwilling to accept that a writer who lays out what is
wrong with the world could, in the same (extended) dramatic breath, embrace
the world despite its flaws. Yet Kushner's resolution of the play's plots
and themes cannot be faulted on a dramatic level; it is intellectually and
emotionally logical and, yes, uplifting: wrong is punished, the good get
another chance, and even the most hardened show the capacity for change.
In the epilogue, the arc of the play that rises during Millennium and
descends throughout Perestroika completes its journey. Prior closes the play
by speaking to the audience the words the angel gave him at the end of
Millennium: 'the great work begins'. It is a challenge, and an act of
benediction.
The work for us may be just beginning, but for Kushner it is finally
complete. He has turned Perestroika around since its world premiere in Los
Angeles last November, when it appeared as a deeply flawed attempt to tie up
Millennium's strands. Kushner transformed Perestroika not by adding new
material but by cutting and reshaping.
While director Wolfe's work on Millennium was sketchy and tentative, he
directs Perestroika with subtlety, verve, and intelligence. Millennium
dragged, but Perestroika clips along, its comic timing acute, scenes
intersecting and overlapping in a contained explosion of energy. While Robin
Wagner's set of revolving walls and sliding panels, which both plays share,
seemed an unhappy compromise in Millennium, the design is put to livelier
use in Perestroika.
Wolfe's excellent cast has only improved since Millennium. Stephen Spinella,
who has played Prior since Angels' first production in San Francisco in
1991, is still breathtakingly fresh in the role. Kathleen Chalfant moves
between roles, from the 'world's oldest living Bolshevik' in the prologue to
the tight-lipped Mormon mother, to Ethel Rosenberg, with extraordinary ease.
In Wolfe's Millennium, Ron Leibman had every look of an actor out of control
as Roy Cohn - all spitting, gasping intensity; here it keeps that fierceness
in check and his deathbed rantings are both harrowing and hilarious. Marcia
Gay Harden's Harper is a revelation: she combines childish petulance and
womanly longing to make what previously seemed an unplayable character one
of the play's central figures.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: 'The Nutcracker', Kirov style - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drosselmeyer's disease is a mysterious scourge. No respecter of persons, it
afflicts dancers, public, managements - even critics, who might be thought
to be immune - with a mindless desire to see or perform The Nutcracker.
Deformity is often part of the sickness, since versions of the ballet can be
stupid, revisionist, loaded with as much gimcrackery as a Christmas tree.
Yet maddened by a need to hear the score, and often to traduce it, crazed by
a lust for snowflakes, giant mice and toy soldiers - you may judge how
hideous are the symptoms - the victims flock to theatres, seeking
alleviation for this syndrome. Like 'flu it is a winter hazard, and like the
new Beijing strain, it is among us now.
Five different stagings are threatened this year: the first outbreak - I'd
venture the size of Birmingham's Royal Ballet - is well mannered in
technique, with a style that speaks clearly of Kirov example. It looks, even
in the merry nonsense of Nutcracker, coherent as an ensemble, unified in
training. The production they bring is a bit of a muddle, but since this
visit has been arranged at breakneck speed (the Ballet du Nord's defection
was only six weeks ago) we can accept a somewhat routine air to the
narrative, and be grateful for the central seriousness of the event.
The production is by Nikolay Boyarchikov, a former director of the company,
and is cursory in dramatics. Its fascination is that it incorporates much of
the Nutcracker choreography made in 1934 by the eminent Leningrad
ballet-master Vasily Vainonen. We have seen some of this before in Kirov
performance, and its surely-made classicism argues the importance of
Vainonen as a creator. What is new to us, and remarkable, is Vainonen's
fashioning of the snowflakes' waltz. Bold in shape, driven and swirling
through shifting patterns, the dance evokes not the gently drifting
snowflakes we are used to, but a storm of Russian snow as it falls. I
thought it beautiful in its sweep, and excellently done by a strong female
corps.
The company is lively in this, as in everything. Though the dramatic line of
the first act is unconvincing, because Drosselmeyer is unclear as a motive
force, the dancers are enthusiastic, and the thin 'look' of the production
(Soviet-flimsy in Act 1; much more magical with the snow scene) must be
excused because of the haste of this visit. The child heroine, Masha, was
taken on Wednesday with real charm and, when transformed into the second
act's ballerina, with brilliancy of means by Elena Kulagina.
Vainonen's culminating gift to Masha is the great pas de deux, which he
turns into a display of pyrotechnics by giving the ballerina five cavaliers
who throw and catch her in bravura fashion. (It is a fascinating period
piece in evoking the acrobatic manner favoured in Soviet ballet during the
1930s). Kulagina, gleaming, effortless, is a delightful exponent of its
manner.
Her chief cavalier, Vitaly Poleshchuk, is clean in style, elegant. The
divertissements of the second act show that the Perm company has lively
soloists: I hope we shall see them again in a more searching repertory. The
score is recorded, and well-played by an excellent but un-named orchestra.
As a most intriguing sidelight on Nutcracker, Derngate has brought over a
small exhibition of designs for this ballet from the archives of the Bolshoi
Theatre. Some 60 costume designs are on view, by Konstantin Korovin for the
Bolshoi's 1919 production by Gorsky, and by Vladimir Dimitriev for Asaf
Messerer's 1939 staging. They are fascinating, important.
The Nutcracker at Derngate Theatre, Northampton, until December 11.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: George Michael - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pop stars, naive sweeties that they are, still believe that the 1990s is the
caring decade. Many of them seem to have abandoned their careers in favour
of charity fund raising and Aids is the cause closest to their hearts. So
goodwill, sentiment, love and peace, and an overwhelming atmosphere of
self-righteousness, temporarily converted Wembley Arena into the ark of the
new covenant on Wednesday night.
George Michael had organised a Concert of Hope, and the Princess of Wales
was there. She received the sort of reception usually reserved for U2, but
did not join Michael in the Wham Rap. She deservedly let him pick up the
laurels.
Michael is in an odd sort of limbo at the moment. He is in a well publicised
legal dispute with Sony, his record company, which he accuses of inhibiting
his creative development. He wants artistic respect; they want a mega pop
star. So occasions like the Concert of Hope are his best, if not only,
opportunity to touch his fans.
They loved him. There were few signs of the higher seriousness. He still
manages a three-day growth of beard; he still wiggles his hips like Cliff
Richard in 1960. He hardly needed to give a twitch to get the audience to
stand and stomp and clap him through his newly adopted theme tune, one which
he might share with the Princess, 'Freedom'.
But the emphasis is on the voice. Michael sings now with the fullest
throttle and he has a weakness for the big ballad, like 'Love's in need of
love today'. On the oval stage, set in the heart of the arena, he showed no
signs of rustiness; it was a dominating, assured performance, culminating in
an extended 'Everything she wants'.
Michael was very much the ring master of his three star circus. His two
supporting stars were Mick Hucknall, of Simply Red, and kd lang. I'm worried
about Ms lang. I loved her when she was a Canadian cowgirl, with a feel for
the sentimental ballads of the 1940s, a kind of spunky Garrison Keillor. I
was even charmed by the modesty of a lower-cased name. Now success has
turned her into an unstoppable torch singer, swathed in layers of white
sheeting and stomping around the stage fighting an unsubtle sound system.
She is just plain old Karen Lang, the cabaret circuit queen.
But Hucknall delivered in spades. He really is honey-voiced and he gave the
audience what it craved, a string of hits, including the modern classic
'Stars'. He caught the easy-going, celebratory, uncritical mood of the
occasion. The MC was a restrained David Bowie, acting as the voice of
conscience on an escapist evening.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: Sawallisch's Strauss - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday the London Philharmonic had Wolfgang Sawallisch again as their
conductor, in the Royal Festival Hall. He is 70 now, and one of the last
masters of his generation: infinitely knowledgeable about the Austro-German
repertoire, hugely skilled at making his orchestras understand what he wants
and play up to it. We should treasure Sawallisch.
The LPO played Strauss's auto-celebratory Symphonia Domestica for him. It is
the composer's most unnecessary big work. It came at the fag-end of his
'symphonic poems', in 1903 - even before the Salome which turned him into an
opera-composer for the remaining half of his long life. Enthusiasts praise
the intricacy of its counterpoint: all those marital and familial
Leitmotiven so forcibly welded together, in opulent orchestral dress.
But the original model was surely the three-tunes conjunction in Wagner's
Meistersinger Overture - the Mastersingers, the Prize Song and the
Apprentices all at once. (Having read the programme-notes, we pride
ourselves upon noticing that.) Liszt's reaction to it was scathingly honest:
something like 'Ah, so you're doing counterpoint then]' There is a great gap
between that kind of conscious exercise, like Strauss's Symphonia, and (say)
the vital, fluent interplay of parts in Tristan.
On the other hand, every musical element in the Symphonia boasts Strauss's
hallmark. If there is something factitious about the 'symphonism', his
ubiquitous personality is vivid and real as could be. Sawallisch has always
struck me as a pragmatic, intelligently sceptical interpreter, disinclined
to attach weight to anything but what is actually embedded in the notes.
Here, he captured the lusty colours and the just emphases for every moment
in the inflated score; the result was transparent far beyond the norm,
superbly controlled and grandly disarming.
Earlier, he introduced us to Werner Egk's 1949 'French Suite after Rameau',
which few of us will ever hear again. Its five movements are bright,
angular, quirky fantasies on harpsichord pieces by Rameau: some dissonant
birdsong, a jack-booted Gigue, a smoochy elaboration of 'Les tendres
Plaintes'. They fairly breathe their sweet-and-sour postwar period, which
Sawallisch must know through and through. From 30-odd years ago I retain
friendly memories of Egk's Die Verlobung in San Domingo a Latin-American
film noir piece, and hope that the ENO may one of these days try it on.
In Bruch's celebrated G minor violin concerto - period stuff - Sawallisch
supplied a faultlessly sympathetic accompaniment for young Leonidas Kavakos,
replacing the phenomenal Maxim Vengerov. (That still-younger Siberian
emigrated a few years ago to Israel, and has been called up for his National
Service there; we must hope that he does not hurt a finger or a wrist, for
he is irreplaceable.) No invidious comparisons: the Kavakos technique was
equal to every demand, and his plain, open sincerity shone where more
seasoned and cynical violinists resort to flashy tricks-of-the-trade. We
shall hear much more of him.

The children featured in 'Sheriff Street Kids', today's documentary in C4's
Short Stories series, are the sort who have grown up with truancy and car
theft as major parts of their lives. They live in a run-down area of central
Dublin and dote on racing pigeons. The programme follows two boys, Madser
and Docker, as they prepare to race their birds from Bray to Sheriff Street
(8.00).
ITV begins a three-part drama, All Or Nothing At All, in which comedian Hugh
Laurie plays a charming City con man, addicted to gambling. He risks his
friends' money on the horses in an attempt to make them a lot of money and
therefore, as he supposes, happy (9.00).
In Bottom, being repeated on BBC2, Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall play
characters not far removed from their roles in The Young Ones. This will not
be to everyone's taste, but if you do happen to enjoy their
pee-po-belly-bum-drawers routine this is the most vigorous example yet to
reach the screen. Today's episode with Rik's birthday party is like a
pantomime with which Joe Orton has been interfering (9.00).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Blackburn Rovers' manager Kenny Dalglish must be glad that he is running
multi-millionaire Jack Walker's pet football team and not his regional
airline - Jersey European Airways - which is having its third shake-up in
less than five years.
Barry Perrott, 44, has replaced Trefor Jones, a former pilot, as managing
director of JEA and group managing director of its parent, Walker Aviation.
Perrott joined JEA just over a year ago as planning director after 25 years
with British Airways. Jones had joined JEA two years ago and is a former
president of the European Regional Airlines Association. Michael Robinson,
JEA's financial director, is also being replaced.
JEA, which describes itself as Britain's leading independent regional
airline, declined to elaborate on the reasons for the management changes.
JEA has a fleet of 16 aircraft and 360 staff; it serves 13 destinations and
has been leading the fight for lower fares on the routes between Belfast and
the mainland.
Despite its name, its route network has expanded well beyond the Channel
Islands. However, it is facing growing competition on some of its routes and
Jack Walker, whose fortune has been estimated at Pounds 320m, will be
conscious that owning a rapidly growing airline can be even more expensive
than owning a premier league football club.

BAA, the former British Airports Authority, has appointed an airline man to
the post of managing director of Heathrow Express, the planned fast rail
link between Heathrow and Paddington in west London.
Rod Hoare is currently managing director of British Airways Regional, a
Pounds 300m business, and has responsibility for the direct flights from
Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland.
Construction has already begun on the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express project,
a joint venture between BAA, which owns 70 per cent and British Rail, with
30 per cent.
Hoare says his main tasks will be to see that the project is completed on
time and within cost and to ensure that the trains are built to a high
standard. The new service is intended to reduce the journey time from the
airport to Paddington to just 16 minutes from 1997.
Hoare began his career with BOAC, the precursor of BA, spending 16 years
with the airline. He was area manager for Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon
when the Lebanese civil war broke out in the mid-1970s. He was the last BA
expat to leave Beirut when he was finally forced to shut the office and move
to Jordan and was subsequently awarded the MBE for services to the British
community in Lebanon.
He left BA to become chief executive at Sally Line, a ferry operator, and
then moved to Pandair, the air freight subsidiary of P&amp;O. He then became
director of ground operations for British Caledonian, the airline acquired
by BA in 1988.
A fan of Italian opera, Hoare recalls that Verdi's Aida was commissioned to
mark the opening of the Suez canal. As far as he knows there are as yet no
plans for an opera to commemorate the launch of the Heathrow Express.

Clocking in and clocking out can be expensive because the paper time cards
have to be continually replaced. But electronic time recording systems have
often only been available economically to larger companies.
French manufacturer Bodet has eliminated time cards in its BT50 system which
is intended for companies with as few as 20 employees. The BT50 uses
personal badges, each containing a magnetic stripe. These are swiped through
the machine like a credit card. The electronic data gathered by the machines
can be sent directly to a personal computer.
There the information can be used in conjunction with payroll software to
calculate wages. Bodet: France, 41 71 72 00; UK, 0442 234141.

Parents offer surprisingly little guidance to their children over the types
of computer games they play, according to a study by Aston University for
Elspa, the European Leisure Software Publisher's Association.
According to the study only 3 per cent of children reported any parental
guidance regarding the type of games they played, compared with 58 per cent
who reported that their parents determined the type of television programmes
they watched. However, the report showed parents were keen to restrict the
time their children play computer games. Elspa: UK, 0386 830642.

FT  03 DEC 93 / People: Gateway loses finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gateway Group, the supermarket business still struggling under the debt from
the Isosceles leveraged buy-out in 1989, has found a new finance director.
Martin Gatto, 43, was headhunted from the private and secretive Sun
International leisure group, where he was chief financial officer.
As a consequence of his appointment, Gateway coyly says 'Geoff Cooper, the
current group finance director, will be leaving Gateway'. He will not go
empty-handed, as the quiz show host might say. With a three-year rolling
contract he is expected to pick up decent compensation, although terms have
yet to be fixed.
The parting seems to have been amicable; David Simons, chief executive since
January, has now 'completed his management team'. Cooper joined Gateway in
1990, under David Smith who led the LBO.
Gateway has also found some non-executive directors. They are David
Thornham, managing director of Midland Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking -
Midland Bank organised the group's financial restructuring in June; Peter
Nevitt, president of Mitsui Nevitt Capital Corporation, a 5.4 per cent
shareholder in Isosceles; and Alan Giles, managing director of Waterstones
Booksellers.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Technology: Uniformity on the high seas - Cost-conscious oil
companies are moving from bespoke platforms to standard designs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Sea oil and gas production platforms, some of the biggest and most
expensive structures ever built, are rarely thought of as architectural
jewels. Yet each is custom-designed and built to a bespoke set of
specifications, detailing everything from steel strength to the exact power
output for the gas turbines that provide enough electricity to supply whole
towns.
In an age of standardisation they are the industrial equivalents of racing
cars, with the focus on performance and little thought given to cost. Their
designers have pushed technology to suit the harsh operating environment;
which is why the basic above-sea structure of North Sea platforms can cost
four times that of similar ones in the Gulf of Mexico, while materials and
equipment can cost 70 per cent more.
The need for massive amounts of documentation to accompany individual
designs and excessive technical requirements results in a 25 per cent cost
penalty, say industry experts. The high cost of customisation, however, has
been of secondary importance to arriving at the most perfect technical
solution to the twin priorities of withstanding the rigours of the North Sea
for up to 20 years and efficiently draining individual oil fields.
But the era of spending more than Pounds 1.5bn on individual North Sea
platforms may soon be over. The prospect of finding more of the very large
fields which could justify such investments is fading. Tax changes earlier
this year removed the fiscal incentive to maximise production through
customisation.
In addition, the outlook is for oil prices to remain relatively low for some
years, while cost-cutting is seen as the key to the future profitability of
big oil companies.
But a shift away from tailor-made technological solutions to standardisation
will not be easy. 'There is a cultural, historical prejudice' against
standardisation in the industry, according to Rex Gaisford, director of
projects at Amerada Hess, the US-based company which accounts for about a
tenth of UK North Sea production.
Just how strong that prejudice remains is being tested this week as the
Crine Committee, an industry-wide study group under the aegis of the UK
Offshore Operators Association (Ukooa), unveiled its proposals for a
fundamental overhaul of the way in which big offshore engineering projects
are undertaken.
Ukooa, whose 36 member companies participated in the 'cost reduction in the
new era', or Crine initiative, believes savings of up to 30 per cent in
capital costs could be made within two to three years if the basic proposals
were implemented.
Such cost reductions, however, can only be realised if changes are made in
the relationship between the oil companies and their main engineering
contractors. Given that in each of the last 20 years the offshore oil and
gas industry accounted for as much as a quarter of the total capital
investment in UK producing industries, the impact of the Crine initiative
could be felt across the industrial sector.
The main proposals centre around a series of codes, practices and
specifications for machinery. Gaisford, who headed one of the main Crine
committees, hopes that agreement on them will give suppliers the confidence
to develop standard North Sea products, rather than wait for the 'mountain
of paper' which currently accompanies the order for a new bespoke platform.
Simplification of contract language and the elimination of 'adversarial
clauses' would give contractors more confidence that operators 'would not
just stand back and throw rocks at them if they get it wrong', according to
Gaisford.
He also believes that such an approach would lead to greater technological
innovation in the offshore industry. 'Standardisation in other industries,
like car manufacturing, has led suppliers to invest in the most promising
technology,' he says. In addition, 'new technology would come in on a far
more rational basis' than the almost haphazard way in which it is currently
introduced.
Safety, too, would be enhanced by a move towards standardisation, because
reliability would improve. 'It's the same as if you designed and built your
own car to meet your family's specific needs,' says Gaisford. 'It's bound to
be less reliable' than a standard product.
Amerada Hess' Scott platform, which is in its final assembly phase 130 miles
off Aberdeen, may be one of the last of the big North Sea platforms built
under the prevailing design philosophy. The large reservoir dictated a big
platform, although Amerada was keen to try out new concepts which may point
to future standard practices.
Seven sub-sea wells were drilled to ensure that oil and revenues could flow
as soon as Scott was commissioned. The platform was built on a 'fast track',
with individual production modules weighing up to 10,000 tons assembled and
commissioned on shore to save time and money. They were then lifted into
place by giant crane barges.
Such techniques are increasingly common in the cost-conscious industry. But
Amerada Hess' request for three off-the-shelf power generation turbines
suitable for North Sea operations caught European Gas Turbines, a GEC
subsidy, by surprise. It is, however, introducing a North Sea package, built
around a standard product to which options can be attached, a development
which the Crine initiative would encourage.
But would implementation of Crine recommendations lead to a radically
different way of approaching a similar project in the future? Gaisford says
that a combination of Crine measures and other innovations could cut by half
the size of a Scott-type of platform built 10 years from now.
Ships capable of drilling, producing and storing oil, while maintaining
precise positions through satellite navigation and a series of
computer-controlled propellers along the hull are only now making their
appearance in the North Sea. But their presence in greater numbers will
allow the removal of the large drilling units now located on platforms such
as Scott. For some of the smaller fields it may even be possible to order a
standard platform and equipment package.
The big task is not technical, according to Gaisford. 'Crine represents a
huge cultural change. Some people and companies will be left behind.'
Changing the attitude of oil industry engineers could prove to have much in
common with stopping a fully-laden supertanker travelling at speed. It takes
a little thought and a lot of time.

FT  03 DEC 93 / People: Winckler: supervision at SIB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Winckler, who helped found boutique merchant bank European Capital
Company in 1990, has been persuaded to head the supervision division of the
Securities and Investments Board for a three-year term.
Winckler, 44, who confesses that it never crossed his mind that he might be
a candidate for the new job, says he made the 'fairly agonising decision'
because he thought it was 'a very important job from the City's point of
view'. He goes on to the SIB board as an executive director alongside
chairman Andrew Large and chief executive John Young.
He says the ECC board has given him 'leave of absence' and he resigns as a
director. It is understood that SIB had been keen to make the appointment a
five-year term.
Nor will he join until March next year, giving him time to disengage from
ECC, where he has worked on the corporate advisory side, recently being
involved with the water industry and its periodic review. He says that ECC
has been profitable for the past two years, and achieved in three years the
modest targets set out for the first five, but he says it was not the
earnings aspect that complicated his decision to cross the fence.
SIB, fighting to restore its credibility after the Maxwell scandal, has in
Winckler a market practitioner who also knows Whitehall from the inside.
After 12 years at the Treasury, three of which were spent on secondment to
the diplomatic service in Washington, he moved in 1982 to Lloyds Bank
International, and from there to Security Pacific Hoare Govett as an
executive director responsible, among other things, for debt and swaps
origination.
Deputy chairman of The Securities Association (TSA), which in 1991 became
the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), Winckler lost out in an election
to Christopher Sharples, who became chairman of the new entity. Winckler
remained SFA's deputy chairman.
In August, SIB announced the creation of four new divisions, including
supervision, central to Large's review 'Making the two-tier system work'.
Winckler will have responsibility for the 'front-line' regulators, including
the exchanges and for the professional bodies, and will have a staff of 50.
SIB has also restructured its board, appointing Lord Alexander, chairman of
National Westminster Bank, as its deputy chairman. Other new members are
Rosalind Gilmore, chairman of the Building Societies Commission; John
Kennedy, senior partner of Allen &amp; Overy; Oonagh McDonald, management
consultant; and Lord Stewartby, deputy chairman of Standard Chartered.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Management: A new world that may be some time coming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prophets have seldom been popular. Since time immemorial, they have foretold
change to audiences usually comfortable with the status quo. Modern seers
tend to compound the problem by using language which obfuscates their
message, so that its full significance takes time to be deciphered.
Take Shoshana Zuboff. Five years ago, after studying in great depth the very
varied human impact of information technology in American companies, she
published a book called In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work
and Power. It argued that the competitive potential of IT would only be
achieved if the knowledge and muscle which it can provide is shared with
front-line employees, rather than guarded jealously by the traditional
management hierarchy.
In 1988 the business world was not yet ready for Zuboff's message. Her book
had a remarkable influence on populists such as Tom Peters and on her fellow
academics at Harvard and elsewhere; one leading professor, who teaches in a
different field, said her work was the most influential to come out of
Harvard since the early 1980s. Robert Reich, now the US labour secretary,
called it 'pathbreaking'.
But several obstacles stood in her way. The first was of her own making. The
book was tough going, even for IT buffs and students of organisational
behaviour. It was full of impenetrable concepts drawn from anthropology,
sociology, psychology and philosophy, and riddled with terms such as
'imperative control' and 'intellective skills'. Its leitmotif was equally
inelegant: that companies were doing themselves and their staff a disservice
by using IT to automate front-line tasks, rather than to 'informate' them.
The second barrier was that her message seemed overstated: at the time, many
companies were still investing hell-for-leather in costly computer
technology; the penny was only just starting to drop that, for IT to pay
off, it was no good automating inefficient and outdated processes. Another
two years went by before Michael Hammer, who has since become one of the
chief prophets of re-engineering, hit an increasingly raw nerve with a
Harvard Business Review article called Don't Automate, Obliterate. With
recession starting to bite, his timing was far better than hers.
Third, most of Zuboff's message in 1988 was extremely threatening to an
executive world still wedded to the traditional management style of
unvarying command and control and to the idea that automation was a
substitute for employees' skills, no matter how drudge-like it made their
jobs.
At the time she was branded as a subversive for her argument that, if the
capability of cheap IT was to be used to full commercial effect, then much
of the information it provides must be handed to the front line.
Yet this is just what has started to happen since 1990 at a growing number
of companies, under the combined influence of recession, fast-moving
competition from global rivals and pressure for higher white-collar
productivity.
From self-managed teams at Motorola, General Electric and other US
corporations, to the learning culture that now permeates the Rover car group
in Britain, companies are finding that shallow organisation structures, with
front-line workers who are both responsive and responsible - are empowered -
have become vital to their competitiveness.
So Zuboff's time is drawing near - even if many managers are still resisting
her message. Fortunately, she has become far better at conveying it in plain
 -well, plainish - language, as she showed last month at an Economist
conference on The Organisation of the 21st Century.
Every previous generation of technology had simplified work, she argued:
complexity had been removed from the front line and passed upward, for newly
created levels of management to handle. But now IT was reversing this
centuries-old process.
Instead of resisting, she urged any enterprise trying to operate fast and
flexibly against hyper-competition to welcome this challenge. No company
could now afford the time or cost involved in shooting information up its
organisation, she said. It must be allowed to flow better, both vertically
and across the organisation. This meant most employees must become, to some
degree, managerial.
Like any evangelist, Zuboff overstates. By no means all front-line work can
be rejuvenated by being reinvested with information content and complexity,
as she puts it - nor would every employee welcome that. From assembling
electronic products to working at a retail check-out, what she calls 'dumb'
jobs will continue to exist, even if they are aided further by IT.
Nor is empowerment always the promised land which she and others claim. As a
senior banker muttered loudly at the conference, 'most examples of
empowerment in Britain have been about shafting employees - dumping our
problems on them, and expecting them to do six hours' extra work a day'.
The answer is not merely, as the banker suggested, to agree clear levels of
responsibility, resources and authority. As GE has shown, two other measures
are also needed: many work processes must be redesigned, so that all
needless steps are removed; and employees must be given as much freedom as
possible to decide how to achieve their agreed objectives.
Such freedom will always be relative, depending on the task involved. GE's
dishwasher sales staff can be given more latitude than its aero engine
inspectors.
Regardless of the circumstances of each case, Zuboff is right in arguing
that some redistribution of authority is needed if her 'informated' world is
to materialise. That's why it may still be some time coming.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Management: A dressing down - SBC's approach to business
attire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traders and other employees at Swiss Bank Corporation's London office have
been actively encouraged to dress 'smart casual' if they prefer it to
business attire. The relaxation of the dress code was spelt out in a
memorandum to certain staff last month.
The new rules only apply within the office; suits are still de rigueur for
meetings with clients.
The relaxed look is intended to signal change at SBC, albeit surreptitiously
 -there was no public announcement.
'It was an attempt to give visibility to deeper cultural changes,' explains
Rudi Bogni, SBC's London chief executive. 'It's predominantly for internal
purposes, but it's not a secret.
'We do want to project an image that we are sound but open to innovation.'
While the move raises the intriguing question of whether other formerly
staid City employers will follow its lead, it should be stressed that SBC's
shift arose from a unique set of 'corporate culture' circumstances.
It was stimulated by SBC's phased acquisition of derivatives broker O'Connor
Partnership of Chicago where jeans and trainers have been the norm among a
staff influenced as much by Silicon Valley as Wall Street. O'Connor staff
have close links with the academic world.
The relaxed dress code might not have come if O'Connor had been a
buttoned-up New York company, nor if it had been a British or German firm
making the acquisition. 'The main trigger is our multi-cultural manpower,'
says Bogni, an Italian.
'We have to try to create a culture of our own which blends the values.
Dress code is not the major component, but it is a visible one that people
identify with.'
One influence is the growing number of graduates with degrees in mathematics
and physics being attracted to the financial sector. Their role models are
the software geniuses of California, not 1980s sharp suits and braces.
This fashion is drifting eastwards across the US. Many US offices now have
'casual Fridays'.
Europe has yet to catch the trend. SBC claims it is the first City bank to
unbutton, although ABN Amro Bank in Amsterdam has a similarly casual
attitude.
The principal underlying change that SBC aims to make, and which the new
dress is intended to signify, is to integrate its cash and derivatives sides
more closely, fusing greater communications between the two activities and
encouraging a greater exchange of ideas. At a more subliminal level, it is
about being seen to be different by competitors, clients and potential
employees.
The internal memorandum spoke of the move to 'smart casual wear at the
discretion of the individual' as one ingredient of a 'redefinition intended
to strengthen our positive image and to distinguish us from other houses'.
Meanwhile, there are some unexpected benefits of the new policy. Those who
used to preen in expensive tailored suits now look most casual, while some
of those who never appeared comfortable in a business suit now appear
smarter than ever.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Management: Coping with a high fertility index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maternity leave is one of the hottest issues at RCI Europe, a US-owned
company struggling to cope with its own baby boom.
RCI Europe, which acts as an administrative centre handling calls from
timeshare holiday apartment owners seeking to swap their holidays, has grown
rapidly in the past five years, creating 500 new jobs at the administrative
headquarters in Kettering. Most of these, however, went to single women in
their 20s, many of whom have since found partners and started families.
According to Diane Taylor, head of human resources, the company has a 'high
fertility index'. Women account for 78 per cent of the 500 staff and their
average age is 28.
'Five per cent of the workforce are taking maternity leave this year or
next. That's a large percentage for a medium-sized company such as ours to
cope with,' she says.
Taylor is examining ways to retain and help women who take maternity leave.
Job-sharing has been introduced into a flexible shift system at the company.
Taking a positive approach to maternity leave, says Taylor, has helped the
company reach arrangements that have proved acceptable both to employees and
management. 'We place a great emphasis on training and do not want to lose
experienced staff,' she says.
The company will conduct a cost benefit analysis next year to examine how
training costs relate to the costs to the company of maternity leave.
Taylor says the company is filling the maternity leave vacancies by
assigning people from other parts of the UK company and from other offices
of the US-based parent. In the publication department, where linguistic
skills are important, two secondees are being drawn from overseas offices.
'This gives them the opportunity to broaden their experience within the
company,' she says.
Where a temporary managerial vacancy occurred, an employee at a lower level
in the company is given the opportunity to fill the post temporarily as part
of their work experience. Temporary staff will be engaged to fill some of
the lower-level posts.
Andrea Quick, 31, manager of the membership marketing department, plans to
return part time after the birth of her child. 'I realise I will not be
coming back to my current job because that demands a full-time commitment
and is not suitable for job sharing,' she says. Sue Nimmo, an analyst who
works at the company's holiday bank, has just returned to work after
maternity leave. 'Economic circumstances mean that a lot of mothers are
returning to work earlier than they might have done,' she says.
Adds Malcolm Hewitt, managing director of RCI UK, also based at Kettering:
'Working in this area is complex for managers, but managers in the 1990s
have to get used to complexity and have to deal with it in a positive way.'
He suggests that service companies are adapting to changing working
practices more readily than traditional industries where old ideas and
prejudices persist.
Staff on maternity leave are informed of company developments by
newsletters. Next year the company plans to introduce a company network
group so that mothers can share their experiences with expectant mothers.
Meanwhile the company plans a booklet called 'Childbirth without tears,'
with advice and the names and addresses of child carers.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Property: Strategy for success - The property market can
play a part in reviving UK plc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER JONAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a UK Budget which has largely pleased the City and industry, the
R-word is now for 'recovery' rather than recession. Yet in spite of
chancellor Kenneth Clarke's cautiously optimistic prognosis for an improving
British economy over the long-term, some commentators continue to focus on
short-term indicators and appear incapable of looking beyond the next few
months. So keen is the search for economic confidence boosters after the
deepest recession in 60 years, that policymakers are overlooking the need to
build on the Budget with a strategy for increasing the UK's earning capacity
abroad.
To create long-term confidence in the economy, we need to create a clearer
vision of Britain's potential role in world markets. In short to identify
the UK's competitive advantages and then to plug them hard. Leading property
companies need to be clear too on the role which the sector can and should
play in this strategy.
Much of the UK's industrial structure is still based around the country's
strengths built up at the time of the industrial revolution more than a
century ago. The emergence in the past decade of competitors in the
previously undeveloped south-east Asia region is now threatening both UK and
other developed economies. Yet the UK appears content to carry on
undeterred. The business community expects and requires much more than this.
It is time for a fundamental analysis of the UK's economic future. Over the
next generation the pattern of world trade will change with the emergence of
trading blocs in Europe, the Americas and south-east Asia. Yet there seems
to be no sign that UK plc is approaching this challenge in a systematic way.
As Britain's industrial infrastructure ages, the case for a revamped
industrial strategy is fast becoming overwhelming.
For instance, in terms of infrastructure, few people today express any pride
in the UK's record on transport planning or land use. Billions of pounds
have been spent on regenerating cities, but always in a fragmented way.
Success in attracting funds for urban renewal is as much a function of the
negotiating muscle of one urban development corporation versus another,
rather than the result of a coherent market-related strategy.
The UK lacks an overall plan for the efficient use of its infrastructure.
Compared with France, it has been made to look second-rate in the way it has
approached the Channel tunnel rail link. Who could have even countenanced
encouraging by way of tax relief the development of London Docklands without
first ensuring that public transport would be installed to serve the area?
Why does there seem to be a resistance to our integrating land use and
transport planning at the highest level?
Britain is now spending Pounds 50bn more than it earns each year. In the
circumstances, it needs a clearer set of priorities for public expenditure.
The only way to achieve this is to formulate a firm set of economic and
social objectives, which must encompass the efficient use of the country's
vast real estate assets.
Is it not time, for instance, to challenge the policy of always trying to
rejuvenate old city centres, when the economic demand for the land and local
labour has moved on? When Britain led the industrial revolution, new
industries were sited close to factors of production. To take an extreme
example, the country did not require the new industries of, say, Tyneside in
north-east England to relocate to the Lincolnshire fens just because of
falling demand for the agricultural skills of the people in the fens. Today,
industry must be allowed to locate where it can prosper. Otherwise the UK
will lose industry to European countries which better understand its needs.
Much of the UK's present policy on urban regeneration is not about
regeneration at all. It is more about redevelopment. This policy is based on
the presumption that if you build on derelict land, you will attract
tenants, create employment and regenerate an urban area.
But this approach is flawed. The demand for land over time is dictated by
the willingness of people to work or to live on it. Britain's most
magnificent cities prospered because they were able to attract companies on
the basis of a compelling economic argument. The buildings constructed
during the industrial revolution which conservationists are today trying to
preserve, were built only because they were judged to be an asset in
contributing to the local economy.
Today, the government's grants regime can certainly help persuade companies
to relocate to particular cities. But if there is no long-term, unsubsidised
demand the initial and subsequent grants will amount to throwing public
money down the drain.
The distribution of population and buildings in Britain reflects the pattern
of industrial development of the 19th century. It was a time when labour was
cheap and Britain's empire gave it access to plentiful and cheap raw
materials.
Today, competition in world markets is different. The UK's imperial heritage
does not earn it kudos in the eyes of its competitors other than when they
visit the country as tourists. The UK cannot expect industry to expand in
the absence of the right infrastructure. Failure to provide this would force
industry to flee abroad.
It is not surprising, given the UK's head start in the industrial age, that
it has allowed itself to drift. Britain has been enjoying the fruits of past
investments, without ploughing more back to provide for future generations.
And while the country has slumbered in its complacency, much more aggressive
competitors have emerged to pinch its traditional markets.
No business would survive its shareholders' wrath if it failed in its duty
to compete effectively. Similarly, no management would be allowed to muddle
along in world markets without a clear strategy on how best to capitalise on
its competitive advantages. We must devise a forum and a format in which
those interested can create just such a plan for UK plc. Those of us in the
property market must be at the first meeting and play our full part in its
future.

FT  03 DEC 93 / British stance will disappoint Reynolds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Statements by the prime minister and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern
Ireland secretary, rejecting the notion of their being 'persuaders for a
united Ireland' will be a bitter disappointment to Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish prime minister.
Mr Reynolds' proposals for a 'united Ireland by consent', and active British
involvement in that aim, are central to the peace formula that he intends to
discuss with Mr Major in Dublin today.
Although Dublin officials were yesterday emphasising that they still hoped
for progress, the statements cast further gloom on Mr Reynolds' aspirations
for 'peace by Christmas'.
One of the main concessions Mr Reynolds seeks is is a statement by London
supporting 'self determination of the Irish people based on consent freely
expressed, north and south'. This would guarantee a majority veto in
Northern Ireland to any change, but would also give nationalists the
satisfaction of an all-Ireland dimension.
Like London, Dublin is convinced that the IRA is ready to end its military
campaign. But it is convinced that Britain will have to do more than simply
demand a unilateral republican ceasefire.
A clue as to why Dublin has such faith in its formula lies in a recent
speech by Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, who said: 'Partition was
brought about by a British act of parliament for which not a single Irish
vote was cast. The consent of the Irish people was never sought and has
never been freely given. That is the nub of our problems.'
Dublin officials have made little effort in the past week to disguise their
exasperation with Downing Street and their concern that Mr Major's
'understanding' with the Ulster Unionists is the main obstacle to progress
on their own formula.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Dounreay rocket site mooted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dounreay nuclear plant on the north coast of Scotland is considering
whether to become a site for launching space rockets to put communications
satellites into orbit.
AEA Technology, the offshoot of the UK Atomic Energy Agency which operates
the plant, will decide early in the new year whether to carry out a
full-scale feasibility study of the launch site proposal.
Dounreay, where the experimental fast-breeder reactor is to close next year,
could be suitable for launching small rockets carrying satellites into polar
orbits, which circle the earth passing over the poles.
A requisite for polar orbit launches is to be able to launch missiles over
the sea in a northerly direction. Dounreay's position on the north coast of
Caithness is ideal.
Western Europe has no commercial space rocket launch site. The European
Space Agency launches its Ariane space rockets from French Guyana in South
America.
Dounreay believes there is a need for sites from which to put small
communications satellites into polar orbit, as opposed to orbit around the
Equator. Both Norway and Canada are considering developing launch sites.
Dounreay said the scheme was in its early stages but AEA Technology is
understood to have had preliminary talks with potential partners. To go
ahead the project would need to be commercially viable and would need the
support of the local community. It would probably employ scores rather than
hundreds of people at the start.
Dounreay is seeking ways to reduce its dependence on the nuclear industry.
The plant is shedding staff, with 240 of its 1,400 jobs due to go in April.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Companies fear effects of tax rises: Poll reveals concern
that Budget will fail to speed up recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impact of Budget tax increases on consumer spending could undermine the
accompanying measures intended to help businesses recover from the
recession, according to an opinion poll among companies.
Two-thirds of 150 companies surveyed this week fear that the combined impact
of extra taxes announced earlier this year and those announced on Tuesday
will hold back spending in the shops.
The survey was carried out by NOP for the finance house Lombard North
Central among companies in the manufacturing, construction, transport and
distribution and service industries.
The results show that the business community believes Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, delivered a politically skilful Budget that should be good for
business in general. But there remain widespread reservations about its
likely effectiveness.
Nearly half of the companies surveyed consider the Budget has provided the
basis for continuing economic recovery, but almost exactly the same
proportion believe it will not have provided any additional stimulus.
Opinions are divided as to whether the Budget will help pave the way for any
further, early reductions in interest rates, which are still seen as key to
helping speed the recovery.
Neither do companies believe that the chancellor's measures - including
improved export credit insurance cover and a cut in the cost of some
premiums - will do much to help the export drive. Forty-five per cent of
companies believe he should have done more.
The chancellor will also be disappointed if he expected the Budget to give
companies more confidence to step up sluggish spending programmes.
Nearly a third of companies said that they were more optimistic about the
outlook for investment within their own businesses after the Budget, but
almost half said it would make no difference.
Half of the companies in the transport and distribution sector, hit by
higher excise and fuel duties, said they were now even more pessimistic on
prospects for investment.
Not surprisingly, business regards the Budget measures as being principally
directed towards smaller companies. There is widespread approval of the
proposed new apprenticeship scheme, but a majority of companies are not
convinced the government will give it sufficient resources.

FT  03 DEC 93 / IRA 'set to step up military campaign'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA plans to step up its military campaign if the Dublin talks do not
produce acceptance by London of the principle of self-determination for the
people of all Ireland.
According to republican sources the IRA has been carefully weighing up its
military and political options in the approach to the meeting of the two
prime ministers today.
The IRA is convinced that any ceasefire in the present circumstances -
whether official or not - risks undermining the efficiency of the
organisation.
A republican source said: 'Like in any army the fear is that a period of
inactivity undermines morale. It also provides the space for an examination
of conscience.'
It is widely suspected in the IRA that previous extended ceasefires were
used by the security forces to infiltrate the organisation.
The IRA is still officially backing the peace process and Sinn Fein, its
political wing, has been stepping up its distribution of posters backing the
Hume-Adams initiative.
Although details of this have not been released, the initiative aims to
bring about a permanent cessation of IRA activities as part of a
comprehensive political settlement for Northern Ireland, including a
constitutional shift of the kind for which Dublin appears to be pressing.
The IRA had scaled down its operations until this week to facilitate the
possibility that the heart of the Hume-Adams proposals might be absorbed by
the Anglo-Irish peace talks.
With the resumption of attacks on soft targets - yesterday's murder of a
British soldier, a failed bomb attack on an army patrol and a bomb attack on
an RUC policeman - the IRA has signalled an internal decision to keep up the
pressure on the British government as it attempts to appease Unionist
opinion.
The resumption of still relatively low-scale IRA military operations has
come against a background of outrage by the republican movement at the
government's claim that the IRA had come to it declaring that the conflict
was over and asking for advice on how to give up its military campaign.
Another republican source said: 'Anyone who knows the IRA and those close to
it knows that the suggestion that Martin McGuinness would send such a
message to the government is prepos-terous.'
Supporters of the IRA in the Catholic community admit that in the aftermath
of the Shankill and Derry killings last month a feeling of war-weariness is
setting in. But there is no indication that they expect the IRA leadership
unilaterally to declare a ceasefire in the absence of any palpable political
gains.
The IRA's own military 'volunteers' are strongly resistant to any deal with
the British government that might smack of surrender.
So far there is no evidence of any substantial division between hawks and
doves in the republican movement over the suitability of conducting contacts
with the government either directly or through intermediaries.
In the approach to Christmas, however, a continuing political debate over
tactics and strategy is likely to intensify in the IRA and Sinn Fein.
In recent years the IRA's traditional three-to-four-day ceasefire
immediately before and after Christmas Day has become a matter of routine,
with terrorist activity resuming almost immediately afterwards.
But in the charged and complex current circumstances, with much at stake,
any decision on a ceasefire by the IRA is likely to have considerable
political significance.
The only certainty to emerge from the affair over the documents is that the
IRA regards its mix of politics and violence as entirely legitimate and
effective in focusing the minds of governments.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Sinn Fein says cabinet was split on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said yesterday that it had
received highly sensitive information earlier this year about a split in the
British government over its negotiations with the organisation.
Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein official with the closest links to the
IRA, said he had been informed earlier this year that Mr John Major was
forced to defuse a cabinet split over government contacts with nationalists.
According to Mr McGuinness, Mr Major met Sir Patrick Mayhew, Ulster
secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and two civil servants on May
17 to discuss an IRA offer to call a 14-day ceasefire to enable talks to
take place. The next day the group was expanded to include Mr Kenneth
Clarke, then home secretary.
Mr McGuinness claimed that Mr Clarke expressed concern that continuing
dialogue with Sinn Fein was 'too risky with the government under siege'  - a
possible reference to government difficulties ratifying the Maastricht
treaty. By contrast, said Mr McGuinness, Sir Patrick was 'wobbling between
pushing for acceptance and wanting a safer, longer period of cessation'.
Downing Street last night reacted angrily to Mr McGuinness's claims about
the meetings, saying that they were 'inaccurate'. It added that 'all the
quotes are fabricated'. The claims, it said, were an attempt to distract
attention from the fact that Sinn Fein had made the original overtures to
Britain this year.
However, the revelations looked set to further embarrass the government on
the eve of peace talks between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
prime minister.
Sinn Fein further disconcerted the government by saying that it had also
received copies of a briefing paper from the Northern Ireland Office which
summarised talks conducted between Ulster's democratic parties last year
under Sir Ninian Stephens, an Australian judge.
According to the briefing paper, the British were exploring the possibility
of setting up a power sharing assembly in Stormont, creating a series of
cross-border executive agencies and agreeing a constitutional declaration on
Ulster.
The document showed that Sir Ninian had conducted the talks with
constitutional parties between May and November last year.
If this allegation is proved, it would give strength to claims that the
British government has been involved in talks with the Irish nationalists
for more than three years. British officials claimed earlier this week that
Sinn Fein made initial enquiries about talks with the government in
February.

FT  03 DEC 93 / SFO drops charges in Duralite case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office is to continue its prosecution of Mr Malcolm
Johnson, the former owner of the Duralite Manufacturing Company, in spite of
dropping charges against two other men accused of fraud.
Mr Justice Colman ordered the formal acquittal of Mr Mungo Park of Earls
Court, London, and Mr Alex Dann of Kensington, London. The three had been
accused of conspiring to fraudulently induce investments in Duralite by
making misleading statements and other offences. Mr Johnson will now be
prosecuted on two charges of theft relating to a Pounds 1m rights issue.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Pounds 1.7bn of tax written off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of tax written off by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise
has mounted steeply during the recession, according to the National Audit
Office.
The Inland Revenue wrote off Pounds 1.7bn last year, almost double the
figure for 1991. More than three-quarters of the total is accounted for by
insolvency. Customs &amp; Excise wrote off Pounds 825m of value added tax and
customs duties as either remitted or irrecoverable last year, up from Pounds
553m in 1991. Most of this is also because of insolvency.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Treasury to repay Pounds 380,000 lost taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has agreed to pay the Inland Revenue Pounds 380,000 after
financial irregularities by its catering arm involving payments to staff
over 10 years, John Willman writes.
The sum will cover tax and national insurance contributions which should
have been deducted from the pay of casual staff employed by Forward Civil
Service Catering, a Treasury agency. The National Audit Office last year
revealed financial irregularities in the agency, including mismanagement and
fraud.
Sir John Bourn, head of the audit office, says in his report on the
Treasury's 1992-93 accounts that the total loss to public funds could be
Pounds 900,000.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Levitt's QC criticised for prejudicing jury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The barrister who defended Mr Roger Levitt, the financial services salesman
given a community service order after admitting fraud, was criticised by the
trial judge for making a prejudicial speech to the jury, it was disclosed
yesterday.
Criticisms made of Mr Jonathan Goldberg QC during the trial by Mr Justice
Laws were made public yesterday after the Serious Fraud Office won a High
Court ruling to have reporting restrictions lifted on legal arguments which
were held during the trial in the absence of the jury.
The move by the SFO amounts to a further attempt to defend itself following
criticism of its acceptance of the plea bargain which led to Mr Levitt
walking free from court.
It was followed by a statement from Sir Nicholas Lyall, the attorney
general, defending the SFO's handling of the case. Answering a parliamentary
question, he said prosecution of Mr Levitt had been fairly and vigorously
conducted.
He also ruled out any appeal against the sentence on grounds of leniency,
saying it was impossible under the law.
Prosecution sources have indicated that their acceptance of Mr Levitt's plea
to a much-reduced charge of deceiving Fimbra, the self-regulating body for
financial advisers, was largely influenced by the prejudicial speech made by
Mr Goldberg and the subsequent decision by the judge, Mr Justice Laws, not
to order a retrial.
In this speech, outlining the general nature of Mr Levitt's case, Mr
Goldberg said that the means Mr Levitt had used to obtain Pounds 21m he
later injected into his company were totally honest. During the trial it was
alleged Mr Levitt then fraudulently injected this money into the Levitt
Group in a failed attempt to save the company - a claim he still denies.
Most of this money had been obtained by Mr Levitt by raising loans and
selling shares in the group to banks and other institutions. However, while
the jury was absent the court was told that the SFO had always disputed Mr
Levitt's honesty in the way he raised this money.
During pre-trial hearings the judge had resolved the issue by insisting that
both the SFO and Mr Levitt's defence team could put only a neutral
interpretation on how the Pounds 21m was raised. By claiming Mr Levitt had
raised the money honestly, Mr Goldberg had 'gravely misrepresented the true
facts' and subverted this ruling, the judge said.
In spite of agreeing with Mr David Cocks QC, for the SFO, that the speech
had been prejudicial, the judge rejected his call for a re-trial.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Mayhew gives clearer indication of differences with Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave the
clearest public signal so far by a government minister about the nature of
differences between London and Dublin over a constitutional settlement for
Northern Ireland.
He also hinted that the government could be close to proposing the
establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee. Such a move would be
seen as reinforcing the government's commitment to the province's Unionist
majority.
In his second Commons appearance this week Sir Patrick was asked by Mr Kevin
McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary: 'Do you acknowledge the value
of the goal of a united Ireland?'
The question was similar to one in a leaked draft Dublin position paper
which is privately acknowledged to be among the principal sticking-points
over an agreed framework for a settlement.
Sir Patrick's reply - that the government could not 'join the ranks of the
persuaders' - underlined London's unwillingness to back down on the issue.
He said: 'We believe that it should be for the people of Northern Ireland to
determine for themselves without persuasion from us whether they wish to
remain in the UK or no.'
Sir Patrick offered encouragement to supporters of a Northern Ireland select
committee. In a carefully worded answer to Mr John Hume, Social Democratic
and Labour party leader, Sir Patrick said: 'It might be said that there is
some value in having a select committee looking at the affairs of Northern
Ireland, rather than having six separate select committees taking part of
Northern Ireland's affairs into their ambit.
'There has been much said here about the need to reduce the democratic
deficit in Northern Ireland.'
But Sir Patrick disagreed with an assertion by Mr James Molyneaux, the
Ulster Unionist party leader, that restoring accountable democracy to
Northern Ireland was 'a necessary first step' to restoring stability 'and
subsequently peace'.
He acknowledged that there was 'a good measure of agreement' on the need for
new political institutions in the province.
Mr Major later spoke of an 'overwhelming feeling' that the government should
strive for peace in Northern Ireland, but added: 'There are parameters to
those discussions - and that must be understood.'

FT  03 DEC 93 / High Court setback to fishing curbs plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversial plans by the government to keep the British fishing fleet tied
up in port for part of the year could be shelved after the High Court
yesterday referred the matter to the European Court in Luxembourg.
Planned legislation restricting the number of days spent by fishing vessels
at sea to 1991 levels was challenged in court by the National Federation of
Fishermen's Organisations, which represents 6,000 fishermen in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
Mr Richard Banks, the federation's chief executive, hailed the High Court
decision as a triumph. 'It's given the government a severe bloody nose,' he
said. 'We didn't want to win because that would have involved a very
expensive appeals process, so it's the best outcome for us.'
The agriculture ministry has said it may appeal against the decision. The
government has until Wednesday to decide whether to lodge an appeal.
The fishermen will go to the High Court again on January 11 to argue that
implementation of the 'tie-up rules', which were due to come into effect on
January 1, should be put off until after a European Court judgment, which
could take at least two years.
Mr Gavin Strang, Labour agriculture spokesman, said: 'The government has a
moral obligation to accept that the tie-up rules are now finished.'
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, planned to introduce the limits
as part of the government's commitment to conserve fish stocks. Under
European Union fisheries policy the UK fleet must be cut by 19 per cent by
1996.
Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, said yesterday's decision 'prolongs the
period of uncertainty in the industry and is not in the best interests of
conserving fish stocks or the fishermen who depend upon them'.
Fishermen agree that over-fishing has to be stopped, but they want
conservation measures to be targeted at species which are most depleted such
as cod. They also believe it could be done by introducing other measures -
such as increasing the mesh size of nets so that younger fish slip through -
rather than restricting fishing time.
The government has started a programme of decommissioning, paying fishermen
to leave the industry. It has earmarked Pounds 25m for compensation, of
which Pounds 8m has already been spent. Officials suggested that yesterday's
judgment could mean the remaining Pounds 17m would be withdrawn.
Mr Banks said the government could not withdraw the funding available for
decommissioning as it would be in breach of EU guidelines.
He said he was encouraged by the recognition given by the High Court judges
that the tie-up ruling could cause severe financial hardship for the fishing
industry. Lawyers acting for the fishermen said they were fairly confident
from the wording of the judgment that a stay of execution on the new rules
would be granted.

FT  03 DEC 93 / BBC complaints reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The governors of the BBC yesterday outlined a new approach to the handling
of serious complaints about corporation broadcasts as part of a reform of
the accountability of the organisation.
A new Programme Complaints Unit will investigate complaints on behalf of
viewers and listeners. There will be a right of appeal to a sub-committee of
the governors.
The new procedure is part of a wider move towards increasing the
accountability of the BBC, including a redefinition of the role and
responsibilities of the governors as trustees of the public.
This implies a less detailed intervention in the day-to-day running of the
corporation than has sometimes been the case in the past.
In future the governors will concentrate on:
Agreeing a BBC strategy and holding management to account for its
perfor-mance.
Staying closely in touch with public opinion, partly through a larger number
of advisory bodies. Ensuring the BBC complies with its legal and statutory
obligations and internal guidelines and policies.
Providing more detailed and candid reports to licence payers and parliament
on the corporation's performance.

The High Court yesterday reserved judgment on a move by Courage, the brewer,
to block a pub landlord's claim that it must renew his old lease instead of
offering him new terms. Courage says it cannot renew Mr James Little's
five-year lease because it could lead the company into breaching regulations
aimed at freeing pubs from the control of the big brewers.
Mr Little has refused to sign a new lease requiring him to pay more than
double the rent.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Move to resolve flexitime row
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials of MSF, the manufacturing, science and finance union, said last
night that they were trying to 'avoid confrontation' with Refuge Assurance
following deadlock over the company's demands to change the way it operates
flexitime working.
The changes were tied to a 1.8 per cent pay rise in June. Staff working
fixed hours got the money, as did those on flexitime who agreed individually
to the changes after MSF had refused to do so.
Those who kept to the union line have not had the pay rise.
MSF has asked to meet Mr John Cudworth, Refuge chairman, to discuss what it
says is a 'deteriorating' situation.

The Serious Fraud Office is to continue its prosecution of Mr Malcolm
Johnson, the former owner of the Duralite Manufacturing Company, in spite of
dropping charges against two other defendants accused of fraud, John Mason
writes.
All fraud charges against Mr Mungo Park of Earls Court, London, and Mr Alex
Dann of Kensington, London, were finally dropped yesterday by the SFO. The
judge, Mr Justice Colman, ordered their formal acquittal.
The two men had been accused, with Mr Johnson of conspiring to fraudulently
induce investments in Duralite by making misleading statements and other
offences.
Mr Johnson will now be prosecuted on two charges of theft relating to a
Pounds 1m rights issue by Energy Capital, a company whose subsidiaries he
had connections with.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Lilley may allow cut in retirement benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers could be allowed to provide lower pension benefits than those
guaranteed in the state earnings related pension scheme under proposals to
be set out for consultation by the government today.
A paper outlining alternatives to the state guaranteed minimum pension, the
portion of an occupational pension which must rise with inflation, is to be
published today by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary.
The paper, intended as a discussion document, asks for comment from the
pensions industry by January 14.
The paper - publication of which was widely expected as soon as the
equalisation of state pension ages was announced - asks how to minimise
burdens on business and taxpayers while safeguarding individuals' rights.
The government has suggested that while it is likely to increase the
regulation of occupational pension schemes, it would like to balance that by
reducing some of the administrative burdens it now imposes on employers.
The paper appears to favour a suggestion that benefits which employers must
provide under GMP need no longer be equal to those promised under the state
earnings related pension scheme.
Occupational schemes whose members contract out of Serps receive national
insurance contribution rebates to provide GMP, thus reducing the
government's need to provide more expensive Serps benefits in the future.
For many scheme members GMP has been the sole guarantee that at least a
portion of their pension will rise with inflation.
Instead of this complicated system, the paper suggests, the administrative
burden on employers could be reduced by adopting a 'quality test' based on
certification by an actuary that the standard contribution rate was
calculated to be enough to provide the minimum benefit.
While the paper says the option is simply one of many, it lists several
advantages and relatively few disadvantages.
To guarantee that adequate minimum benefits are paid - both to protect
scheme members and to ensure the government receives value for the
contributions it makes to private employers' schemes - the government would
have to stipulate how that calculation was made.
This option could offer significant administrative cost savings for schemes,
although to avoid damaging scheme members during a transitional period it
could force employers to provide more generous benefits than they would have
been required to under GMP.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Pensions concern as coal sale bill published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night failed to quell concern about mineworkers'
pensions when it published the bill to facilitate the privatisation of
British Coal.
After the 160-page bill was published Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman,
said that British Coal was concerned about the extent of powers reserved for
the industry secretary of state and believed the bill should fully reflect
the government's commitments on pensions.
He said further work was needed on pensions to ensure a proper balance
between the government and pension scheme beneficiaries.
The government said it would guarantee that pensions from pre-privatisation
service with British Coal would be increased in line with the retail prices
index.
Beneficiaries would get further pensions increases out of their share of any
surpluses, and pension entitlements from future service with private-sector
successors to British Coal would be protected by law in industry-wide
schemes.
Two new pension schemes would be created for employees of British Coal and
its subsidiaries who transfer to employment in successor companies.
Pensions was one of the most contentious issues surrounding the bill to
privatise British Rail in the last parliament.
The government also made clear yesterday that it would safeguard existing
entitlements to concessionary coal of past and present employees of British
Coal.
Yesterday's bill seeks to establish a coal authority to issue licences to
private-sector companies. This will own and grant access to coal reserves
but will not be able to mine coal itself.
British Coal will continue to exist as a licensee of the authority for a
transitional period after the reorganisation of the industry. It will be
dissolved 'in due course'.
The government is seeking views on proposals to establish a single regime
for the exploitation of minerals including coal.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Businesses face tax shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of new businesses will be affected by the Inland Revenue's new
system of self-assessment for taxes as soon as next year, officials said
yesterday.
Under proposals unveiled in the Budget any business started after next April
5 will be assessed for tax on the profits earned in its first year, rather
than on the prior-year basis which is used now.
Existing businesses will continue to pay tax on a prior-year basis in
1994-95, but will then start to be affected by transitional arrangements
under which tax will be based on average profits from the current and
preceding years.
Up to 9m taxpayers, about half self-employed, will start to receive new tax
returns under the self-assessment plan from April 1997.
Surveys by the Revenue suggest that up to two-thirds of the self-employed
and a smaller proportion of other taxpayers will take full advantage of the
new system.
They will be expected to return payments and tax forms by January 31 in the
year after their tax year. Final settlement will be expected by the
following July 31.
The remainder of taxpayers will be free to continue asking the Revenue to
assess their liability but must return their tax forms earlier, by September
30 after the end of their tax year.
Revenue officials said yesterday they intended to launch consultation with
professional bodies on a system to obtain rulings in disputed cases.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Forecast of 4,500 cable jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US telecommunications operator Nynex is to invest Pounds 1.1bn in
north-west England over the next five years in a project which it predicts
could create about 4,500 jobs.
The company is to start work next month on a 53-mile multimedia
'super-highway' for cable TV, telephone, data and general
telecommunications. The hybrid fibre optics and coaxial ring main will run
through parts of Merseyside, Cheshire, Greater Manchester and north-east
Lancashire.
Nynex said the new system would have the advantages of a single control
centre and economies of scale in servicing and administration in comparison
with fragmented and separate cable networks.
The company plans branch networks and spurs from the ring main, including
one to north Staffordshire, bringing the system's reach to about 1.6m homes
and at least 90,000 businesses. Nynex will employ about 2,500 people
directly and said a further 2,000 jobs would be created among contractors
and suppliers.
Nynex recently bought several north-west cable franchises from Pactel,
McClean Hunter and Telecable, giving it nine contiguous territories. The
company is talking to adjacent franchisees about mutual servicing and is
looking for more acquisitions.
Mr Eugene Connell, president and chief executive, said in Manchester
yesterday that Nynex aimed to undercut British Telecommunications by 15 per
cent and offer a wider range and better quality of services to business
subscribers.
The system will have interactive capabilities. Business users and the
emergency services will able to set up direct links between each other for
voice, data and video communications. It should also be able to link into
global multi-media information highways and offer technology for local TV
production and programming.
Funding is being split between Nynex Corporation in the US, debt finance
from financial institutions and cashflow from Nynex's UK operations as
people and businesses subscribe. About Pounds 460m of debt finance will be
raised next year, including Pounds 130m for the ring main itself. The first
customers will come on stream next month.
Mr Connell said ultimate profitability relied on achieving 50 per cent
household penetration for cable TV, and 20 per cent of the telephone market
targets.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Companies braced for tough balance sheet rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies will have to meet tough new requirements when showing capital
instruments in balance sheets from June 22 next year, under the final
version of a new accounting standard issued today.
Financial Reporting Standard 4, produced by the Accounting Standards Board,
requires many capital instruments currently classified as equity to be shown
as non-equity or liabilities.
The ruling will affect exotic instruments designed to circumvent existing
rules such as convertible capital bonds. They will increase substantially
the apparent borrowings of British companies and boost disclosure in their
accounts. The main elements are:
Capital instruments must be classified as liabilities if they contain an
obligation to transfer cash or other resources.
Share capital should be analysed as equity and non-equity. Any which shares
which are restricted or have a restricted right to dividends should be shown
as non-equity to the value of the full consideration received.
Convertible debt should be separately disclosed and included as a liability
until it is converted into shareholders' funds.
Minority interests in subsidiaries should be analysed between equity and
non-equity interests.
The board has maintained its position that liabilities such as commercial
paper must continue to be classified according to the legal terms of its
maturity - generally short-term - unless the same lender is firmly committed
to refinance the debt on the same terms.

A proposal to drop two of the six stations planned for the Pounds 100m
extension of the Docklands Light Railway to Lewisham in south London has
been attacked by the local MP, Charles Batchelor writes.
The Lewisham extension, given approval in the Budget, will be less
attractive to tourists if the Cutty Sark and Island Gardens stations are not
included, Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich, said.
Docklands Light Railway regards the Lewisham extension as essential for the
long-term growth of revenues. The two stops would add tourist use at
weekends and in the summer.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Nuclear Electric calls for sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity company, yesterday risked
antagonising ministers when it coupled its publication of strongly improved
interim results with a call for privatisation.
A statement by Mr John Collier, its chairman, that the company's future lay
in the private sector came only a week after Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister,
rebuked the company for earlier calls for privatisation by saying that it
was up to the government to decide if and when the industry was sold off.
Nuclear Electric announced pre-tax profits for the six months to September
30 of Pounds 463m, against Pounds 221m for the same period last year.
Operating profits were Pounds 497m, up from Pounds 255m.
If the effects of the nuclear levy are excluded, however, the company shows
an operating loss of Pounds 118m, compared with a Pounds 377m loss in the
corresponding period last year.
The company says the levy enables it to discharge liabilities inherited from
the Central Electricity Generating Board when the rest of the electricity
industry was privatised.
The improvement was helped by high productivity and a considerably better
performance from the company's five advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs),
which have previously performed below expectations and design capacity.
Income from electricity sales was Pounds 861m, up from Pounds 618m,
reflecting an increase in power market share in England and Wales from 21.6
per cent to 25 per cent. Nuclear Levy receipts fell 3 per cent to Pounds
615m.
The company said it was studying an offer for reprocessing contracts with
British Nuclear Fuels. The deals are being negotiated after the government's
decision last year not to underwrite them.
Nuclear Electric provided Pounds 316m, included in operating costs, for
decommissioning and disposal of used fuel in connection with the half year
operations. It paid Pounds 306m in discharging CEGB liabilities.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Treasury to pay Pounds 380,000 over canteen irregularities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has agreed to pay the Inland Revenue Pounds 380,000 after its
catering arm made irregular payments to staff over 10 years.
The sum will cover tax and national insurance contributions which should
have been deducted from the pay of casual staff employed by Forward Civil
Service Catering, a Treasury agency. The National Audit Office last year
revealed financial irregularities in the agency, including mismanagement and
fraud.
Sir John Bourn, head of the audit office, says in his report on the
Treasury's 1992-93 accounts that the total loss to public funds could be
Pounds 900,000.
Sir John welcomes efforts to tighten up on financial management and improve
controls over cash, stock and credit sales, but remains critical of Treasury
failure to deal with continuing weaknesses, which include:
Delegation of audit checks to junior staff with insufficient follow-up to
remedy deficiencies.
Poor record keeping at headquarters, particularly on departmental budgets
and management fees.
Weak controls over cash in tills and vending machines, with receipts not
fully banked and paperwork missing.
Poor stock control procedures, including lack of security and unreliable
records.
While Forward's performance was within 1 per cent of its target gross profit
margin, the audit office found 'considerable variations' from budget in
individual items.
Sir John says: 'Such variations can be a valuable indicator of matters
perhaps going wrong. There were still some cases where variations did not
appear to have been thoroughly examined.'

FT  03 DEC 93 / Scots school vote is blow to opting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's policy of encouraging schools in Scotland to opt out of
local authority control suffered a severe blow yesterday when parents at
Paisley Grammar, a leading comprehensive school near Glasgow, rejected
opting out by a big majority.
Earlier this year Dornoch Academy in Sutherland became the first school in
Scotland to have its application for self-governing status accepted by the
Scottish Office.
Paisley Grammar was considered a likely candidate for opting out. There had
been suggestions that the regional council was starving it of resources, and
it is regarded as a 'magnet' school in its area because of its academic
record.
In 1988 Mrs Margaret Thatcher intervened with the Scottish Office to prevent
Strathclyde regional council from closing Paisley Grammar on the grounds
that it was making another nearby school unviable. She acted at the
prompting of Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, an old boy of the
school.
Legislation to allow schools in Scotland to opt out was subsequently
introduced after earlier legislation had created school boards or governors
A petition requesting a ballot on Paisley Grammar opting out was signed by
219 parents. The turnout was 76 per cent of the 1,630 people who received
ballot papers. Eighty per cent of parents taking part in the ballot voted
against opting out.
Mr Tom Farrell, chairman of Strathclyde education committee, called the
result 'a massive vote of confidence in the educational provision of the
authority'.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish education minister, said he was
confident the parents would come to recognise the benefits of self-governing
status in the future.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Mortgage rise points to fragile homes recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs that a fragile recovery in the housing market is continuing came
yesterday with figures from the Bank of England showing a small increase in
the number of mortgage approvals.
The number of new loans approved was slightly higher in October than in
September, prompting the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents
building societies and banks, to welcome the figures as evidence that the
recovery was gathering pace.
Net lending during October in both seasonally adjusted and non-adjusted
terms was slightly lower than in September, when it amounted to just over
Pounds 2bn.
In spite of the fairly flat numbers lenders have been encouraged by the
Budget decision not to abolish mortgage tax relief altogether.
The lending figures came as two surveys from the UK's largest building
societies show prices rising slightly compared with last year. But the
surveys do not present a clear picture of price movements compared with last
month.
The survey for the Nationwide, the UK's second largest society, shows house
prices were 2.3 per cent higher than a year ago. The Halifax survey says
that prices were 1.5 per cent higher than a year ago, and on course for an
overall increase of 2 per cent this year.
But while the survey for the Halifax shows house prices rising slightly in
November, the Nationwide survey shows a fall of 1.5 per cent from October
prices.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, said that there was
little evidence yet of a strong recovery, and added that he thought the
increase in mortgage approvals reflected people switching from building
society mortgages to fixed rate mortgages.
He said however, that not having a Budget in March would assist the recovery
as it would end uncertainties in the spring, which was a good period for the
housing market.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said
that now pre-Budget uncertainty had ended there was every reason to expect
that the stronger levels of mortgage approvals to feed through into
advances.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Projects in the UK to benefit from a Pounds 15.5m European Union aid package
for regions suffering from cuts in defence spending were named yesterday.
The grants, which will be matched by equal amounts from local authorities or
the private sector, will go to 150 projects selected from 250 applications
from private companies, local authorities and enterprise agencies.
The grants can be used for economic regeneration, training, new product
development and environmental schemes.
For the first time areas in the south-east and south-west of England will
benefit from EU structural funds.
Successful applicants include a new small business centre in Fife and a plan
to revive the Woolwich Arsenal in London. Grants range from Pounds 2,500 for
an information development project in Leeds to more than Pounds 1.3m for a
plan to diversify the local economy of a defence-dependent area of the
south-west. Every region of England, with Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales
and Gibraltar, will benefit.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Watchdog increases pressure on BT profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulatory pressure on British Telecommunications to cut its prices and
profits appears likely to increase sharply if interest rates remain low,
following a policy statement yesterday by Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator.
The prospect was raised by Oftel's settlement of a long-running dispute
between BT and Mercury, its main UK competitor, over charges paid by Mercury
for the use of BT's network to deliver calls to their destinations.
By reducing interconnection prices paid by Mercury, Oftel's determination
will further boost competition in the UK telecommunications market. The
settlement is worth at least Pounds 60m to Mercury this year in lower prices
and back payments.
In reaching its decision Oftel sharply cut the rate of return on capital it
allows BT. When setting BT's current price cap in June 1992 Oftel allowed BT
a return on capital of between 16.5 per cent and 18.5 per cent. In
yesterday's Mercury determination it cut the figure to 15 per cent, citing
lower interest rates.
BT's price formula, setting average price rises at 7.5 percentage points
below the rate of inflation each year, is to be reviewed in 1996.
Robert Fleming, the brokers, estimated that applying the reduced rate of
return to BT's existing price cap would have cut this year's pre-tax profits
by about Pounds 300m, around 10 per cent.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, Fleming's telecoms analyst, said: 'BT faces a very
tough negotiation with the regulator over its next price cap.'
BT said the new rate of return was 'lower than we think reasonable', but
said it did not necessarily follow that the same figure would be used for
the next price cap, even if inflation stayed low.
Mr Mike Harris, Mercury chief executive, described the Oftel determination
as a 'curate's egg'. He welcomed the reduced charges but not the obligation
imposed by Oftel to pay BT a special contribution to help cover the cost of
maintaining line rental and connection charges at an artificially low level.
Oftel ruled that Mercury would have to pay the 'access deficit
contributions' when it gained more than 10 per cent of the market for either
international or domestic calls, with a sharp rise in the level of payments
when it reached 25 per cent of either market.
By March Mercury had 19 per cent of the market for international calls and 7
per cent for domestic calls, so it will have to pay BT contributions for its
international traffic.
Inter-connecting payments to BT are Mercury's largest outgoing. With
operating profits of Pounds 192m last year, the ruling will significantly
improve its financial performance this year.
The company intends to use Pounds 9m of the proceeds to fund experiments in
using radio technology to bypass BT by providing local networks for fixed
phones.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Pounds 1.7bn of tax written off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of tax written off by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise
has mounted steeply during the recession, according to the National Audit
Office.
The Inland Revenue wrote off Pounds 1.7bn last year, almost double the
amount written off in 1991. More than three-quarters of the total is
accounted for by insolvency.
Customs &amp; Excise wrote off Pounds 825m of value added tax and customs duties
as either remitted or irrecoverable last year, up from Pounds 553m in 1991.
Most of this is also because traders became insolvent.
The Inland Revenue figures show that more than 60 per cent of large
employers fail to hand over employees' tax deducted under PAYE within the
14-day time limit after the end of the month.
The Revenue has been much more successful at collecting information on the
taxable fringe benefits received by more than 3.4m employees. According to
the audit office tax offices have achieved a 50 per cent increase in the
number of P11D forms they receive from employers giving details of
employees' benefits in kind.
There remains evidence of a high error rate in the assessment and coding of
benefits, however.
The audit office says that efforts to catch moonlighters with second
undeclared incomes and 'ghosts', people unknown to the tax authorities,
yielded Pounds 86m in tax in 1992-93. This is about 5.4 times the cost of
the collection work.

FT  03 DEC 93 / 1.5p a mile M-way tolls could raise Pounds 700m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tolls on Britain's motorways could raise a total of Pounds 700m a year if
applied across the 2,000-mile network, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, said yesterday.
Present government thinking is that cars would be charged a maximum of 1.5p
a mile and lorries 4.5p a mile so that a car journey from London to
Birmingham would cost Pounds 1.50.
This is a lower rate than charged on continental European motorways, and is
intended to prevent drivers diverting to side roads.
Ministers intend to push ahead with detailed studies of an electronic
tolling system which could be introduced by 1998, he said. Vehicles would
carry a smart card on their windscreen which would be read automatically
from overhead gantries.
It also became apparent yesterday that bus companies face pressure to raise
fares. When Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, put 3p a litre on petrol in
his Budget he also announced that the bus fuel duty rebate, which usually
compensates for such increases, would not be raised. London Buses estimates
this will add Pounds 3m a year to its costs.
However National Express, Britain's largest operator of scheduled coach
services, said it planned to absorb the higher costs without increasing
fares.
Yesterday in a Commons written answer, Mr MacGregor promised that motorway
toll charges would be devoted solely to the construction and operation of
the motorway network. The Treasury had no objection to reserving such funds
for a particular purpose because they were not taxes, he said. He also
assured MPs that the government would take the level of charges into account
when setting motoring taxes.
Electronic tolling is being introduced in many other countries but systems
are not yet sophisticated enough for Britain's heavily used motorway
network. The transport department is to invite manufacturers to submit
details of their technologies in fields such as smart cards. It will then
set up a trial system within the next year.
Organisations representing road users gave a lukewarm response to the
government announcement. The AA and the RAC, motoring organisations, said
they accepted the proposal reluctantly and only if the Treasury did not cut
the roads budget to compensate for tolls.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said it was like adding a 2 per
cent to 3 per cent value added tax by the back door. 'This is a deplorable
move which will drive yet more people off public transport,' he said.
National Express said it did not think motorway tolls would have a
significant effect on its costs but that they might persuade more motorists
to switch to coach travel. It called for a special toll rate for public
transport vehicles.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Local Government Commission in 'untenable position'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission, which is reviewing council structures in
England, is in 'an untenable position', the European Policy Forum says in a
report today.
Mr Steve Leach, lecturer at Birmingham University's Institute of Local
Government Studies and author of the report, predicted that local
authorities would have 'strong grounds for challenging its recommendations
in the courts because of inconsistency in its approach'.
He said the impetus for reform had disappeared in a 'classic example of
policy drift' (the survival of a policy initiative beyond the time when
there is any real political commitment to it), and claimed that the exercise
had already diverted large amounts of the organisational resources and
energies of local government into an exercise of 'questionable value'.
But Mr David Curry, the local government minister, denied that the review
would place extra strains on councils already trying to accommodate radical
changes in their budgets following yesterday's review of grants.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Tory flagship council is biggest grant loser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, yesterday made a point of
announcing that Wandsworth - the Conservatives' 'flagship' south London
borough - was the English local authority which had done worst out of the
redistribution of local government grants.
This, said Mr Curry, showed that the reallocation of grants had been
'colourblind'. The process, criticised on grounds of fairness over the past
year, had been carried out without regard to a council's political control.
But the redistribution has been so drastic that the government has
introduced a Pounds 280m 'buffering' scheme to ensure that no council's
grant will fall by more than 2 per cent this year. However, 82 authorities
will suffer a reduction of at least this amount.
The grant each council receives towards its spending from central government
 -additional money is made up from council taxpayers or from the council's
reserves - are determined by a complicated formula known as the Standard
Spending Assessment (SSA).
SSAs are worked out on a per capita basis and multiplied by the total
population in each authority to arrive at a figure for the overall grant it
will receive. Figures from the 1991 census were incorporated for the first
time this year, so the biggest 'losers' have been inner London authorities.
Wandsworth suffered the greatest cut in SSA (10.6 per cent), followed by
Hammersmith and Fulham (9.8 per cent), Havering (8.6 per cent), Brent (8.5
per cent) and Lambeth (7.5 per cent).
The government also made changes to the factors determining grants within
the formula.
The weight given to the proportion of ethnic minorities in an area has been
reduced, in recognition of the fact that many immigrants are
well-established and do not put as many extra burdens on the education
service as they once did.
Instead, measures which capture levels of economic deprivation have been
introduced. For the first time measures of homelessness and unemployment
will be included. The latter addresses widespread complaints from northern
cities with minimal ethnic populations but high levels of unemployment,
particularly in former mining communities, that the old formula unfairly
withheld grant from them.
There is also a measure of the number of people who suffer from long-term
illness, in recognition of the demands the growing elderly population place
on social services.
The government has introduced a measure of the number of day visitors to an
area, to capture the problems created by areas with low populations but
large numbers of commuters.
Most controversially, the 'area cost adjustment', aimed at compensating the
south-east for its high labour costs, has been increased. Northern
authorities have repeatedly branded this measure a political fix to allow
more aid to go to marginal seats in the south-east.

FT  03 DEC 93 / DTI halts appeal on Polly Peck directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has decided not to appeal against the
decision by a High Court judge to reject continued attempts to disqualify
four directors of Polly Peck International.
The DTI had to decide this week whether to fight a ruling by Mr Justice
Lindsay made at the start of November. He had decided not to extend the
deadline for proceeding with the cases.
The DTI had argued for the disqualification of Mr David Fawcus, former
finance director, Mr Mark Ellis, joint managing director, and Mr Lawrence
Tindale and Mr Ulf Siebel, non-executive directors.
It argued that they had failed adequately to monitor, probe or institute
changes to prevent funds movements to Polly Peck's near-east subsidiaries -
or to resign in the absence of changes.
But Mr Justice Lindsay called the DTI's case 'at best speculative and very
weak' and said the directors had instituted changes.
The DTI did not pursue disqualification of Mr Asil Nadir, the former
chairman of Polly Peck, who fled bail conditions to northern Cyprus in May
facing charges totalling Pounds 34m for theft and false accounting.
Mr Nadir is bankrupt and his trustee has applied for a suspension on any
automatic discharge on his bankruptcy order.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Transport role for utilities forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The water and electricity companies are expected to emerge as prime movers
in the government's drive to involve private finance in public services,
according to Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary.
Mr Dorrell told journalists yesterday that the government was trying to
create a business sector which would build road and rail infrastructure on
behalf of the transport department.
Construction companies and the banks normally act as promoters for large
projects such as the Channel tunnel and estuarial crossings.
Mr Dorrell said the benefits of involving the private sector would emerge
only if the design, financing and construction of infrastructure were under
the control of companies with expertise in managing roads and railways.
He said: 'Utility companies recognise this as a business they might move
into. There will also be foreign companies with experience of running toll
roads abroad. Not all the expertise has to be home-grown.'
Mr Dorrell said he would not be keen to see state-owned foreign operators
such as SNCF, the nationalised company which runs the French railways,
entering the market.
The Budget this week included commitments to proceed with three large
public-sector projects using private finance: the modernisation of the west
coast railway line from London to Glasgow, the extension of the Docklands
Light Railway in east London to Lewisham, and the new air traffic control
centre for Scotland.
Mr Dorrell said he expected all three projects to be out to competitive
tender by the next Budget. He acknowledged that there was 'scope for
disappointment' over the pace of progress on the private finance initiative.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Tighter curbs on tobacco ads expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected to announce tighter voluntary controls on tobacco
advertising soon to head off a private member's bill which would impose an
advertising ban.
The bill, to be tabled by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley,
would ban all cigarette, cigar and pipe tobacco advertising except at the
point of sale.
The Department of Health confirmed yesterday that tighter voluntary controls
being considered for tobacco advertising include:
A ban on poster advertising.
An end to tobacco advertising in women's magazines.
Removal of tobacconists' shop front advertising.
Larger health warnings on cigarette packs.
The Advertising Association, the umbrella group for advertisers as well as
practitioners, accused the government of over-reacting. Ms Fionnuala
Tennyson, associate director, said said it was 'totally inappropriate to go
any further without any real evidence' that advertising had an effect on
tobacco consumption.
The Tobacco Advisory Council, the trade body for UK tobacco manufacturers,
said advertising stimulated competition between brands, rather than
encouraging anyone to smoke. The total tobacco retail market is worth about
Pounds 10bn a year and about Pounds 60m is spent by the industry on
advertising.
Mr Barron, who won third place in a backbench Commons ballot for the right
to introduce legislation, yesterday claimed the support of more than 200 MPs
of all parties.
The government, however, is firmly opposed to legislative controls on
tobacco advertising, which ministers believe are less effective than
voluntary curbs. This approach was confirmed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, in his Budget speech on Tuesday.
Government MPs are not normally given voting instructions on private
members' legislation but the government would have little difficulty in
finding procedural ways of killing the bill if it wished.
Ash, the anti-smoking lobby group, said yesterday it was concerned that the
government would not be able to get the industry to agree to tighter curbs,
particularly now that it had, in effect, taken away the threat of
legislation.
Britain has blocked an attempt by the European Commission to ban advertising
by directive, and ministers rejected similar proposals by the Commons health
committee earlier this year.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Sunday shopping opponents muster forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opponents of deregulated Sunday shopping yesterday launched a last-minute
campaign to swing wavering Labour MPs into line before a vital Commons vote
next week.
Keep Sunday Special (KSS), a coalition of church, trade union and small
retailing groups, claims the support of a majority of MPs for tight controls
on Sunday shopping in England and Wales.
Organisers are privately worried that the Labour front bench and the
executive of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, are boosting support for
deregulation.
MPs will choose in a free vote on Wednesday between three options in the
Sunday trading bill intended to replace the 1950 Shops Act:
Full deregulation, supported by the prime minister, the chancellor and Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, who is responsible for the bill.
Unrestricted trading hours for small shops, with a six-hour limit on larger
stores, which is supported by the Shopping Hours Reform Council (SHRC),
mainly representing chain stores.
Limited opening for small shops, DIY stores and garden centres, with
unrestricted opening for all shops on four Sundays before Christmasm, which
is the option supported by KSS.
The group's hopes were damaged during the second reading debate when Mr Tony
Blair, the shadow home secretary, described its proposals as unworkable.
Its main concern, however, is the Usdaw executive council's decision in
October to switch support from the KSS proposal to the SHRC option.
The decision has prompted concern among Usdaw-sponsored MPs loyal to KSS,
who fear other Labour MPs may follow the executive's lead.
In an attempt to shore up Labour support KSS has stepped up its attack on
the bill's employment protection provisions, which it says are 'not worth
the paper they are written on'. The group released a survey of Usdaw members
showing that 55 per cent of those contacted had not worked on Sundays, and
95 per cent of those did not wish to.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Insurers to pass on 3% tax cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most consumers seem likely to face increased costs for home and motor
insurance next year as the country's largest companies digest the
implications of the introduction earlier this week of a 3 per cent premium
tax.
Prudential and Pearl, two companies predominantly concerned with life
insurance, have been quick to promise customers that they would absorb the
costs by means of improvements in efficiency.
But the composite insurers, which have a larger share of the 'personal
lines' insurance market, say costs must be passed on to their customers.
'Somehow the cost will have to be passed on to the policyholder. I can't see
how we can afford to absorb it,' said Mr Mike Jones, head of public
relations for Sun Alliance, the largest insurer of homes in the UK. 'At the
moment, the market is not keen to reduce rates when we are still rebuilding.
We are not in the business of making rash promises,' he added.
Mr Roy Randall, head of corporate relations at Royal Insurance, the second
largest home insurer, said his company would also pass on the tax to buyers.
Royal fears that the 3 per cent rate may be increased in future years,
aligning it with the premium tax rates which are common elsewhere in Europe.
Legal &amp; General, a company mainly concerned with life insurance which has a
sizeable slice of the home insurance market, also insists that the costs
must be passed on.
'Those companies who claim to be able to absorb the additional cost have not
fully thought through the implications, particularly to shareholders,' the
group warned.
'This is the thin end of the wedge. When it comes to taxes, chancellors are
like starving men - they can never get enough,' added Mr David Prosser,
group chief executive.

FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US-EU Airbus deal likely to be extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIANS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a year of fruitless negotiations, trade officials in Geneva appear to
have found a formula which will extend the bilateral US-EU deal on state
support for the European Airbus to all Gatt members.
The formula marks an important breakthrough in an area which had threatened
to become a serious obstacle in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
The aim is to revise Gatt's existing code of fair practice on trade in civil
aircraft by December 15, in parallel with the Uruguay Round negotiations.
The new approach, proposed by the Swedish chairman of the sub-committee
discussing extension of the Airbus agreement, is based on the draft round
accord on subsidies, modified and supplemented to take account of the
special requirements of the aircraft industry.
Trade officials said yesterday the approach had won the support of all the
main participants in the negotiations, including the US and EU, though much
of the detail - including acceptable levels of state support - remained to
be agreed.
A revised text is now being prepared for discussion early next week by the
code's 22 members (the EU counting as one).
It proved more difficult than expected to 'multilateralise' the bilateral
pact, which applies only to large aircraft and to US and EU support systems.
The accord, signed last year after eight years of trans-atlantic feuding,
prohibits subsidies for aircraft production and caps development support at
33 per cent of spending.
It also places curbs on indirect supports, such as those derived by US
manufacturers from government defence and aerospace contracts.
If finished on time, the revised aircraft code would be incorporated into
the Uruguay Round package applicable to all Gatt's 112 members.
Three important competitors - Taiwan, China and Russia - are not currently
Gatt members but may be obliged to sign up to the code as a condition of
joining the world trade body.

<TEXT>
The last remaining hurdle to implementation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement on January 1 has been removed with an agreement between the US,
Canada and Mexico to negotiate an anti-dumping and subsidy code over the
next two years.
Canada's prime minister, Mr Jean Chretien, who pressed for the code to
fulfil a pledge in the recent election campaign to renegotiate parts of
Nafta, yesterday presented the deal as a significant improvement to the
agreement hammered out by the previous Conservative government.
The three governments have agreed to set up one working group on subsidies
and countervailing duties, and another on anti-dumping rules. Trade minister
Mr Roy MacLaren said yesterday the Canadians had been assured that the
Clinton administration 'will enter into these discussions in good faith'.
There is no guarantee however, that a code will be drawn up by the target
date of December 31 1995.
The new Liberal government in Ottawa failed to persuade Washington to reopen
Nafta's energy provisions. Despite reservations expressed by Alberta oil and
gas producers, the Liberals had pushed for special assurances that Canada
would be able to hold back energy exports to the US in the event of
shortages.
In a declaration of its own, Canada said it would take any measures
necessary to ensure domestic energy security, including the establishment of
energy reserves or new incentives for oil and gas exploration.
The Canadian parliament passed Nafta enabling legislation earlier this year,
but the law has yet to be promulgated.
The US sees few, if any, obstacles to Chile's accession to Nafta or a
bilateral free trade accord with Washington, Mr Curtis Kamman, the US
ambassador in Santiago, said yesterday, writes David Pilling in Santiago
There were no specific environmental or labour issues blocking an agreement,
he said. The US would, however, 'watch with interest' the passage of Chile's
environmental protection bill and would hope to see swift implementation of
its new regulatory framework.

The European Commission is preparing to examine details of a new
co-operation deal between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, the
state-owned telecommunications groups.
Commission officials confirmed yesterday that the two companies had already
made contact informally, but refused to comment on Brussels' likely attitude
to a deeper alliance.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom revealed late on Wednesday that they
were planning a press conference about their plans on Tuesday in Brussels.
Industry observers believe they may be preparing to merge certain areas of
their activity, outside domestic 'voice' services.
On the same day, telecoms ministers from the European Union will be holding
further discussions about the Commission's proposals on liberalisation of
the telecoms sector.
If the case does fall under the Commission's jurisdiction - either as a
merger, or because of other monopoly considerations - the attitude of the
Commission's competition directorate will be crucial.
The deal could well become one of the most sensitive anti-trust cases yet
examined by the Brussels authorities.
Competition officials said yesterday they would work closely on the case
with other Commission departments, notably telecoms and industry.
In his contribution to the Commission's proposed white paper on growth,
competitiveness and employment - to be discussed by EU leaders on December
10 and 11 - Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry and telecoms commissioner, has
stressed the need to adapt to the existence of an 'information society',
using telecoms networks and served by strong telecoms and information
technology groups. The Commission is to push through controversial measures
to extend liberalisation of the telecoms terminal and telecoms services
markets to the satellite communications sector.
Brussels yesterday approved amendments which will abolish national
restrictions on the provision of satellite earth station equipment,
satellite services used by business networks, and mobile tracking services.
The Commission can impose these amendments because the original directives
were adopted using powers to break open national monopolies. The Commission
said it hoped the measures would be in force by the end of next year.

Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications operator, said yesterday it
planned to enter into 'intensive co-operation' with Unisource, the joint
venture linking the telecom companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and
Switzerland.
The move is widely regarded as a first step towards Telefonica's taking an
equity stake in Unisource, which is aimed at providing one-stop
telecommunications services to the world's multinationals.
PTT Telecom, the Dutch shareholder in Unisource, said: 'We don't rule out
the possibility that Telefonica will become a shareholder at a later stage.'
Unisource is fighting to establish itself in the field of 'outsourcing' in
direct competition with ventures by AT&amp;T, British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom.
Telefonica will not be able to enter into deals with Unisource's
competitors.

FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US pressure over cars irks Tokyo -
Campaign for market access runs into mounting criticism
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Criticism of the US approach to opening up Japan's market to foreign cars
and car parts is mounting in Tokyo, as the two countries still remain wide
apart on key issues in their bilateral trade and economic framework talks.
In a rare move, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association published a
statement that is highly critical of the course being taken in the US-Japan
framework talks, in which the two countries aim to increase foreign access
to Japan's markets.
The statement points out that, while attempts to correct the trade imbalance
should be based on a broad discussion of macro-economic policy, the focus of
the bilateral talks has been on micro-economic issues such as cars and car
parts.
The association also criticises the US proposals to increase market access
for foreign companies in Japan as going beyond the bounds of the two
governments' activities.
Irresponsible intervention by governments in private business not only leads
to managed trade, but in effect reduces consumers' choice, it says.
The industry association is particularly concerned that the US proposal to
set 'specific expectations' for foreign penetration of the Japanese car and
vehicle parts markets is in effect a call for numerical targets.
Neither do the US proposals reflect any efforts on the part of the US, even
though the framework consultations call for efforts to be taken by both
sides, it says.
That point was underlined by a high-ranking Japanese government official,
who indicated that US carmakers were not making the kind of efforts
necessary to win over Japanese consumers.
Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs, said that
Chrysler's decision not to bring its new car, the Neon, to the Tokyo Motor
Show this autumn was disappointing.
The Neon, which is widely considered to be a 'Japan car killer', was just
right in terms of price and engine size for the Japanese market, Mr Okamatsu
said.
If US car companies were not going to bring that kind of car to the Japanese
market they should not ask for help to penetrate the market, Mr Okamatsu
said.
He further underlined that there was 'no chance' that Japan would agree to
set numerical targets for foreign sales in Japan.
Not only did numerical targets carry the risk of leading to managed trade,
they were not necessary for foreign companies to succeed in Japan.
According to data published yesterday, the foreign share of the Japanese
public pro-curement computer market, which was 7.6 per cent in fiscal 1991,
rose to 14.4 per cent in 1992 after an action plan was implemented to make
public procurement more fair and open, Mr Okamatsu noted.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Failure to reach a Gatt agreement 'would dash economic confidence and reopen
disputes supposedly settled as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations', a
senior US official told a trade conference in Paris yesterday.
Mrs Joan Spero, US under-secretary of state for economic and agricultural
affairs, warned that in particular the arrangement which the US and the
European Union reached in June on oilseeds might come unstuck if the Gatt
round failed.
She also said Europe's common agricultural policy 'could be challenged in
the Gatt or by private parties under domestic trade laws'.
On culture, the other main sticking point between the US and France, Mrs
Spero said protectionism by Europe could backfire against 'European
producers, directors, writers, actors, cinematographers who are a major
force in American films'. Such European artists might lose these
opportunities in the US, she said.
Nevertheless, the US official said, 'the noises coming from the Brussels
negotiations are good.' She said the US believed its Blair House agreement
with the EU 'is the basis upon which the Uruguay Round can be concluded',
apparently indicating that Washington is not adhering to every last detail
of an accord which France has hotly contested.
Mr Francois Perigot, president of the French employers' federation, told the
conference that 'nothing would be worse than the failure of seven years of
negotiation' in the Uruguay Round.

THE US sees few, if any, obstacles to Chile's accession to Nafta or a
bilateral free trade accord with Washington, Mr Curtis Kamman, the US
ambassador in Santiago, said yesterday.
Unlike most Latin American countries, which needed to liberalise their
economies and lower tariffs, 'Chile has done all that. There's not much left
for it to do,' he said.
There were no specific environmental or labour issues blocking an agreement,
he said. The US would, however, 'watch with interest' the passage of Chile's
environmental protection bill and would hope to see swift implementation of
its new regulatory framework.
Further talks would be necessary in the area of intellectual property
rights, where Chile had made some, though insufficient, progress. In
particular, US pharmaceutical companies wanted greater protection for their
patented products. The US was 'serious' about concluding new trade
agreements 'in the near future'. However, 'we have not yet decided whether
our preferred course is additional bilateral agreements with other countries
or their accession to Nafta.'
He rejected arguments that the US administration would tread carefully
because of 'blood on the carpet' after the Nafta debate or because it now
wished to concentrate on healthcare reform.
The US was quite capable of pursuing parallel domestic and foreign policies,
he said. Besides, President Clinton 'made clear during the Nafta debate that
he wants to extend the agreement to other countries, with Chile mentioned as
the first in line.'
Canada's new Liberal government announced yesterday that it would enforce
Nafta after obtaining improved rules on subsidies and dumping, Reuter
reports from Ottawa.

talks

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade officials in Geneva yesterday were philosophical about the lack of
concrete results in the Gatt negotiations and said they were encouraged by
reports of progress. 'They do seem to be coming to some specific results,'
said one. 'If we get something on Monday, that would just about fit in with
the negotiating timetable, though there will be a lot of work to do next
week.'
Officials at Gatt headquarters said Mr Peter Sutherland, the
director-general, was in close touch with the US and EU negotiators, but he
declined to comment.
The relatively upbeat mood among officials appears to reflect a belief that
the setting of fresh US-EU talks for Monday partly reflected Sir Leon
Brittan's wish to avoid presenting a draft accord to EU ministers at last
night's special council meeting, as demanded by France. This in effect
prevents Paris putting a spoke in the wheel of the Uruguay Round
negotiations before they conclude on December 15.
Nonetheless, there will be disappointment among trading partners that US-EU
differences over market access for goods and services could not be resolved
before today's key meeting in Geneva to evaluate the results in the round so
far.
Although it is already clear that the Uruguay Round target of one-third
tariff cuts is likely to be exceeded, overall gains from the round still
remain heavily dependent on what the two trading giants decide to give each
other, for instance, on textiles, fish, non-ferrous metals and electronics.
In addition, the two sides have not yet resolved differences over financial
services, maritime transport and audio-visual services.
Trade officials said that intensive negotiations on all aspects of the round
would continue through the weekend on the assumption that a US-EU deal was
close. 'The rest of the process is in reasonably good shape for the final
bargaining,' said a senior trade diplomat.

FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Cruise ship lifeline for Cuban economy -
Castro's latest attempt to attract dollars from tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROSIE HAYES and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the cruise ship Santiago de Cuba sails later this month from Havana, it
will underline the extent to which revolutionary fervour is giving way to
pragmatism as Cuba tries to adjust to economic hardship.
On board ship, there will be gambling - although it will not be allowed in
Cuban ports. The government of President Fidel Castro is now accepting an
activity it banned when it closed Havana's notorious gambling parlours after
the 1959 revolution.
Compared with the previous policy shifts forced on the Cuban government by
the collapse of the Soviet Union and its financial support for Cuba, this is
small. Among other things, the government has been aggressively pursuing
previously unwelcome foreign investors and has legalised use of the
once-banned US dollar.
The cruise operation - a joint venture between the state-owned Havanatur and
European interests, including the Italian ship agents Fratelli Cosulich - is
the latest attempt to attract tourist dollars to the country.
Mr Castro is now laying much emphasis on the promotion of tourism. He turned
up last month on the holiday island of Cayo Coco at a ceremonial signing of
a Spanish-Cuban joint venture and mingled with tourists, even at one stage
watching a dance performance in a discotheque. The joint venture involves
the Spanish group Guitart Hotels investing Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) over
10 years and the local Cubanacana SA contributing the equivalent in local
currency.
He spoke of fighting the country's financial problems through tourism and
told Cubans to prepare for an influx of foreign visitors.
The president has also heaped praise on Spain, probably the most important
source of foreign investment in the Cuban tourist industry, and has
described Spanish skill and enterprise as a great advantage to the island.
He even told an audience of Havana Communist party delegates this month that
sugar was 'no longer the country's main economic source' and that the
tourist industry had developed to such an extent it was now 'Cuba's main
financial lifeline'.
The number of visitors to Cuba has increased from 289,000 in 1987 to 460,000
last year, and is forecast to grow again this year. Visitors are also
spending more. According to the government, daily spending rose to Dollars
67 a day in 1990 to Dollars 89 in 1992, and is predicted to increase to
Dollars 100 in 1995.
But there are doubts among external observers whether tourism is as
important as the government suggests. Mr Jorge Dominguez, a Harvard
professor and visiting fellow at the Washington-based study group
InterAmerican Dialogue, says that total foreign direct investment in Cuba is
an elusive figure, but probably amounts to less than Dollars 1bn. 'That
means the claim that tourism is significant rests on its generation of
foreign exchange.'
Yet the foreign exchange earnings usually quoted by Cuban sources represent
gross, rather than net earnings. A report produced in March by the Cuban
Grupo de Turismo said that tourism generated Dollars 530m in gross
hard-currency receipts in 1992 - four times the 1987 level - and directly
accounted for 62,000 jobs, 1.6 per cent of total employment.
A report published in April by La Sociedad Economica, a moderate
London-based exile group which favours the country's transformation to a
market economy, also points out that the policy of keeping tourists in
enclaves 'limits the market for locally-produced goods and services, so
reducing the beneficial effect that tourism could generate in the wider
economy'.
The net hard-currency benefit is thus significantly less than the gross
receipts. Tourists have to be serviced by imports, such as Scotch whisky and
video cassettes. Sales commissions, tour operating profits, and aviation
expenses must also be paid.
This suggests, says Mr Dominguez, the net annual hard currency gain to Cuba
is between Dollars 100m and Dollars 300m.
While this compares with the Dollars 220m earned in 1992 from nickel
exports, it is still significantly less than its earnings from sugar
exports, even though they fell to their lowest level this year since 1963.
This year's harvest of 4.2m tonnes would generate Dollars 800m-Dollars 900m
in export revenues.
'Tourism, as at present structured, offers only very limited relief to
Cuba's economic crisis,' argues La Sociedad Economica. This could change if
Americans were allowed to go to Cuba - but the end of the US embargo still
appears a long way off.

Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications operator, said yesterday it
planned to enter into 'intensive co-operation' with Unisource, the joint
venture linking the telecom companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and
Switzerland.
The move is widely regarded as a first step towards Telefonica's taking an
equity stake in Unisource, which is aimed at providing one-stop
telecommunications services to the world's multinationals.
PTT Telecom, the Dutch shareholder in Unisource, said: 'We don't rule out
the possibility that Telefonica will become a shareholder at a later stage.'
Unisource is fighting to establish itself in the field of 'outsourcing' in
direct competition with similar ventures by AT&amp;T, British Telecom, Deutsche
Telekom and France Telecom.
Its co-operation with Telefonica will be exclusive, meaning that the Spanish
company will not be able to enter into deals with Unisource's competitors.
In October, Unisource concluded a non-exclusive alliance with Kokusai
Denshin Denwa, Japan's biggest telephone operator, which left the Japanese
company free to continue its involvement in the 'Worldsource' venture
launched by AT&amp;T in the spring.
Under a co-operation agreement signed yesterday, Telefonica will provide
customer support to Unisource's clients in Spain, while the Unisource
partners will look after Telefonica's clients outside Spain.
The agreement with Telefonica is important to Unisource because it opens up
southern Europe and provides access to markets in Latin America. Telefonica
has holdings in telecom operators in Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico.
'The agreement marks a vital step in the internationalisation of Telefonica
and the positioning of Unisource as a leading pan-European
telecommunications supplier,' Unisource said.
Unisource is continuing to look for a possible equity partner on the North
American market. A commercial agreement with Sprint, the US carrier, on the
use of telephone lines is set to expire at the end of this year.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Cocaine trafficker Escobar shot dead

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pablo Escobar, chief of the Medelln drug cartel, and probably the most
wanted man in the world, was killed by a special task force yesterday
afternoon in Medelln, Colombia.
The task force surrounded the house where he was hiding in a residential
area of the city, bodyguards opened fire on the police and Escobar was shot
as he tried to escape over a roof. Two of Escobar's men were apparently
killed with him. General Octavio Vargas, commander of the task force, said
the house had been located on the basis of intelligence.
The death of Escobar, 44, is very important for President Cesar Gaviria, not
just because Escobar was responsible for smuggling thousands of tonnes of
cocaine and killing hundreds of people, but because his escape from jail in
July 1992 left the government looking incompetent, foolish and corruptible.
The US embassy in Bogota immediately issued a communique congratulating the
Gaviria government on its success.
Although Pablo Escobar's trafficking organisation had virtually collapsed as
his henchmen were killed or captured over the past 16 months, he continued
to hold Colombia in thrall. His terrorist tactics, with massive car bombs,
kidnappings and selective political assassinations, made people feel that
he, rather than the government, was in control of the country.
Escobar started as a small-time thief and gunman and began to build up the
cocaine trafficking business in the late 1970s. By the mid-1980s the Medelln
cartel had become a powerful trafficking and crime organisation and Escobar
had amassed one of the biggest fortunes in the world.
In 1991 he surrendered to the authorities after bargaining for easy terms
and ensuring that he would be guarded by his own men.
When he escaped from jail a year later it was clear that he had been living
in luxury and running his business from the prison. Since then he had been
on the run.
The government is hailing this as a big victory in the fight against
drug-trafficking. However, the Cali groups have already taken over most of
the cocaine traffic.

Federal agents posing as corrupt contractors have begun a wide-ranging
investigation into charges of fraud and kickbacks at the US space agency's
Johnson Space Centre, law enforcement officials said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Houston.
The investigation has targeted several large government contractors,
employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and more than
a dozen employees of private companies, the officials said.
However, the officials were unable to confirm reports that the case may
involve an astronaut. The FBI allegedly shot videotapes of contractors
accepting cash to set up illegal deals with Nasa.
According to local media reports, those caught in the scheme, in which
payments reportedly amounted to tens of thousands of dollars, include
contractors and vendors as well as an astronaut.
The investigation was described as the biggest probe into allegations of
government contract corruption since 'Operation Ill Wind', a massive FBI
investigation in the late 1980s into bribery and other wrong-doing in the
Pentagon's procurement system.
Word of the investigation came as Nasa launched the space shuttle Endeavour
yesterday on a mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope - a mission that
officials also hoped would improve the agency's already sagging reputation
after a recent string of failed missions.
The US Attorney General's office in Houston declined to comment on the
investigation.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Yucatan faces political turmoil

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican state of Yucatan has fallen into political turmoil after last
Sunday's disputed elections for governor, in which independent observers and
the opposition alleged widespread fraud.
Ms Dulce Maria Sauri - the governor of Yucatan and a member of Mexico's
ruling Institutional Revolutionary party - 16 members of her cabinet, and a
federal deputy submitted their resignations on Wednesday. The governor said
she was unable to carry out her responsibilities as head of the state
executive.
The opposition is planning further protests at what it and independent
observers claim was widespread fraud. It demanded that the elections be
annulled and held again next August.
While the government-controlled state election commission had not given out
official results by yesterday morning, the PRI was claiming a convincing
victory in the gubernatorial election. In the election for mayor of Merida,
the state capital, both the PRI and the opposition said they were ahead.
Diario Yucatan, an independent newspaper in Merida, said the governor
resigned after officials in Mexico City asked her to concede to the
centre-right opposition the election for mayor in Merida.
Independent observers in Yucatan catalogued a series of irregularities in a
random sample of 250 voting booths, out of a total 1,400. In 115 of the
booths there was no guarantee of a secret vote; in 101 there was pressure to
vote for the ruling party; some 292 people voted without credentials; and
292 who wanted to vote could not. Under state law, if there are
irregularities in more than 20 per cent of the voting booths, elections have
to be cancelled.
'Nobody at this moment can assure that the elections were legitimate,' said
Mr Julio Faesler, president of Council for Democracy. 'The situation is in
sharp contrast to the promises of democracy made at the federal level.'

FT  03 DEC 93 / Chile 'bored by democracy': Indifference to coming national
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After only four years of it, Chileans appear to be taking democracy for
granted. With presidential and parliamentary elections due this month, 47
per cent of the electorate declare themselves either 'indifferent to' or
'bored with' politics, according to the results of a nationwide poll.
If responses such as 'no confidence' or 'don't know' are added, the
percentage of those disgruntled with politics reaches 75. Furthermore, the
Centre for the Study of Contemporary Reality, which organised the poll,
predicts that 10 per cent of registered voters (who are obliged by law to
vote) will spoil their ballot papers.
'If this trend continues,' says Mrs Marta Lagos, director of Cerc, 'it would
mean a significant change in our political culture, which formerly displayed
a strong tendency towards participation in all types of electoral activity.'
Such indifference is difficult to fathom in a nation denied access to
democratic institutions for 17 years of military rule. Some commentators
argue that democratic habits take time to be re-learned, while others
believe that General Augusto Pinochet's most important legacy has been the
'de-politicisation' of a once polemical nation.
The elections of December 11 - which should result three months later in the
first handover from one democratic government to another since Salvador
Allende became president in 1970 - are hardly designed to animate a bored
populace. The result - a victory for Mr Eduardo Frei, candidate of the
governing Concertacion coalition - has been a foregone conclusion for
months, given the relative popularity of the current administration and
ideological disarray on the right.
All recent polls give Mr Frei about 60 per cent of the vote against less
than 20 per cent for his nearest rival, Mr Arturo Alessandri, candidate of
the right-wing Union for Chilean Progress. The remaining four presidential
candidates score about 10 per cent between them, with another 10 per cent
undecided.
Mrs Lagos believes that the polls falsely inflate the Concertacion vote at
the expense of support for Mr Alessandri whom she expects to poll 26-30 per
cent on December 11. However, she is certain Mr Frei will do enough to avoid
run-off elections in February. He needs to win more than 50 per cent.
Mrs Lagos also believes there will be few changes in the make-up of
congress. As things stand, the Concertacion has 58 per cent of deputies and
48 per cent of senators. This has proved enough to govern, but not to push
through controversial legislation or to amend Gen Pinochet's 1980
constitution, which awards disproportionate power to the right-wing
opposition.
Dramatic shifts in allegiance are unlikely given the absence of stirring
issues. In 1989 Chileans chose between politicians who had aligned
themselves with the military regime and those who had led the campaign for a
return to democracy.
By contrast, in this year's campaign it is difficult to distinguish among
the views of mainstream candidates. All of them support continuation of the
neo-liberal economic model and express the same concerns over perceived
social ills.
For the most part, the issues that do provoke electoral interest - such as
poverty, poor housing, unemployment and crises in the health and education
systems - are those where the right is considered weakest. Part of the
electorate may be disgruntled with the Concertacion's performance in these
areas but, other than vote for the extreme left, it feels it has little
alternative but to support the status quo.
The one area in which the right is considered more competent is that of
battling crime. According to Cerc findings, a quarter of the population
believes that the spread of delinquency is the nation's biggest problem,
although concrete evidence suggests crime may actually be falling.
Nevertheless, Mr Alessandri is campaigning hard on the issue, suggesting
that Concertacion policies have led to a breakdown of law and order.
Of the alternative candidates, the ideas of environmentalist Mr Manfred
Max-Neef appear to have struck the loudest chord. Although Mr Max-Neef, who
derides what he sees as Chile's blind pursuit of economic growth, is polling
only about 3 per cent, Cerc believes he could attract 5 per cent of the
final vote.
The other three candidates are Father Eugenio Pizarro, representing the
communist-led Mida coalition, Mr Cristian Reitze, candidate of a
green-humanist coalition, and Mr Jose Pinera, a former minister of Gen
Pinochet and independent right-wing candidate.
Such diversity of opinions is unlikely to have much effect on the outcome,
especially since the constitution is designed to reward coalitions and
punish small parties. Furthermore, Chile's recent turbulent history seems
not to have affected basic political allegiances which divide the population
into roughly equal blocks of left, centre and right.
If the result of the poll is in little doubt, one thing remains shrouded in
mystery. With less than 30 days to go before elections, it is still not
clear how long Chile's next president will serve. Various attempts to cut
the presidential term from its current eight years have foundered on the
rocks of party bickering.
Mr Frei has said that, if elected, he would ask congress to reduce the
period to four years. But, he warned, if parliament could not agree to do so
by March 1994, when the new administration takes over, he felt disposed to
serve out his full eight years.
There is certain to be public pressure for congress to put aside its
differences and cut the presidential term. For an electorate already bored
with its politicians, the prospect of having the same president for eight
years is not a thrilling one.

<TEXT>
US consumer spending is growing faster than personal incomes, suggesting the
pace of economic growth could moderate in the first half of next year as
people rebuild depleted savings, official figures indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.4 per cent in real
terms between September and October, twice the rate of growth of real,
after-tax personal incomes.
In the past year, real spending has grown by 3.2 per cent against a 1.8 per
cent increase in disposable incomes.
The personal savings rate fell to 3.7 per cent in October, against an
average of 5.3 per cent last year.
Figures for new home sales in October indicated the housing recovery, while
strong, was a little less robust than previously estimated.
New home sales fell 6.5 per cent between September and October to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000. The increase in sales in
September was revised down to show a gain of 14.8 per cent rather than the
initially reported 20.8 per cent. In the first 10 months of the year, new
homes sales were up 6 per cent from the same period last year.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Congress backing sought in foreign aid drive
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Clinton administration officials are due to meet congressional leaders today
to launch months of discussion on an overhaul of US foreign aid structures
and procedures.
Mr Brian Atwood, administrator of the US Agency for International
Development (AID), is expected to brief senior members of Congress on the
draft legislation the administration has submitted to simplify aid
programmes and concentrate US foreign aid on a limited number of strategic
themes.
The administration hopes to pass the bill in Congress's next session, early
next year, rewriting a 1961 law.
Under current law, AID pursues 33 separate goals and 75 priority areas.
Instead of this scattered approach, the administration wants to focus on
health, population control, the environment, economic growth and democracy.
Mr Atwood said he hoped discussions over the next few months could bring
consensus on the sort of reform needed. 'There is no doubt that there is a
consensus that we've got to reform our aid programme,' Mr Atwood said in
Washington at a meeting arranged by the newspaper USA Today International.
In the draft proposals submitted to Congress, the administration asks for
more flexibility to deal with changing situations, instead of the 'earmarks'
attached by members of Congress to foreign aid bills to stipulate exactly
where AID must spend its money.
AID will reduce its operations to around 50 countries, eliminating some
whose economies have developed beyond the point where they need concessional
assistance and tying aid to recipients' performance.
Mr Atwood has already announced closure of 21 AID field missions in
countries such as Argentina, Chile, Ivory Coast and Zaire, either because
they are now deemed creditworthy on their own or because they are considered
'poor partners in development' until their undemocratic governments change
their policies.
Nevertheless, the US will continue to aid a dozen countries for more
strategic reasons. Israel and Egypt, biggest aid recipients today, will
continue to receive money, as will the former Soviet Union.

FT  03 DEC 93 / OECD urges Japan to reform finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan must make radical financial reforms and curb regulations that cause
artificially high prices if it is to achieve sustainable non-inflationary
growth.
A gradual rise in taxes and social security contributions will also be
needed to prevent an explosion of public debt, as an ageing population
drains the social security budget and reduces government income tax
revenues.
These are the sobering conclusions of yesterday's annual report on Japan by
the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, which adds
intellectual authority to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's attempts to
achieve deregulation against resistance from powerful vested interests.
It also backs up the Finance Ministry's campaign for a wide-ranging tax
reform to spread the burden of income tax more widely and to obtain a
greater share of tax revenues from consumption tax.
Like the Japanese government, the OECD was wrong-footed by the strength of
the recession. The report predicts zero growth in gross domestic product
this year, down from its original 2.5 per cent growth forecast, and
forecasts that the economy will grow by 1.4 per cent in 1994.
But since the report was compiled in September, OECD officials have
downgraded their forecasts again, to less than zero growth this year and
well below 1 per cent next. 'Developments since the preparation of the
report have been significant,' said Mr Kumi Shigehara, the OECD's chief
economist, yesterday.
Unlike previous recessions, this one was caused by domestic upsets - the
unsustainable asset price and investment boom of the late 1980s - which take
time to put right, says the report. The yen's unexpected strength this year
added a new shock.
Unemployment will rise from 2.5 per cent this year to 2.9 per cent next,
while inflation will slow from 1 per cent this year to 0.4 per cent,
forecasts the OECD. The balance of payments surplus, will peak at a record
Dollars 140.8bn this year and recede to Dollars 139.7bn in 1994.
US pressure for numerical import targets to reduce the surplus is dangerous
because such targets would encourage cartels and distract efforts to
deregulate and boost competition in sheltered industries, the OECD warns.
The weakness of the banking system, hit by the need to write off a growing
pile of bad debts, has not so far proved a serious restraint on recovery,
because credit demand has been even weaker than supply, despite the Bank of
Japan's cuts in the official discount rate to new lows. But the OECD fears
the banks' cost of own funds could rise as they exhaust sources of capital,
so driving up corporate finance costs.
A sustained stock market rise would relieve the squeeze on the banks'
capital base. One answer would be to make the stock market more attractive
to individuals by improving corporate disclosure, increasing dividends and
deregulating commission rates, says the OECD.
The key to stimulating domestic demand - set to grow by a mere 0.1 per cent
this year - in the medium term is to sweep away regulations that distort
land, housing and food prices. This would also help to reduce Japan's high
savings rate, criticised by trade partners as a factor in the high trade
surplus, the organisation argues.
The study says the government should derive a higher proportion of state
income from consumption tax. It stops short of calling for a substantial
income tax cut, seen by Japanese business lobbies as the only way to
stimulate demand, though it does believe income tax schedules for heavily
taxed middle-income earners could be reduced.
Today, the Japanese government gets 68.3 per cent of its tax revenues from
income tax - as against the 38.5 per cent OECD average. The burden on income
tax payers will increase as the percentage of people over 65 rises from just
over 12 per cent now to 25.5 per cent in 2020. There would be scope for a
reduction in rates if the income tax base was widened, to include 'more
effective' taxes on capital gains.
Consumption tax, at 3 per cent is very low by international standards, and
inefficiently collected. Simplified consumption tax accounting rules for
businesses were introduced to make this tax less unpopular on its launch in
1988, but the 60 per cent of traders which qualify for simplified procedures
tend to underpay.

Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, yesterday sought to end the row

Mr Keating made his remarks in response to questions about Dr Mahathir's

the affair has got worse. Last weekend, Malaysia banned Australian
television programmes and commercials; this week, it stopped future
government scholarship holders from going to Australia.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China said yesterday that the decision by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's
governor, to proceed unilaterally with electoral reforms had ruined
prospects for negotiations.
Mr Patten told Hong Kong's Legislative Council that he could no longer wait
for agreement after 17 rounds of talks in Beijing on his reform proposals
and that he would put 'less contentious' parts of his plans to Legco on
December 15. However, he said he had not broken off talks with Beijing.
'We're prepared to go on talking and our team will never be the one that
walks away from the negotiating table, never,' he said. British officials
said Beijing had not replied to a request for a round of talks on December
17 and 18.
Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong, told reporters in Beijing
that if Mr Patten tabled a reform bill, talks on the colony's future would
be broken off.
He said: 'If Britain puts its package to Legco, no matter if it is a
complete package or a partial package, this will mean that Britain has
unilaterally broken the talks.'
This was the most specific warning yet from a senior Chinese official of the
consequences of Mr Patten going ahead with reforms aimed at broadening the
franchise for elections due in 1994 and 1995.
Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, informed his British counterpart,
Mr Douglas Hurd, this week that Beijing would end the discussions if Mr
Patten proceeded with his reforms in defiance of Beijing's strong
objections. China will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
Mr Patten said there could be no further delay because the government had to
begin drawing up electoral rolls and defining constituency boundaries.
However, he insisted he remained open to negotiations. 'Any proposals we
receive from the Chinese side we'd have to consider very carefully,' he
said.
The bill to be introduced on December 15 would reduce the voting age to 18
from 21, abolish government-appointed local councillors and introduce
single-member legislative constituencies.
More controversial elements of the governor's plans, including broadening
the franchise for some seats in Legco in elections in 1995, would be set
aside until next year.
Mr Wu Jianmin, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned the collapse
of the talks could affect business relations. His remarks mirrored similar
observations earlier in the year by Chinese leaders, including Premier Li
Peng.
'Economic relations are part of Sino-British relations,' Mr Wu said. 'They
are affected because of the Hong Kong question.'
China has previously retaliated economically against countries which
displease it. The most recent example was a freeze placed on business with
France last year after the French announced they were selling advanced
Mirage fighter bombers to Taiwan.
China last month squeezed Britain's GEC out of an underground railway deal
in Guangzhou, the southern Chinese city. Beijing's intervention ensured the
main contract went to Siemens of Germany, in spite of reports that local
officials favoured GEC-Alsthom.
Since the 17th round of Sino-British talks ended in stalemate in Beijing on
Saturday, each side has blamed the other. China has accused Britain of being
responsible for the 'failure', while British officials insist that China
used the protracted talks in Beijing as a smokescreen for inaction.
China has denounced Mr Patten's proposed reforms and has threatened to
disregard elections held under the Patten formula. It says the reforms run
counter to agreements reached in previous negotiations. However, Britain
insists they do not violate either the 1984 Joint Declaration or the Basic
Law, China's post-1997 constitution for Hong Kong.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Patten bears in mind where his popularity comes from: Limits
to governor's room to move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there was one thing which came out of Governor Chris Patten's speech to
Hong Kong's Legislative Council yesterday it was the attention he and his
top advisers pay to public opinion in the colony.
Hong Kong's willingness to stick by Mr Patten, in open opposition to China's
wishes, has become a limiting factor on the governor's room to manoeuvre and
partly explains why yesterday he said he would be introducing only part of
his democracy plans on December 15, leaving the more contentious issues to a
later bill.
The governor told LegCo his administration would introduce a bill to:
lower Hong Kong's voting age to 18 from 21 years;
abolish appointments to local government so that elections for district
boards and municipal councils would be conducted on a fully democratic basis
in 1994 and 1995;
allow Hong Kong delegates to 'people's congresses', the mainland's
rubber-stamping legislatures, to stand for election in Hong Kong;
legislate for a third of LegCo's 60 seats to be drawn from 20 single-member
constituencies.
Mr Patten is fond of pointing out that his colleagues in the British
government would die for his popularity ratings. But this disguises a
shrewder calculation: that a Hong Kong governor's popularity is only skin
deep, especially just 3 1/2 years away from the resumption of Chinese
sovereignty.
The governor admitted as much when asked what he would put in this
yet-to-be-drafted second bill. Would it be his original 1992 proposals for
broadening the democratic franchise, or the compromise offer made during
talks at which he backed away from those plans?
'We've got to try to find the broadest ground on which to pitch our tents,'
he said.
His close aide on constitutional matters, Mr Michael Sze, secretary for
constitutional affairs, stressed this point when commenting on why Mr Patten
had decided to wait 11 days to table the first bill.
'As a local citizen of Hong Kong, I think the community, especially in light
of its reaction to March 12, would expect us to act in a measured manner,'
he said.
This is a reference to the momentary evaporation of public support when Mr
Patten went to the wall last March for Hong Kong representation - especially
Mr Sze's - at bilateral talks about the colony's political future. Opinion
polls showed that if faced with a choice between representation at the talks
or negotiations, Hong Kong's community would choose the latter.
China has told Britain that it will break off talks about Hong Kong's
political development if Mr Patten tables his first-stage bill. Such a
threat will no doubt unsettle public opinion and the business community, but
on these narrow issues Beijing's threats are unlikely to persuade Legco
members not to support it.
So Mr Patten can feel relatively confident that he has this support. There
is no political party in LegCo with a representation greater than two
members that opposes these measures.
Conservative members, notably those aligned with the Liberal party, will no
doubt come under pressure from the Xinhua news agency, Beijing's bulwark in
the colony, to oppose the governor's bill. But Mr Allen Lee, the Liberal
leader, has said publicly too often that his party supports the measures
contained in the first-stage bill for them to back down.
Beijing will also run the risk of looking wholly unreasonable if it opposes
the first bill, especially given that it allows Hong Kong delegates to its
own National People's Congress and other congresses to serve on LegCo. Hong
Kong law currently prohibits those serving in a legislature of another
territory from standing for public office.
Where Mr Patten's difficulties will lie, and where China's influence in
LegCo is predominant, is on measures which will be included in the second
bill, which goes to the heart of Mr Patten's attempt to increase democracy
in Hong Kong. These concern broadening the franchise in LegCo's 30
'functional constituencies' (industry votes) and possibly on the structure
of an election committee that will nominate 10 members to the 1995 LegCo.
However, Beijing's veiled threat yesterday to harm Hong Kong's economy will
unsettle the stock market. And in the coming weeks the governor may find
that he receives indirect support from a source that is usually opposed to
his plans: the business community.
Many of China's advisers are leading tycoons in the colony; many of the
children of China's most senior leaders have, or manage, large family
investments in Hong Kong. This coalition of forces opposes what Mr Patten
wants to do, but it also has a keen sense of its and China's economic
self-interest.
The business lobby has proved powerful in the past in staying the hand of
those in the Chinese leadership who might have been tempted to act before
they think. It may yet prove successful again.

Just a week and a half before the scheduled start of Israel's troop
withdrawal from the Gaza and Jericho areas, the Palestine Liberation
Organisation yesterday called on the US to help break the impasse in
autonomy negotiations, warning that the December 13 deadline for the start
of autonomy was 'sacred'.
Israeli officials, by contrast, strenuously played down any talk of a
crisis, with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin insisting that a delay of a few
weeks would not be too serious, and reiterating Israel's commitment to
completing its military pullout by next April.
Crucial autonomy questions - concerning the size of the Jericho autonomous
region, how the army will redeploy in Gaza to protect Jewish settlers there,
responsibility for border crossings, and more - have yet to be resolved at
the Cairo Israeli-PLO negotiations. Mr Nabil Sha'ath, chief PLO negotiator,
left the Egyptian capital yesterday for Tunis declaring the Israelis were
deliberately angling for an 11th-hour deal 'in an attempt to reap the
maximum benefits'.
The PLO's appeal for American intervention, which came at the end of a
two-day leadership meeting in Tunis, may well be answered. Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, is due to begin a Middle East visit
today. Mr Sha'ath said Mr Christopher would meet Mr Arafat in Amman on
Monday, and again in Tunis later in the week.
In the occupied territories themselves, meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and
wounded two Palestinians in a car near Gaza City. Hundreds of Jewish
settlers rioted in the Arab West Bank town of Hebron, firing shots into the
air and smashing house and car windows.

<TEXT>
Most of South Africa's senior businessmen would like to see Mr Nelson
Mandela, the African National Congress leader, as president of South Africa,
and they are overwhelmingly optimistic about the future.
These are the somewhat surprising findings of a survey of top business
people conducted last month for the South African Chamber of Business, the
Weekly Mail and Guardian newspaper, and the South African Broadcasting
Corporation.
Professor Mark Orkin of the Community Agency for Social Enquiry, who
conducted the research, said it showed top business figures 'have already
embraced the political future and are optimistic about the business
prospects heralded by an ANC-led government'.
The core finding is optimism about the future, with 85 per cent of
respondents predicting an optimistic future for their children or
grandchildren. In the short term, 87 per cent of respondents felt the
outlook for business was improving and 71 per cent felt it would improve
further after the election. The main reason offered for short-term optimism
was the increased certainty and stability that would follow an election.
A surprising finding was that 68 per cent of respondents said they would
'most like' Mr Mandela for president. This compared with 32 per cent for
President F W de Klerk and no support for Chief Buthelezi, leader of the
Inkatha Freedom party.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Illness forces Sony's Morita aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, and Japan's best known international
business ambassador, has temporarily given up business activities as a
result of a brain haemorrhage.
Sony announced the move yesterday, two days after Mr Morita, 72, was taken
to hospital after collapsing while playing tennis at home. This will have
little impact on Sony's day-to-day operations, since he handed over the
group presidency - the top executive job - to Mr Norio Ohga four years ago.
But it could upset the balance of power at the top of business community at
a moment when its influence on government policy is growing. Mr Morita was
expected to succeed Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren employers'
association and head of a government advisory panel on deregulation, next
May.
It would take some time for Mr Morita to recover, but there was no
indication that he would give up business activities, said Mr Tsunao
Hashimoto, vice president of Sony, denying suggestions that Mr Morita had
resigned from the Keidanren.
Mr Morita, said to have refused the job of foreign minister in the current
government, is an advocate of a more internationally open Japan and an
outspoken opponent of US criticisms of Japanese trade policies. He is also a
tough critic of management weaknesses at Sony's US and European competitors.
The heir to a family sake-brewing business in Nagoya, Mr Morita built up
Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation after the war, with his
partner, the engineer Mr Masaru Ibuka. They later named the group Sony,
based on the Latin for sound.
Mr Morita is credited with being the marketing force behind Sony innovations
from the tape recorder to the Walkman, and providing the inspiration for
Sony's move into the entertainment software business, with the acquisitions
of CBS Records in 1988 and Columbia Pictures of Hollywood in 1989.
Mr Morita also ensured that Sony was the first to move into home video
recorders. But it stuck to its Betamax system long after it was clear that
the competing VHS system, developed by JVC, had captured the market - often
cited as an example of Mr Morita's stubbornness.

FT  03 DEC 93 / G7 help waits on Russian elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Group of Seven leading industrialised countries have prepared a battery
of support measures for Russian reform, which will be activated after the
election on December 12 - assuming the reformists win.
A senior US official said yesterday in Moscow: 'Clearly, after the elections
there will be major opportunities to consolidate progress and we can say
that the G7 are poised to help and to help rapidly, if the conditions are
there.'
Support for reform in Russia depends heavily on the poll's outcome. Opinion
surveys indicate dwindling support for Russia's Choice, the leading party
and main reformist group, and a rise in support for the Communists and far
right.
The initiatives now being prepared for after the elections by the G7
include:
A waiving by the World Bank for the first time of its 'negative pledge'
rule, which means dropping its insistence that a country repay the bank
before other creditors. The board is expected to approve the decision on
December 14, two days after the election. The senior official said this
would release a flood of investment held up during long discussions within
the bank on dropping its time-honoured rule.
The first fruit of this is a framework agreement designed by the US Eximbank
to provide loans of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) or more to Russian buyers in
the oil and gas industries of US equipment, the loans secured against hard
currency payments to escrow accounts for future oil and gas deliveries. This
form of agreement, essentially a type of barter, would not be possible under
the bank's negative pledge rule.
Mr Thomas Pickering, US ambassador, said yesterday the agreement was the
base for further foreign investment in energy and other fields. 'There must
be no doubt of the desire on the part of US industry to play the leading
role in extending assistance to Russia in the exploitation of its oil
wealth.'
A meeting of the G7 'sherpas', or senior civil servants, in Paris in the
week after elections to review progress in reforms and prepare further
assistance. Included in the future aid is a Dollars 3bn fund designed to
support privatised companies with investment and advice, and the second
Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the International Monetary Fund's systemic
transformation facility, delayed for some months as reform veered off track.
Visits to Moscow immediately after the election by US Vice President Al Gore
and in January by President Bill Clinton for a summit with President Boris
Yeltsin.
The US official said: 'In spite of everything, 1993 has been a good year for
Russian economic reform: real wages went up three times in dollar terms,
inflation has come down from 30 to 15 per cent a month, privatisation has
meant that one third of the workforce now works in the private sector. And
1994 could be a decisive year for Russia.' However, much depends on the
outcome in the fourth quarter of the year.
Reuter adds: Two Russian opposition parties were given the green light
yesterday to fight the election. The central electoral commission rejected a
request from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, to ban the
Communist party and a centrist Democratic Party of Russia from the polls.

The Bosnian government said yesterday that talks on the republic's ethnic
partition were on the brink of collapse because the Serbs had made no
territorial concessions, writes Laura Silber in Geneva. After a series of
bilateral meetings on the two-way division of Sarajevo with their Bosnian
Serb adversaries, Mr Mohamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's UN ambassador, said, 'It
seems that the Serbs are not willing to give anything'. However, Mr Radovan
Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said the two sides were close to a settlement
on the capital.
Michael Littlejohns adds from the UN: Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, co-chairman
with Lord Owen of the conference on former Yugoslavia, is being relieved of
his other responsibilities as special representative of the UN secretary
general. He will be succeeded by Mr Yasushi Akashi, whose direction of the
recent UN peacekeeping operations in Cambodia was widely praised.
A spokesman for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary general, said Mr
Stoltenberg's heavy involvement in peace negotiations left him too little
time to discharge the duties of chief of mission of the UN protection force
and special UN representative.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank surprised European financial markets yesterday by announcing
a quarter of a percentage point cut in the securities repurchase agreement,
the 'repo' rate which determines money market interest rates, without
lowering the 'official' Lombard and discount rates, writes David Waller in
Frankfurt.
The bank's council fixed the repo rate at 6 per cent for the next five
weeks, down from 6.25 per cent. Although markets were initially disappointed
about the discount rate, the repo rate cut was enough to trigger a round of
easing in other European countries. The Dutch and Belgian central banks
announced they would cut rates from today: the Dutch by a quarter point and
the Belgians by between a quarter and half a point.
The German rate cut move comes against a background of slowing inflation and
economic stagnation in the country.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Nato closer to military co-operation with eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation yesterday moved closer to agreeing
concrete plans for military co-operation with eastern European countries,
amid a consensus that the alliance was not yet ready for the admission of
new members, writes David White, Defence Correspondent, in Brussels.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said countries actively
involved in the 'partnership for peace' agreements proposed by Washington
should have permanent representatives at Nato and join a special planning
cell at Mons in Belgium, the site of Nato's European military headquarters.
At a Nato foreign ministers' meeting he said eastern European partners would
train and exercise with Nato armies, and develop common military standards
and procedures. Joint action could include peacekeeping and humanitarian
missions.
Nato officials said the US proposal, due to be formally endorsed at an
allied summit next month, received strong backing from the 16 allies. But at
the same time there was unanimity that enlargement of the alliance was 'not
on the immediate agenda'.
In a bid to soothe Russian suspicions about an expansion of Nato to former
Warsaw Pact countries, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary,
emphasised the need for 'a strong relationship' between Nato and Moscow.
Although the new plan is aimed at all countries of the former eastern bloc,
the UK is understood to oppose forming a partnership agreement with Ukraine
until it joints the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Allies have yet to agree on which other European countries may be included
in the plan and on how partner nations would consult Nato in a crisis.
Mr Christopher said eastern European states would be expected to finance
their involvement, but 'some new Nato resources' would be needed. He added
that the agreements 'could be a key step towards Nato membership'.
Allies also backed a US proposal for Nato joint task forces to be formed for
peacekeeping and other missions outside alliance territory.
These task forces would include units from France and Spain, which do not
belong to Nato's integrated military structure.
More detailed plans are due to be ready by next month.

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats
in Germany is facing unprecedented internal strife, amid open speculation
about its ability to survive to the next general election, less than 11
months away.
The fragile alliance won a brief respite yesterday when the CDU candidate
for premier in the east German state of Saxony-Anhalt, Mr Christoph Bergner,
was narrowly elected to form a government, thanks to total disarray in FDP
ranks.
Yet the speculation about active plotting within the FDP to bring down the
coalition in Bonn as well as in Saxony-Anhalt, allegedly involving Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, forced his successor,
Mr Klaus Kinkel, party leader, to issue a vigorous denial.
The CDU-FDP split in the eastern state has merely brought to a head tensions
at national level. At the same time there is growing evidence of dissent
within the CDU itself, and criticism of the chancellor's role, in spite of
the fact that no one can propose a realistic alternative to lead the party
in the next election.
The most outspoken criticism has come from Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the
left-leaning CDU premier of Saxony, who warned yesterday that the opposition
Social Democrats were set to win next year's elections.
Yet the most serious evidence of party division, as far as the chancellor is
concerned, has emerged from unnamed senior members of the leadership in the
columns of the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper. Even his close
allies are speculating on how to stop the dramatic decline in party fortunes
and prevent a series of humiliating defeats in local and national elections.
In an extraordinary front page report yesterday, the newspaper quoted one
'leading CDU politician' as comparing the situation to 1982, when the FDP
under Mr Genscher abandoned its coalition with the SPD, and formed a new

FT  03 DEC 93 / Parties try to fan east's fading fires: Voter interest in
Brandenburg's poll is low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political parties in the east German state of Brandenburg may disagree with
one another on many issues, but one concern unites them: fear of a low
turnout in next Sunday's local government elections, the first since
unification. More than 30 per cent of the electorate have yet to decide
which party they will vote for - or even if they will vote at all.
'You would imagine people would jump at the chance to vote,' says Mr Thomas
Klein, general secretary of the opposition Christian Democratic Union.
His party needs all the votes it can muster. A recent opinion poll gave it
only 9 per cent, compared to 29.4 per cent in 1990's state elections. The
Free Democrats, the CDU's junior partner in the Bonn coalition, is expected
to get a miserable 3 per cent, compared to 6.6 per cent in 1990.
'These polls, and the election results, are a signal for the way in which
eastern Germany could vote in next year's state and federal elections,' says
Mr Klein, who helped organise the CDU's 1990 campaign in Brandenburg.
Social Democrats in Brandenburg, the only one of the five eastern states the
party controls, are expected to win 36 per cent of the vote, slightly less
than in 1990. But party activists are taking no chances. Election posters
drum home the message: 'We call on all citizens to participate.'
Mr Manfred Stolpe, Brandenburg's prime minister and an east German, keeps
returning to this theme in his speeches: 'Voting matters. It will strengthen
democracy. If you throw away your vote, others will make the decisions.'
What has compounded the fear of a poor turnout is the low level of political
participation. 'Here in Brandenburg, elections cannot be held in one in five
local communities and councils because we can't find a candidate. Nobody
wants to stand,' says Mr Klein.
'There are all sorts of reasons for this strange phenomenon,' he adds.
'People were forced to participate politically over the past 40 years. Many
aspects of their lives were politicised.' This partly explains low
membership of political parties. The SPD has 6,000 paid-up members, the CDU
11,500, Free Democrats 3,000, Greens 750, and the Party of Democratic
Socialists (PDS), or reformed Communists, has 20,000, 90 per cent of them
former Communists.
Mr Wolfgang Thierse, an east Berliner and a senior member of the SPD, says:
'This is a worrying trend. We are finding it difficult to create new, local
political elites, not only in Brandenburg but throughout eastern Germany. It
will take time. But the political parties themselves must work harder at
local level.'
What worries the established parties is that a low turnout will play into
the hand of the PDS. It is not that they expect a return to
Socialist-dominated governments, even at the local level. 'What it means,'
says a senior SPD official, 'is that the PDS could have a bargaining
position when it comes to forming coalition local government councils, and
that's a slap in the face for the centre and the old status quo. Unless the
CDU and SPD join forces.'
Indeed, the PDS, which inherited the Communist party's organisation and
structure, might even take Potsdam, the state capital, from the SPD.
Says Mr Lothar Nicht, PDS party manager in Brandenburg: 'People all know us.
We are all locals.' More than 90 per cent of the party's 23,000 paid-up
members are former Communists. In Mr Nicht's view there is no need to defend
his party's record before unification. 'The PDS has now broken with the
past.'
The far right, consisting of the Republicans and the Democratic League, have
only eight candidates standing in three towns. 'We don't expect them to play
a big role,' says Mr Klein. But officials across the political spectrum say
the inhabitants of these towns, which include Eisenhuttenstadt, whose
loss-making steel mill threatens further redundancies, and the lignite mines
near Cottbus, could be vulnerable to the populist slogans of the extreme
right and the PDS.
According to Ms Petra Weissflog, spokeswoman for the Greens/Bundis 90:
'People don't trust the politicians. . . They are also disappointed with
unification, especially the high level of unemployment. They do not have
much of a perspective. They have other things to think about besides
listening to politicians who cannot deliver on their promises.'
Brandenburg's unemployment rate is nearly 20 per cent.
'Why should we trust anyone?' asks Mr Horst Wegner, a 39-year-old lorry
driver. 'Look at those Wessis (westerners) running Saxony-Anhalt, and
fiddling their expenses. They don't need the money. And we don't need them.
If I bother to vote, it will for one of us, and none of those Wessis.'
Whether that meant voting for the far right, the PDS or Mr Stolpe, he would
not say.

Turkey's consumer boom continues apace with the trade deficit reaching
Dollars 10bn in the third quarter, according to figures released yesterday.
In the nine months to September, imports rose to Dollars 21bn, up 30 per
cent over the same period in 1992, and almost as much as for the whole of
last year. Exports were up just 1.5 per cent over 1992 at Dollars 10.7bn.
While the rest of Europe pulls slowly out of recession, Turkey is enjoying
strong growth fuelled by easier domestic credit and increased foreign
capital inflows.
In the third quarter gross national product grew by 7.9 per cent, against 12
per cent in the second quarter. Growth for the year is projected at 8 per
cent. Vehicle output is 27 per cent higher than in 1992.

FT  03 DEC 93 / France to reform pension system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is to introduce legislation to reform the country's
pension system by next spring, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister,
said yesterday.
The reform would involve the establishment of powerful pension funds and
would be aimed at easing the burden on the state pension system. It would
also provide a significant new source of funds for the stock market and
assist the government's ambitious privatisation programme.
'As long as privatisations are important, our country must have funds which
have a large part of their holdings in shares,' Mr Alphandery said,
referring to the government's plans to sell 21 publicly-owned companies over
the next five years.
The state pension system is under strong pressure as contributions from the
workforce fall short of requirements for the country's ageing population.
Earlier this year, the government passed legislation to extend from 37.5
years to 40 years the period which people need to work to qualify for a full
state pension and recalculated this full pension on the average of a
person's 25 best-paid years rather than the previous 10-year duration.
But the deficit in the pension system, which stood at more than FFr15bn
(Pounds 1.71bn) last year, has increased pressures for a more fundamental
reform and a shift towards capitalised private pensions, as in the US and
UK, rather than France's existing 'pay as you go' system.
Pension reform would also form part of the government's plans to divert
funds from the short-term money market into the corporate sector. The
relatively high level of interest rates in France in recent years has
encouraged the public to place its savings in such Sicav funds. At present,
there is an estimated FFr1,200bn held in these funds.
'French companies have suffered from the tendency to invest in the money
market rather than in stocks' said one French banker. 'Reform of the pension
system is long overdue.'

FT  03 DEC 93 / Row over packaging waste divides EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union environment ministers were last night struggling to find a
compromise on Europe-wide rules for dealing with packaging waste, after the
Belgian presidency of the EU signalled it was prepared to see German-led
insistence on ambitious recycling targets voted down.
Belgium has made it a priority to get through a directive on waste
packaging, after complaints from eight member states that Germany's
ambitious national waste recycling legislation has led to dumping of waste
in neighbouring countries. Germany does not have the capacity to meet its
own targets, and its subsidised exports of waste are stifling efforts
elsewhere to build up recycling industries. France in June threatened a ban
on German waste imports and other member states are warning of legal action.
Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, warned of a 'a
real legal war' if the 12 could not agree common rules. The stakes are high
because if no decision is reached by today, the controversy is likely to
drift through the Greek presidency in the first half of next year, and be
returned to only when Germany itself is in the EU chair during the second
half of 1994. The interim could be punctuated by acrimonious legal disputes.
Moreover, unless the 12 reach a plausible consensus, the European
Parliament, which under the Maastricht treaty could veto this directive,
could further complicate the controversy.
According to Mr Tim Yeo, junior UK environment minister, and French and
European Commission officials, Denmark - which along with the Netherlands
sides with Germany on higher targets - was spearheading a filibuster likely
to take negotiations throughout the night. The German-led trio can, however,
be outvoted under the EU's weighted majority voting system.
The original Commission proposal had been for 60 per cent recovery of waste
over five years, with 40 per cent recycling, and 90 per cent after 10 years,
with 60 per cent recycling. The Belgian presidency compromise abandons the
10-year aim and suggests a 50-60 per cent recovery target, with a 30 to 40
per cent recycling obligation. The latter would be an overall target for all
waste, allowing, say, higher targets for paper and board if there were
insufficient capacity to deal with plastic. But no waste material would be
exempt from the recycling effort, with a minimum 15 per cent target. The
Germans, Dutch and Danes denounced the compromise as unacceptably 'low and
unambitious.'
Negotiations were proceeding last night on French and British suggestions
which would allow the 'greener' member states to set higher targets if there
were no resulting trade and single market distortions of the type already
caused by Germany. Those who wanted higher targets would also have to
demonstrate they had enough reprocessing capacity.

Member states of the European Union should set up a two-chamber European
parliament to improve democratic control of decision-making, according to an
international report published today. This is among a series of
recommendations for a fully fledged European constitution, put forward by a
group of 13 academics and researchers from seven European countries.
The report says the need for a broad public debate on a European
constitution has been underlined by difficulties over ratifying the
Maastricht treaty. In addition, the prospective enlargement of the Union in
coming years requires important changes in EU decision-making.
The study group says the legal basis of the EU has become 'incomprehensible'
as a result of two important amendments to the original Common Market
treaty: the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Neo-fascists set sights on Rome: Seventy years after Il Duce
marched on the Italian capital, the right-wing MSI party hopes Sunday's city
election will catapult it to national prominence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian politics have been electrified by the prospect of two key cities,
Naples and Rome, falling under the control of a party inspired by the
fascist ideals of Benito Mussolini.
The neo-fascist MSI (Italian Social Movement) has a modest chance of winning
the elections for mayor in both cities in Sunday's second round run-off. If
it does, this would represent the biggest single electoral gain by a
right-wing nationalist party in Europe in three decades.
However, the sudden swing to the MSI is likely to be a temporary phenomenon.
It is the product of the collapse of the centre parties and the absence of
alternatives other than the Left. The party itself is ill-equipped to cope
with success. To maintain its momentum it would have to tone down its
intemperate rhetoric, weed out some of the uglier elements in its ranks and
forge links with known moderate voices on the right.
Polls show that Mr Gianfranco Fini, the MSI leader, is commanding just over
46 per cent of the vote in Rome against nearly 54 per cent for Mr Francesco
Rutelli, the Green candidate backed by a left-wing alliance. In Naples, Ms
Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of Il Duce, is running neck and neck
against her rival, Mr Antonio Bassolino, the candidate of the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS).
Under the new local election laws approved in March, there is a run-off
between the two candidates with the most votes when no one obtains an
absolute first round majority. The winner is then entitled to the majority
of council seats to ensure a stable government.
In the first round on November 21, Mr Fini polled 36 per cent of the vote,
Ms Mussolini 30 per cent - both of them running second but enjoying the
largest single party vote. The party also did well in many southern Italian
towns as well as near Rome, and in isolated instances in the north such as
the city of Trieste.
Part of the party's success is due to Mr Fini, a 40-year-old former
journalist who took control of the MSI in 1987. Ambitious, street-wise and
an effective public speaker, Mr Fini has polished the party's image with
more moderate talk. Born seven years after the execution of Il Duce, he
describes himself as a 'post-fascist'.
He chose to stand for election in Rome, where the party has frequently
joined forces with Christian Democrat elements, as a launchpad to project
the party nationwide. Until these elections the MSI had remained a noisy
minority party, averaging about 5 per cent of the vote in general elections
since 1953.
Traditionally the party has been strongest in southern Italy and among what
has been sometimes called the 'clerk class'. Since the end the of the 1960s
the party has also absorbed the Monarchists, giving the current full name
MSI-DN (Destra Nazionale - National Right).
The party has never disowned Mussolini, merely distanced itself from the
fascist regime's excesses. Alessandra Mussolini is open in her admiration
for her grandfather and exploits his name. ( A family detail is that her
famous aunt, actress Sophia Loren, has not publicly supported her
candidacy.)
The MSI actively celebrates the anniversary of Mussolini's march on Rome in
1922 that paved the way for his assumption of absolute power. MSI literature
is tinged with law and order metaphors and by Italy's tolerant standards is
both xenophobic and racist. In the 1960s and 1970s, elements of the party
were linked to right-wing terrorism. More conservative members of the
military also tend to gravitate towards the party.
Against this, the MSI has been fully accepted as a parliamentary party since
1948. In parliament MSI deputies are extremely active and vociferous. Their
concerns have ranged from defence issues to budgetary discipline. Unlike
other extreme-right parties in Europe, the MSI still formally espouses the
state corporatism pioneered by Mussolini.
Most commentators agree that the sudden swing to the MSI has little to with
its policies. Especially in Naples and Rome, voters have deserted the
Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals in protest at
the corruption they practised while running the country. The MSI itself has
been caught in the scandals, but in a lesser way which has not damaged its
image.
But this is not simply a protest vote. Many voters see in the MSI a new
source of patronage. In the specific case of Rome, Mr Fini has won support
because he looks a more decisive figure than his rival, who seems too much
under the wing of the PDS. Surprisingly, little propaganda has been made of
the more unsavoury MSI elements standing for the council. This may yet prove
Mr Fini's weak point in Rome.

The report says the need for a broad public debate on a European

coming years requires important changes in EU decision-making.
The study group includes representatives from universities and research
institutes in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK.
It says the legal basis of the EU has become 'incomprehensible' as a result
of two important amendments to the original Common Market treaty: the Single
European Act and the Maastricht treaty.
Europe needs a constitutional framework to define where European governments
should take on collective powers, and where these powers should best be
exterted at the local and national level, in line with the principle of
subsidiarity, the report says.
The bicameral parliament advocated by the report would add to the present
directly-elected European parliament a second chamber of 175 deputies,
chosen by national parliaments. Their role would be to review the need for
Europe-wide legislation and to check whether proposed laws met
constitutional guidelines.
The report suggests strengthening the Council of Ministers and introducing a
better balance between larger and smaller states through a new system of
majority voting.
The report says the goal of economic and monetary union should be achieved
through 'market process' which exclude any 'artificial deadlines'.
It terms the proposals for Emu in the Maastricht treaty 'ill conceived',
saying: 'They attempted to achieve political union by slight of hand.
Contempt for open debate and for the inconveniences of public opinion is not
the way to build European Union.'

FT  03 DEC 93 / Hanson to float housebuilding side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the industrial group, intends to float its UK and US housebuilding
divisions to cut its debt. The Anglo-US conglomerate may raise more than
Pounds 500m from the two sales, analysts estimate.
The businesses came from Hanson's acquisition of Beazer in 1991, when Beazer
was planning a flotation of the housebuilding activities. Since then, the UK
and US subsidiaries have been expanded through small acquisitions.
A flotation of all of Beazer Homes, the fourth largest housebuilder in the
UK, should go through by the end of March, and might raise more than Pounds
400m. The business made an operating profit of Pounds 42m in Hanson's 1993
figures.
A float of 70 per cent of Beazer Homes USA, which made Pounds 16m, and a
simultaneous offer of Dollars 125m (Pounds 83.8m) of senior notes, should
come earlier.
A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission is likely next week.
Lazard Brothers will sponsor the UK float, with Hoare Govett and James Capel
as brokers.
Hanson made the announcement yesterday with its annual results, which showed
a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.29bn to Pounds 1.02bn in the
year to September 30.
The fall in profits, warnings of much higher interest charges, and Hanson's
failure to increase its quarterly dividend, unsettled the shares, which fell
15 3/4 p to 268 1/2 p.
For the first time, Hanson held a press briefing on its results. Lord
Hanson, the chairman, was not present. The meeting was headed instead by Mr
Derek Bonham, the chief executive and heir-apparent.
Profits were depressed by the US coal strike, which cost Pounds 125m in the
year; by a fall in exceptional profits from Pounds 172m to Pounds 24m; and
by a Pounds 32m drop in interest receivable to Pounds 14m.
In his statement, Lord Hanson said recovery was 'now evident in most of our
major markets' and that trading profit would improve in 1994. However, Mr
Bill Landuyt, finance director, said Hanson might suffer a Pounds 275m cut
in interest earnings because of acquisitions and the narrowing gap between
UK and US rates.
Hanson is one of the groups that had been thought likely to bid for parts of
a privatised British Coal. However, on the day the that the coal
privatisation bill was published, the company was understood to be no longer
interested in buying any part of the UK coal industry.

FT  03 DEC 93 / Volvo abandons Renault merger: Chairman quits as board bows
to shareholder pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo last night tore up its controversial plan to merge with France's
Renault, prompting the resignation of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar as chairman of
the Swedish industrial group.
An unprecedented revolt by senior management forced the Volvo board to bow
to shareholder pressure and to abandon the plan to create Europe's second
largest automotive group, in the course of one of the most dramatic days in
Swedish corporate history.
Mr Gyllenhammar, who has led Volvo since 1971 and has been one of Sweden's
leading industrialists, immediately announced his resignation, along with
four other board members. They included Mr Raymond Levy, Renault's former
chief and nominee on the Volvo board.
Mr Gyllenhammar bitterly denounced his critics for having 'turned their
backs on Europe and the world'.
He warned that Volvo's three-year-old alliance with Renault would be
destroyed and the long-term survival of Volvo jeopardised. 'The alliance
will not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management who,
understandably, has lost its confidence in Volvo . . . Volvo is right now a
wounded company.'
The board's decision followed a demand by Volvo's top management that the
merger be dropped. The revolt was co-ordinated over the past two days by Mr
Soren Gyll, the chief executive who was brought into Volvo last year by Mr
Gyllenhammar. Mr Gyll's decision in turn followed a wave of opposition to
the merger proposal from Volvo's Swedish institutional shareholders.
The board said it had become clear that it was 'very unlikely' the merger
would be approved at a shareholders' meeting. That meeting, scheduled for
next Tuesday, has now been cancelled.
Despite Mr Gyllenhammar's warning, Mr Gyll said he hoped Volvo would be able
to overcome Renault's disappointment and continue the alliance.
By the merger plan, Volvo would have placed all its core car and truck
operations into a joint company with Renault, in exchange for a 35 per cent
stake in the new company. Swedish shareholders, however, objected to what
they saw as a takeover on unclear terms by a state-owned company.
Their objections were not countered by assurances from the French side that
Renault would be privatised by the end of next year and that a planned
golden share would not be used to dilute Volvo's holding.
Investors, who had driven up Volvo's share price this week in anticipation
of the deal crashing, pushed it up further yesterday in New York following
the announcement. Within minutes the share price rose Dollars 3 to Dollars
55.50.
Mr Gyllenhammar, who strode into a press conference to announce his
resignation, dismissed arguments that Volvo's vehicle operations can prosper
on their own.
Mr Bo Rydin, a leading industrialist who heads the forestry group SCA, takes
over as acting Volvo chairman pending the election of a new board.
Renault said last night that privatisation could still go ahead. Industry
observers said the process would be complicated by merger's failure.

FT  03 DEC 93 / US and EU edge closer to trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US agriculture secretary Mike Espy (left), US trade negotiator Mickey Kantor
and EU external trade commissioner Sir Leon Brittan at a joint press
conference in Brussels where they said the US and EU were close to a deal on
market access for industrial products and on trade in food products.
But the absence of a definitive breakthrough because of last-minute snags is
still holding up overall progress in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations in
Geneva, involving 116 countries.
After 36 hours of intensive talks in Brussels between Sir Leon and Mr
Kantor, both sides said they hoped to reach an outline deal in a new
bargaining session on Monday.
The most significant progress appears to have been made in farm trade, an
issue that has dogged negotiations on the Uruguay Round since they it
launched in 1986

FT  03 DEC 93 / Pensions probe after fears over bad sales advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial regulators are to review the personal pensions of up to 500,000
individuals who have transferred savings out of employers' schemes into
private plans. Up to Pounds 7bn is involved.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's top watchdog, fears that
people may have been badly advised and might be worse off in retirement than
if they had stayed in their employers' schemes. An initial review by
regulators found that, in many cases, sales agents sought too little
information to be able to give proper advice.
Almost every life insurer, bank and building society that has sold personal
pensions is expected to be affected. The SIB has retained the accountancy
firm KPMG Peat Marwick to find out how many people are at risk. Its report
is to be released within the next few weeks.
The review is intended to see that those who followed wrong advice are
compensated and that measures are taken to ensure that, in future, personal
pensions are sold only to those for whom they are appropriate.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said personal pension policyholders 'should
not be alarmed. The problem we are looking at is not about theft.'
'The SIB felt that this was a problem that should be flagged and dealt with
promptly, so regulators are taking action now to ensure that people will not
be disadvantaged when they retire.'
The life insurance industry, under fire for its sales practices, has been
alerted to the regulators' actions and is concerned that the publicity will
further damage its reputation and business. It will also raise questions
about the government's strategy of offering tax incentives for people taking
personal pensions.
The SIB, along with the self-regulatory bodies for retail financial
services, Lautro, Fimbra and Imro, will form a panel of regulators and
industry officials. The panel will set a uniform standard for determining
when an individual is deemed to have been given wrong advice. Priority will
be given to cases of older individuals who have been encouraged to leave
schemes with fully inflation-indexed benefits.
The panel will also agree a method of assessing compensation. Regulators
feel compensation will prove most difficult to deliver where the employer's
scheme will not allow individuals to rejoin or where the life insurer cannot
or will not pay.
There are also concerns about whether insurers will be willing to pay
compensation on policies sold through independent financial advisers.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, will ask
member firms to review the cases of those who rejected an employers' scheme
in favour of a personal pension.
Lautro has taken disciplinary action against several life insurers whose
sales agents have aggressively encouraged transfers to personal pensions
from employers' schemes. Separately, the SIB has been stepping up
supervisory visits at the banks and building societies whose retail
financial services activities it directly regulates.
