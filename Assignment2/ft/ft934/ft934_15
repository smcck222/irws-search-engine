FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fenchurch postpones flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fenchurch Underwriting Agencies is to postpone the flotation of a new
Lloyd's investment trust, confirming earlier indications that the limit of
institutional investor interest in the insurance market's plans to introduce
corporate capital has been reached.
Fenchurch said the Minories Investment Trust would now be launched next
year. In the meantime its board, including independent non-executive
directors, would remain in position.
So far 16 investment and insurance companies have committed more than Pounds
850m to Lloyd's for the 1994 year, increasing capacity to underwrite
insurance by at least Pounds 2bn. However, because of a fall-off in investor
interest, one investment trust has been scrapped and several others have
scaled back their capital raising targets.
Fenchurch, which had planned to raise Pounds 35m, said its decision had been
taken in 'light of market conditions and the current lack of institutional
interest.'
Fenchurch stressed that its decision 'not to proceed was taken entirely on
the basis of the current lack of institutional appetite for these funds and
not because of a lack of quality capacity.'
The group's members' agency pooling arrangement or MAPA - a unit trust style
arrangement that allows Names to diversify their risks across a large number
of syndicates - was recently rated by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating
agency, as the best among those investment companies that were either listed
or planning a listing.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dyer made chief executive at BOC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases and drugs group, has appointed Mr Alexander 'Pat'
Dyer as chief executive.
Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said the board had discussed the concept of
splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive, believing it to be 'a
sensible move'. The group said such discussions had been going on since the
Cadbury report recommended against having one man filling both roles.
Mr Dyer, a 61-year-old American with some 30 years' experience in the
international gases industry, became BOC's managing director, gases, in 1989
and was appointed deputy chairman earlier this year. Before BOC, he was at
Air Products &amp; Chemicals. There he became executive vice-president
responsible for AP's worldwide gases and equipment business in 1987.
Mr Dyer is also currently non-executive chairman of Bunzl, the paper and
packaging group.

FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: QMH holders waive right
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of two Queens Moat Houses debenture issues worth a nominal Pounds
215m yesterday waived their right to enforce their security in a move that
helps clear the way for the proposed restructuring of the hotel group.
Under the debenture deeds, the security for the mainly institutionally-held
tradeable debt must be at least 150 per cent of the principal but a
valuation of QMH's assets by Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyors,
values the designated properties, mostly 27 UK hotels, at just Pounds 137.5m
 -a shortfall of Pounds 178.5m.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Ferruzzi investors approve share issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the debt-ridden Italian holding company, took
an important step towards its financial restructuring yesterday after
shareholders in Milan approved an ambitious recapitalisation.
The go-ahead for the scheme, prepared by a group of leading Italian bank
creditors led by Mediobanca, means Ferfin will launch a string of share
issues to raise cash.
As the deals are largely guaranteed by bank creditors, the main effect will
be to convert part of the debt into equity.
Shareholders approved the plan to raise L2,932bn (Pounds 1.1bn) through
rights issues and warrants to buy new shares. Moreover, the company also
received the green light to issue a further nominal L2,000bn in new shares
and L800bn in bonds over the next 18 months.
A similar plan is to be put to shareholders of Montedison, Ferfin's main
industrial subsidiary, today.
Ferfin's shareholders also approved a proposal by the board to take legal
action against Price Waterhouse, the group's former accountants. Ferfin's
new management, imposed by leading bank creditors earlier this year, says
the auditors failed to discover irregularities in the group's accounts which
allegedly arose under the previous management.
In spite of the recapitalisation, the Ferruzzi group faces another difficult
year, according to Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's chairman.
He told shareholders that the group's Montecatini chemicals subsidiary would
lose about L1,150bn in 1993. About L650bn of the loss would stem from
financing costs.
Mr Rossi said banks representing almost 87 per cent of Ferfin's borrowings
had agreed to the restructuring plan by Monday's deadline. However, a number
of big foreign banks remain opposed to the proposal and are working on a
counter scheme.
Mr Rossi said negotiations between Montecatini and Shell on an ambitious
joint venture to pool polyethelene activities were proceeding. The long
awaited deal, code-named 'Project Sophia', has been under discussion for
over a year. However, he gave no indication when a deal might be signed.
Banca Commerciale Italiana, the big Italian bank due to be privatised early
next year, said pre-tax profits in the first nine months of this year soared
to L585.3bn compared with L267.6bn in the same period in 1992.
Gross operating profits rose by 56.3 per cent to L1,363bn from L859bn. The
increase was due to a virtual doubling of fee-related income to L1,373bn
from L755bn.

<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity jolted the market with a 20 per cent dividend increase
to 6.6p, auguring well for the regional electricity company results season.
Eastern's share price gained 8p to close at 596p.
Rigorous cost cutting enabled the company to raise interim profits by 14.5
per cent to Pounds 77.4m despite sluggish economic activity in its area
which includes north-east London and East Anglia. Earnings per share rose
from 18.4p to 20.9p.
Mr James Smith, chairman pictured (left) with chief executive Mr John
Devaney, said the results demonstrated the company's determination to
increase efficiency.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Over-supply crumples newsprint: Turmoil sweeping the
industry worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of 26 North American newsprint makers recently donated 480 tons of
paper for a supplement on literacy and reading skills published by hundreds
of newspapers across the US and Canada.
The paper companies' generosity was laced with self-interest. Newsprint
suppliers are desperately seeking ways to counter the threat posed by the
growing number of North Americans - and increasingly Europeans - who rely on
television and video for news and entertainment.
The problem is that declining newspaper readership is just one facet of the
unprecedented turmoil sweeping the newsprint industry.
The newsprint market, which makes up about 13 per cent of total world paper
consumption, is entering its fifth year of over-supply. North American
prices, currently at about Dollars 430 (Pounds 290) a tonne, are still a
third below the peaks reached in spring 1988. Each attempt by producers to
raise prices over the past two years has proved short-lived. Some producers
will try again in March to impose a Dollars 35-per-tonne hike.
The glut has been caused partly by weak demand but also by a huge increase
in capacity in the late 1980s. More recently, Russian mills have begun
dumping newsprint in Europe.
Although consumption will rise as the main industrial economies revive,
there is a consensus that the industry's long-term future is not bright.
Salomon Brothers predicted in a recent report that prices would peak during
the next cycle, around 1997-98, at a level 20 per cent lower in real terms
than they were in 1988.
Salomon added that 'early in the next century, newsprint demand in developed
countries actually could decline as interactive multimedia technologies,
affecting classified advertising for example, become widespread'.
Daily newspapers account for more than 70 per cent of newsprint consumption
in North America. The upheaval is exacerbated by environmental pressures,
which have forced financially strapped companies to spend heavily on new
plant.
Many governments in industrialised countries require newspapers to maintain
a minimum content of recycled newsprint. But there are signs that demand for
recycled material may be near a ceiling. Mr Martin Glass, a partner at
Hawkins Wright, a UK consultancy, says mills are having difficulty
maintaining quality as fibres are recycled over and over again.
Furthermore, the sharp drop in Scandinavian currencies over the past two
years has improved the competitiveness of Finnish and Swedish newsprint made
from virgin fibres. The pressure to bring down costs in the face of fierce
competition is forcing far-reaching structural changes on the industry.
The market share of producers in Canada and Scandinavia, where trees grow
slowly and mills are far from the main markets, has fallen sharply, in
favour of modern lower-cost mills and recycled-paper facilities in such
places as the southern US, the UK and Germany.
Mr Bruce Kirk, analyst at SG Warburg in New York, counts a total of 21
newsprint and groundwood paper machines in Canada which have closed either
permanently or temporarily over the past four years. Another three are due
to be taken out of service next January. By contrast, three new machines are
about to come on stream in Germany. Svenska Cellulosa is adding a new
machine and rebuilding one at Aylesford in the UK.
Many forest-products companies are reassessing their newsprint interests.
Some - Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific for example - have withdrawn entirely
from the newsprint market.
Investment criteria are also being reviewed. One paper company executive
says a newsprint mill will have to pay for itself much more quickly in
future.
The most promising markets are those where a combination of rising living
standards, emerging democratic forces or a flourishing business sector will
lift demand for newspapers.
An official at Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest producer, singles out
eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. Canada's newsprint exports to Latin
America were 15 per cent higher in the first nine months of this year than
in the whole of 1992.
Mr Glass says that the best-placed companies will be those with local
production facilities, instead of trying to sell throughout the world from
their home base. Finnish-owned United Paper Mills has become a rising force
by building mills close to its customers in France and the UK. Similarly,
New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge has stitched together an empire stretching
from Canada, Brazil and Chile to Australia and New Zealand.
Some industry stalwarts are unlikely to survive in their present form.
Several companies are badly in need of capital; even less-weakened producers
cannot afford a big acquisition. Yet the case for consolidation is such that
the shake-up must be far from over.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Glaxo rejects restructure strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group, has rejected the paths followed by most
pharmaceuticals companies saying its strategy does not require restructuring
or rationalisation programmes, mergers, joint ventures or alliances with
generic drug producers, or vertical integration.
'Our competitive strengths - financial, scientific and commercial - lead us
to focus rather than dissipate our energies,' said Dr Richard Sykes, chief
executive.
Glaxo warned that growth over the next five years would be slower in the US
and Europe than the past five years. The group would concentrate on
maximising sales of established products, further penetrating global
markets, promoting innovative medicines and investing in developing regions.
Dr Franz Humer, chief operating officer, said it was necessary to take a
long-term view rather than instituting lay-off programmes. There had to be a
flexible approach tailored to individual markets. For example, the German
sales force had been cut this year after a 20 per cent collapse in sales
there, while in Spain, where sales were growing rapidly, the sales teams had
been expanded.
Sales in developing markets - Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East
and eastern Europe - were Pounds 511m last financial year and could triple
in the next five years, said Dr Humer.
The opportunities for Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, continued to
outweigh the threats, said Dr Sykes. The group would continue to expand the
overall market for peptic ulcer treatment, for instance by promoting the
drug for the treatment of ulcers caused by anti-arthritic drugs.
Imigran, the migraine treatment, had generated sales of Dollars 115m (Pounds
77m) in its first seven months to October, making it the group's most
successful launch, 20 per cent ahead of Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment,
over the same period.
Dr Sykes shrugged off data suggesting Zofran was not as effective as Kytril,
SmithKline Beecham's competitor. One resent study showed equal
effectiveness, and another showed Zofran was superior, he said. The drug
should be launched in Japan in the first half of next year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / ITN faces ownership shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current takeover battles in ITV will almost certainly lead to another
share restructuring at Independent Television News, the commercial
television news organisation.
Following the takeover earlier this year by a consortium led by Carlton
Communications, five companies each hold 18 per cent - Carlton, Central,
London Weekend, Granada and Reuters. Scottish Television and Anglia each
hold 5 per cent. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act no participant is allowed
to hold more than 20 per cent in the Channel 3 news supplier.
This week's conditional agreed bid by Carlton for Central means that the
enlarged Carlton would hold 36 per cent of ITN and would therefore have to
get rid of 16 per cent.
Mr David Gordon, chief executive of ITN, said yesterday that it looked as if
there would have to be orderly divestments if ITV takeovers were confirmed.
The ownership changes at ITN would become more sweeping if, as many expect,
Granada launches a takeover bid for LWT.
Last week Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, proposed that -
subject to parliamentary approval - one ITV company would be able to hold
two broadcasting licences, except in London.
Both Scottish and Anglia could also be takeover targets.
The ITN chief executive said yesterday that he saw 'absolutely no problem'
in finding new shareholders for what was now a profitable company.
Under broadcasting legislation, a majority stake in ITN is supposed to be
held by a non-ITV company by the end of next year.
Yesterday ITN also announced that it had been awarded a multi-million pound
three-year contract to supply news to NBC Super Channel, the pan-European
satellite channel. ITN will provide one and a half hours of programmes a day
to the channel.
Antonia Sharpe adds: Moody's, the international credit rating agency,
yesterday placed the long-term ratings of Carlton Communications under
review for possible downgrading following the bid for Central.
Moody's said its review would focus on the company's financial structure
upon completion of the acquisition, on the earnings and cash flow prospects
for the combined operations and on the potential for further acquisitions
from Carlton.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi link up for marketing deal

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Daimler-Benz and Japan's Mitsubishi, two of the world's largest
industrial groups, yesterday agreed to a package of measures aimed at
marketing each other's goods and increasing co-operation in recycling.
The agreements were unveiled last night in Berlin following 3 1/2 years of
discussions and several co-operation agreements.
Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, said: 'This kind of co-operation
between two huge industrial groups is still considered unique.'
Mr Shinroku Morohashi, the chairman of Mitsubishi, said that despite the
differences in management philosophy and corporate culture, relations
between the two companies 'would deepen'.
The projects are aimed at consolidating Daimler-Benz's strategy of gaining a
foothold in Japan and south-east Asia. They are also designed to strengthen
the competitiveness of Mitsubishi.
Projects range from environmental and recycling licence agreements and joint
ventures to distribution and marketing of Daimler-Benz products. They
include:
Metallurgical recycling process. A joint venture between Mercedes Benz and
Austrian Industries will take responsibility for technology transfer and
development, while Mitsubishi will market the process in Japan and
throughout the Asian market. The process replaces the conventional method of
shredding used cars.
Car industry. A subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz will assemble, distribute and
market the Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck in South Africa.
Electronics. Mitsubishi Electric will supply Temic Telefunken
microelectronic, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, with technology required for
the manufacture of semi-conductors for cars.
Plastics. Both companies will conduct a one-year feasibility study on the
recycling of waste plastics, with emphasis on cars, aircraft and electric
appliances.
A Daimler-Benz official said yesterday's agreements were expected to be
enhanced.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Net expenditure rises to Pounds 30.7bn for
1994-95 - National Health Service
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's net expenditure on the National Health Service will rise
from an original plan of Pounds 29bn for 1993-94 to Pounds 30.7bn in
1994-95, the government said in a statement.
In addition, the health service will have the benefit of new efficiency
gains worth at least Pounds 450m. Total spending, including receipts from
patient charges and land sales (gross spending) is expected to increase to
nearly Pounds 32.0bn in 1994-95.
The details of the increase in expenditure on individual programmes are as
follows:
Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS): in 1994-95 the government
will provide Pounds 21.2bn compared with Pounds 20.1bn in 1993-94, a cash
increase of 5.4 per cent, or 1.4 per cent after allowing for general
inflation.
The HCHS are also expected to increase efficiency by at least 2 1/4 per
cent, releasing at least Pounds 450m to be ploughed back into patient care.
Gross expenditure (including receipts from patient charges and income
generation) is estimated to be Pounds 21.5bn in 1994-95 compared with a
forecast of Pounds 20.5bn in 1993-94.
HCHS Capital Total: capital expenditure, including that financed by receipts
from land sales, will be over Pounds 2bn next year. Health authorities' and
MHS trusts' capital programmes include more than 150 building schemes, each
costing more than Pounds 1m. Government spending on capital will have
increased by 47 per cent in real terms between 1988-89 and 1994-95.
Family Health Services (FHS): government spending on the non-cash-limited
FHS will be more than Pounds 6.6bn in 1994-95, an increase of Pounds 561m
compared with original plans for 1993-94. This is a cash increase of 9.2 per
cent, or 5.0 per cent in real terms.
Total spending in 1994-95, including that financed from expected income from
prescription and dental charges, will be nearly Pounds 7.4bn.
Centrally Financed Services (CFS): expenditure on the CFS is expected to be
Pounds 751m in 1994-95.
These services include the special hospitals (Ashworth, Broadmoor and
Rampton Hospitals); the Public Health Laboratory Service; the Prescription
Pricing Authority and Dental Practice Board; information services; the
Health Education Authority; grants to voluntary bodies; secure
accommodation; research, and social services training.
Departmental Administration Costs: total expenditure on departmental
administration is expected to be Pounds 291m in 1994-95, a saving of 6.7 per
cent in real terms over this year's original plans.
Personal Social Services: on October 29, ministers announced an additional
Pounds 20m in 1994-95, Pounds 30m in 1995-96, and Pounds 448m in 1996-97 for
local authorities' new responsibilities for care in the community.
The additional funds in the first two years were made available in order to
help local social services authorities arrange for more home and respite
care.
This increase is quite separate from the NHS figures announced in this
statement. The Standard Spending figure for Personal Social Services (PSS)
revenue and all other local authority services will be announced later by
the environment secretary. Other decisions on PSS grants and capital will be
announced shortly.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Their Budget - The housewife
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pat Sanders, 52
Has grown-up sons, aged 31 and 26. She and her husband, Barry, a senior
executive for Rentokil, the household services group, recently moved from
Selby to Copthorne, West Sussex. Her views are coloured by the fact that her
children are setting up home.
Politics: last election voted Conservative.
Suggested: 'Why doesn't he impose a departure tax for tourists leaving the
country? It would raise millions and to people spending hundreds of pounds
on a holiday a pounds 10 tax would barely make a difference.'
Proved right: 'When I heard him announce the flights levy I was thrilled to
bits. I couldn't believe it. I think with the cost you pay for air fares,
pounds 5 or pounds 10 is negligible. I think it's a very subtle budget. It
affects everybody but not as badly as I think a lot of people expected. He
didn't really flesh a lot of it out.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Outlay on British Library to drop after 1996 -
Department of National Heritage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Planned spending by the Department of National Heritage will drop between
1995-96 and 1996-97 because of a projected reduction in spending on the
British Library's new building at St Pancras. In a statement the government
said spending for 1994-95 would be Pounds 976m, Pounds 998m in 1995-96,
dropping to Pounds 971m in 1996-97.
The Arts Council grant will increase plans by Pounds 800,000 in 1994-95, and
by Pounds 1.6m in 1995-96, giving a grant of Pounds 186.9m. This level of
grant will be maintained in 1996-97.
The Crafts Council grant will increase by Pounds 100,000 over current plans
each year, rising to Pounds 3.2m in 1994-95 and Pounds 3.3m in 1995-96 and
1996-97.
Annual expenditure on the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme (BSlS) will
rise over this year's figures by Pounds 300,000 in each of the next three
years.
Since 1984, Pounds 23.7m of government investment will, by the end of the
current financial year, have produced Pounds 48.3m in new sponsorship for
the arts.
The department directly finances 17 institutions including the Museums and
Galleries Commission. The department has made its allocations to individual
institutions so that over the planning period no individual institution
experiences a cut in its provision and some see substantial increases.
As a result, work can begin on a number of key areas - on the replacement of
the Natural History Museum's Spirit Building and of the Motive Power Depot
at the National Railway Museum in York, and on the redevelopment of the
south hall of the Horniman Museum.
In addition, in recognition of success in attracting money from the private
sector, the Tate Gallery will receive more than Pounds 2m over three years
to help with the relocation of their stores, and with the development of the
north-west quadrant at Millbank, the National Gallery will receive Pounds 1m
in 1996-97 towards the cost of redeveloping their North Extension, the
British Museum will receive Pounds 1m in the final year for the development
at Bloomsbury, and the Imperial War Museum will receive a total of Pounds
600,000 in the first two years for conservation.
Provision for the St Pancras project readjusts spending plans within total
planned expenditure of Pounds 450m. Provision has been made in the library's
grant-in-aid for 1996-97 to ease the financial pressure caused by the move
from Bloomsbury.
The grant for English Heritage for 1994-95 remains at the increased level
which was agreed last year. The settlement allows work to start on the
Albert Memorial in 1994-95. This is the result of an offer by English
Heritage to make available up to Pounds 1m next year fiom savings achieved
through their forward strategy. That strategy will permit further funds to
be transferred fiom overheads to direct spending on the heritage.
Over the three-year period a total of Pounds 15m will be available for fire
prevention measures in the Historic Royal Palaces, following up the
recommendations in Sir Alan Bailey's report.
The baseline for the Royal Household is restored to the levels planned
before the 1992 public expenditure survey. This will cover the government's
share of the cost of restoring Windsor Castle. It will also allow the Royal
Household to continue speedily with its Pounds 15m programme to implement
the Bailey recommendations on the occupied Royal Palaces.
Work on the joint venture project for a new Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds
is about to start. For 1994-95 Pounds 3m will be allocated rising to Pounds
6m in 1995-96 and 1996-97. The funds will be provided fiom the Historic
Royal Palaces Agency baseline.
An additional Pounds 2.5m over the next two years has been made available
for the tourist boards in recognition of tourism's importance to the
economy.
The budget for the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme for sport is to be
increased by 10 per cent from Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.3m. This recognises how
successful the Sportsmatch scheme has been in attracting private sector
sponsorship for grassroots sport during its first year of operation. The new
budget continues in 1995-96 and 1996-97 and should generate matching funding
from the private sector.
The Sports Council's grant-in-aid for 1994-95 will be slightly less in cash
terms than this year's allocation. However, the decision not to proceed with
the previously announced restructuring of sports administration gives the
council greater flexibility in allocating its resources and we would not
expect there to be any significant adverse effect on the work of the
council. Moreover, the paymaster-general announced on July 22 that a VAT
exemption for the supply of certain sporting services by non-profit making
organisations was under consideration. This should be of significant benefit
for voluntary sports organisations and further details will be available in
the New Year.
The grant to the British Film Institute, as already announced, shows a
substantial increase in 1994-95 when Pounds 2m more than in 1993-94 will be
provided. That figure continues in the following two years. This will focus
on enhancement of the rate of duplicating decaying nitrate film, some
re-equipment and an expansion of the off-air television recording programme.
The European Co-Production Fund was set up for a three-year period in 1991.
Over that period it received Pounds 5m. The government has announced that
the fund will be extended for a new three-year period and will receive a
total grant of Pounds 6m.
This will give the fund an opportunity to develop and build on its successes
in supporting co-productions between European partners.

<TEXT>
Legal aid, the main single component of expenditure by the Lord Chancellor's
Departments, is planned to increase from an estimated Pounds 1,254m this
year to Pounds 1,633m in 1996-97. This reflects demand-led increases in
workload, combined with measures to secure improved value for money by
better cost control.
The Lord Chancellor's target is to ensure that, by March 1996, average costs
per case do not increase by more than inflation.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Increase in prison places heads priorities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, announced that funding for Home Office
services next year would be nearly Pounds 6.3bn. The funding allows for:
Maintaining the current level of policing.
Extra prison places.
New measures to combat juvenile crime.
Mr Howard said: 'Alongside the very considerable public investment which we
are providing for over the next three years, we expect significant private
capital investment in prisons and other areas.
'Spending on the police service in England and Wales next year will increase
by more than 4 per cent over this year's provision. This will sustain
current levels of policing and provide for the organisational reforms
announced in the recent white paper as well as changes in pay, conditions
and rank structure announced in response to the Sheehy report.
'For the prison service, priority will be given to increasing the number of
prison places in order to accommodate the offenders we expect to be
sentenced to custody. Over 2,000 extra places will be provided by 1996-97
through building houseblocks at existing prisons.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Grant-maintained status seen to improve standards
 -Department of Education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The spending programme of the Department for Education and the Office for
Standards in Education (Ofsted) in 1994-95 will total Pounds 10,487m, Mr
John Patten, education secretary, said in a parliamentary reply, Pounds 670m
or 6.8 per cent higher than equivalent expenditure in 1993-94. The total in
1995-96 is planned to be Pounds 11,059m and in 1996-97 Pounds 11,392m.
Within these totals the government has given priority to improving standards
in schools through the self-governing (grant-maintained) schools programme.
The planned growth in further education student numbers announced last year,
to take the 16-19-year-old participation rate to record levels, will be
sustained.
On self-governing schools, he said that over 1,000 schools have voted 'yes'
to self-governing status in ballots. The government's expenditure plans
provide for continuing growth in the sector in line with the forecast in the
White Paper 'Choice and Diversity' that by 1996, most maintained secondary
schools, as well as a significant proportion of maintained primary schools,
would be self-governing.
Central government would increase its recurrent and capital grants
substantially over the next three years as their numbers grow. Central
government expenditure on self-governing schools is planned to total Pounds
157m in 1993-94 and Pounds 244m, Pounds 446m and Pounds 595m in 1994-95,
1995-96 and 1996-97. The plans also allow for the Funding Agency for
Schools, which will be established from l April 1994.
Total central government provision for capital expenditure on
self-governing, voluntary-aided and LEA-maintained schools is Pounds 600m,
Pounds 606m and Pounds 643m in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Further details
of Annual Capital Guidelines and allocations to voluntary-aided and
self-governing schools will be announced later.
Total recurrent spending on further education is planned to rise from Pounds
2,549m in 1993-94 to Pounds 2,679m, Pounds 2,872m and Pounds 2,920m in
1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97.
Mr Patten said the government was on target
to increase the number of students in further education by 25 per cent
between 1992-93 and 1995-96, taking the UK to the top of the international
league for participation in education among 16 to 19 year-olds.
He said the government must look to the sector for some increase in
efficiency. The plans announced allow for the forecast increase in student
numbers up to 1995-96 to be met in full, with an additional increase of 3
per cent between 1995-96 and 1996-97 to maintain the 16-18 year-old
participation rate.
Capital expenditure is planned to be Pounds 157m, Pounds 159m and Pounds
159m in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Mr Patten said this would enable the
Further Education Funding Council to continue to improve the state of
accommodation and the stock of equipment.
The number of students in higher education has grown even faster than
expected in the Government's spending plans last year, he said. The
proportion of young people entering higher education is now around 30 per
cent - close to the target of one in three for the year 2000.
In order to allow for the rising number of entrants enrolled in recent
years, the expenditure plans provide for total full-time equivalent student
numbers in higher education in England to rise by 90,000 or 10 per cent
between 1993-94 and 1996-97.
Mr Patten said the rapid growth in student numbers had imposed a large extra
burden on the taxpayer and the government believed a fairer distribution of
this burden was needed between the taxpayer and those who benefit from
higher education. It had therefore carried out a review of the funding of
higher education. The expenditure plans announced would reflect the outcome
of that review.
On tuition fees Mr Patten said the government would continue to reimburse
the fees charged to students up to the maxima specified through the
mandatory awards system. In order to stay within the expenditure plans, it
is essential that student numbers are now maintained at the planned level,
he said. To that end, the maximum tuition fees reimbursed through the
mandatory awards system in 1994/95 will be reduced by 45 per cent for each
fee band.
In addition, he has stressed to the Higher Education Funding Council for
England the importance of delivering through its funding methodology for
universities and colleges the planned numbers of students.
The reduction in tuition fees will have no effect on the planned level of
funding per student in higher education. Some Pounds 474m will be
transferred in 1994/95 from mandatory awards to Funding Council grant to
compensate for the lower yield from tuition fees. He said that if
universities and colleges recruit the numbers of students assumed in the
government's plans, they will suffer no loss of income as a result of the
reduction in fees.
Capital grant will be Pounds 322m, Pounds 381m and Pounds 424m in 1994-95,
1995-96 and 1996-97 respectively. This is a rise in real terms of 20 per
cent between 1993-94 and 1996-97. Mr Patten said the increase reflects the
need for capital investment to help with the growth of student numbers in
recent years and later in the decade.
On student support, Mr Patten said that for 1994-95, the government will
continue to maintain the real value of the funds offered to students through
the main rates of grant and loan and supplementary grants, which together
will increase by 4 per cent in cash. Reductions in the main rates of grant
of 10 per cent against their 1993-94 levels will be offset by increases in
loan entitlements. Similar adjustments will be made over the next two years;
on present estimates they will bring the grant and loan into broad balance
in 1996-97. This shift from grant to loan represents an acceleration of
existing plans.
The contribution of parents whose income rises at the same rate as average
income will continue to fall in real terms.
Loan rates for final year students will increase in proportion to the full
year rates of loan. As now, students will not have to begin to repay their
loans until they leave their courses and their incomes are higher than 85
per cent of national average earnings: nearly Pounds 14,000 in 1993 prices.
The government will keep the level of loan repayments under review.
Following a review of the Access Funds which help students who might
otherwise have difficulty in completing their courses, Funds have been
increased to Pounds 27m in each year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: European Commission urged to find proposals for
savings - Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government continues to believe that European Union expenditure on the
Common Agricultural Policy remains too high. The government will be urging
the European Commission to come forward with proposals for savings, in
addition to those on school milk and beef intervention which have already
been announced.
In a statement the government said its planned expenditure on the Common
Agricultural Policy is expected to rise to Pounds 2,640m in 1994/95, Pounds
2,880m in 1995/96 and Pounds 2,920m in 1996/97, increases of Pounds 130m,
Pounds 190m and Pounds 230m respectively.
Provision for spending on UK domestic agriculture has been set at Pounds
1,080m in 1994/95, Pounds 1,130m in 1995/96 and Pounds 1,120m in 1996/97,
decreases of Pounds 40m, Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m respectively (rounded
figures). This reduction takes place against a background of rising real
farm incomes and of firm control of public expenditure.
The provision for expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy reflects the
implementation of the reforms agreed last year. Under the agreement market
support prices for the main agricultural commodities will be progressively
reduced over three years and direct payments to farmers will increase. This
means that more of the cost of agricultural support will be borne by the EC
budget, but in overall terms this increase in budgetary costs will be more
than offset by a reduced burden on consumers.
Domestic Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: The decisions also need to be seen
against the background of very healthy movements in farm incomes. In 1992,
total income from farming, the main measure of farm incomes, rose by 11 per
cent in real terms. Figures for 1993 will be published at the end of
January. But already it is clear that there will be a further and larger
rise in 1993. These were assisted by the net 13 per cent devaluation of the
green pound since September last year, and the reduction in interest rates,
from 12 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent, over the same period.
Changes which have been made in the domestic agriculture programme provision
include the following:
Protection of the public: The provision for compensation for the slaughter
of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) suspect animals has been increased
by about Pounds 20m in 1994/95 in line with revised forecasts of the number
of cases expected and the average market price for cattle.
The amount allocated for flood defence and coast protection in England and
Wales in 1994-95, although Pounds 7m less than previously allocated, will
nevertheless allow for an increase of Pounds 13m in expenditure over the
current year's forecast. Provision stands at Pounds 289m over the next three
years.
Enhancement of the Rural Environment: During 1994, the Agricultural
Departments will, subject to the agreement of the European Commission,
introduce the new agri-environment schemes on which consultations took place
this spring. In Englad six new Environmentally Sensitive Areas will be
launched in March, with first agreements starting in September and first
payments made in April 1995, a rescheduling of five months.
During the course of 1994 the ministry will also introduce a new option in
all ESAs to encourage farmers to create new opportunities for public access,
as well as new Nitrate Sensitive Areas to protect drinking water sources, a
Moorland Scheme to improve the condition of heather ad shrubby moors, a
Habitat Scheme to create or improve a rage of wildlife habitats, an Organic
Scheme to encourage farmers to convert to organic production methods and a
Countryside Access Scheme to encourage farmers to create new opportunities
for public access on set-aside lad. The ministry's forecast expenditure on
payments to farmers in ESAs is set to rise from Pounds 20m this year to
Pounds 43m in 1996/97. Over the same period the provision for the other new
agri-environment schemes will rise from zero to Pounds 19m. For the UK as a
whole the annual provision for payments to farmers under these schemes will
rise to Pounds 91m in 1995/96 and to Pounds 94m in 1996/97.
Capital Grants: Grants will continue to be available under the farm and
Conservation Grant Scheme, at reduced rates, towards the cost of installing
or improving waste handling facilities, for activities such as the
provision, replacement or improvement of hedges ad traditional walls, and
for the repair or reinstatement of traditional farm buildings. Details of
the new rates, which are expected to yield savings of nearly Pounds 12m in
the UK in 1994/95, are contained in a separate news release issued today.
Present rates will be maintained for special assistance for works undertaken
as part of approved conservation plans in ESAs.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Aid budget to rise Pounds 83m - Help for
developing counties up 4%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's total external assistance programmes are to be maintained at their
previously agreed levels.
The aid budget, covering aid to developing countries and assistance to
central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, is set to rise by
Pounds 83m by 1996/97 - or 4 per cent in cash terms - compared with the
1993/94 provision.
Aid for the poorest countries in Africa and Asia and the provision of
know-how to central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union remain
particular priorities for ODA assistance. In all countries we pay close
attention to good government and the pursuit of economic reform.
Increased provision is made for global environment assistance, rising to
Pounds 24m by 1996/97, to provide for Britain's share of the replenishment
of the Global Environment Facility and of the Montreal Protocol funding
mechanism.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Increase in prison places given priority - Home
Office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Home Secretary Michael Howard announced that funding for Home Office
services next year will be nearly Pounds 6.3bn. The funding allows for:
maintaining the current level of policing
extra prison places;
new measures to combat juvenile crime.
Mr Howard said: 'Home Office planned expenditure fully reflects the
government's priorities of maintaining law and order and tackling crime.
Alongside the very considerable public investment which we are providing for
over the next three years, we expect significant private capital investment
in prisons and other areas.
'Spending on the police service in England and Wales next year will increase
by more than 4 per cent over this year's provision. This will sustain
current levels of policing and provide for the organisational reforms
announced in the recent White Paper as well as the changes in pay,
conditions and rank structure which I announced in response to the Sheehy
report.
'For the prison service, priority will be given to increasing the number of
prison places in order to accommodate the offenders we expect to be
sentenced to custody. Over 2,000 extra places will be provided by 1996-97
through building houseblocks at existing prisons.
'Alongside this direct public investment, we expect substantial private
capital investment in the prison service over the next three years. This
will go towards the six new prisons which will be financed, built and run by
the private sector.
'The government will also take steps to tackle juvenile crime. Just over
Pounds 100m of public expenditure will be provided over the next three years
for secure training centres and similar facilities for the hard core of
persistent juvenile offenders. In addition, we shall invite private capital
investment in the construction of the secure training centres.
'The government's commitment to victims remains strong. For example, we are
increasing the funding for victim support next year to over Pounds 10m, an
increase of nearly 15 per cent in real terms over this year's provision.
This would enable victim support to provide support to witnesses at every
crown court in England and Wales.
'I have reduced provision for Home Office running costs to reflect greater
efficiency. This includes a 10 per cent reduction per annum in the provision
for central administration.
'I have been able to maintain probation spending at broadly its present
level, but previous planned increases cannot now go ahead. This will require
increased efficiency in all aspects of community sentences, including the
closure of some bail and offender hostels which are not being adequately
used. But we still plan to provide about 100 additional places in areas
where this is justified to meet the requirements of the courts.
'Home Office spending will meet our key priorities, involve private as well
as public investment, and be consistent with the government's objective of
containing public expenditure.
Within the constraints of the current public spending round, with particular
emphasis on helping to reduce government borrowing to a level that the
country can afford, the government has continued to give high priority to
law and order.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Proposals override the statutory indexation -
Income tax allowances and assessments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rates of income tax, the personal allowance and the married couple's
allowance for those under 65, the basic rate limit above which higher rate
tax is paid and the income limit for age-related allowances will remain at
current levels for 1994-95.
The chancellor said that, from April 6, 1994, he would increase the blind
person's allowance by Pounds 120 to Pounds 1,200, and restrict relief for
the married couple's allowance, and the other allowances and reliefs linked
to it, to 15 per cent.
The married couple's allowance for those under 65 and related allowances
will be held at current levels, but the age-related married couple's
allowance will rise by Pounds 330, for 1995-96. The Treasury said: 'These
measures will have an overall yield of Pounds 550m in 1994-95 and Pounds
1.55bn in 1995-96.
'The chancellor's proposals will mean that the statutory indexation
provisions will be overridden. These provisions adjust the main allowances
and tax thresholds in line with the percentage increase in the retail prices
index unless Parliament decides otherwise.
'In the March Budget the former chancellor announced that relief on the
married couple's allowance would be restricted to 20 per cent for 1994-95.
At the same time, the age-related married couple's allowance for those aged
65 and over would be increased by Pounds 200, so that the extra tax paid by
the elderly as a result of this change would be no greater than for people
aged under 65 on similar incomes. The former chancellor announced that for
1994-95 the lower rate band would be increased by Pounds 500 to Pounds
3,000.
'The increase of Pounds 330 in the age-related married couple's allowance
for 1995-96 will ensure that the extra tax paid by the elderly as a result
of the further restriction of the allowance to 15 per cent is no greater
than for people aged under 65.
'The restriction of the married couple's allowance to give relief at 20 per
cent in 1994-95 and 15 per cent in 1995-96 will apply to the allowances and
reliefs which are set at the same level as the married couple's allowance
for those aged under 65, that is:
the additional personal allowance (mainly for single parents);
the widow's bereavement allowance (given to a widow in the year of her
husband's death and the following year); and
the relief for maintenance payments to a divorced or separated spouse.
'The increase in the blind person's allowance is the first for four years.
The allowance is given to people who are registered blind. In Scotland or
Northern Ireland, where there is no register, the equivalent requirement is
that a person must be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is
essential. There are about 30,000 claimants.
'People making maintenance payments currently qualify for tax relief at
their marginal rate on the amounts they pay, up to a limit of Pounds 1,720.
As announced in the March Budget, the relief on these payments is due to be
reduced to 20 per cent from April 6, 1994. From April 6, 1995 the rate of
relief will be further reduced to 15 per cent.
'People who entered into maintenance arrangements before March 15, 1988 may
currently qualify for relief at their marginal rate of tax on payments up to
the total amount on which they received relief in 1988-89. The relief they
receive on the first Pounds 1,720 of their payments will be restricted to 20
per cent for 1994-95 and to 15 per cent for 1995-96. Any payments between
Pounds 1,720 and the 1988-89 limit will continue to qualify for relief at
the payer's marginal rate.
'In general, the tax treatment of people receiving maintenance payments is
not affected by the proposed changes, regardless of when their arrangements
were made. 'Relief will be withdrawn on any maintenance payments made to or
for the benefit of children when they reach 21, in the minority of cases
where relief would currently continue beyond that age. The change will take
effect from the date of the child's 21st birthday where it occurs on or
after April 6, 1994.
'The yield in 1994-95 from holding allowances and the basic rate limit
unchanged will be about Pounds 550m (compared with an indexed base).
'The yield from the measures announced for 1995-96;
restricting the married couple's allowance for those aged under 65 and
related allowances to 15 per cent;
keeping these allowances at the same amount; and
increasing the age-related married couple's allowance by Pounds 330; will be
about Pounds 830m in 1995-96, rising to about Pounds 1,030m in a full year.
'The restriction of the value of the married couple's allowance and linked
allowances and reliefs will be implemented for employees by making a
reduction in their PAYE tax codes. The amount of the reduction will depend
on their marginal rate of tax and hence on an estimate of their income. If
in the event this estimate proves to be incorrect it will be put right at
the end of the tax year. Codes for 1994-95 taking account of these
restrictions will be issued early in 1994, when taxpayers will be given a
fuller explanation. For taxpayers not covered by PAYE, the restriction in
relief will be made in assessments or in calculating repayments.
'The chancellor proposes to restrict to 15 per cent the relief on mortgage
interest paid from 6 April 1995.
'The rate of tax relief on interest paid on certain loans used for the
purchase of life annuities by elderly people will not be affected by the
chancellor's proposal. Relief at the basic rate of tax will continue to be
available to people over 65 who take out loans to buy these life annuities.'
The chancellor announced proposals for reforms to the system for assessing
personal tax. The Inland Revenue said: 'The legislation proposed for the
1994 Finance Bill will:
replace the preceding year basis of income tax for the self-employed with
the simpler current year basis. The change will have immediate effect for
businesses starting after April 5, 1994, while existing businesses will move
to the new basis for the tax year 1997-98;
allow all those who complete tax returns for 1996-97 and later years to
calculate their own liability to income tax and capital gains tax, if they
wish;
introduce a uniform set of dates for the payment of income tax and capital
gains tax, starting from January 31, 1998.
The proposals will affect the 9m or so people expected to receive tax
returns in April 1997. Under the new proposals taxpayers who receive returns
will be invited to work out their own income tax and capital gains tax
liability from the tax year 1996-97 onwards. They will have to send their
tax return and tax calculation by January 31 following the end of the tax
year. Taxpayers can however ask the Inland Revenue to work out the amount of
tax due if they submit their returns by an earlier date (September 30).
The arrangements for collection of tax through PAYE and deduction at source
will remain broadly unchanged.
Where income tax above a certain amount has to be paid directly, two interim
payments will be due on January 31 in the year of assessment and July 31
following. The balance of any income tax together with any capital gains tax
will be due at the same time as the return is submitted on the following 31
January 31.
In the majority of cases payments and returns received by the Inland Revenue
will be accepted without question. The Revenue will then have broadly one
year in which to raise enquiries into those returns. The same rules will
apply broadly speaking to companies, to come into effect not earlier than
for accounting periods ending after March 31, 1996. For the self-employed,
tax will be charged by reference to the profits of the 12-month accounting
period ending in the tax year. This will in most cases allow a taxpayer to
self-assess tax liability by reference to one period of accounts only. But
the profits arising in the first tax year of a business will be assessed for
that year. The rules for the transition to the new system of taxing the
self-employed will allow the profits for the transitional year 1996-97 to be
assessed on the average of profits for that year and the previous one.
Businesses which start up after 5 April 5, 1994 will go straight on to the
new current-year basis.
Details of these rules will be contained in the 1994 Finance Bill.
Under the new arrangements each individual partner in a business will be
assessed on his or her share of the partnership profits.
The changes will affect new businesses starting after April 5, 1994 and the
computation of profits for existing businesses in accounting periods
starting normally in the tax year 1994-95.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposes to ensure that tax is charged on a benefit received
from a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (Furb) which has not
itself been taxed in the UK.
The chancellor intends is to stop such schemes, set up offshore, whose
income and capital gains are wholly or partly tax-free, providing employees
with a larger tax-free lump sum on retirement than would be provided by an
onshore fund whose income and gains are taxable.
The legislation would also apply where Furbs are marketed by insurance
companies, and takes effect for all benefits received under arrangements
made after today.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor put forward a number of changes to focus tax relief more
closely on schemes which encourage genuine PRP for a business' employees,
and to prevent its exploitation.
The chancellor proposes to make changes to two aspects of the tax relief for
PRP. Both will come into effect in relation to PRP schemes registered on or
after today.
The changes are:
To increase, in certain circumstances, the upper limit on profits which an
employer may disregard in calculating PRP; and also to ensure that that
limit is applied to a consistent measure of profits, taking one year with
another;
To ensure that PRP payable to employees in special schemes (PRP schemes for
particular units within a business) is not disproportionately greater than
PRP paid under other schemes to employees in the same business.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax relief is ended on extortion payments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Payments made as a result of extortion by terrorist groups or other
criminals will not be allowed to be offset against income for tax purposes,
the Inland Revenue said.
The intention was to discourage people from simply submitting to extortion,
and to make it clear that such payments will not be subsidised through the
tax system. The new provision will apply to payments made on or after today.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Inheritance tax threshold held at Pounds 150,000
 -Exchequer to reap extra Pounds 10m in 1994-95
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The inheritance tax threshold is to stay at Pounds 150,000 for 1994-95, the
Inland Revenue said yesterday.
The ceiling had been due to rise by an index-linked 1.8 per cent to Pounds
153,000. The extra yield to the Exchequer will be Pounds 10m in 1994-95,
Pounds 20m in 1995-96 and Pounds 25m in 1996-97 compared to indexation.
Since inheritance tax was introduced in 1986 the threshold has risen by more
than twice the increase in the retail prices index.
The number of estates paying inheritance tax on deaths in 1993-94 is
estimated at 19,000, less than 3 per cent of the total deaths in that year,
the Inland Revenue said.
'Leaving the threshold unchanged means that there will be about 21,000
tax-paying estates for deaths in 1994-95. The estimated yield for
inheritance tax in 1994-95 is Pounds 1.4bn.'
The annual exempt amount for capital gains tax is to be held at Pounds 5,800
for 1994-95.
An individual whose total net gains in a tax year do not exceed the annual
exempt amount is not liable to capital gains tax.
Husbands and wives are each entitled to their own separate exemption. The
total exempt amount available to a married couple will remain at Pounds
11,600 for 1994-95.
An exemption of Pounds 5,800 is also available to the trustees of a trust
for a mentally handicapped person or for a person receiving attendance
allowance or the middle or higher rate of disability living allowance.
For trustees of other settlements the exempt amount is Pounds 2,900. An
exemption of Pounds 5,800 is also available to personal representatives for
gains accruing to them in the year of death and the two following years of
assessment. The exemptions are automatically increased each year in line
with the retail prices index unless Parliament determines otherwise.
Statutory indexation will not apply for 1994-95.
The measures will increase the yield from capital gains tax by about Pounds
5m a year from 1995-96.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax to maintain neutrality of pay in kind -
Employers' loans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tax treatment of cheap and interest-free loans by employers is to
change, with the aim of 'maintaining broad neutrality between the tax
treatment of pay in cash and in kind,' the Inland Revenue said.
The revenue stressed it intended that most season ticket loans provided by
employers should continue to be exempt from tax, and gave details of an
exemption scheme for smaller loans.
It aimed to simplify legislation for taxing the benefit and to deal more
fairly with loans to employees of banks and other lenders.
The proposals, to take effect from April 6, are
to change the rules for taxing this benefit to give effect to the
restriction in mortgage interest relief;
to replace the exemption for small benefits from loans with a new exemption
for loans totalling up to Pounds 5,000;
to exempt loans which employers provide to employees on the same terms as
loans they make to the public;
set new rate of interest for some foreign currency loans.
The changes affect employees who currently pay tax on home loans provided by
their employers and others with similar loans who have not paid tax on them
(basic rate payers with home loans up to Pounds 30,000).
The restriction in mortgage interest relief means basic rate taxpayers with
a cheap or interest-free home loan of up to Pounds 30,000 provided by their
employer should in effect pay tax on the benefit of the loan at the
difference between the basic rate of tax (25 per cent) and the rate of
mortgage interest relief (20 per cent for 1994-95).
Higher rate taxpayers should pay at the difference between the higher rate
(40 per cent) and the rate of mortgage interest relief (20 per cent). The
revenue said existing legislation for taxing these loans could not easily be
changed to give these results.
The revenue said: 'The chancellor proposes to change the law so as to ensure
employees with cheap or interest-free loans get tax relief on their loans in
the same way as other borrowers.' There will be two distinct stages.
First, the value for tax purposes of the loan will be calculated. This will
be, as now, the difference between the interest (if any) paid by the
employee and the interest would have been paid on the loan at the official
rate of interest. This is a measure of the interest saved by the employee.
It will be added to other income and taxed at marginal rate of tax.
Second, the employee will get tax relief on the loan as if interest was paid
at the official rate. Within the ceiling of Pounds 30,000, the employee will
be entitled to mortgage interest relief on interest paid and on interest
saved.
The Inland Revenue will adjust PAYE codes in 1994-95.
The rules will apply in the same way for 1995-96 with the proposal to
restrict mortgage interest relief to 15 per cent.
To avoid costs for employers, employees and the Inland Revenue in dealing
with small loans, employer-provided loans are presently not taxed where the
benefit does not exceed Pounds 300.
The restriction of mortgage interest relief and the new rules for taxing
this benefit would have resulted in many employees losing this exemption for
small loans such as those to buy season tickets.
The chancellor proposes to introduce a new exemption for small loans where:
all the employee's cheap or interest-free loans total no more than Pounds
5,000, or
all the employee's cheap or interest-free loans, excluding loans which
qualify for tax relief, total no more than Pounds 5,000: eg, an employee
with a cheap mortgage and an interest-free Pounds 2,000 loan to buy a season
ticket will pay tax on the mortgage benefit but not on the season ticket
loan.
It is proposed to exempt loans made to employees on commercial terms by
employers who lend to the general public where:
the loans are made by an employer whose business includes the lending of
money;
loans are made to employees on the same terms and conditions as are
available to members of the public;
a substantial number of loans on those terms are made to public customers.
The exemption will take effect from 1994-95 and apply to existing and new
loans.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Retirement benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chancellor proposes to ensure that tax is charged on a benefit received
from a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (Furb) which has not
itself been taxed in the UK.
The Chancellor intends is to stop such schemes, set up offshore, whose
income and capital gains are wholly or partly tax-free, providing employees
with a larger tax-free lump sum on retirement than would be provided by an
onshore fund whose income and gains are taxable. The legislation would also
apply where Furbs are marketed by insurance companies.
When paid by the offshore Furbs, the lump sum will be taxed at the
employee's marginal rate. Tax will be charged on the difference between what
the employee receives and contributions made to the scheme by the employer
and employee.
The legislation will take effect for all benefits received under
arrangements made after today.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Stamp duty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to counter avoidance of stamp duty are included in the Budget. The
duty on sales will apply to exchanges of interest in land or buildings for
another, and transfers of land or buildings in return for other property
will be liable to stamp duty whatever the nature of the property offered in
payment. These provisions will apply to documents executed on or after
December 8, 1993, unless the document implements a contract made before
today.
Where the price payable on a sale or lease (or for the assignment of a
lease) cannot be determined at the time the document is executed, duty will
be payable on the open market value of the property transferred. This new
rule will apply to documents executed on or after December 8, 1993.
A similar rule will apply where the rent payable under a lease cannot be
determined. Where an agreement to surrender a lease otherwisethan by deed is
followed by an actual surrender, the agreement will be charged to duty as if
it were a deed surrendering the lease. This rule will apply to agreements
made on or after December 8, 1993.
The Chancellor's intention is to prevent the loss of revenue from devices
aimed at avoiding or reducing the duty which would normally be payable on
sales or other transactions.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Their Budget - The distributor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glyn Davies, 44.
Has one daughter grant-less at university and two younger sons at private
school.
Job: runs Russell-Davies, the East Anglia-based distribution company he set
up 20 years ago with his brother-in-law. The company has grown to 700 trucks
and 1200 employees.
Politics: votes Conservative.
Did not want: any increase in the price of DERV or road fund tax.
Verdict: 'I was quite pleased with the road tax issue, with nil on trucks.
However, we are concerned about the commitment to motorway tolls. That has
quite a serious impact on the costs of transport and distribution. The
increase of 3p a litre on diesel is going to increase the costs of our
vehicle operating costs by around 2 per cent. That will naturally affect our
profitability.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Export credit premiums cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the Budget speech, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
announced cuts in Export Credit Guarantee Department premiums - some of more
than 20 per cent - in a limited number of markets.
The markets are Argentina, India, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey, and
the reductions will apply until the end of 1994-95 unless there is a
significant deterioration in risk.
Mr Heseltine also announced that cover of Pounds 3.2bn will be available for
1996-97 for 'Amber Zone' markets, which include China, South Africa,
Indonesia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico. Oman,
Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey and Zimbabwe. Amber Zones are those
in which the risk is significant or ECGD's exposure is most concentrated.
The Pounds 3.2bn is a near-doubling of the annual allocation of Amber Zone
cover since 1991-92 and brings the total cover for the next 3 years to over
Pounds 9bn.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Law change to exchange gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposes to change the legislation on foreign exchange gains
and losses, introduced in the Finance Act 1993.
The changes will allow non-monetary assets to be matched with currency
contracts (rather than just borrowings in foreign currency) in determining
when exchange differences on the contracts are to be taken into account.
They will also extend the rules on currency contracts to cover contracts
which provide for net payments rather than an actual exchange of amounts of
principal, and enable oil companies which account for their oil and gas
related activities in different currencies to compute taxable trading
profits by reference to those currencies.
The changes will also ensure that, where assets acquired or disposed of by
transfer are accounted for under normal accountancy practice by reference to
the date of delivery rather than the contract date, this may be followed in
calculating exchange gains and losses.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Pension tax rules targeted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax rules for approved pension schemes are to change. One aim is to make
personal pension scheme annuities taxable on the same basis as pensions paid
by occupational pension schemes.
Another is to improve arrangements for monitoring tax affairs of
occupational pension schemes to ensure that the conditions on which tax
reliefs are given continue to be met. The government also wants to remove a
requirement for the Inland Revenue to approve the form of certain annuity
contracts before they can be marketed to occupational pension schemes by
insurance companies.
The Revenue said yesterday that the purpose of the changes was to improve
the operation of the tax regime for approved pension schemes.
At the moment, annuities paid by approved personal pension schemes are
treated as annual payments, so that basic-rate income tax is deducted from
each instalment. For some people on small incomes too much tax is deducted
and they have to reclaim the tax overpaid.
Mr Clarke intends to change the basis of the charge for those annuities from
Schedule D to Schedule E, bringing them within the PAYE system and allowing
the correct amount of tax to be deducted from each annuity payment.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Business rate rises will be halved in real terms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses facing higher rate bills as a result of the 1990 business rate
reforms will receive a lower increase than expected, under changes to the
transitional arrangements announced in the Budget.
Those facing the biggest rises will find their increases halved in real
terms, while many small shops with combined living accommodation will see no
real increase for the third year running.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said 360,000 rate bills in England
would benefit this year, following the Pounds 1.8bn of relief announced in
the past two Budgets.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Authorised unit trusts brought into line -
Treatment of companies' interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue is to review the rules for the taxation of interest paid
and received by companies. The review will also consider the rules on taxing
the return on securities.
Mr Clarke's objectives are to consider how far it is possible:
To simplify the tax system by removing unnecessary distinctions between
different ways of meeting the cost of borrowing and between loans from
different types of lender;
To allow the interest shown in the commercial accounts as a deduction for
tax purposes;
To remove the need to app-ortion the return on securities between capital
and revenue;
To rationalise the treatment of cross-border flows of interest to reflect
international developments;
To make it easier for businesses to comply with their taxation
responsibilities.
The chancellor is considering those issues now because reform of tax rules
for other costs of financing, foreign exchange gains and losses and payments
in connection with new financial instruments, will soon be complete.
The Revenue will be contacting interested representative bodies soon to
arrange informal discussions.
Authorised unit trusts: the chancellor proposes to change the tax rules for
authorised unit trusts. The rate of corporation tax they pay is to be
brought into line with the basic rate of income tax and there are to be new
rules for trusts that invest in assets which pay interest.
The chancellor intends to place investors receiving interest indirectly
through an authorised unit trust in the same tax position as if they
received that interest directly. That will remove a distortion in the
domestic savings market. At the same time it will remove a tax barrier to
the sale of authorised unit trusts to foreign investors. The changes will
take effect for distribution periods beginning on or after April 1 1994.
Authorised unit trusts are taxed as companies. The dividends they receive
from companies resident in the UK carry a tax credit and they pay
corporation tax on their other income at a special lower rate (currently
22.5 per cent). The trust is treated as distributing all of its income to
individual investors as dividends regardless of the nature of the income it
receives.
Investors receive their dividends from the trust accompanied by a tax
credit. UK individuals liable at the basic rate of income tax have no
further tax to pay on those dividends. So by investing for interest through
an authorised unit trust they pay tax at only 22.5 per cent (in the trust)
on interest, while if they received the interest directly, they would pay
tax at the basic rate.
Foreign investors, however, pay more tax if they invest for interest through
an authorised unit trust than they would if they invested directly in the
underlying assets of the trust. That is because foreign investors will
always pay some UK tax on dividends they receive from an authorised unit
trust. However, many foreign investors can receive interest free of UK tax
by investing in assets such as Eurobonds or by making a claim under the
interest article of the relevant UK double taxation agreement.
The chancellor's proposals include linked changes to tackle those issues:
The rate of corporation tax paid by authorised unit trusts will be realigned
with the basic rate of income tax;
Authorised unit trusts will be able to pay a new kind of distribution which
will be treated as interest for tax purposes. That interest payment may be
set against the trust's corporation tax liability on its interest income;
The trust will have to deduct income tax at the basic rate from interest
payments to investors who will receive credit for the tax deducted;
There will be special arr-angements to allow foreign investors to obtain
interest payments derived from certain (eligible) assets, such as Eurobonds,
of the trust free of UK tax;
Many foreign investors will be able to claim relief under the interest
article of the relevant UK tax treaty on interest payments derived from
other (ineligible) assets. Most UK individuals investing in auth-orised unit
trusts will be largely unaffected by the changes.
They invest in equity-based funds and will continue to receive their income
from the fund as dividends with an accompanying tax credit.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Crackdown ahead for asset transfers - Avoidance
schemes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A crackdown is planned on tax-avoidance schemes under which companies are
sold in such a way that their corporation-tax liabilities arising before the
date of sale cannot be collected.
The Inland Revenue said such schemes usually worked by transferring the
trading assets of a profitable subsidiary to another group company and
selling the subsidiary to a new owner. The new owner then strips it of the
remaining cash assets, thus leaving the company unable to pay outstanding
tax liability.
Proposed legislation would allow the Inland Revenue to collect the unpaid
corporation tax from the previous owners of the company, or from other
companies previously under the same ownership. The new provision will apply
to contracts for sale entered into on or after today. The revenue said Mr
Clarke's intention was to counter a 'substantial loss' of tax resulting from
such sales.
If certain conditions were met, the Inland Revenue would be able to collect
the unpaid tax from those who previously controlled the company, or from any
other company which was, at any time in the three years before the change in
ownership, controlled by that person or persons.
One of the conditions will be if the activities of a trade or business of
the company cease or the scale becomes small or negligible in the three
years before the change in the ownership. Another will be if corporation tax
liabilities arise in respect of accounting periods beginning before the
change of ownership, and part or all of those liabilities are not paid.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Finance from private sector is emphasised -
Infrastructure projects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The extension of London's Docklands Light Railway south of the Thames to
Lewisham is one of several infrastructure schemes which are to go ahead as
joint ventures between the public and private sectors.
This is a Pounds 100m project to extend the railway south from the Isle of
Dogs to Lewisham through a new tunnel beneath the Thames.
The extension will be designed, built, financed and maintained by the
private sector, and the new service will be operated by DLR.
Mr Clarke also announced several schemes which are to be financed wholly
from the private sector. These include modernisation of the west coast main
line of British Rail, which runs from London Euston to Glasgow through Crewe
and Carlisle. Detailed proposals will be announced today. The project will
cost up to Pounds 600m and will be taken forward to the project-definition
stage.
A Pounds 200m air traffic control centre for Scotland is to be established
as a wholly private-sector project, the Treasury continued.
The private sector will be invited to finance, design, build and maintain
the centre, and the project will be financially free-standing. The centre
will expand capacity for flights to and across Scotland and the north
Atlantic. The private sector will be invited to tender to finance, design,
build and maintain the centre, which will be used by the Civil Aviation
Authority.
Information for potential contractors for two of the six prisons to be built
using private finance will be issued shortly.
The Treasury said that the government's commitment to big infrastructure
projects was shown by the fact that work on building the Heathrow Express
rail link between London Paddington and Heathrow had begun, and that part of
a significant rationalisation of NHS Trust facilities at Aintree in
Liverpool was going out to tender as a privately-financed project. This
innovative scheme may serve as a model for similar projects.
The Aintree Hospitals NHS Trust is going out to tender on a scheme which
will involve the private sector in a wider project to rationalise the two
main acute sites.
Under the proposed scheme, it is envisaged that the private sector will
build and operate a 100-bed hotel, conference, catering and other facilities
on the Fazakerley Hospital site. The NHS trust would contract for a
proportion of the facilities offered, including beds in the low dependency
unit (patient hotel). The additional capacity would be sold by the private
sector operator to other customers.
The government also intends to take the necessary powers to allow the
involvement of the private sector in the provision of secure training
centres, the Treasury said.
It added that feasibility studies into how the second Forth road bridge
might be privately financed were nearing completion.
Following the issue of a pre-qualification document in September, several UK
and international companies have formally expressed interest in
participating in a competition if the government decides to proceed.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Valuation rules for tax purposes to be simplified
 -Oil and gas supplies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rules governing the valuation of oil and gas for tax purposes are to change.
The chancellor wants the rules to reflect commercial practice more closely,
while ensuring that income assessed for tax fully reflects the value of the
oil or gas produced.
The changes proposed are: a simpler rule for valuing gas disposed of on a
non-arm's length basis; a measure to facilitate the sale of landed North Sea
oil on special (CIF) terms; a reduction of 24 hours in the time allowed for
nominating crude oil sales for petroleum revenue tax (PRT); an improvement
to the rules allowing companies which do not trade in oil to be excluded
from the PRT nomination scheme; a more flexible approach to the valuation of
certain crude oil disposed of non-arm's-length. The changes apply primarily
to PRT. A corresponding value will also being taken into account, where
appropriate, for corporation tax and royalty purposes.
When UK-produced gas is disposed of other than in a sale at arm's length -
for example where it is sold by the producer to an associated marketing
company - the amount of income brought into charge for PRT and corporation
tax is the 'market value' of that gas. One of two statutory methods may
apply for determining market value. The gas is either valued on the same
monthly basis as applies for crude oil, or the producer may elect for a
valuation under a long-term pricing formula in accordance with detailed
rules in the existing legislation. The rules are becoming increasingly
difficult to apply satisfactorily to gas disposals.
A simpler rule is to apply for the valuation of light gases such as ethane
and methane. The new rule will follow normal arm's-length principles and
will enable the market value of gas to be determined on the basis of all the
relevant factors surrounding the particular disposal. Valuations will
continue to be made on a long-term basis where appropriate. The existing
system of elections will cease after 31 December 1993.
The PRT rules allow tax relief for the cost of transporting oil or gas only
as far as the nearest reasonable place of delivery in the UK or abroad.
Given these rules, arm's-length sales of landed North Sea crude by
PRT-liable producers to a more distant buyer, on terms which require the
seller to meet the delivery costs, are unlikely to take place since the full
sale price is taxed but the additional freight and other costs are
disallowed. From January 1 the PRT price of oil sold on such terms will be
the price at which the oil would have been sold at the nearest reasonable
place of delivery.
Mr Clarke proposed a new petroleum revenue tax (PRT) option for companies
with interests in North Sea oil or gas fields that have not yet recovered
their costs and that have a pipeline largely intended to transport
production from other fields.
Companies with such field interests will be able to elect that a proportion
of the pipeline expenditure be excluded from PRT relief and that in return
tariffs for transport and other services be received free from PRT if they
are paid by PRT-exempt new fields.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Petroleum revenue tax change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies transferring North Sea oil or gas field assets to an affiliate
will be charged petroleum revenue tax (PRT) on the disposal by reference to
the asset's market value, in all cases where the asset is used, or to be
used, to generate tariffs by providing services to other fields. This change
will apply to disposals made after yesterday.
The Inland Revenue said yesterday that the chancellor intended to prevent
significant potential PRT avoidance through the transfer of tariff-earning
assets between fields in the same ownership. 'It has recently become clear
that there are risks of significant future PRT loss through transfers of
tariff-generating assets such as pipelines between oil or gas fields in the
same group of companies,' the Revenue said.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Minor breaches of regulations to be
decriminalised - Excise traders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Minor breaches of excise laws, which can now be punished with fines of up to
Pounds 5,000, are to be decriminalised.
Breaches now classed as criminal include failure to comply with conditions
under which excise traders have excise approval and failure to pay duty.
These will be removed from criminal law, and fixed penalties, appealable to
the new VAT and Duties Tribunals, will be introduced in place of the fines.
The new civil penalties will be set at Pounds 250 for all offences, except
failure to pay duty due, where the penalty will be Pounds 250 or 5 per cent
of the duty, whichever is greater. It will be Pounds 20 for each day on
which there is a continuing failure, such as failure to maintain accounts
and records.
These changes will be part of a package to simplify and reform excise law.
They continue the de-regulation initiative and safeguard the interests of
traders.
Other proposed changes are:
Powers to estimate duty due from excise traders will be replaced with a new
power to assess. Excise officers will be required to exercise their best
judgment in making assessments, and there will be time constraints.
Assessments will be appealable to the new VAT and Duties Tribunals.
The Customs &amp; Excise Department will have an option to treat fraudulent
evasion of excise duties as a civil or criminal matter. When a civil evasion
penalty is imposed it will be equal to and payable on top of the arrears
due. But there will be powers to reduce or cancel the penalty if there are
mitigating circumstances.
At the moment, estimates of excise duty may be made at any time and there is
no right of appeal against them. Failure to pay on demand is a criminal
offence punishable with a fine of up to twice the estimated amount.
The VAT and Duties Tribunal will be able to set aside or reduce assessments
made by Customs &amp; Excise where the trader shows to their satisfaction that
either the officer had not used best judgment, or that a lesser amount was
due.
Changes to the repayment supplement system were also proposed; Mr Clarke
intends to complete the package of VAT reforms announced in the March
Budget. The changes are largely to the benefit of businesses, and reinforce
the principle that repayment supplement is an efficiency spur on Customs &amp;
Excise. Three changes are being made:
The length of time allowed for Customs &amp; Excise to investigate repayment
claims before triggering supplement is being reduced.
The minimum supplement which will be paid when a repayment claim has been
unduly delayed by Customs &amp; Excise is being increased from Pounds 30 to
Pounds 50.
Repayment claims which are received late will no longer be eligible for
supplement.
The revised system is expected to come into effect next year, one month
after the finance bill gains Royal Assent, and will apply to repayment
claims received after that date.
Repayment supplement becomes payable when Customs &amp; Excise unduly delay
repayment of a legitimate VAT claim return by more than 30 days from the
date of its receipt.
It is the counterpart of default surcharge, which is paid by traders who are
late in paying VAT due.
Customs &amp; Excise receive some 2.4m claims for VAT refunds amounting to more
than Pounds 24bn each year. More than 90 per cent of claims are authorised
for payment within 10 working days.
Access reform: Powers available to Customs officers for access to
information from businesses involved in the import and export of goods are
to be reformed.
The chancellor's intention is to align Customs powers with those already in
force for value added tax and excise.
The new powers will therefore already be familiar to most customs traders
and will allow them to benefit from an audit-based system of control.
Controls exercised at the frontier against smuggling are not affected by the
proposals.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Ensuring payments are fully accounted for -
Capital Gains on cash-settled futures and options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A rule change is planned for commodity and financial futures contracts and
for options which are settled in cash. The chancellor's intention is to
ensure that these payments are properly taken into account for the purposes
of capital gains tax.
The changes apply to futures contracts entered into, and options granted, on
or after today.
There are special capital gains tax rules (Section 143 Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992) which apply to commodity and financial futures
dealt in on a recognised futures exchange, or to which a Financial Services
Act 'authorised person' or 'listed institution' is a party. The rules
generally ensure that payments made or received under the contract are
properly taken into account for tax.
But where contracts involve an initial premium and the contract is settled
automatically in cash, the payer of the premium may not be able to offset
the full amount against the cash receipt. This is because the payer's rights
under the contract constitute a 'wasting asset' - where the CGT rules
provide for the allowable expenditure to be reduced over the asset's limited
life. The wasting asset rules do not apply to options, but the contracts in
question are not options because they are settled automatically with no
right of exercise. The chancellor proposes to change the rules to ensure
that payers will get relief in full.
Where an option is exercised, the capital-gains-tax rules provide that the
consequences of granting or acquiring the option are merged with those
resulting from its exercise. Thus, in the case of a straightforward share
option, the amount of the option premium the grantor receives will be taken
into account in calculating the overall gain or loss which he or she makes
when transferring the shares at the agreed exercise price.
Similarly, the holder will take into account, in calculating any gain or
loss on disposal, not only the amount directly paid for the shares but also
the option premium.
The exercise of certain options may however be settled in cash, and it is
not clear that such a payment qualifies as allowable expenditure.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Import and export information reform - Customs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposes to reform the powers available to Customs officers
for access to information from businesses involved in the import and export
of goods. The powers are intended to come into effect on Royal Assent to the
Finance Bill.
The chancellor's intention is to align Customs powers with those already in
force for value added tax and excise. The new powers will therefore already
be familiar to most customs traders and will allow them to benefit from an
audit-based system of control.
Controls exercised at the frontier against smuggling are not affected by the
proposals.
Until now, controls for Customs purposes have been directed at the goods
themselves, involving detailed frontier declarations and checking. In 1991
the Customs and Excise Department began to replace such transaction-checking
with an audit-based approach to control. This approach offers considerable
benefits to businesses: apart from relaxed frontier checks, businesses
receive fewer visits from Customs officers, and compliance costs are
reduced. However, new powers are required to give officers access to a
different range of information.
The proposals will allow the department to make regulations requiring
businesses involved in a Customs activity to keep records, and to produce
them for inspection within such time and in such form as may be reasonably
required. Such records may be copied or removed by officers. There are
safeguards to ensure that traders can continue to have access to the
documents or be provided with copies.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Treasury costs new measures at Pounds 411m in
1994-95 - Costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury said yesterday that the total cost of providing extra help to
pensioners over the next three years would be Pounds 411m in 1994-95, rising
to Pounds 897m in 1995-96 and to Pounds 1,287m in 1996-97.
Those figures include the extra costs of indexing benefits arising from the
directimpact of value-added tax on the pricelevel.
Retirement pension (including linked benefits) and pensioner income support:
Pounds 280m in 1994-95; Pounds 580m in 1995-96; Pounds 765m in 1996-97.
Income related benefits (except pensioners): Pounds 100m in 1994-95; Pounds
195m in 1995-96; Pounds 295m in 1996-97.
Other benefits: nil in 1994-95; Pounds 85m in 1995-96; Pounds 190m in
1996-97.
Cold weather payments: Pounds 1m in 1994-95; Pounds 2m in 1995-96; Pounds 2m
in 1996-97.
Total benefits: Pounds 381m in 1994-95; Pounds 862m in 1995-96; Pounds
1,252m in 1996-97.
Energy efficiency grants: Pounds 35m in 1994-95; Pounds 35m in 1995-96;
Pounds 35m in 1996-97.
Gas and electricity prices have fallen in both real and cash terms recently.
Compared with a year ago, gas prices are 3 3/4 per cent lower and, on
average, electricity prices are 1 3/4 per cent lower in cash.
The downward trend in average real fuel prices, pre-VAT, is expected to
continue as a result of the government's market-oriented policy towards
energy and the regulatory formulae now in place.
For a household using an average mix of gas, electricity, and other fuels,
prices have so far fallen 4 per cent in real terms since the start of this
parliament.
Over the life of the parliament they are are expected to fall another 3 per
cent, leaving them 7 per cent lower relative to other prices.
Since the last general election, real fuel prices have fallen and further
falls in the underlying price are expected over the course of this
parliament.
As a result of this, on average, pensioners and disabled people are likely
to find that the help they will receive will broadly cover all changes in
the price of fuel, including VAT.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Moves to compensate for VAT on heating - Help for
pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A package of help for pensioners, including the government's promised
compensation for the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, was a
significant part of the Budget speech.
But the chancellor drew his proposals wider, and included a proposal for a
pensioners' guaranteed income bond with regular payments of a guaranteed
fixed rate of interest, to compensate for the fact that many of those on
fixed incomes have seen their spending power fall as interest rates have
come down.
The other main features of the package were:
Extra help of Pounds 1.25bn a year by 1996-97 for 15m people;
A 50p-a-week increase in the rate for all single pensioners and 70p a week
for all pensioner couples from April 1994 in addition to their normal
uprating;
An intention to award the same weekly cash increases again in April 1995,
taking extra help overall to Pounds 1 for all single pensioners and Pounds
1.40 for all pensioner couples: by April 1996 total extra help will amount
to Pounds 1.30 for singles and Pounds 1.85 for couples (Pounds 1.40 and
Pounds 2.00 for poorer pensioners);
The same increases for those on widows and invalidity benefit.
The same increases for disabled people on income support.
Other groups on income related benefits to be paid the benefit increases
consequent upon VAT a year earlier than normal in April 1994, so that extra
money is available before the first VAT bill arrives. A similar approach
will be adopted in April 1995 for the second instalment of VAT and this
extra money will remain as a permanent addition to benefit levels.
Cold weather payments increased by 25 per cent from Pounds 6 a week to
Pounds 7 from next winter and Pounds 7.50 from the following winter.
All pensioners and disabled people to qualify for energy efficiency grants
at a cost of Pounds 35m a year, which represents a near-doubling of the home
energy efficiency scheme.
The government announced its intention to extend VAT to domestic fuel and
power in the March Budget at 8 per cent from April 1 1994, and at the
standard rate (currently 17 1/4 per cent) from April 1 1995.
The previous chancellor made it clear in the March Budget that the
government recognised that the measure would cause particular problems for
those on low incomes and this would be taken into account in the April 1994
benefit uprating.
The chancellor announced in his Budget speech detailed measures to help not
only households and pensioners on low incomes but also all pensioner
households, regardless of income.
From April 1994, some 15m people - including those on low incomes, all
pensioners, widows, and the long-term sick on invalidity benefit - will
receive extra help to meet the cost of VAT on their fuel bills.
Pensioners, including those receiving income support, will receive 50p a
week for a single pensioner on top of the normal uprating (70p where there
is a dependent husband or wife).
Where both members of a couple are receiving a full basic retirement pension
in their own right, they will each receive the 50p.
In April 1995, VAT on domestic fuel rises to the standard rate of 17.5 per
cent. In considering the April 1995 benefit rates the intention is, within
the exercise of the secretary of state's statutory responsibilities, to
increase the extra help overall to Pounds 1 for singles (Pounds 1.40 where
there is a dependent husband or wife).
Again, where both members of a couple receive the full basic retirement
pension in their own right, they will each receive the Pounds 1. These
increases will partly comprise indexation and partly further special
additions.
In April 1996, when the relevant indices 'catch up' with the effect of VAT,
the extra help given to pensioners in the earlier years will remain an
integral part of their benefit rates.
The retirement pension will be Pounds 1.30 a week higher for singles and
Pounds 1.85 a week higher for couples (Pounds 1.40 a week and Pounds 2 a
week for poorer pensioners).
For pensioners on income support, the increases will come on top of the
special increases of Pounds 2 a week for singles and Pounds 3 a week for
couples paid from October 1992 over and above normal upratings.
Pensioners are not the only group targeted for extra help. Widows, and
people receiving invalidity benefit, invalid care allowance, severe
disablement allowance, war pensions unemployability supplement and disabled
people on income support, will see similar increases to those for
pensioners.
For poorer households other than pensioners and disabled people, the extra
help will be provided by calculating the increases in benefit that would
result at the April 1995 uprating from VAT and paying these increases from
April 1994 instead.
This is a year ahead of the normal timetable and will ensure that the extra
help is available before the first VAT bill arrives. It will mean increases
in benefits in April 1994 of 3.9 per cent - a higher rate of increase than
many people in work are likely to receive.
People receiving other income-related benefits - family credit, disability
working allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit - will also see
increases in their benefits.
For April 1995 the intention is to adopt a similar approach. In April 1996,
this extra payment will remain as a permanent addition to benefit levels.
These increases in income-related benefits come on top of the extra sums for
community charge payments which were consolidated into benefit levels from
April 1993, even though recipients no longer have to pay local taxation.
These increases were worth an extra Pounds 1.60 for a single person and
Pounds 2.80 a week for a couple.
Cold weather payments will increase from the current weekly amount of Pounds
6 to Pounds 7 from next winter, and the intention is to make a further
increase the following winter to Pounds 7.50: a 25 per cent increase over
two years.
These payments are made automatically when there are sharp spells of cold
weather to those pensioner households, families with young children and
disabled people claiming income support.
An extra Pounds 35m a year will be made available for the next three years
to provide more grants for energy efficiency measures.
The Department of Environment's home energy efficiency scheme, which will
almost double in size, will be extended to all pensioners and disabled
people. Similar arrangements will be made in Northern Ireland, where there
is a separate scheme. At present, the scheme only covers households on
income-related benefits. They will continue to qualify for help, and since
the scheme was introduced in 1991 more than 500,000 such households have
received grants.
The extra Pounds 35m a year will provide grants for more than 200,000 extra
pensioner households a year, bringing the total number of households
receiving grants to almost 500,000 a year.
The pensioners' guaranteed income bond will combine a fixed rate of
interest, guaranteed for five years, with regular monthly interest payments.
This will enable pensioners to invest their savings in a secure asset and
know exactly how much they will receive in interest each month.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Relief for development projects - Business
support
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax reliefs for contributions to business development and training
organisations will continue, and there will be a new relief for business
contributions to Business Links - an initiative designed to provide a single
point of access for local business support agencies.
The latter relief will apply to contributions made on or after yesterday and
before April 1, 2000.
The existing tax relief for business contributions to Local Enterprise
Agencies (LEAs), Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and
Wales and Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) in Scotland, which is due to
expire on April 1 1995 will be extended to April 1 2000.
The chancellor's intention is to give an incentive for donations to Business
Links and at the same time bring the period for the existing reliefs for
contributions to LEAs, Tecs and Lecs into line with the new relief.
The Treasury said yesterday: 'The new tax relief will apply to contributions
by businesses (in cash or kind) to projects authorised by the Department of
Trade and Industry to use the service mark 'Business Links'.
The relief will be given by way of a deduction in calculating business
profits for tax purposes.'
Contributions by businesses to LEAs, Tecs and Lecs already qualify for
relief under Sections 79 and 79A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988.
This is due to expire on April 1 1995, but will be extended to apply to
contributions made before April 1 2000.
The cost of the proposals will depend on the number of donations made, but
is not expected to be large.
Business Links is designed to provide a single point of access for agencies
including Tecs, LecS, LEAs, chambers of commerce, and local authorities,
designed to offer a package of services targeted to meet the needs of local
business. A project will not be able to use the service mark 'Business
Links' without DTI approval.
The Budget also proposes to extend tax relief for vocational training to
National Vocational Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications at
level 5 and to exclude from tax relief children under 16, and 16- to
18-year-olds in full-time education at a school, and training undertaken
wholly or mainly for recreational purposes or as a leisure activity.
The intention is to broaden the tax relief so that it is available for
vocational training at all levels, and at the same time ensure that it is
given only for genuine vocational training.
The changes will take effect from January 1 1994.
The proposal will cost less than Pounds 1m in the first year, but might
increase to around Pounds 5m in a few years.
The yield from the restrictions to the relief will be negligible.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Threshold for registration set at Pounds 45,000 -
VAT changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs and Excise yesterday announced a package of measures it described as
a contribution to the government's deregulation policy and an aid to small
businesses.
In a statement, the excise said: 'The turnover threshold above which traders
are required to register for VAT will rise from Pounds 37,600 to Pounds
45,000 from midnight, allowing up to 75,000 businesses to opt out of VAT if
they wish.'
Insolvent businesses will be helped to survive by relaxing the rules on VAT
set-off, putting VAT debt on a similar footing to debt owed to other
creditors.
The minimum repayment supplement paid to traders when VAT refunds are unduly
delayed by Customs and Excise will rise from Pounds 30 to Pounds 50 and the
department will be allowed less time to investigate claims before becoming
liable to repayment supplement.
Businesses leasing cars to private taxi and self-drive hire firms and
driving schools will be able to reclaim the VAT on cars purchased.
This brings the VAT treatment of leased cars into line with that for cars
purchased outright for private taxi firms etc. This is a business
facilitation measure which is being introduced at the request of the leasing
trade.
The administrative arrangements for Gaming Machine Licence Duty will be
restructured. Operators will be able to choose licence periods which suit
their operational needs starting on a day of their choice rather than being
tied to annual, half yearly, or quarterly periods.
The law on excise will be modernised. The department's powers for making
duty assessments will be modified, minor offences will be decriminalised and
replaced by fixed civil penalties, and the department will have the option
to treat fraudulent evasion as a civil matter. The jurisdiction of VAT
tribunals will be extended to excise matters to hear traders' appeals
against duty assessments and civil penalties.
The jurisdiction of VAT tribunals will also be extended to provide a right
of appeal for traders on customs matters.
Compliance Cost Assessments are available for all the Customs deregulatory
measures. Copies from: Mr D Humphries, BACU 3, 10th Floor W, HM Customs and
Excise, 22 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PJ (Tel: 071 865 5781).

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Insurance tax set at 3%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Liability to pay and account for the new insurance premium tax of 3 per cent
will rest with the insurance company, which will be required to register
with, and make monthly returns to, Customs &amp; Excise, the Treasury said.
The new tax, which takes effect from October 1 1994, will apply to most
general insurance where the insured risk is located in the UK. It will not
apply to long-term insurance such as life insurance or pensions - much of
which, says the government, is essentially investment. Insurers not
established in the UK will be required to appoint a representative to
account for the tax on their behalf.
Policy-holders may be liable if they insure direct with non-UK insurers
which do not have a fiscal representative. Tax will be due on all monies
received by the insurance company (or a third party) in respect of the
insurance contract, but will not apply to brokers' commission.
Customs and Excise said it would discuss implementation and operation of the
tax with the insurance industry.
The tax is expected to yield Pounds 295m in 1994-95, Pounds 775m in 1995-96
and Pounds 840m in 1996-97.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Airport duty from October
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new excise duty is to be imposed on air travel from UK airports. From 1
October 1994, passengers will be charged Pounds 5 for flights to UK and
other European Union destinations and Pounds 10 elsewhere. The duty will be
collected from passengers by airlines.
Children under two who travel free will be exempt and so will passengers on
the return leg of a journey within the UK on a return ticket.
There will also be exemptions for transit and transfer passengers and for
passengers on small aircraft such as those used for Scottish inter-island
services. The duty will be collected from airlines on the basis of the
number of passengers carried. It is expected that airlines will add the duty
to their ticket prices.
The revenue yield is estimated to be around Pounds 115m in 1994-95 rising to
Pounds 330m in 1995-96 and Pounds 355m in 1996-97.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Move to close PAYE and NIC loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers will no longer be able to avoid accounting for PAYE by paying
their staff in assets such as gold bars and coffee beans, the chancellor
announced.
He said the secretary of state for social security is tabling similar
measures to counter avoidance of National Insurance contributions (NIC).
The intention is to prevent the use of artificial schemes designed to avoid
PAYE and NIC obligations. The change will yield Pounds 200m in 1994-95.
The new PAYE rules will come into effect following Royal assent to the
finance bill. The rules applying to National Insurance contributions came
into effect at midnight.
The most common schemes to get round the existing regulations involve paying
employees in gold or commodities, which the employee is then able to sell.
The proposal is to make employers account for PAYE when they pay their
staff: in marketable assets; or with assets which are not immediately
marketable, but where the employer arranges for the employee to convert them
into cash.
PAYE will also be applied to vouchers and credit tokens which are used to
provide such assets. Changes will also be made to ensure that vouchers and
credit tokens are valued for tax purposes according to the expense to the
person at whose cost they are provided.
The measures will also deal with other devices where the employer channels
payments to employees through a third party outside the UK, such as a trust,
in order to avoid his or her PAYE obligations.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: BES replacement extends to non-resident investors
 -Enterprise scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday unveiled details of its proposed Enterprise
Investment Scheme, to replace the Business Expansion Scheme.
The main features are relief at the lower rate of income tax (20 per cent)
on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, capital gains tax exemption
on the first disposal of shares on which relief has not been withdrawn and
relief against either income tax or capital gains tax for a loss on the
first disposal of shares on which the original relief has not been
withdrawn.
An investor can become a paid director and still qualify for relief if he or
she was not connected with the company or its trade at any time before the
eligible shares were issued.
There will be a limit of Pounds 1m on the amount a company can raise in a
year on which relief will be given.
The new scheme will incorporate a number of the features of the BES
Eligible shares in a qualifying company must be held for at least five years
Relief on up to half the amount an individual invests between April 6 and
October 5 in any year can be carried back to the previous tax year, subject
to a maximum of Pounds 15,000;
Qualifying investors are individuals who are not connected with the company
(employees and shareholders with more than 30 per cent of the shares) during
a specified period;
Qualifying companies are unquoted trading companies which carry on a
qualifying activity for a minimum of three years
A special limit of Pounds 5m a year on the amount which a company engaged in
certain shipping activities can raise in a year on which relief will be
given.
The new scheme will extend to companies trading in the UK whether or not
they are incorporated and resident in the UK and to investors liable to UK
income tax whether or not they are resident in the UK. The BES is available
only for companies that are incorporated and resident in the UK and for
investors resident in the UK.
A limit of Pounds 40,000 will apply for 1993-94 to an individual's combined
investment under the BES and the Enterprise Investment Scheme, with the new
limit of Pounds 100,000 applying from 1994-95.
The Exchequer cost of the Enterprise Investment Scheme will depend on the
take-up and the success of the investments made. Estimated costs are put at
Pounds 10m in 1994-95, Pounds 35m in 1995-96, and Pounds 50m in 1996-97.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Incentives for entrepreneurs are increased -
Investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government announced measures to encourage investment in unquoted
trading companies and increase availability of capital to such companies,
and to increase incentives for entrepreneurs who run their own businesses.
Among proposals are that any chargeable gain by an individual or most
trustees could be deferred where it was reinvested in shares in a qualifying
unquoted trading company.
The limits on gains qualifying for retirement relief are to be raised. Both
measures will apply to disposals on or after yesterday.
In a statement, the Inland Revenue said: 'A new capital gains tax relief for
entrepreneurs selling their own company and re-investing in an unquoted
trading company was introduced in the last Budget. This allowed
entrepreneurs to defer any chargeable gain on the sale of their company
provided various conditions were met.'
Under the chancellor's proposal, the re-investment relief is to be extended
to make it available for all chargeable gains realised by individuals. All
chargeable gains of trustees will also be eligible for the new relief except
where the beneficiaries of the trust are not individuals.
To qualify for re-investment relief, the chargeable gain arising on any
disposal must be re-invested in eligible shares in unquoted trading
companies or in the holding company of a trading group.
The re-investment must take place within a period beginning one year before
and ending three years after the disposal.
The main exclusions from the relief are re-investments in companies which
hold more than half of their chargeable assets as land, farming companies,
subsidiaries and certain financial concerns.
The existing relief for entrepreneurs also requires the entrepreneur to take
a 5 per cent stake in the company. This condition will not apply for the
extended relief and there will be no requirement on the investor to take a
minimum holding in the unquoted company.
Any deferred gain will be brought back into charge if the shareholder
emigrates within three years of the acquisition, or if the company ceases to
meet the qualifying conditions within three years of the investment being
made. Tax on the original gain will otherwise remain deferred while the new
shares are held. Relief will continue to be denied where shareholders are
guaranteed a return of their investment at the outset.
The extension of re-investment relief will cost between Pounds 5m and Pounds
10m a year from 1995-96.
Subject to certain qualifying conditions being met, relief from capital
gains tax is available when an individual disposes of business and certain
other assets on retirement. This relief is available to taxpayers who have
reached the age of 55, or who retire earlier due to ill- health.
The chancellor proposes to raise the limits applied to this relief so that
relief is available for the first Pounds 250,000 (previously Pounds 150,000)
of gains and half relief is available on gains between Pounds 250,000 and
Pounds 1,000,000 (previously between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 600,000).
The exemption is reduced if the individual has been running the business for
less than 10 years.
The limits apply separately to each individual who retires, so are
effectively doubled for a married couple if each satisfies the qualifying
conditions.
The change will cost some Pounds 10m.
In the Budget, the chancellor has also proposed:
To raise by Pounds 50,000 the limit on profits below which companies pay
corporation tax at the small companies rate of 25 per cent; the new limit
will be Pounds 300,000;
To raise by Pounds 250,000 the limit on profits above which companies pay
corporation tax at the main rate of 33 per cent; the new limit will be
Pounds 1,500,000.
The increases will apply for the financial year 1994.
The chancellor's intention is to allow more companies to benefit from the
small companies' relief and retain more of their profits for investment and
other purposes.
The main and small companies' rates of corporation for the financial year
1994 are not being changed from 1993.
The rate at which companies pay advance corporation tax (ACT) will, as
announced in the March Budget, be further reduced from 22.5 per cent to 20
per cent for dividends paid after 5 April 1994. This will give companies
which pay dividends a cash flow boost of some Pounds 1bn in 1994-5.
The proposed lower profits limit for the small companies' relief is Pounds
300,000: the proposed upper limit is Pounds 1.5m.
A company with profits below the lower limit pays corporation tax at the
small companies' rate (25 per cent).
A company with profits above the upper limit pays corporation tax at the
main rate (33 per cent).
A company with profits between the lower and upper limits pays corporation
tax at an average rate which rises from 25 per cent when its profits are at
the lower limit to 33 per cent when its profits reach the upper limit.
The increase applies for the financial year 1994 (the year beginning April 1
1994) and for subsequent years.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Chancellor encourages 'business angels' -
Measures will aim to boost investment and cut red tape burden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to help small business included a scheme to entice 'business
angels', measures to encourage prompt payment of business bills and lighter
audit requirements.
The Enterprise Investment Scheme will replace the Business Expansion Scheme,
which expires at the end of this year.
The scheme will give up-front tax relief at 20 per cent on investments in
the shares of unquoted trading companies, and income tax or capital gains
tax relief on losses. Capital gains will be tax-free.
Investors may put in up to Pounds 100,000 a year from 1994-95, and companies
may raise up to Pounds 1m a year under the scheme.
The Treasury said: 'By allowing investors to become paid directors, the
scheme will encourage 'business angels' who want to contribute their
expertise as well as their money.'
Unlike the old BES, investments in private rented housing will be excluded.
A new Venture Capital Trust scheme will give tax-free dividends and gains
for pooled investments in unquoted trading companies. A consultation paper
will be issued shortly.
Capital gains tax reliefs will be extended so that an individual can defer
tax on any gains reinvested in a qualifying unquoted trading company. Limits
for the CGT retirement relief are being raised to give full relief on the
first Pounds 250,000 of gains and 50 per cent relief on the next Pounds
750,000.
The package included a number of measures to help business finances:
Employers' national insurance contributions will be cut by 1 per cent for
employees earning less than Pounds 200 a week; and 0.2 per cent for others.
The Treasury said the savings for business would be greater than the cost of
the changes to statutory sick pay (SSP), announced yesterday. For companies
with a NIC bill below Pounds 20,000 a year SSP will be reimbursed in full
after the first four weeks of each claim.
'This means that the cost of employment will fall, particularly for smaller
firms, those which manage sickness absence well, and those with lower paid
employees,' the Treasury said.
The maximum real increase in business rates for businesses in transition to
higher rate bills will be halved. This will save businesses Pounds 105m in
1994-95.
The profit limit below which companies pay corporation tax at the small
companies' rate of 25 per cent will be raised by Pounds 50,000 to Pounds
300,000. The limit above which companies pay tax at the main rate of 33 per
cent rises to Pounds 1.5m. This will allow more companies to benefit from
the small companies' relief.
The Department of Trade and Industry published a consultative document on a
range of options for government action 'to help to foster a culture of
prompt payment'.
It said its main options were legislation for statutory interest on late
payment of debt and a new British Standard for prompt payment.
All government contracts will in future contain a clause committing the
client department to pay the contractor promptly, which will normally mean
within 30 days. Main contractors on government contracts are required to
treat their sub-contractors in the same way. They will no longer be able to
include 'pay when paid' clauses in agreements with sub-contractors.
The government also proposed a significant relaxation in the audit
requirements for small companies.
Company law currently requires all limited liability companies to have their
accounts audited. This requirement will be abolished for companies with a
turnover below Pounds 90,000 a year. Around 300,000 companies will benefit.
For companies with a turnover between this figure and Pounds 350,000 a year,
the audit will be replaced by a simple 'compilation report', certified by an
accountant, confirming that the company's statutory accounts have been
compiled from the company's records and are in accordance with the relevant
statutory requirements. A further 200,000 companies will benefit from this
change.
The VAT registration threshold will be raised immediately from Pounds 37,600
to Pounds 45,000. This will allow up to 75,000 traders to opt out of VAT.
The system for assessing personal tax will be simplified. This will help the
self-employed in particular. These changes, announced in the March Budget,
will be included in the Finance Bill.
The government is looking at ways of cutting the costs to business of
collecting national insurance contributions and income tax by aligning the
definitions of earnings and expenses used in the two systems. The government
is also considering a range of options for changing the way NICs are
collected.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Low inflation a key objective of medium term
strategy - Red Book details
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The overall objective of the government's economic policy is to promote
sustained economic growth and higher living standards. This section
describes the role macroeconomic policy plays over the medium term in
delivering that objective. It also sets out projections for the evolution of
the economy and the public finances, taking account of the government's new
spending plans and the Budget tax proposals.
Economic policy over medium term
Economic growth is generated by businesses and their employees, not by
governments. But governments do have the responsibility for ensuring that
markets work properly and that the regulatory and tax burden on business is
kept to an absolute minimum.
The government also has the essential task of establishing a macroeconomic
framework which provides the stability that businesses need to plan for the
future. Volatile inflation, unsustainable public finances and sharp
fluctuations in economic activity are all undesirable. As a major trading
economy the UK cannot hope to insulate itself from events abroad. But
domestic policies which keep inflation down and stabilise the public
finances create the right conditions for sustainable growth. Under the MTFS,
the government therefore directs monetary and fiscal policy towards two key
objectives: low inflation on a permanent basis and sound public finances.
Monetary policy
It is the role of monetary policy to deliver low inflation. The aim is to
keep underlying inflation (as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage
interest payments) in the range 1 to 4 per cent and to bring it down to the
lower half of this range by the end of the present parliament.
However, monetary policy influences inflation with a lag. Interest rate
decisions are therefore based on an assessment of the prospects for
underlying inflation in one to two years time. That assessment is based on a
range of monetary indicators and other data. The main monetary indicators
are those described in the 1993-94 MTFS, in particular the growth of narrow
and broad money and movements in the exchange rate and asset prices.
Estimates of the extent of spare capacity in the economy and the overall
stance of fiscal policy are also taken into account.
The medium-term monitoring ranges of 0 to 4 per cent for narrow money (M0)
and 3 to 9 per cent for broad money (M4) are unchanged from those set in the
1993-94 MTFS. However, M0's monitoring range will remain under review, as
there is still considerable uncertainty about the trend of M0 in relation to
GDP.
Funding policy will continue on the basis set out in the 1993-94 MTFS, with
sales of debt to banks and building societies from 1993-94 onwards counting
as funding in the same way as sales of debt to other sectors. It was
announced in March that sales of gilts to banks and building societies in
1992-93 - which were not at that stage counted as funding and totalled
Pounds 6.8bn - would be taken into account in implementing funding policy
over the following two to three years. Funding operations so far this year
have not made any use of this flexibility. But the government's intention is
that full account will be taken of it between now and the end of 1994-95, so
that gilt sales will be some Pounds 6.8bn lower than indicated by the normal
operation of the full fund policy. This will help to ease the exceptional
degree of cash shortage in the money markets, which has resulted in large
part from the gilt sales to banks and building societies in 1992-93.
The objective of the government's fiscal policy is to bring the PSBR back
towards balance over the medium term, and to ensure that when the economy is
on trend the public sector borrows no more than is required to finance its
net capital spending.
The public sector accounts now distinguish more clearly between current and
capital spending and provide estimates of net capital spending and the
public sector's current balance. In addition the government believes that a
steadily rising proportion of capital investment in the public services
should be financed by private capital, based on a proper transfer or sharing
of risk.
The direct effects of the tighter public expenditure ceilings and increases
in tax revenues announced in the Budget will build up over time and will
reduce the PSBR by some 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. But the pace at which
the PSBR declines will also depend significantly on the growth of the
economy over the medium term. On the basis of the main projections for
activity and inflation the PSBR is expected to return steadily towards
balance. By 1997-98 the current deficit is eliminated. By the end of the
five year period covered by the MTFS the PSBR is broadly in balance.
The main fiscal projections are based on the illustrative path of the
economy shown in the accompanying table. Output growth averages around 3 per
cent a year over the medium term, as the economy moves back toward trend.
These growth assumptions are similar to the average of the projections made
by the Panel of Independent Forecasters, and close to those in the March
1993 MTFS.
Spare capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflation over the
medium term and underlying inflation is projected to fall to the lower half
of the Government's 1 to 4 per cent target range by 1996-97.
Projections of the public finances consistent with these assumptions about
the economy are shown in the accompanying table. The PSBR is projected to
fall rapidly over the next few years, and by 1998-99 it is broadly in
balance.
The public sector's current account deficit falls rapidly and is projected
to have disappeared by 1997-98. Publicly financed capital spending is
projected to remain roughly constant over the period to 1996-97 covered by
the survey, and to grow in line with the control total thereafter.
Except where future changes have already been announced, the revenue
projections are based on the conventional assumption of constant tax and
national insurance rates from 1994-95, with allowances, thresholds and
specific duties indexed on the usual formulae. All proposed Budget changes
are taken into account.
The ratio of general government receipts (GGR) to GDP is projected to rise
as the economy recovers and the tax increases announced in March and in this
Budget are implemented. The cyclical downswing of the early 1990s reduced
the GGR ratio significantly. For example, the share of mainstream
corporation tax in GDP has halved over the past four years, largely because
of the recession-induced fall in taxable profits. But this should be
reversed in the upswing, albeit gradually given the lags in tax collection
and assessment.
The government's public expenditure total for 1997-98 and 1998-99 is assumed
to grow 1 per cent a year in real terms.
The ratio of general government expenditure (GGE), excluding privatisation
proceeds, to GDP was on a downward trend for much of the 1980s. In recent
years, the impact of the recession has caused it to rise. The new plans will
reduce the GGE ratio from 1994-95 onwards.
Public sector debt is currently rising rapidly as a per cent of GDP and this
is increasing the burden of debt interest payments. With the new public
spending plans and the tax measures announced, the net public sector debt
ratio peaks at around 44 per cent, below the levels of the first half of the
1980s, before starting to fall in 1997-98.
There are inevitably uncertainties about the medium term. Given present
spare capacity, growth could be stronger for a time without causing
inflationary pressures. On the other hand, a weaker than expected world
economy could hold back the pace of recovery.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Small business and investors seen to benefit -
Red Book details
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section summarises the tax and national insurance proposals in the
Budget. The measures will raise extra revenue building up over the next
three years to around  3/4 per cent of GDP, while minimising any damage to
incentives and to the long term performance of the economy. They include a
number of proposals to help business and in particular to encourage
investment in small and growing businesses.
The effect of the measures on government revenues is set out in the
accompanying table.
Inland Revenue
Income tax: There will be no change to the main income tax allowances or the
income limit for age-related allowances for 1994-95. The blind person's
allowance will be increased to Pounds 1,200.
The basic rate is unchanged at Pounds 23,700.
From 6 April 1995 tax relief for the married couple's allowance, and
allowances linked to it, will be restricted to 15 per cent. There will be no
change to the amount of the married couple's allowance for those aged under
65, and the allowances linked to it. The married couple's allowance for
those aged 65 and over will be increased by Pounds 330. Tax relief for the
first Pounds 1,720 of maintenance payments will also be restricted to 15 per
cent from 1995-96.
Tax relief for mortgage interest payments will be restricted to 15 per cent
with effect from 6 April 1995. Relief will remain at 25 per cent for those
aged 65 and over who take out a loan to buy a life annuity.
Sickness benefit and invalidity benefit will be replaced by a new benefit,
to be known as incapacity benefit, from 6 April 1995. The new benefit will
be liable to tax for new recipients from that date. The element which
replaces sickness benefit will not be taxed.
Tax relief for private medical insurance for those aged 60 and over will be
restricted to the basic rate with effect from 6 April 1994.
Tax relief for vocational training will be extended to National Vocational
Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications at level 5 from 1
January 1994. From the same date, tax relief will no longer be available to
children under 16; to 16 to 18 year olds at school full time; or for
training which is mainly for recreation or leisure.
Benefits in kind: The scales for assessing the benefit of fuel provided by
employers for private use in company cars will be increased by 6 per cent
from 6 April 1994. The scales are also used for employers' national
insurance contributions. The fuel scales for VAT will be similarly amended.
The tax treatment of cheap loans provided by employers will be revised from
6 April 1994. Employees will be taxed as if they had received cash instead
of a cheap or interest free loan, and will receive tax relief for the
interest they would have paid. Loans of up to Pounds 5,000 will be exempt.
There will be a new exemption for certain commercial loans and provision to
set an official rate of interest to measure the benefit of some loans in
currencies other than sterling.
Simplification and reform of tax: As announced in the March Budget, the
assessment and collection of personal tax will be simplified from 1996-97.
The main measures will abolish the preceding year basis of assessment for
income tax, and tax income as it arises from 1997-98, with a transitional
year in 1996-97; offer the option of self-assessment to all who complete tax
returns; align payment dates for assessed income tax from all sources and
for capital gains tax; introduce separate assessment for partners; and
introduce clear rules for filing tax returns and paying tax, and penalties
for failing to comply with them.
Other measures are:
the existing requirements to provide information about offshore trusts will
be clarified;
the procedure by which lenders are admitted to the MIRAS scheme will be
simplified, with effect from Royal Assent;
the capital gains tax rules for payments under certain financial and
commodity options and futures contracts will be amended for contracts
entered into from 30 November 1993 ;
improvements will be made to the operation of the tax regime for approved
pension schemes;
amendments will be made to the rules for approved profit sharing schemes to
equalise the tax treatment of men and women in schemes approved before 25
July 1991 and to improve the treatment of qualifying corporate bonds;
stamp duty legislation will be amended to clarify the meaning of execution
(with effect from 8 December 1993); and to relax the penalties on the late
stamping of agreements for lease (with effect from 6 May 1994).
Limits and exempt amounts: The capital gains tax annual exempt amount will
remain at Pounds 5,800 for individuals and Pounds 2,900 for most trusts.
The threshold for inheritance tax will remain at Pounds 150,000.
The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made with
tax relief (the earnings cap) will be increased in line with inflation to
Pounds 76,800.
Investment in small businesses: A new Enterprise Investment Scheme will be
introduced from 1 January 1994 to encourage equity investment by individuals
in unquoted trading companies. The scheme will provide relief on investments
at a rate of 20 per cent, and income or capital gains tax relief on losses.
Capital gains will be tax free. It will not be available for investments in
private rented housing. Investors previously unconnected with the company
will be able to become paid directors. The maximum amount that can be
invested in any one tax year will be Pounds 100,000. (For 1993-94 the limit
will be Pounds 40,000 for total investments in the Business Expansion Scheme
and in the new scheme). The maximum amount a company can raise under the
scheme in any 12 month period will be Pounds 1m.
A consultative document will be issued on a scheme for Venture Capital
Trusts to encourage investment in unquoted trading companies.
Liability to capital gains tax arising on the disposal of assets on or after
30 November 1993 by individuals and most trustees will be deferred when the
gains are reinvested in unquoted shares of qualifying trading companies.
The limits for capital gains tax retirement relief are to be increased. For
qualifying disposals made on or after 30 November 1993 full relief will be
available on the first Pounds 250,000 of gains, and 50 per cent relief on
the next Pounds 750,000.
Lifetime gifts of business and agricultural property sold by a donee qualify
for relief under inheritance tax where they are replaced by similar assets
within one year.
This period will be extended to three years, for deaths on or after 30
November 1993.
Business taxation: Following consultation announced in the March Budget, a
foreign income dividend (FID) scheme will be introduced to help companies
with surplus advance corporation tax (ACT) arising from dividends paid out
of foreign profits.
From 1 July 1994 a company may opt to classify a dividend as a FID. ACT will
be payable in the usual way, but where the dividend is paid out of foreign
profits, surplus ACT may be reclaimed. Unlike an ordinary dividend, a FID
will not carry a tax credit, but will be treated as having borne tax at the
lower rate. There will be special rules for international headquarters
companies.
The profits limits for the small companies' rate of corporation tax will be
increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 1.5m from 1 April
1994.
Two changes are proposed to help businesses faced with insolvency.
From 30 November 1993 a creditor will not be denied tax relief for trade
debts given up as part of a voluntary arrangement under the 1986 Insolvency
Act, solely because the creditor could have recovered more of the debt by
putting the debtor into liquidation or bankruptcy. For the debtor, the
amount given up will no longer be liable to tax. The rules for reducing VAT
repayments from Customs to take account of tax due to them will be relaxed,
from shortly after Royal Assent. This will have the effect of putting VAT
debts on a similar footing to debts owed to other creditors.
Tax relief for business donations to Training and Enterprise Councils and
similar bodies, which was due to expire on 1 April 1995, will be extended to
1 April 2000. In addition, tax relief will be available for business
donations to Business Links made from 30 November 1993 to 1 April 2000.
All payments made on or after 30 November 1993 as a result of extortion by
terrorist groups or other criminals will be disallowed for tax purposes.
Improvements will be made to the new rules for foreign exchange gains and
losses announced in the March Budget. The new rules will come into force on
a date to be announced.
The tax treatment of financial instruments used by companies for managing
interest rate and currency risk will be reformed so that all the profits and
losses on these instruments will be taxed or relieved as income as they
accrue. The reforms will be implemented from the same date as the new rules
on foreign exchange gains and losses.
The Inland Revenue will review the rules for the taxation of interest paid
and received by companies. The review will also consider taxation of the
return to investors in securities.
Other minor changes are:
tax provisions will be made for British Rail and Northern Ireland Airports,
in line with earlier privatisations;
the capital allowances provisions for connected persons will be amended to
include transfers of enterprise zone commercial buildings and qualifying
hotels prior to 16 March 1993. The March Budget made similar provisions for
such transfers on or after that date.
Oil taxation: The technical rules governing the price of oil or gas charged
to petroleum revenue tax (PRT) and, where appropriate, corporation tax and
royalty, will be modified with effect from 1 January 1994 to take account of
changes in the markets.
In certain circumstances companies will be able to elect that a proportion
of expenditure on assets, such as pipelines, providing services to other
fields will be ineligible for PRT relief, and that tariffs received from new
fields exempt from PRT will be outside the PRT charge (*).
Anti-avoidance and revenue protection measures: Employers who pay their
employees in marketable assets such as gold bars will be obliged to account
for income tax under PAYE when the payment is made. Such payments are
currently treated as benefits in kind on which employees pay income tax
after the end of the tax year. Parallel measures will be applied to national
insurance contributions.
Changes will be made to the rules for profit related pay schemes. These will
affect the upper limit on the profits which an employer may disregard in
calculating profit related pay, and the requirements which have to be met if
a special scheme (a scheme for a particular unit within a business) is to
qualify for tax relief.
For disposals of assets on or after 30 November 1993, capital gains
indexation allowance will only be able to extinguish a gain, and will not be
able to create or augment a loss.
Where a company fails to meet corporation tax liabilities which arise prior
to its sale to another company, the Inland Revenue will be able to collect
the unpaid tax from the previous owners of the company or from other
companies in the same group. This will apply to contracts entered into on or
after 30 November 1993.
In order to pursue an acceptable distribution policy non-trading foreign
companies controlled by UK companies will have to distribute at least 90 per
cent of their taxable profits less capital gains and foreign taxes, for
accounting periods ending on or after 30 November 1993.
Changes will be made, with effect from 8 December 1993, to counter avoidance
of stamp duty on exchanges of interests in land; on property transferred for
a price which is not ascertainable at the time the document is executed; and
on agreements to surrender a lease (other than by a deed).
Provisions will be introduced, with retrospective effect, to ensure that tax
continues to be collected under PAYE from certain groups of foreign
employees coming to work in the UK.
New capital allowance rules will be introduced to limit the extent to which
taxpayers can backdate claims for assets reclassified as plant; and to
prevent buildings and structures being reclassified as plant in future.
The rules for taxing payments made in lieu of dividends or interest will be
clarified with effect from 30 November 1993. The scope of the rules will
also be extended, with effect from a date to be announced, to cover
compensation for dividends or interest which takes the form of a price
adjustment rather than a payment.
Measures will be taken to deter avoidance of petroleum revenue tax through
transfers of pipelines or other tariff-earning assets between fields.
Companies which are resident in the UK, but which would be regarded as
resident in another country for the purposes of a double taxation agreement,
will be treated as not resident in the UK for all tax purposes from 30
November 1993.
Non-residents carrying on business in the UK will not be able to claim
relief for losses incurred as a result of the exemption of royalty income
under a double taxation convention. The restriction will apply to accounting
periods beginning on or after 30 November 1993.
A benefit received from a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme will
be taxed if the scheme itself has not been subject to UK tax.
Customs and Excise
Value added tax: The turnover threshold above which traders are required to
register for VAT will rise from Pounds 37,600 to Pounds 45,000, and the
deregistration threshold will rise from Pounds 36,000 to Pounds 43,000, from
1 December 1993.
The minimum supplement paid to traders when VAT refunds are unduly delayed
by Customs will rise from Pounds 30 to Pounds 50, from one month after Royal
Assent. Customs will be allowed less time to investigate repayment claims
before becoming liable to pay the supplement.
Businesses leasing cars to private taxi and self-drive hire firms and to
driving schools will be able to recover the VAT they pay on cars bought for
this purpose from 1 January 1994.
Excise duties: The duties on tobacco and fuel will be increased from 6pm on
30 November 1993. Duty on wines and cider will rise and duty on fortified
wines will be reduced on 1 January 1994. Duty on beer and spirits will
remain unchanged. The change in duty and its effect on the price of each
product is set out below:
The duty on road fuels will be raised on average by at least 5 per cent in
real terms in future Budgets, an increase from the 3 per cent commitment
given in the March Budget. Developments in charging for road use will be
taken into account in determining the appropriate level of duty.
Duty on tobacco will be increased on average by at least 3 per cent in real
terms in future Budgets, as a contribution towards meeting the targets for
reductions in smoking in the Health of the Nation White Paper.
There are a number of measures to modernise tax law and reduce burdens on
business:
the administration of gaming machine licence duty will be restructured. This
will apply from 1 March 1994 for traders operating only over the summer
season, and from 1 May 1994 for others;
powers relating to customs offences will be modernised and brought into line
with those for VAT and excise. This will allow an audit based system of
control;
criminal penalties for many of the less serious excise offences are to be
replaced by a system of fixed penalties;
the jurisdiction of VAT tribunals will be extended to cover traders' appeals
against decisions on excise and customs matters, by 1 January 1995.
Insurance premium tax: A new tax will be introduced at a rate of 3 per cent
on insurance premiums for most general risks in the UK, from 1 October 1994.
It will not apply to life insurance, pensions and other defined classes of
long term insurance; insurance of certain ships and aircraft, international
railway rolling stock, and goods in international transit; export credit
insurance, or reinsurance.
Air passenger duty: A new duty will be payable by passengers travelling by
air from UK airports from 1 October 1994. It will be charged at Pounds 5 per
passenger for destinations in the UK or the EC, and Pounds 10 for
destinations elsewhere. There will be exemptions for the return leg of
journeys within the UK on a return ticket, children under two who travel
free, transit and transfer passengers, and passengers in small aircraft.
Vehicle excise duty: Duty on cars, light goods vehicles, vans and taxis will
rise from Pounds 125 to Pounds 130 from 1 December 1993. New rates will be
set for combined transport lorries, to come into force in 1994. Rates of
duty for other lorries are unchanged.
Business rates
England and Wales: Poundages will be increased in line with the increase in
the RPI in the year to September 1993.
The maximum real increase in bills faced by properties in England and Wales
which are in transition to higher bills as a result of the 1990 reforms will
be reduced by half. This means that real increases will be limited to 10 per
cent for large properties and 7 1/2 per cent for small properties. Rates
bills for small properties in transition which are used for both business
and domestic purposes will be frozen in real terms. This change will reduce
the total rates bill in England and Wales by 0.8 per cent.
Scotland and Northern Ireland: Scotland and Northern Ireland have different
arrangements for business rates but their total rates bill for 1994-95 will
also be reduced by 0.8 per cent.
National insurance
The main rate of employers' national insurance contributions will be reduced
by 0.2 per cent, and the lower rates by 1 per cent, from April 1994.
From April 1994 the lower earnings limit will be increased from Pounds 56 to
Pounds 57 a week, in line with the single person's rate of retirement
pension; the earnings thresholds for the employers' lower rate bands will
each be increased by Pounds 5 to Pounds 100, Pounds 145 and Pounds 200; and
the upper earnings limit will be increased from Pounds 420 to Pounds 430 a
week.
Treasury grant not exceeding 16 per cent of contributory benefit expenditure
will be made available to the National Insurance Fund in 1994-95.
The Government Actuary will report on the likely effect of these changes on
the National Insurance Fund.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Fundamental reviews of expenditure are under way
 -Red Book details
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government announced in February that it would conduct in-depth reviews
of all public spending by every department of state. This work, expected to
take much of the period of this parliament to complete, goes well beyond
traditional survey arrangements. It examines long term trends in spending on
individual programmes to assess whether these are sustainable. It seeks out
areas from which the state might withdraw altogether or where better
targeting is appropriate.
This work is focused on the medium term; but the early results of the first
four reviews (into social security, health, education and the Home Office)
have helped inform the decisions taken during this Survey affecting those
four departments.
The next batch of reviews will cover employment and transport programmes,
the legal departments, Trade and Industry, Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise, HM Treasury and urban expenditure.

Former Lloyd's underwriter: has resigned as a Lloyd's name but is still
liable for losses in one syndicate which is hit by US asbestosis and
pollution claims. He has a stop-loss policy which meets his liabilities at
present, but the policy will expire in several years' time. 'This
overshadows our whole financial life. Our day-to-day living is pretty
comfortable, in a modes way, but I can't plan for anything.'
Politics: last election voted Labour 'out of intellectual convictions,
rather than practical.'
Said yesterday: Gave the chancellor eight marks out of 10. 'Budgets tend to
be damp squibs, but on this occasion it was a lot more interesting and a lot
better than I expected.'
He calculate the measures would reduce his overall income by pounds 6 a
week.
Was 'very pleased' there had been no general increase in VAT and thought it
sensible to continue to reduce tax relief on mortgage interest payments.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tighter rein to be put on public spending - Red
Book details
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's objective is to reduce public spending as a share of
national income over time. The public spending plans set out in this Budget
are consistent with that. In each of the three survey years, the new plans
are well below the figures set out in the last Financial Statement and
Budget Report (FSBR). Control of public spending will therefore contribute
significantly more to reducing the public sector borrowing requirement than
expected at the time of the last Budget.
The government's plans for public spending are set in terms of the new
control total (NCT). This covers 85 per cent of total spending, but excludes
the two areas of expenditure most affected by the cycle. A full description
of the NCT and its components was given in the 1992 Autumn Statement.
The control totals for the three survey years 1994-95 to 1996-97 have been
set at Pounds 251.3bn, Pounds 263bn, and Pounds 272.3bn. These are Pounds
3.6bn, Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2.9bn below the figures in the last FSBR. The
control totals include reserves of Pounds 3 1/2 bn in 1994-95, Pounds 7bn in
1995-96 and Pounds 10 1/2 bn in 1996-97.
In real terms (ie deflated by the GDP deflator) these figures imply a fall
of 1 1/4 per cent in the NCT in 1994-95 and rises of 1 per cent in 1995-96
and 1996-97. Average real growth over the three year period is less than
1/4 per cent a year, well below the 1 1/2 per cent ceiling established by
the government last year.
The effect is to lower the path of real NCT growth for the second successive
survey.
The control total for the current year, 1993-94, is currently forecast at
Pounds 244.7bn. This is an underspend of Pounds 0.4bn compared with the
plans set in last year's Autumn Statement, after taking account of
classification changes. Higher social security spending within the control
total and higher net contributions to the European Communities together
account for most of the reserve of Pounds 4bn. Some Pounds 1.7bn of the
claim on the reserve reflects higher support for local authorities, mainly
in respect of rent rebates and allowances and mandatory student awards.
The government's ultimate public spending objective is expressed in terms of
general government expenditure (GGE) excluding privatisation proceeds. This
is a wider aggregate than the NCT and includes debt interest, elements of
social security spending which are significantly affected by the cycle and
various accounting adjustments needed for consistency with the national
accounts. GGE is now expected to grow by just under 1 per cent a year on
average over the three survey years, substantially below the expected growth
of the economy. As with the NCT, the rate of growth is sharply down on the
projected path in the last FSBR, and represents a marked slowdown on the
growth seen over recent years.
In 1993-94, GGE (excluding privatisation proceeds) is estimated to be around
Pounds 1bn lower than forecast in the March FSBR, due mainly to lower
spending on cyclical social security. GGE (excluding privatisation proceeds)
is expected to be some Pounds 3 3/4 bn lower in 1994-95 as a result of the
Budget. Over the three survey years, the Budget reduces GGE by a total of
Pounds 10bn. Public expenditure restraint therefore contributes about the
same as revenue increases to the reduction in the PSBR over the next three
years. In 1994-95, spending contributes about twice as much as revenue.
In recent years, the impact of recession has contributed to a rise in the
GGE/GDP ratio, both because of increased cyclically-related spending, such
as unemployment benefits, and because of the fall in GDP between 1990 and
1992. The ratio is now thought likely to have peaked at around 45 per cent
in 1993-94. With restraint in public spending and the economic recovery
gathering pace, the ratio is projected to fall to 43 3/4 per cent in
1994-95, and to 42 1/2 per cent in 1996-97. This represents considerably
faster progress on the Government's public spending objective than expected
in the 1992 Autumn Statement or the March FSBR.
As announced by the Chancellor on 14 September 1993, central government
departments will be expected next year to cover pay and running costs
increases from efficiency savings of at least 2 per cent and other
economies. Increases for higher workload in areas such as the prison service
and tax compliance are offset by reductions elsewhere.
Provision for the running costs of central government departments in the
period 1994-95 to 1996-97 is frozen at broadly the 1993-94 level of Pounds
20.1bn. Compared with previous plans, provision has been cut by around
Pounds 400m in 1994-95 and Pounds 600m in 1995-96.
Provision for pay throughout the rest of the public sector has been set on a
comparable basis. The general government paybill is not therefore expected
to change much next year, except where major workload changes are projected.
Total public sector capital spending in 1993-94 is expected to total Pounds
23.8bn, up from Pounds 23.2bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 21.5bn in 1991-92.
In 1994-95 public sector capital spending, which is measured net of receipts
from asset sales, is expected to be Pounds 22 1/4 bn. The fall compared with
this year mainly reflects the profile of capital spending by local
authorities. This follows the decision announced in the last Autumn
Statement to relax for a limited period the rules governing the use of
receipts by local authorities. Spending financed by this measure will
continue for a number of years, but at a steeply diminishing rate. In
addition, investment associated with a number of large-scale projects,
particularly in relation to the Channel Tunnel, has now passed its peak of
activity.
The level of public sector capital spending beyond 1994-95 is particularly
uncertain. After allowing for a stylised allocation from the reserve, based
on historic expenditure shares, it is expected to be at about the same level
in 1996-97 as in 1994-95. There is a temporary dip in 1995-96, reflecting
the expected sale of married quarters by the Ministry of Defence.
Public sector capital spending was maintained at high levels during the
recession. As the recovery continues, capital spending by the private sector
is likely to rise and that in the public sector to fall. The overriding need
for public spending to contribute towards the reduction in public borrowing
means that capital spending will not be sustained at levels as high as in
1993-94. Even so, tight control of public sector pay and civil service
running costs has enabled the Government to sustain capital spending at a
level higher than would otherwise have been possible.
The figures above take no account of the investment programmes of the former
nationalised industries, which amounted to over Pounds 10bn in 1992-93, nor
of the large amount of private sector investment stimulated by government
policies, including housing and urban programmes. Over the medium term, the
government intends that an increasing proportion of the capital invested in
public services will be delivered through private finance.
The aim of the private finance initiative is to involve the private sector
in new investment and service provision in areas traditionally regarded as
the responsibility of the public sector. This will produce projects which
are better designed and better managed. The initiative is based on two
fundamental principles: to receive rewards the private sector must genuinely
assume risk, and value for money must be demonstrated for any expenditure by
the public sector.
Spending by the public sector, by way of a contribution to a privately
financed project or a payment for services, counts against a department's
spending allocation or its external financing limit in the case of a
nationalised industry. But the private sector's contribution is additional
to public provision. This means that, for a given amount of public
expenditure, new and better quality capital investment will be secured by
the nation.
In March the government announced that the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and
Heathrow Express would proceed as joint ventures between the public and
private sectors and that the government would examine how the private sector
could become fully involved in Crossrail and the second Forth road bridge.
Work on building the Heathrow Express began in October 1993; the secretary
of state for Scotland's feasibility studies into how the proposed second
Forth road bridge might be privately financed are nearing completion; and
the secretary of state for transport has recently announced the basis on
which the Channel Tunnel Rail Link will be transferred to the private
sector, with the competitive process starting in early 1994.
In addition, the home secretary has said that he will invite the private
sector to put forward proposals for custodial service packages involving the
finance, design, construction and operation of six new prisons. A briefing
pack for those interested in tendering for the first two prisons will be
issued in December 1993.
The government is committed to expanding further the scope of private
finance. The initiative offers, for example, major opportunities for
improved services in the NHS, and the prospect of improved water and
sewerage infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
In this Budget, the chancellor has announced that the refurbishment of the
West Coast main line will be privately financed; that the Lewisham extension
of the Docklands Light Railway will proceed as a joint venture; and that a
new air traffic control centre for Scotland will be developed as a
financially free-standing private sector project. The chancellor also
announced that the government intends to introduce contracts under which the
private sector will design, build, finance and operate roads. Electronic
motorway charging will be introduced when the technology is ready. In
addition, a scheme now going to tender for the rationalisation of NHS trust
facilities at Aintree in Liverpool may serve as a model for similar schemes;
and the private sector is to provide nursing home accommodation for NHS
patients in Eastbourne.
The chancellor has recently established a joint public/private sector
working group, with Sir Alastair Morton as chairman, to stimulate the flow
of private finance projects. The group is intended to identify new areas of
activity where the private sector can get involved and find solutions to any
obstacles which may impede progress.
The new plans reflect a careful consideration of priorities. Additional
resources are being made available for health, education and science and
technology, while the Home Office law and order budget is being maintained
at the level previously planned. Those additions have been achieved despite
demand-led pressures, in particular on social security spending, running to
several billion pounds.
To ensure that the remit was achieved and priority programmes were
protected, a dual strategy was adopted during the survey. First, drawing on
the programme of fundamental expenditure reviews, the government looked to
reductions within the demand-led programmes themselves. This approach has
been largely successful: the proposals on social security in particular will
deliver substantial savings later in the decade. But, given the lead-times
involved in reform, the demand-led programmes on their own could not deliver
the totals required. The second part of the government's strategy was
therefore to seek savings from efficiency improvements and in lower priority
areas. Public sector pay and running costs were identified as key candidates
for reductions: the greater the restraint on paybills the more the resources
available for service provision and capital spending. This approach has
enabled priority areas of spending to be protected even in departments where
total budgets have been reduced.
The accompanying table analyses the control total by department showing
changes from previous plans. Central government support for local
authorities and the financing requirements of nationalised industries have
been attributed to appropriate departments.
The following paragraphs briefly describe the new plans for each department.
The departmental reports published in the first half of March 1994 will give
more details.
Planned spending on defence in 1994-95 and 1995-96 will be Pounds 23.5bn and
Pounds 22.7bn respectively, Pounds 260m and Pounds 520m lower than
previously published figures. Defence spending in 1996-97 will be Pounds
22.8bn, broadly the same in cash terms as the new 1995-96 plan.
These plans will be delivered in part by lower procurement and employment
costs than previously assumed, and by the planned sale to a private sector
housing trust of married quarters for service personnel. The government also
intends to place greater emphasis on the efficiency with which our forces
are supported. The defence secretary has set in hand a major study to
identify those aspects of the support given to the front line where costs
can be reduced without affecting the government's commitments in the UK and
overseas.
The additions to previous plans are Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m in 1994-95 and
1995-96 respectively. They reflect the importance attached to diplomatic
activity and take account of various pressures on the diplomatic budget,
including increased international subscriptions and relative overseas price
movements.
Planned provision for overseas aid will rise by Pounds 30m in 1994-95 and
Pounds 50m in 1995-96. The higher level is maintained in 1996-97.
The UK aid programme is one of the largest in the world and widely
recognised as providing high quality aid. It will continue to focus on the
poorest countries, generating sustainable economic growth and social
development, the promotion of good government and the direct reduction of
poverty.
Spending on agriculture in the UK is to a large extent determined by the
European Community's common agricultural policy (CAP). Expenditure on CAP
agriculture market support in the UK increases substantially, largely due to
the depreciation of sterling since autumn 1992, which results in an increase
in the value of CAP payments and prices in sterling terms. This increase is
partly offset by expected savings due to policy changes.
Against a background of higher farm incomes, support for domestic
agriculture has been reduced. Capital grant rates will be significantly
reduced and the designation of some new environmentally sensitive areas will
be deferred. There are also reductions in research and development spending.
Hill livestock compensatory allowances will be lower, following the autumn
review of economic conditions in the hills and uplands.
The department has refocused its efforts to match industry's needs more
closely. The provision of advice to exporters has been reorganised to
include up to 100 secondees from the private sector. The full range of DTI's
functions has been reviewed to see whether improvements in the delivery of
services can be made by transferring functions to the private sector.
Provision is made for the external financing limits (EFLs) of Nuclear
Electric, the Post Office, British Coal and British Shipbuilders. Nuclear
Electric's EFLs are substantially lower due to its increased efficiency and
reflect the reclassification of payments from the fossil fuel levy as
external finance. The figures for the Post Office, which take account of the
proposed sale of Parcelforce, show an increase in its cash surplus. The
figures for British Coal, which for planning purposes assume privatisation
at the end of 1994-95, show a decrease in the need for external finance
compared with 1993-94.
ECGD provides credit insurance facilities for UK exporters. It supports the
provision by banks of export finance at fixed rates of interest. The new
plans largely reflect changes in the estimated cost of interest support.
The department will continue to finance a wide range of training measures
for young people and the unemployed and other help with work preparation and
job search. These are delivered mainly by Training and Enterprise Councils
and the Employment Service. The new plans provide for spending of Pounds
3.8bn in 1994-95, an increase of Pounds 30m on the previous year after
excluding the transfer of provision for the Careers Service to the
department from 1994-95. The Scottish and Welsh Offices have separate
provision for the main training and enterprise programmes.
The plans allow for the introduction of a new apprenticeship initiative, an
extension of present Employment Service measures and additional
opportunities on the Community Action programme over the next two years. The
new apprenticeship initiative will enable over 40,000 young people a year in
England to achieve national vocational qualifications at level 3 (equivalent
to A level).
The government retains a substantial road building programme. Total spending
on trunk roads and motorways in England will average nearly Pounds 2bn a
year throughout the survey period, although it will be reduced from previous
plans by Pounds 140m in 1994-95 and Pounds 100m in 1995-96. The roads
programme is still benefiting from low construction prices and the baseline
for 1994-95 is worth more in volume terms than when it was set in 1991.
Central government support for spending on local roads will amount to Pounds
2.7bn in the Survey period, but will be reduced from previous plans by
Pounds 120m in 1994-95 and Pounds 70m in 1995-96.
The department's programmes also include the external financing limits of
British Rail (BR), London Transport (LT) and the Civil Aviation Authority
(CAA). Total funding for BR (including Railtrack) over the Survey period
will average over Pounds 900m a year. This should allow investment of over
Pounds 1bn in 1994-95.
The new plans for LT show total EFLs of Pounds 900m in 1994-95, Pounds 930m
in 1995-96 and Pounds 990m in 1996-97. These include Pounds 493/437/417m for
the Jubilee Line extension and Pounds 34/16/14m to support the Crossrail
project. CAA plans have been reduced over the period largely as a result of
the new air traffic control centre in Scotland proceeding as a financially
free-standing private sector project.
The Housing Corporation's capital programme has been reduced from previous
plans but will comfortably meet the manifesto commitment to provide more
than 153,000 additional social rented homes through housing associations
between 1992-93 and 1994-95. The Housing Corporation's overall spending
continues at a level of over Pounds 1.6b a year from 1994-95 to 1996-97.
Provision for local authority capital spending on housing in 1994-95 and
1995-96 has also been reduced from last year's plans, but remains
substantial. It rises from around Pounds 900m in each of these years to over
Pounds 1bn in 1996-97. Estate Action spending has been transferred to the
single regeneration budget.
The new plans show the resources being brought together from DOE's programme
and other departmental programmes into the SRB, announced on 4 November,
which will be used to support local partnerships carrying out regeneration
measures. The SRB is over Pounds 1.4bn in 1994-95 and over Pounds 1.3bn in
both 1995-96 and 1996-97, and will be administered through new integrated
regional offices.
The budget for countryside, water and environmental protection programmes
has been set at over Pounds 400m a year over the survey period.
PSA Projects was privatised in December 1992 and the five PSA building
management businesses were privatised in September and October 1993. The new
plans provide for the cost of residual central functions, including the
redundancy costs of staff returning from secondment.
The new plans reflect the priority the government gives to maintaining law
and order and tackling crime. Provision for the police allows current levels
of policing to be maintained and for the introduction of the reforms
announced in the recent White Paper. Over the next three years Pounds 100m
will be spent on measures to tackle juvenile crime. Over the same period the
number of places at existing prisons will be increased by over 2,000. Six
new prisons and secure training centres for persistent juvenile offenders
will be privately financed.
Reductions of Pounds 50m in 1994-95 and Pounds 60m in 1995-96 compared with
previous plans have been achieved despite forecast workload growth in the
courts and prosecution services. Provision increases by Pounds 100m in
1996-97. Within these totals legal aid provision has been increased to cover
increases in workload while reflecting the lord chancellor's policy of
limiting growth in unit costs from 1996-97 to the increase in inflation. The
level of court services will be maintained in line with anticipated demand.
Prosecution services will also be producing efficiency gains while
responding to demand.
Total spending by central government in England (including support for local
authorities) will rise by over Pounds 1 1/2 bn between 1993-94 and 1996-97.
Current expenditure on higher education will increase by 3 per cent in real
terms over the survey period. This should maintain at almost one in three
the proportion of young people entering higher education compared with one
in eight in 1979, stabilising student numbers after the recent rapid
expansion. Total support available for individual students from loans and
maintenance grant will be maintained in real terms while the shift from
grant to loans will be accelerated. Capital funding to higher education
institutions will rise by 20 per cent in real terms between 1993-94 and
1996-97.
The new plans also provide for a 19 per cent increase in student numbers in
further education and sixth form colleges over the survey period.
Provision for capital and other special purpose grants to self-governing
(grant-maintained) schools is planned to rise from Pounds 160m in 1993-94 to
Pounds 590m in 1996-97 in support of this growing sector. Government support
for capital spending on all maintained schools in 1994-95 will remain at
broadly the same level as in 1993-94.
The plans include finance for the new British Library building and the costs
associated with the move, and for restoring Windsor Castle. Priority will be
given to projects which attract matching private finance. There is a small
increase in provision for the Arts Council compared with previous plans.
Provision for the programme as a whole will be Pounds 31.7bn in 1994-95, an
increase of Pounds 1.8bn over 1993-94 plans. Cash provision for the NHS in
England will be Pounds 1.6bn (5.6 per cent) higher in 1994-95 than in
1993-94 plans, while for the UK as a whole it is likely to rise by nearly
Pounds 2bn.
Total current spending on hospital and community health services (HCHS) in
England is planned to be 5.4 per cent higher in 1994-95 than in 1993-94. As
announced by the secretary of state for health on 21 October, the management
structure of the NHS in England will be streamlined to maximise the
proportion of NHS expenditure devoted to direct patient care. HCHS capital
provision of Pounds 1.8bn remains at near-record levels and allows for the
full costs of rationalising London's health services. Provision for the
family health services allows for forecast demand while reflecting the
government's determination to restrain the growth in the drugs bill to what
is necessary to meet patients' needs. Centrally financed services will
continue to be funded in line with government priorities, after a
fundamental re-examination to eliminate low priority and unnecessary
expenditure.
The government proposes a number of changes to the benefit system which
affect both cyclical social security and spending within the NCT.
The new plans include extra help for the higher fuel bills of pensioners
following the introduction of VAT next April. The government proposes to
restructure invalidity benefit and increase the contributions made by
non-dependent members of households in assessing housing benefit. It intends
to make employers fully responsible for paying statutory sick pay, with an
exemption for small companies. Costs to business will be lower after the
Budget because of reductions in employer national insurance contribution
rates. The government will also introduce in 1994 a disregard in family
credit to meet part of the cost of childcare.
The plans allow for revised estimates of the number of beneficiaries, and
provide for further uprating of benefits in April 1995 and April 1996.
The government also intends to equalise the state pension age at 65. The
change will be phased in over 10 years, starting in the year 2010.
Changes in these programmes mainly reflect the effect of changes in
comparable programmes for England. As in past years, the decisions of the
secretaries of state for scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the
distribution of resources within their responsibilities will be announced
later. For present purposes, a notional split between programmes has been
assumed, taking account of the pattern of spending in 1993-94.
Most of the spending of the chancellor's departments is accounted for by the
Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise and is largely running costs. The new
plans for the chancellor's departments include substantial running costs
savings reflecting further increases in efficiency and containment of costs.
The new plans also reflect reduced estimates of expenditure on mortgage
interest relief to non-taxpayers.
Provision for basic and strategic research will be slightly higher in real
terms in 1994-95. This will provide the resources required to implement the
policies in the recent White Paper on science, engineering and technology.
Net payments are lower in 1994-95, but higher in other years, compared with
the previous forecast. The uneven profile arises because contributions are
paid on the basis of agreed estimates and adjusted in the light of outturn,
and because of the consequential effects on the UK abatement. The main
reason for the higher level of net payments in 1993-94 is the likely advance
of contributions within the 1994 EC budgetary year, to reflect the timing of
reimbursements of CAP expenditure to member states.
The lower level of net payments in 1994-95 is largely due to adjustments for
1993 contributions. In the later years, factors affecting the profile
include higher levels of EC spending, reflecting decisions at the Edinburgh
European Council in December 1992, and higher contributions in 1995 because
of the United Kingdom's higher growth relative to other member states.
Spending on the science base (basic research in science, engineering and
technology funded through the Research Councils and the Higher Education
Funding Councils) will increase slightly in real terms to Pounds 2.3bn in
1994-95. Total planned central government spending on civil science and
technology will be about Pounds 3.7bn, broadly in line with last year's
plans.
Total local authority spending is made up of expenditure financed through
central government support and expenditure net of capital receipts financed
by local authorities out of their own resources (local authority
self-financed expenditure).
The level of total local authority spending in future years will be
substantially for local authorities themselves to decide in the light of
central government support, finance available from their own resources and
the implications for local taxation. The government intends to use its
powers to cap local authority budgets should that be necessary.
Total standard spending (TSS) - the amount which the government thinks local
authorities should spend on revenue expenditure - in England in 1994-95 has
been set at Pounds 42,660 million. The government has for the first time
also announced TSS levels for the later years of the Survey to assist local
authorities in their financial planning. The figures are Pounds 44,050m in
1995-96 and Pounds 45,210m in 1996-97. These figures include amounts for
care in the community, part of which will be paid as a special grant.
Excluding care in the community and adjusting for other function changes,
the increases on the preceding year are 2.3 per cent in 1994-95, 2 per cent
in 1995-96 and 1.75 per cent in 1996-97.
Aggregate external finance (AEF) - central support for revenue expenditure -
is planned to be 1.7 per cent higher in 1994-95 (after adjusting for
function changes).
Gross capital expenditure by local authorities in 1994-95 is assumed to be
around Pounds 8 1/2 bn. It is expected to be lower than spending in 1993-94,
which was boosted considerably by the temporary relaxation of the capital
receipts rules announced in the 1992 Autumn Statement. Capital receipts in
1994-95 are projected to be around Pounds 2 3/4 bn, giving net capital
expenditure of Pounds 5 3/4 bn.
In addition to expenditure within the control total, GGE also includes
cyclical social security, privatisation proceeds and debt interest (see
accompanying table).
Cyclical social security is defined as unemployment benefit and income
support paid to people of working age. Planned spending on cyclical social
security in 1994-95 is 1.8 per cent higher in real terms than 1993-94. The
average annual growth in the three years to 1996-97 is 1.6 per cent.
The plans also take account of the effect of the government's proposed Job
Seekers Allowance. This will replace unemployment benefit and income support
for unemployed people from April 1996. The benefit will be paid either on a
contributory basis for six months without a means test or as income support
is at present. Thereafter benefit will be paid on a means tested basis.
There is also help with higher fuel bills for those on income-related
benefits. The Budget measures reduce cyclical social security by Pounds
0.3bn in 1996-97.
Privatisation proceeds are projected to be Pounds 5 1/2 bn in 1994-95,
Pounds 1bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 1bn in 1996-97.
The spending and revenue measures in the Budget will reduce government
borrowing and debt. This is estimated to reduce debt interest payments by
Pounds 0.2bn in 1994-95, Pounds 0.6bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 1.2bn in
1996-97.
General government gross debt interest is projected to rise from Pounds 18bn
in 1992-93 to about Pounds 26bn in 1996-97. Gross debt interest payments
declined as a proportion of GDP from 5 1/4 per cent in 1981-82 to about 3
per cent in 1992-93. But with the public finances moving into deficit in
recent years debt interest payments are projected to rise to about 3 1/4 per
cent by 1996-97.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: GDP growth forecast lifted to 1 3/4% for 1993;
inflation to rise and fall again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section explains in detail recent developments in the economy and its
short-term prospects.
G7 growth slowed in the first half of 1993 and is forecast to be only 1 per
cent in the year as a whole. Faster, but still modest, growth is projected
for 1994. Inflation in the major countries is forecast to continue falling.
In the UK, growth has been stronger than expected at the time of the March
Budget and is now forecast at 1 3/4 per cent in 1993. The 1994 forecast is a
rise in GDP of 2 1/2 per cent, slightly below the average of the forecasts
from the Panel of Independent Forecasters.
Underlying RPI inflation has been lower than forecast in the March Budget.
It is likely to rise in the first half of 1994 because of the short-run
impact of tax changes. But it is forecast to remain within the Government's
1 to 4 per cent target range and to fall back to 3 1/4 per cent by the end
of the year. The average forecast from the Independent Panel is marginally
lower.
Unemployment has fallen 137,000 since the beginning of the year and is now
below 2.9m, a much better outcome than generally expected.
The current account deficit in 1992 has been revised down to Pounds 8 1/2
bn, with the invisible surplus stronger than in recent years. Despite a
fallback in the invisible surplus and stronger growth in the UK than in
continental Europe, our main export market, the current account deficit is
expected to increase only slightly in 1993. It is forecast to be Pounds 9
1/2 bn in both 1993 and 1994.
The sterling index has been fairly steady this year. Long-term interest
rates have fallen significantly reflecting lower inflation expectations.
The PSBR in the current financial year is expected to be very close to the
Pounds 50bn forecast in March. As a result of Budget measures and economic
recovery it is forecast to fall to Pounds 38bn in 1994-95.
The forecast is based on the conventional assumption that sterling remains
close to recent levels. Oil prices are assumed to average Dollars 17 a
barrel.
World economy
The pick-up in world economic growth most forecasters were predicting at the
time of the March Budget has been slow to materialise. Growth in the US in
the first half of the year was less than forecast, though it seems to have
recovered strongly in the second half. Japanese GDP and industrial
production fell again in the second quarter. And although activity in
continental Europe may have stabilised there are few clear signs of
recovery; confidence remains low in most European countries.
For the major seven countries (G7) as a whole, industrial production stopped
falling towards the end of 1992, but there has been little recovery yet;
weakness in Japan and continental Europe has largely offset rises in the US.
GDP growth in the G7 between the second half of 1992 and the first half of
1993 slowed to under 1 per cent at an annual rate, compared with growth of 1
3/4 per cent in 1992.
Against this background, policy has remained expansionary in the US, and
there has been a steady easing in continental Europe and Japan. US
short-term interest rates have been around 3 per cent for over a year,
consistent with a real interest rate close to zero. In Japan the official
discount rate has been cut to a record low of 1 3/4 per cent, and the
government has introduced a further stimulatory fiscal package - the third
in just over a year. In continental Europe, however, despite cuts in nominal
rates, real interest rates remain higher than usual at a cyclical trough.
Fiscal deficits in Europe have risen sharply, partly because of the
recession.
Weak activity in the major countries has kept non-oil commodity prices close
to their lowest level in real terms since the early 1970s. The Brent oil
price has fallen since the spring, dropping below Dollars 15 a barrel
towards the end of November, compared with over Dollars 18 in the first half
of the year. It has averaged just under Dollars 16 1/2 a barrel in the last
three months and is assumed to average Dollars 17 a barrel during the
forecast period.
Low commodity prices have contributed to a continued easing of inflationary
pressure in the major countries. Since the beginning of the year consumer
price inflation has fallen  3/4 per cent in Germany and  1/2 per cent in the
US, and has been steady at historically low levels in France and Italy. In
Japan, inflation fell below 1 per cent in the early summer before rising
again as poor weather temporarily boosted food prices. Weak inflationary
pressures and falling inflation expectations have contributed to a rally in
world bond markets, taking long-term interest rates down to their lowest
levels since the late 1960s.
GDP growth in the G7 is forecast to be 1 per cent in 1993. This is  1/2
percentage point below the March Budget forecast, reflecting weaker than
expected activity in the first half of the year and only patchy signs of
recovery in the second half. Growth is forecast to rise to 2 per cent in
1994, but with recovery still some way off in Japan and continental Europe,
marked differences between the growth rates of individual countries are
likely to persist.
In the US, growth of around 2 3/4 per cent is forecast for 1993 and 1994,
close to the rate in 1992. This continues the pattern of fairly modest
recovery since the trough in early 1991. Following substantial upward
revisions to past GDP data, the recent US recession looks to have been one
of the shallowest since the war, implying less scope for the very rapid
growth rates recorded in previous recoveries.
In Japan, GDP is now forecast to fall by  1/4 per cent in 1993. This would
be the first annual fall since 1974. Although last year's fiscal package is
beginning to provide a boost to public sector demand, private demand has
been much weaker than expected. With the high yen now likely to restrain
export volumes, growth is forecast to be only 1 per cent in 1994.
GDP in western Germany may be levelling out, at around 2 1/2 per cent below
its early 1992 peak. But prospective tax increases and the deterioration in
competitiveness over the past two years are expected to hold back recovery
next year. Although output in the east continues to rise, growth in Germany
as a whole is forecast to be only  3/4 per cent in 1994, following a fall in
output of 1 1/2 per cent this year.
GDP in the European Community is forecast to fall by  1/2 per cent in 1993,
and recover by only 1 1/4 per cent in 1994, similar to the recent Commission
forecast. EC unemployment has risen from 8 1/2 per cent in 1990 to 10 3/4 .
Growth in 1994 is unlikely to be sufficient to prevent further increases in
unemployment over the next year.
Low commodity prices and spare capacity in G7 countries should continue to
exert downward pressure on inflation. Consumer price inflation in the G7 is
forecast to fall from its current level of 2 3/4 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent
by the fourth quarter of 1994 and 2 1/4 per cent by mid-1995. The largest
fall is likely to be in Germany where inflation - currently second highest
in the G7 - is forecast to be below 2 1/2 per cent by the first half of
1995.
Growth of world trade in manufactures is forecast to slow from 5 per cent in
1992 to 2 3/4 per cent in 1993, as a result of the slowdown in continental
Europe and Japan. Growth elsewhere in East Asia and in Latin American
countries has remained buoyant, and imports to the US have been surprisingly
strong. But in Europe - the UK's main export market - weak domestic demand
appears to have depressed imports severely (although trade volumes may have
been distorted by the introduction of Intrastat, the new system for
recording intra-European Community trade). As a result, UK export markets
are forecast to grow by only 1 1/4 per cent this year, 1 1/2 percentage
points less than world trade. With faster growth in the industrialised
countries, growth of world trade is forecast to be stronger in 1994 than in
1993, at around 5 1/4 per cent. Growth of UK export markets is also expected
to increase but to remain below that of world trade.
UK demand and output
As a result of the rebasing of the national accounts to 1990 prices and
other data revisions, the trough in GDP is now estimated to have occurred in
the first quarter of 1992. During the recession non-oil GDP fell by 3 3/4
per cent, rather less than the 5 1/4 per cent fall in the early 1980s
recession.
The recovery has proceeded fairly steadily so far, with an uninterrupted
expansion in GDP of 2 1/2 per cent over the six quarters to the third
quarter of 1993. Output has risen in most sectors. North Sea oil and gas
output has risen particularly strongly, the fruit of heavy investment in
recent years. Output has increased by about 2 1/2 per cent in both
manufacturing and services, and service sector output is now above the level
seen at the peak of the cycle.
The impetus to recovery has come mainly from consumer spending and exports.
Since the trough in output, consumer spending has contributed 2 per cent to
the growth in GDP and exports 1 3/4 per cent. Stocks too made some initial
contribution. During 1992 the positive contribution of exports was more than
offset by rising imports, but this year exports have accelerated, despite
weak demand in continental Europe, and import growth has fallen. Some
improvement in trade performance was to be expected in the wake of gains in
competitiveness, but its extent is uncertain given the change in the way
intra-European Community trade has been recorded since the turn of the year.
While the recovery so far has been remarkably smooth, it would not be
surprising if the profile of output were more uneven from now on.
Nevertheless growth is expected to continue in the final quarter of 1993.
Although growth in manufacturing output appeared to falter over the summer,
business surveys point to resumed expansion, albeit at a modest pace. North
Sea output is rising and there is little sign of a break in the upward trend
in consumer demand, much of which is reflected in higher output in the
service sector. So GDP growth in 1993 is now forecast to be 1 3/4 per cent,
a stronger performance than forecast in the March Budget.
Faster growth is forecast for 1994, with GDP increasing by 2 1/2 per cent, 2
1/4 per cent excluding North Sea oil. This acceleration largely reflects a
pick-up in business spending: improved company finances and modest increases
in capacity utilisation should boost spending on fixed assets and stocks.
Export growth should increase a little as continental Europe recovers,
although imports are forecast to grow more strongly too. Annual growth in
non-oil GDP is forecast to be slightly stronger again in the first half of
1995, but with growth of North Sea output slowing, total GDP growth is
forecast to remain at 2 1/2 per cent.
Personal sector and the housing market
Consumer spending started to recover in the second quarter of 1992, having
fallen 3 3/4 per cent in the recession. By the third quarter of 1993 most of
this fall had been reversed, with spending rising on average by  1/2 per
cent a quarter. The initial recovery followed a substantial fall in interest
rates and was accompanied by strong growth in real personal disposable
income. This year, however, growth of aggregate real incomes has weakened
and the saving ratio has fallen from 12 3/4 per cent in 1992 to an estimated
11 3/4 per cent in the first three quarters of the year. Weaker real income
growth is mainly the result of the slowdown in real average earnings growth
and smaller increases in dividend income following strong growth in 1992.
Events of the past 18 months have shown that consumer demand can recover
while the housing market remains weak. Even so, a stronger housing market
would help underpin the consumer recovery. The housing market has shown
signs of emerging from its slump, but both turnover and prices have moved
erratically in 1993. It is clear that the Autumn Statement package of
measures designed to take empty properties off the market played an
important role in the recovery of turnover in the early months of the year.
Indeed there was a small surge in housing starts in the spring as builders
sought to replace properties sold into the programme. While the early pace
of recovery was not sustained, with some weakening in the summer, activity
and prices in the third quarter were both well above their troughs.
With mortgage rates at their lowest levels since 1969 and house prices lower
in relation to incomes than since 1985, home ownership is more affordable
than for many years. Now that prices are rising, unemployment is falling and
there is a growing perception of more general recovery, increasing
confidence should lead to higher activity and prices in 1994.
Personal sector spending is likely to remain restrained by past standards,
given a desire for further balance sheet adjustment. Nevertheless there are
reasons for expecting a further decline in the saving ratio. Unemployment
has begun to fall, reducing the need for precautionary saving. Inflation is
forecast to remain low, reducing the need of households to save to maintain
the real value of their financial wealth, and lower interest rates have
eased the burden of household debt.
A decline in the saving ratio combined with continued growth in real
personal disposable income should permit consumption to increase in 1994 at
around its recent rate. Despite the tax increases due to take effect, real
personal disposable income could rise by 1 per cent in 1994, the same as in
1993, largely reflecting recoveries in self-employment and net investment
incomes. Numbers of self-employed in work have been increasing and net
investment income is being boosted by lower interest rates and high rates of
net accumulation of financial assets. In addition there is the prospect of
rising real income from wages and salaries before tax. Consumers'
expenditure is forecast to rise by 2 1/4 per cent in 1994, following an
increase of 2 per cent in 1993. Personal sector investment in dwellings -
which includes both new houses and improvements to existing houses - is
expected to grow faster than for several years as housing market activity
increases.
Although the saving ratio is forecast to fall and housing investment to
rise, the personal sector financial balance is projected to remain in
sizeable surplus in 1994 - around 6 per cent of personal disposable income.
The debt/income ratio has fallen over the past couple of years. And with
interest payments falling sharply as a result of lower interest rates, the
burden of debt is much reduced.
Corporate sector and investment
Following concerted efforts to cut costs, the corporate sector has now begun
to reap the benefits. Having been more or less static through the recession,
industrial and commercial companies' (ICCs) profits in the first three
quarters of 1993 were 14 per cent up on a year earlier. With sharply reduced
short-term interest payments, down a quarter, and further reductions in tax
payments, company saving (undistributed income) is estimated to have risen
by about a third over the same period.
Profitability, as measured by the real rate of return, is expected to be
well up in 1993 on its 1992 level. In 1994 it is forecast to pick up further
as recovery strengthens, labour costs remain in check, and pressure on
margins eases further. Despite higher tax payments in 1994, higher profits
are expected to carry through into a further marked increase in company
saving.
Business investment in the first three quarters of 1993 was 1 3/4 per cent
down on a year earlier, although manufacturing investment rose slightly and
North Sea investment increased by 7 per cent. But at its projected trough in
the second half of 1993, business investment as a share of GDP is still
above the levels seen between 1970 and the mid-1980s.
Investment intentions have improved over the past year, and are now pointing
to modest growth in manufacturing investment over the year ahead. Moreover
the improvement in companies' profitability and balance sheets will ease
constraints on investment. The degree of spare capacity will, on the other
hand, continue to be a restraining influence until recovery is further
advanced. Business investment is forecast to rise by 3 3/4 per cent in 1994
and by 4 1/2 per cent in the year to the first half of 1995.
General government investment in fixed assets rose 8 1/4 per cent in volume
terms in 1992, and is projected to rise by a further 11 3/4 per cent in
1993, in part due to the temporary relaxation of the rules for spending out
of local authority capital receipts. In 1994 it is forecast to fall 3 per
cent, as this temporary measure unwinds. But government investment is
projected to remain at historically high levels.
Fixed investment in the economy as a whole is forecast to grow by  1/2 per
cent in 1993 and by 3 per cent in 1994, reflecting the forecast pick-up in
business and housing investment which more than compensates for lower
general government investment.
Typically stockbuilding makes a positive contribution to growth during
periods of economic upswing. The slowdown in the rate of destocking in 1992
contributed  3/4 per cent to GDP growth, following three years when the
stock cycle made a negative contribution. But this year, with destocking
continuing at much the same rate as in 1992, stocks are expected to make
only a small contribution to growth. Stocks are forecast to contribute  1/2
per cent to growth in 1994 as stockbuilding resumes.
Latest information suggests that ICCs moved into small financial surplus in
the first three quarters of 1993, for the first time since 1987. The
expected buoyancy of company saving and relatively modest growth of capital
spending imply a larger financial surplus in 1994. This would partly restore
the damage done to company balance sheets by the substantial deficits
incurred in the five years to 1992, and particularly in 1989 and 1990.
Labour market
Employment rose between March and June 1993, for the first time in three
years. The fall in employment during the recession was partly associated
with a productivity performance which was abnormally strong for a cyclical
downturn, perhaps reflecting the effects of labour market reforms. Although
the recent turnround in employment was accompanied by a slowdown in
productivity growth, non-oil productivity in the second quarter of 1993 was
still 3 3/4 per cent up on a year earlier, and manufacturing productivity in
the third quarter was 5 per cent up. As the recovery becomes more
established, annual productivity growth could fall further from its recent
high rates.
Unemployment rose by 1.4m between April 1990 and its peak in January 1993 -
considerably less than the fall in employment. But by October 1993 it had
fallen 137,000. This is a much better performance than expected by most at
the time of the March Budget.
Trade and the balance of payments
The introduction from 1 January of a new system for recording visible trade
with the European Community - Intrastat - has made it extremely difficult to
interpret recent trade performance. Not only have the figures recorded in
the first few months of the new system been more liable to revision than
usual, but some of the movements - such as sharply divergent changes in
imports from the European Community and from elsewhere - are difficult to
explain. Due to the new method of collection there may well have been a
break in the European Community trade figures at the start of the year,
implying that year-on-year growth rates in 1993 are unreliable. Part of the
problem may lie with the split of values into prices and volumes. As the new
system settles down, however, shorter period movements should become more
reliable. In the meantime the forecast gives more weight to the fundamental
influences on trade performance than to recent outturns.
The main influences on actual trade flows over the next year or so are the
improvement in competitiveness already achieved and the cyclical position in
the UK compared with elsewhere. Cost competitiveness so far in 1993 has
turned out much as expected. Unit labour cost performance in the UK has been
unusually good. In 1993 as a whole, unit labour costs in manufacturing could
be 1 per cent lower than in 1992, and they are forecast to remain unchanged
in 1994. By contrast competitors' unit labour costs have been rising and are
expected to continue to rise. Cost competitiveness, after allowing for
exchange rate changes, was probably around 20 per cent better in the third
quarter of 1993 than a year earlier, and is forecast to remain close to that
level during 1994. On the recorded figures export price competitiveness has
improved much less. This may partly reflect exporters taking the opportunity
of the lower exchange rate to widen profit margins which had previously been
squeezed, but it is also possible that the recorded increase in export
prices is too high.
The recorded figures for imports so far this year are lower than past
experience would have suggested. Although the effect of the improvement in
competitiveness may have been stronger than in the past, it is possible that
the import volume figures in 1993 are understated by comparison with the
figures for earlier years. The sharp fall in imports from the European
Community is particularly difficult to understand against a background of
little change in imports from elsewhere. Recorded non-oil import volume
growth may be only 2 1/2 per cent in 1993, following a rise of 7 per cent in
1992.
The forecast assumes that the usual relationships between the growth of
imports, domestic demand, and competitiveness are re-established from now
on. These point to UK imports growing faster than UK domestic demand,
reflecting the progressive specialisation of world production. Increased
specialisation is evident in the consistently higher rates of growth for
measures of world trade than for measures of world demand and output.
Although improved competitiveness will be a moderating influence on import
growth, its effect is unlikely to be strong enough to bring underlying
import growth below domestic demand growth. Non-oil imports are forecast to
increase by 5 3/4 per cent in 1994.
The sustained improvement in competitiveness will help UK exporters to
increase their market penetration. But overseas demand is itself weak. UK
export markets may grow by only a little more than 1 per cent in 1993
because of the particular weakness of demand in continental Europe. In 1994,
however, UK export markets are forecast to rise 4 per cent. Recorded non-oil
exports may be around 3 1/2 per cent higher in volume terms in 1993 than in
1992. But the statistical problems discussed earlier may have reduced
recorded export growth - actual growth may have been somewhat stronger. In
1994 non-oil export growth is forecast to be around 5 1/4 per cent.
Recorded prices for both exports and imports have moved erratically in 1993,
with no clear trends. Non-oil import prices have risen about 10 per cent in
the year to the third quarter, less than exchange rate and world price
changes would imply. This may be because importers are finding it difficult
to pass on the exchange rate effects fully in the face of low consumer and
producer price inflation in the UK. Non-oil export prices have also risen 10
per cent - again a good deal slower than world prices measured in sterling.
Comparing 1993 as a whole with 1992, the terms of trade, as recorded, may
improve by around 1 1/4 per cent, recovering from their sharp fall in the
immediate aftermath of last year's devaluation. Little change is expected in
1994.
North Sea output rose 8 per cent in 1992 and it has risen even faster during
1993. In 1993 as a whole, output is expected to be around 15 per cent higher
than in 1992, with a further rise of nearly 20 per cent forecast in 1994.
Oil output is expected to be in the upper half of the 1993 Brown Book range.
Gas output, which has increased strongly this year, is forecast to rise
further. As a consequence of higher production, the surplus on trade in oil
is forecast to rise to Pounds 4bn in 1994, its highest since 1987.
The surplus on invisibles in 1992 was Pounds 5bn well above early estimates.
The surplus on net interest, profits and dividends (IPD) was particularly
strong in the second half of the year, at Pounds 4bn, compared with under
Pounds 2bn in the first half. But much of the increase probably resulted
from abnormally high activity in the foreign exchange markets around the
time of last year's ERM crisis. High IPD surpluses have not been sustained
in the first half of 1993. And the balance of transfers - consisting largely
of net transfers to the European Community and aid and other government
spending overseas - has continued to deteriorate.
The balance on services, on the other hand, which was depressed by insurance
claims relating to Hurricane Andrew in the second half of 1992, rebounded
strongly in the first half of 1993. It should also benefit from the
improvement in competitiveness. Exports of services are forecast to rise by
4 per cent in volume terms in 1994, slightly more than in 1993. Imports of
services could grow by 4 3/4 per cent in 1994 following a small fall in
1993. But an increase in the services balance is unlikely to be sufficient
to offset the deterioration in IPD and transfers. Overall the surplus on
invisibles is projected to be Pounds 2bn in 1993, well down on the previous
year. It is forecast to fall a little further in 1994.
The current account deficit in 1992 has been revised down to Pounds 8 1/2 bn
from Pounds 12bn estimated at the time of the March Budget. The deficit is
forecast to widen slightly to Pounds 9 1/2 bn in 1993, with a fall in the
invisible surplus partly offset by a smaller visible deficit, and to remain
at that level in 1994.
Inflation
Both cost and price inflation have been significantly lower during 1993 than
forecast a year ago and in the March Budget. Despite the depreciation of
sterling, underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage
interest payments (MIPs), is expected to be lower at the end of 1993 than at
the end of 1992. There are clearly considerable domestic disinflationary
pressures.
Underlying average earnings growth was 3 per cent in September, down from 5
1/2 per cent a year earlier. Pay settlements have also continued to fall.
Latest data from the CBI show the average of settlements in manufacturing
and services at about 2 1/2 per cent in the third quarter, compared to over
4 per cent a year earlier. On its own, this would point to further falls in
earnings growth because settlements take time to feed through fully. On the
other hand, there may be some upward pressure on earnings as profits
increase and labour markets become less slack.
Falling earnings growth combined with strong productivity growth has led to
exceptionally good unit wage cost performance this year. Unit wage costs in
manufacturing were  1/2 per cent lower than a year earlier in the third
quarter, and in the year as a whole are forecast to be around 1 per cent
lower than in 1992. In the private sector, unit wage costs are forecast to
increase only marginally between 1992 and 1993.
Falling unit wage costs in large part explain why producer prices have
remained unexpectedly subdued, despite higher import prices and some
rebuilding of profit margins. Producer output price inflation rose to 3.2
per cent in October, from a low point of 2.0 per cent in the autumn of 1992.
Producer input prices had shown more of an impact from import prices earlier
this year. But in the year to October they increased by only 1.0 per cent,
further evidence of a squeeze on importers' margins.
Producer output price inflation is forecast to be 3 1/4 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1993. It may then rise a little, as manufacturers continue
to rebuild margins against the background of less favourable movements in
unit wage costs and adjustment to higher import prices. But as these factors
run their course, producer output price inflation is forecast to fall back
to 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1994 and 2 3/4 per cent by mid-1995.
Underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding MIPs, fell to 2.8 per
cent in early summer; its lowest rate since 1968. It rose subsequently, but
this was fully reversed by a sharp fall back to 2.8 per cent in October.
Underlying inflation is forecast to rise somewhat during the first half of
1994, while remaining within the Government's 1 to 4 per cent target range,
before falling back to 3 1/4 per cent by the end of the year. This temporary
increase in underlying inflation reflects the short-run impact of tax
changes. Over-indexation of excise duties, the new taxes in the Budget, and
the first tranche of VAT on domestic fuel and power announced in the March
Budget, are together estimated to add  3/4 percentage point to the annual
rate of underlying inflation in the fourth quarter of 1994. Underlying
inflation is forecast to fall further by the second quarter of 1995, to 3
per cent.
Given the path of underlying RPI inflation, the outlook for the all-items
rate will depend on what happens to mortgage rates. Other things being equal
a 1 percentage point change in mortgage rates changes the level of the
all-items RPI by just over  1/2 per cent.
The prospects for the GDP deflator (which measures the price of domestic
value added - principally unit labour costs and profits per unit of output)
differ from those for retail prices primarily because of its wider coverage.
The GDP deflator is forecast to rise by 3 1/4 per cent in 1993-94,
increasing to 4 per cent in 1994-95. This mainly reflects a forecast
acceleration in investment goods prices from very low levels.
Financial developments
Sterling has been relatively stable this year. Following a short period of
weakness in February and March, the sterling index has mostly traded in the
range 79 to 82; over the past three months it has averaged 80 1/2 . Against
the Deutschemark it has averaged DM2.48, 12 1/2 per cent below its average
level during the three months prior to suspension from the ERM. Sterling was
not significantly affected by the turbulence in the European Monetary System
in the summer which ended in the widening of the permitted bands of
variation.
Base rates have been reduced twice this year, in January and November.
Short-term interest rates in the UK are currently the lowest in the European
Community. Long rates have fallen significantly. Ten-year gilt yields, which
stood at 8 1/4 per cent at the beginning of the year, have recently been
under 7 per cent. The fall in long rates reflects improved confidence in the
prospects for sustained low inflation.
Equity prices grew strongly after sterling's suspension from the ERM. They
have continued to rise in recent months, reaching new highs. The commercial
property market has remained subdued, though capital values may have stopped
falling. House prices, as measured by the Halifax index, have been erratic
though rising slightly in recent months.
The 12-month growth rate of M0 has been above its monitoring range for most
of this year; and in November it was just over 5 per cent. A period of
relatively strong growth, and correspondingly low velocity growth, is not
surprising following the sharp cuts in interest rates which reduce the
incentive to economise on cash.
M4 growth has remained close to the bottom of the monitoring range set in
the March Budget. Low interest rates, relative to returns on other financial
assets, reduce the attractiveness of deposits as a savings medium.
The growth of M4 lending - bank and building society lending to the private
sector - has remained weak. The 12-month growth rate has mostly been between
3 and 4 per cent throughout 1993. Company sector borrowing in particular has
remained weak, with industrial and commercial companies repaying bank
borrowing. Companies have moved into financial surplus, reducing their need
to borrow, and capital issues have been substantial, probably reflecting the
strength of the stock market. Lending for house purchase has been one of the
stronger areas, reflecting the rise in housing turnover.
Risks and uncertainties
All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. One way of assessing
their extent is to examine average errors from past forecasts, which are
shown in an accompanying table. The range of forecasts from the Independent
Panel is another indicator of the uncertainties, as is the evolution of the
forecasts over time. Successive Treasury forecasts of GDP growth in 1993
have been progressively revised up over the past year, while forecasts of
underlying inflation in the year to the fourth quarter of 1993 have been
revised down. The projected current account deficit for 1993 was increased
in March, but has since been revised down below last year's Autumn Statement
forecast, reflecting revisions to 1992 and lower than expected outturns so
far this year.

Jack Holmstock, 44
Job: taxi driver. Formerly worked in local government and recruitment
Earns: about pounds 22,000 a year and has a mortgage of pounds 50,000 on his
east London house
Politics: votes Conservative
Wanted: an interest rate cut. 'As a mortgage payer this would make a
difference to us in particular. It would also have a big knock-on effect -
firms would take more people on, and more people would use cabs.'
First reaction: 'It is going to cost me. The increase in petrol affects me.
So does the increase in car tax. I don't smoke or drink, only a little wine,
so I will not be hit there. But we run a pounds 50,000 mortgage here and the
decrease in mortgage tax relief is going to hurt. On the plus side I was
glad there was not VAT on food and books. Also, I have two parents on
pensions so I was pleased to see them getting help with fuel bills.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Drive for high growth and living standards - Red
Book details
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's economic objective is to promote sustained growth and
higher living standards. In delivering this objective, fiscal and monetary
policies are complemented by the government's continuing programme of
microeconomic reform. This programme is designed to improve the efficiency
of markets and strengthen the long-term supply performance of the economy.
The central purpose of this budget is to put the public finances on to a
sound basis, so that the economic recovery now under way can be sustained
over the medium term. The budget combines tight public expenditure restraint
with measures to raise revenue. It also includes a number of measures to
help large and small businesses, thus improving the prospect for jobs.
The budget measures on taxation and spending will reinforce the fall in the
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) as the economy recovers. The PSBR
path now projected is significantly below that in the March projections. The
budget should bring the PSBR back close to balance by 1998-99 (see
accompanying table), when the government will be borrowing only to finance
its net capital spending.
On the spending side, tight control over pay and running costs and savings
in a number of programmes contribute to substantial reductions. On the
revenue side, the main focus is on broadening the tax base rather than
increasing tax rates, while supporting environmental and health objectives.
The strategy for strengthening the supply side aims to make the economy more
responsive to market disciplines by enlarging the market sector, increasing
competition, deregulating, and improving the climate for enterprise,
particularly small businesses. The budget contains a number of measures
which contribute to this aim. There is a package of tax and national
insurance measures designed to help businesses, particularly smaller
businesses, and to reduce the cost of employing lower-paid workers.
On the spending side, more resources have been found for education and
health; provision has been made for a new apprenticeship scheme and further
measures to help people get jobs; and there are reforms to the social
security programme, including help with childcare costs for low income
working families. Additional help is given to exporters, and the budget
takes forward the government's commitment to encourage the private financing
of infrastructure projects and other capital expenditure which have hitherto
been undertaken by the public sector.
Measures to help business
More resources will go to raising skills: They will go to education
programmes to ensure record levels of participation in further and higher
education, and a new apprenticeship scheme will be introduced for the
training of young people. Spending on basic science and technology will be
maintained in real terms.
Promoting employment: Employers' national insurance contributions will be
reduced by 1 per cent for employees earning less than Pounds 200 a week and
0.2 per cent for others. This should more than offset the cost to business
of changes to statutory sick pay, which will encourage employers to manage
sickness absence better. There will also be measures to encourage people to
find work, including help with childcare costs for low-income working
families and a new Job Seekers' Allowance.
Promoting investment: More private finance will be levered into capital
projects. This will augment direct investment planned by the public sector,
averaging around Pounds 22bn over the next three years.
Help for finances: A new scheme will be introduced to relieve surplus
advance corporation tax (ACT) on dividends paid from foreign income. The
maximum real increase in business rates faced by businesses in transition to
higher rates will be halved; other businesses face no real increase. The
profits limits for the small companies' rate of corporation tax will be
raised by 20 per cent. The government will consult on measures to promote
prompt payment by means of legislation for interest on late payment and a
British Standard for prompt payment.
Regulatory burden reduced: The VAT registration threshold for smaller
businesses will be increased to Pounds 45,000, and statutory audit
requirements will be abolished for companies with a turnover below Pounds
90,000.
Investment in growing companies: A new Enterprise Investment Scheme will be
introduced; the government will consult on a Venture Capital Trust scheme;
and CGT reliefs will be extended.
Exporters: More help will be given through increased export credit cover and
lower premiums.
Choosing public spending priorities
Spending is reduced by Pounds 3.8bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1995-96.
By 1996-97, total spending is reduced by Pounds 4.4bn as a result of the
budget measures, equivalent to  1/2 per cent of GDP. This is achieved in
particular by the following.
Restraining public sector paybills and costs: Provision for civil service
running costs in the period 1994-95 to 1996-97 is frozen at broadly the
1993-94 level. A similar approach is applied to running costs in the rest of
the public sector.
Restraining the growth of social security: By reforming invalidity benefit
and benefits paid to the unemployed, and making employers fully responsible
for paying statutory sick pay with an exemption for small companies.
Savings on defence, housing, transport and other programmes: Within the
lower totals more resources go to priority programmes. In addition to the
measures to boost wealth creation, the new plans provide extra resources for
the Health Service in 1994-95 and allow for increases in real terms each
year. Extra help will be provided to pensioners and those on income-related
benefits to meet the cost of extra fuel bills as a result of the
introduction of VAT on fuel. The plans also fully protect the level of
spending on law and order.
Revenue measures for medium term
There will be a broader tax base: Income tax allowances and the basic rate
limit are unchanged for 1994-95. From April 1995 the value of the married
couple's allowance will be restricted to 15 per cent and tax relief for
mortgage interest payments will be reduced to 15 per cent. Most insurance
premiums will be taxed at 3 per cent.
A duty will be charged on air passengers of Pounds 5 for flights to
destinations within the EC, and Pounds 10 elsewhere. There are a number of
measures to protect revenue and block tax avoidance schemes.
Health and environmental aims: Tax on road fuels will rise by 3 pence per
litre and will be increased on average by at least 5 per cent a year in real
terms in future budgets. The tax on tobacco will rise by 11p on a packet of
20 cigarettes and on average by at least 3 per cent in real terms in future
budgets. VED on cars is raised by Pounds 5 to Pounds 130.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: PSBR in 1994-95 forecast to shrink back to Pounds
37.9bn - Government receipts set to rise by 10 per cent / North Sea revenues
expected to top Pounds 2bn as production picks up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section brings together the detailed forecasts of revenue, spending,
borrowing and debt for 1993-94 and 1994-95.
The presentation of the public sector accounts now reflects the chancellor's
commitment to draw a clear distinction between current and capital
transactions.
The outturn for the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in 1992-93
was Pounds 36.7bn, Pounds 1bn more than estimated in the March budget. The
latest forecast for 1993-94 is a PSBR of Pounds 49.8bn, equivalent to 7 per
cent of GDP. This forecast is only marginally changed from the March budget,
although there have been offsetting changes to some components. Taking into
account the new public expenditure plans and the tax changes announced in
this budget, the PSBR in 1994-95 is forecast to come down to Pounds 37.9bn,
or 5 per cent of GDP, the first year-on-year reduction since 1988-89.
Receipts in 1994-95 are expected to rise faster than money GDP, reflecting
both economic recovery and the tax increases announced in the March and
November budgets. And tight control of public expenditure is expected to
bring general government expenditure (GGE) growth below that of GDP, despite
a further sharp rise in debt interest payments.
The public sector financial deficit (PSFD) is forecast at 8 per cent of GDP
in 1993-94, falling to 6 per cent of GDP in 1994-95. The gap between the
PSBR and the PSFD - around  3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 - represents
various financial transactions, notably privatisation proceeds.
The difference between the public sector's financial deficit and its current
deficit is net capital expenditure (net of depreciation), less capital
transfers. The current deficit is expected to stand at 6 1/2 per cent of GDP
in 1993-94, falling to 4 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1994-95. The forecast
reduction in the PSFD in 1994-95 is primarily due to a lower current
deficit.
The general government financial deficit (GGFD) is expected to be a little
higher than the PSFD in 1993-94 at 8 3/4 per cent of GDP, reflecting the
small financial surplus projected for the public corporations sector. It is
forecast to fall to 6 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1994-95.
Public sector debt: The stock of net public sector debt at end-March 1993
was Pounds 201.5bn, 32 3/4 per cent of GDP. The latest forecast of the PSBR
for 1993-94 implies a rise to 38 1/2 per cent at end-March 1994, marginally
lower than projected in March, mainly because of a higher forecast level of
GDP. A further rise is in prospect to 41 3/4 per cent at end-March 1995.
General government gross debt is projected to rise from 41 per cent of GDP
at end-March 1993 to 49 per cent at end-March 1995.
The 1992-93 outturn: The PSBR in 1992-93 was around Pounds 1bn higher than
forecast in the March budget. This was more than explained by lower
receipts.
The 1993-94 forecast: The latest forecast of the 1993-94 PSBR is marginally
lower than the March budget. Expenditure is now forecast at around Pounds
1bn lower than in March; there is a slightly smaller downward revision to
the forecast of receipts. Although GDP growth is now expected to be a little
higher than forecast in March, revenues from most taxes have been running at
or below expectations. VAT receipts in particular have been weaker than
expected.
General government receipts are now expected to rise by 3 per cent in
1993-94. This is below the forecast growth in money GDP (5 1/2 per cent),
but compares with a rise in receipts of only  1/2 per cent recorded in
1992-93. Within this total:
the forecast of Inland Revenue receipts is more or less unchanged from the
March budget forecast;
income tax receipts are expected to be up on 1992-93, as are receipts of
petroleum revenue tax and stamp duties. But this is partly offset by lower
corporation tax;
the rise in Customs and Excise receipts in 1993-94 is weaker than in the
March Budget forecast. This is explained by a substantially lower forecast
of VAT receipts, in line with the outturn observed so far this year;
social security receipts are much as expected in March. But the forecast of
interest and dividend receipts is higher, reflecting the buoyant outturn to
date.
General government receipts are forecast to rise by 10 per cent in 1994-95,
significantly more than money GDP growth (6 1/2 per cent). Tax increases are
an important factor. The measures announced in the March budget but not due
to be implemented until 1994-95 will increase taxes by around Pounds 3.75bn
(mostly from income tax, social security contributions and VAT) as compared
with indexed 1993-94 levels. The November budget measures will increase
taxes in 1994-95 by a further Pounds 1.75bn.
Even without these measures, the projected increase in general government
receipts in 1994-95 would still be around 7 1/2 per cent, which is higher
than money GDP growth.
Within this forecast total for 1994-95:
Inland Revenue receipts are forecast to increase by 14 per cent from their
1993-94 level. Around a quarter of this is due to higher corporation tax,
reflecting a cyclical recovery. Most of the rest of the increase is due to
income tax, where receipts are boosted by the two sets of budget measures;
Customs and Excise receipts are forecast to rise by 11 per cent, of which
about half reflects the tax measures in the March and November budgets.
Without the two sets of budget measures, receipts would grow slightly faster
than consumer spending;
social security receipts are forecast to rise by 10 per cent, of which
around a third reflects the net impact of the two sets of budget changes.
North Sea revenues: North Sea revenues in 1993-94, at under Pounds 1.5bn,
are expected to be little higher than last year's outturn and Pounds 750m
lower than forecast in the March budget. Petroleum revenue tax (PRT)
receipts are expected to be marginally lower than forecast reflecting the
lower oil price. But corporation tax receipts are now expected to be more
than Pounds 500m lower, because of higher repayments of tax (caused by lower
settlements for old years) and lower liabilities in 1992. North Sea revenues
are expected to rise to over Pounds 2bn in 1994-95, as oil and gas
production picks up, and following the reforms to PRT in the March budget.
This would still represent less than  1/2 per cent of GDP, as compared with
a peak of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in the mid-1980s.
Taxes as a share of GDP: The ratio of tax and social security revenues to
GDP has fallen quite sharply since the onset of recession, from 37 per cent
in 1990-91 to 34 3/4 per cent in 1992-93. A further reduction to 34 per cent
is expected for 1993-94. Although output has been growing since mid-1992,
the cycle in tax revenues tends to lag behind that in economic activity.
Certain taxes - for example mainstream corporation tax and income tax on
self-employment income - are collected a year or so in arrears, and these
taxes are among those which show the greatest variability over the cycle.
With economic recovery continuing through 1993 and 1994, and the tax
measures announced in the March and November budgets taking effect, the tax
to GDP ratio should rise sharply in 1994-95. The forecast is for an increase
of nearly 1 1/2 percentage points in 1994-95.
Expenditure: General government expenditure (GGE) in 1993-94 is now put at
around Pounds 1bn below the March budget forecast. The control total is
expected to turn out between Pounds 250m and Pounds 500m below the public
spending plans. The main explanation of lower GGE outside of the control
total is lower cyclical social security spending which mainly reflects a
lower outturn for unemployment than assumed in the March Budget forecast.
For 1994-95, new control total spending is to be held to a cash rise of 2
3/4 per cent, which represents a fall of 1 1/4 per cent in real terms. And
although expenditure outside the control total is expected to rise somewhat
faster, the forecast growth in GGE excluding privatisation proceeds - 4 per
cent in cash terms, or zero in real terms - is much lower than for 1993-94.
Much of the growth in spending outside the control total is expected to come
from debt interest payments, reflecting the rising level of public sector
debt. Central government debt interest is expected to rise by 11 per cent in
1993-94, and by 16 per cent in 1994-95. General government debt interest
payments (which also includes local authorities' interest payments on
borrowing from the market) are now rising as a per cent of GDP following a
period of six years when the ratio was falling.
The forecast assumes privatisation proceeds of Pounds 5bn in 1994-95, a
similar level to the expected outturn for 1993-94.
Public sector capital expenditure, net of depreciation, is expected to total
around Pounds 14bn in 1993-94, an increase of Pounds 750m on 1992-93. There
will be a reduction in 1994-95 from the high real level of spending
maintained during the recession. However, this will be offset to some extent
by the impact of the private finance initiative, which will lead to
additional investment financed by the private sector in areas previously
regarded as public sector.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: How the seven wise men saw the chancellor's
performance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Britton
National Institute of Economic and Social Research
The main interest is on the public spending side. Some reforms of social
security were inevitable, but the changes to invalidity and unemployment
benefits will cause real hardship unless the economy expands more rapidly in
the medium term than we now expect. In the short term the cuts in public
spending were not properly explained, and may be hard to achieve.
On the tax side the measures were well chosen, but in my view there was no
need for tax increases on this scale. There is no need to eliminate the
PSBR; borrowing should match public investment in an average year.
Tim Congdon
Lombard Research
The surprise of the Budget was the large reduction in public spending
numbers. The spending total for 1994/95 is Pounds 3 1/2 bn below previous
plans. There are two reasons. First, the inflation assumption for 1994/95
has been reduced from 4 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent. Secondly, the Treasury
has cut the 'contingency reserve' in existing plans, from Pounds 7bn to
Pounds 3 1/2 bn.
The tax rises announced from 1994/95 were actually less than had been
expected at Pounds 1 3/4 bn. However, a number of further measures are being
phased in 1995/96, bring the total increase to nearly Pounds 5bn.
Overall, the Budget should be welcomed by financial markets.
David Currie
London Business School
Mr Clarke's first unified budget is politically highly astute.
He has skilfully defused the household fuel VAT row. As the London Business
School predicted in October, he has taken advantage of lower inflation and
the public pay freeze to cut public spending, with tough curbs on social
security. This, together with the absence of measures against the pensions
industry, will please the markets, but it will prove hard to hit the new
public spending targets beyond next year if inflation picks up.
The further reduction in mortgage tax relief, the modest extension of the
tax base, the action on tax avoidance and the introduction of road charges
all make good economic sense.
Gavyn Davies
Goldman Sachs International
Although it takes some calculated risk with the recovery next year, the
macro-economic measures in this Budget are quite brave and generally
sensible. The overall measures represent another necessary reversal of the
inappropriate budgetary easing in the second half of the 1980s.
Some of the tightening comes through lower public spending, which is partly
the result of declines in the contingency reserve, and will anyway be hard
to achieve in a re-election period. Nevertheless, this package should ensure
both that the public sector debt position is sustainable, and that the
dangerous rund down in net public sector assets will end by 1997/98.
Professor Wynne Godley
Cambridge University
I think the forecast is seriously incoherent because the projections of the
financial deficit looks inconsistent with the forecast for the balance of
payments and private savings. It projects a financial deficit of about
Pounds 55bn this year which must be about 8.5 per cent of GNP while the
balance of payments is said to be only 1.5 per cent.
I think the Budget judgment is probably along the right lines because such
expansion as we have seen is ill-structured and clearly based on the
consumer. But I think it will bring any expansion to an end.
Professor Patrick Minford
Liverpool University
This is a skilful Budget which has moved public spending control back to the
centre of the budgetary process - justifying the unified Budget. The
emphasis on public spending and reform of the welfare state is the most
important element: more detail will be needed and more reforms to build on
the start made here.
On the revenue side it was right to defer the extra burdens to 1995-96 and
to avoid raising any of the key marginal tax rates. The measures to broaden
the tax base and reduce mortgage interest relief are particularly welcome.
It is probable that the Treasury's PSBR projections are too pessimistic, so
that it should be possible to reduce marginal tax rates before the next
election.
Andrew Sentance
Confederation of British Industry
It was a skilful Budget which reduces public borrowing convincingly without
damaging short term recovery prospects. I think the particular points I
would welcome are the lower public spending plans; the fairly modest
short-term impact and the fact that he has avoided significant tax increases
on business.
However, if we take this together with the March budget the government's
fiscal policy will take a lot of spending power out of the economy and it
might be necessary to reduce interest rates further to sustain recovery.
The lower public borrowing justifies some further reduction.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Deputy Speaker, a politician presenting his first Budget is like a
lion-tamer trying out his act for the first time. I have decided to tackle
the difficulties I face in a direct way, on the basis of the clear policy
objectives I set myself when I became chancellor.
My first priority has been to sustain the economic recovery now underway and
to create the right climate for growth and jobs.
I have been determined to take no risks with inflation.
We have brought inflation down to the lowest level for a generation and low
inflation must now remain a permanent feature of the British economic
landscape.
To achieve these objectives, the task of my first Budget has been to set the
government's finances on a sustainable path for the rest of the decade. To
make the decisions necessary now to secure lasting recovery and rising
living standards in the future.
The Financial Statement and Budget Report, together with a number of press
releases filling out the details of our spending plans and my Budget tax
proposals, will be available from the Vote Office as soon as I have sat
down.
Economic situation and prospects
Mr Deputy Speaker, Britain's economic performance this year has been
encouraging.
It is now clear that the recovery started in the first half of 1992, well
before sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. GDP has risen
for six successive quarters. And in 1993 as a whole, I now expect the
economy to grow by about 1 3/4 per cent.
Unemployment has fallen since the beginning of the year, at a much earlier
stage in the economic cycle than past experience would suggest.
And crucially, the recovery has been accompanied by continuing low
inflation. Underlying inflation has not been lower since 1968. And unit wage
costs in manufacturing have actually fallen this year, allowing British
industry to establish a durable improvement in competitiveness.
As a result, despite the weakness of activity in the other major European
countries, Britain's trading performance over the last year has been
excellent. Exports to countries outside the EU were up by no less than 14
per cent in the last three months compared with a year ago  - a sharp
increase in our market share. After the last three difficult years, that
performance convincingly demonstrates the strength of British manufacturing
today.
Continued growth in consumer spending, together with further increases in
exports and investment, should bring faster growth in 1994.
Economic forecasting is an unreliable art, to which far too much importance
has been attached in recent years. But on the best judgement I can make,
growth next year should be about 2 1/2 per cent.
With considerable spare capacity in the economy, inflationary pressures
remain subdued. The tax measures announced in March, and the further
measures I shall be announcing today, will push inflation up a little in the
next few months.
But this should not feed through into higher inflation over the medium term.
I expect underlying inflation to remain inside the government's 1 to 4 per
cent target range over the year ahead, and to decline steadily into the
lower half of that range by the end of this parliament. Monetary policy will
continue to be directed towards meeting that objective.
Monetary policy
As now, my decisions on interest rates will be based on a careful assessment
of monetary conditions and inflationary trends, focusing particularly upon
the growth of narrow and broad money, changes in the exchange rate and
movements in asset prices.
On the basis of these indicators, I felt able last week to reduce interest
rates to 5 1/2 per cent, the lowest level for 16 years. Since 1990,
industry's interest bill has been slashed by nearly Pounds 12bn a year, and
the typical mortgage borrower is paying Pounds 170 less each month.
That is a massive boost to spending power, fully justified by the remarkable
progress we have made on inflation.
Starting with last week's change, I decided to give the Bank of England
responsibility for the precise timing of interest rate movements. This
underlines my commitment to the new framework for monetary policy
established by my predecessor last September.
Funding policy
Mr Deputy Speaker, the increasing credibility of that framework has brought
our long-term interest rates down to their lowest level for over 25 years.
That fact also demonstrates the ease with which this year's borrowing
requirement has been financed. But the very success of the funding
programme, coupled with last year's substantial gilt sales to banks and
building societies, has squeezed the liquidity of the banking system,
complicating the task of managing the money markets.
To offset the purchases made by banks and building societies last year, I
intend to sell some Pounds 7bn fewer gilts than would otherwise be necessary
to fund the public sector borrowing requirement through to the end of
1994-95.
Using this flexibility in our established funding policy will ease money
market pressures, while continuing to ensure that borrowing is financed in a
non-inflationary way.
World economic developments
As we look towards 1994 the prospects are encouraging.
But two substantial risks remain.
First, the continuing weakness of world economic activity, particularly in
continental Europe.
With Britain the only major country in the European Union likely to have
grown at all in 1993, what manufacturing industry needs most is a pick-up of
activity in the rest of Europe.
But economic recovery on the continent will not be enough on its own.
Europe's economic problems are not just cyclical. The continent as a whole
faces a number of deep-rooted and long-standing challenges - inflexible
markets and declining competitiveness, which have combined to produce
mounting structural unemployment.
There were more jobs created in Britain in the 1980s than anywhere else in
Europe. And in the period ahead, we must not only fight to export our goods
and services, but also to win the battle of ideas in Europe. We must
continue to work for more flexible and deregulated labour markets across the
continent. And we must continue to fight for free trade, not just within the
European Union, but between the Union and the rest of the world. The first
essential step is to secure a satisfactory conclusion to the Gatt round.
The public finances
The second major risk to the recovery in Britain is the public finances. The
overriding need is to place the public finances on a sound footing. That is
the immediate task of the government and the main theme of my Budget today.
Business can plan ahead with confidence only if it knows that government
borrowing is under control. My task today is to deliver that confidence.
In his excellent Budget in March, my Rt Hon Friend the member for Kingston
announced a series of tax measures designed to reduce public sector
borrowing over the medium term.
But necessary and controversial as those measures were, they still left the
prospect of a borrowing requirement of over 4 per cent of GDP by the end of
this parliament.
In my judgment, we now need to go further. The first Budget that combines
decisions on taxation and spending, a reform instituted by my Rt Hon Friend,
gives me the opportunity to do so.
As a prudent government, we cannot sit by, simply hoping that faster growth
and forecasting changes will come to our rescue.
As a government committed to high quality public services, we must prevent
ever larger sums being swallowed up in debt interest payments.
As a government with a long-term tax-cutting agenda, we must stop ever more
national debt piling up for future generations to pay.
And as a government determined to deliver sustained recovery, we must ensure
that billions of pounds of the nation's savings are not poured into the
public sector - savings that are better used by the private sector, to
support investment, expansion and jobs.
It might seem easier to take the short-term view.
But Britain's recovery can only be sustained if we tackle the deficit now.
In my opinion, the Budget must sort out the problem of public borrowing once
and for all.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the measures I am announcing today will in themselves
reduce the public sector borrowing requirement by a further Pounds 5 1/2 bn
in the next financial year, by Pounds 7bn in 1995-96 and by Pounds 10 1/2 bn
in 1996-97, equivalent to 1 1/4 per cent of GDP by the end of this
parliament.
Coming on top of the measures announced by my Rt Hon Friend in March, these
are substantial sums. But in my judgment, this is the minimum necessary to
ensure that the public finances are on a sustainable track for the rest of
the decade. It will help to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement
from just under Pounds 50bn in the current year to about Pounds 38bn next
year. It should eliminate borrowing to finance current spending by 1997-98
and eliminate government borrowing entirely by the end of the decade.
In short, Mr Deputy Speaker, my proposals today should meet their objectives
in full - establishing sound public finances into the next century.
VAT on fuel and power
Before I set out the government's new plans for public expenditure over the
next three years, I have one piece of business to conclude from the March
Budget.
My Rt Hon Friend's decision to extend VAT to domestic fuel and power was in
my view fully justified and I have no intention of asking parliament to
change the measure which it has already voted in favour of and put on the
statute book.
To reduce borrowing, we had to raise revenue. In a full year, VAT on
domestic fuel will raise nearly Pounds 3bn, without affecting the
job-creating sectors of the economy. It will also help to meet Britain's
commitment to aim to return carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 levels by
the end of this decade.
But the government recognised from the outset that the poorest would need
extra help. I can now announce to the House our detailed proposals.
First, even before the extra help we intend to provide, all those on
income-related benefits will get a substantial increase next April under the
normal uprating rules. Benefits will rise by 3 1/2 per cent - a lot more
than many people in work will get next year.
But on top of that automatic increase, the government has decided to provide
further substantial help.
For poorer households other than pensioners and the disabled, we will
calculate the benefit increases that would be paid at the April 1995
uprating from VAT on fuel, and pay them a year early - this coming April.
This will ensure that extra help is available before the bills arrive.
In April 1995, we will adopt a similar approach, bringing forward the VAT
element in the benefit uprating once more.
And in April 1996, this extra payment will remain as a permanent addition to
benefit.
For poorer pensioners and disabled people on income-related benefits, we
intend to go further. Next April, we will give a special increase on top of
the normal uprating: 50 pence a week for single people and 70 pence a week
for couples. In April 1995, this will be doubled to Pounds 1 a week for
single people and Pounds 1.40 a week for couples, partly through the normal
uprating and partly through a further special increase. And by April 1996,
benefits will be Pounds 1.40 a week higher for single poorer pensioners and
Pounds 2 a week higher for couples than they would otherwise have been.
The immediate impact next April will be to give a pensioner couple on income
support a total increase in benefit of Pounds 4 per week.
Cold weather payments will also be increased, to help the most vulnerable
groups during periods of exceptionally cold weather. Next winter these
payments will go up from Pounds 6 to Pounds 7 a week; and there will be a
further increase to Pounds 7.50 a week from November 1995.
This, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a substantial package of help, which fully
discharges the promise we have made.
It will ensure that the introduction of VAT does not put the cost of fuel
beyond the reach of the poorest in our society.
That promise was, of course, restricted to people on means-tested benefits,
benefits which exist precisely in order to help those in the greatest need.
But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do recognise that there is another group who have
struggled to cope over recent years and will also have difficulty in meeting
their higher fuel bills.
Many retired people on modest incomes have worked hard all their lives and
have been careful to put something aside each week. Often these savings mean
that they cannot claim benefit. Yet while millions of families and
businesses have benefited from falling interest rates over the last three
years, many of these people feel that they have lost out again. Falling
inflation helps to preserve the real value of their savings, but the
interest retired people receive on their savings has dropped very sharply.
The government has therefore decided to give extra help not just to those on
modest incomes, but to all pensioners.
We will do so in three ways.
First, my Rt Hon Friend the secretary of state for the environment has
decided to boost the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme by Pounds 35m a year over
the next three years. An equivalent extension will be made in Northern
Ireland. This will provide substantial financial assistance with home
insulation, helping people to reduce their fuel bills whilst staying warm.
By almost doubling the present provision, we will be able to extend
eligibility to all pensioners and all disabled people.
Second, I shall help savers and particularly those whose incomes are made
unpredictable by changes in interest rates. I intend to introduce a new
pensioner's guaranteed income bond which will combine a fixed rate of
interest, guaranteed for five years, with regular monthly interest payments.
Full details will be announced in the new year, but I can tell the House now
that the rate will be a competitive one. Pensioners will be able to invest
their savings, with complete security, and know exactly what income they
will be getting - month in, month out.
Third, and most significant, I intend to make a special addition to pensions
 -and to the benefits linked to them - over and above the normal uprating in
line with the retail prices index. Over the next two years I propose to give
to all pensioners exactly the same extra help with their fuel bills as those
pensioners on income-related benefits will be getting.
This extra help will build up over time. By April 1996, the weekly
retirement pension for a pensioner couple will be Pounds 1.85 a week higher
than it would otherwise have been without the VAT increase. A single
pensioner will receive Pounds 1.30 a week more.
The help I have outlined for pensioners will not precisely match increases
in fuel bills in each and every household.
But on average, pensioners are likely to find that, after taking account of
falling real fuel prices, the extra help they receive will broadly cover
changes in fuel bills, including VAT, over the course of this Parliament.
This is the first break since 1980 from our policy of uprating pensions
strictly by the retail prices index.
It must be regarded as wholly exceptional and it cannot be repeated whenever
a particular tax or price increase is opposed on the grounds that retired
people should not pay it.
In a very difficult year for public spending, this amounts to a huge package
of extra help. Fifteen million people will benefit. We shall be providing
around Pounds 400m of extra help next year, and around Pounds 1 1/4 bn extra
in the year 1996-97. These massive sums more than deliver the government's
firm commitment to help the less well-off groups in society.
They extend that significant help to all our pensioners.
I am sure they will be welcomed by everyone who wants to see revenue raised
in a sensible and fair way.
Public spending
Mr Deputy Speaker, let me now turn to the government's new spending plans
for the rest of this parliament.
In June, the cabinet imposed tight ceilings on public spending over the next
three years - a real terms freeze in the new control total over the next two
years, with growth limited to 1 per cent a year thereafter. In my view,
nothing tougher has been attempted since this government came to power in
1979.
Anyone who has actually run one or more of the big departments of state
knows how unacceptable it would be to contemplate cuts in the health
service, in our education system, or in the resources needed to improve law
and order.
In a modern and civilised society no one can regard all public spending as a
bad thing.
Of course, more spending is not the only way to improve our public services.
Quality public services also depend crucially on greater efficiency, better
value for money, and where sensible, on the involvement of private sector
money, management and advice.
Earlier this year, my Rt Hon Friend the chief secretary launched a series of
fundamental public expenditure reviews to establish more clearly what the
government's spending priorities should be. Already this programme is
producing dividends. The first four reviews have played a key role in this
year's public expenditure survey.
I can now announce to the House that overall, even including the package of
help with fuel bills, the government's new spending plans are fully
consistent with the tough limits agreed by the cabinet in June.
For the next three years, total government expenditure will grow by
substantially less than the projected growth of the economy. Public spending
will therefore fall as a proportion of national income, from around 45 per
cent this year to 42 1/2 per cent in 1996-97.
To achieve this, we have started with a rigorous approach to the
government's administrative costs. Central government running costs,
including paybills, will be frozen at this year's cash level. Pay increases
for public sector staff will therefore have to be paid for by greater
efficiency or savings in the cost of running government.
But, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have also had to conduct a searching examination
of spending on government programmes. That examination began with the
largest spending programme of all, social security.
Social security
Social security spending is increasing at an underlying rate of more than 3
per cent a year in real terms, well above the sustainable growth rate of the
economy as a whole. If this trend continues it will place a quite impossible
burden on the working population in the future - our children and our
children's children.
If we do not plan the social security programme properly, we shall be unable
to give effective help to those who need it most.
A good social security system - under which the better off and people in
work pay to support the poor and the disadvantaged - is an essential feature
of a modern civilised state.
In reviewing the social security budget, the government's objectives have
been to ensure that the social security system is better targeted on today's
real needs and to make it simpler and less susceptible to fraud.
Job seeker's allowance
Let me start, Mr Deputy Speaker, with two proposals designed to help people
back into work. The present convoluted system for supporting the unemployed
includes two entirely separate benefits - income support and unemployment
benefit - and two quite separate bureaucracies for delivering them - the
Employment Service and the Benefits Agency, employing between them no fewer
than 44,000 civil servants to do the job.
We intend to cut through this bureaucratic maze by introducing, from April
1996, a single benefit for the unemployed - the job seeker's allowance. This
will align rates and rules and reduce the contributory element of the
benefit from 12 to 6 months. But it will also build on the success of the
Restart programme introduced in the 1980s, by drawing a much closer link
between the receipt of benefit and the claimant's demonstrated willingness
to look for work. And it will be reinforced by a strengthening of Restart
itself; by an extension of community action places; and by the introduction
of pilot schemes offering intensive guidance, assessment and a financial
incentive to long-term unemployed people who need it most.
Family credit
Our second proposal should have a more immediate impact.
The House will be aware of the rising level of concern about the causes,
consequences and costs of the growth of lone parenthood in this country.
There are many lone parents - and married mothers as well - who have no
desire to remain trapped in poverty or dependent on benefits, but who
believe that they have no choice. As a result of the cost of childcare, they
simply cannot afford to go out to work.
That cannot be right. The government has therefore decided to introduce next
autumn a new allowance available to all those on family credit who need to
pay for childcare.
This will be worth up to Pounds 28 each week per family and it should help
tens of thousands of mothers to get back into work and off income support. I
am sure it will be warmly welcomed by all those who want to see the poorest
parents back on the road to financial independence.
I turn next to statutory sick pay.
At the moment, employees who go sick and meet the qualifying conditions are
entitled to receive sick pay at specified rates. After the first three days
of sickness, their employers are entitled to reimbursement from the
government for 80 per cent of the cost.
We have no plans to reduce the sick pay entitlements of employees. But, with
effect from next April, we propose to stop reimbursing the cost of statutory
sick pay for the largest employers.
For smaller companies, the current special exemptions will be extended. At
present, those with national insurance bills of less than Pounds 16,000 a
year are fully reimbursed after the first six weeks of each statutory sick
pay claim. I propose to increase that threshold to Pounds 20,000, to bring
more companies into the scheme, and to provide full reimbursement after only
four weeks. Two thirds of all employers will therefore continue to get help.
Employers' national
insurance contributions
The transfer of these costs from the taxpayer to business will reduce public
spending by around Pounds 700m a year over the next three years. But to
ensure that business as a whole does not lose, my Rt Hon Friend and I have
decided to reduce the main rate of employers' national insurance
contributions by 0.2 per cent from next April. This means that for
well-managed companies with low sickness rates there will be a net reduction
in the cost of employing people. Other companies will have a much sharper
incentive to improve their management of sick leave and to take a greater
interest in the health of their employees.
But with unemployment in Britain still far too high, it is vital that we do
everything we can to reduce the cost of providing employment. Having
reviewed the position, I have therefore decided that, even in a year of
acute fiscal stringency, we can and should go further.
Long-term unemployed people are most likely to find unskilled and
semi-skilled work at the lower end of the pay scale. To improve companies'
incentives and ability to provide that kind of job, I propose, again from
next April, to reduce each of the lower rates of employers' national
insurance contributions by one full percentage point. Overall, the
reductions in national insurance contributions I have announced will reduce
the cost to employers of providing jobs by Pounds 830m next year, rising to
Pounds 1bn by 1996-97, well above the overall cost to employers of the
reform to statutory sick pay.
In our discussions within the European Union, my Rt Hon Friend the prime
minister and I have repeatedly made clear our view that the surest route to
higher employment is not the dirigisme of the Social Chapter, but measures
to reduce the cost of creating jobs. This is the message we will be taking
with us to the European Council in Brussels next week. My Rt Hon Friend the
secretary of state for social security also plans a significant reform of
the current regime for invalidity benefit. For those who are disabled and
incapable of work, invalidity benefit is important and necessary. But the
astonishing growth in the numbers receiving the benefit in recent years
indicates that it is now being claimed by many people who are not genuine
invalids.
The government has decided to make a number of changes to the benefit, which
will refocus it for the future on those who are genuinely incapable of work.
My Rt Hon Friend proposes to introduce a new benefit  - incapacity benefit -
to replace sickness and invalidity benefit. The new benefit will involve a
tighter and more objective medical test.
The government has always made clear its intention to bring the tax
treatment of invalidity benefit into line with that of the retirement
pension and most other income-replacing benefits. Now that the necessary
administrative arrangements can be made, I propose from April 1995 to bring
its replacement, the new incapacity benefit, into tax.
State pension age
Finally, I can announce one further decision which will have little
immediate effect, but will make a considerable difference to the
affordability of the modern welfare state in the next century.
After careful consideration, the government has decided that the state
pension age should eventually be equalised at 65. The change will be phased
in over 10 years, starting in the year 2010, so it will not affect anyone
currently aged 44 or older. By the year 2020, the state pension age in
Britain will be broadly in line with that of most of our industrial
competitors, though we will still have more generous arrangements than in
the US, where the pension age is to be equalised at 67. All developed
countries are making similar changes for similar reasons. Women nowadays
tend to spend more of their lives in paid employment. They also live longer
than men. Pension schemes need to recognise this, and end the current
discrimination between the sexes.
In the next century the ratio of working people to retired people will fall
sharply and the burdens on taxpayers will rise. The government's decision
will moderate those burdens, eventually by some Pounds 5bn a year, and so
help to ensure that they are sustainable. The basic pension is, and will
remain, a cornerstone of the welfare state. The government is committed to
it and to retaining its value.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the proposals I have announced today will in themselves
save some Pounds 2 1/2 bn a year by 1996-97. Nevertheless, even taking these
savings into account, we will still be spending Pounds 5bn more on social
security in that year than we planned last year. The social security budget
will continue to grow in real terms, but at a more affordable rate than we
have seen in recent years.
At the same time, we have honoured our manifesto commitments, we have fully
protected the real value of pensions and benefits, and provided generous
help with fuel bills.
These are not short-term measures to deal with today's problems. This
government has the courage to take a clear and far-sighted view of the
modern social security system.
We must make sure that it is a system that future generations will be able
to afford. This government will never take part in any attempt to dismantle
the welfare state. We want to see a better welfare state, well-run,
well-judged and one that meets the priorities of modern society.
My Rt Hon Friend the secretary of state for social security will fill out
the details in his uprating statement tomorrow.
Mr Deputy Speaker, let me turn now to a number of other areas where savings
have been found this year.
Local authorities
First, local authorities. Growth in total standard spending in England,
adjusted for changes in responsibilities, will be limited to 2.3 per cent
next year. There will, in addition, be extra provision for community care.
The government will continue to use its powers to cap excessive spending by
local authorities where that is necessary to protect the local taxpayer.
Housing
Second, housing. Here too savings have been made on last year's plans.
Nevertheless, the new plans for social housing provide for more than 153,000
new homes over the three years to 1994-95, fully meeting our manifesto
commitment. In addition, the government will press ahead with plans to
improve value for money in the housing association sector and to introduce
more private finance into the development of social housing.
Transport
Third, transport. British Rail's and London Transport's investment
programmes will be maintained at levels substantially higher than in the
1980s.
But to make room for this continuing investment in public transport there
will be modest reductions in the previous planned provision for the roads
programme. In the past five years, real expenditure on roads has grown on
average by more than 10 per cent a year. With construction prices next year
more than 25 per cent lower than when the roads programme was announced in
1989, the new plans will sustain the recent improvements in our roads
network - at less cost to the taxpayer.
Defence
Finally, defence. In the next two years, spending will be some Pounds 250m
and Pounds 500m lower than previously planned. In 1996-97, it will be about
the same in cash terms as in the previous year.
The new plans will be delivered in part by lower procurement and employment
costs, and through the planned sale to a private sector housing trust of
married quarters for service personnel. In addition, my Rt Hon Friend the
defence secretary has set in hand a major review of all aspects of support,
right back to the headquarters in Whitehall. Savings can and will be made
without affecting our foreign policy commitments.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the new method of controlling the total of public
spending has brought big improvements in the system of cabinet government.
The cabinet decides its priorities collectively and brings to the House a
single package that reflects our key policy objectives. Savings identified
in a number of programmes have allowed the government to meet in full the
priorities and promises set out in our manifesto. I turn now to those
priorities.
Health
We are all proud of the contribution that the National Health Service makes
to the quality of life in this country. Even in a very tough year, we have
decided to increase once again the level of real resources going into the
health service. NHS spending will be over Pounds 1 1/2 bn higher next year
in cash terms and over 1 1/2 per cent higher in real terms than this year's
plans. Indeed, the programme is set to rise in real terms in each of the
next three years.
To ensure that these very substantial extra resources are translated into
more and better health care, my Rt Hon Friend the secretary of state for
health will be insisting on substantial increases in efficiency and firm
containment of pay and the drugs budget. The NHS will be able to maintain
the steady improvement of recent years in treating more patients, better.
Education
Second, education. Increased educational opportunities and better standards
are an essential investment in the future. Over the next two years, we will
therefore be adding more than Pounds 1bn to the plans for the education
programme. This will ensure record levels of participation in further and
higher education. Our manifesto predicted that one in three young people
would be in full-time higher education by the year 2000. With seven years to
go we have virtually reached that target already.
But with a third of our young people now going to university, the ordinary
taxpayer cannot be expected to pay for all their costs. Tuition is free; but
why should the bus driver or the pensioner also pay higher taxes to finance
the living costs of tomorrow's lawyers?
I am glad to say that the recent explosion in student numbers has revealed
as ridiculous the fears that the student loan scheme might deter students
from poorer families. My Rt Hon Friend will therefore be bringing forward
proposals to reduce the level of the means-tested grant for student
maintenance and replace it with an expanded loan entitlement for students.
Even taking this into account, spending on education will still be no less
than Pounds 1 1/2 bn higher in 1996-97 than this year.
Employment and training
Third, training. the secretary of state for employment plans to introduce a
new apprenticeship scheme. This will provide a significant boost to
work-based training and increase substantially the number of young people
obtaining the technical and craft skills which the economy has been lacking,
as both employers and trades unions agree. There will also be an increase in
training opportunities for the adult unemployed.
Science
Fourth, science. The plans fully protect the real value of spending on basic
science and technology next year.
Finally, the vital area of criminal justice. Previous plans for home office
spending will be maintained in full. Next year, spending on the police
service will increase by more than 4 per cent. And, over time, the
management reforms and reduction in paperwork announced by my Rt Hon and
Learned Friend the home secretary, could put over 5,000 more police officers
on front-line duty. A re-ordering of priorities will also allow for extra
provision to be made for more prison places and for victim support.
Efficiency improvements will meet in full the costs of new policies,
including our proposals to deal with juvenile offenders.
Mr Deputy Speaker, spending on health, education, training and science
contributes significantly to the long-term economic performance of the
economy, by improving the nation's stock of human capital - the health,
knowledge and skills of the population as a whole.
Important as it is, this contribution is very difficult to quantify. This
year, however, as promised last autumn, the public sector accounts will
identify separately the amount the government plans to spend on physical
capital projects, including improvements in the nation's infrastructure.
Overall, the new plans provide for total public sector capital spending over
the next three years of about Pounds 22bn a year. But just as that figure
takes no account of the massive investment programmes of the former
nationalised industries which are now thriving in the private sector, so too
it ignores the very large amount of investment which is stimulated by
government policies, including investment in housing and urban regeneration.
On top of this, the private finance initiative is adding to spending in
areas for which the public sector has traditionally taken responsibility.
To make a success of this initiative - and to deliver the increase in
capital spending within the public services that I want to see - will
require a complete change of culture within government, together with
imagination and innovation on the part of the private sector. This cannot be
expected to happen overnight. Even so, the flow of private finance projects
to date has still, in my view, been disappointingly small.
To speed the process up, I have already announced the establishment of a
working group chaired by Sir Alastair Morton, who I am sure can be expected
to work alongside me as a veritable warrior in this cause. In the meantime
the government is today giving the go-ahead to three substantial new
transport projects.
First, the extension of the Docklands Light Railway to Lewisham. Second, a
new air traffic control centre for Scotland. Third, the refurbishment of the
west coast main line, one of our most important routes, linking some of the
biggest cities in the country - London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool
and Glasgow.
The private finance initiative also offers great opportunities for improved
services in the NHS. There are almost 40 NHS projects where private finance
is already involved or being considered, ranging from cardiac units to
hospital car parks.
At Aintree, in Liverpool, a scheme involving the construction of a 100-bed
patient hotel, four operating theatres and other facilities is going ahead -
a model for other private finance projects.
In addition, my Rt Hon and Learned Friend the home secretary will be taking
forward proposals to finance and build six new prisons using private
finance. He has already announced that he also intends to involve the
private sector in the provision of secure training centres.
Finally, I have always made clear my view that roads provide a big
opportunity for private finance. My Rt Hon Friend the secretary of state for
transport will be informing the House shortly about the government's plans
for taking forward motorway charging in the light of responses to his Green
Paper. But I can announce today that when the technology is ready, we intend
to introduce a system of electronic motorway charging in this country. This
will be a massive high-technology project in its own right. In the meantime,
the government plans to introduce new contracts under which the private
sector will design, build, finance and operate roads. My Rt Hon Friend will
hold discussions with the construction industry and others to identify the
best road schemes to start with. Bringing private finance and management
into the roads programme offers the prospect of substantial benefits for the
construction industry, the motorist and the taxpayer alike. I am sure this
will be warmly welcomed.
I have one other announcement to make to improve the way the taxpayer's
money and public sector capital is used and accounted for.
Government accounting for public spending has become archaic. In my view,
the time has come to move to a system of accounting which identifies more
clearly the cost of resources. This will put departments onto a similar
accounting basis to commercial organisations and many other parts of the
public sector. I shall be publishing a paper in the first half of next year
on the introduction of accruals-based resource accounting by departments,
and its implications for the way expenditure is planned and controlled and
money is sought from Parliament.
Public spending summary
Mr Deputy Speaker, the new spending plans reflect the carefully chosen
priorities of an enlightened and responsible government.
We have taken strong measures to keep public sector pay and administration
costs under tight control.
We have taken a number of crucial steps to restrain the growth in social
security spending, while fully meeting our commitments to the poorest
members of society.
We have increased resources to support the government's priorities,
particularly health, education and training and science.
We have protected spending on law and order.
We have injected new momentum into the private finance initiative.
And we have honoured all our manifesto commitments.
But most important of all, we have managed this substantial re-allocation of
resources without breaching the spending ceilings agreed by cabinet last
June.
This significant achievement owes a great deal to the new arrangements for
the public expenditure survey introduced last year by my Rt Hon Friend, the
member for Kingston. But a great deal of credit is also due to my colleagues
on the cabinet's EDX committee, and particularly to my Rt Hon Friend the
chief secretary, to whose skill and tenacity I should like to pay the
warmest possible tribute.
Taxation
Mr Deputy Speaker, I now turn to my proposals for taxation. My task is
simple. I need to raise revenue, but to do so in a way which does least
damage to the economy. At a time when taxes are having to go up, it is
particularly important to collect all the tax which is properly due. So let
me begin with my proposals to counter tax avoidance.
Suggesting that Budgets should close tax loopholes is stating the obvious.
Every Budget over the past 14 years has closed tax loopholes. This is not a
big new idea. The tax avoidance industry is always ingenious, but it is one
industry which this government has never helped.
My Budget today contains a particularly good crop of new proposals to combat
tax avoidance, starting with an end to the ploy under which salaries are
paid in gold bars, coffee beans, cowrie shells, or other exotic payments in
kind, simply to avoid national insurance contributions and delay paying tax.
I also intend to counter the abuse of the tax relief for profit related pay;
tackle the avoidance of stamp duty on property transactions; halt the use of
shell companies to avoid payment of tax; and end the use of indexation to
create or increase capital gains tax losses.
These measures will yield about Pounds 2bn in the next three years. Claims
that more might be found in this way are, I regret to say, much exaggerated.
Next, I propose to broaden the tax base. I have never disguised my personal
view that the coverage of Value Added Tax in this country is too narrow.
Under the EC's Sixth VAT Directive there are serious limits on the
Government's ability to extend it to things which are exempt. But we do have
the freedom to introduce separate taxes, and that is what other European
countries do. I propose to follow their example - in two particular areas,
which I believe are well-suited to this country.
Air passenger duty
First, air travel is under-taxed compared to other sectors of the economy.
It benefits not only from a zero rate of VAT; in addition, the fuel used in
international air travel, and nearly all domestic flights, is entirely free
of tax. A number of countries have already addressed this anomaly.
I propose to levy a small duty on all air passengers from UK airports. This
will be set at Pounds 5 for departures to anywhere in the UK and the
European Union; and Pounds 10 for departures to other destinations. The new
duty will come into force next October, and will raise some Pounds 330
million in a full year.
There will be exemptions for transfer passengers and small planes. This
means, for example, that most flights between the Scottish islands will not
bear tax.
Insurance premium tax
Second, we have always tended to tax financial services in this country much
more lightly than other sectors, including manufacturing. In this Budget, I
have decided to tackle one sector of this industry which is exempt from VAT.
Virtually every other member state charges an ad valorem tax on insurance
premiums. I propose now to do the same.
The rate will be 3 per cent, among the lowest in Europe, and the tax will
apply to most general insurance of risks located in the United Kingdom. It
will come into force next October, and will raise over Pounds 750m in a full
year.
To avoid driving business offshore, I propose to exempt the re-insurance of
risk, and the insurance of most ships, aircraft and international transit
goods.
To avoid taxing exports, I propose to exempt export credit. And to avoid
taxing savings, I shall exempt long-term insurance such as life assurance,
including assurance for endowment mortgages.
For the typical family with motor, home contents and building insurance,
this tax will cost about 35 pence a week.
Income tax
Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall return later in my statement to the existing
indirect taxes, and particularly to VAT.
But before I do, let me set out my proposals for direct taxation.
First, I propose to freeze again the personal allowance for income tax, the
threshold for higher rate tax and the income limit for the age-related
allowances. I do not propose to change the inheritance tax threshold or the
exempt amount for capital gains tax; or the lower, basic or higher rates of
income tax. The 20 pence lower band will be extended by a further Pounds 500
next year as planned, to Pounds 3,000.
I intend to raise one allowance which has been frozen for the last four
years - the blind person's allowance.
This will rise next April from Pounds 1,080 to Pounds 1,200.
These proposals will yield Pounds 550 million in 1994-95, relative to an
indexed base, rising to Pounds 720 million in 1995-96.
Married couple's allowance
Now that husbands and wives are taxed independently, the married couple's
allowance is a bit of an anomaly. As announced in March, from next April it
will be limited to 20 per cent. Given the need to raise extra revenue, I
propose to reduce the rate of relief further, to 15 per cent from April
1995.
This will yield Pounds 830m in 1995-96, rising to over Pounds 1bn in a full
year.
Mortgage interest relief
I propose to take a similar approach to mortgage interest relief. As the
House is aware, the rate of mortgage interest relief will fall from 25 to 20
per cent in April. From April 1995, I propose to reduce it further, to 15
per cent, raising an additional Pounds 950m in 1995-96. For those with
mortgages of Pounds 30,000 or more, this will cost around Pounds 10 a month.
This is a tiny fraction of the benefit borrowers are still receiving from
the very substantial reduction in mortgage rates in the last three years.
The limit on loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief will remain at
Pounds 30,000.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the tax increases I have announced will enable me to give
some modest help to businesses.
Corporation tax
There will be no change to the main rate of corporation tax, which remains
the lowest in the European Union, or to the small companies' rate. But I
propose to raise the profits limit for smaller companies by 20 per cent.
This will reduce corporation tax bills for 30,000 companies.
Foreign income dividend scheme
To help reinforce Britain's place as Europe's most attractive location for
international business, I shall implement proposals to make surplus advance
corporation tax repayable on dividends paid out of profits earned abroad by
companies based in the United Kingdom.
Export credit
For exporters, I propose to make an extra Pounds 200m of export credit cover
available in 1996-97, and to cut export credit premiums for certain
important developing markets, including India, Mexico and Turkey. British
exporters of capital goods have been very successful in winning orders over
the last year, particularly outside Europe. The President of the Board of
Trade and I want to see that continue.
Uniform business rates
The business rates poundage increase next year, based on the 1.8 per cent
September retail prices index, will be the lowest since introduction of the
uniform business rate. For properties in England and Wales still protected
by transitional relief, I propose to cut the maximum real increase in rate
bills next year by a half, to 10 per cent for larger properties and 7 1/2
per cent for smaller properties.
Small properties which are used for both domestic and business purposes  -
the shop where the owner lives at the back - will face no real increase at
all. Separate arrangements will be made in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
This will bring significant relief next year to over 600,000 business
properties throughout the UK. It will cost a little over Pounds 100m next
year.
Small businesses
But my particular priority this year has been to help small businesses. In
my opinion, the biggest contribution any Chancellor can make to reducing
unemployment over the medium term is to ensure that the conditions are in
place for new businesses to become established and for small businesses to
grow. As a country, we generate plenty of budding entrepreneurs and any
number of good inventions and ideas. Yet all too often those ideas stay on
the drawing board as money is channelled instead into the safer larger
companies.
My proposals seek to address three separate problems facing small businesses
today: the burden of regulation;
the shortage of external finance; and cashflow.
Deregulation
I can announce today four contributions to the Prime Minister's campaign to
turn the tide of excessive regulation which threatens to engulf our smaller
firms.
First, the Finance Bill will include the initial tranche of legislation to
implement the plans announced in March to reform the current regime for
assessing personal tax.
The new system will be simpler and more efficient. The changes will be of
particular benefit to the self-employed.
Second, the Secretary of State for Social Security published last month the
report of the Working Group set up to consider the options for aligning
income tax and national insurance contributions. My Rt Hon Friend and I
agree with the Group's conclusion that there are significant savings to be
had from using the same definitions, same paperwork and same audits for
income tax and national insurance. We are now looking at the Group's main
recommendations and will be bringing forward proposals early next year.
VAT threshold
Third, VAT. Firms are currently required to register for VAT when their
turnover reaches Pounds 37,600 a year. I intend to raise this to Pounds
45,000 with effect from tomorrow. This will allow up to 75,000 more traders
to opt out of VAT altogether.
Finally, the statutory audit. The Companies Act requires all companies to
have their accounts audited. But for the smallest companies the expense can
be out of all proportion to the benefit.
When I was at the Department of Trade and Industry I continually pressed for
a change to this. My predecessor announced consultation in the March Budget.
I can now announce the conclusions.
The President of the Board of Trade and I have decided that most companies
with a turnover between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 350,000 a year in future
need only get an independent accountant's report on whether the company's
accounts correctly reflect its books.
But for the 40 per cent of companies with turnover of less than Pounds
90,000, we propose to take the deregulation a step further. For these small
companies, the audit requirement will be abolished altogether.
But I don't just want to lighten the burden of regulation. I believe that
positive steps are required to increase the flow of risk capital into small
businesses.
Capital gains tax
For managers and employees to leave steady jobs and take a chance by going
into business on their own, the risk must be worthwhile. At 40 per cent, our
top rate of income tax is the lowest in the European Union, and I intend to
keep it that way. But our capital gains tax regime still bears
disproportionately on the successful entrepreneur.
In 1991, we increased the capital gains tax relief for business people who
sell up on retirement, by providing a complete exemption from capital gains
tax on the first Pounds 150,000 of capital gains and a half exemption on the
next Pounds 450,000. I now propose to increase these limits to Pounds
250,000 and Pounds 750,000 respectively.
By rewarding those who have been successful in the past, this measure will
encourage potential entrepreneurs in the future.
In addition, I propose that any individual facing a capital gains charge
should be able to defer the tax indefinitely by reinvesting those gains in
an unquoted trading company.
I also intend to create a new type of investment, a venture capital trust,
which will channel savings specifically into unquoted trading companies.
Investors will receive dividends and capital gains entirely free of tax. And
by investing through a trust they will also be able to spread their risk
across a number of different companies.
The Financial Secretary will shortly be issuing a consultation paper
fleshing out the details.
Enterprise investment scheme
In my view, there remains, too, a strong case for encouraging direct equity
investment in unquoted trading companies.
I propose to introduce a new scheme, the enterprise investment scheme, to do
just that. The enterprise investment scheme will differ from the old
business expansion scheme in several important respects.
To target the money where we want it to go, property-related investments
will be excluded. Up-front tax relief will be limited to 20 per cent. But
any losses on investments will qualify for income tax and capital gains tax
relief;
and all capital gains within the scheme will be entirely free of capital
gains tax. The limit for investors will be Pounds 100,000 a year.
Most important of all, to help those who are looking to invest their
expertise as well as their money, people previously unconnected with the
companies they invest in will be able to take up paid directorships.
The cost of the new scheme could eventually rise to some Pounds 50m a year.
Taken together with my proposals on capital gains tax and the new venture
capital trust, I believe it could generate substantial new investment in the
unquoted company sector.
Late payment
Finally, I turn to the problem of small companies' cashflow. There is one
issue, which year after year tops the list of Budget representations made to
all of us by the small business community - the problem of late payment.
There can be nothing more frustrating than delivering a quality product on
time at a competitive price and then finding that you don't get paid for
months. Late payments wreak havoc with cashflow, and for many small firms
they can make the difference between survival and failure.
The habit of late payment is corroding our business culture. I am quite sure
that it needs to be dealt with.
There are many options for tackling this, and my RHF the President of the
Board of Trade and I will be looking at two in particular: first, a new
British Standard for payment performance; and second - more significant -
legislation to provide for interest on late payments. Late payment was a
serious problem for small businesses throughout the last recession. I
believe the time has now come to take this issue head on.
Indirect taxation
Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government's clear policy has always been to shift
the burden of taxation, over time, from income to spending. This reflects
the Government's underlying political philosophy - that people should be
allowed to keep as much of their own money as possible.
Provided the less well-off are helped, it is fairer and less damaging to the
economy to tax people on how much they consume than on the work they do.
In line with this policy, even in a very difficult year, I have been able to
avoid any increase in income tax rates. But to do this I have had to raise
further revenue from indirect taxation. Let me start with the excise duties.
Road fuel duty
and vehicle excise duty
First, I propose a modest increase in the vehicle excise duty on cars - the
tax disc - of Pounds 5 a year. The duty on lorries will be unaffected.
Second, road fuel duties. With effect from 6.00 pm tonight, I propose to
raise all the road fuel duties by 3 pence a litre. Even so, petrol will
still cost less in the United Kingdom than in most countries in the European
Union and it will be cheaper than it was in real terms in the early 80s. It
is not good policy in these environmentally conscious days to keep road fuel
costs so much cheaper than they used to be. Taken together, these increases
will raise around Pounds  3/4 bn next year. Bus fuel duty rebate will be
held at pre-Budget levels.
In March, my predecessor announced that fuel duties would increase on
average by at least 3 per cent in real terms in future Budgets, in order to
restrain carbon dioxide emissions. The Secretary of State for the
Environment subsequently announced in July that the Government would be
looking at further measures in this area to help to meet our Rio commitment.
I have now decided to strengthen the March commitment by increasing road
fuel duties on average by at least 5 per cent in real terms in future
Budgets.
This will complete Britain's strategy for meeting our Rio commitment. We are
the first country in Europe to do this; and we have done so in a way that
minimises the additional costs to industry.
Mr Deputy Speaker, others in this country and in Europe continue to canvas
unrealistic blueprints for a new European Union-wide carbon tax, which would
impose massive new burdens on British industry. Any critic of the
Government's tax plans who claims also to support the international
agreement to curb carbon dioxide emissions will be sailing dangerously near
to hypocrisy.
Tobacco
Next, tobacco.
With effect from 6.00 pm tonight, the total tax on a packet of 20 cigarettes
will go up by 11 pence - a duty increase of 7.3 per cent. The duties on
other tobacco products will rise by the same proportion.
In addition, I have decided to strengthen the commitment on tobacco duties
that the Government has given in the past.
I intend to increase tobacco duties on average by at least 3 per cent a year
in real terms in future Budgets.
I believe that the approach we are adopting in Britain is the most effective
way to reduce smoking. It is clearly a nonsense for some European countries
to ban advertising to protect state-owned tobacco industries, but then
impose markedly lower levels of tax.
Wine, beer and spirits
Turning next to the duties on alcohol, let me start with beer. I have
listened carefully to the arguments put by the industry about the declining
consumption of beer in this country, the effect of the change to end-product
duty and the growth of cross-Channel imports of beer. Taking all these
factors into account I have decided that for the first time in five Budgets,
there will be no increase this year in the duty on beer.
Let me assure the House that this decision has nothing whatever to do with
the drinking habits of the Chancellor of the Exchequer] And to prove this, I
am also proposing to freeze the duty on spirits for a further year.
The spirits industry, which is a major UK export business, is facing similar
problems to the brewers. I know that my proposals will be warmly welcomed by
the House, and will give RH and HMs from Scotland something to celebrate on
St Andrew's Day.
For wine, sparkling wine and cider, I propose to raise the duty in line with
inflation. This will add 2 pence to a bottle of wine. But it will not take
effect until after Christmas.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the overall effect of all the tax measures I have
announced will be to raise revenue next year by a little under Pounds 1 3/4
bn. By 1995-96, that will rise to about Pounds 5bn, and to Pounds 6bn by
1996-97, about  3/4 per cent of GDP.
These sums fall a long way short of the reduction in the borrowing
requirement I judge necessary. As I announced earlier, I intend with my
Budget to reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement next year, not by
Pounds 1 3/4 bn, but by Pounds 5 1/2 bn, with a reduction by 1996-97 of
Pounds 10 1/2 bn.
The central challenge I have faced in finalising this Budget is how this gap
could be bridged. Every commentator realised that one of my options would be
to extend the VAT base. The main candidates are food, children's clothes,
transport, sewerage and newspapers. A powerful case for each of them can be
made, and no amount of lobbying need put us off. But before looking at that,
I have always made clear that my first responsibility as Chancellor is to
get public expenditure under the firmest possible control.
I have already announced that the Government's new spending plans fully meet
the remit agreed by Cabinet in June.
But when the House comes to study the Red Book it will see that the figures
for the new control total in each of the next three years are different from
those set out in the March Budget and the cash ceilings agreed by the
Cabinet in June.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the explanation for this difference is simple. The
Cabinet has decided to establish new spending plans which are not just
consistent with the ceilings set in June. We have decided to set plans which
in each of the next three years are lower than the June ceilings.
Our spending plans for the coming year have been reduced by more than Pounds
3 1/2 bn. The new control total for next year will be Pounds 3 1/2 bn below
the level we set last year, and Pounds 8 billion below the plans that we
first set two years ago.
And that is not all. In 1995-96 we have reduced the new control total by
Pounds 1 1/2 bn and in 1996-97 by nearly Pounds 3bn. Taking into account
lower debt interest payments resulting from lower borrowing, I expect that,
as a direct result of the Budget, total public spending over the next three
years will be around Pounds 10bn less than we assumed in March.
Including also the reduction in cyclical spending as the economy recovers,
and other changes, the total reduction in public spending over the next
three years compared to the March Budget projections will be no less than
Pounds 15bn.
Those public expenditure savings dramatically reduced my need to raise taxes
to get the borrowing requirement down. As a result of that achievement - and
only because of that - I can now confirm that I have no need this year to
propose any changes to the VAT base.
Throughout the public spending round, all my cabinet colleagues understood
that the essential job in this Budget was to move back towards a balanced
budget.
And we all understood the clear preference on this side of the House for
this to be done, so far as possible, by firm control of public spending.
That is what we said we would deliver.
And that is what we have delivered. Because that is what is required to keep
the recovery going.
Mr Deputy Speaker, my Budget today puts Britain firmly on course for a
sustained period of rising prosperity and falling unemployment, based on low
inflation and healthy public finances.
This is a no-nonsense Budget which deals directly and firmly with the main
challenges facing the country today.
Above all, it is the Budget of a responsible Government which is determined
to bring lasting recovery to Britain.
I commend it to the House.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Bonbons for the backbenches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He was masterly. He could win a party election for prime minister this
morning, and, as prime minister, a general election in a good year. Never
mind the economy. Forget about the interests of the country. Cast aside
thoughts of the public sector borrowing requirement. This was the most
political of Budgets, delivered by the most political of chancellors since
the late Harold Macmillan.
The purpose of Mr Kenneth Clarke's speech was to unite the Conservatives -
behind Mr John Major if possible, behind himself if necessary. His first
task was to save the government; his long-term aim to ensure a fifth
Conservative victory in a row. If yesterday's Budget speech has not taken at
least the first trick, nothing will; as to the second, Fate may have other
plans.
Since he is chancellor, Mr Clarke had to demonstrate a determination to
pursue the path of fiscal responsibility, without inventing new taxes that
backbench Tory rebels might threaten to overturn. If he could manage that,
he could hope to be in a position to cut personal income taxes when the
Conservatives next have to face the electorate. Alternatively he had to find
a seemingly painless way of cutting public spending. If that was not
possible, the hardship had to be borne by unpopular groups like the
unemployed and the supposedly sham disabled.
He achieved all of this, and more, with panache. He took full advantage of
the opportunity open to him as presenter of the first unified tax and
spending Budget, delivering a broad-brush account of government policy as a
whole. At times, as he reminded us of the many departments he has managed
(health, education, the Home Office, a spell at industry), he seemed to be
the prime minister so many people long for.
He was affable, which was no surprise. His speech was intelligible without
being lightweight, which may have come as news to some in his audience. He
was coherent, apparently in command of all facets of government, in control
of the House, rhetorical where appropriate, possessed of a view of what
government should do - in a word, a chancellor with grip, standing
confidently beside a seated prime minister who has been accused of lacking
in that commodity.
Do not misunderstand me. We all know that Budgets that are well-received on
the day of delivery often turn out to be turkeys. The same may be true of
yesterday's effort - as a Budget. We shall soon see. It is also clear, even
at this early stage, that the long-term structural defects of the British
polity remain in place today; the chancellor did not touch upon those.
Again, the Budget was remarkable for its timidity in tackling pressure
groups. Mr Clarke contented himself with brushing aside lobbyists, such as
the brewers, with an empty boast. Yet as a shameless political statement, an
election manifesto, this was the stuff the Conservatives have been missing
for three years. Its effect may not last; that depends upon events beyond
any chancellor's control. But the memory will linger.
Consider his fiscal balancing act. Not too much immediate pain, to get the
government through the next year; not inordinate pain later on, to get it
through the next election. The price of cigarettes, as of petrol and wine,
goes up at once. British voters are accustomed to that, at least in the
early years of a new government. Beer was left alone. How else could Mr
Clarke face his mates in the great British pub? There is the customary
disguised increase in income tax, achieved by freezing allowances next
April; the pension age for women is to be raised to 65 - from the year 2010.
Of considerably more importance is the fact that the chancellor managed to
produce most of next year's reduction in the budget deficit by cutting
projected expenditure. Much of this cut is the result of a public sector pay
freeze, presented as tight control of the central administration. Mr Clarke
has therefore not made the political error of raising the rates of income
tax, thus providing a hostage to political fortune. Would he ever? You can
almost see him grin as he announces in, say, November 1995 that the 20p
income tax band is to be trebled in April 1996 and that, by the by, there
will be an election in May.
All that is tomorrow's politics. Mr Clarke was careful to pay full attention
to today's. Concerned about the forthcoming imposition of VAT on fuel bills?
The chancellor elaborated tight-fisted plans to compensate, to the penny but
no more, all recipients of income support. Worried about losing by-elections
to the grey vote? The VAT compensation is extended to all pensioners. On top
of that, a guaranteed income bond will reassure the many old dears hurt by
falling interest rates on their building society deposits. Tell them that in
Christchurch.
Labour going on about tax loopholes? Mr Clarke obligingly closed Pounds 2bn
worth, and derided the opposition for talking of five times as much. Uneasy
about the tightening up of unemployment benefit, the introduction of near
workfare, and the new rules for invalidity payments? Soothe your conscience
with the new allowance for childcare for low earners on family credit. This
last is a classic example of Mr Clarke's way of proclaiming his own
political philosophy without upsetting anyone. Right-wingers have attacked
single parents; Mr Clarke says he will to help them get back to work - and
heaps fulsome praise on Mr Michael Portillo, leader of the right. His speech
was nevertheless peppered with references to the European Union, as if to
remind everyone that he is in favour of our continuing and constructive
membership thereof.
The list of political debts paid, traps avoided, useful phrases laid down
for future reference, and egos massaged is too long to rehearse here. Small
businesses may yet be able to charge interest to late payers. The smallest
will not require an audit. Investment in unquoted companies is to be
encouraged by several means. There will be venture capital trusts and an
enterprise investment scheme. It was as if the chancellor was facing, not
the opposition, but the benches behind him, and casting out bonbons to each
cluster of interested parties.
His use of words is also purely political. Not for our chancellor the 'if it
isn't hurting it isn't working' of Mr Major when he had the job, or the
'price well worth paying' characterisation of unemployment by his
predecessor Mr Norman Lamont. 'A good social security system, under which
the better off and people in work pay to support the poor and the
disadvantaged, is an essential feature of a modern civilised state,' says Mr
Clarke, cutting social security. 'Why should the bus driver or the pensioner
. . . pay higher taxes to finance the living costs of tomorrow's lawyers?'
he asks, while cutting student grants. Mr Major grinned admiringly and
tapped Mr Clarke, the lawyer, on the behind with his papers as the
chancellor said that.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: An early Christmas - The bond markets' wishes
have been granted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was all the bond markets could really have wanted. By risking damage to
future economic growth and, it has to be said, by stretching credulity a
long way with his public spending projections, Kenneth Clarke has opened up
a route to low interest rates and, eventually, a balanced budget - should he
or a successor ever really want to go that far.
It was a challenge that Norman Lamont failed adequately to square up to last
spring. His borrow-now-tax-later formula left the markets cold, and both
gilts and equities struggled for several months. Now Kenneth Clarke looks
like the kind of tough customer that the markets respond to.
But there will be casualties, notably in the banks and building societies as
they prepare for the decline of their deposit base. They may feel they could
have done without the gratuitous sideswipe of a pensioners' bond featuring
the 'decent, fixed rate of return' that the old folk presumably will no
longer get from the Halifax or the Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Will Clarke escape the building society wrath that descended upon Lamont
when he introduced First Option Bonds at an aggressive interest rate?
As for rates in the government bond market, long-dated gilt-edged yields had
already slipped below 7 per cent last Monday, for the first time in 25
years. Although corresponding US Treasury bond rates have backed up by half
a percentage point since mid-October, sterling bonds have proved resistant
to the international reversal. At the 10-year maturity the spread between US
and UK government bond yields has shrunk from 2 percentage points in May to
less than half that now.
The Budget's arithmetic offers some good reasons why this should be so.
Although the current financial year's borrowing requirement has not been
reduced as many expected, some Pounds 6bn is knocked off the forecast for
1994-95. The cut in what used to be called the contingency reserve may need
more leisurely scrutiny, but lower interest rates will bring their own
reward: debt interest will hardly be rising in total, even though the
aggregate of government indebtedness will still be rising quite fast over
the next two or three years.
Moreover Clarke has decided to listen to the pleadings of some of his
independent advisers, notably Tim Congdon, and underfund by Pounds 7bn over
the next year and a half, to offset past purchases by the banking sector.
That means, perhaps, a Pounds 10bn reduction in the issuance next financial
year compared with earlier projections.
It is strange to recall that back in March Lamont seemed to be facing a big
challenge in financing his deficit. In the event it has proved childishly
simple against the background of tumbling bond rates worldwide. But that was
unpredictable good fortune. Clarke has rightly decided that he cannot risk
the global bond market turning nasty, as indeed it may have begun to do.
In the first six months of 1993-94 foreigners bought Pounds 8.3bn net of
gilts, an unprecedented rate of take-up. In a global marketplace this may be
neither here nor there: gilts have only a 5 per cent weighting in global
government bond portfolios, and this could easily go higher. But it would
mean accepting the interest rates set by the Americans and Germans, plus a
premium.
Now the prospective easing of the pace of issues will mean that gilt
issuance will fall back within the reasonably comfortable digestive capacity
of domestic investors. Beyond next year, of course, government borrowing is
now scheduled for further sharp drops, but only time will tell what will
actually happen in the run-up to the next general election, possibly in late
1996.
What about the London equity market? It has been led up by gilts all year
and no doubt it will continue to be so. The Budget is not quite so
unequivocally favourable, however, because the future rises in the personal
tax burden over the next three years look quite steep. Positively, though,
the tax threat to pension funds has proved a false alarm.
Falling interest rates, short and long, almost always send share prices
higher. Unfortunately Tokyo is proving how that rule can be broken - but the
circumstances are, of course, very different.
Economic prospects in the UK are certainly brighter than they are in Japan.
True, next year's projected economic growth rate has been slightly trimmed
back (albeit from a higher base in 1993) and the previously programmed
export boom scaled down in the face of recession in continental Europe.
Astonishing statistical revisions to the balance of payments numbers have
eased one threat, again at the risk of disbelief. But some outside
forecasters are less optimistic that the UK can go it alone in growth terms
in Europe quite as the Treasury is suggesting.
What we do not yet know is whether the government will push interest rates
more aggressively lower and aim for a weaker sterling exchange rate that
would push up the growth rate and bolster company profits. An inflation
forecast hovering just above 3 per cent in late 1994 suggests there will be
official caution because of the risk of importing inflation through
devaluation.
Even so, a fall in short-term interest rates to 5 and then maybe 4 per cent
is plainly in prospect next year, and the trend presents a serious strategic
challenge to the building societies and banks that hold some Pounds 250bn of
personal sector interest-bearing deposits.
They should start planning on the basis of a yield curve running from 4 up
to 6 per cent. In this event many building societies may not be able to
survive by collecting short-term retail deposits, and forced to seek a way
out by turning themselves into mortgage banks funded mainly through the
capital market.
Savings would then be collected on a much larger scale by unit trust
companies and channelled into bond issues as well as equity funds. Such are
the structural questions that must be faced up to when a chancellor opens
the way to financial conditions not experienced for a generation.
Whatever the head-scratching in Halifax, for the bond market Christmas has
come early. If you believe in fairies, and in Kenneth Clarke's public
spending estimates, you really can fly, but with luck not to Never-Never
Land.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax philosophy lost among the politics - John
Plender says the chancellor's plans may be seductive but are marred by
fiscal brutalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politically effective it may have been. But from a fiscal point of view the
Budget was a vintage mixed bag. The chancellor revealed himself to be a man
with one big idea - knocking the public finances back into shape - and an
alarmingly motley collection of small ideas. If he succeeds in his main
economic objective, it will be at the cost of any coherence in the tax
system. The aspiration to tax reform, which rode high under Nigel (now Lord)
Lawson and survived in diluted form under his successors John Major and
Norman Lamont, must be counted well and truly dead after yesterday's
performance.
It would be pointless to search for an underlying philosophy of taxation in
Mr Clarke's speech. Nor would he, one suspects, wish to be accused of
entertaining so grandiose a notion. To the extent that there was a logic to
it all, it was purely political: a classic exercise in shifting the share of
taxation among different groups in order to minimise political damage and
maximise potential advantage. In short, the fiscal lollipops were dispensed
and withdrawn with great abandon. Fiscal neutrality - the doctrine that
taxation should not unduly influence decisions about saving, working and
spending - did not get a look in. That goal, the cornerstone of the 1980s
tax reforms, has vanished.
Nor did Mr Clarke show much respect for his predecessor's efforts. Mr
Lamont's reform of the married couple's allowance earlier this year has now
been superseded by another measure whereby the relief will be restricted to
a wholly arbitrary 15 per cent. On this basis allowances no longer bear any
obvious relation to the broader structure of income tax. Those that lack
political appeal will presumably be adjusted henceforth to whatever rate
will maximise revenue at an acceptable political cost.
That appears to be the fate of mortgage interest relief, which Lady Thatcher
fought so ferociously to preserve against the Lawson onslaught. Policy under
Norman Lamont had already moved beyond the approach of permitting the relief
to 'wither on the vine'. By restricting the relief to 15 per cent when the
housing market is depressed Mr Clarke has, in effect, signalled an earlier
death for this anomalous relief.
That is all to the good. The relief was always capitalised in the value of
the existing owner's home, thereby discriminating against the first-time
buyer it was supposed to help. How far the new move will offend existing
mortgagors may depend on the readiness of building societies to reduce rates
further.
There remain, admittedly, some modest echoes from the reformist period. Mr
Clarke's reshuffling followed the tried and tested pattern of broadening the
tax base, increasing indirect taxation, and restricting or reducing
allowances and reliefs in the income tax system. But it was more form than
substance. There was little attempt to reduce economic distortions, except
in the form of clamping down on tax loopholes - an expedient that carried a
political bonus by permitting a sideswipe at the opposition leader John
Smith, who claims to see outsize gains for the Exchequer in anti-avoidance
provisions. And by freezing allowances the Chancellor inevitably brings more
people into the tax net, which is hardly desirable, even if the political
consequences are not particularly harmful.
None of this means that the specific measures in Mr Clarke's package are
without their individual merits. The cuts in employers' national insurance
contributions are a modest start in addressing a genuine labour market
problem, by making it easier for employers to take on more people.
There is no doubt administrative logic, as well as cost savings, in the
decision to combine the operations of income support and unemployment
benefit. And while the credit for introducing resource accounting into
Whitehall really lies with Mr Clarke's predecessors, it is no less welcome
for that. A more sophisticated approach to accounting for public sector
capital spending has been long overdue.
At least Mr Clarke has been prepared to risk unpopularity as well as to
court approval from groups such as pensioners whose problems with VAT on
domestic fuel have been addressed with specific palliatives. It is not
merely the novel decision to announce continuing 3 per cent increases on
tobacco excise in real terms. Equalising the pension age at 65 will alienate
many female voters under the age of 40.
By far the most interesting omission was the failure to impose a further cut
in the tax credit on dividends received by pension funds. Clearly the
pensions lobby has scored a victory in the short term. But in the longer run
the chancellor has entrusted his financial secretary Mr Stephen Dorrell with
a review that will look into the impact of taxation on savings. That is
overdue - not least because Mr Lamont's attack on the pension funds removed
all coherence from one of the few parts of the income tax system that made
much sense.
The one thing that is clear from both the cuts in reliefs and allowances,
and the new taxes such as the one on insurance premiums, is that Mr Clarke
has left himself considerable latitude to raise more from tax in future.
Fiscal brutalism might be the appropriate motto for a Budget that very much
reflects the man.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Novice makes mark - Surprises on the spending
side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Clarke's budget is the work of a political heavyweight. Unlike his
predecessor, Mr Clarke knows little about the minutiae of tax. He has spent
his political life in the spending departments. It was thus wholly
appropriate that the big surprise should have been on the spending side.
Mr Clarke has done what the markets most wanted and least expected. He has
cut the PSBR by cutting public spending. The control totals decided by the
Cabinet in June were genuinely tough. Many doubted whether they would be
achieved. Mr Clarke has proved to be an over-achiever.
He not been too particular in his methods. Freezing public sector pay is a
powerful way of keeping public spending under control, but it is also
arbitrary and unfair. It sits ill with the rhetoric of a government which
emphasises its commitment to quality public services.
But it is to his credit that he has taken difficult decisions that will
reduce public spending in the medium term. He has seized, at last, the
opportunity provided by the need to equalise the pension ages of men and
women and levelled the retirement age upwards. He has removed an absurd
incentive to malinger by abolishing the untaxed Invalidity Benefit and
replacing it with the new Incapcity Benefit. He has taken further steps
along the road to replacing student grants with student loans.
Each change sends a powerful signal. All will reduce public spending in the
medium term by more than the immediate savings. They are sensible decisions
by a no-nonsense Chancellor who has proved, time and again in his political
career, that he is not afraid to take on vested interests and pressure
groups if he thinks it is in the national interest to do so.
The changes have been on the Treasury agenda for some time. They are
precisely the sort of sensible, radical, but painful, reforms that Treasury
officials devise in the course of the public spending round. The better
chief secretaries - and Mr Portillo is certainly one of those - usually
incorporate such suggestions into their negotiating stance with the spending
department. But they all too frequently fail at the final hurdle. The
clearest sign that we now have a political heavyweight in charge of economic
policy is that Mr Clarke has been able to carry these changes through
Cabinet. The Clarke-Portillo axis has proved a formidable force.
The result is a dream budget for the financial markets. The government has
slashed Pounds 6 1/2 bn off borrowing for next year. The only worry about
that achievement is that most of the cut in public spending next year comes
from the contingency reserve. It has reduced the projected borrowing for
1997-98 by no less than Pounds 18bn.
As if that were not enough, the government has finally recognised the case
for underfunding the PSBR. There will be Pounds 7 1/2 bn of borrowing not
funded by gilts sales. The change in the balance of supply and demand for in
the gilts market is dramatic. This budget should give a new lease of life to
the long upswing in gilts prices. We should reap the benefits of further
cuts in short rates before too long.
It is for that reason that underfunding has been advocated for some time by
those of us who remain concerned about the strength and durability of the
recovery. Confidence is still lacking - evidence for that lies in the
continued sluggish growth of bank lending and the broader measures of the
money supply. An injection of liquidy could give the recovery a much-needed
shot in the arm.
Underfunding will also reduce the government's debt interest bill. As long
as there is no sign of inflationary danger - and there isn't - it can be
justified on these grounds alone. Until now, however, the arguments for
underfunding have fallen on deaf ears. The change of heart is as welcome as
it is remarkable.
The City may, however, be less entranced with Mr Clarke's tax measures. We
had got used to seeing Autumn Statements which promised deferred virtue on
the public spending side - a sharp rate of increase over the next year or
two followed by a grinding halt. We are spared that this year - we get the
biggest cut in public spending in year one. Instead, we get virtue deferred
on the tax side - a Pounds 6bn increase in 1996-97, compared with only
Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95.
However, it would be wrong to take a wholly cynical view of these future
increases. It is worth noting that we now, as a matter of course, get
presented with tax plans over the same three-year horizon as the spending
plans. That is an inevitable, and welcome, consequence of bringing together
tax and spending plans. It has enabled Mr Clarke to put in place some
long-run plans for tax increases and score the benefit in the medium term
PSBR projections.
He has taken the opportunity to use tax increases to help the government hit
a couple of important targets outside the economic sphere. Compared with
earlier projections, the 5 per cent a year real increase in fuel duties will
reduce fuel consumption in the medium term and help meet the Rio conference
targets on the environment. And on the same basis, the 3 per cent a year
real increase in tobacco duties will reduce consumption and help meet health
targets. Both changes are politically shrewd moves which make economic
sense.
The same cannot be said of the chancellor's revenue raising measures on the
income tax side. Mr Lamont found a clever way of raising revenue by reducing
the value of various tax allowances - the married couples' allowance,
mortgage interest relief - to 20 per cent. That could be justified as an
early move towards a reduction in the value of these allowance which would
be inevitable in due course as the 20 per cent rate became the standard rate
of tax.
Mr Clarke has plundered the same source, by reducing the value of these
allowances to 15 per cent, for which there is no conceivable justification
except expedience. The chancellor has left the income tax system in a
horrible mess, but the man in the street, who doesn't understand the system
anyway, neither knows nor cares. He will be pleased to be spared the tax
increases that were so widely anticipated.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Mr Clarke shows his skills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's performance rounded out the picture of Mr Clarke as a skilful
politician who does not fit easily into any political pigeon hole. He is
fiscally tough, notably so on public sector employees. Hostile to the call
of certain colleagues for 'family values', Mr Clarke is tender towards some
of those dependent on the welfare state. He ignores cries for help from big
firms, but shows a soft spot for small business. As for the arguments for
tax neutrality that meant much to Lord Lawson, these evidently leave him
cold. The picture he paints is, in short, one of a pragmatic, tough, cunning
and ambitious man.
The most striking feature of this, the UK's first ever unified Budget, is
its fiscal orthodoxy. Mr Lamont had already announced substantial fiscal
adjustments for 1994-95 and 1995-96 of Pounds 6.7bn and Pounds 10.3bn,
respectively. Mr Clarke adds to this a further Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95,
Pounds 4.9bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 6.1bn in 1996-97. But this is not all he
does. He adds spending austerity as well.
The result is a noteworthy change in prospects for the public sector
borrowing requirement. At Mr Clarke's hands, the PSBR falls from 8 1/2 per
cent of gross domestic product (excluding privatisation proceeds) this
financial year to 6 1/4 per cent in 1994-95 and 1 3/4 per cent by 1997-98.
By contrast, only last March Mr Lamont forecast a PSBR of 7 1/4 per cent of
GDP next year and 4 per cent of GDP even in 1997-98. Mr Clarke stated: 'The
overriding need is to place the public finances on a sound footing.' That
judgment is right. Even though his forecasts look rosy, he has probably done
enough to ensure this outcome.
The rosiness of the perspective is not in the forecasts for growth. This
year's growth in non-North Sea real GDP is projected at 1 3/4 per cent,
barely up from the 1 1/2 per cent expected in March. Thereafter, these
forecasts are unchanged. They are for 2 1/4 per cent growth in 1994-95, 2
3/4 per cent in 1995-96 and 3 per cent thereafter. These projections are not
that optimistic.
With forecasts for the economy largely unchanged, the impact of Mr Clarke
can be judged by changes in shares of public spending and taxation in GDP by
comparison with the legacy of his predecessor. Under Mr Lamont, the share of
general government expenditure in GDP was to fall by 2 1/4 percentage points
of GDP between 1993-94 and 1997-98. Under Mr Clarke, by contrast, it is to
fall by 3 1/4 percentage points. Similarly, under Mr Lamont the share of
general government receipts was to rise by 2 3/4 percentage points. Now it
is to rise by 4 percentage points. So Mr Clarke intends to achieve the
improvements he seeks by roughly equal adjustments on the spending and
revenue sides.
Is this credible? The tax increases are more or less in the bag, presuming
the recovery goes as planned. Spending control is not. The reduction in the
new control totals for non-cyclical spending is accounted for by changes in
the reserve. While normal, this means analysis must focus mainly on the
departmental figures.
The overall increase in the control total in real terms between 1993-94 and
1996-97 is set at only 0.6 per cent. Real spending on health is shown
unchanged, as is support for local government, while spending on defence is
to fall 12 per cent in real terms. Education does better, with an increase
of 5.3 per cent, but even spending on social security is expected to
increase only 2.3 per cent. Low planned increases in real spending over a
period of three years in highly sensitive areas will be possible only if the
government can maintain its planned constraint on running costs, with wage
bills unchanged in real terms.
Is this believable or even desirable? It is not believable that the relative
pay of public sector workers, whose productivity will never rise as fast as
in some other areas of the economy, can be reduced indefinitely. An
explosion is almost certain, perhaps in the run-up to the next election. But
this is also undesirable, because it makes a nonsense of the role of review
bodies in setting public sector pay.
Yet even if the government fails to achieve its ambitious goals on public
spending, this Budget should achieve, with its announced fiscal changes and
even limited success on spending, what the chancellor set out to do. With
Pounds 7bn of underfunding as well this year, the gilts markets have every
reason to cheer. This Budget should allow further interest rate cuts and,
with luck, sustained recovery.
There is rather less reason to cheer some of the details. The various
offsets to the cost of value added tax on fuel were justified. But the
result, a cost of Pounds 1 1/4 bn extra in 1996-97, offsets a great deal of
the additional Pounds 3bn the measure would raise in a full year. No wonder
Mr Clarke decided to avoid further changes to VAT, even where they could
have been justified.
A noteworthy feature is the chancellor's fiscal tinkering. The freezing of
allowances is, for example, bound to bring ever more people into the tax
net, an unattractive development. The introduction of a new, unheralded 15
per cent rate of allowance for mortgage interest relief and the married
couple's allowance, reasonable in itself, is also a destabilising precedent.
The long-sought elimination of one old distorting scheme, the Business
Expansion Scheme, is promptly offset by a new one, the Enterprise Investment
Scheme. Some fiscal changes do look sensible in themselves, the tax on
insurance premiums, for example, and on air passengers. For all that, Mr
Clarke offers not the germ of an idea on the proper direction of the tax
system as a whole.
This criticism is a little less true of spending, where he evidently
benefits from his own background and the hard work of two Thatcherite
minsters, Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley. The introduction of a
'job seeker's allowance' and 'incapacity benefit' look defensible.
Reductions in support for students are even to be welcomed. But he remains
sturdily eclectic. His strong statement of support for the principles of the
welfare state is notable. Introduction of the first direct support for
childcare, targeted at single mothers, alongside a further reduction in the
tax benefit to married couples, is a more specific example of the
chancellor's non-Thatcherite, non-family values.
This is not a Budget with a big idea on tax or a big idea on spending. It
contains, instead, many little ideas, of varying quality, on both. But Mr
Clarke does have one big idea, frugality. This is a tough Budget from a
tough man. It is the right Budget for the times.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: A sigh of relief that recovery will live on -
Tony Jackson gauges the reaction of industry and finds general approval
mixed with specific grumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As one who makes much of his roots in Midlands manufacturing, chancellor
Kenneth Clarke might be expected to be nice to British industry. In
rhetorical terms, he took every opportunity yesterday to declare how close
industry was to his heart. How much this means in practice may be a matter
for the small print of the Budget rather than the headlines.
In broad terms, industry expressed itself satisfied yesterday. There was
grumbling from the engineers and machine tool makers, which had urged the
necessity of further tax breaks for investment. But on the big question of
whether the recovery would be killed by taxes, there was general relief. A
total of Pounds 1.7bn in new taxation next year and Pounds 4.9bn the year
after, it was felt, was a burden the consumer could live with.
The Confederation of British Industry last night applauded Mr Clarke's
'tough decisions' on public spending, and said the budget 'should provide a
sound base for continued non-inflationary recovery'. The traditionally more
hawkish Institute of Directors expressed relief at the limited scale of tax
increases, while arguing Mr Clarke could have gone even further on public
spending cuts. The British Retail Consortium said: 'This is a skilfully
balanced Budget, which will help boost the confidence of both retailer and
consumer.'
One reason for the chancellor's solicitude towards industry could be gleaned
from the details accompanying the speech. In spite of last September's
devaluation of sterling, the government is plainly still concerned that the
balance of payments deficit might inhibit recovery.
Mr Clarke went out of his way yesterday to point out that in the past three
months, exports had risen 14 per cent: 'a convincing demonstration of the
strength of British manufacturing today.'
The Treasury evidently expects more of the same. In Mr Norman Lamont's March
Budget, the current account deficit for next year was forecast at Pounds
18.5bn. The official forecast has now shrunk to half that - just Pounds
9.5bn. At the same time, profitability of UK companies, says the official
Red Book, is expected to be well up in 1993 on its 1992 level.
'In 1994 it is expected to pick up further as recovery strengthens, labour
costs remain in check and pressure on margins eases further', the Red Book
says.
Similarly, business investment is forecast to rise by 3.75 per cent in
volume terms next year. This is despite the fact that, as the Red Book
concedes, it was actually 1.75 per cent down in the first nine months of
this year. Here as elsewhere, there are hints that some of the chancellor's
assumptions many be a trifle heroic.
This may also apply to the other side of the equation: public spending.
Several respected economists were starting to mutter yesterday that the
projected cutbacks looked implausible. They are, however, central to the
chancellor's message to business.
Government spending, he said, constituted a substantial risk for business
next year. 'Business can only plan ahead if it knows government borrowing is
under control. My task today is to instil that confidence.'
In some cases, it sounds as if cuts in spending are to come out of
industry's hide. The budgets for roads and housing are to be cut, in hopes
of getting the same output. Construction prices next year, Mr Clarke said
ominously, would be more than 25 per cent lower than in 1989, so the
programmes could be maintained in real terms for much less money.
Some other details yesterday might give rise to suspicion. The move to stop
reimbursing sick pay - except for the smallest companies - will cost
industry Pounds 700m a year for the next three years. Doubtless, this will
be partly offset by lower employer national insurance contributions. It
remains to be seen, however, how the two changes will interact in individual
cases.
Similarly, the airlines were distinctly miffed at the decision to tax air
passengers a collective Pounds 330m a year on leaving British airports. As
one airline chief remarked, it rather looked as if the government was
reluctant to impose VAT, since this would logically entail also taxing rail
passengers ahead of privatisation. Having instead stumbled upon the neat
expedient of stinging businessmen flying at their companies' expense, the
Treasury might find it hard to resist coming back for more in future.
There was also widespread scepticism in the construction industry over the
list of projects to be financed by the private sector. The only new item on
the list, it seems, is the new air traffic control centre for Scotland. As
for the grandiose scheme for the private management of motorways, the
construction companies would prefer to see the Treasury's proposed terms
before getting excited. As Mr Clarke himself conceded yesterday, the private
finance system requires 'a complete change of culture in government'.
When it comes to small businesses, Mr Clarke deserves full marks for trying.
Helping small business, he said, was his particular priority this year. Some
of the moves on deregulation and the cutting of red tape were familiar,
having already been trumpeted by the industry minister Mr Michael Heseltine.
But the removal of the requirement for a statutory audit for small companies
is a genuine innovation. So, in the separate field of small company cash
flow, is the proposal that companies should be legally entitled to charge
interest on overdue bills.
The proposals for increasing the supply of risk capital for small companies
 -the installation of investment trusts for unquoted companies and a
replacement for the generally reviled Business Expansion Scheme - probably
amount to little. But as employers' organisations acknowledged yesterday, it
all adds up to a sustained attempt to help out the small businessmen who
form the Tory party's natural constituency.
Above all, Mr Clarke has shown adroitness in allowing expectations to build
up of VAT and other tax increases, then deflate them. There was an unusual
emphasis on keeping the consumer happy. Even the rise in excise on wine, the
chancellor said, would not take effect until after Christmas, while there is
no extra duty on beer at all.
Mr John Clare, managing director of Dixons, the electrical stores group,
doubtless spoke for many shopkeepers yesterday. 'It was nowhere near as bad
as we expected. The expectations of tax increases in the Budget caused a lot
of uncertainty in the retail business - people don't want to spend until
they know where they stand. That's gone now. Let's get on with Christmas.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Saint Augustine rides again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget should please the most fiercely opposed schools of fiscal
commentators. Those most intent on balancing the Budget will be pleased to
see a faster path for reducing the deficit than the one projected by Norman
Lamont. A borrowing requirement of Pounds 38bn is projected for next year,
compared with an original projection of Pounds 44bn; and for 1996-97 the
projection has been reduced from Pounds 35bn to Pounds 21bn.
Indeed the projections have now been pushed out to 1998-99, showing a
virtually balanced Budget. And as a percentage of GDP the public sector
borrowing requirement is expected to fall from 7 3/4 per cent this year to 5
1/2 per cent next year, and 2 3/4 per cent in 1996-97.
The picture could have been made to look better still if Kenneth Clarke had
been more interested in the separate estimate of net capital spending which
now appears prominently for the first time in the Budget Red Book. If this
is taken off the public spending total, the public sector emerges with a
current deficit of 4 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 and 1 1/4 per cent in
1996-97. This is well within the limits of safe borrowing according to
almost any theory of the permissible Budget deficit. If we continue the same
projection, there is a current balance the following year and a current
surplus of 1 1/4 per cent of GDP by 1998-99.
Let us please have no sneers at the Treasury for projecting trends towards
the end of the century. It is commonplace that the full effects of decisions
taken now are felt several years ahead. The Treasury used to be criticised
for short termism when it put all the emphasis on the immediately coming
fiscal year. So let us not criticise it for trying to look a little further
ahead.
On the other hand, those of us who regard the national Budget as a matter of
economic policy, and who distrust the analogy between the government's
finances and those of a household or corporation, can also find some cheer.
For there is very little in the Budget that will reduce demand or slow down
the recovery in the next year and a half. For those who accepted Norman
Lamont's last Budget, with its deferred tax increases, as a reasonable
compromise between the two schools of thought, there is little more to
swallow.
For like his predecessor, the present chancellor has been an apt pupil of St
Augustine, who asked God to make him chaste, but not yet. Looking further
ahead, the Treasury is obviously relying on world economic recovery and a
self-generated upturn to offset the fiscal tightening in the pipeline.
Nevertheless Mr Clarke has planned to reduce public sector borrowing by
Pounds 6 1/2 bn even in 1994-95, an amount corresponding to 1 per cent of
GDP. How has he managed to do this? The table shows that he has done this
overwhelmingly by curbing general government expenditure, which is to be
reduced by Pounds 5 1/2 bn below that planned by Mr Lamont. By the later
1990s the proportions will be reversed. In 1997-98, for example, some Pounds
11bn of the planned Pounds 18bn tightening will come from higher taxes and
contributions.
How has the chancellor managed his 1994-95 feat? My gut view is that the
forward projections were always too pessimistic and that economic recovery
and lower inflation have done the rest.
But readers have a right to know the Treasury arithmetic and not just my
instincts. The detail of this may surprise people. For, of the Pounds 5 1/2
bn reduction in planned spending next year, some Pounds 2bn comes from lower
debt interest and reduced spending on social security due, not to any of the
new measures, but to economic recovery. The whole of the remaining Pounds 3
1/2 bn comes from a reduction in the reserve (previously called, more
informatively, contingency reserve) planned for next year.
An unscrupulous official Opposition spokesman could here cry 'foul', and
hardly more than two or three Conservative MPs, if that, would be able to
answer. But if we are interested not in point scoring but in the logic of
programme planning, it makes complete sense to reduce the reserve in this
way. For the Treasury has, quite sensibly, a reserve which increases in size
the further ahead one goes. As the coming financial year approaches, it
reduces the reserve for that year by Pounds 3 1/2 bn and pushes the whole
series out a year further.
If there are any virtuous public spending economies, it is in holding down
the demands of the spending departments, so that the Treasury did not feel
obliged to allocate the reserve among spending programmes but has left it in
at a normal figure.
On the tax side the interest lies not in the extra burden next year, but in
how the chancellor expects to raise more revenue by the middle and later
1990s. The most important single item is higher excise duties on road fuels;
the second most important is the reduction in the married couple's allowance
to 15 per cent; and the third is a similar reduction in mortgage interest
relief. The fourth most important item is an insurance premium tax, which is
a slight step towards reducing privileges and gaps in the tax base. It is
only when it comes to the fifth most important item, higher taxes on
tobacco, that one sees the hand of the Virginia Bottomley nanny state.
The Treasury's economic forecasts have become a little more cheerful. Next
year's bulge in the underlying RPI is expected to stay well below the upper
4 per cent government inflation range. For once this projection and that of
continuing further reductions in inflation seems credible so long as the
government avoids a pre-election dash for growth, 'benign neglect' of
sterling and all the other temptations.
Non-North Sea real GDP is now expected to rise by 1 3/4 per cent this year,
and 2 1/4 per cent in 1994-95. But it is not until 1995 onwards that output
will be rising by something near the 3 per cent rate required to make
serious inroads into the gap between actual and potential output, which is
the real measure of economic depression. Looking at the bare numbers, the
growth projections still seem too low to make many inroads into the margin
of unused capacity until well into 1995. On the other hand, the actual
behaviour of unemployment, the CBI Survey of unused capacity and the
government's own social security projections suggest that the margin of
slack is already declining. There is a consistency problem to sort out in
the economic indicators.
Of course, a market-oriented government cannot plan growth directly. But it
can have a policy for the growth of spending in cash terms, which is
approximated by nominal GDP. The projections here are 6 per cent plus growth
for the next couple of years, then declining to the 5 to 6 per cent range,
These seem adequate to finance non-inflationary growth. But the trouble is
that they are only projections, and there is no sign of a government
commitment to make it happen, even roughly as a trend.
To make this serious, an international rather than a merely parochial
medium-term financial strategy is required. It is all too easy to blame the
Bundesbank for not being keen on the idea. But there is not the slightest
sign that the Treasury or the Bank is doing anything to push it.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Impact on incomes will be felt into the next
century - The Institute for Fiscal Studies analyses the Budget's effects on
households / What it means for society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The effects on household incomes of Kenneth Clarke's first Budget will be
felt well into the next century, with the announcement of an equalisation of
the state pension age at 65.
Rather more pressingly, the chancellor announced a wide range of measures on
social security benefits, tax allowances and excise duties which will be in
place next April. These, coupled with the measures already announced by
Norman Lamont for April 1994, will leave households an average Pounds 4.60
per week worse off than if both chancellors had simply presented 'do
nothing' Budgets which operated tax allowances in line with inflation and
left tax rates unchanged.
However, as the charts show, the effects on individual households vary
greatly, with the richest households losing on average more than Pounds 10
per week and the poorest households losing less than Pounds 1 per week from
the two packages.
The main tax increases already announced by Norman Lamont in his March
Budget will cost households an average Pounds 4.20 per week. The principal
measures here are the increase in the rate of employee national insurance
contributions, the restriction in value of the married couples's tax
allowance and of mortgage interest tax relief, and the imposition of VAT on
fuel at 8 per cent.
The losses among the low income households arise almost exclusively from the
VAT change, while far more important to better off households are the cuts
in tax allowances and the NIC increase.
The new measures announced yesterday to be implemented by next April imply
only a modest additional cut in living standards next year for the
population as a whole. But this average figure disguises big variations for
particular groups.
Pensioners and disabled people have in general done better than might have
been expected out of the Budget. They will on average receive something
approaching full compensation for the imposition of VAT on fuel and so
losses among these groups fall significantly compared with the pure 'Lamont
effect'.
However, households headed by single pensioners still end up an average of
70p per week worse off, not least because of the increases in duties on
tobacco and petrol. Married pensioners as a group are on average Pounds 1.50
a week worse off with the cut in value of the married couples' tax allowance
adding to the effects of VAT and other tax increases.
While the compensation package for VAT on fuel provided roughly adequate
compensation for those over pension age, the same cannot be said even of low
income households below pension age. The chancellor announced that
income-related benefits for non-pensioners would be increased in April 1994
by 0.4 per cent - namely the effect on the Retail Prices Index of imposing 8
per cent VAT.
However, the RPI is based on average spending patterns. Since low income
households spend a significantly larger proportion of their income than the
average on fuel they would need a bigger increase than this to provide full
compensation. In other words, the compensation package does not even provide
adequate compensation on average for low income non-pensioners, leaving
aside any variations in individual circumstances.
The second chart highlights this by showing that even after benefit
increases lone parents will still have to find an extra Pounds 2 a week and
unwaged couples with children an extra Pounds 1 a week by next April.
It is worth remembering that even within these various family types there
will be a wide variety of outcomes from the Budget. Thus around one in eight
pensioners will actually gain modestly overall. An example of a gainer will
be a pensioner living in a well insulated house, perhaps in the warmer south
of England, and with an active lifestyle leading to low domestic fuel
consumption. For such pensioners the 50p increase in the single pension will
more than cover the effects of VAT on their fuel bills.
It is also important to note the tax changes which have still to come, over
and above those included in the above charts. Because the charts focus on
April 1994 they exclude the extension of VAT to insurance next autumn, the
imposition of the full rate of VAT on fuel in April 1995, the further cuts
in the married couple's allowance and mortgage interest relief, also planned
for 1995, and the cuts to social security benefits (mainly invalidity
benefit and unemployment benefit) to be phased in over the next few years.
They also exclude the above-inflation increases to cigarette and petrol
duties apart from those planned for April 1994.
The combined effect of all these changes will be to reduce weekly incomes by
around a further Pounds 3 on average by April 1995.
The results in the charts show how much each group loses on average in
pounds per week and show losses rising with income. Another important
question is how the losses look when expressed as a proportion of
households' income after taxes. On this basis, the measures still seem to
bear more heavily on richer households, costing the richest half of the
population around 2 per cent of their after-tax income whilst the poorest
tenth lose only around 0.75 per cent of their after-tax income.
On balance, Mr Kenneth Clarke has been more successful than his predecessor
in placing the burden of financing the government's borrowing requirement on
the shoulders of richer households. However, our analysis suggests that for
low-income families below pension age the chancellor may not have gone far
enough.
The results are produced by the IFS computer model of the personal tax and
benefits system. The model applies the Budget measures to a representative
sample of 7,000 households drawn from the latest Family Expenditure Survey,
and works out which sorts of households gain and lose and by how much.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Cuts phased in to protect recovery - Miras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE
A further reduction in the rate of mortgage interest relief, taking it to 15
per cent from April 1995.
IN DETAIL
The rate of mortgage interest relief will come down by 5 per cent in each of
the next two years, falling from 25 per cent at present to 20 per cent in
April next year as announced in the March Budget, and to 15 per cent in
April the following year. The ceiling of Pounds 30,000 on the amount of home
loan that qualifies for relief will remain unchanged.
This latest reduction would cost someone with an endowment mortgage of
Pounds 30,000 or more about Pounds 10 a month. This was only a 'tiny
fraction' of the benefits people had received from the fall in interest
rates over the past three years, the chancellor said, but will come on top
of the similar-sized increase in monthly payments as a result of the cut in
the relief announced in March.
The effect of the reduction in relief will be offset by the cuts in mortgage
rates expected to be announced shortly by many of the largest building
societies in the wake of last week's 0.5 of a percentage point cut in base
rates. The Nationwide has indicated that it will be cutting its mortgage
rate from 7.99 per cent to 7.74 per cent, and other societies are expected
to follow suit.
THE BACKGROUND
While the combined effect of the two-stage change will be an increase in
mortgage repayments of Pounds 20 or so a month, the phasing of the cuts in
mortgage interest relief appears to be helping to raise revenue without
jeopardising the fragile recovery in the housing market.
The shift in the rate of the relief has intensified expectations that
mortgage interest relief will be abolished altogether in the coming years.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: The big winners and losers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONE PARENTS will be relieved to hear that the government has made up to
Pounds 28 a week available to those on family credit to help pay for
childcare. The move is aimed at taking some of the sting out of recent
controversy on the government's 'back to basics' policy, which has been
criticised for its approach to single parents. While it may enable more
single parents to return to the workplace, it is questionable whether Pounds
28 a week is sufficient to pay for childcare, or even whether the jobs will
be available for those seeking them. Single parents may also benefit from
the job-seekers allowance which will offer increased guidance, assessment
and financial incentives to the long-term unemployed.
PENSIONERS were compensated for the last Budget battering by Mr Norman
Lamont. All will receive the same help with their fuel bills as those on
income-related benefits, which are set to rise by 3.5 per cent. The poorest
will receive the benefit increases as VAT is imposed on fuel, so money is
available when the bills arrive. The poorest and disabled will also receive
special increases in the income-related benefits of between 50p and 70p a
week, which will be doubled in 1995. All OAPs will also now be eligible for
financial assistance on home insulation. Meanwhile, savers will be offered a
five-year guaranteed income bond at 'a competitive rate'.
ENTREPRENEURS get a big boost with changes in capital gains tax exemption
limits when they sell a business on retirement. Complete exemptions will be
given on the first Pounds 250,000 of capital gains and a half exemption on
the next Pounds 750,000. Mr Clarke has also introduced a new tax-efficient
venture capital trust to channel savings into the unquoted trading company.
Perhaps the most surprising change allows anyone facing a capital gains
charge to defer tax indefinitely by reinvesting those gains in unquoted
companies. Finally, the enterprise investment scheme gives 20 per cent
up-front tax relief, but will also allow income and capital gains tax relief
on investment losses.
YOUNGER WORKING WOMEN will lose substantially by the decision to equalise
the retirement age at 65. Employers may welcome the decision, however, as it
eases the burden of pension responsibilities. The change will be phased in
over 10 years, starting in 2010, leaving women over the age of 44 now free
to leave work with full benefits at 60. The justification is that since more
women are now in paid employment, and since they live longer, an equal
pension age is more appropriate. Mr Clarke says the move will bring Britain
'broadly in line with most of our industrial competitors' while it will
leave women better off than their counterparts in the US, where the
retirement age is 67.
MARRIED COUPLES are likely to lose on several fronts. Most significantly,
the married couples' allowance, which had already been reduced for 1994 from
25 per cent to 20 per cent, will fall further in 1995 to 15 per cent. The
homeowner will also face a similar reduction in mortgage interest relief
from 20 per cent to 15 per cent in 1995. This is likely to add a further
Pounds 10 a month to a mortgage of Pounds 30,000, the limit at which loans
qualifying for mortgage interest relief was frozen. Insurance premiums,
which have already increased substantially in recent years, will go up by an
average of 35p a week for the typical family with home contents, motor and
buildings insurance.
HEDONISTS were big losers yesterday, or at least all smoking, car-driving
air travellers. The 7.3 per cent increase in excise duty on tobacco is high
compared with the low rate of inflation. Travellers will also be hit by the
Pounds 5 airport departure tax for flights within the EU and Pounds 10 for
other destinations. Surprisingly this hits both the business and private
traveller. Had this been introduced under VAT, it would have been
reclaimable. The vehicle excise duty on cars - the tax disc - will add
Pounds 5 a year in the immediate future, while road fuel was increased by 3p
a litre. The only good news for fun-lovers was that duties on beer and
spirits was not increased.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Typical household will pay 35p a week levy -
Insurance premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURE
A tax of 3 per cent is to be imposed on general insurance premiums for risks
located in the UK from next October.
IN DETAIL
The tax will apply to insurance such as buildings, home contents, motor,
travel, private medical cover. Long term insurance products, such as
endowments, will be exempt, as will many types of commercial insurance, such
as export credit and shipping insur-ance.
The tax will be paid by the insured, but collected by the insurer. Tax
avoidance measures such as paying premiums in advance will not be possible.
In a separate move, tax relief on private medical insurance for the over 60s
is to be limited to 25 per cent; the relief will also cover the new premium
tax. PMI contracts will no longer have to be approved by the Inland Revenue
before becoming eligible for tax relief.
THE BACKGROUND
Most other European countries already tax insurance premiums; the Chancellor
said that 3 per cent was one of the lowest levels in the EU and estimated
the levy would cost the typical household, with motor, home contents and
buildings insurance, 35p a week.

of venture capital trusts, a new kind of investment trust which would invest
in unquoted trading companies.
IN DETAIL: The Enterprise Investment Scheme will come into force on January
1. Investors will be able to put up to Pounds 100,000 a year in companies
qualifying for the EIS, which will be able to raise up to Pounds 1m a year
through the scheme.
For the tax year 1993-94, there will be a combined limit of Pounds 40,000
for investments under the EIS and BES; the new Pounds 100,000 limit will
apply from 1994-95. Income tax relief will be limited to 20 per cent, but
losses on the disposal of shares will be eligible for income tax or capital
gains tax relief, which may encourage investors to be less averse to risk.
Any capital gains within the scheme will be free of tax. Shares must be held
for at least five years.
Companies investing in private rented housing will not be eligible.
Investors previously unconnected with EIS companies will be allowed to
become paid directors while still qualifying for tax relief - this means
that 'business angels' will be able to take an active part in the management
of the company without losing entitlement to relief.
Venture capital trusts will also be free of tax on dividends and capital
gains. These trusts would not become available for a considerable time: the
chancellor plans to issue a consultation paper on the subject in the New
Year, with legislation in the 1995 Finance Act.
THE BACKGROUND: The EIS was welcomed by the investment industry yesterday as
the 'son of BES' it had been demanding. It is a direct replacement for the
Business Expansion Scheme, which ends on December 31.
The BES was launched in 1983. Intended to encourage private individuals to
invest in small, high-risk growing companies, it ended up being used largely
as a tax-efficient method for investing in rented property. The previous
chancellor announced the abolition of the BES in 1992.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Charities left unimpressed - VAT compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE
A compensation package for low-income households following the extension of
VAT on domestic fuel and power from 8 per cent from April 1994, to 17.5 per
cent in 1995.
IN DETAIL
Income-related benefits will rise by 3.9 per cent next April, which Mr
Clarke said would be 'a lot more than many people in work will get next
year'.
Furthermore, Mr Clarke promised an extra Pounds 1.25bn a year in benefits
for 15m people from April 1994. It will be apportioned in this way:
Single pensioners will receive a 50p a week increase in the rate and
pensioner couples 70p a week from April 1994 in addition to the regular
uprating of benefits. It is also intended to award the same weekly cash
increases in April 1995, taking extra overall help to Pounds 1 for single
pensioners and Pounds 1.40 for couples, weekly, amounting to total extra
help of Pounds 1.30 for singles and Pounds 1.85 for couples by April 1996.
The same benefit increases will be made for those on widow and invalidity
pensions, and those disabled people on income support.
Mr Clarke said: 'By April 1996 benefits will be Pounds 1.40 a week higher
for single poorer pensioners and Pounds 2 a week higher for couples than
they would otherwise have been.'
He also announced an increase in cold weather payments - the extra benefit
payable following seven successive days of zero temperatures - from Pounds 6
a week currently to Pounds 7 a week next winter, with a further 50p the
following winter.
Mr Clarke announced that funds for the home energy efficiency scheme, which
provides grants for home insulation, will be almost doubled, to Pounds 35m a
year for the next three years, and pensioners and all dis-abled people will
in future be eligible for the scheme.
The measure should mean an extra 200,000 pensioner households are eligible
to receive grants; more than 500,000 such grants have been made since the
scheme started in 1991.
THE BACKGROUND
Mr Clarke said that the compensation package 'will ensure that the
introduction of VAT does not put the cost of fuel beyond the reach of the
poorest in our society.'
He said the immediate impact of the new measures will mean that, for
instance, a pensioner couple on income support will have a total benefit
increase of Pounds 4 a week.
Mr Peter Jenkins, VAT specialist at Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday that
'while the extra payment takes the sting out of the tail of extending VAT to
fuel bills by helping the most disadvantaged, there is a sizeable number of
low wage-earners who will be hit very hard when the VAT jumps to 17.5 per
cent in 1995. I think there is still a lot of political flak to come on this
issue.'
For Lady Sally Greengross, director of the charity Age Concern England, the
compensation package 'is not enough. Fifty pence for a single person is only
between half and two-thirds of the amount needed to fully compensate for VAT
on fuel, and 70p for a couple is only about two-thirds of the amount needed,
and these are average figures.'
That view was echoed yesterday by the sister charity Age Concern Scotland,
whose director Maureen O'Neill said: 'This doesn't go anywhere near enough .
. . charities and retirement homes are statutorily required to keep
temperatures at a certain level; this package does nothing to help them.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Few tax changes but 20% band extended -
Allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURES
The chancellor left unchanged the personal allowance for income tax, the
threshold for higher rate tax and the income limit for the age-related
allowances.
He did not make any changes to the inheritance tax threshold and the exempt
amount for capital gains tax. Lower, basic and higher rates of income tax
remain the same as before, but the 20 per cent lower band will be extended
by a further Pounds 500 next year to Pounds 3,000, as announced in March.
The blind person's allowance, frozen for the last four years, will rise next
April from Pounds 1,080 to Pounds 1,200.
Tax relief on the married couple's allowance (and the other allowances and
reliefs linked to it) is already due to be limited to 20 per cent with
effect from next April (1994), but Mr Clarke said yesterday he will reduce
it still further to 15 per cent from April 1995.
The lower earnings limit for Class 1 National Insurance contributions is to
be raised to Pounds 57 a week and the upper earnings limit to Pounds 430 a
week, from April 1994.
The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made with
tax relief rises from Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 76,800 from April 1994.
IN DETAIL
Personal tax allowances have been frozen at Pounds 3,445 for those under 65
years old, Pounds 4,200 for those aged 65 to 74 and Pounds 4,370 for those
aged 75 or more.
The threshold for capital gains tax stays at Pounds 5,800, while inheritance
tax comes into force at Pounds 150,000, as before.
The lower rate tax of 20 per cent will apply to the first Pounds 3,000 of
taxable income, while the higher rate (40 per cent) threshold remains at
Pounds 23,700 for the fourth year.
THE BACKGROUND
There had been plenty of speculation that the Chancellor might either make
quite radical alterations to the income tax structure, or else raise the
appropriate thresholds in line with inflation, now at 1.4 per cent. However,
he left the personal taxation position largely unchanged.
Next year (1994-95) will be the third year in a row that the personal
allowance has been left at Pounds 3,445.
Mr Jeremy Hancock, senior tax manager at Price Waterhouse, said: 'The
freezing of the higher rate tax band since April 6 1991 is equivalent to
erosion in real value terms of between 7 and 8 per cent, while the freezing
of the personal allowance for the last three years is equivalent to erosion
in real value terms of 3 to 3.5 per cent.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Grants cut by 10% a year - Student loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE
Student grants are to be cut by 10 per cent a year next year and by similar
amounts for the next two years, but the total of grant and loan is to
increase by 4 per cent next year.
IN DETAIL
This measure speeds up the process of transferring the cost of higher
education from the state to individuals. The proportion of students' income
which has to be borrowed will increase dramatically. The exact figures for
next year's grants and loans have not yet been released, but rough figures
can be calculated from the government's announced percentages.
For example, students living in London currently get a grant of Pounds
2,845, and can borrow up to Pounds 940 from the Student Loans Company (or
Pounds 685 in their final year). Next year the grant will be cut by 10 per
cent to about Pounds 2,560, and the maximum loan will increase to about
Pounds 1,375, or Pounds 1,110 for final year students. See the table for
details of other areas.
If, as is the government's stated intention, the process of cutting the
grant by 10 per cent and increasing the loan is continued for the following
two years, by the academic year 1996-97 the proportion of grant to loan will
be roughly equal.
THE BACKGROUND
Student loans were introduced in 1990, and grants were frozen at the same
time. The National Union of Students says that even students receiving the
full grant and taking out the maximum loan now experience a shortfall from
real costs of living, so students borrow more from other sources such as
banks, or ask parents for help.
The Budget also cut the amount paid to universities for each student's
tuition; this may prompt some institutions to introduce tuition fees.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Retiring females match men at 65 - Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE
The female state pension age is being raised to the male retirement age of
65.
IN DETAIL
The measure will affect all women currently under age 44. The change will be
phased in over 10 years between 2010 and 2020.
THE BACKGROUND
This change will eventually result in savings to the National Insurance Fund
of Pounds 5bn per annum.
The basic state pension currently is worth Pounds 56.10 per week for a
single person and Pounds 89.80 for a married couple. The pension is built up
through payment of National Insurance contributions levied on 'band
earnings', earnings between Pounds 56 and Pounds 420 a week for the 1993/94
tax year (Pounds 57 and Pounds 430 in 1994/95).
The Government has reduced benefits under the state pension system before.
In 1980 the link with earnings inflation was severed and replaced with the
historically lower prices inflation link.
The value of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) already has
been cut for those retiring after the end of the century. Originally, the
pension was 25 per cent of band earnings based on the individual's best 20
years. After April 6 2000 the 25 per cent maximum will be reduced over a
period of 10 years to 20 per cent. Also the 'best 20 years' basis for
assessment will be replaced by average band earnings over an entire career,
which means that periods of low pay will also be taken into account and will
drag down the value of the pension.
The latter measure will primarily affect women since, due to family
commitments, they tend to spend a significant period in low paid part-time
employment.
Paul Greenwood, research actuary with William M Mercer, said: 'Women
currently under age 44, who want to retire before 65, will have to make pay
extra contributions to prevent a shortfall. This can be done by paying
additional voluntary contributions under a company scheme or by increasing
contributions to a personal pension plan.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Rules for claimants will be tightened - Benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE
The chancellor announced three changes to the benefit system which will
improve the position of some low-income families but will tighten the rules
for those claiming unemployment benefit and invalidity benefit.
IN DETAIL
The Childcare Allowance will permit low-income families to earn an extra
Pounds 28 per week without losing any income-related benefits. The
allowance, expected to come into force in October 1994, will apply to
couples and single parents who currently claim family credit to boost their
incomes. Family credit averages Pounds 42 per week but varies according to
the family's average earnings and the number of children, among other
factors.
The Jobseeker's Allowance, which cuts the initial unemployment benefit
period from one year to six months before the individual is means-tested,
will not come into effect until the 1996/97 tax year.
The Incapacity Benefit, which is expected to come into force in April 1995,
would replace invalidity benefit. The new benefit, which would be taxed in
line with other income-replacing benefits, would only be granted after
'tighter and more objective medical tests'.
THE BACKGROUND
The jobseeker's proposal was sharply criticised by John Monks, general
secretary of the Trades Union Congress. He said: 'The change in title from
unemployment benefit to Jobseeker's Allowance is a clumsy marketing ploy
which cannot camouflage the halving of unemployment benefit and the lack of
jobs in the economy.'
Industry sources estimated that the measure would reduce the unemployment
figures by 200,000.
The people likely to suffer most by the change are those who have made some
provision for savings or have received redundancy money. Under the
means-testing system, benefit usually is withheld from unemployed
individuals who have savings of more than Pounds 8,000.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said the purpose of the proposal was to
help people when they look for work. 'The Jobseeker's Allowance makes
clearer the link between looking for work and receiving benefit. We will
also be introducing a Jobseeker's Agreement requiring those receiving
benefit to specify in advance the steps they will take to find work - and
then to take them.'
In addition Mr Hunt announced three pilot schemes to assist the long-term
unemployed including a Jobfinder's Grant, which will give assistance to
people who have been out of work for two years or more when they find a job.
Details of all three proposals are expected to be announced today by Mr
Peter Lilley, social security secretary.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Easier budgeting for elderly - Guaranteed income
bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE
Introduction of a National Savings Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond for
pensioners, a five-year fixed rate investment which will pay a monthly
income.
IN DETAIL
The bond will be available to savers aged 65 and over. Interest will be paid
monthly, and gross, which has advantages for non-taxpayers on low incomes.
The bond is due to be launched in the new year with competitive interest
rates.
THE BACKGROUND
Elderly people largely dependent on income from interest on savings have
been hit by falling interest rates. This new National Savings product is
designed to provide a regular, predictable flow of income at a decent rate.
It could be seen as a replacement for 'Granny bonds'. These later became
generally available National Savings index linked certificates. In times of
low inflation a fixed rate may be more attractive.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Clarke cracks down on tax avoidance - Taxation
loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURE
A number of tax loopholes are being closed in order to tighten up on tax
avoidance. These include payment of employees in what Mr Clarke described as
'gold bars, coffee beans, cowrie shells or other exotic payments in kind' to
avoid National Insurance; the abuse of tax relief for profit-related pay; an
end to the use of shell companies to avoid payment of tax; an end to the use
of indexation to create or increase capital gains tax losses; and an end to
the abuse of funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes (FURBS).
IN DETAIL
Employers will have to pay National Insurance on payments in kind of the
type described by Mr Clarke, or vouchers representing them, from midnight
last night. The advantage to employees was that they could delay payment of
income tax on pay in this form, but this will also be stopped after the
finance bill becomes law.
Two loopholes have been closed on profit-related pay for schemes registered
from today. The percentage of salary paid to an employee under an artificial
scheme to increase the amount of PRP received by a small group of employees
can no longer be greater than for the rest of the workforce. Also, where
profits are artificially increased by salary sacrifices the company will no
longer be able to place an artificial limit on the amount of PRP.
Shell companies have been used to avoid tax by stripping a company of its
assets and leaving its tax liabilities intact through a change of ownership.
Anyone who sells a company from today where a number of conditions are
fulfilled, including a significant reduction in trade in the three years
prior to the sale, will have to pay the tax if the company does not do so.
An employee receiving benefit from today from an offshore FURBS will pay tax
at his marginal rate on the difference between what he receives and
contributions made by the employer or employee.
The change to capital gains tax indexation relief is substantial. The value
of this relief has been reduced with the announcement that CGT indexation
will be limited to reducing gains only and will no longer be able to used to
turn a gain into a loss or to create a loss if one had not been made.
However, a new loophole seems to have been opened. Investors can roll over
gains, for tax purposes, by buying shares in an unquoted trading company.
THE BACKGROUND
Payment of employees in exotica has often been used by employers to avoid
paying national insurance contributions usually for large employee bonuses.
CGT indexation has been used to mitigate tax on gains. 'The change in the
rules is not merely stopping a loophole,' said David Rothenberg of Blick
Rothenberg, chartered accountants. 'It represents a fundamental change for a
large number of individuals who, for example, might have lost money on the
sale of a second home. It has reduced the value of almost all CGT losses.'
FURBS are top-up pension schemes for higher earners. Although the employees
are taxed when the employer makes contributions, they can take out the
benefits free of tax. By establishing a FURBS offshore, the fund can avoid
paying UK tax on both income and capital gains. The chancellor's measure
prevents the employee enjoying the benefit of this tax-free roll-up.
On PRP, David Cohen of Paisner &amp; Co said: 'The ethos of a PRP scheme is that
there should be a direct link between the profits made by a business and the
extra salary paid. The chancellor has closed two loopholes which have
enabled employers to sever that link, but many companies will still be able
to use PRP to achieve significant savings.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Councils predict 'disastrous' cut in central
funding - Local authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities are to suffer a 'disastrous' cut in their central funding,
in spite of the chancellor's claim of a 2.3 per cent increase in their total
projected standard spending, according to local government associations.
The Association of District Councils, the Association of County Councils and
the Association of Metropolitan Authorities yesterday said that this amount
was merely an increase on last year's government estimate.
Councillors said a more important figure was the actual level of local
government expenditure for this financial year, estimated by local authority
associations at Pounds 42.6bn. They also pointed out that the introduction
of new responsibilities for implementing care in the community would cost
around Pounds 736m.
On this basis, the government's projected spending of Pounds 42.66bn for
next year represented a cut of more than 1 per cent, the authorities said.
They said the effects would involve the loss of jobs and cuts in services
for 'the elderly, the infirm, and children'. Several groups of public-sector
employees, including teachers and the police, are paid out of local
authority funds, although councils do not have any control over setting
their levels of pay.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, estimated that local
government will sustain a cash cut of 1.2 per cent, and pre-dicted 30,000
job losses.
No individual authority will be able to start forming a budget until the
environment department announces its plans for distributing grants, probably
tomorrow. Standard spending assessments for each authority have been
subjected to a wide-ranging review this year, which means that it is
possible some councils will receive significantly more grant next year in
spite of the low total level.
Those whose spending assessments are cut, and which try to avoid cuts in
services, will probably have to increase council tax bills.
Aggregate external funding - including business rates, the Revenue Support
Grant (paid out of exchequer funds), and various grants - is planned to rise
by only 1.7 per cent.
Local authority finance officers suggested that the new 'capping' criteria,
probably to be announced tomorrow, could be vital in determining how much
actual budgets are cut. The government can 'cap' local authority budgets
which it considers excessive. This power was introduced to prevent
unsustainably high council tax bills, but can also be used to restrict total
spending.
The new arrangements for distributing standard spending grants are expected
to involve a sharp reduction in funding for inner London authorities,
because the new arrangements will take the 1991 census figures into account.
Also, the formula for assessing local authorities' needs has been widely
attacked for over-emphasising ethnicity. Deprived northern former mining
communities with few immigrants claim that money is unfairly routed to areas
such as Leicester and inner London.
However, the local authority associations predicted that rural areas would
suffer cuts as well as inner cities.
Gross capital expenditure by local authorities in 1994-95 is assumed to be
around Pounds 8bn. This is much lower than spending in 1993-94, which was
boosted by the temporary relaxation of the rules barring spending of capital
receipts raised from council house sales. Capital receipts in 1994-95 are
projected to be around Pounds 2bn, giving net capital expenditure of Pounds
5bn.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Reforms will help fund justice - Legal system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be no increase in planned law and order expenditure to fund the
government's new criminal justice proposals, Robert Rice writes.
The crackdown on crime will be funded by maintaining previous spending plans
in full and through management reforms, a re-ordering of priorities and
private capital investment in prisons.
Spending on the police service will rise by 4 per cent next year and,
together with organisational reforms and changes in pay and conditions
resulting from the Sheehy report, could result in provision for another
5,000 officers on the beat.
Priority will be given to increasing the number of prison places. More than
2,000 extra places will be provided at existing prisons by 1996-97.
Six prisons are to to be financed, built and run by the private sector.
More than Pounds 100m will be provided over the next three years for secure
training centres for juvenile offenders. Their construction will also be
financed by private capital.
Funding for victim support will increase by 15 per cent to just over Pounds
10m next year. But there will be a cut in previously planned spending on
probation services.
Overall total planned expenditure for Home Office services will be Pounds
6.26bn in 1994-95 rising to Pounds 6.43bn in 1995-96 and 1996-97.
Details of the fundamental review of expenditure on legal services announced
by the chancellor are expected to be published within the next two weeks.
There has been a cut in the government's previous expenditure plans for
running the courts and legal aid of Pounds 43m in both 1994-95 and 1995-96.
Legal aid spending, however, will increase by Pounds 12m in 1995-96 over
previous plans and a further Pounds 106m in 1996-97.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Single regeneration budget intact - Local
authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's attack on government spending left what is now called the
single regeneration budget largely intact, Paul Cheeseright writes.
This Budget brings together inner-city spending from the departments of
environment, employment, education, trade and industry and the home office
under one heading for the first time. The provision in 1994-95 at Pounds
1.44bn has been reached by adding totals for the various departments.
The overall figure - untouched by Mr Clarke's search for economies - will
decline to Pounds 1.33bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 1.32bn in 1996-97.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Medical spending to rise by 1.6% - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 1.6bn increase in health spending in England was announced
yesterday by the chancellor, a 1.6 per cent rise in real terms.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said the increase represented a
clear commitment to health, in spite of a very tight budget.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the rise failed to take
into account the additional costs of an ageing population and advances in
medical science.
The government also announced it wanted health authorities to make savings
of 2.25 per cent this year, which would save Pounds 450m. Together with the
increase in spending, it would mean the National Health Service could treat
4 per cent more patients, Mrs Bottomley said.
One means of making the savings will be through local productivity pay
bargaining. Pay settlements would have to be modest, she said.
Mrs Bottomley said the Pounds 3bn drugs budget would continue to grow faster
than the rate of inflation. However, efforts to restrict prescribing would
continue. 'Doctors need to realise that when they sign a prescription, they
are writing a cheque,' she said.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: More funds for school inspections and opt-outs -
Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, emerged as a significant victor in
the public expenditure round, with an increase in the budget for the
education department and the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) of
6.8 per cent.
Total spending will be Pounds 10.487bn, an increase of Pounds 670m on
1993-94.
But most funds will be funnelled into Ofsted, which was set up last year and
has an ambitious plan to inspect all schools at least once every four years,
and into grant-maintained schools which opt out of local authority control.
Ofsted's spending on inspections will more than double in real terms over
the next three years. Central government spending on opted-out schools will
increase from Pounds 157m in the current financial year to Pounds 595m in
1996-97, to fund a hoped-for increase in the number of schools opting out.
Both figures angered teachers' unions, three of which are planning to
boycott next year's national curriculum tests.
In further education, Mr Patten is using funding as a weapon to help
employers in their dispute with the main lecturers' union. Several colleges
are affected by industrial action over the introduction of new contracts
which will halve annual holiday allowances. Mr Patten said he would hold
back Pounds 50m in grants from the further education funding council until
'there has been satisfactory progress within colleges towards more flexible
contracts'.
The government will continue to provide funding aimed at increasing student
numbers by 25 per cent by 1995-96, but said it would require 'efficiency
savings'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Big cuts in grants and tuition fees -
Universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher education is to be subjected to a severe regime of funding cuts. Both
grants paid to students for living costs and tuition fees paid to
universities will be cut heavily.
The decisions follow a sharp rise in student numbers. Since 1987 the
proportion of 18-year-olds entering university has more than doubled, from
15 per cent to 32 per cent.
The news is a deep disappointment for universities, which had campaigned for
the government to raise extra revenue by introducing loans to pay for
tuition which would be repaid by graduates via the income tax system.
Now, the chances that universities will have to introduce 'top-up' tuition
fees, payable by students before they start on courses, appear to have been
greatly increased.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, claimed that there would be a
reduction of nearly 3.5 per cent in the numbers entering higher education
next year 'because of demographic trends'.
He predicted as well 'a further small tightening in standards of entry'.
But the Universities' Central Admissions Service said that applications for
next year, at 180,000, were already 5 per cent higher than at the same point
last year, showing that demand was buoyant. It predicted universities would
have to raise the standards of their offers.
Tuition fees paid to higher education institutions by the government have
been cut by 45 per cent for all courses. These fees were adopted to
encourage universities to expand, gaining extra funding by recruiting extra
students. Fees for clinical medicine, laboratory-based, and classroom-based
(arts) courses have now been cut to Pounds 750 for arts courses, Pounds
1,600 for sciences, and Pounds 2,800 for clinical courses.
Student grants, to help with living costs, will be cut by 10 per cent. That
will be offset by a rise in the money available through the government's
Student Loans Company.
The total funds available to students will rise by 4 per cent.
Similar cuts will be made in the next two years, so that in the academic
year beginning in September 1996, grants and loans will be roughly equal.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: 'Shadow tolls' for private investors - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night appeared to have performed a U-turn by accepting
that it would be prepared to pay 'shadow tolls' to investors in privately
financed motorways.
A statement issued by the Treasury said that promoters of private schemes
would 'receive payments from the government in relation to the level of
traffic using the road'.
Ministers have previously rejected the use of shadow tolls, saying they
removed much of the risk from investors.
Officials said yesterday that the Department of Transport would hold 'early
discussions with the construction industry and others to identify
appropriate schemes'. The department expects to award the first contracts in
about 18 months.
In the longer term it expects to adopt a system of electronic motorway
charging as soon as the technology is ready.
The government also approved a string of schemes which it wants the private
sector to finance, build and, in some cases, operate. These included a
Pounds 600m modernisation of Britain's deteriorating west coast main railway
line.
A new Pounds 200m Scottish air traffic control centre for the Civil Aviation
Authority is proposed, to expand capacity for flights to and across Scotland
and the North Atlantic.
A Pounds 100m project will extend the London Docklands Light Railway south
from the Isle of Dogs via a new tunnel under the Thames to Lewisham. Bids
will be invited during next year with a view to opening the new service in
1997-98.
The chancellor cited the Aintree NHS Trust in Liverpool as a model of what
the government wanted. Here, the private sector will build and operate a
100-bed low-dependency patient hotel, with conference and catering
facilities in the grounds of Fazakerly Hospital.
Other private sector finance initiatives include provision for new prisons
and secure training centres.
The budget also marked a shift in the balance of public spending on
transport away from roads and towards rail and underground.
According to the department's three-year projections, spending on the
national road network will fall from Pounds 2.09bn in this financial year to
Pounds 1.96bn in 1995-96.
Spending on rail will fall from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 975m while London
Transport will rise from Pounds 722m to Pounds 930m. Over the three years,
however, spending on London Transport will be Pounds 364m less than
projected earlier this year. London Transport said it was 'profoundly
disappointed'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tough stance aims to trim Pounds 780m - Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence plans for the next two years are to be cut by Pounds 780m, a sharper
reduction than had been generally expected.
By setting a barely changed spending figure for the following year, 1996-97,
the government has set the tone for more constrained medium-term funding.
Plans for a so-called 'defence cost review' to achieve the necessary savings
are expected to be detailed today. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary,
said a 'major study would focus on ways of reducing the cost of support
services without affecting operational capability'.
The emphasis on efficiency measures rather than front-line cuts is meant to
head off the threat of a backbench rebellion. The all-party Commons defence
committee, which will question Mr Rifkind today, has warned strongly against
further cuts, arguing that they could have 'a serious effect on morale'.
Mr Rifkind said the reductions would be made in part through 'lower
procurement and employment costs' - a warning of a tougher attitude towards
the Ministry of Defence's suppliers and low pay increases for military and
civilian personnel.
The spending figures are based on the assumption that pay rises will be kept
to 1 or 2 per cent a year during the three-year period.
Mr Rifkind confirmed that savings would also come from the planned sale of
military accommodation to a private-sector housing trust. That measure is
expected to bring in up to Pounds 500m.
The proposed study into support costs, which is expected to lead to further
privatisation, was attacked by Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, as
a 'facade'. He repeated Labour's call for a full defence review.
The Budget plans are expected to reduce UK defence spending as a proportion
of gross domestic product from 3.7 per cent at present to 3 per cent in
1996-97. That would still be above the average for European Nato allies.
Defence spending in the next financial year is set at Dollars 23.49bn, close
to this year's level but an estimated 3.5 per cent drop in real terms, and
Pounds 260m less than previously planned. The budget for 1995-96, Pounds
520m lower than planned at Pounds 22.7bn, will entail a further real-terms
fall of 6.8 per cent. An additional 2 per cent reduction in real terms is
forecast for the following year.
The reductions are expected to bring further cutbacks in military
installations including the closure of one of the RAF's two bases in
Germany.
Thousands more industrial jobs could be threatened in a sector already
heavily damaged since the end of the the cold war. In the past two years
alone, large defence contractors have announced some 20,000 job cuts.
Industry fears that the threat of cutbacks, as well as a lengthy review
process, will hold back vital production orders. 'We certainly won't go
unscathed,' one leading defence manufacturer commented.
All new equipment projects are now expected to be called into question to
some degree. British Aerospace insisted yesterday that the Eurofighter 2000,
the four-nation venture which is the largest single defence programme, would
not be affected. However, when the project comes to the production phase, it
is questionable whether the UK will want its planned quota of 250 aircraft.
Cuts made earlier this year in the equipment programme included the shelving
of plans to buy new air defence missiles, worth at least Pounds 500m, and to
equip the RAF with air-launched nuclear missiles, for which a Pounds 1.8bn
provision had been made in the MoD's long-term spending plans.
Two other large aircraft contracts are overdue and may be affected by the
latest spending cuts: a mid-life upgrade for the RAF's Tornado GR1 bombers
and the purchase of up to 18 new Sea Harrier jump jets from BAe, worth
Pounds 300-Pounds 400m.
The navy which has suffered heavy cutbacks, could face yet more. Its fleet
of destroyers and frigates is set to be reduced from 39 to 'about 35' and
its four new Upholder class diesel-electric submarines, built at a cost of
some Pounds 900m, are destined to be sold, leased or mothballed. A new
helicopter carrier was ordered, but invitations to tender for the first of
two new assault ships for Royal Marine landings have been delayed.
A senior executive at one leading navy contractor commented in the run-up to
yesterday's Budget: 'I have never seen our client as anxious as now.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Builders count cost of public-sector cuts -
Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction companies were last night calculating how much public-sector
work they could have lost as a result of yesterday's cuts in planned
expenditure.
In addition to a reduction in proposed spending on motorway and trunk roads
for 1994-95 of about Pounds 145m, there were also cuts in planned
expenditure on housing.
The Institute of Housing calculated that cuts in capital and revenue
spending meant that allocations to housing associations for 1994-95 would be
almost Pounds 300m.
This meant that associations would be able to acquire 13,000 fewer homes
than would have been the case.
The institute also questioned the chancellor's assertion that associations,
by taking advantage of lower construction prices, would be able to meet
their target of 53,000 homes next year. It said this target could only be
achieved by 'slippage' by carrying forward homes acquired in the current
year into next year.
'The cuts in the social housing and roads programmes will reduce the
industry's public-sector workload before recovery in private-sector demand
is re-established,' Sir Brian Hill, chairman elect of the Construction
Employers Council said last night.
The institute also calculated that local authority spending plans for
housing, mainly on renovation, had been reduced by about Pounds 150m in
1994-95.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Companies want action not words - Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction companies faced with government spending cuts on roads and
housing will need a lot of convincing that private investment in public
infrastructure will come anywhere to making up the difference.
The more cynical regarded the chancellor's support for private finance
projects as little more than window dressing. Almost all of the schemes he
announced in his Budget speech were already well known by the industry.
The extension to Lewisham of the Docklands Light Railway, has been unveiled
as part of 'new initiatives' three times in nine months by three separate
government ministers.
Mr Patrick De Pelet, head of project finance at Kleinwort Benson, yesterday
welcomed the chancellor's encour-agement but said: 'What is needed at this
stage is some action rather than words of reassurance.'
The one piece of good news was that the government was now prepared to
consider contracts which would enable investors in roads to be repaid by the
Exchequer according to the level of traffic using the road.
Ministers previously have rejected the use of so-called 'shadow tolls' in
this way.
The industry, however, will need to see details of how this might work
before acclaiming it as a breakthrough. The Federation of Civil Engineers
said last night that it was encouraged by the move.
The experience of construction companies and bankers has been that there is
a big difference between the government approving projects and actually
agreeing terms acceptable to private sector investors.
Of the 90-odd schemes, identified by ministerial departments as candidates
for private investment, work has started on about only a dozen.
These include projects such as the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line underground
extension and the Pounds 135m Manchester Metrolink light rail system, both
of which have been almost entirely funded by the public sector.
The total invested in public infrastructure by the private sector is little
more than Pounds 1bn - more than a decade after Tarmac proposed the first
privately financed toll motorway in the West Midlands, a scheme which was
eventually built by the public sector.
The Treasury, following the scrapping of the restrictive Ryrie investment
rules, has become much more receptive to private sector plans to invest in
road, rail and other projects previously built by the public sector.
The problem has been that many of the projects planned are not capable of
being financed entirely by the private sector.
Construction of the Channel tunnel rail link is likely to require a subsidy
of Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn according to potential bidders.
A decision to grant the concession to the consortium demanding the lowest
subsidy could rebound badly on the project if this subsequently ran out of
money and had to be refinanced. Ministers for their part say that they must
get the best value for money and that means allowing companies to bid in
open competition.
Measures are being considered, however, to protect companies which invest
money and time in generating novel ideas for investment only to face the
prospect of losing the work when it is put out to open tender.
One leading contractor summed it up last night: 'I am convinced that
ministers and the Treasury want to see private schemes proceed but they
still have to come to terms that companies will expect to make a bigger
return from risk investment than they have traditionally made from normal
contracting.'

Sylvie Pierce, 45
Job: chief executive of Reading Borough Council
Earns: Pounds 65,000 a year
Politics: by law she is not allowed to say who she votes for
Preferred: to see increase in direct taxation rather than in indirect
taxation
Was bracing herself for: another round of local authority spending cuts.
'Local councils' budgets have been squeezed since the mid-1980s and we are
no exception. What is means for us is that the level of services we can
provide will fall.'
Said yesterday: 'My first reaction is one of pleasant surprise that the
Budget has been less dramatic than we have been led to expect. By this I
mean there have not been the increases on VAT predicted. But this is
tempered by the fear of what are they storing up for us in public spending
cuts.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Sick pay move worries companies - Employment
benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers' organisations and large companies expressed unease over changes
to statutory sick pay, but gave a cautious welcome to the reduction in
employers' National Insurance contributions.
But, even though the government has increased the sick pay burden for large
companies, industry warmly welcomed the implications of the package for
small companies, which will benefit both from the sick pay changes and the
NI reductions.
The Institute of Directors said it was 'concerned' over the sick pay and NI
arrangements which it believed would leave employers with a substantial
administrative load.
It said the cost of providing statutory sick pay might be met by the
reduction in National Insurance costs, but added: 'This will do nothing to
tackle the burden of complying with these changes.'
It said it would have preferred incentives for employers to have used
private health cover, offsetting the premiums against corporation tax.
It did not believe the reduction in NI costs would be an incentive for
companies to employ unskilled or semi-skilled workers: 'This is not a
deregulatory Budget,' it said. The Engineering Employers Federation was also
worried about the sick pay changes. 'I don't think our members will be happy
as the burden is being passed to the private sector,' said Mrs Anne Minto,
director of policy and practice.
'It also looks a bit inconsistent with the argument about maintaining
competitiveness against European countries by reducing non-wage costs to
employers,' she added.
IBM (UK), the British subsidiary of the world's largest computer
manufacturer, said it thought it would suffer more from the decision to stop
reimbursing statutory sick pay than it would benefit from the reduction in
NI contributions.
British Steel said it was unable immediately to calculate what effects the
sickness payment changes would have, but said they would encourage companies
to act responsibly. 'We have already moved by becoming much tougher on sick
payments,' it added.
Mr Jim Yuill, of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said the sick pay changes might
stiffen the resolve of companies to monitor sickness more closely. 'Some
companies have not been doing this as the government has picked up part of
the tab.'
However, even though the sick pay burden is shifted to large employers -
which in this case means companies with more than about 12 employees -
industry is unlikely to be too unhappy, he said.
This is because the upper limit for employees' contributions has not been
changed, so employers will not have to compensate employees for any extra
payment.
The CBI welcomed the fact that the chancellor has recognised that any
increase in the sick pay burden for industry should be recompensed by
changes in National Insurance contributions.
It also pointed out that smaller companies would benefit doubly, first
because they will receive full reimbursement of National Insurance bills
after only four weeks of each statutory sick pay claim, compared with six
weeks previously.
Secondly, small companies proportionately employ more lower paid workers -
earning less than Pounds 200 a week - than larger companies, it said. So
they will benefit more from the reduction in the lower rates of National
Insurance contributions by 1 percentage point.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Science receives a small increase - Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Science has emerged with a small spending increase. The government's new
Office of Science and Technology will have Pounds 1,082m to spend on
research in 1994-95, mainly in universities compared with Pounds 1,038m in
1993-94.
Next year's science budget is Pounds 7m more generous than the planning
figure announced a year ago.
The OST has been protected from cuts by the government's determination to
push forward the changes in science policy outlined in a white paper six
months ago.
'It's a very good settlement compared to what might have been,' said Sir
David Phillips, outgoing chairman of the Advisory Board for the Research
Councils, who has not been afraid to criticise science budgets.
However, OST officials concede that there is likely to be a small decline in
research and development spending by other government departments - as
foreseen a year ago.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Pay-freeze policy prompts union fury - Public
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's 5m public-sector workers face an almost unprecedented pay bill
freeze, lasting until 1997 under the government's plans to curb public
spending.
The chancellor said in his statement that central government running costs
'including pay bills' are to be 'frozen at this year's cash level' of Pounds
20.1bn. He added: 'Pay increases for public-sector staff will have to be
paid for by greater efficiency or savings in the cost of running
government.'
In the long history of public-sector pay restraint since 1945, no government
has attempted to freeze public-sector pay bills for three consecutive
financial years. In 1978-79 a tight 5 per cent pay policy ended in the
infamous Winter of Discontent, while public-sector pay pauses and freezes
imposed in the 1960s by governments failed to last.
Union reaction was swift and hostile. Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, associate
general secretary of Unison, the public service union, said: 'This policy is
not sustainable. You can't treat people in this cavalier fashion when the
consequence will be massive unemployment.'
The Trades Union Congress said last night: 'The outlook for the public
sector is very grim indeed. The chancellor's options in the public sector
are substantial job cuts, a continuing wage freeze, or more efficiencies
which will be extremely hard to find.'
The Budget announcement was a hardening of Mr Clarke's policy on
public-sector pay for the next financial year announced in September when it
was made clear that any pay rises for the 1994-1995 would have to be met by
efficiency savings of at least 2 per cent and from other economies.
Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation said: 'This is
unprecedented and it marks a substantial extension of the government's
public-sector pay policy. The longer the policy lasts, the harder it will be
to sustain. It will undermine public-sector morale, encourage labour
turnover and widen enormously the earnings gap between the public and
private sector.'
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said last night that he was holding
back Pounds 50m in grants from the Further Education Funding Council until
there had been 'satisfactory progress within colleges towards more flexible
contracts of employment'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Labour market reforms aim at better targeting -
Analysis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The package of labour market reforms, like the government's broader social
security reforms, is all about the more accurate targeting of benefits and
incentives to reflect the realities of a more complex and differentiated
labour force.
Burdens will, however, be carried by the employed, the unemployed and
employers.
Entitlement to unemployment benefit is being cut by six months for
employees, and both sickness and invalidity benefits are being focused more
tightly. Larger employers will have to shoulder a higher proportion of sick
pay costs.
Most of the themes and policy instruments are familiar: improving work
incentives; reducing non-wage labour costs for employers, especially for the
longer-term unemployed; improving vocational training.
There was also a broad hint from the chancellor that he wants the unemployed
to be dealt with by one department rather than two, the Department of
Employment and the Department of Social Security, as at present. He
announced there would be a single benefit for the unemployed called the job
seeker's allowance.
Why was there so much tinkering with the labour market when unemployment is
cruising steadily downward? Partly because it is likely to remain
unacceptably high, and expensive, at more than 2.5m for a long time. There
is also concern in the government about how high unemployment is dampening
recovery.
The government claims that the fall in unemployment has come unexpectedly
early thanks to its own labour market reforms. But given that the recovery
now seems to have begun in the middle of last year, the fall in unemployment
came nine months later, about the normal time-lag.
At present about two-thirds of the unemployed are back at work within six
months, so will not be affected by the cut in unemployment benefit from 12
to six months.
Unemployment benefit - Pounds 44.65 for a single person - is currently
received by all unemployed people for 12 months regardless of savings or
other incomes coming into their household. Anyone who has savings of more
than Pounds 8,000 or a partner in work gets nothing after unemployment
benefit runs out, but about 70 per cent of the unemployed receive
means-tested income support.
Some of the better-off, professional unemployed will not be hit by missing
six months of unemployment benefit. But others, especially low-income people
with a working partner, could be badly squeezed, and it might create an
incentive for that partner to cease working.
The effect of the change in benefit could be to knock about 100,000 people
off the unemployment register, mainly the better off. But the move could
also increase pressure for more comprehensive support measures for the
unemployed after six months in the form of a guaranteed job or quality
training.
Sceptics will argue the main thrust of the government's policy is to force
people off the unemployment register. The government will say it has acted
to improve training and job prospects for the unemployed, with its new
training apprenticeship and cuts in national insurance contributions for
low-skilled jobs to make it more attractive for employers to take on the
long-term unemployed.
The latter changes should help to deal with the long-standing anomaly that
national insurance is considerably higher as a proportion of the total wage
for the lower-paid, lower-skilled workers who form most of the long-term
unemployed.
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, is expected to
recommend something similar next week at a meeting to address the EU's
unemployment crisis.
In other respects the government is extending policies, such as the Restart
course, which have proved successful. The childcare allowance recognises
that many women are trapped at home because of the cost of childcare.
For employers' costs the picture was a mixed one.
The government boasts about the low non-wage labour costs for employers in
the UK compared with most other EU countries, but in several areas it has
been quietly pushing them up. The latest area to be hit is sick pay. Smaller
companies will be protected and large companies left to bear the brunt of
the costs.
Employers are also suspicious of the funding of the new apprenticeship
scheme. Another attempt to improve Britain's poor record in vocational
training has been welcomed, but the government needs to prove that there is
substance behind the comforting concept of apprenticeship.
The apprenticeship scheme is not primarily about reducing unemployment -
joblessness in the 18 to 25 age group is falling faster than the 25 to 50
group.
But the fear that unemployment can become the habit of a life-time means
that 18- to 25-year-olds are getting privileged treatment with a doubling of
the Community Action places to 95,000.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Hill farming grants fall Pounds 25m in fresh
round of cuts - Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hill farmers will take the brunt of cuts in agricultural spending for a
second year running, under plans announced by the Ministry of Agriculture
yesterday.
The ministry said that hill livestock compensatory allowances (HLCAs), paid
to 67,000 farmers in difficult areas covering half of the UK's farmland,
would be reduced by Pounds 25m to Pounds 105m next year. This follows a cut
of Pounds 20m in the current year.
Ministry officials argue that hill farmers' net incomes have risen on
average by 70 per cent in real terms over the past two years, thanks largely
to the devaluation of the 'green pound', the artificial exchange rate used
to translate EU subsidies into sterling.
This has pushed up the value of those subsidies sharply and also increased
British meat exports, raising domestic prices.
Some hill farmers will receive as much as Pounds 27,000 in direct subsidies
this year, the ministry estimates. National subsidies are being reduced as
support from Brussels rises.
The National Farmers Union said that the boost from devaluation had merely
taken real incomes back to the level of 1988. Average hill incomes were
still less than Pounds 10,000 or 60 per cent of the national average wage,
it said.
'It's a body-blow for farmers in what is an extremely difficult sector,'
said Mr David Naish, the union's president. 'Selective cuts of this kind
will not only have a devastating impact on the working of hill farms but
also on the landscape and rural economies.'
Overall domestic agricultural spending will be Pounds 40m lower than last
autumn's plans of Pounds 1.08bn, compared with Pounds 1.11bn this year. The
Common Agricultural Policy portion of the Budget will be Pounds 130m higher
than planned at Pounds 2.64bn.
Apart from the HLCAs, about Pounds 12m will be cut from a grant scheme to
help farmers dispose of waste. Agricultural research funding will also be
cut.
A Pounds 30m three-year programme to encourage environmentally friendly
farming will be launched as planned next year, but with a delay of several
months in payments to farmers.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Job help for single parents - Childcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new childcare allowance, worth up to Pounds 28 a week, will be introduced
this autumn in a measure which will enable more people, particularly single
parents, to take jobs.
Single parents have recently been central to the government's review of
welfare spending.
The allowance will be available to those on Family Credit, a supplement paid
to low wage earners. The level of assistance depends on an individual's
wages and on how many children there are in a family.
People can be eligible who earn up to Pounds 180 a week. There are now about
420,000 beneficiaries.
The chancellor said the new allowance 'should help tens of thousands of
mothers to get back into work and off income support'.
The Campaign for Tax Relief and Childcare welcomed the new measure for
families on Family Credit but criticised the chancellor for failing to
increase employer-funded childcare and to 'provide practical childcare
solutions for thousands of working parents.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Arts cuts less severe than expected - Heritage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to spend Pounds 4.5m on fire-prevention measures at
royal palaces in the wake of the recent fires at Windsor Castle and Hampton
Court.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, seems to have fought his
corner well against the Treasury's attempts to reduce public expenditure in
1994-95. The national heritage department's budget for the year will be
Pounds 976m, compared with Pounds 955m in 1993-94.
The biggest projected victim was the Arts Council, which a year ago was told
it faced a 2 per cent reduction in its 1994-95 grant. It will now receive
1.69 per cent less. The Arts Council of England will have about Pounds 3.2m
less to distribute in 1994-95.
Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, said: 'This is a black day for
the arts and a national disgrace. This is a needless budget cut which will
inflict disproportionate harm on the arts.'
The full council will meet in mid-December to decide whether to share the
reduction in grant equally among its clients, or whether to concentrate its
reduced resources on certain art forms and companies.
About Pounds 1m will be spent on London's Albert Memorial, which has been
under protective wraps for several years. The government is also providing
Pounds 3m towards the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Sick pay changes - Employment Benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Making large companies meet the full cost of the sick pay of their employees
will cut government spending by Pounds 700m a year, said the chancellor.
Under his proposals companies with national insurance bills totalling less
than Pounds 20,000 will be fully reimbursed after four weeks.
This is a relaxation of the system under which companies with national
insurance bills of less than Pounds 16,000 a year are fully reimbursed after
the first six weeks of each sick pay claim.
'This means for well-managed companies with low sickness rates there will be
a net reduction in the cost of employing people,' he claimed.
The chancellor also said that from next April national insurance
contributions are to be cut by 1.0 per cent for any long-term unemployed
looking for unskilled or semi-skilled low paid work.
Overall the chancellor calculates that the cuts in national insurance
contriubutions will reduce the overall cost to employers of job provision by
Pounds 830m next year rising to Pounds 1bn by 1996-97.
This he said was 'well above the overall cost to employers of the reform to
statutory sick pay'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Switch to system based on resources - Govt
accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far-reaching changes in the way government departments and agencies prepare
their accounts announced by the chancellor could encourage a much more
businesslike approach to the management of the nation's finances.
Early next year, the Treasury will publish details of a switch in government
accounting procedures from the present cash-based system of budgets voted
annually by parliament to a resource accounting framework which should allow
ministers to take a longer view of their spending programmes.
This will involve drawing up the sort of accruals-based accounts familiar in
the private sector, the health service and some executive agencies. It will
also require activity-based costing and the preparation of proper management
accounts.
'A resource accounting framework will help ministers understand the real
costs of their decisions,' said Ms Elizabeth Ransom of KPMG.
The switch should stop ministers deciding to make savings which incur
considerable costs in later years, according to Mr John Wynn of Price
Waterhouse.
'Saving money on things like maintenance now can come back to haunt you in
five years' time,' he said.
In a resource accounting framework, expenditure represents the cost of
resources consumed each year, taking into account the depreciation of assets
and the cost of capital, and changes in the level of creditors and stocks.
Income represents what is received each year, taking into account changes in
the level of debtors.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tecs hail work training scheme - Apprenticeships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new apprenticeship scheme to put work-based training on a par with
academic qualifications will gradually replace the Pounds 700m a year Youth
Training as the main scheme for 16-19 year olds.
The announcement yesterday gave only a very broad framework for the scheme,
the bones of which will be created in discussions over the next few weeks
between the Employment Department, employers' bodies and Training and
Enterprise Councils which will administer it. Tecs yesterday said they were
'delighted' by the initiative.
The Confederation of British Industry said it was pleased but it would have
to examine the detailed funding arrangements before being able to fully
endorse the scheme.
the
The new apprenticeship, which echoes Mr Major's policy of going back to
basics, will cost about Pounds 1.25bn over the next three years, taking up
much of the YT budget. It will be on offer to up to 150,000 young people at
any time.
The new apprenticeship will seek to train young people to National
Vocational Qualification level 3, a higher level than the NVQ level 2 that
is presently gained by most young people on YT.
Total planned expenditure at the Department of Employment's programmes next
year will be Pounds 3.770 million, including a transfer to the department of
Pounds 117 million for the Careers Service, compared to Pounds 3.625 million
this year.
Tecs, which administer YT and Training For Work, said they believed their
budgets would be cut by about Pounds 100m and that TFW would be the main
victim.
However, Tecs said new flexibilities, including arrangements that will offer
them a three year licence guaranteeing their core administrative funding,
went some way to mitigate the Budget effects.
Mr Hunt said 18-25 year olds will have priority access to Community Action,
that pays Pounds 10 extra to unemployed people taking up voluntary and
charitable programmes.

Miranda Thomas, 29
Has two small children. Husband, Martin, is a solicitor and they live in the
west London two-bedroomed flat they bought in 1990 for pounds 131,000. They
have just sold it for pounds 108,000. But the total loss is much greater
than the pounds 23,000 it appears. The couple took out a pounds 75,000
interest-only mortgage when interest rates were 15 per cent. After paying
the building society for four years, they still owe pounds 85,000
Job: part-time teacher at Camden School for Girls
Earns: Pounds 7,000 a year
Wanted: tax relief on childcare. She has to pay a childminder for two and a
half days a week. Did not want: to see MIRAS disappear, but felt it would be
unrealistic to expect interest rates to be cut further
Verdict: 'I was pleased with the new allowance for childcare for people on
family credit. But it's a pity it doesn't go further, especially after all
the talk of getting women back to work. We knew the cut in mortgage tax
relief was coming. The interest rates are more important to us.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Travel industry fears package holiday blow -
Airport excise duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The introduction of a new excise duty on passengers departing from UK
airports angered airlines and the package travel industry and led to fears
that British tourism would be damaged.
The chancellor announced that from October 1 next year, air passengers from
the UK will be charged Pounds 5 for flights to British and European Union
destinations and Pounds 10 to go elsewhere. The only travellers exempted
from the tax will be children aged under two travelling free, passengers on
aircraft with fewer than 20 seats, transit passengers and those making a
return journey on a return ticket within the UK.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, objected to air travellers
being singled out. He said: 'Why should road, rail and sea travellers be
exempt? This decision makes air travel less competitive against other forms
of transport. Britain's airlines form a world-beating industry. They deserve
better, as do the millions of business and leisure travellers who now face
higher fares.'
Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, said: 'It will mean higher
fares for everyone at a time when UK airlines have been working hard to keep
fares down.'
The British Tourist Authority said that overseas and domestic travellers
were already paying Pounds 2bn in value added tax and customs and excise
duty. 'Anything that puts the price of travel up will make us less
competitive.'
The package-tour industry said their business would be badly affected by the
tax. Mr Wesley Pentland, president of the Association of British Travel
Agents, said: 'The demand for package holidays is very elastic and
experience has shown that a small increase in price can cause a fall in
demand three time larger.'
Abta said it was relieved, however, that the duty would not take effect
until next October. This meant most of next summer's programme would be
unaffected. The industry will not have to make a decision on whether to
absorb or pass on the cost to travellers until they come to sell holidays
for winter 1994-95 and summer 1995.
Thomas Cook, the travel agents' chain, said the level of holiday prices in
summer 1995 would depend as much on the level of competition in the package
holiday industry at that time as on the new tax.
The Tour Operators' Study Group, which represents 80 per cent of the package
tour operators, said it would be attempting to get the government to
withdraw the duty, which, it said, had been introduced without consultation.
There was anger too that the duty, to be collected by Customs and Excise,
will apparently go into general government coffers and will not be used
specifically to improve travel facilities.
While the precise form of the duty surprised the travel industry, many were
expecting some new form of tax on travel. Some thought the government would
introduce value added tax on all domestic travel, but wondered how this
would affect the rail privatisation programme. Few believed that value added
tax would be imposed on airline fares only.
Although Sir Colin and Sir Michael warned against VAT on air travel, Mr
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, conceded the industry should
have lobbied harder to avoid a new tax. He said: 'Since the long-haul
carriers never even conceived the government would tax tourism we never
campaigned to stop it.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Dogged lobbying by drinks industry pays off -
Analysis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unchanged rates of duty on beer and spirits reflect the success of intense
lobbying by the industries.
The brewers - which last night delightedly welcomed their first Budget
relief for five years - had mounted a powerful campaign to persuade the
chancellor that any increase in beer duty, after the 1.5p a pint rise in
March, would increase the damage already being done to the industry by
cross-Channel shopping.
The increase in personal imports of duty-paid beer from France is already
estimated to account for about 12 per cent of the UK's take-home market;
equivalent to about 700,000 barrels a year or the output of a large brewery.
Loss of revenue to the Treasury this year is expected to amount to Pounds
130m on legitimate imports alone - but smuggling is also believed to be
growing.
The brewers warned that any increase in beer prices above those prevailing
in Continental Europe would further stimulate cross-Channel trade.
They claimed, too, that continual increases in duty, up by 31 per cent in
real terms since 1979, had contributed to the 25 per cent decline in beer
sales through pubs during the same period.
Beer duties had already been increased twice this year - by 5 per cent in
the March Budget and by a further 2.7 per cent from a change in the duty
collection system in June which the government had promised would be
fiscally neutral.
The chancellor acknowledged the strength of these arguments yesterday.
The chancellor's St Andrew's Day decision to continue the standstill on
spirits duty introduced in March was welcomed by the Scotch Whisky
Association.
The 2p increase on a bottle of wine, however, was dubbed as 'irresponsible'
by the Wine and Spirits Association. It would lead to increased
cross-Channel shopping to the detriment of UK retailers, it said.
Cross-channel imports also weighed less heavily than health factors in the
chancellor's treatment of cigarettes.
The Tobacco Advisory Council described the 11p per packet increase, on top
of a 10p increase in March, as 'outrageous.' It added: 'The country's 17m
smokers, who already pay Pounds 23m a day in tobacco taxes, are being used
to make up the Treasury's shortfall.'
ASH, the anti-smoking organisation, welcomed the decision as 'very helpful
to health'. It could reduce demand for cigarettes by 2bn a year and
eventually save 2,500 lives a year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax rises and fuel duty hit drivers - Motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of motoring will rise significantly as a result of a sharp increase
in fuel duties, a further rise in the cost of the car-tax disc - the vehicle
excise duty - as well as the imposition of the new insurance tax which will
increase the cost of car insurance.
Petrol and diesel prices are set to rise well above the rate of inflation
for the foreseeable future, as the government yesterday committed itself to
raise road fuel duties by at least 5 per cent a year in real terms, compared
with the increases of at least 3 per cent a year announced in March's
Budget.
Duties on road fuels were raised by 3p a litre or 14p a gallon with effect
from 6pm last night. This effectively raised the price of unleaded petrol by
6.5 per cent to around Pounds 2.36 a gallon, while the price of a gallon of
diesel rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 2.40 and the price of 4-star petrol rose
by 5.5 per cent to around Pounds 2.59.
The price of the car-tax disc is to be raised from Pounds 125 to Pounds 130,
and this follows the increase of Pounds 15 from Pounds 110 in the March. The
vehicle excise duty on trucks is unchanged.
Motoring organisations last night attacked the increasing tax burden on
motorists.
'What motorist can be happy with an annual increase in motoring taxation
totalling 20 per cent ..and the prospect of paying to use the motorways?'
the Automobile Association said last night.
According to the AA, the Budget has given motorists an extra bill of around
Pounds 44 a year on top of the tax increases in March for an average
motorist covering 9,000 miles a year at 35 miles per gallon.
The chancellor claimed falls in oil prices meant that petrol would still
cost less in real terms than in the early 1980s.
Some 80 per cent of goods are moved by roads and this cost can be expected
to rise by about 1.5 per cent as a direct result of yesterday's Budget.
The Road Haulage Association, which claims to be operating on wafer-thin
margins, warned last night that its 10,000 member companies had every
intention of passing on the cost increase in full.
But with the exception of this adverse effect on the economy as a whole, the
motor trade and industry was quietly breathing a sigh of relief.
The increase in fuel duty was bigger than expected, but not big enough to
cause any significant slowing of the recovery in new vehicle markets which
is helping lift the country out of recession.
Nor, most industry analysts felt last night, would any damage be done by the
other small burdens Mr Clarke imposed on the business vehicle sector, the
higher car excise duty and a 6 per cent rise in the taxation scale charges
for fuel provided to company car drivers for their private use.
In terms of the car market, the most likely impact will be further to
accelerate the increase in popularity of diesel cars, which are at least 25
per cent more economical than their petrol counterparts.
Mr Clarke did not even bother to mention the scale charge increase in his
Budget speech. At its worst, it increases the charge for a car of over two
litres from the current Pounds 1,130 to to Pounds 1,200 from next April 6 -
representing an increased payment of only 34p a week to a basic rate
taxpayer.
The company car industry had feared greater changes, notably the possible
introduction of National Insurance Contributions by employees to an entirely
new company car taxation regime.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax may raise premiums on vehicles and homes -
Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Disappointing but in some ways inevitable,' was how Royal Insurance, one of
the country's biggest insurance companies, summed up the impact of
yesterday's decision by the chancellor to impose a 3 per cent tax on
insurance premiums.
The tax, which will apply to most general insurance where the insured risk
is located in the UK, comes into effect next October and is expected to
yield Pounds 775m in its first full financial year. Life and pensions
business, reinsurance, and insurances such as marine, aviation, reinsurance
and export credit are exempt.
Reaction yesterday was muted, partly because the tax brings the UK into line
with practice in most of Europe and the US. 'We stuck out like a sore
thumb,' says Mr Roy Randall, head of corporate relations at Royal Insurance.
However, insurers are concerned about the burden of administering the tax.
They say it could have an impact on premiums for both home and motor
policies bought by individuals and commercial policies bought by companies,
at a time when the industry had been hoping for greater stability following
rate increases over the past two years.
'The cost will need to be passed on to policyholders,' warned Mr Mark
Boleat, director-general of the Association of British Insurers.
However, a number of companies indicated yesterday that they would try to
absorb the extra costs by increasing efficiency. The Prudential, which
provides 2m customers with household insurance, was quick to issue a
statement insisting that it was 'determined not to pass on' the new tax to
its customers.
Mr Barry Holder, general manager, finance at General Accident, the
Perth-based composite insurer, said 'the cost is likely to fall on us
initially. We'd assess it alongside other costs and see whether it was
necessary to increase rates'.
Others predict the tax could lead to fewer people buying insurance. 'It will
inevitably lead to a considerable increase in the number of under or
uninsured,' warned Mr Colin Czapiewski, an insurance specialist with
actuaries Lane, Clark and Peacock.
Insurers can at least take heart from the fact that the 3 per cent rate
compares favourably with premium tax rates elsewhere in Europe, which vary
from 2 per cent in the Republic of Ireland to as much as 30 per cent on some
French fire insurance policies.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Beer unchanged - Duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in five Budgets, the duty on beer is not increased and
spirits duty is also unchanged. But wine and cider prices go up from January
1 in line with inflation.
The changes add 2p to a 75cl bottle of table wine and 4p for sparkling wine.
Cider goes up 1p for a two-litre bottle.
The chancellor estimates that the revenue changes on drinks will have only a
negligible impact on the retail price index.
Duties on tobacco went up from 6pm yesterday.
The price of 20 cigarettes, raised by 10p in the March Budget, rose a
further 11p to around Pounds 2.52p.
The price of five small cigars rose 5p and of 50 grams of pipe tobacco by
14p on a 7.3 per cent increase in duty.
The price of hand-rolled tobacco went up 32p for a 50-gram packet.
Tobacco duty will be raised each year from now on by an average of at least
3 per cent a year in real terms.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Miras cuts signal gradual phasing out - Banks and
building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest impact on retail financial services companies in the Budget
emerged in measures further to reduce mortgage interest tax relief, and to
introduce a new fixed-rate national savings bond for pensioners.
Banks' distant fear that the government might impose a form of 'windfall'
tax on their recovering profits proved unfounded. This meant that they were
most affected in their expanding role as mortgage lenders.
Building societies said the restriction of mortgage interest relief to 15
per cent from April 1995 - following the cut to 20 per cent from next April
announced in the March Budget - was a further signal that the relief would
eventually be phased out.
However, most lenders said the measure did not disrupt the faltering
recovery in the housing market as much as some had feared.
They also welcomed the fact that a gradual phase-out would avoid sharp
movements in the market, such as the surges in demand that have taken place
in the past.
The introduction in the new year of the new National Savings Pensioners
Guaranteed Income Bond giving pensioners a fixed monthly income for five
years could signal further pressure on societies' retail funding, which is
already stretched.
However, Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society, and one of the strongest past critics of National Savings
products, said that he believed societies would be able to compete with the
bond.
National Savings said that the bond would be introduced in line with 'market
rates prevailing at the time of the launch' in the New Year. Mr Longhurst
said that as long as this was true, the market for retail funds would not be
distorted.
'If they are talking about it being at the market rate, I would ask if it
will be a good deal for pensioners to fix their savings rate for the next
five years when most people believe rates are at a low point,' he said.
Mr Brian Davis, operations director of Nationwide Building Society, said it
would be 'churlish' to criticise the Budget too strongly when Mr Clarke had
not introduced measures that would disrupt the short-term housing market
recovery.
He said that the measures to restrict mortgage interest relief had been
postponed by a year, which would allow borrowers to adjust gradually.
Societies also welcomed the fact that social security payments were not
altered.
Lloyds Bank said that it now seemed that mortgage interest relief would be
phased out in the long term.
The government was right, it said, to implement this in stages rather than
distorting the market by setting a single date.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Statutory audit ends for small companies - Audit
exemptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to half a million companies will be exempted from the need for an annual
statutory audit, under proposals unveiled by the Chancellor yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Clarke announced in his Budget speech that all of the 300,000
companies with a turnover below Pounds 90,000 will no longer require any
external verification of their accounts.
He also said 'most' companies with a turnover of between Pounds 90,000 and
Pounds 350,000 - totalling a further 200,000 businesses - will in future
only require an independent accountant's report to verify that the accounts
correctly reflect its books.
The new procedures will replace a mandatory audit by a regulated auditor of
all of the more than 1m limited liability companies in the UK demanded by
current legislation.
The action follows substantial lobbying for reform by small business
organisations and much of the accountancy profession itself. They argued
that the audit was costly and nonsensical.
But the exemption limits proposed by Mr Clarke are much higher than
expected: Pounds 350,000 a year is the threshold for cash accounting under
the VAT system.
A consultation document issued by the Department of Trade and Industry in
April suggested lifting the requirement for companies below the value added
tax registration threshold, currently a turnover of Pounds 37,600 a year.
The Inland Revenue previously opposed removal of the audit, but officials
were persuaded under Treasury pressure that they did not place much greater
reliance on audited accounts than the equivalent unaudited figures from
unincorporated businesses of similar size.
Mr Henry Gold, technical director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales, which called for abolition of the audit for companies
with turnover below Pounds 350,000, said: 'We are delighted the government
has gone all the way. This . . . brings us a bit closer in line with just
about everyone else in the world.'
The change will prove unpopular with credit-rating agencies and other users
of financial information who have said that they rely on a full audit to
verify company accounts.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, which has many members
acting as accountants to small companies, said last night: 'We are concerned
that removal of the audit requirement will also remove accountability for
some organisations. We believe that this may give rise to concerns with
regard to the public interest.'
The DTI is expected to issue further details of the proposals early next
year. Its consultative document in the spring came after two attempts in the
past few years to remove or relax the small company audit requirement.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Credit insurance cover rises to Pounds 3.2bn -
Export finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's addition of Pounds 200m to export credit insurance cover
for capital exports in 1996-97, and a cut in the cost of premiums for
certain markets, was yesterday welcomed by exporters as 'a step in the right
direction'.
Credit cover from the Export Credits Guarantee Department, the government
agency responsible for medium and long-term insurance cover, will rise from
Pounds 3bn in 1995-96 to Pounds 3.2bn in 1996-97.
This is in addition to provision in October of extra short-term export
insurance cover worth Pounds 1.4bn for the remainder of 1993 in a move aimed
at protecting Britain's export drive in fast-growing markets, particularly
in the Pacific rim.
'In that this additional cover gives more headroom, it is most welcome,'
said Mr Campbell Dunford, chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce's
export committee.
He was encouraged by 'a gathering awareness' of the importance of exports.
Premiums for credit cover for exports to Argentina, India, Mexico, Poland,
Slovakia and Turkey are to be cut by 'up to 20 per cent'.
This move has also been welcomed, though exporters complained that rates to
markets such as Argentina and Poland have in the recent past been up to
three times more expensive than other export credit agencies.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Publishers and retailers united by 'relief
factor' - Value Added Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Consumer Industries Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's decision to leave value added tax unchanged was welcomed by
many industries yesterday - and by none more enthusiastically than
publishers of newspapers, books and magazines, food manufacturers and makers
of baby clothes.
All these sectors had lobbied hard against the ending of the zero-rated VAT
status of their products, which, they argued, would have dampened demand,
reduced profits and even driven some companies out of business.
There was relief among retailers that the chancellor had ruled out an
increase in the standard rate of VAT, which could have damaged consumer
confidence during the Christmas season.
Mr James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, said there
could be a 'relief factor' among consumers who had put off spending because
of Budget uncertainty.
Publishers were pleased by the continuation of zero-rating on reading
material, though several fear the VAT issue may return.
Mr William Sitwell of the Periodical Publishers' Association said: 'The
fight will have to continue.'
Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, said that if 17.5
per cent VAT had been imposed, national newspapers would have lost 10 per
cent of sales and two titles might not have survived. The Publishers'
Association said book sales would have fallen 15 per cent.
The Food &amp; Drink Federation said the continued zero-rating of almost 80 per
cent of food products was 'good news for consumers and the economy' and
would particularly benefit poorer people.
The Confectionery Consortium for Fair VAT, backed by chocolate makers
Cadbury, Mars and Thorntons, expressed disappointment. The companies had
wanted VAT to be extended to all food at a special rate of about 8 per cent,
to end alleged discrimination against confectionery, which is taxed at the
standard rate.
Retailers and the textile industry, meanwhile, were celebrating the
chancellor's decision not to extend VAT to children's clothing.
Storehouse, the retail group which owns BHS, Mothercare and Blazer, said
such a move would have been 'bad news for our customers and not terribly

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Applause greets 'best Budget in years' - Small
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The business community yesterday warmly welcomed a package of measures that
many see as the best Budget for small and growing companies in years.
Business groups said it was cleverly targeted at helping existing businesses
to grow and would attract much-needed private equity capital into unquoted
companies.
The announcement that the government was considering legislation to give a
statutory right to interest on over-due payments was greeted by the Forum of
Private Business as 'the single best thing that could have been done for
small business'.
Supporters of this legislation say it would change the whole culture
surrounding late payment of suppliers and would remove a damaging drain on
growing businesses's cash positions at a time when they are struggling to
find debt finance.
Welcoming a more targeted replacement for the discredited Business Expansion
Scheme, the British venture capital industry said more risk capital would
become available for the UK's entrepreneurs.
In particular, investors in Enterprise Investment Schemes - as the successor
to BES will be called - will be allowed full capital gains tax roll-over
relief on gains made on the sale of quoted investments which are then
reinvested in unquoted companies. Property investments will be specifically
excluded, closing one avenue that was greatly abused in the BES scheme.
Venture capital companies also welcomed the proposal to set up venture
capital trusts, in which private investors would be exempt from capital
gains tax and income tax. This will be introduced in the 1995 Finance Bill.
These two measures may also attract much needed knowledge from business
'angels' who will now be able to invest their money and their expertise.
'The chancellor is once again giving individuals an incentive to put money
into unlisted companies,' said Mr Michael Walton, head of Venture Capital at
Gartmore.
Of the more immediate benefits for existing companies, business groups
particularly welcomed changes to the thresholds below which companies pay
the small business tax rate.
The Chancellor raised the threshold below which companies pay a 25 per cent
tax rate from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000. There were other issues that
will have an immediate benefit on small company cash flow.
The chancellor modified the transitional relief scheme for the uniform
business rate; instead of facing a 15 per cent or 20 per cent per annum
increase in the rate, depending on the company's size, companies will now
only face a 7.5 per cent or 10 per cent increase.
There were other measures that will have an immediate effect on cashflow.
The Chancellor has raised the level for full reimbursement of statutory
sickness pay from those companies paying Pounds 16,000 in national insurance
bills to those paying Pounds 20,000. Companies will also be repaid within
four weeks instead of the current six weeks.
Small companies administrative costs could also fall. The threshold for
administering VAT will rise from sales of Pounds 37.600 to Pounds 45,000,
allowing 75,000 more companies to drop out of the net, the Chancellor said.
This threshold rise gives the lie to previous government claims that
Brussels was preventing an increase in the threshold.
Plans to integrate National Insurance and PAYE collection could also help
cut administration costs.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: FIDs given guarded welcome - Advance corporation
tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor is pressing ahead with the foreign income dividend scheme
(FIDs) outlined in the March Budget, designed to help companies save surplus
advance corporation tax (ACT).
But he surprised some by allowing the continuance of enhanced scrip
dividends, a device where companies pay dividends in shares rather than cash
thereby avoiding paying ACT in the first place. Companies could continue to
use enhanced scrip dividends rather than opt for FIDs.
The new FID scheme will take effect for dividends paid on or after July 1,
1994.
Companies gave a guarded welcome to the scheme, saying it was a step in the
right direction, but still contained imperfections. They intend to keep up
the pressure for more to be done to reduce the surplus ACT mountain.
Surplus ACT has become a sizeable problem, with the Inland Revenue
estimating it now totals Pounds 5.5bn and is rising by Pounds 700m a year.
Companies complain that this is in effect an interest-free loan to the
government.
Companies pay ACT on their dividends, and later offset it against their
mainstream corporation tax bill. But if their tax liability is insufficient
to offset the ACT paid, the surplus ACT remains in the hands of the
exchequer. The FID scheme will help companies which earn a high proportion
of profits overseas, which do not create a large enough UK corporation tax
liability.
In March, the Inland Revenue issued a consultative document about the
scheme. Some changes have been made following representations.
Under the scheme, companies can opt to pay a FID out of foreign source
profits. Originally companies were required to match the dividend in an
accounting period to the foreign profit in the same or immediately
succeeding accounting period. That has now been changed to include the
current and previous year, and, if those provide insufficient foreign
profits, subsequent years.
Although grateful for this change, companies yesterday pointed out that this
would still not allow them to use up the backlog of surplus ACT.
Many companies had suggested they should be allowed to 'stream' dividends,
directing FIDs - which do not carry a tax credit for tax-exempt investors -
towards tax-paying shareholders while continuing to pay normal dividends to
tax-free investors such as pension funds. This has not been allowed.
Tax-free investors, which often make up a sizeable part of a company's
shareholder register, face losing 20 per cent of their dividend income if
they receive FIDs, because of the absence of a tax credit, and may put
pressure on companies to increase the dividend to offset that loss.
The scheme has also been slightly loosened with regard to international
headquarter companies, in an effort to increase the attractiveness of the UK
as a base for companies, for instance the European headquarters of a US
multinational. These will not have to pay ACT on dividends at all, if they
have no more than 20 shareholders, and at least 80 per cent of the shares
are held outside the UK.
The Inland Revenue estimates it will gain Pounds 30m from the FID scheme in
1994-95, as the reductions in tax credits paid come before any repayment of
ACT; it will break even in the following year; and the scheme will cost
Pounds 100m in 1996-97, with the figure rising thereafter. The earlier
estimate of a Pounds 200m-cost a year has been reduced as corporate
profitability is expected to rise, so reducing surplus ACT.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Ministers fail to act on debt mountain - Late
payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will have disappointed thousands of British businesses in
failing to take immediate action to tackle the Pounds 50bn mountain of
overdue commercial debts.
The government wants more time to examine the issue, despite a vociferous
lobbying campaign - particularly by small businesses - aimed at pressuring
ministers into introducing legally backed penalties for late-payment.
Although the chancellor acknowledged that failure to settle on time could
mean 'the difference between survival and failure' for many UK companies,
ministers remain unconvinced about the value of legislation.
A consultative document setting out the arguments for legislating to
introduce a statutory right of interest on late payments was published
yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry. Interested parties will
have until the end of March 1994 to respond.
But the document makes clear that ministers still have reservations about
the value of statutory interest.
They have consistently pointed out that while legally backed penalties for
late payers exist across much of Europe, the late payment problem still
persists in most countries. There are also concerns that late payment
penalties could themselves threaten the solvency of small companies
hard-pressed to pay on time.
As a result, the consultation paper also examines the alternative arguments
for supporting a voluntary approach to the issue, in which government and
big business are expected to lead by example. The Confederation of British
Industry, which says late payment threatens the survival of one in five
companies, has introduced a prompt payers code.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Offshore funds may prove a temptation - Unit
trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposed changes to the tax rules that apply to authorised
unit trusts, saying that his intention is to put investors who receive
interest indirectly through such a trust in the same tax position as if they
received the interest directly.
However, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds argued that the
proposed measures would place onshore bond and money market funds at a
disadvantage vis a vis offshore funds. The proposals could also encourage
investors to invest directly in overseas equities rather than through pooled
investment vehicles, the Association said.
In future, the rate of corporation tax paid by authorised unit trusts will
be the same as the basic rate of income tax. This reverses changes made in
the Finance Act 1993 whereby it was planned to lower corporation tax from 25
per cent to 22.5 per cent in 1993-94 and then to 20 per cent.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the association, said the proposal to
raise corporation tax to 25 per cent 'produces a situation where bond funds
offshore (which sell their products to UK investors) are at a tax advantage
because the investors are only taxed at 20 per cent'. He warned that this
might drive more bond funds offshore. Foreign investors, however, will be
able to receive interest from UK funds gross.
Mr Warland said investors investing directly in overseas shares will be
taxed at 20 per cent, compared to 25 per cent if they buy through a unit
trust.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Changes benefit retail investors - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual investors will benefit most from the Chancellor's efforts to
clarify the tax treatment of some futures and options products.
Under the changes announced in the Budget, investors buying an options
contract for which they make an upfront payment called a 'premium', will be
able to offset the cost of this against capital gains tax. This applies to
cash-settled options bringing them into line with rules that already apply
to similar instruments.
Futures industry officials say this takes away a current disincentive for
individual investors to invest in derivatives, but is not likely in itself
to entice waves of new investors into the industry.
In addition, the chancellor announced a review of the taxation of interest
in an attempt to remove anomalies between the treatment of derivatives and
their underlying instruments.
Other measures taken in the derivatives sector were largely technical
clarifications of the treatment by companies of foreign exchange and futures
and options gains and losses in advance of new regulations which are due to
be published later in December.
'This is a very sensible move and reduces risk for the professional
operator, but it is not going to encourage retail investors to use options
until they can understand them,' said Mr Charles Fry, chairman of Johnson
Fry, which runs a Pounds 4m futures fund.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Big business gives its verdict
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Bonfield
Chairman, ICL
'This was the most entertaining Budget in recent years. We hope the
confident delivery will add to confidence in the UK economy.
The reduced PSBR should improve international confidence in the UK, thus
increasing the opportunity for lower interest rates.
The overall package for small business will be helpful. We also welcome the
government's further encouragement of private-sector involvement in the
provision of public services, and the proposed changes in public-sector
accounting are long overdue.
The chancellor assumes that inflation will remain low and the economy will
grow. This is clearly a calculated bet on the future. Let's hope he is a
good betting man.'
Jon Walden
Managing director, Lex Vehicle Leasing
'I'm delighted with the chancellor's forward-thinking Budget, which has
finally recognised the importance of the motor industry in economic recovery
by deciding not to increase substantially its tax burden. We're pleased in
particular that there are no further changes to the company car taxation
scheme due in April, such as requiring National Insurance contributions for
employees.
Other increases such as that on fuel and the ad valorem tax on insurance
premiums are roughly in line with expectations. And we're pleased to see
that there will be no introduction of road pricing until the proper
technology is available.
Overall, a Budget which should allow the fragile recovery to continue.'
Sir Denys Henderson
Chairman, ICI
'This is a skilful Budget and I believe that it should be welcomed by
industry.
The substantial phased reduction in the PSBR should assure the markets and
limit the risks to the recovery against the background of the cut in
interest rates.
The measures to encourage small business are to be welcomed and particularly
the schemes to increase venture capital investment. I also welcome the
higher education spending and the adults' apprenticeship scheme. Industry
has wanted this for a long time.
The chancellor's strategy depends on lower interest rates, lower inflation
and strict control of public expenditure and that is in the government's
court.'
Sir Barry Duxbury
Director, Society of British Aerospace Companies
'These spending cuts will probably take another 5,000 to 10,000 people out
of direct employment in the defence sector and will have an inevitable
spin-off effect on indirect jobs linked to the industry.
We feel that the Treasury has failed to appreciate the significant
contribution the defence and aerospace industry makes to the overall
economic wellbeing of the country. It makes an enormous contribution to
exports and the balance of payments. Many civil projects also depend on that
expenditure.
Bringing together the MOD and the DTI on the issue of R &amp; D support for
aerospace would be an important step forward: you can't run this industry in
a vacuum between two ministries.'
Geoffrey Whalen
Managing director, Peugeot Talbot
'The vital thing was for the chancellor to protect the recovery by avoiding
further substantial tax increases. This he appears to have done and to that
extent the motor industry will be pleased.
But motorists will be disappointed that the 3 per cent insurance tax will
put up their costs. They will also be annoyed that tax on petrol and diesel
has been increased by substantially more than previously indicated.
This may help government revenues but, if a prime purpose of the fuel tax
increase was to reduce CO2 emissions, he should have reduced the tax on
diesel.
Motorists will also await with trepidation plans for electronic motorway
charging.'
Malcolm Taylor
Managing director, Bridgeport Machines
'I am very disappointed that no measures were announced to stimulate the
economy by increasing investment.
Fiscal policies such as low interest rates are not enough on their own to
stimulate investment, and we had thought that both the Treasury and the
Department of Trade and Industry accepted that. But the chancellor did
nothing to extend the two-year temporary 40 per cent capital allowance.
Employers will look at the apprentice training scheme with great interest
and are likely to view it positively. The move to discourage late payment of
bills is also a good thing, although it is difficult to know how it will
work in practice.'
Joe Dwyer
Chief Executive, Wimpey
'On the face of it, this appears to be a relatively neutral Budget for
construction - not worse and perhaps slightly better than expected.
On MIRAS, the proposed cut is not dramatic and may even encourage some
people to bring forward their home-buying plans.
The sharpest pain will come from overall capital spending cuts of 10 per
cent over the next two years. These will heighten the industry's
difficulties, given our over-dependence on public investment until private
investors regain confidence.
But if the chancellor puts real muscle behind his commitment to
private-public sector initiatives, this is most encouraging - if only for
the longer term.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Clarke tackles arcane mysteries - Analysis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chancellor announced a number of proposals which will affect companies'
corporation tax.
Foreign Income Dividends
He confirmed that the Foreign Income Dividend (FID) Scheme first announced
in the March Budget will be introduced. Companies making the election will
still be required to account for ACT on FIDs, but any surplus ACT paid in
respect of a FID will now be recoverable.
The shareholder receiving the FID is to be treated as having received income
that has borne tax at the lower rate of 20 per cent, but basic rate
taxpayers will not suffer further income tax on the dividend.
But two classes of shareholders will be disadvantaged by the proposals. The
dividend will not carry a tax credit, which normal dividends do, so that
tax-exempt investors will not be able to reclaim any tax in relation to a
FID, and overseas shareholders will not be able to benefit from any
arrangements in Double Tax Treaties that enable repayment of all or part of
the tax credit.
While consultation following the announcements in March have resulted in
some improvements, the Chancellor has not accepted that dividends can
'streamed' between FIDs and normal dividends.
Effective streaming can now only be achieved by having different classes of
shares, and finance directors and investors are unlikely to be attracted to
that idea.
Proposals for international headquarters companies will be a major benefit
to international groups that have wished to establish a European holding
company in the UK, but deterred, as so many have been by the UK rules on
ACT.
Tax haven companies
The Chancellor announced an amendment to the tax treatment of Controlled
Foreign Companies that will reduce the opportunities for tax planning.
Non-trading CFCs are able to avoid a CFC charge if they meet the acceptable
distribution test.
This has previously required the company to distribute 90% of its accounting
profits (less capital gains). However, the CFC charge is based on profits as
adjusted for tax purposes.
Companies were able to exploit the differences between accounting and
taxable profits to reduce the impact of the CFC rules. It is proposed that
for accounting periods of a CFC that end on or after 30 November, the
acceptable distribution test will be based on taxable profits, so
eliminating the opportunity for planning. The Inland Revenue estimate that
the measure will yield an additional Pounds 50m in tax.
Company residence
The definition of company residence in UK legislation differs from that in
double tax treaties. This causes difficulties where, under UK domestic
rules, a company is treated as resident here, but is not resident for the
purposes of the treaty.
Some companies have exploited this distinction, for example enabling them to
benefit from UK reliefs for losses under UK domestic legislation, even
though profits may not be taxable because of the terms of the treaty.
The Chancellor announced that for accounting periods beginning on or after
Budget day, where a company is treated as non-resident for treaty purposes,
it will also be treated as non-resident for UK purposes.
Capital allowances
The Chancellor announced proposals to stop 25% capital allowances being
claimed on buildings that were said to constitute plant.
There is no statutory definition of plant, and the courts have, in recent
years, been increasingly sympathetic to claims from taxpayers that buildings
and other structures that performed a function in relation to the trade, and
were not only the setting in which the trade was carried on, were really
plant.
Consultation on the Corporation Tax treatment of interest
The Inland Revenue will undertake a review of the tax treatment of interest
paid and received by companies.
The Corporation Tax treatment of interest can be very different from the
accounts treatment of the same interest, and is founded in legal based
distinctions between capital and revenue.
The uncertainty causes problems in determining the correct tax treatment and
timing of interest paid and received, both within the UK, and when
considering the tax treatment of payments of interest into and out of the
UK.
The review will attempt to identify how to remove these inconsistencies, and
uncertainties, and are a welcome attempt to eliminate some of the more
arcane mysteries of the UK tax system.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: How the chancellor views economic prospects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's forecast of faster UK growth next year builds on a better
than expected economic performance over the past six months. Although there
is a widespread belief that Britain is still in recession, and some sectors
such as construction are still very depressed, the country has been in
recovery since the second quarter of last year.
Seasonally-adjusted unemployment has fallen by 137,000 from its January peak
of 2.99m. Gross domestic product in the third quarter was 1.9 per cent
higher than the year before. Inflation, with the retail prices index up 1.8
per cent in the year to October and RPI excluding mortgage interest payments
2.8 per cent higher, is around its lowest levels for 25 years.
Official figures have shown a slow down in the growth of industrial
production since the spring while consumer demand has remained strong.
Strengthening the UK's productive capacity remains a long-term challenge for
Britain's policy makers.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Government bond prices given boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bond prices were boosted yesterday by the chancellor's
announcement that there would be a Pounds 6.8bn reduction in official sales
of gilt-edged stock during the next 18 months, because of a policy change
announced in the last Budget, Conner Middelmann writes.
The long-dated gilt futures contract rose sharply, from 115 25/32 just
before the speech to close at 116 5/8 . It rallied further to 116 29/32 in
after-hours trading.
In the March Budget the then chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, announced that
sales of gilts to banks and building societies from 1993-94 onwards would
count towards the funding of the borrowing requirement in the same way as
sales to other institutions.
He also announced a second measure designed to help the government fund its
borrowing requirement. He said that any gilt sales to banks and building
societies which had already been made in 1992-93 would be used to reduce
funding requirements over the following two to three years - though at that
stage it was not known how much had been sold to these institutions.
Mr Clarke said yesterday that Pounds 6.8bn had been raised by gilt sales to
banks and building societies in 1992-93. He added that none of this had yet
been used in the government's current funding operations.
As a result, gilt sales between now and the end of 1994-95 will be Pounds
6.8bn lower than would otherwise have been the case, he said.
'This was the announcement that kick-started the market yesterday,' said Mr
Chris Anthony, gilts analyst at UBS.
Lowering next year's gross gilt issuance by Pounds 6.8bn 'reduces the risk
that things will go sour', he added, meaning that the government could
otherwise have had difficulty making gilt sales.
Funding for the current financial year has gone relatively smoothly, with
some Pounds 43bn of the total Pounds 50bn PSBR covered so far.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Clarke committed to erasing budget deficit by
year 2000 - Medium-term outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget announced yesterday differs markedly from its March predecessor
in its medium-term projection of a steady fall in the public sector
borrowing requirement from Pounds 50bn this year, almost to zero by the end
of the decade.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's explicit commitment to erasing the budget deficit is
based both on projections of lower public spending - as well as a
significant increase in revenue - and also on a slightly more optimistic
picture of the medium-term prospects for the economy.
Mr Norman Lamont, the previous chancellor, had forecast a progressive but
more modest fall in the PSBR to 3.75 per cent of GDP by 1997/98.
The Treasury's Red Book forecast yesterday that the economy would grow by an
average of 3 per cent per year over the medium term, and that inflation as
measured by the GDP deflator would drop to 2 per cent by the 1998/99 fiscal
year from 4 per cent in 1994/95. In March, it had predicted average economic
growth of around 2.5 per cent, and inflation expectations were almost the
same as yesterday's.
Retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments is forecast to
rise slightly to 3.25 per cent next financial year from 3 per cent this
year, but then to drop steadily to 2 per cent by 1998/99. The Treasury said
spare capacity would continue to exert downward pressure on inflation.
The Treasury noted that 'the pace at which the PSBR declines will depend
significantly on the growth of the economy over the medium term'.
It said that if the economy were to grow faster than expected, by an average
of 3.5 per cent per year in the medium term, the PSBR would be eliminated by
1997/98. But if it grew by an average of 2.5 per cent, the PSBR would still
be 2 per cent of GDP in 1998/99.
Spending cuts and substantial tax revenue increases both contribute to the
rapid projected fall in the PSBR.
The measures announced yesterday reduce projected public spending by Pounds
3.6bn in the next financial year and Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2.9bn in the
following two years respectively, compared with plans announced in the March
1993 budget.
They also raise expected revenue from taxes and national insurance
contributions by Pounds 1.7bn, Pounds 4.9bn and Pounds 6.1bn in the next
three financial years respectively.
The Treasury projects that general government expenditure as a percentage of
GDP will fall from 45 per cent this year to 41 per cent in 1998/99.
It noted that spending as a proportion of the economy, which had been on a
downward trend for much of the 1980s, has risen in recent years because of
the recession. It is now projected to fall from 1994/95 onwards.
These reductions are accompanied by significant cuts in the expected amount
of interest to be paid on government debt from 1994/95 onwards. In that
year, interest is forecast at Pounds 22.5bn, Pounds 0.8bn lower than
previously forecast. The figures for succeeding years of Pounds 24.5bn,
Pounds 25.6bn, Pounds 26.5bn are respectively Pounds 1.3bn, Pounds 2.5bn and
Pounds 3bn lower than previously forecast. For 1997/98, interest is
projected at Pounds 27bn.
The Treasury said, however, that public sector debt as a proportion of GDP
would continue to rise, and would peak at 44 per cent before beginning to
fall in 1997/98.
On the revenue side, the Treasury forecasts that general government receipts
as a pro portion of GDP will rise from 36 per cent of GDP this year to 40.25
per cent in 1998/99.
The Treasury said the economic recovery, as well as previously announced tax
increases, should reverse the recent fall in government receipts as a
proportion of the GDP. Corporation tax, for example, had halved as a
proportion of GDP during the past four years. 'This should be reversed in
the upswing, albeit gradually given the lags in tax collection and
assessment.'
Big increases in tax revenues will start to appear in 1995/96, according to
the Treasury's projections. Taxes on income, expenditure and capital are
forecast in that year at Pounds 220bn, compared with Pounds 212bn projected
in the March Red Book.
By 1997/98, this measure of tax revenue is forecast at Pounds 254bn, a
Pounds 13bn increase from the March estimate.
For 1998/99, total tax revenue is forecast at Pounds 341bn, and total
government spending at Pounds 345bn, giving a general government borrowing
requirement of Pounds 4bn. But after taking account of borrowing by public
corporations, the PSBR would be only Pounds 2bn.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Economy expected to show gradual recovery -
Forecasts for next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A picture of an economy picking up steam slowly but perhaps unevenly next
year was painted by the government yesterday in forecasts accompanying the
Budget statement.
The forecasts also suggested a slight rise next year in inflation, chiefly
caused by tax rises, and a significantly lower public sector borrowing
requirement.
The government also predicted that the current account deficit will be more
comfortably under control than had been envisaged in its previous forecasts
issued in March.
Inflation was seen as remaining subdued, however. The retail price index -
excluding mortgage interest payments - was forecast to rise from 3 per cent
this year to 3 1/4 per cent next.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, predicted 1994 growth of 2 1/2 per cent -
at the bottom of the range expected by most private forecasters  - after an
expected growth rate this year of 1 3/4 per cent. This year's growth has
been faster than the 1 1/4 per cent forecast by the Treasury in March.
Excluding expanding oil output from the North Sea, 1994 growth was forecast
at 2 1/4 per cent.
The economy has grown steadily - by 2 1/2 per cent - in six successive
quarters since the trough of the recession that the Treasury now says
occurred in the first quarter of 1992. That was, Mr Clarke noted, well
before sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September
last year.
However, this picture of steady recovery might change. 'While the recovery
so far has been remarkably smooth, it would not be surprising if the profile
of output were more uneven from now on,' the Treasury said in the Red Book
which goes with the Budget.
Next year, as in this, consumers will continue to play a key role in the
continuation of economic expansion. Consumer spending should expand 2 1/4
per cent in the coming year, after its expected 2 per cent growth this.
Government consumption - flat this year - should grow by 1 per cent, while
investment is predicted to grow by 3 per cent next year after its sluggish
expansion this year of  1/2 per cent.
Robust export growth - 5 3/4 per cent against 4 per cent this year - is also
foreseen in 1994, while the pace of import expansion should pick up to 5 1/4
per cent compared with 2 per cent.
The Treasury left unchanged its estimate for the normally-volatile public
sector borrowing requirement for the current financial year at the Pounds
50bn forecast in March. However, there was a marked drop forecast in the
PSBR for 1994-5: as a result of Budget measures and the economic recovery,
it is seen as likely to fall to Pounds 38bn in 1994-95.
Many economists in the City of London viewed Mr Clarke as having credibly
paved the way for a significant drop in government borrowing while managing
to avoid puncturing a fragile economic recovery.
Mr Neil Mackinnon, of Citibank, said the tax increases proposed in the
budget 'can be absorbed by the economy without undermining the
sustainability of the recovery'. Inflation also looked encouraging, given
that there was no extension of the scope of value added tax.
Others, however, saw the budget as implying a significant tightening of
fiscal policy, which suggested the government was too sanguine about growth
prospects - unless further interest rate cuts were on the way.
Mr James Barty, chief UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, cut his forecast for
1994 growth to 2 per cent, saying that yesterday's budget and the previous
one in March had together 'designed a headwind for the UK economy'.
That would be surmounted only by further cuts in interest rates and a
competitive exchange rate. Mr Roger Bootle, economist with Midland Global
Markets, concurred that 'the Bank of England might want another half per
cent cut in interest rates . . . soon.'
The government forecasts show the Treasury was unduly pessimistic in March
in predicting a current account deficit of Pounds 17 1/2 bn for the current
year and of Pounds 18 1/2 bn (annualised) for the first half of 1994.
The deficit for 1992 was revised down to Pounds 8bn (from the Pounds 12bn in
March). 'Despite a fallback in the invisible surplus and stronger growth in
the UK than in Continental Europe, our main export market, the current
account deficit is expected to increase only slightly in 1993. It is
forecast to be Pounds 9 1/2 bn in both 1993 and 1994.' The numbers may also
have been influenced by a newly-introduced system of recording trade with
the European Union.
The Budget measures included spending cuts for the coming year of more than
Pounds 3 1/2 bn, Mr Clarke said. Mr John Shepperd, UK economist at Yamaichi,
the Japanese investment bank, described the Pounds 3.6bn cut as a 'rabbit
out of the hat but one has to ask whether it is achievable.'
Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of research at Charterhouse Tilney, said the
spending reductions were credible in that 'government expenditure is more
cyclical than had been allowed for in March.' For example, unemployment had
fallen faster than expected.
The Treasury said the recovery so far has been accompanied by a labour
productivity performance 'which was abnormally strong for a cyclical
downturn, perhaps reflecting the effects of labour market reforms.'
While the recent drop in unemployment was associated with slowing
productivity growth, non-oil productivity was still 3 3/4 per cent up on a
year earlier, and manufacturing productivity in the third quarter was 5 per
cent up. 'As the recovery becomes more established, annual productivity
growth could fall further from its recent high rates,' the Treasury said.
The Chancellor outlined two main risks to what he described as encouraging
prospects for 1994. The first was continuing weakness of world economic
activity, particularly in Europe.
'What manufacturing industry needs most is a pick up of activity in the rest
of Europe', he said.
The second major risk was the public finances. 'The overriding need is to
place the public finances on a sound footing. That is the immediate task of
the government and the main theme of my Budget today,' he said.
The government forecasts assume oil prices are assumed to average Dollars 17
a barrel.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Cut of Pounds 60m brings harmony closer -
Scottish non-domestic rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish businesses are to have their total non-domestic rates bill cut by a
further Pounds 60m as a result of the Budget, as part of the policy of
gradually harmonising non-domestic rates in Scotland with the uniform
business rate in England and Wales. The process entails reducing Scotland's
higher levels of business rates to the lower English levels and has been
going on since 1989.
It involves periodic injections of money from the Scottish Office to offset
the revenue which local authorities would otherwise forego with the lower
rates income. In Scotland the Scottish secretary sets each council's
non-domestic rates poundage.
Since 1989 the non-domestic rates burden in Scotland has been reduced by
Pounds 500m. With yesterday's announcement, four more of Scotland's 65
councils will join the three whose rates had already fallen to English
levels.
The gap remaining to be filled after the Budget comes into effect should be
about Pounds 70m.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday that he was contributing
Pounds 47.5m of the Pounds 60m reduction to the councils. They will be
expected to save Pounds 12.5m through efficiency measures to achieve the
Pounds 60m reduction for the rate payers.
Mr Lang said yesterday's reduction in rate poundages was Pounds 10m greater
than it would otherwise have been, thanks to Scotland's Pounds 10m share of
the overall reduction in business rates announced by Mr Clarke in the
Budget.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Strategy wins broad welcome - City reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading economists in the City and in industry gave a broad welcome to a
Budget that aimed to cut public borrowing without harming the economy.
Adjectives such as 'constructive', 'sound' and even 'bold' were voiced in
response to the policy measures announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor.
He gave relatively few economic forecasts, but these were generally in line
with economists' own predictions. He was more cautious on the prospects for
growth this year and next than other forecasters, but his inflation
predictions were in line with others.
Economists voiced some concern, however, over the large element of deferred
taxation - cuts in mortgage relief and the married couples allowance should
together generate some Pounds 1.7bn in 1995. One economist described the
deferrals as a 'gamble on recovery'.
There were also questions raised over whether Mr Clarke would be able to
achieve the proposed Pounds 3.5bn in spending cuts in the coming year.
The chancellor gave little guidance on inflation. He said it would remain
within the government's target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and the prospect
of a 2.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product next year was less than
some outsiders' estimates.
However, the increased tax burden of Pounds 1.75bn in the coming year was
lighter than many had predicted and offset by higher-than-predicted public
spending cuts of Pounds 3.5bn.
Mr Clarke gave a solid commitment to slashing the government's debt burden
to Pounds 38bn next year and reducing it by a further Pounds 17bn over the
following two years. This compared with a consensus that the PSBR would fall
to Pounds 40bn next year.
Much of the PSBR reduction is expected to stem from lower inflation and a
reduction in interest rate payments.
Mr David Owen, UK economist for Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank said:
'The markets will like it. It doesn't impact on economic growth and yet
reiterates the commitment to getting the public sector borrowing requirement
down.'
Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of forecasting at the Confederation of British
Industry, applauded the restrained tax increases and the identification by
Mr Clarke of European recession as the main barrier to recovery.
Mr Richard Freeman, the chief economist for ICI, said: 'I thought the
forecasts were very sensible especially the projection for 2 per cent growth
within the OECD. 'The view that growth will be around 2.5 per cent is well
in line with our expectations.'
Mr Neil Mackinnon of Citibank said: 'As far as the Treasury's economic
forecasts are concerned they are in line with our projections. The net tax
increase can be absorbed by the economy without undermining the
sustainability of the recovery and the inflation profile also looks
encouraging given the absence of an extension to VAT.'
However, he added, the tax increases due in fiscal 1995-1996 would
'certainly tend to dent growth'.
Mr John Shepperd, UK economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese investment bank,
agreed: 'Lamont tied Clarke's hands by imposing a deferred tax of Pounds
6.7bn. This is Lamont Mark Two and if he pulls it off he'll be a hero but it
represents a fairly massive increase in personal tax.
'The Pounds 3.5bn in spending cuts was the rabbit out of the hat but one has
to ask whether it is achievable.'
Mr Roger Bootle, economist with Midland Global Markets, said: 'This was a
bold Budget which was tougher and more imaginative than the markets had
expected. The increase in tax this coming year taken together with Mr
Lamont's proposals will take Pounds 8.5bn out of consumer's pockets.
Whatever the governor of the Bank of England might want, another 0.5 per
cent cut in interest rates is needed soon.'
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist with SG Warburg, said: 'We would approve of
the growth forecast of 2.5 per cent.'
He said his main worry ahead of the Budget was that consumer confidence
would be dented, but he believes that is now unlikely to happen.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Invalidity benefit scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Invalidity benefit is to disappear and be replaced by a more tightly
controlled incapacity benefit aimed strictly at those genuinely incapable of
work.
Alterations to invalidity benefit in the Budget had been widely expected. It
had become one of the fastest growing social security benefits - over the
past 10 years numbers of people claiming it have risen from 700,000 to 1.5m,
with expenditure doubling in real terms to Pounds 6bn a year. This was set
to reach Pounds 8bn by 1995-96.
Ministers have increasingly expressed the view, repeated by Mr Kenneth
Clarke yesterday, that the benefit was being claimed by 'many people who are
not genuine invalids'.
The new benefit, to be introduced in April 1995, will replace both
invalidity benefit and sickness benefit. Incapacity benefit, unlike
invalidity benefit, will be taxed, bringing it into line with other income
replacement benefits such as retirement pensions.
Mr Clarke said the new benefit will be subject to a 'tighter and more
objective medical test'. This may bring the government into conflict with
the medical profession. The British Medical Association conference this year
angrily rejected government suggestions that an over-lenient approach by GPs
was fuelling the rapid growth in invalidity benefit.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Help for elderly averts rebellion - Pensioners'
aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor appeared to have averted the possibility of a backbench
rebellion over VAT on fuel with the announcement of his compensation package
for all pensioners irrespective of whether they are on income support.
It was warmly welcomed by backbenchers concerned about the government's
decision to press ahead with its plan to impose VAT on domestic fuel at 8
per cent in April and 17.5 per cent the following year.
Sir John Hannam, secretary of the powerful 1922 backbench committee,
expressed his relief that the chancellor had widened the compensation
package to all pensioners. 'That was what people were really concerned
about,' he said.
His prediction there would be little trouble from backbenchers over the
package was underlined by comments from some of the more independently
minded Tory MPs with trenchant views on the subject.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, (Macclesfield), said that while he would have
preferred the government to have changed its decision to impose VAT on
domestic fuel, he was nonetheless pleased with the compensation.
'It is rather better than expected since the chancellor has agreed to give
assistance to pensioners who are not on income support,' he said.
Mr Winston Churchill, (Davyhulme), said: 'The key thing is that the people
who have saved over the years are going to get help with their fuel bills.'
Ms Edwina Currie, (Derbyshire South), commended the chancellor for
'political astuteness' in widening the compensation to include all
pensioners.
Conservative backbenchers also welcomed the further special increases for
poorer pensioners and the disabled.
Criticism of the package was left to Mr John Smith, Labour leader, who said
the compensation was 'not adequate' since pensioners would get only half the
extra cost.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: 'Son of BES' to boost investment - Small
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor has attempted to stimulate equity investment in small
companies by setting up a successor to the controversial Business Expansion
Scheme (BES), and proposing a new scheme to encourage venture capital
investments.
His measures were welcomed by banks that have provided the overdraft and
short-term debt finance which has been used as a substitute for equity by
small companies.
Many had called for the chancellor to devise a 'son of BES' scheme. The
Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) announced in the Budget will follow the
BES in offering income tax relief on equity investments in unquoted trading
companies, but will exclude investments in private rented housing.
The BES, which is due to end in December, was originally limited in the same
manner, but became discredited after it was extended in 1988 to private
rented housing schemes, and turned largely into a tax avoidance vehicle.
It will also include a measure to encourage 'business angels' who introduce
finance to small companies by letting them become paid directors of the
companies they invest in without losing tax relief.
Mr Clarke's second measure to encourage equity investment - following
criticism from banks and small business groups that small companies are too
dependent on short-term finance - is to encourage a new form of venture
capital trust.
He is to issue a consultation paper in the new year which will propose a new
type of investment trust that would invest a big proportion of assets in
unquoted companies. Investors would gain tax relief on dividends and capital
gains.
Mr Clarke emphasised in his speech that the venture capital trust would
allow investors to limit the risk of investing in what is traditionally an
unstable market by diversifying their risk across a portfolio of small
companies.
The EIS will provide income tax relief at 20 per cent up to a maximum of
Pounds 100,000 a year and companies will be able to raise up to Pounds 1m a
year. The Exchequer estimated that EIS would cost Pounds 10m in the next
financial year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Basic jobless allowance cut to six months -
Targetting the unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rationalisation of benefits for the unemployed around a new Jobseeker's
Allowance from 1996 formed the centrepiece of a series of employment-related
changes in the Budget.
In its basic form the allowance will last for only six months - compared
with 12 months for the present unemployment benefit - and recipients will
have to genuinely seek work. Claimants will be expected to enter into a
Jobseeker's Agreement setting out in advance the steps they intend to take
to find employment.
Other budget measures include replacement of invalidity benefit, which
ministers believe is being abused, with a new incapacity benefit for people
who are genuinely medically incapable of work. It will be subject to a
stricter medical test than invalidity benefit.
A new allowance of up to Pounds 28 a week will help people on family credit,
particularly single mothers, to meet childcare costs and find jobs.
Also, each of the lower rates of employers' National Insurance Contributions
will be reduced by 1 percentage point as an incentive to companies to create
more unskilled and semi-skilled jobs.
Unemployed people currently receive unemployment benefit, income support or
sometimes both. Mr Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor, said the replacement scheme
would draw a 'much closer link between the receipt of benefit and the
claimant's demonstrated willingness to look for work.'
It will do so by strengthening the principles of Restart - arrangements
introduced in the mid-1980s under which long-term unemployed people are
called to interviews on their efforts to find work. This can lead to offers
of help in developing job seeking skills or other assistance.
The decision to pay the new benefit for only six months was criticised by
the government's political opponents and anti-poverty campaigners. But Mr
David Hunt, Employment Secretary, stressed that two-thirds of people
eligible through their National Insurance Contributions for an allowance
were likely to have left unemployment within six months.
'Those who are still unemployed after six months will be eligible for the
allowance on a means-tested basis, as will people whose needs are not
covered by the contributory personal allowance.'
Three new pilot schemes aimed at long-term unemployed people seeking work
were also announced by the government yesterday. A Jobfinder's grant will
provide assistance for people who have been out of work for more than two
years when they start a job.
New job search and assessment courses will be available for 18-25 year olds
who have been unemployed for more than a year.
Another scheme, for 18-25 year olds, will test the value of giving
unemployed young people their own case workers to help them plan paths out
of unemployment.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Heating aid broader than expected - Compensating
for VAT on fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The package of measures to help low-income households with the higher
heating bills which will follow the extension of VAT to fuel and power was
extended more widely than many critics had expected.
In addition to providing extra payments for those on the lowest incomes who
receive means-tested benefits, the package includes an unexpected boost to
the basic state pension paid to almost all retired people. More than 15m
people will be included - including some relatively affluent pensioners.
The package was also sweetened with a new national savings investment for
pensioners which will provide them with a guaranteed - if unspecified -
monthly income over five years.
Cold weather payments, paid to pensioners, families with young children and
disabled people on income support during sharp spells of cold weather, will
rise from Pounds 6 a week to Pounds 7 from next winter and to Pounds 7.50
the following winter. And an extra Pounds 35m a year is to be put into the
Home Energy Efficiency Scheme which provide grants to insulate homes. The
scheme, currently limited to those on income support, will be extended to
all pensioners and disabled people.
The cost of the package will be Pounds 416m in 1994-95, following the
imposition of VAT on domestic fuel at 8 per cent on April 1 1994. When the
rate rises to the full 17 1/2 per cent level on April 1 1995, the cost of
the compensation measures will increase to Pounds 897m, and will reach
almost Pounds 1.3bn in 1996-97.
These figures are at the top end of estimates of what Mr Peter Lilley, the
social security secretary, would win from the chancellor.
The aid package was welcomed by some charities for the elderly, but Age
Concern warned the extra money would not be enough to compensate for higher
fuel bills.
Scottish charities and pressure groups have already claimed that VAT on fuel
will particularly affect people north of the border and that the poorest 10
per cent of the population will be hit seven times harder than the richest
10 per cent.
At the heart of the package are increases in social security benefits in
advance of the higher fuel bills. Normally, benefits would rise only after a
year of higher bills, in the annual uprating in line with prices.
All single pensioners will get an extra 50p a week from April 1994, in
addition to the normal uprating. Married couples will get 70p a week. A year
later, there will be the same increases again when VAT on fuel rises from 8
to 17 1/2 per cent.
The same increases will be paid to widows and those on invalidity benefit.
Those on means-tested income support who are not pensioners will receive
higher increases in April 1994 and 1995 to compensate for higher fuel
prices.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Global warming curbs finalised - Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget has filled in the final piece in the UK's plans for meeting
international commitments to curb global warming, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, said yesterday.
Annual 5 per cent real increases on fuel duty are the main measure to help
curb emissions of carbon dioxide. The government has also given an extra
Pounds 35m for energy efficiency schemes to help pensioners insulate homes -
almost doubling such support.
Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the
environmental pressure group, said: 'Increasing fuel duty will be
ineffective given that public transport infrastructure is falling apart'.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said the Budget was 'better for the
environment than expected'. He added that the increase in fuel duty
confirmed the UK's decision to go its own way in imposing energy taxes and
to oppose co-ordinated European energy taxes.
The UK committed itself at last year's Rio Earth Summit to bringing
emissions of carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels in the year 2000 - an
estimated cut of 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) on projected levels, or about 6
per cent.
The government now expects the annual real increases in fuel duty of 5 per
cent to account for a quarter of the target, or 2.5mtC - a rise of 1mtC
compared with the spring Budget.
Measures to encourage energy saving in the home, including the imposition of
VAT on fuel, are expected to save 4mtC. Business are expected to save 2.5mtC
through energy conservation, and the public sector a further 1mtC.
Mr Yeo said that the home energy savings total had been 'reduced slightly'
since the last Budget because of fears that past estimates had double
counted potential savings.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Industry welcome for gender age equality -
Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women will have to wait until 65 - the same as men - to receive state
pension benefits by the year 2020, Mr Kenneth Clarke said yesterday.
Equalisation will be phased in over a 10-year period, beginning in 2010, and
no woman aged 44 or over now will be affected by the measure. When the
change is complete, it is expected to save the government Pounds 5bn a year
in social security payments.
The Department of Social Security, which has been considering ways of
equalising men's and women's pension ages for nearly two years, is said to
have strongly favoured the move and argued that given fiscal constraints, no
alternative was possible. However, the government has been loathe to adopt a
policy likely to further alienate older voters.
The pensions industry yesterday generally welcomed the chancellor's
long-awaited announcement, saying that its indecision up until now had
actually made scheme administration more difficult.
'We welcome the fact that the government has finally made a decision,' said
Mr David Morgan, head of parliamentary affairs for the National Association
of Pension Funds, the pension industry trade association.
The Confederation of British Industry, the UK's largest employers' body,
which had earlier criticised government delay on the matter, said: 'We
welcome the long-awaited announcement that the government has decided on
equalising pensions at age 65.'
A landmark ruling from the European Court of Justice in May 1990 required
employers to offer equal pension benefits to men and women. Because
occupational pension benefits are integrated with state benefits through
Guaranteed Minimum Pensions, employers have been unable to equalise private
pension benefits. They fear that failure to equalise benefits completely
could leave them open to substantial claims from former male employees
claiming preferential treatment for women.
The pensions industry now expects Social Security Secretary Mr Peter Lilley
to announce today plans to equalise retirement ages for men and women
receiving GMP and its counterpart, the State Earnings Related Pension
Scheme. Also, it is considered likely that he will announce a review of the
financing of both those programmes.
Because so much money can be saved by raising women's pension ages five
years, the pensions industry had little hope that its preferred option - a
flexible pension age for both men and women over 60 - would be adopted.
Nevertheless, some in the industry expressed disappointment.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: U-turn boost for motorway tolls - Private finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and IAN FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night appeared to have performed a U-turn by accepting
that it would be prepared to pay 'shadow tolls' to investors in privately
financed motorways.
A statement issued by the Treasury said that promoters of private schemes
would 'receive payments from the Government in relation to the level of
traffic using the road.'
Ministers previously have rejected the use of shadow tolls saying they
removed much of the risk from investors.
The Treasury has consistently said that an element of risk should be an
integral part of any private investment in infrastructure.
Officials said yesterday that the Department of Transport would hold 'early
discussions with the construction industry and others to identify
appropriate schemes.'
Longer term it expected to move to a system of electronic motorway charging
when the technology was ready.
The government also approved a string of schemes which it wants the private
sector to finance build and and in some cases operate. These included a
Pounds 600m modernisation of Britain's deteriorating west coast main railway
line.
A new Pounds 200m Scottish air traffic control centre for the Civil Aviation
Authority is proposed to expand capacity for flights to and across Scotland
and the North Atlantic.
A Pounds 100m project will extend the London Docklands Light Railway south
from the Isle of Dogs via a new tunnel under the Thames to Lewisham. Bids
will be invited during next year with a view to opening the new service in
1997-98.
The Chancellor cited the Aintree NHS Trust in Liverpool as a model for what
the government wanted. Here, the private sector will build and operate a
100-bed low-dependency patient hotel, with conference and catering
facilities in the grounds of Fazakerly Hospital.
The NHS Trust will contract for a proportion of the facilities in the
patient hotel. Spare capacity will be sold by the private operator to other
customers.
Other private sector finance initiatives include provision for new prisons
and secure training centres.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Air traffic control may be privatised - Aviation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering privatising air traffic control services to
help finance new civil aviation investment programmes.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday set up a working group of
officials to report by early 1994 on the possibility of transferring the
Civil Aviation Authority's National Air Traffic Service (NATS) operations to
the private sector.
An airline industry lobby has been campaigning for splitting air traffic
control services from the CAA, arguing that privatisation would make NATS
more cost-efficient and reduce airline charges. Opponents have said that
privatising these services, which employ about 5500 people, would raise
serious safety issues and that it was best for an independent government
agency like the CAA to retain control of these operations.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Local government a big loser - Public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The moves to reduce the fiscal deficit shift a larger proportion of
Britain's public spending towards social security, health and education and
away from local government, transport, defence and public housing.
The biggest loser in the announcement of spending plans for the next three
years is spending by central government departments on local government,
which has been cut by Pounds 860m in 1994-95 compared with the plans set out
in the March Budget.
In 1994-95 spending by the chancellor's departments - including the Treasury
and the Central Statistical Office - has been shaved by Pounds 130m to
Pounds 3.43bn. This is part of the general drive to cut spending throughout
the civil service by low growth in wage costs and greater efficiency.
Relative winners have been central government spending on education and
health which have been boosted by Pounds 390m and Pounds 480m respectively
in 1994-95 compared with plans set out in March. The new totals for these
departments are Pounds 10.49bn and Pounds 31.73bn.
Defence spending has been reduced by Pounds 260m in 1994-95,while transport
has been cut by Pounds 210m with the roads programme a particular casualty.
Spending by the Department of the Environment on housing has been cut by
Pounds 250m.
In 1994-95, social security departmental spending has been increased by
Pounds 1.55bn compared with the total agreed in March, mainly due to higher
pensions and payments to poorer people hit by the imposition of VAT on fuel.
The new totals for central government spending on defence, transport and
housing in 1994-95 work out at Pounds 23.49bn, Pounds 5.85bn and Pounds
7.43bn. Social security spending - easily the biggest share of the total -
comes out at Pounds 68.8bn
The new figures are part of the public spending control total which in
1994-95 has been set at Pounds 251.3bn. Allowing for a classification change
linked to altered national accounting treatment of the fossil fuel levy, the
1994-95 figure is Pounds 3.6bn less than that set out in the March Budget.
Another way the Treasury has cut back spending is to have reduced the
unallocated reserve which is part of the 1994-95 control total from the
Pounds 7bn figure in the March Budget to Pounds 3.5bn.
Rather than spread the Pounds 3.5bn removed from reserve among spending
programmes - which has been the Treasury practice in comparable Budgets in
recent years - the department has taken the money out of public spending
altogether.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Bringing PSBR back to balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS, EMMA TUCKER and RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiscal stance:
The government aims to 'bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium
term' and ensure 'the public sector borrows no more than is required to
finance its net capital spending'.
Page 36
Spending squeezed:
Planned general government expenditure next year is Pounds 3.8bn lower than
previously forecast, Pounds 2.1bn lower in 1995-96 and Pounds 4.4bn lower in
1996-97. The control total for next year has been reduced to Pounds 251.3bn,
Pounds 3.6bn below the level announced in March and a fall in real terms of
1 1/4 per cent. For 1995-96 and 1996-97 the control totals will be Pounds
1.5bn and Pounds 2.9bn lower. This should reduce total spending from 45 per
cent of GDP this financial year to 41 per cent in 1998-99.
Taxes up:
The bulk of the fiscal tightening comes from higher taxes. Taxes go up by an
extra Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95, Pounds 4.9bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 6.1bn in
1996-97. Combined with the tax increases announced in March, total taxes
will rise by Pounds 8.5bn next year rising to Pounds 16.4bn in 1996-97.
Taxes as a percentage of GDP go up from 36 1/2 per cent this financial year
to 39 3/4 per cent in 1996-97 and 40 3/4 per cent in 1998-99.
PSBR cut:
Public borrowing, including privatisation proceeds, falls from Pounds 50bn
this year to Pounds 38bn in 1994-95 - 5.5 per cent of GDP - Pounds 6.5bn
lower than forecast last March. The 1996-97 forecast deficit is Pounds 21bn,
2 3/4 per cent of GDP and Pounds 13bn lower than forecast. By 1998-99 the
PSBR should fall to  1/4 per cent of GDP, while taxes exceed current
spending in 1997-98. The chancellor suspended the full-funding rule, saying
he will sell Pounds 7bn fewer gilts next year than would otherwise be needed
to fund the PSBR. Pages 36, 39
Taxes:
Personal taxes:
No change in 20p, 25p or 40p rates of income tax; personal allowance frozen;
basic rate limit frozen at Pounds 23,700. The 20p lower band to be extended
by further Pounds 500, in line with March budget, to Pounds 3,000. No change
to inheritance tax nor exempt amount for capital gains tax. Proposals to
yield Pounds 550m in 1994-95 and Pounds 720m in 1995-96. Pages 28, 46
Married couple's allowance:
Rate of relief to be cut further from 20 per cent in April 1994 to 15 per
cent in April 1995 to yield Pounds 830m in 1995-96 and over Pounds 1bn in a
full year. Page 28
Mortgage interest relief
Rate of relief to be similarly restricted from 20 per cent to 15 per cent in
1995-96, to raise Pounds 950m, adding Pounds 10 a month for those with
mortgages of Pounds 30,000 upwards. Pages 29, 24
Taxes on spending:
No change in VAT. Page 24
New taxes on air travel and insurance
From October 1995 a new departure tax of Pounds 5 per passenger for flights
to anywhere in UK and European Union, and Pounds 10 to other destinations,
to raise Pounds 330m in full year. From same month, a 3 per cent tax on most
general UK insurance premiums to raise Pounds 750m in a full year. Pages 24,
29, 43
Excise duties:
Duty on tobacco products to rise immediately by 7.3 per cent, an increase of
11 pence per pack of 20 cigarettes, and set to rise by 3 per cent a year in
real terms in future Budgets. No increase on beer or other spirits, but wine
up 2p per bottle on January 1 1994. Vehicle Excise Duty for cars and light
vans up Pounds 5 to Pounds 130 from December 1. Petrol and diesel up 3p a
litre, with 5 per cent increases planned for future. Page 24
Business taxation:
No change to 33 per cent main rate or 25 per cent lower rate of corporation
tax, but profits limit for small companies raised by 20 per cent. Prompt
payment measures to be introduced.
Pages 22; 24; 43
National insurance:
Employers' contributions to fall 0.2 per cent to 10.2 per cent. NICs to be
cut by 1 per cent for employees earning less than Pounds 200 a week. Page 43
Deregulation for small businesses:
To include simpler regime for working out personal tax; an immediate rise in
VAT registration threshold for small companies to Pounds 45,00 from Pounds
37,600, enabling 75,000 traders to opt out of VAT altogether; and scrapping
of audit requirement for companies with turnover of less than Pounds 90,000.
Page 22
Capital Gains Tax:
Increase on relief for entrepreneurs when they sell a business on retirement
to first Pounds 250,000 of capital gains and half-exemption on next Pounds
750,000.
Page 29
VAT-on-fuel compensation package:
To give extra help worth Pounds 1 1/4 bn to 15m people, mainly pensioners,
by 1996-97. Pensioners all to be eligible for additional 50p a week (70p for
couples) on top of normal uprating from April 1994. Same rise again in April
1995, so extra help then totals Pounds 1 for all single pensioners. Cold
weather payments up 25 per cent to Pounds 7 a week next winter. All
pensioners to qualify for energy efficiency grants. Pensioners Guaranteed
Income Bond to be introduced. Pages 19, 28, 44
Spending:
Public-sector pay:

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Guarded praise for Clarke's balancing act - City
reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reaction to the Budget in the City was dominated by praise for the
chancellor's skill in raising revenue without imposing damaging new taxes
and relief at his decision to leave the taxation of pension funds unchanged.
But there was scepticism as to whether his proposed cuts in public spending
could be achieved.
Most City commentators thought that the Budget had done nothing to harm
confidence, and opened the way for further interest rate cuts in the first
half of next year. Even the insurance sector gave it a broad welcome,
despite its disappointment at the 3 per cent tax on general premiums.
The new investment incentives - such as the Enterprise Investment Scheme -
were seen as marginal initiatives to boost private investment.
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, a former Treasury adviser to Mr Norman Lamont and
now chief executive of Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, said: 'The
markets are clearly relieved that there has been no change in the taxation
of pension funds, which would have hit funds badly when surpluses are
falling.'
He said reaction to the tax changes was 'generally favourable, except for
those sectors - particularly insurance - most directly affected.' However,
he voiced scepticism about whether the public spending cutbacks could be
achieved, 'particularly in the 'out years' of the three-year horizon
sketched out'.
Mr Andrew Jones, national tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young, gave the Budget a
cautious welcome but said the chancellor was risking everything on economic
recovery. 'He has only avoided massive tax increases by assuming that he can
deliver more rigorous control of public expenditure than ever before. By
pinning all his hopes on reduced spending, he has placed a huge strain on
the government's project management skills.'
Mr David Rough, investments director at Legal &amp; General, said Mr Clarke had
made a 'very competent impression' in the City, and had raised 'serious
prospects' of another half point off base rates within three months. 'There
were no shocks, and he has done nothing to harm confidence.'
However, he was 'disappointed' at the 3 per cent tax on general insurance
premiums and predicted a move to personal self-insurance as a result.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Smith attacks welfare cuts to bolster spending -
Opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the government of mounting 'a
vicious attack on the welfare state' to pay for public spending cuts.
Mr Smith's short but passionate response to the Budget prompted a roar of
support from Labour MPs, who had earlier appeared demoralised by the
chancellor's robust performance. He accused Mr Clarke of betraying
Conservative election promises, and pledged that Labour would try to amend
the finance bill to defend welfare benefits.
The Labour leader warned commentators to be 'very careful' about the
chancellor's forecasts for public spending, which he claimed were achieved
by 'sleight of hand'.
He said the government had hidden the detailed figures. He told Mr Clarke:
'You may live to regret saying that you have public borrowing 'once and for
all' under control.' Mr Smith said the Budget would cost the average family
at least Pounds 5 a week next year, and Pounds 5.40 a week in 1995/96 - on
top of Pounds 8.50 a week imposed in the March Budget by Mr Norman Lamont,
the former chancellor.
He said the chancellor had glossed over changes in income tax allowances and
mortgage tax relief, and he ridiculed backbench Conservative MPs for being
'so out of touch with public opinion that they actually cheered a Budget
which increases taxation'. Mr Smith said taxation of insurance premiums
amounted to 'a new tax on insuring your car and a new tax on insuring your
home, and it is going to be very expensive because of the boom in crime that
has happened under this government'.
He said the VAT compensation scheme announced by Mr Clarke failed to take
account of millions of poor families who would receive no benefits.
Mr Smith also attacked the chancellor's 'odious' reduction of earnings
related unemployment benefit as 'a trick' designed to reduce the
unemployment total.
But he reserved his strongest venom for the changes to invalidity benefits,
which he contrasted with Mr Clarke's 'absolutely disgusting' failure to
tackle tax loopholes Labour claims to have identified.
'This is a party that believes that when the chancellor needs to raise money
he should turn to the sick and the poor,' he said.
Mr Smith said the chancellor had failed to understand that the government
Budget deficit was a symptom of Britain's economic problems, rather than a
cause. He said raising taxes and cutting spending would do nothing to tackle
underlying economic problems, and could worsen them.
'This is a government which ignores mass unemployment, and ignores the
economic weakness which is the legacy of its party in office. This is not
the government which Britain needs,' he said.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Vickers set to win order for 250 tanks - Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is poised to place an order thought to be worth about Pounds
800m for up to 250 Vickers Challenger 2 battle tanks for the army.
The decision is expected to be announced shortly in a bid to offset the
impact of further defence cuts in the budget.
Following an order for 127 Challenger 2s in 1991, the additional purchase
would secure work at Vickers' twin-tank production lines at Leeds and
Newcastle upon Tyne until after the turn of the century. Each plant employs
about 800.
Military planners have argued that Pounds 800m would be enough to buy
sufficient tanks to equip all eight tank regiments in Britain's slimmed-down
army.
Vickers has been anxiously awaiting the order following setbacks to export
hopes for the Challenger 2 in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Its sole
export customer so far is Oman, which has ordered 18 with an option for 18
more. But Vickers wants to compete for an expected 230-tank Saudi order.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, may provide an indication of the UK
government's intention today.
The government may also give Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, a
commitment to buy EH101 helicopters for the RAF.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Conservative rebels find much to welcome -
Backbench reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a clever Budget and a very well-crafted one. That was the
overwhelming verdict of Tory backbenchers.
Even MPs who have rebelled on important issues over the past 18 months -
often to the intense discomfort of the government - were yesterday queueing
up to pay chancellor Kenneth Clarke their compliments.
Of course, there were isolated gripes.
Mr John Butterfill, the MP for Bournemouth West who earlier this year
campaigned hard for a revision to proposed changes in the North Sea tax
regime, said he was concerned at Mr Clarke's decision to underfund the
deficit. This was 'not something I would want to see perpetuated.'
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield who has been a staunch
opponent of imposing VAT on fuel, said the proposed changes in eligibility
for unemployment benefit were 'unfortunate.'
But neither thought backbench concerns were serious enough to trigger a
full-fledged rebellion.
'I cannot see anything I will be rebelling on,' Mr Butterfill said. He added
that it was a good Budget for small business.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, the strongly Euro-sceptic MP for Billericay, said the
Budget - though 'full of good things' - confronted the government with an
acid-test: would it be able to exercise as tight a control over its in-house
expenditure as it has promised?
'If you presented a company budget on the grounds it was going to become
efficient in two or three years, I don't think you would please the
shareholders,' she said.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Gilts rally at PSBR forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK gilts rallied sharply on Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget, cheered by news that
next year's public sector borrowing requirement will be Pounds 38bn, well
below the initial forecast of Pounds 44bn.
'Overall, it's a very, very good Budget for the market,' said Mr Ifty Islam,
gilts analyst at Merrill Lynch, who said that the cuts in public-sector
spending were particularly encouraging.
Gilts jumped by a point during the Budget speech with the long gilt future
going on to hit a record high.
The December contract rallied from 115 25/32 just before the speech through
its previous high of 116 1/4 . In after-hours trading it reached a high of
116 29/32 .
It is expected to continue its rally today.
'The gilt market loves it,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist with
Midland Global Markets. 'Clarke's done what people wanted - and
significantly more.'
The Bank of England yesterday announced another Pounds 3bn of 6.75 per cent
gilts due 2004 to be auctioned next Wednesday.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Closing loopholes may save up to Pounds 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Payments in gold bars, coffee beans and manipulations of profit-related pay
formulae are among the choice options of tax avoiders that were killed in
the Budget. The chancellor closed a number of loopholes which he estimated
would save Pounds 2bn over the next three years.
The most significant proposals were:
Prevention of any artificial schemes to avoid pay-as-you-earn and National
Insurance contributions by paying staff in gold, coffee and other assets.
The estimated savings will be Pounds 200m in 1994-95 and a further Pounds
75m in 1995-96.
The change will stop such payments for pay-as-you-earn from the time of the
Finance Act next year. But the same schemes in use for National Insurance
contributions were cancelled from midnight.
Tightened regulations on profit-related pay to ensure that relief is
concentrated on genuine schemes for employees. The estimated savings will be
Pounds 40m in 1993-94 and Pounds 100m in 1994-95.
The amendments will increase the upper limit on profits which an employer
may disregard in calculating profit-related pay and remove disproportionate
status to special schemes favouring particular units within a business.
Only permitting indexation of capital gains in the future to extinguish a
capital gain, and not to create or increase a capital loss. This is expected
to raise Pounds 50m in 1994-95, rising to about Pounds 300m in 1996-97.
Preventing companies from being sold in circumstances to ensure that their
liabilities cannot be collected, which could save Pounds 100m.
Toughening up the conditions for companies that control foreign companies in
low tax areas overseas, estimated to save Pounds 50m.
Tightening abuses on stamp duty, which should save Pounds 60m in 1994-95.
The chancellor also ended a little known tax relief on payments made as a
result of extortion paid to criminals.
Mr Clarke said:
'The tax avoidance industry is always ingenious, but it is one industry
which this government has never helped.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Clarke targets tax perks - Mortgage interest
relief and student grants in the forefront of chancellor's attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke targeted middle-class perks in his efforts to find more
tax revenues, claiming that people could afford to do without them.
And while most other allowances and tax rates were not changed the combined
effects of Mr Clarke's measures and those already put in train by his
predecessor Mr Norman Lamont mean that people with a personal allowance and
a married couple's allowance will pay Pounds 61 more tax next year on
earnings between Pounds 8,000 and Pounds 30,000 a year, and Pounds 319 above
that. The decision to override indexation means that the same people will be
Pounds 94 and Pounds 443 poorer respectively than if Mr Clarke had allowed
tax bands and allowances to rise.
Foremost of the attacks on perks was the much-predicted cut in relief on
mortgage interest, which will go down to 15 per cent in 1995-96. Earlier
this year Mr Lamont had already set in motion a cut from 25 per cent to 20
per cent next April. The ceiling on loans qualifying for relief remains at
Pounds 30,000.
Together, the two cuts will recoup nearly Pounds 1bn from homebuyers by
1995-96. This rapid stepping down from the 40 per cent level at which relief
stood three years ago suggests that the government already has its sights on
abolition.
The cut means that a borrower with a mortgage of Pounds 30,000 or more will
pay Pounds 10 a month extra tax from 1995-96, assuming interest rates remain
unchanged. He will also have to pay Pounds 20 more a month for his mortgage.
But Mr Clarke pointed out that the sharp fall in interest rates has already
cut the cost of a mortgage - by Pounds 160 a month in the case of a Pounds
33,000 loan.
Another target was the student grant. 'Tuition is free,' Mr Clarke said,
'but why should the bus driver or the pensioner also pay higher taxes to
finance the living costs of tomorrow's lawyers?'
So the shift from grants to loans for student maintenance, initiated in the
mid-80s, is to be accelerated. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said
last night that grants would be cut by 10 per cent in 1994-95 with a
parallel increase in loans. Similar adjustments would be made over the next
two years until, in 1996-97, loans and grants would be in broad balance.
On income tax the chancellor left most of the key rates and allowances
unchanged. But while this means no rise in income tax, the freezing of the
tax bands and allowances rather than indexing them to inflation amounts to a
hidden tax. With wages rising by about 3 per cent a year this will yield
Pounds 550m next year and Pounds 1.55bn the year after. The chancellor is
obliged by law to index allowances and tax rates, so yesterday's
announcement will require parliament's approval.
The three tax bands remain as before: 20 per cent, 25 per cent and 40 per
cent. In his last Budget Mr Lamont had already foreshadowed a Pounds 500
increase in the 20 per cent band to raise it to Pounds 3,000 in 1994-95.
Most of the allowances also stay the same rather than rising with inflation.
The personal allowance, for example, stays at Pounds 3,445; if it had been
indexed it would have gone up to Pounds 3,515.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Public-sector pay freeze extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs were slowly waking up last night to a hidden bombshell in the Budget -
the extension of next year's public-sector freeze in the pay bill for an
extra two years to 1997.
The announcement, which will affect up to 5m public-sector workers,
triggered an angry response from union leaders, who forecast substantial job
cuts.
But it prompted no reaction from opposition MPs, who appeared not to have
grasped the full implications of the chancellor's announcement.
It was also misunderstood by some Conservative MPs, who thought the pay-bill
freeze applied only to about 400,000 civil servants.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, failed to mention the freeze in his
response to the Budget, in spite of his anger at the chancellor's other tax
and spending measures.
The announcement, extending a pay-bill freeze announced earlier this year,
is the first attempt by any government to freeze public-sector pay for three
consecutive years.
It was glossed over in the chancellor's speech and hidden in the details of
the Budget red book, where the wording appeared to be ambiguous.
Mr Clarke told MPs: 'Central government running costs, including pay bills,
will be frozen at this year's cash level. Pay increases for public-sector
staff will therefore have to be paid for by greater efficiency or savings in
the cost of running government.'
The red book, which gives fuller details of the chancellor's decisions, says
that central government running costs will be frozen until 1996-97 at the
1993-94 level of Pounds 20.1bn.
It adds: 'Provision for pay throughout the rest of the public sector has
been set on a comparable basis. The general government pay bill is not
therefore expected to change much next year, except where major workload
changes are projected.'
The Treasury confirmed that the wording means all public-sector pay bills
will be frozen until 1997. However, officials said this did not mean that
pay would necessarily be frozen.
Few MPs on either side of the House appeared to grasp the chancellor's
meaning while he was speaking, and most were still in the dark several hours
later.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: True believer gains credit -  Michael Portillo,
Tory hero behind the scenes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke got the plaudits on the day. But on the Conservative back
benches at Westminster Mr Michael Portillo will take much of the political
credit for the Budget.
In theory, as chief secretary to the Treasury and the chancellor's number
two, Mr Portillo is the most junior member of the cabinet.
He is just 40 years old. He is one of the three rightwing cabinet 'bastards'
castigated by Mr John Major in one of the prime minister's more intemperate
moments during the crisis over the Maastricht treaty.
But he is also the heir to Lady Thatcher's mantle. A true believer and
self-confessed conviction politician, he is seen by the Tory right as the
natural candidate for the party leadership.
So Mr Clarke's decision to balance another round of tax increases with
unexpectedly large reductions in public spending will do nothing to dim Mr
Portillo's rising star.
A politician committed to reducing progressively the share of the nation's
income taken by the state, he got as much as any on the Tory right could
have hoped for in terms of cuts in spending targets for the next three
years.
The chief secretary cannot claim it was all his own work. Under the new
system for sharing out the Whitehall spending cake the final decisions on
each departmental budget are taken by a cabinet committee, the so-called
EDX.
Nor were the additional cuts announced yesterday the result of a pre-planned
operation to sweeten the pill for the Tory right of another round of tax
increases. When EDX first started serious negotiations in September it aimed
to meet the Treasury's original, higher, spending targets.
It was only when savings started to come along faster than expected that the
decision was made to take a political trick by lowering those targets.
There was also sleight of hand. A close look at the figures suggests that a
significant chunk of the savings will come from a fortuitous drop in the
government's contributions to Brussels. The projected public-sector pay
freeze on which all the figures are predicated remains a heroic assumption.
But Mr Portillo was the chief prosecutor, attacking every bid for extra cash
from the ministers who run the big Whitehall spending empires.
He was the driving force in the often acrimonious negotiations between the
Treasury and Whitehall departments which led to what promises to be the
toughest squeeze since the government took office in 1979.
He has also been shaping the parallel long-term spending reviews which are
challenging many of the basic assumptions which have underpinned the welfare
state since the last war. Mr Clarke may insist that his commitment to
preserve the welfare system is unshakeable. But the chancellor has done
nothing to prevent Mr Portillo appearing almost weekly on the nation's
television screens questioning the long-term future of some of its principal
building blocks. Even the state pension can no longer be regarded as
inviolate.
Some times in the latest round of negotiations the chief secretary went too
far. He wanted the government to break the pledge in its general election
manifesto to maintain the real value of child benefit. Perhaps he forgot for
a moment that Mr John Major had personally insisted on that commitment.
But such setbacks have hardly dented Mr Portillo's most significant
political success over the past few months. He demanded and got large-scale
reductions in the budgets for defence, local authorities, housing and
transport.
More importantly, he managed to open up both within and outside the
government a debate which has posed fundamental questions about the
respective roles and responsibilities of the state and the individual.
Politics will probably dictate that Mr Major's government retreats from some
of the harsher conclusions of its welfare-state review.
Mr Portillo has the Tory right on his side but the mood will shift once the
economy strengthens and the general election approaches. The proposed cuts
in invalidity and unemployment benefit already threaten a dangerous
political battle.
But Mr Portillo is there for the long haul. Mr Clarke has confirmed his
place as heir apparent in the event that Mr Major were to fall by the
political wayside. But henceforth the chancellor will be looking over his
shoulder.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Major defends contacts with Sinn Fein

Mr John Major underlined the government's determination to keep lines of
communication with Sinn Fein open as he made a vigorous Commons defence
yesterday of this year's extensive contacts with Provisional leaders.
Speaking less than 24 hours after the release of papers suggesting that the
IRA had been on the verge of ending its campaign of violence, the prime
minister told MPs it would be useful to continue to have a confidential
channel of communication.
But the air of optimism stemming from the supportive response of most MPs to
this week's revelations was tempered by continuing doubt over the date of
this month's Dublin summit and by renewed violence in Belfast.
A Roman Catholic man was shot dead by members of the outlawed paramilitary
Ulster Volunteer Force as he prepared to drive home from the factory where
he worked in loyalist east Belfast.
The shooting added weight to a warning by Lord Tebbit, the former
Conservative party chairman, that attempts to reach an understanding with
the IRA risked provoking an escalation of violence from loyalist
paramilitaries.
The summit between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart,
could still take place this Friday. Downing Street said the two sides were
continuing to 'prepare the ground'.
The two leaders had spoken by telephone on Monday evening, it said.
Continuing differences over the drafting of a joint communique were
underlined last night by Dublin, which said there was 'no question' of it
participating in a 'fudge'. Intense contacts between the offices of the two
leaders continued last night but Downing Street was unwilling to say whether
the summit would go ahead on December 3.

FT  01 DEC 93 / US predicts outline trade deal: Kantor hopes for preliminary
agreement with EU by weekend

<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, predicted yesterday that the
US and the European Union would this week produce an outline of preliminary
agreements for the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, including deals on
agriculture and tariff cuts.
But Mr Kantor, speaking before leaving for Brussels, said there was 'grave
doubt' that he and his EU counterpart, Sir Leon Brittan, could produce a
complete draft text this week.
Mr Kantor's determination to conclude an outline deal within 48 hours was
shared in Brussels amid fresh signs that France was prepared to soften its
hardline stance.
France has shelved earlier threats to veto a trade-liberalising deal within
the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It signalled
its readiness to sign an agreement if 'French national interests are
protected'.
The French move follows warnings from Germany and the UK that failure to
reach a Gatt deal would jeopardise prospects for an economic recovery in
Europe and risk splitting the EU. Underlining German concern, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and French prime minister Edouard Balladur agreed, on the
opening day of summit talks in Bonn yesterday, to work hand-in-hand for a
Gatt deal.
Mr Kantor, voicing optimism, said there was 'great flexibility' in talks on
market access for farm products. He also hinted that preliminary agreement
had been reached on rules for a new multinational trading organisation and
said there was 'great room for manoeuvrability' on the dispute over trade in
audiovisual products.
Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, hinted that the Clinton
administration was prepared to modify its adamant refusal to renegotiate its
position on the Blair House accord on farm trade.
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said, after addressing
a French parliament committee, that 'the Americans seem to be beginning to
budge' towards meeting European demands on reducing tariffs and liberalising
services.
Meanwhile, French farm union leaders vowed to step up their efforts to
prevent any retreat by France in its opposition to the Blair House
agreement.

FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Clarke clearly has a bee in his bonnet about small businesses. There was
a welter of measures to help them including, after years of lobbying, the
possibility of interest charges on the late payment of bills. Equity capital
may also be raised through a replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme
and, in time, via venture capital investment trusts.
It will be interesting to see whether the Enterprise Investment Scheme is
any more successful than BES at attracting genuine risk capital. Even before
industrial companies were crowded out of the BES market by assured
tenancies, the thrust of the BES was to construct low risk ways to exploit
the tax advantage. The new EIS attempts to avoid that by lowering the entry
tax relief but reducing the cost of failure by granting tax losses. Yet
there are inherent difficulties with direct investment in this area, not
least the high failure rate which requires a well-analysed portfolio and the
provision of exit routes from those investments which do survive.
Even the new scheme is thus not suitable for most private investors, and may
not raise the desired cash for small businesses. Perhaps the best use for
the EIS will be in encouraging successful entrepreneurs to reinvest their
profits in a new venture and add their experience to the board. That gives
plenty of room for abuse, but the lack of management skills in small
companies is every bit as important as the dearth of equity finance.

FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Infrastructure projects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As has become the custom for Tory chancellors at budget time, Mr Kenneth
Clarke mouthed worthy words about private sector investment in public
infrastructure projects. A vision of gleaming new privately-financed
hospitals and motorways funded by electronic charges briefly shimmered on
the horizon. This will only cause pained laughter among those companies
which have fruitlessly bashed their heads against the Treasury's conceptual
walls. But Mr Clarke promises to be more pragmatic than his predecessors.
His admission of the need for a complete change of culture within government
is refreshingly candid. The private finance working group headed by Sir
Alastair Morton is a more tangible sign of intent. The approval of three
transport projects is a further encouraging, if modest, development.
Yet the best reason to believe Mr Clarke is that he has no choice.
Large-scale infrastructure spending is a political necessity which the state
can no longer afford. This may hold out tempting opportunities for the
construction sector longer term. But its immediate worry is there will be a
hiatus in activity while the practical difficulties are resolved. Both
social housing spending and the roads programme have been cut - though by
less than the stock market feared. It will take years for private sector
infrastructure spending to take up the capacity slack and become a
meaningful source of profits.

FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Foreign Income Dividend scheme promised in the last budget has not
solved the problem of unrelieved advance corporation tax. As expected, the
new class of dividend will not carry the 20 per cent tax credit normally
reclaimed by pension funds on conventional dividends. Since the Treasury
will not allow different classes of dividend to be targeted at different
types of shareholder, companies which pay FIDs will risk the opprobrium of
this powerful group. Forcing companies to pay higher dividends to compensate
pension funds for the lost tax credit can hardly be what the chancellor had
in mind. Companies with intractable ACT problems will doubtless still look
hard at paying FIDs. Concessions made on the initial proposals at least make
the scheme look workable. Allowing companies to pay FIDs out of prior year
profits, for example, will help ensure that potentially volatile overseas
profits are available in all years to cover the payment. But alternative
methods for reducing ACT such as enhanced scrip dividends - which the
chancellor has done nothing to discourage - are likely to remain the
preferred option.
Many institutional investors will object on principle to another round of
enhanced scrips, on the grounds that companies are establishing rolling
rights issues in place of cash dividends. Forced to choose between their
principles and an effective cut in dividend, though, pension funds will find
themselves torn.

FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Clarke's promised land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The equity market's initially warm response to the Budget speech is partly a
mark of sheer relief. There was no hit to pensions, no extension of VAT and
no clampdown on enhanced scrip dividends. But while taxes have been
increased by only Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95, it requires an act of faith to
believe the government can deliver the spending cuts which constitute the
rest of the deal. For next year these consist largely in lopping Pounds
3.5bn off the contingency reserve, which is all right only as long as the
money does not creep back on to departmental spending totals.
Ultimately, control of spending matters much more to the gilt and equity
markets than the immediate promise of Pounds 7bn of under-funding and
commitment to balance the budget by the end of the decade. On under-funding,
the chancellor did in any case little more than to firm up Mr Lamont's
earlier line, while promises for the millennium may eventually be as
conveniently forgotten as his predecessor's commitment to balance the budget
over the cycle. Mr Clarke, though, seemed apprised of the political
advantages of being seen to tackle the PSBR 'once and for all'. A sense that
grip is being restored may boost the government's standing, helping both
equities and gilts. In theory, the equity market should not be so sanguine
about growth if the PSBR really is to be squeezed. There is not much joy for
consumers. Mortgage interest relief is definitely on the way out. Those who
console themselves with a trip to the sun will find it costs more to drive
to the airport and an extra tenner to take off. Yet Mr Clarke's optimism on
inflation points to further interest rate cuts, while the determination to
boost small companies which pervaded the budget is also encouraging. That
could boost both employment and demand.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Penalties for excess baggage: The Airbus consortium must
restructure and rationalise if it is to compete with US airline
manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European dreams of taking on the world in commercial aerospace can fly, as
Airbus has shown over the past 23 years. Yesterday, the European consortium
celebrated one of its biggest coups against Boeing when it delivered the
first of 50 Airbus A320 aircraft to United Airlines, one of its US rival's
most prized customers.
But for all the pomp and ceremony at the handover, anxiety is growing among
Airbus partners that their success in building high-technology airliners may
have engendered a corporate dinosaur.
Mr Jean Pierson, the outspoken Airbus chief executive, sounded warning bells
last month with one of the provocative throwaway phrases he likes to toss
off between puffs at a Gitane cigarette. The Airbus system had now reached
its 'genetic limits', he said, and without change it was in danger of losing
out to its American competition.
'Success is not eternal; unless we work on it we won't be able to meet the
new challenges facing our industry,' added a close adviser.
Attempts to rationalise the consortium have failed to bring about
significant change, largely because of political squabbling and industrial
rivalries between the partners and their governments. But faced with the
deepest postwar recession in the industry and growing competition from
Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, time is running out for
Airbus.
Like Boeing, Airbus has been hit by the prolonged slump in civil aviation
and the financial difficulties of many customers. It has been forced to cut
its production rate from 157 aircraft last year to 142 this year. Airbus now
expects output to drop to 138 aircraft both next year and in 1995.
The consortium does not expect any significant recovery in new aircraft
orders until 1995 or 1996. Although it still has a backlog of 701 aircraft,
so far this year it has won only 30 new orders and suffered 59
cancellations. By comparison, Boeing has won 225 new orders this year and
faced 214 aircraft cancellations.
All four Airbus shareholders - Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent),
Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent), British Aerospace (20 per cent) and Casa
of Spain (4.2 per cent) - acknowledge that their business partnership set up
two decades ago under the structure of a French Groupement d'Interet
Economique (GIE) has now served its purpose.
Simply put, the commercial success of Airbus, whose sales reached Dollars
8bn last year, is in danger of being undermined by the group's own corporate
structure and complex work-sharing production system based in four
countries.
'Airbus has worked well for a long time,' said the head of one of the four
partner companies. 'We must not forget that Airbus has now taken 30 per cent
of the world market, makes technologically advanced aircraft and has kept
the pressure on Boeing.'
For Airbus, he added, the risk was that, without change, success could
quickly turn into decline, as had happened to McDonnell Douglas. 'McDonnell
Douglas was the clear number two after Boeing, but it did not invest
sufficiently in building up a competitive product range and improving its
production system. With only 10 per cent of the market, it has now been
overtaken by Airbus,' he explained.
All the partners recognise the challenge for Airbus is to transform what was
initially a job and wealth creation consortium to compete against the
dominance of the US manufacturers into an independent company, mature enough
to rationalise and restructure, take hard political and social decisions,
and stand on its own two corporate feet.
Under the French collaborative GIE system, the role of Airbus is to
co-ordinate the production and design of aircraft and market the product
range. It has no obligation to publish annual accounts; and a lack of
financial transparency in a system where the shareholders are the main
suppliers has made it almost impossible to calculate Airbus costs.
The partners and their respective governments diagnosed the trouble four
years ago, when they set up a committee to recommend improvements in the
Airbus system to make it more responsive to market forces. It led to a
streamlining of the management and the appointment of a financial
comptroller. But it stopped short of proposing the evolution of Airbus from
a GIE into a public limited company.
Since that report, Airbus officials concede little significant progress has
been made to overhaul the consortium. 'There has been a lot of thought but
little action to date,' one admitted.
Some improvement has been achieved by focusing all final assembly and
internal aircraft fitting to individual customer specifications for new
Airbus programmes on one site rather than in two different countries. In the
past, Airbus aircraft were assembled in Toulouse, flown to Hamburg for cabin
fitting and flown back to Toulouse for delivery to customers. Now all A330
and A340 widebody aircraft are assembled and fitted in Toulouse, while the
A321 narrowbody aircraft is completed in Hamburg.
A degree of competitive tendering on new aircraft programmes has also been
introduced, but it has been restricted to competition between the four
partners. For the first time, the consortium has also been able to tap
financial markets to secure financing to develop the A321 and A319, new
derivatives of the 150-seat A320.
These limited adjustments have hardly begun to address the scale of
productivity improvements Airbus must make to keep up with Boeing, the
partners agree. In the beginning, Boeing was complacent about the
competitive threat posed by Airbus. But when the European consortium started
making significant inroads in the US market with big orders from old Boeing
customers such as Northwest and United, Boeing reacted on several fronts.
It pressed the Washington administration to campaign against European
government subsidies for Airbus, which led to last year's compromise trade
agreement between Europe and the US on direct and indirect subsidies for new
civil aircraft programmes. It launched a new 400-seat widebody twin-engine
aircraft, the 777, to defend its dominant position at the top end of the
market.
Most significantly, it launched an aggressive long-term cost reduction and
productivity programme with a strong customer focus to remain number one in
the business.
Boeing's target is to reduce costs by 25-30 per cent and halve its aircraft
production cycle times by 1998. It already produces aircraft faster than
Airbus. It takes Boeing about 12 months to complete a 737, while Airbus
takes 15 months to build an A320, which competes directly against the 737.
'Today we can live with this three-month gap, but we will be at a
competitive disadvantage if Boeing achieves its aim to produce a 737 in only
six months by 1998,' said a senior Airbus official. Reducing cycle times
improves productivity and bears directly on costs. 'The benefits of the
modern technology we offer on our aircraft would be eaten up by the cost
attraction of a cheaper aircraft,' he added.
The partners believe Boeing will now fix industry targets and Airbus will
have to keep up. 'This will lead us eventually to change the structure, but
simply turning Airbus into a limited company is no substitute for getting
your processes right,' said Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's financial director.
Standing on the Airbus stand at the recent Dubai air show, Mr Pierson
rattled off a list of inefficiencies in the system: too much bureaucracy and
too long decision times; too much duplication in research and development
and in many production tasks; political pressures reflecting different
national priorities of some partners and their governments; difficulties in
rationalising the overall process because of differing labour and social
regulations in the partner countries; the lack of financial flexibility to
raise funds in the market and support aircraft sales because decisions have
to be adopted unanimously by all four partners.
The convoluted system of how independent component manufacturers supply
parts to Airbus is a classic example of inefficiency, says Mr Pierson. The
UK Lucas Aerospace group supplies about 15 different components for Airbus
aircraft. But none go directly to Airbus.
Instead, some parts are manufactured at Lucas plants in the UK, sent to the
German partner for partial fitting, then back to the UK to BAe at Chester
for assembly on the wing sets BAe builds for Airbus, before the completed
wings are shipped out to Toulouse for final aircraft assembly. Other Lucas
parts are made at the company's French subsidiary but also have to go via
Germany before finding their way back to France.
'We would clearly prefer to supply direct to Airbus,' says Mr Frank Turner,
Lucas Aerospace's managing director. 'You get a much better price, delivery
and service the closer a component manufacturer is to his ultimate
customer,' he explains. In the US, by contrast, Boeing now sends a truck
once a week to Lucas's Jamestown, North Dakota, facility to pick up aircraft
cargo hold components and systems for just-in-time assembly in Seattle.
While paying lip service to the need to rationalise Airbus's production
process and give the consortium an integrated company structure to control
costs and become more responsive to market forces, the partners, for
different reasons, are reluctant to take the plunge.
'The questions the partners should now be asking is whether it makes sense
to have 10 manufacturing plants scattered around Europe and whether they are
European enough to accept that production should be concentrated on the most
cost efficient sites and perhaps, for some tasks, outside Europe,' said a
senior executive of one of the partner companies.
BAe has long campaigned for an Airbus public limited company but, as a
French official pointed out, the UK partner has been as reluctant as the
others to dig deep into his pocket to address the capital funding problems
of setting up an independent company. Aerospatiale has come round to the
idea of establishing an independent structure for Airbus, but it is also
under pressure from its government not to rock the boat with any
restructuring which could provoke the sort of social backlash caused by the
recent Air France job cut proposals.
However, it is Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) which appears to be the biggest
obstacle to any change. German ambitions to become a leader in the European
aerospace industry have caused considerable ill feeling in the consortium.
Other partners were angered by DASA's efforts to co-operate with Boeing on a
very large aircraft project and its takeover this year of the Dutch Fokker
regional jet manufacturer to strengthen its claim to lead all Airbus
narrowbody programmes.
DASA has also been forced to launch a sweeping rationalisation programme
under pressure from its parent, Daimler Benz, itself in the throes of deep
restructuring. 'At present the Germans are simply refusing any change to the
Airbus structure,' said a senior executive in one of the other partner
companies. 'And when we eventually all finally agree to change, it is
important that no single partner should try to seize this situation to
reinforce his position,' he warned.
Although the timetable for turning Airbus into a public limited company is
more uncertain than ever, the partners believe they can make a start by
improving the efficiency of the existing system. For example, they are
considering establishing an asset management organisation within Airbus to
help finance and place used aircraft in the market.
The restructuring and consolidation of other parts of the European
commercial aircraft industry could also provide an incentive for broader
rationalisation at Airbus. Aerospatiale and BAe have been holding intense
talks to try to merge their loss-making turbopropeller businesses into a
joint company. If negotiations succeed, it could help Aerospatiale transfer
its turboprop activities from Toulouse to concentrate all operations there
on Airbus assembly.
Ultimately, the test will be whether the partners are prepared to let Airbus
fly loose with its own independent identity. In many respects, Airbus's
reputation has outstripped that of its partners, although they still regard
Airbus as one of their subsidiaries. 'Unless you can actively form a company
and genuinely run it for the sake of its businesses and not for the sake of
its shareholders, you'll always be second class to a company managed
uniformly like Boeing,' said another Airbus insider.
But prospects for such radical reform, at this stage, appear slim. The
collapse last week of the ambitious Alcazar project by four European
airlines (SAS, KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines) to merge their
operations is a stark reminder of how easy it is for the foundations of
European collaboration to crumble like a Tower of Babel.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Leading Article: The fight for Spanish jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's economy lies becalmed, but Mr Felipe Gonzalez is steering into a
storm. The Spanish prime minister is heading towards confrontation with the
country's trade unions over his plans to force through badly-needed changes
in labour legislation. More strikingly than any other member of the European
Union, Spain offers a case study of how outdated and restrictive employment
laws prevent economies from attaining full potential. Following yesterday's
expiry of a deadline for negotiating labour market reforms, the government
is preparing to impose them through parliamentary action. The unions, which
last week staged protest marches in 50 cities against government policies,
are threatening a general strike in January. As Mr Gonzalez ponders his next
move, the eyes of Europe are on him.
After unexpectedly winning a fourth prime ministerial term in June's
elections, Mr Gonzalez has presided over a gentle reduction in interest
rates. He has announced a relatively tough 1994 budget to try to reduce the
fast-expanding fiscal deficit. The prime minister has hesitated, however, to
put into effect fundamental measures to correct structural flaws in the
economy and pull Spain out of recession. Three months of talks with unions
and employers, designed to agree a 'social pact' on wages, pensions and
labour market measures, have now ended fruitlessly. The time for
equivocation is past. Mr Gonzalez must hesitate no longer.
Unions opposed
The trade unions are trenchantly opposing proposals to dismantle employment
laws placed on the statute book shortly after Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party
took power in 1982. These regulations, some of which bear the hallmarks of
the state corporatism of General Franco, have long outlived any usefulness
they might once have had.
Spain has successfully consolidated its transition to democracy. But it is
now - by overall European standards - a relatively high cost economy. No-one
understands this better than Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy minister, who said
yesterday that unions had lost touch with reality. Spain is competing for
investment not only with other more efficient regions in western Europe, but
also with low-wage countries in eastern and central Europe and east Asia.
Restrictive hire-and-fire procedures, rigidly centralised wage bargaining,
legal impediments on part-time work and apprenticeships, and the state
monopoly on placement services for the unemployed are holding back job
creation and growth. In view of the large black market for labour, Spain's
official unemployment rate - at 22.9 per cent the highest in the EU -
overstates the true scale of the problem. Nonetheless, the statistic
illustrates its hugely wasteful imbalance between labour supply and demand.
Hiring procedures
The cabinet on Friday is due to discuss implementing a decree to make hiring
procedures more flexible. Since the unions regard this and other planned
measures as an assault on workers' rights, a showdown seems inevitable.
However, Mr Gonzalez has the resources to weather the challenge. With the
ending of the 1985-91 economic boom, the unions have lost the power to
impose their will. In contrast to their victory five years ago in forcing Mr
Gonzalez to withdraw a planned youth employment scheme, the half-day general
strike the unions called last May was a half-hearted affair. In parliament,
the Socialists relinquished their absolute majority in June. But the prime
minister can rely on support from the minority Catalan party, the CiU, to
push the employment legislation through the Cortes.
After three peseta devaluations since September 1992, the financial markets
since the June election have given Mr Gonzalez a somewhat grudging benefit
of the doubt. As the peseta's weakness during the past few days indicates,
even this limited confidence will be lost if he again fails to live up to
promises to overhaul economic policy. At stake in the approaching tussle is
far more than Mr Gonzalez's personal authority as Europe's longest-serving
Socialist leader. If Mr Gonzalez fails to meet the challenge he now faces,
Spain can abandon any hope of playing a fully competitive role in the
economy of the new Europe.

Chinese celebrations will never go with a bang again - at least, not in
Beijing. From midnight, Beijing's 10m residents can no longer ignite their
own fire crackers; from now on firecrackers will only be permitted on
official business.
Not surprisingly, Beijingers are grumbling about the ban, which has been
imposed for anti-pollution and personal safety reasons; hundreds are injured
by fireworks each year.
China invented gunpowder in the seventh century and is the spiritual home of
firecrackers, which the Chinese believe frighten off evil spirits. 'Banning
fireworks is like telling Spaniards they can't have bull-fights, or
Brazilians they are not allowed their carnival,' grouses one Beijing
intellectual.

Now that Lord Justice Scott's arms-to-Iraq inquiry has recommenced, senior
civil servants are once more subject to the Rottweiler questioning of
Presiley Baxendale QC and the pointed interjections of M'lord himself.
But the game appears to have moved on.
Some recalcitrant Whitehall mandarins are now so convinced that the enquiry
will get right to the bottom of how the government sold arms to Iraq without
parliament's knowledge that no box or office safe is to being left unopened
in a renewed search for evidence, incriminating or otherwise.
Some crucial documentation, all meticulously flagged, dated and signed, has
suddenly started to appear, along with other papers which were supposed to
have been handed over long ago. Profuse apologies to all concerned.

The surprise retirement of Midland Bank chief executive Brian Pearse once
again raises the longer-term question of who will take over from Sir William
Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, Midland's parent.
Sir William, who will be 62 this month, is well past his bank's normal
retirement age and is also, incidentally, almost two years older than
Pearse. Sir William is expected to soldier on for another two to three years
and, on past form, John Bond, HSBC's group chief executive, would seem his
logical successor.
However, HSBC is a very different animal from what it was when Sir William
inherited the helm from the maverick Sir Michael Sandberg in 1986. For a
start, its stock market capitalisation is twice as big as that of Barclays
and NatWest combined and yet it still seems to be run rather autocratically.
There is a majority of non-executive directors on the HSBC board but it can
hardly be described as a strong one.
The loss of an independent spirit like Brian Pearse means that there will be
one fewer HSBC director who is prepared to stand up and challenge Sir
William's vision of the natural management succession at what is Britain's
fourth biggest company.

An opera buff in the Bank of England's supervision department, which

Isaacs' response was that although the Opera House strives for perfection,
occasionally it falls short - which, he said, was not unlike the recent
experience of the Bank's supervision department.

Why else should his department have released its budget news to the press

However, it also meant that journalists had even more time to reflect on the
full ramifications of a near halving in the government's contribution

Thirty years ago a grumpy General de Gaulle, miffed about his Common Market
partners' behaviour, temporarily withdrew his ambassador from Brussels.
Now one of his supposed kinfolk, Pierre de Boissieu, is to fill the French
chair there, as ambassador to the new European Union. We must say 'supposed'
because de Boissieu's precise relationship to the late general is unclear.
Who's Who in France shows that de Gaulle's daughter married a de Boissieu,
but does not make plain that it was one of Pierre's clan.
Little matter; everyone in the French foreign ministry regards this
48-year-old star diplomat as the embodiment of Gallic, not to say Gaullist,
hauteur.
As director of economic affairs at the Quai d'Orsay, he negotiated the
Maastricht Treaty for France. Those who were on the receiving end of his
whiplash wit may groan at his return to Brussels.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Radicalism on the wane
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the tide of radical policymaking in the English-speaking world on the
turn? The departure of New Zealand's finance minister Ruth Richardson at the
weekend in a post-election cabinet reshuffle could well be an early warning
signal of a wider trend. Ms Richardson was a key member of the so-called
razor gang, a group of ministers committed to reducing the welfare state.
After an election earlier this month in which the parliamentary majority of
the National party was cut from 34 to one, some weakening of radical resolve
was on the cards.
New Zealand has admittedly been the most extreme of the developed countries
that participated in the renaissance of liberal economic policy since the
early 1980s. As well as a package of wholesale privatisation, labour market
liberalisation and financial market deregulation, the country pushed through
the most comprehensive tax reform of recent years. The head of the central
bank's tenure depends on inflation performance: civil servants too are on
fixed-term performance contracts.
Under both Labour and National party governments, New Zealand has been the
most exciting political and economic laboratory of the OECD area. In less
than 10 years the most regulated, distorted and protected economy in the
24-nation club has become the least regulated, least distorted and least
protected. Yet there have been losers, notably among recipients of social
security, where unemployment benefit and pensions have been cut, and
universal family support abolished. The snag is that radicalism has taken
time to work: growth has been sluggish and unemployment has risen.
Slow-burn
Ms Richardson's departure no doubt reflects the slow-burn nature of the
radical cure. Comparable backlashes are weakening governments elsewhere. Yet
the need for continuing radical action remains overwhelming.
One reason is the growth of structural budget deficits and the narrowing of
national tax bases, as increased capital mobility forces governments into
open fiscal competition. Public spending cuts and higher taxes will thus
remain on the agenda for a long time. Electorates' demand for more
transparent tax systems will become more clamorous. If present high levels
of unemployment in the OECD are to fall, the assault on labour market
rigidities must go on. Inefficiencies in public services need to be
addressed and the process of trade liberalisation must not be allowed to
stall.
Perpetual revolution
Yet the strains inherent in this perpetual revolution in micro-economic
management, with huge shifts in the geographical location of jobs and
industries across national boundaries, make the need for social security all
the more pressing. People are being subjected to greater upheavals, and to
greater uncertainty about jobs and retirement prospects, than at any time
since 1945.
The hostility in the US to the North American Free Trade Agreement was
symptomatic of this sense of insecurity. Election results in the US, UK,
Canada and Australia, as well as New Zealand, have confirmed that the public
will not vote for those who promise higher taxes and reduced public
spending. Yet the appetite for services such as health, education and
pensions remains insatiable.
Radicalism offers an obvious resolution of this dilemma. But when the
constituency for radicalism is weakened in recession and public sector debt
is increasing, damage limitation is the order of the day. The question is
whether this second-best alternative results in a loss of political impetus
that causes the radical bandwagon not merely to slow down, but to go into
reverse.
The Gatt deadline on December 15 provides an early test. In the longer run
the question is whether the combination of weak governments and structural
budget deficits will produce a retreat from the policies that brought
inflation down. What the New Zealand cabinet reshuffle underlines is that
ministerial razor gangs across the OECD area are working with blunter
weapons. A first-world fiscal crisis before the end of the decade cannot be
ruled out.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Cool, creative and connected: Viacom's MTV cable network is
eyeing Europe and Asia for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Their names are Beavis and Butt-head, and they are cartoon characters with
their own show on MTV, the American pop music cable television channel that
is the jewel in the crown of Viacom, the media conglomerate which is
struggling to conclude a Dollars 9.5bn friendly bid for Paramount.
They are foul-mouthed, petty thieving, layabouts with a taste for pyromania,
torturing animals, jeering at the elderly and making crude comments about
women. They are also America's most popular teenage anti-heroes.
Sitting on a TV couch, they pass judgment on pop videos with a sniggering
laugh and a moronically limited vocabulary: anything good is 'cool';
anything bad 'sucks'.
But while Beavis and Butt-head seem puerile to sane adults over the age of
30, they have struck a chord among young Americans. The show is MTV's most
popular, while T-shirts featuring the duo are selling strongly, and movie
spin-offs are in the works.
'Never underestimate America's fascination with the under-achiever,' laughs
Mr Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks, the cable group to which MTV
belongs.
The show underscores MTV's ability to set, or stay abreast of, fashion
trends among the young - a capacity which has helped turn it into one of
America's most successful cable channels and a growing global presence.
It now reaches more than 233m homes in over 77 countries, with six
separately packaged regional services. The latest is MTV Latino, a 24
hour-a-day Spanish language network for Latin America launched with over 2m
subscribers early last month.
MTV is one of four channels making up MTV Networks. The others are trying to
follow in its international footsteps.
Nickelodeon, the most popular children's network in the US, made its first
foray abroad in September when it launched a joint venture in the UK with
British Sky Broadcasting - the first stage in what Viacom hopes will be a
global expansion similar to MTV's.
The two other channels will be launched in the UK early next year: Nick at
Nite, a channel which specialises in re-runs of classic television comedies,
and VH-1, which concentrates on pop music for the baby boomer age group.
MTV Networks' growing global reach is a factor in the Dollars 9.5bn battle
being fought by Viacom over Paramount Communications, the US film and
publishing group. For it gives some credence to Viacom's argument that a
merger agreed by the two would create a media business able to compete
internationally.
QVC Network, the cable television shopping channel launching a rival,
hostile offer for Paramount, makes similar claims as the battle moves
towards a final courtroom showdown. Last Wednesday the Delaware chancery
court ruled in favour of QVC by overturning a poison pill arrangement
designed to protect Viacom's agreed bid for Paramount. An appeal against the
ruling by both Viacom and Paramount is due to be heard on December 9.
Whether Viacom wins or loses, continued strong growth seems certain at MTV
Networks, which recently reported a 44 per cent jump in third-quarter
operating earnings and is expected to make Dollars 230m-Dollars 240m in
1993.
Its revenues come largely from advertisers and fees from cable and
broadcasting service companies carrying the programmes. In the US, about 65
per cent come from advertising, while the figure is about 90 per cent in
Europe.
MTV Networks' success thus depends on attracting the viewers advertisers
want to reach, which it does by combining three classic marketing skills:
careful branding; keeping close to the customer; and 'thinking globally,
while acting locally'.
Each channel has a strong brand image. This is partly because they are cable
networks, able to target a narrower audience than broadcast networks which
have to appeal to a wide range of viewers.
But MTV's success is due mainly to its knack of maintaining a distinctive
feel for each of its channels.
'Our strategy is to be a small niche player, so to prosper and survive it is
key we have the loyalty of our viewers. They have to feel this is a place
for them, that it speaks their language, that it resonates with them,' says
Mr Freston, a leading member of the team which set up the MTV music channel
in the US in 1981. Broadcast into more than 57m American homes, it has
become one of the most important arbiters of pop culture.
In recent years, MTV has helped reinforce its identity by supplementing its
basic diet of pop videos (provided virtually free by record companies) with
original programmes, such as Beavis and Butt-head. These now fill about 20
per cent of its air time, giving it the feel of an 'alternative' youth
channel.
Similarly, Nickelodeon, which reaches about 60m US homes and accounts for
about 30 per cent of the children's television pie, owes its success to a
viewpoint which permeates its programmes - that the channel belongs to its
young audience, rather than the alien world of adults. It likes to deflate
pretentious grown-ups, particularly by showering them with green slime.
'We had a big idea. Let's look at stuff from the kids' point of view, that
they are the consumer,' says Ms Geraldine Laybourne, channel head.
Rugrats, an award-winning cartoon series about babies, exaggerates sizes and
shapes to reflect a child's perspective. Clarissa Explains It All is a
situation comedy which examines the world through the eyes of a 14-year-old
girl.
MTV and Nickelodeon keep in close touch with customers. Each has a panel of
viewers, linked to the networks by computer, which can give instant feed
back on new shows.
The group's commitment to thinking globally, but tailoring its product to
local markets, is underscored in Europe, where the MTV music channel began
broadcasting in 1987 and recently went into profit.
It reaches 55m homes across the continent - Germany is the largest market -
with a service put together in London, which uses the English language but
is pan-European in tone. For example, some 40 per cent of the videos it
shows are from countries other than the UK and US, and its current affairs
programmes have tackled issues such as neo-fascism.
'An 18-year-old in Prague has more in common with an 18-year-old in Paris
than they do with their own parents,' argues Mr Bill Roedy, MTV Europe's
chief executive.
MTV Networks sees its strongest growth in Europe, where it still has many
homes to penetrate, and in the emerging Asian market.
It is developing its first feature film, an MTV spin-off called Joe's
Apartment, with Geffen Pictures, while Nickelodeon is developing video and
audio products with Sony. This year Nickelodeon expects to sell 8m dollops
of Gak, a slimy, kneading plaything made under licence by toy-maker Mattel.
Longer term, the fast-developing world of interactive multi-media, which
promises to put hundreds of channels into people's homes, should help the
company, since its networks can be easily sub-divided to reach ever more
closely targeted audiences. MTV, for example, is planning to test market two
new MTV channels, dedicated to different music formats.
However, the multi-media world, with its added channel capacity, will also
mean intensified competition. Nickelodeon already faces a tussle for viewers
with the likes of Walt Disney's (advertisement free) children's channel.
MTV faces no immediate threat to its dominance of the pop market, although
Bertelsmann of Germany and Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US cable
operator, recently announced unspecific plans for a new, interactive pop
music and shopping channel.
In a world where viewers have a bewildering multitude of choices, the key to
MTV's continued success will be maintaining its individuality and customer
loyalty.
And that, for better or worse, is likely to spawn plenty of successors to
Beavis and Butt-head, when their fickle young fans decide eventually that
they, too, 'suck'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your report, 'Chance of political deal should not be missed, say
executives' (November 29), the remarks attributed to me are accurate.
However, lest the report's introduction to my remarks and those of other
businessmen might unwittingly mislead, I wish to make clear that, in my
discussion with your interviewer, I adhered strictly to my practice of not
expressing a view on particular solutions to the Irish question in either
the short or the long term.
I was concerned to make two simple but fundamental points:
1. There are many possible political models, but each has to be judged by
the touchstone of workability. Any settlement, to be durable, must command
broad cross-community support.
2. There have been turning points in Northern Ireland which failed to turn.
This could prove to be another one unless the search for peace and stable
political arrangements is now pursued urgently to a decisive conclusion,
through a process of active negotiation involving all who are prepared to
commit themselves to the democratic process and who in their several ways
have a contribution to make to a solution.

employer has to guarantee that this will always be the case: even at the
expense of all of the shareholders' funds if that's what it takes.
How can company directors guarantee an inflation-related benefit at the
expense of shareholders without calling into question their own duties to
those shareholders and to their company? If this proposal finds itself on to
the statute books, then very many employees are going to find themselves in
pension schemes that are being wound up to be replaced by something that
does not require the guarantee of solvency. This will be to the detriment of
employees' expectations.
By all means have a solvency test and disclose to employees the result, but
it is unreasonable to expect someone to guarantee the future level of
benefits at the expense of somebody else.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: International safeguards for Thorp
reprocessing plant 'first class'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr R HOWSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Llew Smith complains that British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) has
repeatedly failed to provide him with a document on the international
safeguards arrangements for Thorp (Letters, November 23). I am completely
mystified by this.
The document, published by the European Commission, is a public document and
if he cares to ask me for one I will send it to him immediately. When Mr
Smith reads it, he will realise that the international safeguards
arrangements for Thorp are first class and will provide an extremely high
level of independent assurance that the nuclear material, all of which is
for peaceful, civil use, is under proper control.
Indeed, during an international conference in May 1993, senior Euratom
officials concluded that the safeguards techniques implemented in Thorp
provide '. . . a sound system of safeguards activities . . . ensuring that
this major industrial size reprocessing complex can be controlled under
international safeguards to provide a high degree of assurance'.
What else would you expect after an internal technical programme spanning 10
years, detailed discussions over seven years with Euratom concerning
implementation of safeguards, and a four-year international study (Lascar)
involving the US administration and the International Atomic Energy
Authority.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Modest plan for polls: Let Hong Kong's people decide how
China should be handled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The moment of truth for Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patten, has at last
arrived. Seven months of talks have left him scarcely any nearer agreement
with China than when he started, and time has run out. He has to introduce
legislation within the next week or two, enabling local elections to be held
next year. He can wait a bit longer, but at most a few months, before
tabling a bill to fix the arrangements for choosing a new Legislative
Council (LegCo) in 1995.
From a distance it seems strange that so much energy is being expended by
both sides on such small details. Why should China care what assembly is
elected in 1995, and by what method, when sovereignty reverts to it in 1997
anyway? And why should Britain bother to insist on a slightly more
representative LegCo for the last year and three quarters of its 150-year
rule?
The whole argument centres on the notion of the 'through train', under which
the LegCo elected in 1995 is supposed to stay in office through the transfer
of power, until 1999. The very fact that China is being so difficult about
the 1995 elections suggests that Mr Patten may be on to something. If the
Chinese leadership had no qualms about dissolving LegCo and derailing the
through train as soon as it gained sovereignty in Hong Kong, it would not
care what happened in 1995.
Clearly it does have qualms. It knows that in 1997 'the eyes of the world'
will be on Hong Kong. Not that it cares about the eyes of the world as such.
But there is good reason to suppose it does care about the eyes of the US
Congress, and also those of the population of Taiwan. Trade with the US, and
peaceful reunification of Taiwan with the mainland, are both important
elements in Chinese policy. Both could be severely damaged if China has to
begin its rule in Hong Kong by dismissing the chosen representatives of Hong
Kong's people. Such an act could well provoke mass demonstrations, which
might have to be suppressed with violence and even bloodshed. It would look
bad.
That doesn't mean it won't happen. It could hardly look worse than Tiananmen
Square in June 1989. If China's rulers believe an act of spectacular
repression is the only way to prevent Hong Kong infecting the rest of China
with instability, they are unlikely to shrink from it. But no doubt they
would rather avoid it.
Therefore their first preference was to win British co-operation in
procuring a docile LegCo in 1995. That Mr Patten seems determined to refuse.
Their next choice will probably be to use their influence in the existing
LegCo to emasculate Mr Patten's proposals on their way to the statute book.
To that, Mr Patten seems half resigned - to the extent that some Hong Kong
democrats suspect a secret Anglo-Chinese understanding to proceed that way,
giving China what it wants while saving Mr Patten's face.
The trouble with that conspiracy theory is that not much of Mr Patten's face
would be saved. He would still have to accept a humiliating defeat, and he
could not even claim convincingly that he was bowing to the wishes of the
people of Hong Kong. The defeat would be inflicted on him not by the
directly elected representatives of the people but by those of the
unreformed functional constituencies or 'rotten boroughs', controlled by
businessmen whose economic interests depend more and more obviously on
Beijing's goodwill. He would be cancelling Christmas after putting it to a
show of wings among the turkeys. That would not leave him with much
authority during the remaining three years of his term.
Those who say Mr Patten's policies involve risks for Hong Kong are right.
But Hong Kong democrats also have a point when they say it is for the people
of Hong Kong, rather than Britain, to decide whether those risks are worth
taking. The problem is that letting them decide would in itself involve
taking the risk.
Should Mr Patten put his proposals to a referendum? I think not. Even if
that did not provoke China to an extreme reaction, it would lead to a
polarised and confrontational debate in Hong Kong, leaving no room for
compromises. What is needed is an elected assembly, more representative than
the existing LegCo yet not prejudging, by its very existence, the issue in
dispute with China.
I have a suggestion. Why not hold elections now? Ordinary British-style
elections, one person one vote. No functional constituencies, 'election
committee' or other colonial nonsense. Hold them for an assembly with no
pretensions to last beyond 1997, but with an explicit mandate to advise the
governor how to run the colony, and how to deal with China, during the last
three years of British rule.
If the assembly advised Mr Patten to take risks, at least the risks would be
run by those giving the advice. If it advised him to accommodate Chinese
wishes, at least it would be clear that Britain was doing what the majority
of Hong Kong people wanted.
Of course, China would not like this idea. But that is not the main reason
why it will not be adopted. There is another thought, much more alarming to
the minds of ministers in Whitehall: the thought that such an assembly might
reopen the issue of right of abode in the UK for British passport-holders.
Granting that right is the one action still in Britain's power which would
offer security to people in Hong Kong after 1997. As long as the UK refuses
it, Mr Patten should not be surprised if Hong Kong residents are more and
more anxious to keep in Beijing's good books, and less and less interested
in the minutiae of an electoral system which is guaranteed not to last.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on transport in London points the route towards a more
logical method of financing the capital's transport system.
The proposed transport authority for London would be a more plausible
organisation if its functions were extended to cover responsibility for
financing any operating subsidiaries, as well as capital investment, and if
it covered all commuter services into London as well as the transport
services within London.
The performance and charges of the commuter services probably have more
influence than those of transport within London on the attractions of the
city as a place of business. The amount that businesses need to pay their
employees and the value of property in London will be linked to the level of
fares and therefore of subsidies.
The businesses and property owners are therefore the logical sources of any
subsidy to the commuter services, as well as services in London, whether for
operations or investment. So the transport authority would need the power to
levy a 'transport rate' on London business property, which should be an
addition to the standard business rate.
It would also need the power to contract for services with the operators of
British Rail's commuter services and with London Transport. Therefore, it
would take over some of the functions now placed with the franchising
director.
Amendments to the recent legislation on BR would be needed in the act
establishing a transport authority. Ministers might not be welcome such
changes, but they should consider the benefits of shedding responsibility
for transport in London. Local autonomy can have political as well as
economic advantages.

Sir, When I came to Canada in the early 1980s, a combined subway-bus token
cost 35 cents. Now it costs Dollars 1.30. This price has outperformed gold
and other inflation hedges. In London the rise in transport as a relative
price has been even greater.
Here is the answer to the problem of under-investment in transport in
south-east England. Your suggested mega-bond for London (Leader, November
29) should be denominated in zone one rides, and pay interest in zone one
rides, Network SouthEast season tickets, or cash equivalent.
A sum of Pounds 1,000 might buy a 1,000-ride bond offering 50 rides per
annum . . . somewhat like the Wimbledon tennis debentures.
Government need not come into it. A consortium of banks and construction
companies could issue a super financial derivative for Pounds 10bn. They
would negotiate project by project with whoever was running the transport
system: investment for rides of cash equivalent. Uninvested funds would be
placed in medium-dated gilts, from where they probably came in the first
place. It would be privatisation by the back door.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: Glasgow wins Scottish gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As anticipated, Glasgow has won the battle with Edinburgh to house the new
National Gallery of Scottish Art. It will rise in Kelvingrove Park and
should be ready in time for the Millennium. Indeed Millennium money,
directed via the national lottery, will be expected to provide much of the
Pounds 25m cost.
The National Gallery of Scottish Art will provide a home for a national
collection of pictures, decorative arts, and other objects associated with
the Scottish heritage. It will give expression to Scottish national feeling
and be the Scotland's project to celebrate the Millennium.
Glasgow won the fiercely fought contest with Edinburgh for the site mainly
because a consultants report suggested it would attract more visitors, some
750,000 a year. It was also successful because its local council fought
harder for the project. At the start, Edinburgh actually wanted to charge
the trustees Pounds 3m for their preferred local site, Dean Lodge, opposite
the Gallery of Modern Art.
In response Glasgow offered a choice of five locations, all free, and
promised loans to the new Gallery of its Charles Rennie Mackintosh
interiors, and works by the early 20th artists, the Glasgow Boys. It also
suggested that a site in Glasgow might attract an EC grant of Pounds 10m.
Among the architects with plans for the new Museum is Richard Rodgers.
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries, welcomed the choice.
'It will be the most exciting development for the visual arts in Scotland.'
He will use the extra gallery space to show some of the 70 per cent of stock
usually kept in the vaults. However paintings by the leading Scottish
artists, such as Ramsay and Raeburn, will still hang in the National Gallery
on the Mound in Edinburgh.
The choice of Kelvingrove puts a question mark over the future of the
National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. It will be expected to provide many
of its most popular pictures, and might seek a new role as a gallery devoted
to photography, sculpture or architecture.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: Gripped by 'Wild Things' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Physician, heal thyself. But who can heal the hospital system whereby our
psychiatric patients are treated? Anna Reynolds, author of the new play Wild
Things, speaks in a programme note of her time in a mixed ward of a
psychiatric hospital; and her play portrays the pathetic situation whereby
such patients are dealt with by partly insensitive and inadequate staff. At
the same time, however, it shows how patients start to help each other.
Gradually, it works through the hopeless tedium of everyday life in the
ward. Gradually, it becomes deeply affecting.
Wild Things - Reynolds's second play - is receiving its first performances
from the touring company Paines Plough in Salisbury. It has just four roles:
Dr Phoebe Trick (psychiatrist), Katie (nurse), Johnny (male patient who has
raped and killed a prostitute), and Diane (girl traumatised into silence by
the triple whammy of discovering her mother's body after suicide, of trying
to commit suicide herself, and of being pregnant). In the earlier scenes, we
need either writing that will make us sense the ward's larger life or
staging that will more tightly focus the quartet's internal dynamics. Later,
however, we are gripped.
Johnny's aggressive intelligence gives Dr Trick and Katie one set of
problems, and Diane's constant silence (she keeps switching into the
language of dance) another. Dr Trick is tired, prissy, and no communicator;
Katie is a blowsy loudmouth, hostile to Johnny and incapable of
comprehending Diane's silence.
The play's central irony is that the two patients understand each other
better than do their keepers. (For one thing, only Johnny has the instinct
to dance alongside Diane.) The play ends with Johnny at last releasing his
guilt and rage in bitter tears; and, though cynicism tells me that this
ending is too good to be true, the fact is that I was in tears too.
All too believable is the way that Dr Trick, having led Johnny to recount
the story of the rape and murder he committed, actually cuts him off before
he reaches the climax. And the degree to which Reynolds has entered Johnny's
mind is very fine; she catches his uncanny ability to read thoughts, and the
need to love and be loved that is at the root of his crime.
Jennifer Scott-Malden, as Diane, and Christopher McHallem, as Johnny, give
excellent performances. Her silence and grace are perfectly contrasted with
his noisiness and violence; and the pain of both is equally real. Holly de
Jong catches all the clinical limitations of Dr Trick; and though Joy
Elias-Rilwan misses some of the nurse's anti-male nervous system, she has
her well-meaning insensitivity and chattiness. Geraldine Pilgrim's designs
effectively change to show different parts of the ward. Deborah Paige, the
director, must be responsible for the staging's major virtues and its minor
weaknesses.
Two particular strengths of this play make me look forward to any future
play Reynolds may go on to write. Wild Things sees all its characters as
rounded, complex and self-contradictory people. And it has shafts of poetry
that pierce through its basic prose. At the end, Diane says to Johnny
'You're a blind man, stumbling through a minefield, hoping for the worst.'
The metaphor perfectly sums him up; coming from Diane, it takes our breath
away.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: When political correctness is all - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's schedules were chock-a-block with Aids programmes. Tomorrow
Channel 4 runs more than three hours of Aids programmes. But today there
seem to be no Aids programmes, which is ironic because today is World Aids
Day. Painfully slowly television's treatment of Aids is beginning to change,
but it is an uphill move against entrenched dogma, amour propre and, most
resistant af all, political correctness. Until recently the aim of most Aids
programmes has been, first, to demonstrate the compassion of the producers
and presenters, and, second, to prove that they are not homophobic. Dare to
express the smallest reservations about their assertions that 'Aids is
equally dangerous to everyone, heterosexual as much as homosexual' and you
will be accused of homophobia.
Knee-jerk response programmes are still being made. ITV's Speakeasy Aids
Special on Friday, shown in London and the Midlands, simply began from the
familiar set of assumptions, going out to a nightclub full of young people
'on the pull' to ask whether they were carrying condoms. They found just one
who did, thus bearing out the recent report from a contraceptive
manufacturer (who would doubtless like to increase sales) that only seven
per cent of young people wear condoms with a new sexual partner. Had the
natural journalistic response occurred to the programme makers, they might
have asked: 'Why are people behaving in this way if it is really as risky as
television has always said; could it be that we cried wolf five years ago
when we claimed that within a short time everyone in a major city would know
a heterosexual dying of Aids?' Instead they continued with their
nudge-nudge, wink-wink routine: 'Would you have sex on a first date?' and
'Have you got a condom?'
Aids In A New Light 93, also shown on ITV, this time late on Saturday
evening, was an example of even greater laziness. Instead of making a
programme about Aids in Britain, London Weekend bought a secondhand American
programme about the situation in the US. After Elizabeth Taylor's
introductory assertion that the rate of infection is rising sharply every
day, especially among young people and women, other presenters, presumably
famous in the US, came on to declare 'We gotta tell America]' and 'Americans
are very sexy people]' This was not journalism, seeking to tell the truth,
so much as propaganda endeavouring to make a case by selective assertion.
The 'compassionate celebrity' way of covering the subject, with film stars
and disc jockeys adopting deeply concerned expressions as they roll condoms
on to their fingers, is presumably used because television does not dare to
get to the nitty gritty of the Aids phenomenon: sexual practices which are
not usually mentioned in polite society. Among the scores, probably
hundreds, of Aids programmes so far screened I have never yet seen one which
had the courage to say that (leaving aside infected blood banks and needle
sharing) the disease appears to spread where you find (a) a group of
abnormally promiscuous people (b) where anal intercourse is commonplace or
even the dominant practice, the lining of the rectum being more prone to
rupture than the lining of the vagina, allowing the spread of the infection
into the bloodstream, and (c) where either drug abuse or old venereal
diseases weaken resistence to Aids or even provide a vector for the new
disease. Where these three factors coincide, whether among heterosexuals or
homosexuals, Aids will spread quickly unless preventive measures are taken.
As it happens such circumstances have arisen in western industrialised
countries chiefly, if not exclusively, among the gay community. Hence 'gay
plague'.
The preceding paragraph is not a moral judgment, nor a condemnation of any
group. It is a statement of the facts as perceived after reading everything
about Aids that it was possible to lay hands on and which was comprehensible
to the layman. But if you expressed it on one of television's Aids
programmes there would be an outcry, not from the audience, but from the
'agenda setters'. These people - producers, editors, heads of television
departments - believe that it is wrong to tell the public the truth about
Aids because, in their view, the public is already appallingly careless
about 'safe sex' and dreadfully homophobic. Tell viewers the truth and the
heterosexual majority will take this as a signal to forget all thought of
danger to themselves, abandon 'safe sex", and increase the persecution of
homosexuals. In television today it is more important to be seen to be
politically correct than to be seen to be truthful.
And yet things are beginning to look up. To be fair there has always been
one notable exception to the rule: from the beginning Joan Shenton, a lone
independent producer, working with her own company, Meditel, has stuck
insistently to the old idea of journalism, reporting whatever she finds. As
with any subject where there is one overwhelming school of thought and a
number of fringe dissenters you run the risk of becoming identified wholly
and only with the dissenters. Because they are the underdogs and receive so
little attention elsewhere you tend to concentrate on them in an instinctive
attempt to right the balance, whereupon the dominant group anathematises you
and drives you more into exclusive concentration on the fringe.
This is no bad thing, of course, if you see your position as being like that
of Copernicans under the Roman Catholic church or dissidents in Soviet
Russia. Being told 'Any fool can see the sun goes round the earth and your
denial makes you an atheist' or 'any fool can see communism works and your
denial makes you a lunatic' must sound to Shenton very much like 'any fool
can see HIV causes Aids, the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa proves that
homosexuality is not a factor, AZT is a useful treatment, and your denial
makes you a homophobe'. Previously her work has been shown on Channel 4, but
her Diary Of An Aids Dissident was screened on Monday by Sky News. It told
us more about the propaganda war than about Aids itself, but the revelation
that members of the Aids establishment are now so nervous that they try to
suppress dissident publications suggests that we may be near to a
breakthrough of the truth in the larger public domain.
The weekend also brought The Broadcast Tapes Of Dr Peter, an edited version
of a long sequence of brief reports made for Canadian television by Dr Peter
Jepson-Young, who died of Aids last year. Watching the progress of the
disease and this man's reaction to it was, surprisingly, a most moving and
uplifting experience. He met blindness with apparent calm and set about
learning to play the piano. He acquired a guide dog, then had to resort to a
wheelchair with the dog trotting alongside. He organised a 'live will' and
discussed the details of his own death with family and friends, joking about
spending his final hours in a four-poster bed with velvet covers. His
reports were not always so upbeat, but as an exhibition of the strength of
the human spirit this was an extraordinary programme.
Best of all, perhaps, in terms of journalism - though we shall have to see
more before being certain - is Channel 4's set of four documentaries, The
Plague, made by George Carey and Ann Moir, of the independent company
Barraclough Carey. The opening episode, 'Zero Factor', looked back to the
early 1980s and the emergence of a terrifying unknown disease among the
homosexual communities which used the bath houses in California and Fire
Island in New York. By tracking the people centrally involved (not just
sufferers, but public health officials and volunteer workers) the producers
created one of those real-life detective stories which are almost
embarrassingly gripping, given that we know the outcome and the seriousness
of the subject.
If this series brings the same sort of workmanlike approach to such matters
as the African phenomenon and even to the over-arching question of the
relationship between HIV and Aids, then television will at last be able to
start holding up its head in an area where, previously, it should have hung
it in shame.

It may be necessary to restrain FT ballet critic Clement Crisp during
tonight's three-hour Winter Gala marking the centenary of Tchaikovsky's
death. Not only is contortionist Sylvie Guillem dancing, but her piece, 'La
Luna', was choreographed by Maurice Bejart, one of Crisp's betes noires.
Other dancers include Leanne Benjamin and Tetsuya Kumakawa in excerpts from
'Nutcracker", and Darcey Bussell and Zoltan Solymosi in a Balanchine pas de
deux. Singers include Placido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa (BBC2, 7.30 ).
You might have thought it paradoxical that a visual medium such as
television should draw so many of its 'personality' presenters from among
those with weird voices, yet it is so: think of David Bellamy and Lloyd
Grossman. Now art critic Brian Sewell, who sounds like a walking parody of
Noel Coward, is joining their ranks. He presents Travelog and 'goes in
search of the art of Bavaria, taking in the perils of Munich's one-way
system and the castles of Ludwig II, the 'mad king', on his way to the
galleries and exhibitions' (C4, 8.30).

FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: An exciting new trio - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a splendid new piano trio (in the classical sense: piano, violin,
cello) to watch out for, which we heard in the Queen Elizabeth Hall on
Monday. The 'Pires-Dumay-Hoffman' Trio pursues its musical goals with
unanimous sympathy as well as sharp individual character and expertise -
just what we needed, as the Beaux Arts Trio edges toward retirement.
The senior member is the pianist Maria Joao Pires (50 next year), who has
won the hearts of London audiences ever since she took up her
long-interrupted career again. Recently she has formed a notable duo with
Augustin Dumay, whom I would place among the strongest, most stylish,
thoughtful and brilliantly equipped violinists of our day - though his
reputation in Britain does not stretch far yet. Now the younger American
cellist Gary Hoffman, who won the Rostropovich Competition seven years ago,
has joined them.
I slightly regretted the changes in their programme as originally
advertised. Instead of Mozart's K564 trio in G (which they should have
played beautifully) and the Schubert E-flat (where they might have been too
fastidious to relish its earthy, gemutlich cheerfulness), we got an extra
violin-and-piano exhibit - the K379 sonata in G, delivered with relaxed,
graceful mock-simplicity - and an extra showpiece for Hoffman. That was
Schubert's 'Arpeggione' Sonata, where he was scrupulous and subtle but
ultra-polite, while Pires suppressed her accompaniment to a modest
vanishing-point. He swung his shoulders in the dance-passages, and even
tapped his foot, but if you closed your eyes the music danced only in the
coolest, most decorous way.
The one piece retained from the original bill was the third violin sonata of
Brahms, in D minor. In that, Dumay and Pires made an inspired departure from
the standard reading. By contrast with its vernal, just-earlier companions
in A major and G (they are all 'late' works), this op. 108 is usually
presented as a Sturm und Drang exercise. But the performers reserved 'storm
and stress' for the Finale; the opening Allegro was rivettingly quiet and
'inward' - not stormy at all, but sober and searching to a great depth,
wonderful to hear.
The trio concluded with the Brahms C major, op. 87. The ingenious
workings-out were rendered transparent, but rather temperate. It would have
been satisfying to hear the real energy of Brahms's material displayed in
franker, rumbustious life; Pires-Dumay-Hoffman spelled it out in scrupulous
detail, but it never took fire until the lusty final coda. Nonetheless,
after another year or two of mutual adjustment this trio might be the
leading ensemble in its repertoire.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: Glass meets Poe in the House of Usher - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five or six years ago the minimalist composer Philip Glass took a break from
writing monster stage-pieces, to devise (with Arthur Yorinks) a chamber
opera after one of Edgar Allan Poe's most famous horror tales. The Fall of
the House of Usher had its premiere in Cambridge, Mass., in 1988; the
following summer, Music Theatre Wales staged it at the Vale of Glamorgan
Festival. Last week they revived it for the Huddersfield Festival of
Contemporary Music, and it is touring southward to reach the Queen Elizabeth
Hall on December 18.
I caught up with it in the Oxford Playhouse on Sunday. Michael McCarthy's
efficient production fitted the stage well, with Richard Aylwin's chunky set
suggesting both hi-tech cruelties and the gloom of a Victorian pile - it
doubles as Roderick Usher's library and the family vault, with plenty of
stage mist. The neurasthenic Roderick, as you may remember, is the last of
his line, devoted (possibly incestuously) to his fey sister Madeline.
She dies, and is duly interred - but she is not quite dead. In one of Poe's
craziest, most overwrought visions, a friend of Roderick's reads from an
ancient epic over weirdly apposite sound-effects, the sounds of Madeline
struggling out of coffin and vault to expire at last on her brother's
breast: cue fall of House.
The grip of the original tale depends upon the wild efflorescence of Poe's
language. For operatic purposes, of course, most of that has to go. When
Debussy set out to make a one-acter of it, the music instead was to recreate
the haunted atmosphere. It is a tribute to Glass's indomitable chutzpah that
with Debussy's fragments now recovered, filled out by other hands and
staged, he should set the story in his own chugging style, as much brutalist
as minimalist.
Endlessly repeated chords and arpeggios, mostly bland and diatonic: the odd
'wrong' note is slipped into the harmony for piquancy, but it never leads
anywhere. One half-expected that the Glass manner might suit the obsessive
character of the tale, but despite the 12-strong band and a keen conductor,
Michael Rafferty, the effect is soon soporific - except when the volume is
rudely turned up to make climaxes. Early Glass used to be altogether more
interesting.
The plot does not bear stretching over two acts (two hours with interval).
The principals - Julian Pike as Roderick, Anne-Margrethe Elkaas as Madeline,
Gwion Thomas as the faceless friend - strove ably to invest their plain
vocal lines with intensity and character beyond what the music contains.
Glassophiles may detect more virtue in this piece than I could do; well,
they will get their chance on the South Bank.

FT  01 DEC 93 / People: Lehman Brothers International
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ruth Lea, Mitsubishi Bank's ubiquitous chief UK economist, is moving to
Lehman Brothers International in the new year as its chief UK economist.
Lea, 46, has arguably become one of the City's best-known economic pundits
with the British public because of her frequent appearances on television
and radio and her ability to explain and analyse economic developments in
layman's terms.
By her own admission, Lea 'loves talking'. Perhaps her most memorable quote
so far, made on Black Wednesday when sterling was kicked out of the ERM,
was: 'The ironic thing is that we may get an economic recovery because the
government's policies have failed.'
Lea, who has been with Mitsubishi for five years, will join the economics
team headed by Lehman's chief economist Gerald Holtham. She will take over
Peter Spencer's job which became vacant 18 months ago when he moved to
Kleinwort Benson.
Before joining Mitsubishi, Lea worked at the DTI for four years and before
that spent five years at the Central Statistical Office. She also spent four
years at the Treasury in the 1970s.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: On the road to cleaner air -
US companies are offering commuting staff incentives to leave their cars at
home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day, Doris Bouton of Vitro, the California-based defence group, makes
her rounds of the company's offices with a bag of sweets in her hand and
asks employees how they travelled to work. If they say they walked, rode
their bike or shared a ride with another employee, she gives them a sweet.
If they say they made a solo trip in their car, she says 'Shame on you]' and
moves on to the next desk. 'It may sound silly,' says Bouton, the company's
transport co-ordinator, 'but it works]'
Her daily scolding shows the efforts that many companies are making to
comply with new laws forcing them to cut down on the number of cars their
employees drive to work. The legislation, part of the 1990 Clean Air Act
Amendments, is an attempt to reduce car emissions in the US. Starting next
year, companies with more than 100 employees will have to submit plans to
reduce the use of what are referred to as 'single occupancy vehicles'.
The US is slowly coming to grips with one of its biggest environmental
hazards: excessive car use. 'More people are driving than ever before and
they are driving longer distances,' says Martha Casey, a spokesperson for
the Environmental Protection Agency, which is helping to implement the new
rules.
'This legislation is an attempt to change people's commuting habits.'
Ten metropolitan areas are targeted in the amendments: Los Angeles, San
Diego, the Southeast Desert (next to San Francisco and including Silicon
Valley), Ventura County, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Houston
and Milwaukee. The legislation should have an even wider impact, however, as
other states, attempting to comply with reduced emissions standards, pass
similar laws.
With the implementation of the new rules, environmental regulation in the US
will move to a new level. Previously, companies only had to worry about the
amount of pollution their factories created. Now, they will also be
responsible for the pollution their employees create on the way to work.
Even service companies, which were once outside the environmental debate,
suddenly find themselves under the watchful eye of the EPA.
President Bill Clinton stepped up the pressure in October with a list of
rules to help the country cut down on emissions. One presidential suggestion
is that companies providing free parking to employees should offer cash
equivalents as an alternative benefit. Compliance with the rules will be
voluntary, although the administration has threatened to make them
enforceable by law if necessary.
Prising solo commuters away from their cars has shown itself to be a
Herculean task. Attempts by public institutions over the last two decades to
influence behaviour - by creating special car pool and bus lanes, for
instance - have proved hopelessly inadequate.
'For most of this century, cars have been a key part of the American dream,'
says Pamela Couch, transportation programme administrator for Ventura County
in California. 'Governments have subsidised highway travel and generally
ignored public transportation. It's very difficult to change a country's
habits overnight.'
Exacerbating the problem is the lack of adequate public transport in many of
the target regions. Companies complain that this is making it difficult for
them to comply with the regulations. 'It's just not feasible to get here
with a bus or train,' says Jack Gundrum, head of transport administration
for Textron, the aerospace company, in Connecticut. 'That means we have to
look at other alternatives.'
Success is measured in terms of 'average vehicle ridership' (AVR) - the
ratio of the number of cars driven to work to the number of employees. Most
companies in the target areas have AVRs of about 1.1 - that is, nearly every
employee is a solo car commuter. The legislation's goal is an AVR of 1.5.
Compressed working weeks and increased telecommuting (working from home) are
options that many companies are adopting to cut down on car usage. 'We have
to take a fresh look at the scheduling of work, at when and where it takes
place,' says Peter Valk, president of Transportation Management Services, a
consulting group. 'Moving to four 10-hour days is popular, and so is
allowing more employees to spend at least one or two days a week working
from home.'
Car-pooling is a main focus. Companies encourage this by putting employees
in touch with each other. Zip-code parties, in which people from the same
area meet in the office to discover ways of helping each other get to work
and car-pool databases have become popular. Car poolers are also rewarded
with benefits such as priority parking spaces and free petrol.
Some companies - such as Amgen, the Californian biotechnology group - offer
vans free of charge to car poolers. Company lotteries, in which all car
poolers get a chance to win small prizes, are also used as an incentive.
Setting a good example at the higher ranks is essential, say transport
managers. 'The vice-president of our company is a regular car pooler,' says
Bouton of Vitro. 'He also gave up his personal parking space at the company
to set the tone for the other employees.'
One innovation is 'guaranteed ride home' programmes. 'We found that one
reason people didn't want to car pool was that they were worried that if
their child got sick, or if they had to work late, they wouldn't be able to
get home,' says James Ferro, transport manager for Xerox Corporation. 'So we
provide a few vehicles which employees can use in case of an emergency.'
Other companies are exploring ways to link up with public transport, either
by providing shuttles to nearby train stations or by uniting with other
companies in the area to offer a limited bus service. Companies located near
public transport facilities often offer subsidies for bus and subway fares.
In fact the ultimate solution, according to transport experts, may be to
locate companies closer to public transport in the first place.
'I think better site planning, which takes commuting options into account
early on, is something that will happen in the future,' says Margaret
Heatherington of Metropool, which advises companies on commuting issues in
Connecticut.
Company managers, however, think that site planning will be used as a last
resort. 'It's a simple matter of whether the higher rent outweighs the
improvement in AVR rates,' said Valk of Transportation Management Services.
As an alternative, many companies suggest that public transport be built to
accommodate them. 'We are hoping that public transportation will improve in
this area,' says Marcia Brandt, employee transport co-ordinator for Amgen.
'And that's a possibility. With more voters now worried about public
transportation, it may become a bigger issue in the voting booth.'
Companies which have implemented new commuting programmes have achieved some
success, moving to AVRs of about 1.3 or more. Still, most find the AVR goal
of 1.5 elusive. 'We found that the first improvements were easy, but after
that we levelled out,' says Ferro of Xerox, which has had transport
programmes in place for several years.
'There's always a hard-core group that you can't get through to,' comments
Couch of the Ventura County Control District. 'Some people think driving a
car is downright American and they hang on tenaciously.'
One barrier to real improvement, say transport managers, is that the new
federal rules are not binding. In most areas, legislation is worded so that
companies must make only a 'convincing effort' to improve their AVRs.
Yet, whether or not companies achieve the magic 1.5 AVR soon, the
legislation has led them to take a hard look at their employees' commuting
habits. In the US government's fight to reduce car usage, the private sector
is now set to play a key role.

Mike Ruda, deputy managing director of News International, has resigned as a
director and left the company after nearly 25 years' service.
Ruda, former group marketing director, is 63, and all the signs are that the
parting was amicable. He will continue to be available for advice on
advertising and marketing.
Ruda has spent his entire newspaper career working for newspapers that
Rupert Murdoch either owned or was to acquire; he started off at the Daily
Herald from 1954, a Labour-supporting paper which eventually became the Sun.
He joined Murdoch in January 1969 as advertisement manager when he acquired
control of The News of the World.
By 1974 he was advertisement director of News Group Newspapers; he joined
the News International board in 1988 and became deputy managing director two
years ago.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Oil groups and troubled waters
 -Green issues versus commercial realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine you are the chairman of one of the world's largest oil companies. In
the middle of October, a letter arrived, demanding, among other things, that
you immediately stop all exploration and drilling of oil and gas reserves.
The letter's author is Paul Gilding, the Amsterdam-based executive director
of Greenpeace International, one of the world's largest environmental
pressure groups.
Reasons why it might be unwise to dispose of the letter spring to mind. You
worry that environmental lobbying may influence planning applications and
lead to tighter regulation. You also want to head off any chance of the
'direct action' which has made Greenpeace's reputation; for example recently
four inflatable dinghies launched from Greenpeace's boat Solo hung a banner
from an exploration rig operated by Shell in the Barents Sea. So how should
you respond?
'With interest but with some dismay', British Petroleum told Gilding.
'Unrealistic and not a helpful contribution to the debate', Shell
International Petroleum said in a response which stressed the company's care
for the environment.
However Greenpeace is adamant that its demands, fired off to more than 20
companies and industry groups, are not unreasonable. The threat of global
warming, its letter says, 'is too great for any of us to continue the
massive burning of fossil fuels'. At last year's Rio Earth Summit,
governments pledged to find ways of curbing carbon dioxide emissions from
burning fossil fuels, following warnings from the United Nations
intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC).
Greenpeace's international oil campaigner, Paul Horsman, argues the oil
companies are 'worse villains' than governments. In his view, 'they have
been involved in amazing lobbying against the Rio commitments and proposals
such as energy taxes'. He wants them to divert some of their research and
development budget to 'renewable' energy sources such as solar, wind and
wave power.
To oil companies, many of whom conduct research into renewables, these
demands ignore commercial realities. Michael Herbert, head of external
affairs at Shell International Petroleum, says that 'the cost of renewables
is still colossal - rapidly phasing out fossil fuels is not credible if we
are to meet the world's rising demand for energy, including that of
developing countries'. However nuclear power, one of the available
alternatives to fossil fuels, is anathema to Greenpeace.
Some oil companies also feel that Greenpeace misrepresents the available
scientific evidence on global warming and assumes, in BP's words, 'that
scientific consensus is far greater than it actually is'. While the IPCC is
scrupulous about not being drawn into this kind of dispute, it does
emphasise the uncertainties of its projections.
David Bennetts, research co-ordinator of the Hadley Centre in Berkshire,
England, which co-ordinates the IPCC's scientific assessments, says: 'It is
certainly true (as Greenpeace claims) that you cannot burn the world's
proven reserves of oil without the world warming. But what I cannot tell you
is whether that rate of warming would be fast enough to be dangerous'.
Outside observers might see this as a predictable standoff between natural
opponents. But the Greenpeace letter also carries a curiously dated air.
Some environmentalists and businessmen feel that as pollution regulation has
been tightened over the past decade - much of it due to the efforts of
environmental pressure groups - the venom has been taken out of the
traditional battle between greenery and smokestacks.
It is hard not to have some sympathy with Shell's view that 'Rio spelled out
the dilemmas facing the world', particularly the hard choices between the
environment and economic development. 'It is these dilemmas we should be
worrying about - it is unhelpful to go back to confrontation'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / People: Drummond leaves Grosvenor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Drummond, chairman of Grosvenor Venture Managers, has stepped down
following a disagreement over the future direction that the company is to
take.
Drummond, who joined Grosvenor three years ago, still retains a 49.2 per
cent holding in the venture capital company though the long term future of
this holding is now uncertain.
Drummond, who is 47, is probably better known than most venture capitalists
because of his appearance in a BBC2 television series featuring Grosvenor, a
medium-sized company based in Slough.
The aim of the programmes, which appeared at the beginning of this year, was
to explain the workings of venture capital.
The timing of the series, called the Adventurers, was embarrassing for
Grosvenor because it coincided with the company's unsuccessful attempt to
raise Pounds 60m from institutions. At the end of the series it was clear
that Grosvenor had only raised Pounds 7m. Both sides deny that the TV
exposure was behind Drummond's decision to quit.
Drummond has spent more than 20 years in the venture capital industry with
prominent players such as 3i, Alta Berkeley Associates and County NatWest
Ventures. He went to Electra Kingsway in 1989 but after only a short stay
moved to Grosvenor the following year.
He is now determined that when he goes back into the venture business he
will be working for himself. 'I want to be the boss,' he says.
His place as chairman has been taken by Bill Edge, 57, a Grosvenor veteran
who has been with the company since its inception in 1981. Edge initially
went into his family business, which made household chemicals and medicines,
until it was taken over by Reckitt and Colman. He subsequently worked for
Wyeth Laboratories and S&amp;W Berisford.

FT  01 DEC 93 / People: Telspec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Telspec, the telephone equipment company being floated tomorrow, has managed
to secure the services of 77-year-old ex-Cable &amp; Wireless chairman Lord
Sharp as a non-executive director.
Sharp (right) is chairman of Stanhope Properties and a non-executive
director of Carlton but says he has been seduced back into
telecommunications by the 'excitement of a developing area'. The company,
meanwhile, hopes to be able to avail itself of his excellent connections in
the Far East.
He was approached informerly by an old colleague, Paul Skey, who had been
principal telephone consultant at C&amp;W, and a director of the group's
subsidiary or associate com-panies in Jamaica, Macau and Botswana. Skey had
been a director of the pre-flotation Telspec for the past year.
When Sharp agreed to come aboard, Skey stepped aside, though he remains a
director of Telspec Europe. 'We didn't want to upset BT by having two C&amp;W
directors on the board,' is how Telspec chief executive Garth Riley puts it.
British Telecom is one of Telspec's principal customers.
The other non-executive director is 54-year-old John Rose, managing partner
of chartered accountants Hays Allan. He had worked for Telspec between 1980
and 1991 before it changed its auditors to Price Waterhouse because it felt
it needed a firm with an international presence.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Management: Who will buy the Citizen's Charter? - The global
market for UK ideas of public service reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is probably too soon to say that the Citizen's Charter has won popular
acclaim in the UK. It will take many more years to convince the sceptics
that the government's initiative for improving the quality of public
services is more than a cosmetic exercise.
But there is considerable interest throughout the world in the ideas behind
the charter, and in ways of making public services more responsive to their
customers. From Argentina to Zimbabwe, governments are looking for ways of
improving service quality while bearing down on costs.
And with Britain ahead of the field, at least for the moment, selling the
know-how of the Citizen's Charter offers a new export industry for
management consultants and training organisations.
Peninah Thomson, a management consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountants, has already sold the idea to Kuwait. For the last year, she and
a team of consultants have been helping Kuwaiti ministers and civil servants
think more about their customers.
Thomson is convinced that the charter approach could be a valuable invisible
export. 'We've invented a better mousetrap in public administration,' she
says. 'The world is beating a path to our door.
'Kuwait could have chosen an American model of admini-stration, but chose
ours instead.'
Further work may follow in other Gulf countries, such as Dubai, which have
seen what the initiative means in Kuwait. The government of Hong Kong has
also run a programme to improve the quality of its public services.
Ripa International, part of the Capita Group, is another training and
consultancy company which helps public administrators learn the charter
techniques for use in their own countries. Sierra Leone, South Korea and
Indonesia are among 60 countries which have sent civil servants on courses
to learn more about UK government reforms.
This week, a group of fast-stream trainees from the Polish civil service is
in London for training, a symptom of the growing interest in better quality
public services in eastern Europe.
The Cabinet Office unit which manages the Citizen's Charter has received a
stream of queries from more than 40 countries interested in the UK approach.
According to Diana Goldsworthy, the unit's deputy director, these range from
'the guy from Zimbabwe who wants an hour to chat about improving public
services, to the South Australian state government which has unveiled its
own Citizen's Charter.'
Close links have also been developed with the US, where vice-president Al
Gore heads a drive to 'reinvent' the federal government machine.
A two-day conference on Service for the Citizen, staged by the unit last
December, attracted participants from more than 20 countries. A second
conference next month will compare the experience of Australia and the US
with that of the UK and other European countries.
What impresses other governments is the simplicity of the UK approach.
'There's no high-flown theory behind the Citizen's Charter,' says
Goldsworthy. 'It simply looks at the needs of the consumer of public
services and finds ways of satisfying those needs.
'It is pragmatic and flexible, and it hasn't required a great deal of
legislation to implement it. The unit manages the charter as a project,
using techniques which can be transplanted anywhere.'
Thomson believes that more could be done to sell British expertise abroad.
Greater collaboration is needed between the Cabinet Office which has
developed the ideas, the Foreign Office which represents Britain overseas
and the companies which can help in implementing Citizen's Charter-type
programmes.
'There's a huge interest out there in something Britain's got to offer,' she
says. 'We need to work together so that more countries can buy the UK model
of public sector reform.'

FT  01 DEC 93 / Management: When seniority is replaced by merit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even if it confirmed a trend which had already started, the lead article
several weeks ago on the front page of the Nikkei, Japan's national economic
daily, is likely to have shaken many loyal Japanese businessmen.
Nissan, Japan's second largest vehicle maker, it reported, would abolish
seniority-based pay for nearly 3,000 managers and would be putting them on a
performance-related pay scheme.
The news that one of Japan's most prominent industrial groups was planning
to do away with the cherished tradition of seniority was a clear signal to
Japan's hard-working salarymen that the secure life of ever-rising incomes
could no longer be taken for granted.
Nissan is not alone in trying to restructure its salary system. A growing
number of Japanese companies is experimenting with schemes that allow
salaries to reflect better an employee's performance. Fujitsu, for example,
is trying to do this with the bonuses its managers receive twice a year.
Honda, the car maker, adopted an annual salary system last year whereby pay
is linked to performance in the previous year. The trend is being spurred by
changes in the Japanese economy and in the working environment, says
Haruyoshi Nishio, general manager in the Human Resources Department at
Marubeni, the trading house.
The Japanese system of paying employees according to seniority worked well
for companies while the economy was growing. It fostered corporate loyalty
and allowed companies to repay that loyalty in the form of increasing
salaries. Seniority was also a method of assessing an employee's
contribution to the company and complemented the Japanese belief in the
value of experience and in wisdom in old age.
But it also created a cosy environment in which mediocrity was condoned.
Since employees' basic salary increased each additional year they worked
with the company, there was little incentive, in terms of pay, to do more or
better.
Katsuhiko Sato, deputy general manager of the company's personnel
department, points out the maturing of the Japanese economy and the ageing
population have undermined the seniority-based pay system in recent years.
At the same time, length of service and hours of work do not necessarily
lead to better performance in a world where value-added work has
increasingly taken over from mass-volume production.
'It may have been true with factory work in the past but is not necessarily
true with many of the jobs performed today,' says Yuri Momomoto, manager of
public relations at Fujitsu. 'In software, for example, some people can
write a programme in a few days while others will take weeks.'
Better employee motivation obviously lies at the heart of many of the
changes. But companies are conscious of the need to ensure that performance
is measured as objectively and fairly as possible. To do so they have
introduced systems for employees to agree performance targets with their
superiors and jointly assess the results at the end of the fiscal year. In
public relations, for example, a department head might agree with a superior
to approach new publications, or sponsor innovative seminars to spread
knowledge of the company and its products. At the end of the year, they
would discuss whether these targets had been successfully reached. Setting
such targets not only provides managers with some objective measurement for
performance but also helps to clarify an employee's job aims.
'During the years of high growth, the goal was always the same and very
clear: to sell more products,' says Shin Tanaka, manager of public relations
at Honda. 'But as growth has slowed, the goal is no longer as clear and that
is why the productivity of white collar workers seems so low.'
One lingering fear even among companies that have embraced
performance-related pay, is that the greater emphasis on individual
performance could destroy the group harmony that has served Japanese
companies so well in the past.
Nevertheless, the move by some companies to introduce merit as a barometer
for pay indicates Japanese employment practices face a significant turning
point as companies struggle to adapt to an economic environment markedly
different from the growth years that formed the basis for those practices in
the first place.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Management: Costly burden of tradition - Japan's custom of
lifetime employment in return for total loyalty is being questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate Japan's social contract, of a job for life in return for perpetual
loyalty, is coming under question from both sides.
A growing number of industrial companies are seeking job reductions among
their loyal staff, or moving redundant people to other divisions, in an
attempt to cut wage costs during the recession. For them, the tradition of
lifetime employment is becoming a costly burden as the rising yen pushes up
costs against foreign competitors.
At the same time, more employees, especially the young, are starting to
accord more importance to their own interests than the company's. Only 20
per cent of staff over 50 have any other interest in life beyond working for
the company, but this rises to 38 per cent for 30-year-olds and 43 per cent
for 20-year-olds, according to a survey by the Economic Planning Agency.
A look at how the management of two very different groups, Toyota, Japan's
largest car maker and Mitsubishi Materials, a leading metals and ceramics
supplier, respond to these pressures shows that employment structures are at
the start of a slow evolutionary change.
Toyota started to adjust the social contract last June, when it shifted 20
per cent of its 4,000 white collar administrators into new project
divisions, such as strategic planning, environmental assessment or working
with suppliers.
The move, part of a wider cost-cutting drive, involved no redundancies as
might have been the case if Toyota were a western car maker, so it is only a
minor adjustment to the social contract. But it is the first time that
Toyota has asked staff to take such a step. 'The moves are still at an early
stage, but there have been no special difficulties,' says Iwao Isomura,
vice-president for personnel.
In parallel, Toyota is seeking to employ more people who will stay with the
group for only a short time, to improve cost flexibility and to gain access
to experts in technologies new to the car industry. 'Maybe it is a good idea
to have two types of employees, a stock type and a flow type,' says Tatsuro
Toyoda, group president. Although the company regularly employs temporary
seasonal workers at its factories, as one of Japan's blue-chip companies,
lifetime employment would be the rule for its white collar staff.
Putting this philosophy into practice will, however, be very slow. The
Japanese education system does not favour the type of person who wishes to
map out his own career, says Isomura.
Moreover, flexible employment can only work at Toyota if other Japanese
companies follow suit, so that staff on the move can find new jobs
elsewhere. A handful are thinking along the same lines, including Sony, a
perennial Japanese management trendsetter. But some older industrial
companies believe Japan should not challenge traditional employment
structures lightly.
Mitsubishi Materials is a classic example. 'Sony and Toyota are both
post-war creations. Our philosophy, as a company with pre-war origins, is
very different,' says Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Mitsubishi Materials and
president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation. 'People work for us all
their lives partly because they know their incomes will rise as they grow
older. But we also have a kind of family atmosphere, special to the mining
industry, which is one of the origins of Japanese industry,' he says. 'It
makes for very stable corporate planning, even if it is not so easy in a
recession,' he says.
The tradition of lifetime employment will change, he accepts. But it will
take a generation - so expect no revolutions.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Railtrack pressed on Scottish line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack, which will run Britain's rail infrastructure from next April, is
to be pressed to electrify a line between Edinburgh and Glasgow to test
government willingness to fund rail projects that do not produce an adequate
rate of return.
A study by consultants Oscar Faber TPA presented yesterday showed that
electrifying the route via Falkirk, the commuter line between the two
cities, was the best option for its future. It would attract passengers from
the roads, the consultants said.
While it would not meet the government's required 8 per cent rate of return
on investment, a good case could be made for seeking a government grant when
social and non-user benefits were taken into account, the study said.
Mr Paul Prescott, director of Railtrack Scotland, said that if the project
were evaluated on the same basis as a road scheme 'it would come out almost
higher than upgrading the M8 motorway' between Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In its rail privatisation white paper last January, the government said it
was 'ready to provide support for investing in the railway for schemes
which, although not earning an adequate financial return, provide a
substantial cost-benefit return when wider benefits are taken into account'.
Electrifying the 47-mile line would cost about Pounds 75m, of which Pounds
50m would be spent on new trains. The 100mph trains would run every 15
minutes instead of the present 30 minutes, and permit a journey time of 44
minutes compared with the present 50 minutes.
The study was commissioned by ScotRail and Strathclyde, Central and Lothian
regional councils, which want to contain road congestion.
ScotRail and the councils will now press the government through Railtrack to
help finance the project.
The initial approach will be to the Scottish Office. Mr Cyril Bleasdale,
director of ScotRail, said a decision was unlikely for two years. 'It's a
vision and a long-term strategy,' he said.
Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of Strathclyde regional council's transport
committee, said it would be 'a test case of the government's new policy'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / BR to sell six repair centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail yesterday put up for sale its six heavy-maintenance workshops,
which employ 3,500 people throughout the country to perform big repairs to
rolling stock.
The workshops, as well as two small electronic service centres, made an
operating surplus of about Pounds 5m on turnover of Pounds 186m in the year
ended last March. Bids are expected from management buy-out teams and large
rolling stock manufacturers such as GEC Alsthom and ABB Transportation.
The workshops, which carry out engine maintenance, collision repairs and
painting contracts, are being sold off as part of the privatisation of BR.
Light repair workshops will be sold to the private train operators which
acquire the rights to run services on the rail network, but it was thought
unlikely that they would be interested in owning the heavy maintenance
activities.
Details of the sale appeared in press advertisements yesterday inviting
organisations interested in acquiring the operations to contact Lazard
Brothers, the merchant bank.
Once BR gauges the strength of the response it will decide details of the
sale and issue formal invitations to bid next March or April. Mr Bill Tyler,
communications director in BR's vendor unit, said it was likely the business
would be split up among more than one bidder. He thought it unlikely there
would be closures in the works network because it was uneconomic to move
rolling stock requiring significant maintenance long distances.
The plants to be sold are at Doncaster, Eastleigh near Southampton,
Springburn in Glasgow, Wolverton near Milton Keynes, Ilford in east London,
and Chart Leacon, near Ashford in Kent. The electronic service centres are
at Swindon and Eastleigh.
The first four heavy maintenance workshops are part of British Rail
Maintenance. The last two are known as Level 5 depots and are part of
British Rail.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Export award goes to textile machine group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bonas Machine Company, a textile machinery manufacturer in north-east
England, last night won the first NatWest/FT Exporter award for export
excellence.
The company beat six other finalists, including Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, the
former ICI drugs business.
Bonas, founded in 1957, is based at Team Valley, Gateshead, and has offices
in Charlotte in the US, Hong Kong, Bombay, Frankfurt and Milan. It makes
electronic jacquards - devices attached to looms that enable figures to be
woven into fabrics.
With 383 employees worldwide, it exports to more than 75 countries, but
particularly to the US, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Italy and India. About
90 per cent of its Pounds 35m annual turnover is exported.
The competition was organised by National Westminster Bank, the Financial
Times and the Institute of Export.
Winners of regional heats were announced at forums in London, Belfast,
Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle during the last eight
weeks.
Unlike most other export awards, neither the size of a company's export
order book nor rapid growth in foreign markets were necessarily
qualifications to win.
'The excellence awards were designed to test exporting philosophy and ethos
in depth, rather than just acknowledge turnover and profit,' said Mr Ian
Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export and chairman of the
judges.
'Bonas demonstrated extensive customer contact, new product introduction,
staff training and an attempt to raise standards year on year.'
Independent assessors from the Institute of Export, NatWest and KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountancy firm, rated the finalists on efficiency,
innovation, training, quality control, and whether exporting was part of
each company's main thrust, rather than a bolt-on function.
This enabled very small companies such as Magstim - which makes medical
instruments in Dyfed, South Wales, and has only a Pounds 1m turnover - to
compete with Zeneca, the north-west winner, and Richardson Sheffield, the
kitchen knife manufacturer with annual sales of more than Pounds 25m.
Valpar Industrial of Bangor, County Down, the Northern Ireland winner, turns
over only Pounds 3m, selling a cooling system for beverages such as lager,
beer or cola, between store-room and tap.
The other two finalists were Apollo Fire Detectors, the Hampshire-based
London regional winner, and Staffordshire Tableware, which claims to be the
world's largest manufacturer of mugs, which won the Midlands prize.
Bonas received its award at a dinner in London last night from Baroness
Chalker, the overseas development minister, Lord Alexander, NatWest
chairman, and Mr David Bell, chief executive of the FT.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Counties review dubbed 'a mess'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to make the Local Government Commission for
England conduct a further review of councils in Derbyshire and County Durham
could itself be open to judicial review, it was said yesterday.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow local government minister, described the review as
a 'mess'. He said: 'The reference back of Durham and Derbyshire and not of
Cleveland appears to be a highly partisan move which could well leave the
secretary of state (Mr John Gummer, environment secretary) open to judicial
review.'
Plans to restructure all three counties were unveiled this month by the
commission. However, the government announced a change to its guidance for
the commission in September, which made it clear that it expected the
two-tier status quo of counties and districts to be replaced by unitary
authorities.
Mr Straw said Cleveland, which is Labour-controlled and is to be split into
four unitary authorities, might have a case for judicial review because it
will not be re-examined by the commission.
Mr Dennis Pettit, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of County
Councils, said the move over Derbyshire and County Durham called the
independence of Sir John's commission into question.
The cross-party Association of District Councils, though, said it signalled
the end for the two-tier status quo.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Recovery uneven in east Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small quoted companies in the east Midlands are trailing large groups in
recovery from recession.
Their turnover was static and both pre-tax profits and dividend payments
declined in 1992-93, according to analysis of the performance of the
region's quoted companies by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants.
The financial plight of companies with a stock market value of less than
Pounds 50m emphasises the uneven progress of recovery in one of the most
economically diversified regions, where only 21 per cent of total sales of
quoted companies are made overseas compared with 38 per cent of west
Midlands companies.
The KPMG analysis shows that while collectively the region's 71 quoted
companies increased their turnover in 1992-93 by 1.9 per cent, turnover of
the small companies fell by 0.5 per cent. Against a regional average of a
6.9 per cent decline, the operating profits of small companies fell by 71.3
per cent.
Although all quoted companies reduced their debt levels, the poor trading
performance of small companies meant profits covered interest payments only
0.5 times, compared with 6.0 times for large companies.
Overall, companies increased dividend payments by a greater proportion than
the rise in attributable earnings. But, said KPMG, 'the 12 per cent
reduction in dividends paid by small companies has offset reduced profits
and increased dividend cover'.

FT  01 DEC 93 / DTI man outlines assumption on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Machine-tool manufacturers would have assumed that their arms-related
shipments to Iraq were being condoned by the government, an export licensing
official admitted yesterday.
Mr Anthony Steadman, director of the Department of Trade and Industry's
export licensing unit from May 1987 to November 1991, said that with
hindsight this would have been the case. Mr Steadman was outlining to the
Scott inquiry the behind-the-scenes preparations for a meeting between
machine-tool companies and Mr Alan Clark, the trade minister in January
1988.
At the meeting, attended among others by Matrix Churchill, the Coventry
machine-tool manufacturer, companies were worried because the government had
frozen their export licences for Iraq before they had completed their
shipments.
Mr Steadman told the hearing that both the DTI and the manufacturers were
aware that the machine tools were going to Iraq for munitions use, but
neither party mentioned it at the meeting.
Mr Steadman, an official with crucial responsibilities in one of the most
important areas of the inquiry, said the nature of the exports was not
raised because of concerns to protect intelligence sources.
Ms Presily Baxendale, counsel for the inquiry, said: 'Everyone at the
meeting has at the back of their mind the knowledge that the DTI's concern
is about the equipment being used for munitions.'
Mr Steadman agreed, but denied there was anything strange about the fact
that it was not mentioned. 'We didn't want to be specific,' he said.
He added: 'I think we didn't want to disclose the extent of what we know.'
Mr Steadman said the manufacturers would have known of the DTI's concerns.
Asked by Lord Justice Scott whether he thought it would have been a 'natural
assumption' for the manufacturers to believe that the DTI did not mind about
the exports, Mr Steadman said: 'In hindsight, perhaps yes.'
Discussion at the meeting was a central issue in the trial last year of
three Matrix Churchill executives accused of illegally exporting machine
tools to Iraq. The case collapsed after Mr Clark admitted he had been
economical with the 'actualite' in his approach to the manufacturers.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Bush at palace for knighthood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Former US President George Bush was yesterday awarded an honorary knighthood
by the Queen. The announcement came as Mr Bush and his wife were attending a
lunch at Buckingham Palace.
Mr Bush, in Britain on a private visit, was honoured with the Knight Grand
Cross of the Order of the Bath - a rare award also bestowed on his
predecessor Ronald Reagan.
Like all foreigners, he will be barred from adopting the title 'Sir' but is
able to wear the insignia and use the initials GCB after his name.
The award, at the recommendation of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
marks the government's close relationship with the Bush administration,
particularly during the Gulf war in 1991.
The Foreign Office said the award was made with the full approval of US
President Bill Clinton.
A spokesman added: 'It is unusual, but not unprecedented, for the Queen to
present the honorary award herself. President Reagan was another who
received his in person.'
The two presidents are among the few Americans to have received the award
since the end of the second world war, when six US military commanders were
honoured.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Five countries query legality of Thorp permit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has received inquiries from the European Commission and other
European governments about the legality of licensing the Thorp nuclear
reprocessing plant in Cumbria, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, told the Commons in a written answer that,
since the start of the second public consultation on Thorp in August, the
government had received letters from the Irish Republic and Denmark about
the application of the European directive on environmental impact
assessments to Thorp.
He added that Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands had also written to the UK
about Thorp and the environmental impact assessments required under
international marine pollution recommendations. Ministers are expected to
announce within days whether they will give the go-ahead to the Pounds 2.8bn
plant. They have already said that they are 'minded' to grant a licence.
British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, has said that the alternative of
launching a public inquiry could delay start of operation by months and
would undermine its profitability.
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said yesterday: 'It
would be nonsense for the government to give the plant the nod only for the
European Court to rule it illegal later.'
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which has mounted court
challenges to the government's handling of the Thorp decision, said
yesterday it believed that full environmental impact assessments should be
carried out before a decision was made.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Company VAT registrations fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of companies registered for value added tax dropped last year for
the first time in more than a decade, figures from the Department of Trade
and Industry showed yesterday.
There was net decline of 41,000 businesses, or 2.5 per cent of the stock
last year, following annual average increases of 36,000 each year since
1979.
The figures are based on VAT registration information collected by Customs
and Excise Of 1.6m businesses registered at the start of last year, there
were 189,000 registrations and 230,000 de-registrations.
The number of businesses declined in all regions except Northern Ireland.
The largest falls were in south-east and south-west England.
The largest decline was in construction, which showed a net de-registration
of 20.9 per cent. Retail fell by 8.2 per cent, and production by 4.1 per
cent. There were also declines in catering, transport, motor trades and
agriculture.
The largest increase was just 1.1 per cent for finance, property and
professional services and 1.1 per cent for other businesses.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Potato quotas to cease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 60-year-old potato marketing scheme, which attempts to match supply and
demand by setting quotas for producers, is to be abolished in 1997, Mrs
Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, announced yesterday.
The move will conclude the de-regulation of agricultural commodity marketing
in the UK. The Milk Marketing Board, the compulsory purchasing scheme, is
due to be replaced by a voluntary producers' co-operative next April.
Mrs Shephard's decision on potatoes is in line with European Commission
policy to encourage greater competition in agricultural commodity markets.
'We are convinced this will be the best way of attacking the large and
increasing trade gap in processed potatoes, by giving our producers the
opportunity to be more responsive to market forces,' Mrs Shephard told the
Potato Marketing Board's annual lunch.
She said she was adopting proposals by the board and the National Farmers'
Union to ease the country's 16,000 registered potato growers through the
three-year transition towards a free market.
Farmers, who earn a total of Pounds 500m a year from the UK potato crop,
feared that an overnight switch to open competition would destabilise
prices. They were worried that price volatility would cut consumption.
Mr David Naish, NFU president, welcomed the three-year 'breathing space' and
said this would give the union a chance to campaign for a strong regulatory
framework to continue beyond 1997.
The potato marketing scheme will continue in modified form until the end of
1996-97, and the government will review the position before consulting the
industry on final abolition.
During the transition, Mrs Shephard proposed that the quota system be made
more flexible, to free the market, allowing producers to grow 5 per cent
more or fewer potatoes than their limit without facing penalties.
Intervention buying of potatoes by the board, funded by producers, will end.
Until now, the board has been obliged to buy surplus potatoes, which it
sells at a loss as animal feed.
About 1,300 growers will be exempted from the need to register in order to
reduce regulation and paperwork.

Swindon, Bristol and Gloucester yesterday launched a joint initiative to
address the economic issues facing their region.
A declaration supporting the so-called West of England Initiative was signed
by councillors from Thamesdown, the borough council for Swindon, and the two
cities. Backing is also expected from Bath City Council. The initiative is
intended to work with the Western Development Partnership, an agency set up
to provide a regional forum, and with businesses, local authorities,
Training and Enterprise Councils and higher education.
It reflects growing awareness in the west of England that more regional
co-operation on strategic issues is needed.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Court orders surrender of riot film
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A court yesterday ordered news organisations to hand over film and
photographs taken during a violent anti-Nazi demonstration in Welling,
south-east London, last month.
Judge Gerald Butler QC ruled at Southwark Crown Court that the public
interest in seeing the capture of those responsible for rioting on October
16 which left 200 police and 50 other people injured 'far outweighed' the
real possibility of an increased risk to photographers as a result of his
decision.
The order, sought by the Metropolitan Police, applies to the Press
Association news agency, the BBC, Independent Television News, British Sky
Broadcasting, London News Network, and The Guardian, The Observer, The
Sunday Times, the People and the News of the World, which all opposed the
applica-tion.
The judge said that when trouble broke out during the protest, which
attracted up to 16,000 demonstrators, police officers were attacked with a
hail of missiles.
The judge said that he accepted the police contention that, although they
had photographs and video film of the violence, this presented an incomplete
picture. The material held by various media organisations was far more
extensive and was necessary to identify the culprits.
He said most of those opposing the application, including the Press
Association, had contended that courts should be slow to take any step which
would restrict full and fair news reporting.
Among the arguments barrister Mr Manuel Barca had put forward on their
behalf was that the police application would lead to an 'actual or perceived
loss of impartiality and an increased danger to photographers'.
No order was made regarding costs.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Asia comes to terms with growing threat from Aids: The
disease came late to the continent but governments no longer sweep it under
the carpet as a 'foreign' problem

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday established a new 'Association for Preventing Sexually
Transmitted Diseases and Aids' at a ceremony held in the Great Hall of the
People. It was a measure of China's, arguably belated, recognition of the
threat posed by Aids in the world's most populous country that the Great
Hall itself was given over to such a meeting on the eve of World Aids Day.
The Chinese bureaucracy appears to have begun to take the problem seriously.
It has started to devote more resources to public education, and officials
are now talking more openly about the issue. The shift echoes a rethink
taking place across Asia as governments in the region, which previously
preferred to sweep Aids under the carpet as a 'foreign' problem, come to
terms with the threat the disease poses to their populations - in
particular, to the economically active portion.
In India, where nearly seven in every thousand are testing positive to the
HIV virus which is believed to lead to Aids, 83 per cent are below the age
of 50 years, and more than two-thirds of those affected are between 20 and
40. Authorities in Thailand, the Asian epicentre, estimate that between 400
and 600 of its people are infected every day.
Attention paid to the issue is likely to increase ahead of the 1994
international annual conference on Aids, which is being held in the region
for the first time. According to Prof Yuichi Shiokawa, chairman of the
organising committee for the conference, in Yokohama next August, 'Asia
faces the possibility of an explosive increase in Aids from now to the end
of the century'.
The disease came fairly late to the continent - Japan registered its initial
case in 1985, the same year that the first annual conference was convened in
the west. This has given rise to hopes that, with preventive education, its
prevalence in the region may plateau at a lower level than elsewhere. But
economic considerations and cultural obstacles in many places still combine
to assist its proliferation.
As Asia is more urbanised than Africa, its cities provide the conditions for
even more rapid transmission. India's Directorate of Health Services has
projected that Bombay already has 120,000 citizens infected.
Mr Neil McKenna, the editor of WorldAids, a newsletter produced by the Panos
Institute, a development organisation, says: 'HIV is accelerating very
rapidly, as fast as it was in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1980s . . . India's
great cities are a potential time-bomb.'
Labour migration is a factor. Indian truck drivers show a higher than
average exposure to the virus. According to Mr Zeng Yi, president of the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the main channels for HIV into China
are through Thailand and Burma.
The incidence of HIV-related infections, it is suggested, is particularly
high among Malaysia's large immigrant workforce. Malaysia is the world's
largest producer of condoms - but usage is still very low. With its high
rate of literacy and generally well organised medical services, the country
is in a good position to combat Aids. But government efforts to launch
nationwide campaigns and sex education programmes have been opposed by
conservative Moslem groups.
The Thai government gives away 80m condoms a year which can be obtained free
in many brothels. The use of condoms appears to have increased following a
modest decline in sexually transmitted diseases. However, Thai health care
workers say many customers still do not use them.
Conditions in Asia assist HIV's other common means of transmission as well.
In China, the fairly common practice of using one syringe for dozens of
people in impoverished country regions is blamed for the spread of the virus
in remote areas. Intravenous drug use in southern Yunnan province, which
adjoins the 'Golden Triangle' of Burma, Thailand and Laos, is believed to
have left thousands infected. While blood transfusions in Thailand are now
considered safe, the Indian government has by no means been able to clean up
its contaminated blood supplies. With the main source of blood being paid
donors, and demand far outstripping supply, it is virtually impossible for
the government to screen blood supply.
The developed countries of the region no longer have such problems. But even
in Japan, health care for Aids patients remains a low priority. The Health
and Welfare Ministry is currently telling regional governments to create
Aids facilities in at least two hospitals within a prefecture. But even in
Tokyo, only eight hospitals treat people with Aids, with just three
accepting in-patients.
In Australia the incidence of Aids cases per 100,000 population is about 18,
putting it in the top third of OECD countries (though the US has almost 86
per 100,000). Australia was probably fortunate in having a strong gay rights
movement, which built on experience in the US and disseminated HIV/Aids
information quickly when the infection surfaced. Early projections there
have proved overly pessimistic.
China, in coming to terms with the problem, still has official statistics
maintaining that only 19 people have developed Aids, 14 of whom have died.
But Mr Wan Yanhai, who has established Aids hotlines in several Chinese
cities, believes that numbers infected exceed 100,000.
The country has begun working more closely with international agencies. In
September, it drew up a draft programme with WHO. Mr Zeng of the preventive
medicine academy will attend the Yokohama conference - an indication that
China is becoming more willing to participate in global solutions to health
problems.

<TEXT>
New Zealand's Labour MPs early today overwhelmingly elected Ms Helen Clark
as their party's new leader, ending a gruelling battle to oust Mr Mike Moore
who had led Labour to two electoral defeats.
Ms Clark, a former university lecturer, is from the left wing of the party.
She has indicated that she wants to turn Labour back to its socialist roots
and has spoken of the need to raise taxes to help the under-privileged.
The party caucus, in an apparent bid to retain the support of Mr Moore's
supporters, who back the right-wing reforms of recent years, voted to
appoint Mr David Caygill as deputy leader. Mr Caygill, although a Clark
supporter, is considered a right-winger and was minister of finance in 1988
and 1989 after the sacking of reformist Sir Roger Douglas.
Ms Clark is the first woman to lead a major New Zealand political party. She
won the caucus vote by 26 to 19, attracting much bigger support than had
been expected.

FT  01 DEC 93 / HK telephone monopoly to end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government said yesterday that three companies would be
licensed to compete with Hongkong Telecom, the colony's telephone monopoly,
in the provision of local telephone services when the monopoly's exclusive
licence expires in 1995.
Government officials hailed the decision as an important stage in the
implementation of its pro-competition telecoms policy.
After a lengthy review the government decided last year to permit
competition in the local market. Hongkong Telecom retains its monopoly on
international telephony, which generates most of its profits, until 2006.
Mr Gordon Siu, secretary for economic services, said the advent of
competition would enhance Hong Kong's position as a financial and business
centre in Asia and bring substantial benefits to business and residential
telecoms users in the colony.
The award of the licences is, however, subject to the approval of the
Chinese government. Under the terms of Hong Kong's transfer to China in
1997, matters which straddle that year first have to be agreed with Beijing.
It is not expected that China will raise any objection to the three groups
selected to operate competitive services against Hongkong Telecom. The three
large conglomerates - Hutchison Whampoa, Wharf and New World - all have
close links with the Chinese leadership.
The companies plan to compete with Hongkong Telecom in the provision of
niche services for consumers and businesses, mostly video, computer and data
services. Wharf, which also operates a cable television network, will have
the greatest access to the household market of the three.
Analysts said that the advent of competition would not pose a serious threat
to Hongkong Telecom's revenues. Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst with
Salomon Brothers, said the new entrants would keep the monopoly on its toes,
in terms of the provision of service to customers, and in the future bring
to the market services which are today only embryonic.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Britain may sell Thai embassy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The UK Foreign Office is considering the sale or lease of its extensive
embassy grounds in central Bangkok, which could raise up to Dollars 200m
(Pounds 134m), according to diplomats and estate agents.
Britain bought the five-hectare site in 1921, moving its mission away from
the noisy Chao Phraya river to what was then a quiet, leafy suburb. But the
embassy now fronts on to Ploenchit Road, one of the Thai capital's busiest
thoroughfares and a prime real estate location.
The chief clerk in charge of Foreign Office administration visited Bangkok
recently to assess the possibilities. One option is to lease only part of
the property and keep the rest.
Diplomats say the Foreign Office wants to raise money to finance
construction of new missions in eastern Europe.
'We are looking at all options to make the best use of the British embassy's
estate in Bangkok,' said Mr Anthony Wilson, embassy spokesman. 'But no
definite decision has been taken.' The cabinet is expected to have the final
word.
Disposing of the property may be controversial. The embassy grounds are one
of the few areas of greenery in the Thai capital and every year the
'Ploenchit Fair' is held there to raise money for Thai charities; this
quintessentially British affair of stalls, raffles and beer-drinking has
proved remarkably popular among Thai families living in Bangkok.
'It's a common trend for embassies to sell up,' said Mr Paul Scales,
managing director of Jones Lang Wootton in Bangkok. 'It's a super site and
if it were tastefully developed it could be a landmark site.'
Some British diplomats believe it could be foolish to sell the property
outright. They recall the sale of a consulate building in the booming
northern town of Chiang Mai which was sold for some Dollars 400,000 and
resold by the buyer shortly afterwards for 10 times as much.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Australia switches budget to May

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian federal government will no longer deliver its annual budget
in August, switching to May instead. The move, strongly advocated by Mr John
Dawkins, the treasurer, was approved yesterday by the cabinet.
In arguing for the change, the treasurer claimed that a spring budget would
make it easier for the government to be in step with Australia's financial
year.
He also hopes to avoid a repeat of this year's budget fiasco, when the
government's finance measures were stalled in the Senate for two months, as
minority parties - which hold the balance of power there - haggled over
measures.
The treasurer gave cabinet written assurances from the two minority parties
that they back his timetable for dealing with budget matters by June 30. He
added that the government would 'engage in a more consultative process in
the lead-up to the budget'.
The next budget will be on May 10.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea threatened yesterday to withdraw from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty unless the US conducts a new round of talks with
Pyongyang.
The North suspended its threat to pull out of the treaty in July after
holding two rounds of negotiations with Washington on a possible improvement
in relations.
But the US has said a third session will not occur until Pyongyang agrees to
accept routine international inspections of its nuclear facilities and
agrees to resume inter-Korean talks.
North Korea appears to want unilateral talks with the US, without involving
South Korea, in an attempt to win diplomatic recognition and economic aid
from Washington.
South Korean officials accuse Pyongyang of trying to break co-operation
between Washington and Seoul on the nuclear issue by holding separate talks
with Washington.
The statement by the North Korean foreign ministry appeared to be a response
to the declaration issued by the presidents of the US and South Korea in
Washington last week that Pyongyang first had to accept nuclear inspections
and inter-Korean talks before contacts with the US would be resumed.
'We want a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue. But if
the US. . . ends the dialogue, there would be no reason for us to stop our
decision to withdraw from the NPT from taking effect,' the North said.
It also said it was prepared to withstand economic sanctions and other
consequences if the current negotiations to resolve the nuclear issue
collapsed.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Output fall adds to fears on economy: Figures on Japan's
manufacturing, employment and business gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's industrial output fell 5.1 per cent in October, the largest
month-on-month decline on record.
In part, the slide reflected the fall-off from a sharp increase in September
as companies tried to boost output before the end of their half-year
accounting period.
But it was only one of several figures published yesterday which added to
doubts about the country's economic recovery.
Deteriorating conditions of the labour market were highlighted in a 2.7 per
cent rise in unemployment in October, a six-year high. The ratio of job
offers to job seekers fell to a six-year low of 0.67, that is, 67 jobs for
100 seekers.
A quarterly survey of business conditions by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry indicated that 65 per cent of more than 160 leading
Japanese companies did not expect a business recovery until late 1994 or
later. Only 15 per cent forecast a recovery in conditions in the next six
months.
The Nikkei 225 average, which plunged to a year's low Monday, recovered
327.83 points, or 2 per cent, to 16,406.54 after government officials and
financial authorities yesterday pledged to implement measures to boost the
economy.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, said the central bank was ready to
take additional monetary action if the underlying economic conditions
warranted.
Ms Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, called
for income tax cuts and an expansionary budget for the next business year to
support consumer spending, while Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, and Mr
Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, said the
government would consider easing land taxes and action to reinvigorate the
property market.
The worsening economic outlook came as parliament began debate on the
supplementary budget announced in September.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, may be forced to extend the
parliamentary session as approval of the budget is likely to take about a
week, blocking discussion of his political reform package in the upper house
of the Diet until December 8.
Mr Hosokawa has pledged to introduce political reform bills before December
15.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Council to back Patten over democracy bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong governor Chris Patten yesterday won the support of his Executive
Council, or colonial cabinet, to push ahead with the first stage of his
democracy legislation.
The council voted 10 to 1 in favour of introducing a bill into the
Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's 60-strong law-making body, early
next month.
China has warned that if the bill is tabled in LegCo, further talks about
Hong Kong's political development can not take place.
China has accused the British of scuppering a potential deal because they
brought up extraneous issues, a charge vigorously denied by London.
But Beijing has sought to reassure Hong Kong that in the absence of a deal
it will do its best to preserve the colony's prosperity and stability.
The two sides got close to agreeing a first-stage deal when talks broke down
at the weekend.
The possibility remains that an agreement might be clinched before Mr Patten
presents his bill.
The bill contains provisions to lower Hong Kong's voting age to 18 from 21
years, abolish appointments to local government, and provide for 20
single-seat, single-vote constituencies for LegCo elections due in 1995.
The more controversial aspects of Mr Patten's plans, which cover voting
arrangements for 40 of LegCo's seats, will be left to another bill.
It is expected that this will be introduced sometime in the new year.
The Executive Council's decision was communicated yesterday to Mr Douglas
Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary. He is expected to endorse the decision.
The bill will be put to LegCo on either December 8 or December 15.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Hopes run high for tariff-cutting deal: Uruguay Round
countries are pressing the US and EU for an accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An air of expectancy hangs in Brussels this morning as Sir Leon Brittan, the
EU trade commissioner, meets Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, for the
ninth time in as many months: after almost 10 months of cat and mouse, a
mood of 'exceptional sensitivity' suggests the US and the European Union are
poised to settle a tariff-cutting deal that could open the way to successful
completion of the Uruguay Round of global trade reform.
Both are aware of the mounting pressure from the other 114 participants in
the Uruguay Round for them to settle differences.
This comes not just from a 'hard' deadline of December 15 to complete the
deal, but also from recognition that liberalisation will help to haul
economies out of recession, create new jobs, and over the next decade boost
world trade by at least Dollars 270bn (Pounds 180bn).
In Geneva last Friday, Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, warned that the US and EU 'must at their
meeting in Brussels reach a substantive result and place a decisive
contribution on the table'.
Such is the importance of the US and the EU in world trade that other
countries can only make their own final market-opening offers when they have
seen the shape and substance of a US-EU package.
Optimism over today's talks has various roots: a virtual frenzy of
preparation; the uncharacteristically tight-lipped mood of negotiators; the
headway made in recent weeks, which has narrowed disagreements to a small
number of issues.
Talks begin early today, continue through a working lunch, and are expected
to continue late into tonight. They will resume tomorrow, prospectively
feeding straight into the special EU council meeting tomorrow evening.
On the US side, Mr Kantor will be joined by Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, and perhaps also Mr Larry Summers, deputy treasury
secretary, who is currently in Moscow.
Sir Leon will be joined by a number of other EU commissioners, as well as
top negotiators in services, procurement, anti-dumping and audio-visual
services.
All of these issues will be addressed, but the core of the talks - and the
details most urgently awaited by negotiators in Geneva - will be market
access in manufactured goods.
The issues in hand are as follows:
US tariff peaks, in particular those on textile goods, ceramics, and glass.
Details of a deal on ceramics and glass products might be unveiled by the
end of tomorrow, but the general feeling is that even if a textiles deal is
agreed, it is unlikely to be unveiled publicly until the last minute, in
order to minimise the exposure of the US administration to pressure from
powerful local lobbies.
EU tariffs on electronics (particularly semi-conductors), non-ferrous metals
and wood and paper products. The US wants these cut to zero. They are
important not just to the US, but to other Uruguay Round negotiators:
south-east Asian governments see better access for their semi-conductor
manufacturers as the key to their being able to improve offers to liberalise
their financial services markets. Canada and Australia want better access
for aluminium and copper exporters as a quid pro quo for fresh movement in
the farm trade area. Deals could be made public here.
EU tariff cuts on farm products, and the gradual replacement of import
quotas with tariffs which would be reduced over time, are regarded as
important not just by the US, but also by the Cairns group of 14 farm
exporters. The EU has been resisting pressure to reduce protection for pork
and barley, but may be poised to give ground if the US is willing to bow to
European pressure to tweak the Blair House accord dictating cuts in
subsidised EU farm exports.
Such is the sensitivity of farm trade that a deal may be carefully veiled
until close to December 15.
As a measure of the urgency facing negotiators, Sir Leon will walk virtually
directly from the negotiating room to the EU council meeting to report - and
presumably seek approval - from EU foreign and trade ministers.
Details will be relayed directly to Geneva, where bilateral negotiations
will begin immediately with other countries on tariff-cutting pledges.
That will leave for next week - the final full week of negotiation - the
task of settling disputes on financial services, even-handed tax treatment,
anti-dumping laws, audio-visual services, maritime services, and subsidies
in sectors such as steel and aircraft.
Even with success in Brussels, celebration over a Uruguay Round deal would
still be premature.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Treuhand in barter deal with Russians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency and a banking consortium led by Dresdner
Bank yesterday secured contracts worth DM800m (Pounds 315m) as part of a
barter deal between eastern German manufacturers and authorities in Perm,
Russia.
More than 40 Treuhand-run east German enterprises will export construction
and mining equipment and machine tools to industries in Perm. The goods will
be partly financed by chemicals, raw materials and timber products from the
region.
The barter contract, part of which will also be backed by Hermes, Germany's
export credit guarantee agency, is an attempt by the Treuhand to save the
remaining manufacturing base of eastern Germany through rebuilding markets
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. These markets collapsed after
German unification and the demise of Comecon, the socialist countries'
trading bloc.
This contract is the second this month. The Treuhand and Deutsche Bank
arranged a DM1bn barter and financing package for the export of east German
manufactured goods to the Tyumen region of Russia. The latest contract
signals a cautious return to Russia by Hermes, which last August said it
would not be extending guarantees for 1994.
The first deliveries, signed for yesterday by Mr Hans Georg Pohl, a Treuhand
official, and Mr Gennadij Igumnow, responsible for Perm's industrial
development, will start early in the new year.

FT  01 DEC 93 / US and EU push for Gatt breakthrough: Brittan prepared to
work through the night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and European Union will today attempt a breakthrough in the Gatt
world trade talks, amid fresh signs that France is prepared to soften its
hardline stance toward a deal.
Senior officials in Brussels said that Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief
trade negotiator, remained ready to negotiate 'through the night' with Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, with the aim of producing a draft
accord within the next 48 hours.
The Brittan-Kantor talks in Brussels are widely viewed as the last chance
for the Europeans and Americans to resolve their differences in time for the
December 15 deadline for a comprehensive deal among the more than one
hundred governments that are party to the talks.
Amid a flurry of last-minute diplomacy, Sir Leon has made clear that the EU
will not accept a deal unless the US meets specific demands covering
agriculture, the audiovisual sector, and the aeronautics industry - a
reference to US objections to European subsidies for Airbus Industrie.
As a result, Mr Eduard Balladur, prime minister, this week shelved earlier
threats to veto a deal and signalled he was ready to sign an agreement, if
'French national interests are protected'.
The more flexible line from Paris also follows high-level warnings from
Germany and the UK that failure to reach a Gatt agreement would jeopardise
prospects for an economic recovery in Europe and risk splitting the European
Union.
Brussels officials said Sir Leon intended to push for a comprehensive draft
accord with Mr Kantor, in order to submit the outline agreement to a special
meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow. This would allow EU
governments and parliaments to have a chance to assess the deal before it
could be initialled on December 15.
The Kantor-Brittan talks will cover a broad market access package for goods
and services, the creation of a Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) to
resolve trade disputes, and a new steel industry regime.
Separately, Mr Rene Steichen, European Commissioner responsible for
agriculture, will meet Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, to discuss
possible 'clarifications' to the November 1992 EU-US Blair House accord
which limits farm export subsidies.
France has threatened to veto a Gatt deal unless it obtains alterations to
the Blair House accord, possibly through more flexible treatment of food
stocks and a reordering of the timetable for reductions in cereal export
subsidies. Sir Leon Brittan hinted last week that the Clinton administration
might agree to changes in Blair House.
Trade experts in Brussels said yesterday that France could also be mollified
if it could exclude the sensitive audiovisual sector from a Gatt deal and
obtain assurances that the US intends to curbing unilateral action in trade
disputes. This could be achieved either through a strong MTO or through new
measures beefing up the EU's anti-dumping procedures.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Results of reforms to CAP 'near forecasts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday said that the results of the first year of
the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy came in close to forecasts, and
should therefore make it easier to conclude a farm trade deal with the US in
the closing stages of the Uruguay Round.
As EU and US trade negotiators meet to try to break the deadlock in the
world trade talks in Brussels today and tomorrow, the CAP results will be
scanned carefully by France and its allies, who claim cuts in subsidised
food exports offered within Gatt exceed what CAP reform can deliver.
Mr Rene Steichen, EU farm commissioner, said provisional figures for the
1993 growing season showed total cereals output falling to 164.7m tonnes,
against CAP reform projections of 166m tonnes. The amount of land taken out
of production was exactly as forecast, at 4.7m hectares. He said these
figures 'clearly indicate that CAP reform is achieving its most important
objective, ie, reducing production,' confirming to Europe's trading partners
that the 12 have put in place an effective system to reduce oversupply and
consequent dumping on world markets.
The 1993 total compares with output of 168m tonnes in 1992, and 180.7m
tonnes in 1991. The relatively small drop on last year is seen by some
critics of the reform as evidence of its feebleness, and by others as proof
that much more land will have to be taken out of production to meet the Gatt
cuts, of 21 per cent of subsidised exports over six years.

FT  01 DEC 93 / France and Britain in EU airlines rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France said yesterday it had won majority support in the European Union for
its efforts to blunt airline deregulation in order to bail out financially
stricken flag carriers. But others at the Brussels meeting of transport
ministers disputed the claim.
Although France said nine of the 12 backed its proposals, four European
Union member states - the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark - took
the rare step of dissociating themselves from the conclusions to the debate
on the future of civil aviation published by the Belgian presidency of the
EU.
The 12 agreed to try to repair the growing EU rift over the airline crisis
at a special meeting in Athens on February 7, by when the 'committee of wise
men' set up by the European Commission to examine the industry will have
reported.
Transport ministers will then try to agree a policy when they meet in April.
France came to yesterday's meeting seeking a relaxation of EU rules which
prevent airlines from sharing capacity, a freeze on air traffic fees, and EU
funding to speed up the pace at which older aircraft are taken out of
service. The UK led the opposition, calling for a ban on state aid to flag
carriers, and arguing against any retreat from Europe's 'open skies' regime.
By lunchtime Mr Bernard Bosson, France's transport minister, declared that
Britain was 'absolutely isolated'. He said that for France 'there is no
question of turning back' on liberalisation. But if Europe wanted to retain
an airline industry, it could not jump 'from protectionism into a jungle of
ultra-liberalism'.
Mr Bosson claimed that Germany had swelled its 9-3 majority against Britain.
Bonn, he said, backed French calls for implementation of safeguard clauses
on overplied routes; accepted the idea of funding to withdraw old aircraft,
but on environmental grounds; and sought 'moderation' rather than a freeze
on air traffic fees.
His statement was strongly denied by a senior German official, who said: 'We
are much closer to the British than the French on this.' He confirmed
Germany had refused to endorse the Belgian presidency document, which raised
the prospect of EU funding and invited member states to invoke safeguard
clauses on capacity-sharing.
The clauses admit the possibility of airlines clubbing together to reduce
flights and share out passengers if all carriers on a particular route are
losing money.
One UK official said the French 'were at a different meeting'.

Two former Christian Democrat prime ministers of Italy knew about the

times also occupied by both men - has been said to have had direct knowledge
of illicit financing.
Mr Citaristi has received 64 separate notices of investigation from 12
different sets of magistrates for corruption and illicit financing. He has
not denied the charges but refused to accept political responsibility.
Yesterday he gave evidence in the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a consultant
close to the Socialist party who is alleged to have handled part of the
L150bn (Pounds 60m) bribe paid by Ferruzzi-Montedison to arrange the
reorganisation of the petrochemicals industry - the so-called Enimont
affair.
Mr Citaristi said his party needed up to L65bn in a normal year and L90bn in
an election year, of which half came illicitly. He said De Mita, then party
leader, told him to contact Mr Raul Gardini, then head of
Ferruzzi-Montedison, to obtain a contribution. Mr Gardini handed over L2bn.
Between 1988 and 1992 a further L7bn was paid.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Strike call adds to Italy unrest

<TEXT>
Italy's engineering unions have called out 400,000 workers for a one-day
strike on December 10 in protest at growing unemployment.
The strike call comes as Fiat said it would cut its workforce by 5 per cent
and Olivetti, the computers and office equipment group, said it wanted a
further 2,000 job cuts among its 18,500 Italian workers.
The move underlines growing labour unrest. Last night petrol pump operators
began a three-day strike; and throughout the rest of the week stoppages have
been threatened by various groups of employees in air transport.
Unemployment, now close to 11 per cent of the working population, has
particularly hit the engineering and metal-working sectors. The unions say
the recession is so severe that the Ciampi government must consider
reducingthe 48-hour working week and resort to 'solidarity contracts' - a
formula which permits work-sharing arrangements and temporary reductions in
working hours.
The unions are anxious to instil in both the government and among
Confindustria, the industrialists' association, a more strategic view of
industry. The issue of excess labour, they say, must be considered within
the broader context of Italy's industrial policy and priorities. The
employers, they claim, are too concerned with the mechanics of job cuts and
plant closures.

<TEXT>
Greece's Socialist government yesterday presented a budget that attempts to
curtail government spending in order to restrain a fast-growing public
sector deficit.
Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, economy minister, said preparing next year's budget
had been 'a nightmare' because of a revenue shortfall that raised the
government's borrowing requirement this year to 13.9 per cent of gross
domestic product, against a target of 7.9 per cent.
Although the budget projects a primary surplus, the borrowing requirement
will drop only to 12.9 per cent of GDP as a result of high repayments due
next year on domestic debt.
Overall spending is forecast to rise by 9.3 per cent.

<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas has reshuffled his cabinet in the wake of the
nomination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio as his party's presidential candidate
for next year. Mr Manuel Camacho, the powerful mayor of Mexico City and
rival to Mr Colosio, was appointed minister of foreign relations, a post
that takes him away from the centre of the political stage in the run-up to
the election.
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, who resigned as education minister to become Mr
Colosio's campaign manager, was replaced by the foreign relations minister,
Mr Fernando Solana. Mr Zedillo, a former budget minister and central bank
official, in effect, becomes Mr Colosio's closest aide. His presence may
reassure investors concerned about Mr Colosio's experience in economic
policy.
Mexico's ruling party has claimed victory in the gubernatorial election in
the state of Yucatan, although official results are not expected until
today. The centre-right opposition has accused the party of fraud, and is
preparing to protest against alleged vote-rigging in rural parts of the
state.

FT  01 DEC 93 / French unemployment hits 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French unemployment increased sharply in October, rising to 12 per cent of
the workforce from 11.8 per cent at the end of September, higher than most
economists expected. The number of unemployed rose by 40,300 to 3.28m, the
labour ministry announced yesterday.
The figure represents a blow to the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, which
has committed itself to curbing unemployment. It raised fears that the
number of unemployed will continue to rise steadily through the first few
months of next year.
The statistics for October revealed a significant increase in the rate of
youth unemployment. The number of jobless men under the age of 25 rose by
2.9 per cent between the end of September and the end of October, compared
with an average increase of 1.2 per cent in the number seeking work.
A spokesman for the economy ministry said that the government had taken
several steps to limit the rise in joblessness, including an increase in
funding for training schemes and apprenticeships and support for more
flexible employment patterns.
He said that the French economy was showing some encouraging signs,
including a strong rise in consumer spending in the third quarter of the
year and improved confidence among industrialists this month, according to a
survey released on Monday by Insee, the national statistics office.
Private sector economists said that the French economy had shown some
improvement since the sharp downturn in activity at the end of last year.
'The economy appears to have stabilised,' said Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at
Morgan Guaranty in Paris. 'But unemployment is a lagging indicator and is
likely to keep rising, if at a slower rate,' he said.
Bond prices strengthened slightly and the French franc slipped against the
D-Mark as some traders predicted an increase in pressure for interest rate
cuts to stimulate the economy. But several economists warned against hopes
of a rapid reduction in borrowing costs. 'Rate cuts are still decided in
Germany,' said Mr O'Brien, referring to the French strategy of following
German interest rates lower.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decline in west German inflation will be slowed next year by
rising charges for local government services and indirect taxation, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, warned last night. The central bank would
guard against a more general increase in prices, he told economists in
Zurich.
However, he indicated that the central bank believed the monetary situation
was stabilising. Money supply growth had been following a 'more normal'
route for several months, he said, and had moved 'strongly' towards the
upper end of its target range since the summer.
The prospects for prices were brightening. The November cost of living index
had shown a year-on-year increase of 3.7 per cent, and in the last three
months consumer prices had risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
around 2.5 per cent, he said.
He said that the central bank had started reducing interest rates last
autumn when, although money supply was far above target, prospects for
inflation were improving. Mr Tietmeyer claimed current policy, although
based firmly on the growth of money supply, was flexible and never driven by
parochial considerations. 'We do not try to hold money supply on course,
come hell or high water, in the short term,' he said.
His remarks, two days before the Bundesbank central council is due to meet
and consider interest rates, seem likely to encourage expectations of a
reduction in the internationally sensitive 5.75 per cent discount rate.
Industry was cheered by reports of rising foreign demand in the mechanical
engineering and electrical and electronics sectors.
New orders for plant and machinery rose in October for the first time since
March 1992, according to the VDMA industry association. While there was
little sign of recovery in the domestic market, where November engineering
orders were 3 per cent lower than a year earlier, the association said
foreign demand surged a real 17 per cent.
The ZVEI association, representing electrical and electronics companies with
annual sales of DM200bn (Pounds 79bn), said a strengthening in electrical
exports had consolidated in the third quarter.

Italy's engineering unions have called out 400,000 workers for a one-day
strike on December 10 in protest at growing unemployment.
The strike call comes as Fiat said it would cut its workforce by 5 per cent
and Olivetti, the computers and office equipment group, said it wanted a
further 2,000 job cuts among its 18,500 Italian workers.
The move underlines growing levels of labour unrest in different sectors of
the economy in the run-up to Christmas. Last night petrol pump operators
began a three-day strike; and throughout the rest of the week stoppages have
been threatened by various groups of employees in air transport.
Unemployment, now close to 11 per cent of the working population, has
particularly hit the engineering and metal-working sectors. The unions say
the recession is so severe that the Ciampi government must consider
reducingthe 48-hour working week and resort to 'solidarity contracts' - a
formula which permits work-sharing arrangements and temporary reductions in
working hours.
At the same time the unions are anxious to instil in both the government and
among Confindustria, the industrialists' association, a greater strategic
view of industry. The issue of excess labour, they say, must first be
considered with in the broader context of Italy's industrial policy and
priorities. The employers, they claim, are far too concerned with the
mechanics of job cuts and plant closures.
A tripartite approach to industrial strategy was agreed in the July 23
accord between the government, Confindustria and the unions on pay and
productivity.
However, the unions maintain the July pledges have largely been ignored,
especially regarding investments in research and development.
The engineering unions have traditionally been the most influential in
shaping industrial relations. Next week's strike will cover 250,000 in the
private sector and a further 160,000 in state-run industries. The strike
will extend to Fiat plants which have in recent years tended to ignore such
calls.
The Fiat, in announcing its redundancy and lay-offs plan last week, rejected
the idea of a reduced working week. However, the unions fear the parlous
state of the domestic and international vehicle market will provoke more
redundancies. Fiat this year will be producing 1.2m cars against a capacity
of 2m, which will rise to 2.4m next year.

Overall spending is forecast to rise by 9.3 per cent, one percentage point

and collect tax arrears would suffice to improve income.
But he also announced increased taxes on tobacco and cigarettes.
However, the budget projections will quickly be derailed if the government
goes ahead with plans to rehire 25,000 civil servants dismissed by its
conservative predecessor.

The recent decline in west German inflation will be slowed next year by

Mr Tietmeyer claimed current policy, although based firmly on the growth of

His remarks, two days before the Bundesbank central council is due to meet

reduction in the internationally-sensitive 5.75 per cent discount rate.
Private-sector economists, despite being regularly caught wrong-footed by
council decisions, expect a further reduction either this week or on
December 16, the date of the last Bundesbank meeting this year, at which a
key task will be to set targets for money supply growth in 1994.
Underlying inflation is forecast to ease markedly next year as a result of
real pay cuts across much of industry. Forecasters have been encouraged by
individual deals such as that at Volkswagen where a nominal pay cut of 10
per cent has been accepted.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two former Christian Democrat prime ministers of Italy knew about the
large-scale illicit financing of the party, a Milan court heard yesterday.
Mr Severino Citaristi, party treasurer from 1986 until March this year, made
the accusations against Mr Ciriaco De Mita and Mr Arnaldo Forlani. It is the
first time in a court that a Christian Democrat party leader has been said
to have had direct knowledge of illicit financing.
Mr Citaristi has received 64 separate notices of investigation from 12
different sets of magistrates for corruption and illicit financing - the
most of any single politician in the corruption scandals. He has not denied
the charges but refused to accept political responsibility for his illicit
money-collecting activities.
Yesterday he described his activities when he gave evidence in the trial of
Mr Sergio Cusani, a politically influential consultant close to the
Socialist party who is alleged to have handled part of the L150bn (Pounds
60m) bribe paid by Ferruzzi-Montedison to arrange the reorganisation of the
petrochemicals industry - the so-called Enimont affair.
Mr Citaristi said his party needed up to L65bn in a normal year and L90bn in
an election year, of which half came illicitly. He told the court how Mr De
Mita, then party leader, told him to contact Mr Raul Gardini, then head of
Ferruzzi-Montedison, to obtain a contribution. Mr Gardini handed over L2bn.
Between 1988 and 1992 a further L7bn was paid by the group.
In another development yesterday, the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission
issued an alarming report on the influence of organised crime in the Naples
area. The report specifically identified Mr Antonio Gava, a former Christian
Democrat interior minister and now a senator, as being a key link figure
with the Camorra, the Naples mafia.
Mr Gava, already under investigation for such links, is said to have
organised an influence-sharing deal with crime bosses in the distribution of
L50,000bn funds for the 1982 Irpinia earthquake as part of a ransom for Mr
Cirio Cirillo, a powerful local politician.
The report also detailed the power of the Camorra's 111 clans and 6,700
members. It said 32 municipal councils in the Naples area had been dissolved
for links with organised crime (against 19 in all Sicily), 16 out of 31
magistrates were under criminal investigation; while eight members of
parliament risked prosecution for links with the Camorra.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine came under concentrated US and Russian pressure yesterday to
eliminate its nuclear arms and implement in full the US-Soviet Start 1
strategic arms agreement.
The pressure grew as foreign ministers from the 52-nation Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) reviewed contentious security
issues at their Rome summit meeting.
In a speech laced with warnings about the dangers inherent in a slide back
to nationalist 'intolerance and xenophobia', Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister, warned that Ukraine's failure to dismantle all strategic
nuclear arms 'threatened the minimum level of security in Europe'.
The Russian attack followed the decision of the Ukrainian parliament last
month to ratify only partial implementation of the Start agreement, applying
to only 42 per cent of the 1,600 nuclear warheads left on Ukrainian soil
after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Mr Kozyrev's attack on Ukraine's nuclear stance was part of a concerted
Russian effort to boost Moscow's credentials as a responsible Eurasian power
which fulfils its international obligations and which is worthy of CSCE
backing for its own peacekeeping operations in the trans-Caucasus and
central Asian regions.
Moscow's attempt to win a CSCE seal of approval for CIS peacekeeping
operations met resistance from the Baltic states and former Warsaw Pact
members such as Poland and Hungary which fear the eventual resurgence of
Russia's imperial instincts.
But in a clear sign that Washington looks more favourably on Moscow's
willingness to assume great power responsibilities than many smaller CSCE
states, President Bill Clinton is said to have telephoned Ukrainian
President Leonid Kravchuk on Monday to convey US concern at Kiev's delaying
tactics over the removal of nuclear weapons.
Mr Kravchuk is reported to have made clear that Ukrainians see the nuclear
issue as a potential economic bargaining chip as much as a military asset
and promised to bring the ratification issue before the new parliament
elected in the new year.
A decision on CSCE policy towards Russian and CIS peacekeeping missions is
unlikely to be taken at this session.
But Mr Douglas Hogg, the UK foreign office minister, suggested that
ministers and officials should work out a set of criteria for such
operations.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Israel and PLO join in bid to halt violence

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli generals last night held an extraordinary meeting with leaders of Mr
Yassir Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO in the occupied Gaza Strip, in an
effort to halt violence threatening the scheduled start of Palestinian
autonomy.
At the same time Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reiterated that autonomy in
Gaza and the Jericho area of the West Bank might be delayed 'one or two
weeks' after the December 13 target date while details were finalised. On a
visit to Rome, he appealed to 'responsible' Palestinian leaders to help end
the spreading violence.
Guerrillas from the Fatah Hawks, a military wing of the PLO, are openly
rebelling against Mr Arafat's commitment to a renunciation of violence. They
are angry at the killing of one of their members by Israeli troops on Sunday
and the arrest of several of their leaders on Monday.
In clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip
yesterday, Palestinians said more than 60 people were wounded. The Israeli
army put the number at 24.
The latest surge in violence is causing deep concern both in Jerusalem and
at PLO headquarters in Tunis.
Last night's meeting broke up with both sides promising to try to calm
tension. But the Israeli generals rejected the Fatah leaders' request for
the immediate release of Fatah Hawks commander Taisir Bardini. They said Mr
Bardini, captured in a shootout with undercover troops on Monday night, was
wanted for murder.
Before approving the meeting, Brig Gen Ehud Barak, Israel's army chief of
staff, took the equally unusual step of publicly apologising for the killing
of Fatah Hawk member Ahmed Abu-Rish in a Gaza refugee camp on Sunday. He
said an Israeli undercover unit had come under fire and had returned fire,
but had not intended to hit Abu-Rish.
The deputy commander of Israel's forces in Gaza stressed in a radio
interview 'Israel is not at war' with Fatah and other supporters of the
autonomy deal. He said Israel stood by its promise to free 'wanted' Fatah
Hawks who turn in their weapons.

FT  01 DEC 93 / US consumer confidence leaps ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US consumer confidence rose nearly 11 points to 71.2 in November, one of the
biggest monthly gains in 25 years and further confirmation of the
accelerating pace of economic growth.
In another sign of economic strength, the Chicago purchasing managers' index
was reported up sharply last month at 65.3 against 57.0 in October,
suggesting buoyant conditions for local manufacturers.
The jump in the consumer confidence index far exceeded Wall Street
projections and prompted a sharp decline in bond prices and a strengthening
of the dollar. This reflected traders' fears that more rapid economic growth
would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest
rates. Share prices, disturbed by the fall in bond prices, rose modestly.
'An improvement of this magnitude has occurred only rarely in the 25-year
history of this survey,' said Mr Fabian Linden of the Conference Board, the
New York business analysis group that compiles the consumer confidence
index. If confidence continued to strengthen 'we can expect pent-up demand
to come to market,' he said.
The board's latest survey of 5,000 households indicated consumers had become
more optimistic about current conditions and about the outlook for the next
six months. The proportion rating business conditions 'bad' was the lowest
in three years. The proportion rating jobs 'plentiful' was up.
The level of consumer confidence remained relatively subdued by the
standards of previous recoveries, when the index rose well above 100.
The index gain is the last piece in a growth jigsaw. In recent weeks,
figures for factory orders, industrial output, retail spending and home
sales all pointed to an acceleration of economic growth to an annual rate of
about 4 per cent in the current quarter.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Russia boosts weapons exports
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday announced a big boost to its arms trade, with measures to
support the increased export of weapons.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister for foreign economic
relations, said Russia had earned Dollars 2.5bn from the sale of arms in the
past year but was looking for a bigger market - up to Dollars 9bn a year -
in coming years.
Mr Shokhin is embroiled in a struggle for power with Mr Boris Fyodorov,
deputy premier for finance, over who represents the government in relations
with the international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and
IMF.
Mr Shokhin said Russia would use export credits to finance the sale of arms,
and would establish an export-import bank dedicated to the arms trade.
'If the international community supports the transformations going on in
this country it should understand our desire to see Russia as an equal
partner in this area and eliminate discriminatory barriers. This means
changing legislation in countries which describes Russia as a communist
state,' he said.
Mr Shokhin was speaking after a trip by senior Russian officials to the
United Arab Emirates, during which contracts were signed for arms exports,
including the newest armoured personnel carriers. He said that 'we hope for
billions of dollars of business' from Gulf states.
Noting that Russia is owed Dollars 5bn by Iraq, Mr Shokhin said that 'if you
can cool the heat of the ambitions of the Iraqi leadership', sanctions
against the country could be lifted. Russia would then demand repayment of
its debt in oil as the only means of payment available to Iraq.
The deputy premier's optimism over arms sales has been echoed recently by
other senior officials, including Mr Mikhail Maley, chairman of the
interdepartmental commission of the Securities Council, who said that a 'new
concept' was being worked out which would mean a sharp increase in the sale
of arms abroad, largely aimed at achieving partial self-financing in the
military industries - hard hit over the past two years by government cuts.
Among areas considering arms purchases, Mr Shokhin listed the US, where the
vertical take-off Yak101 is being tested; Sweden, testing the T72 tank; and
Turkey, looking at helicopter purchases.
Russia has postponed privatisation of half the Lada car plant due to
disputes between its management and the government over where share auctions
should be held, Reuter reports from Moscow.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Bosnia says partition talks have reached new impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bosnian government yesterday said fresh partition talks had reached an
impasse and accused their Serbian adversaries of hijacking the agenda from
the European Union only hours after the resumption of negotiations among the
republic's three warring parties.
Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, warned that
the Geneva talks were in danger of collapse because the Serbs had insisted
on reopening negotiations on Sarajevo.
Before the collapse of peace talks in September, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, international envoys, had won endorsement from Serb, Moslem and
Croat leaders to place the Bosnian capital under UN administration for two
years.
'Owen is trying to focus on the division of Sarajevo, which is unfortunate,
shameful and counter-productive,' Mr Sacirbey told reporters at the Palais
des Nations in Geneva.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said there had been 'no
progress' after the close of the first round of talks with Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader.
Despite the slim hope of reaching a settlement to end 19 months of war, Mr
Sacirbey said the Bosnian government would not abandon peace talks. But he
said the Bosnian delegation had raised a complaint with unnamed parties in
the EU about deviating from the plan proposed by foreign ministers on
Monday.
Lord Owen on Monday said Sarajevo and access to the sea from the Croats
remained the biggest issues, echoing Mr Milosevic's earlier comments.
In recent bilateral meetings, Serb leaders have pushed a 'quality land for
quantity' line in pressing for the exchange of Serb-held districts of
Sarajevo for Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Clarke banks on big spending cuts: Slow-burn tax rises will
take effect as recovery gains pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke delivered an overtly political Budget yesterday, designed
to boost the nation's finances with big spending cuts and slow-burn tax
rises that will hit large numbers of voters as the economy recovers.
He announced measures to defuse public anger and Tory dismay at earlier
plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel and power but singled out
home owners, motorists, smokers and holidaymakers for tax increases,
effective mainly from April 1995.
At the heart of Mr Clarke's skilfully packaged Budget was a cut in the
public-sector borrowing requirement next year of about Pounds 6bn, big
public spending cuts and tax rises next year of Pounds 1.68bn to add to the
Pounds 6.7bn planned by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor.
Mr Clarke took a calculated gamble with public-sector employees by
announcing tough measures to restrain pay as part of a cash freeze in
government running costs for the next three years.
The chancellor's 'no-nonsense Budget', which for the first time combined
spending and tax-raising, surprised the Commons and financial markets with
its larger-than-expected cuts in public expenditure in 1994-95.
The cuts, he told the House of Commons, were intended to 'sort out the
problem of public borrowing once and for all'. They will 'eliminate
government borrowing entirely by the end of the decade' and 'establish sound
public finances into the next century'.
However, Mr Clarke's confidently delivered first Budget plots only modest
growth of 2.5 per cent for the economy next year although underlying
inflation, at 3.25 per cent, would stay within the 1 per cent to 4 per cent
target next year and fall further later.
His message was warmly welcomed by industrialists and the financial markets,
impressed by the plans to cut public borrowing. The response from some
economists was more guarded. They feared that proposals for higher taxes in
future years would take spending power out of the economy as it tries to
recover from recession.
The chancellor followed the example of Mr Lamont's March Budget by
announcing only modest tax increases for the coming financial year but a
broadening of the tax base to yield big revenue gains in 1995-96 and
1996-97.
From April 1995, mortgage interest relief will be granted at only 15 per
cent, down from 25 per cent at present and 20 per cent due to come into
force next April. Mr Clarke also announced a further cut in the married
couple's income tax allowance from 1995 onwards to 15 per cent from 20 per
cent due to take effect in 1994-95.
But, heeding the Conservative by-election defeats of the past year, Mr
Clarke took elaborate pains to draw the sting for poorer households from the
extension of VAT to fuel and power. Although he announced indirect taxes on
air travel and insurance premiums and increased duties on petrol and tobacco
by well above the inflation rate, the chancellor avoided extending VAT to
exempt and zero-rated goods and services such as newspapers, food and
sewerage charges.
He confirmed that the state pension retirement age for women would rise from
60 to 65 but not before the year 2010.
As befits a self-proclaimed son of the industrial Midlands, Mr Clarke
announced tax and spending measures to help businesses and jobs. He also
announced a crackdown on tax avoidance to yield Pounds 2bn over the three
years and restrictions on unemployment and invalidity benefit intended to
save Pounds 2.5bn annually from the social security budget by 1996-97.
His speech bore witness to his career as a minister in many big spending
departments before he took over as chancellor in May. He appeared more at
ease outlining the government's spending plans than its tax proposals.
The Budget set a PSBR of Pounds 38bn for 1994-95, compared with the Pounds
44bn envisaged in Mr Lamont's March Budget, and forecast a steady decline in
the deficit to Pounds 12bn by 1997-98 and just Pounds 2bn by 1998-99. The
March Budget estimated that the PSBR would still be Pounds 30bn in 1997-98.
He announced a Pounds 3.6bn reduction in the government's public-expenditure
'control total' to Pounds 251.3bn in 1994-95. However, the government did
not raid its contingency reserve to pay for spending programmes. Instead,
cuts in the reserve of Pounds 3.5bn next year and Pounds 3bn in 1995-96 will
be used to reduce overall spending.
Mr Clarke said he expected the Budget would reduce total public spending in
the next three years by about Pounds 10bn below the level assumed in March.
After taking account of the beneficial effects of recovery in the economy to
a growth rate of 2.5 per cent next year and the first half of 1995, 'the
total reduction in public spending over the next three years compared to the
March Budget projections will be no less than Pounds 15bn', he said.
The chancellor added Pounds 1.675m of new taxes to the Pounds 6.73bn already
decided in Mr Lamont's Budget for 1994-95. Mr Clarke's Budget will add
Pounds 4.9bn in taxes to the Pounds 10.3bn agreed in the March Budget for
1995-96 and a further Pounds 6.08bn for 1996-97.
As a result, the share of tax revenue in national income will rise from 36.5
per cent in this financial year to 39.75 per cent in 1996-97. Some of that
may be paid back as tax cuts. One of the justifications Mr Clarke gave for
tackling the public-sector deficit was the government's 'long-term tax
cutting agenda'.
However, the only beneficiaries of tax cuts were businesses. In a move that
will cost Pounds 830m in 1994-95, and Pounds 940m the following year, the
chancellor announced a 0.2 per cent cut in the main rate of employers'
national insurance contributions and 1 per cent reductions in employers'
contributions for staff earning less than Pounds 200 a week.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Markets welcome assault on PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets gave a warm welcome to the Budget, marking up equities,
gilts and sterling in response to a larger-than-expected cut in the
projected public-sector borrowing requirement.
Most economists, including five of the seven 'wise men' who advise the
chancellor, hailed the focus on reduced public spending and the fact that
the package avoids significant near-term additions to the tax burden.
Professor Patrick Minford, one of the seven, said: 'This is a skilful Budget
which has moved public spending control back to the centre of the budgetary
process.'
Other economists warned that extra taxes planned for 1995 and beyond would
take a lot of spending power out of the economy.
Mr Andrew Sentance, director of economics at the Confederation of British
Industry and another of the 'wise men', said the chancellor might have to
cut interest rates to sustain economic recovery.
The FT-SE 100 share index rose 31.1 points on the day to close at 3,166.9.
UK gilts rose 1 1/2 points in response to the PSBR projections. Sterling
gained half a pfennig to close in London at DM2.5475, firming slightly in
New York to DM2.5486.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Fiscal magician conjures away gloom on deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor donned the mantle of a fiscal magician yesterday by conjuring
away previous gloomy projections of large budget deficits over the next few
years.
Against fevered speculation in recent weeks of large tax rises, Mr Kenneth
Clarke performed the vanishing act largely through announcing deep cuts in
public spending that will hit defence, local government and transport
particularly hard while allowing room for growth in social security
spending.
An important element of Mr Clarke's plan to cut the budget deficit to Pounds
12bn in 1997-98 - as against the Pounds 30bn predicted by his predecessor Mr
Norman Lamont in the March Budget - is the Treasury's new projection of
robust economic growth during the 1990s, with inflation remaining weak.
The Treasury believes fairly strong economic activity over the next few
years should boost tax revenues, while because of low wage and price
pressures, spending can be cut without significantly affecting the level of
public services.
While keeping the Treasury's previous forecast that the gap between public
spending and revenues will be about Pounds 50bn this financial year, Mr
Clarke reduced the forecast of the 1994-95 deficit to Pounds 38bn from the
Pounds 44bn predicted in March.
To achieve the cut, he announced a reduction in the public expenditure
'control total' to Pounds 251.3bn in the coming financial year.
The chancellor said the 1994-95 spending reduction was Pounds 3.6bn,
allowing for an accounting reclassification of government payments to
private-sector electricity generators.
Total general government spending, which takes in cyclical social security
spending and debt interest, is pencilled in at Pounds 292bn in the next
financial year as against the Pounds 296bn previously projected.
Under the chancellor's new plans, the public-sector borrowing requirement
for 1995-96 is set at Pounds 30bn, less than the Pounds 39bn projected in
March. Part of the reason for the more bullish projection is that in this
year the control total has been cut by Pounds 1.5bn on the government's
previous plans while revenue growth is expected to be relatively high.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Tory applause masks signs of unease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke's gamble that Conservative MPs would unite behind a
package balancing still higher taxes with deep cuts in public spending last
night appeared to have paid off.
The Tory right applauded the additional Pounds 10bn of spending cuts over
three years announced by the chancellor, while those on the party's
centre-left were relieved the burden of the latest tax increases would fall
on the better-off.
But there were signs that the traditional applause on the day for a
'skilful' Budget disguised unease over the implications of a package which
ministers admitted was much tougher than it looked.
In spite of an effective and relaxed performance from Mr Clarke in his
Budget debut, senior ministers left no doubt that they expected the
legislation which would implement the measures to face a rough political
ride.
'He has spread the misery with great skill, but it is still misery,' one
member of the cabinet commented.
The centrist Mr Clarke and his rightwing deputy, Mr Michael Portillo,
launched an immediate campaign to persuade their allies on different wings
of the party that the package had to be accepted in its entirety to preserve
the political balance. Mr Portillo, the heir apparent of the Thatcherite
right, saw his already rising political star boosted by the scale of the
spending cuts.
Mr Clarke told a crowded meeting of Tory backbench MPs that the measures to
cut decisively the budget deficit represented the final piece in the jigsaw
needed to ensure a steady recovery in the government's political fortunes.
The implication was that if the party took tough decisions now, there could
yet be scope for reductions in the basic rate of income tax before the
general election due by mid-1997.
A relatively generous compensation package to ease the introduction of value
added tax on domestic fuel also appeared likely to defuse the threatened
rebellion on the Conservative benches over an issue that has dogged the
government for nine months.
There was also palpable relief that the chancellor has not extended VAT into
areas such as food and children's clothing, and applause for the series of
measures to help small businesses.
A new child care allowance for single parents and an increase in tax
allowances for the blind were carefully designed to reassure the party left
that tougher rules on other benefits did not signal a move to dismantle the
welfare state.
Deep cuts in the defence budget, the proposed cuts in invalidity and
unemployment benefits, a sharp rise in petrol tax and a levy on insurance
premiums were all identified as potential political flashpoints.
Mr Clarke skilfully dispersed the tax rises across a range of measures to
avoid a focal point for a backbench rebellion comparable to the uproar
caused by the extension of VAT on fuel.
But ministers acknowledged the freeze on income tax allowances, higher
petrol prices, the new insurance and airport taxes and the further cut in
mortgage interest relief would hit directly the Conservatives' traditional
supporters in the shire counties.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, signalled the start of an opposition
onslaught on the government's 'broken tax promises', charging that
taxpayers, the disabled and unemployed were being made to pay for the
government's economic incompetence.
Labour calculated the cumulative tax increases since last March would cost
the average family Pounds 10 per week from next April and Pounds 16 per week
from 1995.
The additional cuts assume the government can stick to a freeze on public
sector pay next year, a policy likely to be threatened by industrial
discontent in the main public services.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Ferruzzi creditors approve rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank creditors representing more than 85 per cent of the total borrowings of
Italy's Ferruzzi group yesterday gave their approval to a controversial
rescue plan drawn up by leading Italian lenders.
Reaching the 85 per cent level means shareholders' meetings to approve the
recapitalisation of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company and
Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, will go ahead as planned today
and tomorrow.
Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank behind the rescue plan, and Mr Guido
Rossi, Ferfin chairman, had stressed the restructuring could be put at risk
if the 85 per cent level was not reached.
Securing the agreement of enough creditors became a virtual certainty
yesterday after Deutsche Bank, one of the main critics of the restructuring
plan, broke ranks with other leading foreign creditors and accepted the
proposal. The decision, ostensibly for 'political' reasons, weakened the
front of non-Italian banks, which opposed the Mediobanca scheme when it was
presented last month.
In contacts with other foreign creditors, Credit Suisse said efforts to
prepare an alternative scheme would continue, in spite of Deutsche Bank's
decision to resign from the committee of five foreign banks. The other banks
include Barclays, Union Bank of Switzerland and Citibank.
Last night, the four remaining banks repeated their refusal to be railroaded
into a settlement. They said 'such a complex plan cannot be the object of
careful revisions and consideration within the very short time requested by
Ferruzzi'.
Credit Suisse said the foreign banks' group would meet on Wednesday and
hoped to share its conclusions with other foreign creditors before
Christmas.
The Mediobanca plan calls for moratoria and below-market rates on interest
payments on Ferruzzi group borrowings, as well as reschedulings of most
debts. Ferfin had net borrowings of L22,600bn (Dollars 13.4bn) at the end of
June.
Last week, Mediobanca issued an 'updated plan' which went some way to
meeting foreign banks' criticisms by removing a number of companies, to
which foreign banks were most exposed, from the rescheduling proposals.
Shareholders in Ferfin and Montedison will be also asked to approve legal
action against Price Waterhouse, which audited the two companies. The boards
of Ferfin and Montedison say the firm failed to spot severe financial
irregularities which allegedly arose under the previous management.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Carlton bids Pounds 758m for Central rival: The first of the
UK's big commercial television takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications launched the UK's ITV takeover
game yesterday with an agreed bid for Central Independent Television which
valued the second largest ITV company at Pounds 758m (Dollars 1.1bn).
The cash and shares offer at the equivalent of Pounds 26 a share came just
five days after Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, proposed
changing the ITV ownership rules to allow, for the first time, a single
company to own a total of two broadcasting licences.
Mr Green, will become the most powerful figure in UK commercial television
if the Central deal, conditional on parliamentary approval, goes through.
The combined group will command around 30 per cent of total ITV advertising
revenue. Central already owns 20 per cent of Meridian, the south of England
broadcaster, while Carlton holds 20 per cent of Good Morning Television, the
commercial broadcaster.
Carlton, whose interests range from television facilities and professional
equipment to video-cassette duplication, yesterday underlined its growing
strength by announcing a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
126.1m.
Central's share price rose more than Pounds 4 yesterday to Pounds 25.73 and
Carlton finished 30p up at 797p.
Two other forces in independent television are also expected to make
takeover moves. Granada Group is thought to be eyeing London Weekend
Television, a company in which it holds 20 per cent, and Lord Hollick,
chairman of Meridian Broadcasting, is predicted to go for either Anglia
Television or HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west. But neither Mr
Gerry Robinson, the Granada chief executive, nor Lord Hollick like the
current ITV share prices and it is far from clear when they will make a
move.
Mr Green said yesterday that the Central deal would create 'a serious
critical mass' of programme production and promised that appropriate Carlton
network programmes would be made in Central's Nottingham studios, which are
underused.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbroker Goldman Sachs, said last
night: 'In television terms it's a great move. It's a real power base.'
The deal will lead to a reorganisation of administration and support
services and there are fears of job losses.
Ms Anne Rawcliffe-King, of the broadcasting union Bectu, warned that the
concentration of power within ITV resulting from the takeover would
'seriously unbalance the system'.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Steep rise in China pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign companies operating in China are facing steep rises in local labour
costs, according to a survey, writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor.
The Wyatt Company, a US-based consulting firm, says salaries of Chinese
nationals working for foreign ventures have risen 22 per cent this year,
faster than the 15 per cent increase in 1992.
Foreign managers in Beijing have reported it is increasingly difficult to
keep good Chinese staff because newly established enterprises lure them away
with high salaries. Inflation is also a factor.
But salary levels are still low by western standards. A manager working for
a foreign representative office earns about Dollars 7,800 a year including
allowances, while a manager in a joint venture earns Dollars 3,000.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Assurance over Pakistan credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Pakistani government yesterday acknowledged that government borrowings
from the central bank had increased rapidly this year, but said it hoped the
trend would change by next month, with new credit raised from non-bank
borrowing and an increased flow of external commercial bank credits.
The former government of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker prime minister, had
set a target of Rs20bn (Dollars 660m) for official borrowings for the whole
year, down from last year's Rs65bn. However, during its three months in
office his government borrowed Rs28bn, while the new government of Ms
Benazir Bhutto has borrowed another Rs5bn, with almost seven months before
the current fiscal year ends in June.
The borrowings have raised fresh concern that the government may not meet
its crucial economic targets, notably reducing the federal budgetary
deficit. Pakistan hopes to negotiate IMF and World Bank loans worth almost
Dollars 1.5bn within the next three months, and reducing the deficit would
be one of the most critical conditions.
Last year's deficit reached 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product, against
a target of 5.5 per cent. Islamabad is trying to bring this year's deficit
down to 5.4 per cent.
Mr V A Jafarey, the prime minister's adviser on finance and the de facto
finance minister, said in an interview yesterday: 'It is true that we have
inherited a large increase in borrowings from the State Bank', the central
bank. However, he hoped that the borrowings would start coming down within
the next three weeks, once the government was able to raise fresh funds
through officially backed savings schemes, bonds and external finances in
the form of commercial bank loans.
Some officials expect further improvements in the country's economic
performance in coming months, with a recent recovery in the foreign exchange
reserves to some Dollars 800m, up from around Dollars 180m in July.

An unidentified Iranian yesterday hijacked a government aircraft with 38
people on board during a domestic flight in Iran then surrendered after it
landed in southern Iraq, AP reports from Nicosia.
The Iraqi news agency, INA, said the male hijacker gave himself up six hours
after the twin-prop Fokker Friendship F-27, owned by Iran's Oil Ministry,
landed in the Iraqi port city of Basra.
It did not say whether the hijacker was armed, or if any of the passengers
were hurt in the ordeal. INA also did not say what the hijacker's demands
were, except that he requested asylum in Iraq or any other country.
The hijacker's wife and five children were with him on the flight, INA said.
The agency said the aircraft landed in Basra following a request by Iranian
authorities. Iran's official news agency, IRNA, said Iranian officials had
requested that Iraq refuse to provide ground services for the hijacked
aircraft.

FT  30 NOV 93 / Superstate nightmare troubles Hurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, yesterday criticised what he
called the 'nightmare' scenario of a European superstate, and declared he
was confident that the 'centralising tendency' in Europe was at an end.
Speaking in Bologna, Italy, in his first important speech on Europe since
the German constitutional court ratified the Maastricht treaty last month,
Mr Hurd insisted that the principle of subsidiarity should now be the
touchstone for the European Union.
'Subsidiarity is not only about rolling back the frontiers of the Community,
where these have advanced beyond common sense; it also means moving forward
with a lightness of touch,' Mr Hurd said in comments which resonated with
the British government's relief that the pace of European integration had
faltered in recent months.
Legislation was a key area where the powers of Europe should be trimmed,
since EU legislation had now become so intrusive and extensive that it
risked devaluing the EU's reputation, Mr Hurd said. He insisted Community
legislation should be introduced only when it would do the 'least possible
violence' to national legal systems.
Foreign policy and employment law had to remain firmly in the domain of
sovereign governments.
The narrowness of Maastricht ratification in Denmark, France, Britain and
Germany served as a clear warning that 'sharing of sovereignty and
centralising tendency, has for the time being run its course', he said,
citing labour costs and trade barriers as the key challenges now facing
Europe.

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats will try to prevent
an early election in the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt after a financial
scandal precipitated the resignation of the entire government at the
weekend.
Elections are not due until next June as part of a marathon of federal and
state elections being held against a background of declining support for the
established political parties, in western, and particularly in eastern
Germany.
Instead, the CDU, in an attempt to limit the political damage, has nominated
Mr Christoph Bergner to replace Mr Werner Munch, the outgoing prime minister
of Saxony-Anhalt, and form a new government.
The state audit office had last week confirmed that Mr Munch and three other
west German ministers together paid themselves in excess of DM900,000
(Dollars 532,500) over a period of two years.

PERSONAL IMPACT: THE ART OF GOOD COMMUNICATION
by Michael Shea
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 17.99 196 pages
The bookshops of the world, claims Michael Shea, former press secretary to
the Queen, overflow with personal improvement texts of highly questionable
quality. Quite so.
Shea's own addition to some already groaning shelves is a disappointing
effort in which the blindingly obvious has been dressed up in dubious jargon
designed to grace it with some authority.
His work is hailed by the publishers as a manual bursting with hints
intended to improve the reader's personal impact in a 'media democracy'
where all-important impressions are formed and fixed in 15 seconds. So never
slouch, don't fiddle, don't ramble, avoid sweaty palms and don't get too
close if you've got halitosis. Shea begins profoundly, by suggesting that
the most successful people in corporate and public life are those who know
best how to communicate. He then conjures up three characters who he
subjects to a series of career challenges, ranging from job interviews to
public speaking and media interviews.
John Hustle is brash, pushy and glib with 'a carpet salesman's answer to
everything' while Alan Grey is quiet, a little scruffy and a bit of a
non-entity. David Wright is the clever-clogs of the bunch, smiling
agreeably, well-groomed and oozing confidence. He is presented as 'the man
most likely to' but is likely to be about as popular around the office as a
time-and-motion study expert.
Here is a book stuffed full of paralanguage, eyelock, language acquisition
devices and inter-personal communication techniques. Cut away the
technospeak and what do you get? If you are addressing an audience and
people look puzzled, you have to say more; if they are upright and alert,
you can rest assured you have their attention.
If you want to get the low-down on someone in order to work out how best to
interact with them, then study their handbags, suits, necklines and beards
(hopefully not all found on the same person).
Anyone who is still trawling up the infamous pre-election television debate
between sweaty, shady Richard Nixon and John F Kennedy Shea, the
president-to-be with 'the tingle-tongue taste' smile, in order to
demonstrate the dangers of television, must be in dire trouble.
The author calls in aid everyone from Demosthenes to Talleyrand and, in a
more contemporary - though no more relevant - vein, the likes of Michael
Jackson, Maddona and Mrs Thatcher to drive home his messages. He ends with
'form reports' on public figures like Labour leader John Smith ('flat and
boring' paralanguage), John Harvey-Jones ('very colourful ties') and Jeremy
Paxman ('supercilious, arrogant, almost facetious'). Very perceptive.
Shea says his is not a 'how to' book but more a reference chart which may be
useful in developing your overall impact. He claims the skills set out can
make the difference between success and a life of missed opportunities.
The overriding impression left, however, is that anyone who requires such
fundamental advice can't really believe they have a hope in hell of aspiring
to be stand-in chauffeur, never mind chief executive.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (32): Nooks and crannies
from a fogies' cult
</HEADLINE>

THE SPECTATOR ANNUAL
Edited by Dominic Lawson
HarperCollins, Pounds 20, 309 pages
The Spectator is a remarkable survival. When Lord Gilmour owned it in the
early 1960s, he said that it could never regularly sell more than 50,000
copies a week and was unlikely ever to make much money. In those years it
trailed the New Statesman in readership and perhaps in prestige, though
intellectual fashion was already beginning to change away from socialism
towards a more radical liberalism.
Today The Spectator is a kind of English cult, way ahead of the Statesman.
Part of the Conrad Black/Telegraph empire, it appears financially sound.
Liberalism has given way to conservatism, old fogies  - in Alan Watkins's
phrase - to young fogies, and there is another oddity. The Spectator must be
one of the few publications in recent times to have been edited by father
and son. Nigel Lawson was the editor in the late 1960s; his son, Dominic,
has been in charge for the last few years.
P D James, the detective writer, is wrong when she writes in her foreword to
this year's Spectator Annual that no one has ever cast the paper aside with
the comment 'nothing worth reading this week'. There are times when Jeffrey
Bernard is unwell and Christopher Fildes is on holiday when one does
precisely that. On the other hand, there are weeks when, skipping a few of
its regular columnists, The Spectator is pretty compelling almost from
beginning to end.
That is the merit of the annual collection. There is bound to be something
that one can pick up with pleasure.
This year's choice (much of it is from 1992) starts with a wonderful
interview by Candida Crewe of the Tory MP, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn. On his
colleague Edwina Currie, Fairbairn comments (quite unfairly) 'I can't stand
the hag'. And with that, notes Ms Crewe, 'he thumped the desk again and took
a final swig from his glass of Meerlust'. Where else would you find a minor
politician written about at such length and with such candour?
The Spectator is good at digging into the nooks and crannies of English
life. There is an essay by Hardy Amies, the fashion designer, which tells
much that one didn't know - 'I wanted to work in Europe but ended up in
Birmingham'. Then it turns out that Amies is a friend of Enoch Powell, a
real Spectator stalwart.
At times the paper has a very good Diary. Max Hastings, the editor of the
Daily Telegraph, writes well about the problems of running a broadsheet when
the tabloids are making the running by intrusions on royal privacy. Alec
Guinness and P D James herself have come up with excellent diary
contributions, all of which suggests a sense of variety.
The trouble is that the variety all comes recognisably from the same stable.
Some of it is actually reprinted in the Telegraph, and even where it is not,
the writers heavily overlap. Perhaps this is a virtue. If so, it could be
extended. Andrew Knight, who was once part of the group, is an accomplished
journalist, but appears here only once. Conrad Black would make an
outstanding political columnist, but appears not at all. Christopher Fildes,
with his City and Suburban, deserves more space than he gets.
Still, nothing in the collection will shock you. It is the perfect bedside
book.

THE OXFORD DICTIONARY FOR THE BUSINESS WORLD
Oxford University Press Pounds 15.95 996 pages
It is possible that a Sassenach closing a deal on the Isle of Skye or some
similar place might need to know the meaning of the Scots word 'mickle'.
It's easy to confuse with muckle; both mean a large amount. But by the time
a business person had consulted this dictionary for the meaning of 'Mickey
Finn' (a drugged drink), would it not be too late?
From Dr Johnson onwards, lexicographers have rejoiced in idiosyncracy when
selecting words for inclusion in their works and so it is here. 'Yuppie'
(young, ambitious and so on) is just about acceptable, but 'yum-yum'
(expressing pleasure from eating or the prospect of eating') seems to have
escaped from a dictionary of nursery expressions.
To be fair, however,in just under a thousand pages it describes most
important business terms and even manages quite a few basic computing
expressions, although remarkably neither facilities management nor
outsourcing are included.
And the businessperson looking for enlightenment on data communications and
networking will have only intermittent success. Local and wide area networks
are included, but these terms are comparatively well understood. Where,
however, is the explanation of 'hub' or 'router'? Such a definition could
prove invaluable to, say, a marketmaker faced with a bland 'Sorry guv, the
hub's gone down' when inquiring about the loss of stock prices from the
trading screen.
There are tips for making a business speech ('the speaker should appear
enthusiastic without being irrational or emotional') and constructing a
business plan ('if an outline projection of cash flow for 10 years can be
provided, the picture becomes increasingly credible'). Uruguay is described
and the Uruguay Round defined. Is 'thatcher - n. (Old English)' a joke?
Thatcherism does not feature.
Alas, some of the country definitions are already dated. Under 'United
Kingdom': 'the economy is based on manufacturing industry.'

LEADERSHIP &amp; INFORMATION PROCESSING
by Robert G Lord and Karen J. Maher
Routledge Pounds 13.99
THE INDEPENDENT BOARD DIRECTOR
by David Clutterbuck and Peter Waine
McGraw-Hill Pounds 24.95
THE ECONOMICS OF TRAINING
by Paul G Chapman
Harvester/Wheatsheaf Pounds 17.95
It is an American belief that executive leadership is vital in understanding
the workings and performance of organisations. This belief is probably
justified in the American context, though not necessarily so in others in
others, for example in Japan.
Lord and Maher have attempted, at last, to get away from traditional
approaches to understanding leadership which tend to examine leaders in
isolation from their environment.
Their book has an opaque title and their prose is rather academic.
Nevertheless, they have produced an important study which considers how
executives make decisions, and how the acceptance of their decisions is
constrained by the perceptions that others have of the style and content of
their leadership.
They conclude that leadership affects and is constrained by cognitive and
social processes at all levels of human systems, and it similarly affects
and is constrained by task-performance at each of these levels.
This sounds common sense, but the book applies the approach in some detail,
showing why females may not be perceived as leaders, how leaders can expand
the scope of their discretion, and precisely how context may limit both
leadership possibilities and perceptions.
Practically, Lord and Maher suggest that leaders often address problems from
too narrow a perspective. They present four models of information
processing, which can act as alternative ways of understanding and
approaching problems.
Business leaders in Britain are finding themselves forced to take positions
on the question of non-executive directors - or Independent Board Directors,
as Clutterbuck &amp; Waine prefer to call them.
In The Independent Board Director, the authors present findings from their
research which suggest that NEDs are often the wrong people for the post,
appointed for the wrong reasons, and their talents are poorly utilised. NEDs
themselves are often unsure of what is expected of them, and companies which
could most benefit from NEDs - smaller companies, which often lack depth of
management expertise - are the least likely to have them.
Clutterbuck and Waine counter these maladies by setting out best practice in
the field. The material is organised in chapters which address simple
questions, such as: 'so what is a non-executive director?', 'what does an
effective NED do?', 'why do people become NEDs?', and so on. The most useful
part of the book is the chapter on 'how can independent directors contribute
more?' and that on 'choosing and using Independent directors.'
Clutterbuck and Waine make a strong case for training programmes for
independent board directors. But does training provide value for money? Paul
G Chapman's The Economics of Training provides a reasonably comprehensive
account of the application of economic ideas to the analysis of training,
and attempts to develop a general theory based on the human capital
approach, the transactions cost model, signalling, asymmetric information
and labour structure.
Of more immediate interest to British readers will be Chapman's critique of
past and current UK training policy and the formulation of training policy
in international context.
A particularly strong section investigates empirical evidence of the value
and effect of training programmes, and he concludes that the sad history of
Britain's deteriorating training policies is best explained in terms of the
prevailing economic philosophy rather than of hard economic judgment.
'Like the annual Budget,' counsels Chapman, 'policy changes should be
periodic and limited. In an imperfect world, policy should aim to improve
existing training arrangements rather than searching endlessly for the
'right' policy.' Excellent advice, but perhaps it will only happen when we
have an environment in which firms can create cooperatively the solutions
which are needed by industry and commerce.

THE SOCIAL DIMENSION: EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
by Michael Gold (editor)
Macmillan, Pounds 13.99 276 pages
Underlying the debate about European-wide employment regulation lie a series
of controversial assumptions about the relationship between labour market
systems and economic performance.
The fundamental assumption, shared by most of the Christian and Social
Democrats who run the European Commission, is that the relative economic
success of northern European countries such as Germany and Holland has been
achieved because of, not in spite of, their systems of labour regulation and
integration.
This view is challenged by many of Europe's economists as well as most of
the British Conservative party, who view such arrangements as hopelessly
inflexible.
Even an open-minded Conservative who did accept that the strong voice of
German labour, tempered by strict legal restraints, has contributed to high
productivity and wage discipline in Germany, would still reject such a model
for Britain.
Britain, the argument might run, has always had an open, volatile economy
and therefore needs a flexible 'hire and fire' labour market, especially if
it is to compensate for low labour mobility and low educational standards.
To a surprising extent this 'horses for courses' argument is now accepted by
the EC, as Michael Gold recognises in his introductory essay to The Social
Dimension.
The 'Germanic' model of industrial relations no longer directly inspires EU
employment legislation as it did in the late 1970s when workers on company
boards was first proposed. Despite British complaints that Brussels is
trying to impose a 'continental' model of labour regulation on the UK, the
Commission is now far more sensitive to the subsidiarity argument in
national labour markets.
Since the late 1980s the argument for Europe-wide legislation has shifted.
At one level it has become more political - the single market has given
capital new advantages, so there must be something for labour too, hence the
1989 Social Chapter.
But as Europe's economies have become more integrated, the primary concern
has been to prevent a downward spiral of competition over labour conditions
 -so-called 'social dumping'. There is little hard evidence that such
dumping is on the increase, but it is a possibility as barriers fall.
These essays do not analyse such assumptions in depth. Essentially they
provide a textbook describing the minutae of institutions and existing
legislation, especially in the three key areas where the EU's minimum
standards really do make a difference to working life: health and safety,
equal pay and redundancies.
The essays offer a useful historical perspective. Gold, for example, points
out that the arguments between neo-liberals and regulators go back to
Article 117 of the original Treaty of Rome.
The Article argued that the condition of labour would improve spontaneously,
encouraging the harmonisation of 'social systems' as a result of the common
market. The same Article argued, however, that regulation and
'administrative action' was required to ensure those outcomes.
Finally, although much of the book's technical detail will still be relevant
in 10 years time, it was completed before the Maastricht Treaty was
ratified, so it already feels out of date.

THE LIMITS OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY: INVESTMENT POLITICS IN SWEDEN
by Jonas Pontusson
Cornell University Press Pounds 23.55 261 pages
THE VOLVO EXPERIENCE
by Christian Berggren
Macmillan Pounds 25.00 286 pages
Today's Sweden has become paradise lost for many of its social democratic
admirers. Until recently it was the paradigm of the progressive society,
with a generous welfare state for all, full employment, peaceful industrial
relations and successful global corporations.
Now it looks just another depressed western European economy with soaring
dole queues, a huge public sector deficit, negative growth rates and
plummeting living standards. The gravediggers who have been gathering around
the Swedish Model for over 20 years finally look as if they have a corpse to
bury. Both Jonas Pontusson and Christian Berggren in their differing ways
provide invaluable insights into why the country is no longer what it used
to be. Pontusson's rigorous analysis of investment politics in contemporary
Sweden breaks fresh ground, despite its Marxist framework, by focusing on
the country's powerful private manufacturing sector and its needs on global
markets.
Too often Sweden has been treated in splendid isolation, as a social
experiment on the fringes of northern Europe which could flourish with
little concern for events in the outside world. This was always a false
one-dimensional picture and during the 1980s it became a sad delusion. Under
global pressures the ruling Social Democrats pushed through a perhaps
over-hasty deregulation of its financial system and as a result lost control
of Sweden's economic destiny.
There can no longer be Social Democracy in one country. The country's
economy is now painfully vulnerable to short-term speculation, as was shown
in November 1992 when despite an impressive display of national unity in
defence of the fixed rate of the krona, global forces forced a massive
devaluation.
Pontusson argues convincingly that the once-powerful labour movement was
compelled to recognise its own limitations in the face of capital when the
manual unions pressed from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s to establish
so-called collective wage earner funds which, in their original version,
aimed at providing the trade unions with a dominant ownership role over
Sweden's corporate investment strategies.
The controversy revealed the strength of the country's private employers,
who mobilised effectively to block such a radical proposal. By contrast, the
manual unions failed to carry their members with them over the issue.
Renowned for their pragmatism and positive attitudes to structural change,
the unions became too ideological and were unable to convince their own rank
and file that the funds were in their own best interests.
However, at the same time the unions were successful in securing legislation
that introduced worker participation into Swedish industry. This was not the
intricate, formalised German model of codetermination and works councils,
but it has provided Swedish employers with an invaluable system to
strengthen workplace support for structural change. Berggren's book on
Sweden is a sorry tale. Volvo under Pehr Gyllenhammar's often visionary but
autocratic leadership became the wonder of the global auto industry as it
abandoned mass production methods at its new plants in favour of
team-working and multi-skilling.
By fusing computer-based technology with labour-intensive craft skills, the
company broke from the old dehumanising methods of the assembly line and
division of labour pioneered by Henry Ford, at least in its new plants
although not in Volvo's homebase in Gothenburg. Industrial sociologists sang
the praises of the Volvo.
Other Swedish enterprises outside auto production followed suit. But their
strategies were not really motivated by altruism. With high worker turnover
and absenteeism in a tight labour market where open unemployment was not a
policy option, they had little obvious strategic choice until the 1980s when
many began - for a variety of reasons - to establish production plants
outside Sweden. Finally, last year Volvo decided to shut its showcase
Uddevalla and Kalmar plants in response to a crisis of excess capacity in a
depressed world market.
The company was keen to emphasise its decision was not a vote of no
confidence by management in the new production methods but a sad consequence
of commercial pressure. But it was always debatable whether the Volvo
methods made financial or industrial sense. In short, during the 1980s the
country could no longer pursue progressive ideas on how to make cars. It
faced increasing market competition where cutting high unit labour costs and
raising productivity were more important than humanising the content of
work.
As Swedes agonise over whether Volvo should become junior partner to
Renault, the French state-run giant, they face the harsh consequences of
being a small open country in a hostile global economy. Having avoided two
world wars and created one of the most enviable of societies, Sweden's luck
may perhaps have run out. These two books provide a nostalgic reminder of
the country's exceptionalism before its fall.

ART &amp; BUSINESS
by Marjory Jacobson
Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 32 224 pages 330 illustrations
A visitor to the First Bank of Minneapolis in the 1980s might have found
himself (or herself) in Controversy Corridor. This is where the art from the
corporate collection was exiled if six or more of the staff found it
distasteful. But, to stimulate thought, the iconoclasts had to justify its
removal from their area.
Dennis Evans took over as president of the Bank just when de-regulation was
churning up the US banking industry. He bought pictures not as an investment
but as a management tool. He believed that an environment of challenging
contemporary art would help his staff abandon past practices and cope better
with new concepts. For a few short years the Bank was one of the main
collectors in the field, amassing 3,000 works by such avant-garde names as
Anselm Kiefer, George Baselitz, and Gilbert and George. It ended in tears.
In 1988 the Bank made a loss of Dollars 310m; Evans resigned; and the
collection was sold.
The experience of the First Bank of Minneapolis can be paralleled throughout
the world. Corporate art is invariably the passion of one senior executive
who is in a position to win over dubious colleagues. The workforce is
usually apathetic; the collections concentrate on the contemporary but soon
become locked in a time warp; initial enthusiasm lapses.
It should not be so. The case for companies to buy art is unassailable.
Redecoration is inevitable when moving to new offices so art can be tax
deductible. In theory it could well prove a good investment. It brightens up
the building and can motivate staff, persuading them that they work for a
go-ahead organisation. It allows the company to glow as the modern patron,
the friend of budding artists.
And yet for every convinced corporate collector, such as Unilever, ICI,
Arthur Andersen, and Fleming's Bank, there are a thousand unaware businesses
surviving in an art-free environment. They might allow themselves a
philistine grin when companies, from Polly Peck to BP, sell off their art
and antiques at a loss.
The fact is that hanging the walls with canvases by Sol LeWitt, and placing
a sculpture by Elizabeth Frink in the reception area, will not automatically
improve productivity or profits. All it does is make a statement about the
company, or rather the view of the company taken by an art-loving director.
And this is how it should be: art for art's sake, not to change the world.
It is sad that few companies have maintained a sufficiently coherent
corporate philosophy to buy art for more than a generation, but that is the
reality that artists must earn to live with.
In Art &amp; Business Marjory Jacobson has travelled the world talking to
companies that do take art seriously. This is not an impartial
investigation, but a polemic. Jacobson is an adviser on art programmes to
companies like AT&amp;T and IBM.
Her book is beautifully illustrated and in its way inspiring. How bold of
BOC to scatter the gardens of its new Surrey HQ with sculptures by Tony
Cragg and Richard Deacon; what a positive statement the installations of
Anish Kapoor in the premises of Starkmann Library Services in London make
about the company.
It would be wonderful if more companies had the confidence to join the club.
But their convictions must be genuine and embrace more than a director or
two. Forcing art into the office environment can be little more than a
gesture. Art &amp; Business wisely avoids examining art as an investment, or
corporate art collections which favour Old Masters and antique furniture. It
is interesting about the corporate museums of Japan and the use of art in
public places. It tells the story of how business should be - sophisticated,
artistically aware, visionary. It should be catalogued under fiction rather
than fact.

CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS: AN ESSAY ON BRITISH POLITICS
by Tony Wright
Routledge Pounds 9.99 157 pages
We British live in a model democracy, as those who rule us never cease to
say. From our schooldays, we are taught that Westminster is the mother of
parliaments, with a democratic tradition which is the envy of the world.
That may be in parts of the globe where elections are infrequent and freedom
constrained. But among the advanced capitalist democracies, the UK system of
government looks anomalous.
One symptom is its pervasive centralism. Local government has no
constitutional status: it exists as a concession graciously granted by the
centre, and the concession has been substantially reclaimed in recent years.
Another is the absence of checks and balances on the power of the executive.
The strengthening of the party system in the elected Commons is unmatched by
a credible second chamber or a written constitution which might impede the
creation of what Lord Hailsham described as an 'elective dictatorship'. The
growth of judicial review has been a small ray of sunshine in a dismal
landscape. A third is the quality of the political process in the UK.
Parties with a minority of the vote command parliamentary majorities,
allowing ill-conceived policies to pass and small swings of the electoral
pendulum to produce far-reaching changes of government.
A year ago, there were encouraging signs of a cross-party movement for
reform. For decades, only the Liberal Democrats had shown any interest in
constitutional change. They were vulnerable to the accusation that their
interest in the subject - particularly in electoral reform - was largely
self-interested.
But the Labour party had begun to think about the UK's political structures.
For as long as Labour managed to win an occasional turn in the driving seat,
there had been little inclination to suggest reconstructing the Westminster
juggernaut. The loss of successive elections, plus restiveness over
centralism in Labour's northern and celtic heartlands, encouraged a new
interest in constitutional reform.
Some Conservatives also seemed open to ideas of constitutional reform.
Former Conservative advisers such as Ferdinand Mount and Graham Mather
called for modernisation, and pointed to the quality of political
decision-making as a factor in the UK's post-war decline.
A year on, the prospect looks much less exciting. Weakened by the collapse
of its European strategy, the government is unable to win unconditional
backbench support even for measures promised in its election manifesto. As
for Labour, John Smith's cautious presbyterianism has reasserted the 'one
more heave' approach.
In this gloomy period for those who wish to see the British state
modernised, this essay from Tony Wright comes as a refreshing read. A
political scientist who has already written several incisive and accessible
tracts, Wright was elected a Labour MP last year. He is one of the party's
awkward squad, a constant prodder against the 'no change' mood which still
dominates the opposition's thinking after 14 years out of power.
Wright eloquently restates the case for moving away from Britain's
centralised, top-down politics towards a more representative and
participatory democracy. In a society where business has become
decentralised, where companies seek to empower managers and staff, there is
a need for a new sort of politics which can be closer to the citizen and
provide better government.
The most interesting part of Wright's argument, however, comes when he
reflects on what such social changes mean for politicians such as himself.
UK parties have offered a monolithic outlook, a take-it-or-leave-it
political manifesto which must be swallowed whole or not at all. In a
society which is becoming more pluralistic, a new model of party politics is
needed.
In this context, electoral reform, with its implicit bias towards coalition
government, should not be seen as a political fix for parties which find it
hard to win first-past-the-post elections. It is a new way of doing politics
which seeks to construct government out of a plurality of interests, and
within which policies will be agreed by negotiation rather than fiat.
Such sentiments would not be unusual coming from a German or a Dutch
politician. From a practising British politician in the official - if
emasculated - opposition, it is a remarkable admission.

subsidiarity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SUBSIDIARITY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
by Andrew Duff (editor)
Federal Trust, Pounds 17.95 135 pages TX;For subsidiarity read federalism.
They are the same thing: the principle of separating constitutional
authority between different territorial tiers of government.
We are lumbered with subsidiarity because Britain's Tories cannot abide the
'f' word. And because Jacques Delors, ever shrewd, seized on a term which
not only avoided the word 'federalism', but appeared to denote a more
sophisticated concept.
In reality, subsidiarity's sole concern is the balance of power between the
European Union and its 12 nation states. The Union is already a federation,
albeit an unusually weak one. It has a constitution, an executive, a
bureaucracy, a judicial power, and a legislative power (divided,
confusingly, between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers).
Yet there is nothing sophisticated about the way subsidiarity regulates the
balance between the Union and the States. The Treaty of Maastricht says,
simply, that Union intervention is 'in accordance with the principle of
subsidiarity' if its objectives 'cannot be sufficiently achieved by the
member states', so long as they can nonetheless be achieved by the Union 'by
reason of the scale or the effects'. Which means precisely what the beholder
wants it to mean. 'Sufficiently' and 'scale or effects' are not defined;
while the potential fields of Union action laid out Maastricht are broad and
largely unfenced by anything except subsidiarity.
As Andrew Duff puts it in his introductory chapter to the Federal Trust's
excellent symposium on the subject: 'subsidiarity means that important
powers - for example citizenship, the internal market, external trade,
competition policy, the protection of the environment, the control of money,
and, ultimately, defence policy - can be logically transferred to a federal
government at the European level'.
In other words subsidiarity is a political, not an objective, principle. It
allows Europe's politicians to organise the relationship between the Union's
upper tiers of government as they think necessary, provided they can secure
a minimal level of public support for their arrangements - which is all they
ever got to push through Maastricht. Two centuries hence, Maastricht's
Article 3b might be regarded as the all-purpose instrument for extending the
authority of the Union, much as the 'inter-state commerce' clause was for
the development of the federal tier of US government.
So, far from being closed by Maastricht, the debate about subsidiarity has
barely begun. It will be invoked every time the future of the EU comes up;
and by enshrining a flexible definition of federalism in the European
Constitution, it is likely to make it relatively easy for the Union to adapt
to changing agendas.
Whatever lies in the distant future, a United States of Europe is not around
the corner. In any political system, the paymaster is king: at Pounds 55bn,
this year's European budget would barely foot Britain's social security
bill. Nonetheless, there is legitimate concern, largely unreflected in this
volume, about subsidiarity as a constitutional principle.
The problem is that it is at once too vague, while offering the pretence of
an objective formula for a process - the allocation of powers between
different tiers of government - that is essentially subjective. Any
formulation intended at the outset to mean all things to all people is a
poor principle to guide a constitution.
With a fair wind, it may work. But constitutions should be designed for the
storm, not the calm. Most of the contributors to this volume too glibly
assume that federalism is a superior system for a democratic Europe than a
patchwork of independent states.
Alas, history is more ambiguous. For every federation that has succeeded,
there is one that has failed (Czechoslovakia), one where a sense of common
identity has weakened (Canada), and one which has only been sustained by
civil war (the US). If the EU is to survive, it will not be at the hands of
constitutional witch doctors peddling subsidiarity.

THE HOLLOW CORE: PRIVATE INTERESTS IN NATIONAL POLICY MAKING
by John Heinz, Edward Laumann, Robert Nelson, Robert Salisbury
Harvard University Press, Pounds 31.95 450 pages
This book addresses the role of lobbyists in government, and the interaction
between business and the governing process, in the US context.
The number of registered lobbyists in Washington has increased from 3,000 in
1965 to nearly 25,000 today, and the number of major corporations operating
DC offices has risen from 50 in 1961 to almost 1,000 now. This lobbying
explosion has produced a rash of academic and journalistic comment, most of
which effectively argues that lobbyists are now 'The Third House of
Congress', or even the most dominant.
Hollow Core is by far the most comprehensive (to the point of overkill)
survey yet of the Washington lobbyists' life and work. It is not easy to
read. The monumental scale of the research perhaps renders that inevitable,
but the authors' decision to place large chunks of their mathematical
methodology within the body of the text, rather than in appendixes marked
'for statistics freaks only', is regrettable given that often what the book
does is provide confirmation of what intuitive common sense suggests anyway.
This means that on those occasions where the methodology provides
ground-breaking material, the reader may be too confused to appreciate the
significance of the discoveries. If this means that the book is read more in
specialist academic circles than the wider corporate community, it would be
a pity.
The essence of the book is interviews with 776 Washington
representatives/lobbyists in four major domestic policy arenas -
agriculture, energy, health, and labour - conducted in 1982 and 1983,
supplemented by further interviews and questionnaires aimed at the bodies
which hire the lobbyists (frequently business) and the government officials
(congressional and/or executive) who the lobbyists approach. Added to this
is an analysis of policy initiatives in the four domains during the
1977-1982 period.
From this admirably deep range a much more complete and credible analysis
about the way modern Washington works emerges than in so many previous
accounts. Dozens of important observations are made. Many confirm existing
assumptions that there is a strong correlation between the number of notable
contacts a lobbyist has and the fee they command; and that a specific
background in the (especially congressional) body one is lobbying appears
related to final success.
Other findings test popular wisdom. Most lobbyists are policy specialists,
not freelance 'hired guns' who work on any side for a fee. A great deal of
their work is not advocacy but simply monitoring and highlighting government
activity, and its potential implications, for their clients.
The central thesis is that there is 'little evidence to suggest that a
powerful role is played by intermediaries - by more or less autonomous
actors who are able to use their personal influence to promote compromise or
impose settlements.' In other words, it is not true that lobbyists are at
the policy-brokering centre of modern Washington politics.
That is the good news. The bad news is the finding that nobody else occupies
that central position either. The authors portray a governmental system
engaged in continual activity but beset by endemic uncertainty and making a
fundamentally incrementalist impact on public policy.
The authors argue that the absence of such mediating institutions represents
'hollow cores' in American domestic politics which go a long way to
explaining the extraordinarily turbulent system of the last two decades.
One suspects that many of those who entered the Clinton administration at
the beginning of this year might say 'Amen'. The reality of this mass market
of uncertainty for business is that more and more corporations may feel
obliged to create or build-up their own influence-generating efforts to try
and best position themselves. The lobbying industry will be the beneficiary.

INTRODUCTION TO STOCK EXCHANGE INVESTMENT
by Janette Rutterford (2nd edition)
Macmillan,Pounds 45/Pounds 15.99
Investment books fall into one of two categories. First, there are the basic
primers, which skim across the spectrum acquainting the reader with stock
market concepts and proffering practical advice. Then there are the more
sophisticated investment manuals, crammed with mathematical formulae and
arcane theory. Introduction to Stock Exchange Investment is one of the few
books which usefully bridge the gap.
The title of the book, though, is somewhat misleading. As Rutterford makes
clear, her book is aimed at final-year business students. A general reader
will find much of interest, but be warned: the book does presuppose a fair
degree of knowledge about stock market functions and terminology.
The book is divided into three parts. The first concerns the attractions and
pitfalls of various classes of assets. Equities, futures, and options are
covered in detail as the author delves into such delights as straddle
options and hedge ratios. The second part, on investment strategy, discusses
portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model and efficient markets.
This contains much interesting argument, although the text is heavy going.
The third part consists of a straightforward overview of international
investment opportunities and the investing institutions.
Although it has been updated for the second edition, a few anachronisms
remain. Some are minor: Hanson Trust is no longer named as such, for
example. Others are more serious: some of the FT charts and tables sprinkled
through the text are already out of date.
The book is written as a textbook and, at times, reads like one. There are
few examples drawn from real life to enliven the prose. It lacks the verve
of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, which covers similar ground in a far more
relaxed style. But those wishing to broaden their understanding of the
practice and principles of investment will consult it with profit.

ETHICS AND MARKETS: CO-OPERATION AND COMPETITION WITHIN CAPITALIST ECONOMIES
by Colin Crouch and David Marquand (editors)
Political Quarterly/Blackwells,Pounds 11.99 156 pages
The Cold War and communism are over, but the debate over the morality of
capitalism continues. That is the message of this volume of essays, whose
authors are almost uniformly driven by a distaste of capitalism - in its
Anglo-American form, at least.
The distaste is partly a moral one. The authors, who mostly come from the
centre-left of British politics, do not like the way that free markets
produce losers as well as winners. But they also argue that Anglo-American
capitalism, with its stress on competition rather than co-operation, is not
a good way of generating wealth by comparison with the German or Japanese
versions of capitalism.
Their critique of Anglo-American capitalism, though hardly new, has the
advantage of combining 10 authors' perspectives in 150 pages. The heart of
the critique is that long-term relationships cannot develop and flourish in
nakedly competitive markets. What is needed is a culture of community,
co-operation and trust.
The authors argue that the alleged short-termism of the Anglo-American model
is most damaging in three respects. First, the failure to develop long-term
relationships between companies and their shareholders undermines long-term
investment and opens the way for practices such as hostile takeovers and
asset-stripping. Second, the hire-and-fire mentality in the labour market
discourages investment in skills. Third, the fact that manufacturers often
have little compunction about switching suppliers if they can get a better
deal prevents the growth of long-term links between manufacturers and
suppliers.
What all this has to do with ethics? The answer is, in part, that such
long-term relationships have characteristics - trust, loyalty, cooperation
and the like - normally associated with ethical behaviour. But the answer is
also that the practices characteristic of German and Japanese capitalism are
themselves embedded in those nation's broader cultural inheritances.
These cultural linkages are explored in several papers: Ronald Dore's on
Japan; Colin Crouch's on Germany; and Jonathan Boswell's on the links
between Catholicism, Christian Democracy and capitalism in continental
European countries. All three are interesting. But while Dore's and Crouch's
articles are succinct and accessible, Boswell's is hard work.
There is much in the arguments expressed in this volume. Markets do not
exist in a vacuum. They are social institutions and rely on wider cultural
support to function effectively. To appreciate this point, which was
recognised by Adam Smith, one has only to look at the difficulties in
establishing markets in Russia, where the sanctity of contract has no
tradition.
It is also true that markets cannot be divorced from ethical considerations.
Managers, employees, consumers, shareholders and bankers are all human and
their actions are capable of being judged from a moral standpoint. It is not
enough of a justification to say that their actions are designed to maximise
profits.
However, in three ways, the arguments in this volume are deficient. First,
it is misleading to paint capitalism as merely about maximising profits.
Capitalism is a practice with its own entrepreneurial spirit, which values
risk-taking and the creation of value in the widest sense as well as more
narrow profit-making. While Russell Keat, in his paper, acknowledges that
capitalism may be such a practice, these essays in general do not show much
enthusiasm for the dynamic aspects of capitalism.
Second, it is not clear that the Anglo-American model of capitalism has
failed. The recent soul-searching in continental Europe over whether their
markets are too rigid certainly should give pause for thought. While
competitive markets may not be as good in fostering long-term relationships
as co-operative institutions, they may be more flexible in responding to
changing opportunities.
Finally, even if the Japanese and German model of capitalism were superior,
it could not just be grafted on to the British psyche. While several authors
acknowledge this point, there is little exploration of how one could bring
about such a change. That perhaps is material for a second volume.

THE STREETWISE INVESTOR
by Charles L. Fahy
Probus Pounds 21.50 198 pages
Charles Fahy, the host of the Texas TV show Money Talks and one of America's
most successful stockbrokers, has written a concise, down-to-earth,
investment guide. The Streetwise Investor (a Fortune book club selection) is
perfect for all those forty-somethings trying to figure out their savings
and retirement schemes.
Fahy's basic premise is that people should buy stocks and hold on to them.
'I have a simple formula for those who want to get rich,' he writes. 'First,
earn enough money to be able to save some. With that money, buy stocks.
Second, don't sell or trade stocks unless you are a real pro - and you
probably aren't - so just leave them alone. Continue buying stocks and 20
years out, you will be rich.'
Investors flunk this simple programme, says Mr Fahy, because 'human nature'
makes us want to get rid of stocks as soon as they fail to perform well.
Fahy tells us to diversify, distrust financial forecasts, and to use Single
Premium Deferred Annuities (SPDAs), 'the single smartest, safest, and
easiest accumulation investment product.'
He cites evidence to support this and offers tips on choosing investment
advisers and protecting money once it is earned.
One problem with the book: Fahy hates bonds and spends two chapters
assailing them. But surely bonds, which have outperformed equities this
year, have a place in any sensible portfolio?
Fahy's antipathy is okay if you're as rich as he is, but would you really
want your pension manager to put everything into stocks?
Still, if you follow the eight-step plan on page 178, you stand to earn a
lot more than the Pounds 21.50 cover price.

THE NEW PENGUIN GUIDE TO PERSONAL FINANCE, 1993/4 EDITION
by Alison Mitchell
Penguin Pounds 9.99 370 pages
INVESTORS CHRONICLE BEGINNERS' GUIDE TO INVESTMENT, 2nd EDITION
by Bernard Gray
Century Business Pounds 12.99 433 pages
The British retain a more sheepish attitude to money than their American
cousins. Talking about money is still seen as rather parvenu; wanting to be
rich is an ambition best kept to oneself. The difference is particularly
marked when it comes to books on personal finance and investment. The
Americans lap up books on the subject with titles such as How to Get Rich in
10 Easy Lessons; books by fund managers such as Peter Lynch can become
best-sellers.
In Britain, books in the field tend to be less flamboyant. Often they are
manuals, which work their way methodically through the subject matter, with
one chapter on pensions, another on mortgages and so on.
Two of the best examples of the genre have just appeared in updated
editions. Alison Mitchell's Guide to Personal Finance is written in a common
sense, chatty style. Sentences are nice and short; jargon is kept to a
minimum and explained properly where it does occur; there are plenty of
lists and tips to break up the text. Such advice as is given seems sound (or
at least coincides with this writer's prejudices).
I could only spot the odd mistake, such as the assertion on page 40 that
'income tax at 25 per cent is automatically deducted from all dividends
before they are paid to you.' Since the correct information (that tax is now
deducted at 20 per cent) is given later in the book, it does not really
matter. In any case, personal finance involves such a mass of detail that it
is probably beyond the wit of mortal man or woman to produce a book on the
subject without at least one error.
Mitchell's book covers such a wide field that it is only for dipping into,
rather than reading in full. The Beginners Guide to Investment by Bernard
Gray (now an FT journalist) is more precisely targeted at the individual who
wants to know more about investment. There can be few private investors who
would not reap some benefit if they read it from cover to cover.
The second edition still includes such useful features as a list of
stockbrokers; it has also expanded its coverage on Peps and Tessas. Most
usefully, given the current surge of interest in equities and some recent
corporate disasters, the book has revised its section on interpreting
company accounts in the wake of recent changes in accounting practice.
Unlike their American equivalents, these books do not claim to be able to
make you rich. But in their modest British way, they should help prevent
anyone who reads them from becoming poor.

THE COST OF TALENT: HOW EXECUTIVES AND PROFESSIONALS ARE PAID AND HOW IT
AFFECTS AMERICA
By Derek Bok
Free Press Dollars 22.95 342 pages
This book is unlikely to get a mention in those seasonal newspaper articles
about what top business people will be reading over Christmas. More's the
pity.
Senior executives on both sides of the Atlantic are no doubt sick of being
lectured on the excessive size of their compensation packages. But they
cannot accuse Derek Bok of mindless envy - the weakness of some critics -
nor of approaching his subject exclusively from the corporate governance
perspective
While institutional shareholders, remuneration consultants and business
academics continue their struggle to link pay to performance, the former
president of Harvard University and dean of the Harvard Law School has taken
a much wider sweep.
Bok's themes include analysis of why some people are rewarded better than
others, the history of executive and professional pay in the US, and the
motivation effect of big money. The fundamental thesis is that the vast
rewards and incentives enjoyed by America's top medical specialists, Wall
Street's elite law firms, and leading business managers is diverting
badly-needed talent from the nation's schools, universities and public
administration. Society, in other words, is the main loser.
Bok is an unashamed moralist. As he states near the beginning of the book:
'The most vexing moral question is why so many people fortunate enough to
hold the most interesting, prestigious jobs . . . should earn many times the
pay of those condemned to work that is much more boring and disagreeable.'
This idea crops up time and again, the message being that there is no
satisfactory justification. The rise of the professions indeed has been a
recent phenomenon, as evidenced by the fact that doctors in 1900 were paid
only half as much as university professors and less even than Federal
officials.
Increasingly strict entry requirements in law and medicine later limited the
numbers joining those professions - with a beneficial impact on their
members' incomes. Teachers and academics, however, could not control supply
in the same way.
The key to rising executive salaries, Bok argues, lay not in limiting access
but in gaining control of the corporation. So long as owners remained in
charge and hired professional managers to run their companies salaries were
ample but not extravagant. JP Morgan made a point of not paying any
executive more than 20 times the earnings of the lowliest employee in an
organisation.
Once professional managers became accountable to ill co-ordinated armies of
small shareholders, however, the way became 'clear to granting emoluments on
the lavish scale we know today'. In the 1920s - a time of booming markets in
the US - a few chief executives like Charles Schwab of US Steel, Eugene
Grace of Bethlehem, and George Washington Hill of American Tobacco received
bonuses in the good years that lifted their total pay above Dollars 1m (or
roughly Dollars 8m in today's currency).
Bok usefully exposes what he euphemistically calls the 'special
characteristics' of the market for private sector professionals. He points
out that while limiting supply helped boost incomes earlier in the century,
doctors and lawyers have continued to prosper in the last couple of decades
despite intensifying competition and rapidly expanding professional numbers.
This is partly explained by the value of professional reputations, which
allow those which have them to gain advantages over those who do not but who
may have equal abilities. Price pressure and negotiation, moreover, is often
absent because the cost of hiring, say, the best lawyer is a tiny part of
any corporation's overall budget. Doctors are often paid according to an
official scale of fees.
Bok is also good at refuting apologists for high pay, knocking down
arguments that huge rewards can be justified when compensation fluctuates
wildly from year to year (mostly it does not), that the sums involved are
trivial for the country as a whole (no longer the case), and that the
wealthy invest their fortunes wisely and imaginatively for the good of
society (generally not true).
His most controversial contention, though, is that sky-high pay packages
have at least partially been responsible for the shift of able students away
from careers in the public sector to careers in the private sectors. It is a
not unfamiliar lament, but as you would expect from someone in his position
the argument is backed up with exam scores and analysis of Phi Beta Kappa
graduates.

<TEXT>
KEYNES FOR BEGINNERS
by Peter Pugh and Chris Garratt
Icon Books, Pounds 7.99 174 pages
KEYNES is back. Recessions in Germany, Japan and across Europe, sluggish
recoveries in the US and Britain and disillusionment with monetarist
orthodoxy after the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism have
all helped restore faith in a 'Keynesian' response to recession.
At the root of this revival is a renewed belief that government action is
needed in order to revive depressed economies. But only Japan can be said to
have taken a traditional Keynesian 'pump-priming' response. In the US,
persisting fiscal difficulties combined with heavy private sector debts have
meant that monetary policy has been the main weapon of counter-cyclical
policy.
What would Keynes himself have thought of this new-style activism? For the
causal reader, going back to the often obscure and contradictory works of
the great man himself is unlikely to provide an answer. Nor is the busy
Business Books reader likely to have the time to wade through Lord
Skidelsky's magnificent two-volume biography.
Let me make a suggestion. For those who want a quick flavour of Keynes'
writings, in historical context, with lots of pictures and who are not too
worried about detailed scholarly interpretation, Keynes for Beginners is
perfect. The book traces the history of Keynes' life and thought from his
birth in 1883, through the first world war and Keynes' critique of the
Versailles treaty, the return to the Gold Standard and depression of the
inter-war years, the General Theory of 1936, the second world war and
Keynes' role in establishing the Bretton Woods system, his death in 1946 and
the rise and fall of post-war Keynesianism.
What makes the book novel is its use of illustration and character. Each
page contains just a paragraph of commentary, with the bulk of the analysis
spoken through the mouths of Keynes himself plus a host of characters,
ranging from Adam Smith and Karl Marx, through Adolf Hitler to Margaret
Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The illustrations are clever, often funny, but
the text is serious and well researched.
Particularly welcome is the contemporary commentary. A rueful John Major
pops up regularly during Keynes denouncement of sterling's disastrous return
to Gold in 1926 at a horribly overvalued rate and subsequent exit. 'Sounds
like the European Community's exchange rate mechanism that we abandoned in
1992]' comments Major. 'I wonder what Keynes would have though of the ERM?'
asks Norman Lamont. 'I give you one guess]' replies Keynes.

HOW TO GET AHEAD IN BUSINESS
by Tom Cannon (editor)
Virgin Books, Pounds 9.99 260 pages
This is an instant book. Its very existence proves what tightly-focused
management can achieve when objectives are simple and clear. With hard work,
and a team from Virgin Books frantically getting permissions to publish
extracts of others' works, you can have copy ready for the printer in 31
days, which is what Tom Cannon did this summer.
The rush arose because Virgin accidentally created the book's market. Last
summer the airline ran a teasing TV advertising campaign featuring
celebrities, including Branson himself, reading a book called How to Get
Ahead in Business. The answer, the second half of the campaign, was supposed
to be 'Fly Virgin'.
The book was a dummy and only there to make viewers ask the question. But
many of them - Branson says thousands - started asking for the book instead.
Virgin decided to publish one, but it had to be done quickly to match and
catch the campaign. Cannon, an erstwhile director of Manchester Business
School who was consulting for Virgin, seized the opportunity.
The book is great fun. It even provides some valuable clues on how to get
ahead in businesses. Cannon is an irrepressible scouser who proved a little
too entrepreneurial and independent for Manchester University last year. The
flavour of Cannon - and why there are often clashes between practical
management educators and the differently-driven, meticulous academics who
distrust his like - comes over.
As with any anthology, the general thrust comes from the selection and the
way the constituent parts are linked by display, classification, headlines
and juxtaposition. As with any anthology, the problem is maintaining it.
Cannon does it in 14 chapters, using 84 main sources and a liberal
sprinkling of jokes, aphorisms and cartoons so as to achieve some element of
surprise and delight on nearly every page. This is a book for dipping into,
but also one for learning from - and for sampling works some may feel worth
deeper study.
The rush to publish shows. The reader is left to guess that the passages in
italics are a linking commentary by Cannon himself. But its substance and
thrust are strong enough to overcome this. Generally the theme seems to be:
analyse, keep it simple, communicate well, get on with it, re-evaluate,
deter bureaucracy, fight fossilisation, innovate and learn from your
mistakes.
Authors range from Machiavelli to Mark McCormack, from Stephen Potter to
Parkinson and Peters, from Rudyard Kipling and Tom Wolfe to Philip Kotler
and Theodore Levitt, from Aristotle to Peter Drucker. One-liners from Heller
('The first myth of management is that it exists') or Launegayer ('Asking
dumb questions is easier than correcting dumb mistakes') join the laws of
Murphy and Finagle to let both insight and typographical light into the
text, increasing readability.

THE EUROPEAN CURRENCY CRISIS
by Paul Temperton (editor)

Economically, Paul Temperton points out in his extended introduction to this
volume of collected contributions on the trials of the European Monetary
System, Europe is not a good candidate for a monetary union. Without
effective mobility of labour across borders, and with wages notoriously
inflexible within them, monetary union would create enormous regional
problems. The cost of buying and selling a house ranges between 12 and 22
per cent of the price in France, Italy, Germany and Belgium compared with 9
per cent in the US.
Sir Alan Walters discusses his eponymous 'Walters critique' of the ERM, that
pegging currencies forced governments into perverse domestic monetary
policies: an attempt to run high interest rates to counter high inflation
and monetary growth would invite a deluge of foreign inflows, refuelling
monetary expansion. An ERM-type structure, with fixed but adjustable rates,
is only at best able to offer a knife-edge equilibrium, being inherently
unstable.
With absolutely fixed rates, Walters adds, this would not apply because
domestic monetary policies would have to be surrendered, presumably to the
Bundesbank. Tim Congdon develops this analysis by considering the
differences between domestic monetary frameworks, which meant for example
that in the late 1980s the same interest rates in the UK and Germany led to
a far higher rate of monetary growth in the UK (mainly because of the impact
of the housing market). The ERM was simply incompatible with national
differences in institutional structures and in tax incentives, and
politicians had thought little about the consequences of this.
This book, produced in collaboration with the bond commission of the
European Federation of Financial Analysts' Societies, was originally the
victim of bad timing. The deadline for contributions was last June but the
second ERM crisis, which reached its climax at the beginning of August,
torpedoed its ambitions. However, the publishers managed to capitalise on
the crisis by asking contributors for updates and delaying the publication
date. There was a reasonable degree of co-operation except from the Banque
de France which 'could not provide a contribution which reflected the recent
change in circumstances' and is therefore the only major EU central bank not
to be represented with its own chapter.
Some bitter lessons were learned in August. EU governments were made to
realise that their foreign exchange reserves of some Dollars 275bn counted
for little against global asset portfolios running to trillions and regular
foreign exchange turnover of Dollars 1 trillion per day. There is talk of
the reimposition of capital market controls, but Congdon points out that it
would be an ironic and unsatisfactory outcome if, on the supposed road to
monetary union, EU member states were forced to separate their capital
markets and banking systems.
Although inevitably already a little out of date, this book provides a
varied and expert analysis of the fault lines within the ERM. There are 10
independently contributed chapters on the ERM, the Maastricht Treaty and
central bank independence, and a dozen perspectives from European central
banks, some of which include blow-by-blow accounts of days of crisis.
The latest central bank thinking, judging by recent statements from the
heads of the Bundesbank and the Bank of England, is that member states must
refocus directly on long- term economic convergence and not try to
re-establish the ERM in its old form. Whether this represents the practical
way forward, or simply reflects an attempt by central bankers to push the
problem back to the politicians, is arguable: the desire to converge is much
stronger in some EU member states than others. At any rate, central bankers
have no desire to man any more barricades.

THE POST-WAR HISTORY OF THE LONDON STOCK MARKET 1945-92
by George G. Blakey
Mercury Business Books Pounds 19.95 364 pages
In 1947 you could have invested directly in Glaxo for the first time, when
the baby food and penicillin maker became listed through the restructuring
of a group called Joseph Nathan. Alternatively you could have put your money
in the established giants of the time, including Swan Hunter, Morris Motors
or Dunlop, all prominent constituents of the FT 30-Share Index at the time.
You would have done vastly better in Glaxo, but you might never have known
it at the time.
George Blakey's entertaining history of the London stock market over nearly
50 years fills a gap, and appears just in time to solve some Christmas
present problems for the families of mature investors.
The author mostly ignores dry statistics and instead concentrates on
highlighting the key events and personalities. Such battles as as the
bruising scramble for British Aluminium in 1958 and the failed bid by ICI
for Courtaulds in 1961 are still widely remembered in the City. The
disappearance of the old yield gap between equities and gilts in August 1959
is of particular interest now as investment strategists debate the impact of
the return of inflation to 1950s levels. The agony of 1974 is well
described, but the crash of 1987 - the single most spectacular market event
in this period - possibly rather less so.
Even the company names seem to evoke a distant era: it is hard to imagine a
company these days being called Daintifyt Brassieres, a 1959 bull market
flotation (we have clearer memories of another 1959 listing, Polly Peck). As
for the individual entrepreneurs, George Blakey adds considerable life to
the book by picking out interesting characters and following them through
the years. Many shooting stars burned out quickly but one or two, notably
Lords Weinstock and Hanson, have been around for most of the period
surveyed.
This is the viewpoint of a stockbroker, so readers should not expect
academic theories and elaborate explanations. But the facts will be
fascinating in themselves to anyone who has lived through even a part of the
period. The market has, after all, coped with amazingly contrasting periods.
In the 1940s the government was busy nationalising bus companies, now it is
enthusiastically privatising them.

WEATHERING THE STORM: WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES FROM THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
TO THE FERTILITY DECLINE
by Wally Seccombe
Verso, Pounds 34.95 286 pages
IN 1973, Aldo Brandirali, Secretary of the Italian Marxist-Leninist Party
gave this advice in the party's official sex guidelines: 'Sex without class
consciousness cannot give satisfaction, even if it is repeated until
infinity.' Now, in Wally Seccombe's difficult book on working-class families
and the fertility decline, Weathering The Storm, it is not the sex but the
class consciousness which is infinitely repeated.
Seccombe continues from his Millennium of Family Change: Feudalism to
Capitalism in Western Europe by looking at working-class families from the
19th and early 20th centuries throughout two industrial revolutions. In the
late 19th century, technological improvements coincided with a decline in
birth rates. The book looks at wages, family structures, prosperity and the
relationship between working and living conditions. It is an inquiry of
broad scope and interdisciplinary method; but the effort required outstrips
the rewards gained in reading it.
Seccombe places family activity (reproduction, sustaining, rest) at the
heart of what he calls 'historical materialism's central theoretical
category.' Crudely, if a Marxist historian wants to account for work and
behaviour in the working-class family and at the same time wants to assume
that the labouring classes are defined by the ruling classes, he will need
some notion of how the working-class family evolves itself.
Seccombe has the answer: 'In order to recognise the deeply reciprocal nature
of this equilibration, and to gauge its resilience or vulnerability, we must
eschew structuralist-functionalist models in which the prevailing mode of
production determines, in a full or sufficient sense, the familial
reproduction of its labouring classes.' And he sets off to explore 'the
potential utility of this revised paradigm for Marxist inquiry' throughout
the next 200 pages of theory and abstraction.
In spite of the difficulty of Seccombe's style, the book has a tight logic
which draws out the initial hypotheses into expanded sections. The section
on 'The Fetishism of the Wage Form and the Concealment of Domestic Labour'
has the familiar air of a male professional academic feeling guilty because
one of the pioneers in the area, Marx in this case, was just not feminist
enough.
The disadvantage of Seccombe's method is that, while academically prudent,
he is empirically jumbled, always carrying on a debate with unseen
detractors while at the same time delivering facts and figures which
non-implicated readers would find useful.
The best chapters are the final two, where Seccombe meets his poor
monosyllabic sources face to face. He looks at patterns of earning in the
second industrial revolution (broadly, around 1870 to 1914) when gas,
chemicals and electricity made a technological impact on an England which
had readied itself for change by building the railways in the 1850s. Here
Seccombe has testimony from women managing on meagre resources and committed
to feeding husband and children first.
The last chapter charts the decline of 'proletarian fertility' from 1890 to
1920 by looking at abortion, birth-control and abstinence. Here, Seccombe
draws on collections of letters to The Women's Cooperative Guild and to
Marie Stopes between 1910 and 1920. At this point, the theory slackens its
relentless grip on Seccombe's material, and individual cries of hurt, need,
pain or joy are heard.
This chapter is much more in line with another book in the same social
history series, Franciose Barrett-Ducrocq's fine Love in the Time of
Victoria: Sexuality, Class and Gender in Nineteenth-Century London which
focuses on evidence from hospital and charity archives.

CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Edited by DD Prentice and PRJ Holland
Clarendon Press with Allen &amp; Overy, Pounds 35 225 pages
Adam Smith had particularly trenchant views about joint stock companies.
Shareholders, or 'proprietors' as he called them, seldom pretend to
understand the business they invest in and are content to leave its affairs
to the management. The latter cannot be expected to look after other
people's money as carefully as they would their own. Hence his view that
'negligence and profusion must always prevail.'
The argument is equally valid today, though the views expressed in this book
do not necessarily go so far.
Discussion of corporate governance has loomed large in the UK large since
the publication of the Cadbury report. This book provides some useful
insights. But first a word of warning. The trouble with collections of
essays by different people is that they can make for an overall work of
varying quality. This book falls into the trap with a first chapter of
almost mind-numbing turgidity. It is a pity that more effort was not put
into editing, since those prepared to struggle through to subsequent
chapters will find at least part of the experience rewarding.
There are a number of issues to be addressed, not only the search for some
convergence of interest between owners and managers. It is important to
define who are the real stakeholders are in a company, though the idea that
workers are among them belongs perhaps more to the mainland European
tradition. These issues have to be evaluated against a litany of
contemporary concerns: short-termism, investor protection against fraud, and
shareholder democracy, to name but three.
Who should take on the responsibility for ensuring that corporate governance
is sound? Paul Rutteman of Ernst &amp; Young notes that auditors who do not sit
on board meetings cannot have much insight into the actual effectiveness of
non-executive directors. Paul Davies of Oxford University argues that
institutions do not have much of a record for intervening in the way a
company is run. Their main concern is to maximise returns. Intervening to
change corporate policies risks headlong confrontation with management and
requires collaboration between competing institutions.
Perhaps the banks could play a greater role. They often exercise an
important influence through the covenants in their loan documentation. But
as Theodor Baums of the University of Osnabruck notes, the role of banks is
greater still in Germany, where banks wield enormous influence because they
are both lenders and proxy voters of the stock they hold on behalf of
customers. This gives them control of the supervisory board where the real
power within German companies lies.
Curiously, though, German banks can get too close to companies. To ensure
their loans are repaid they have a natural temptation to encourage companies
to gear down and pay small dividends. Once the links are well-cemented,
however, the relationship can be too cosy. Hence they would be reluctant to
insist on management restructuring.
That may be more of a long-term approach but banks may be too risk-averse as
shareholders. The best answer may be a combination of the German system with
that in the UK where there is a market for corporate control which can exert
some pressure on management. How such a compromise would work is the subject
of another book.

FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): Business books:
business booms - Where can you find that must-have manual? Linda Bilmes
analyses a fast-growing market
</HEADLINE>

Do managers read? Or do they just accumulate the latest business tomes on
their bookshelves?
According to Bob Norton, Head of Information Services at the Institute of
Management and author of The Ten Commandments of Management (Century
Business), 'managers want to read . . . as little as possible.' So what
accounts for the proliferation of new business titles and the big push by
booksellers into the lucrative business book market?
As Norton stresses, most business books are fundamentally boring. Still,
managers want to glean the cleverest new ideas and techniques buried amidst
the tonnage. The trick is to find them, hopefully in advance of your
competitors. For that, you need help.
Fortunately, booksellers have embraced the challenge. In addition to
stocking a wide range of business and economics titles, the sales staff in
the business bookshops are generally first rate, capable of guiding the
business person through the maze of similar-sounding titles. As the table
shows, major booksellers and speciality business bookshops accept credit
card orders over the phone. They will generally deliver books in stock
within two to three days, and can order titles not in stock from the
publisher, generally within two to three weeks.
Most American business books are available in same time frame via their UK
distributor. Books published in the US which do not have a local distributor
can take six to eight weeks, although Books Etc. claims to be able to get
such books within four weeks.
For the bookseller, business books - not just on general management, but
also topics such as time-management, skill-improvement, sales and marketing
and biographies of business tycoons - offer some advantages. They are not
gifts; people buy them all year around, not just at Christmas. Moreover,
these books are expensive, and sold to customers who seem indifferent to
price. 'If somebody wants a book, they don't care if it's Pounds 16.99 or
Pounds 19.99,' says Andrew Meinke, at Dillons Business Bookshop in London.
Many business book purchasers are on expense accounts; in some cases, the
books are tax deductible. UK publishers typically sell a Dollars 16.99
American business book for Pounds 16.99 (Dollars 25). So despite a short
shelf life - most businessmen want the latest book, or the most recent
edition - business books are good business.
But where to get them? The Dillons chain has developed a speciality in the
business book area. Some 40 of its shops nationwide carry a broad selection.
The flagship store is adjacent to London Business School. It has a wide
selection and does a brisk mail order business.
What makes a best-seller? According to Dillons' Mr Meinke, it all depends on
'buzzwords'. This year the key phrase is 're-engineering'. Last year it was
'networking.' Dillons top-sellers this year are John Kay's Foundations of
Corporate Success (Oxford University Press) and Re-engineering the
Corporation by Michael Hammer and James Champy (Nicholas Brealey). 'It's
always haphazard to figure out how well a book will sell,' says Mr Meinke.
'Sometimes you make horrendous mistakes as I did this year by ordering far
too many copies of Silicon Samurai (a book on Japanese IT innovation,
Blackwell).'
In conjunction with major publishers, Dillons prints a 'Business Book
Service' brochure containing brief descriptions of the latest titles. Other
specialist branches include the Dillons Barbican Business Book Centre (at
the Barbican in London) and Dillons Economist Bookshop on Portugal Street,
WC2, near The London School of Economics.
Also pursuing the business books trade is the Books Etc chain. Branches in
the City of London cater for bankers, accountants and lawyers. The
best-selling title at the Broadgate shop is Options, Futures, and Other
Derivative Securities by John Hull (Prentice-Hall). Books Etc. offers free
same-day delivery in the London area. Portia King, manager of the London
Wall shop, puts out an annual business book catalogue listing all current
and upcoming business books, with indices by title and author (next
catalogue available in March 94). They also have a mailing list where you
can tick areas of interest and will send you news of forthcoming titles.
The main UK specialist in business books is Parks, which sells finance,
accounting, and law books, primarily to corporate account customers. Parks
provides same-day hand delivery in London, Manchester, Glasgow, and
Birmingham for a charge of Pounds 1.50 plus VAT. It has a specialised
mailing list. Parks can get hold of anything published in the UK or America
but Europe is a problem. 'People come in and they want books on the German
accounting system,' says Mr Rob Frampton, manager of the Copthall Avenue
branch, 'and it's the devil's own job to get hold of these European
publishers.' So much for the single market.
Waterstones carries a broad spread of business titles in its larger
branches, such as the Leadenhall market store in the City. The chain does
some promotions together with publishers but has no specific service for
business books. Telephone order lines seem to be permanently engaged.
Chances are, if you can't find it elsewhere, Blackwells will have it.
Blackwells, which does some 60 per cent of its business by mail order,
stocks over 8,000 titles just in management, not counting thousands more in
international trade, economics, computing and related disciplines. The main
shop in Oxford has an impressive selection of business books. Blackwells
also has a mailing list and can send news of upcoming titles in your area of
interest.
Airport terminals, with thousands of business travellers (two-thirds male)
with time to kill, are a natural outlet for business booksellers. Heathrow
can probably create a best seller on its own. Sam Brown, airports book buyer
for W H Smith, which has the concession at three of the Heathrow terminals,
Gatwick North, Manchester, Stanstead, and Birmingham, chooses one business
book for promotion every month. This is given floor-to-ceiling graphic
displays and four or five shelves to promote the title. Business books
account for 10 per cent of W H Smith's turnover at Heathrow. Sam Brown's
best-seller right now is John Harvey-Jones's Making It Happen (Harper
Collins).
If you don't have time to browse through the bookshelves, you can join
Executive World, Britain's business book club. The club offers its 15,000
members an opportunity to buy the best selling business books at a 25 per
cent discount. The deal is the usual upfront offer (three or four books for
around Pounds 5) and then a commitment to purchase at least four in the next
8 months. Executive World puts out a bi-monthly magazine offering a
selection of 50 titles in areas such as communication, negotiation,
efficiency, small business, and general management. 'The title sells the
book,' says James Opie, who runs Executive World. Its number two best seller
is called Perfect CV by American recruitment specialist Tom Jackson.
'Everybody looks for a job at some point or another,' says Opie. 'For Pounds
7.45, after the 25 per cent discount, you can own that book.' Executive
World can be contacted on 0793-512666.
Executive Book Summaries (EBS) is the answer for those who want to keep up
with the business literature but cannot spare the time. Based in Vermont,
EBS publishes synopses of business books. Nearly one-third of it subscribers
are outside North America, including 'just about every country except Iraq,'
says marketing director Rob Carter. Presumably, EBS is a brilliant idea for
non-native English speakers.
EBS reads all the business books published in English every year, working
with the publishers so they can see advance manuscripts and galleys. They
pick the 30 best books for eight-page summaries and write one-page
mini-summaries for 36 others. 'The publishers and the authors are all for
it,' says Carter. 'We act as a screening service to help our subscribers
decide 'these are the books I need to buy'. Its not a replacement, but it
whets their appetite.' EBS also sells, by mail order, the 66 titles
reviewed. An annual subscription costs Dollars 139 (Pounds 92). For more
information ring US 804-453-4062 (Fax 804-453-5062).
A number of publishers specialise in business books, including Oxford
University Press, Nicholas Brealey, Gower, Addison Wesley, Maxwell Macmillan
and McGraw-Hill. The publisher can do a lot to influence prospective
customers. McGraw Hill, one of the largest business book publishers, prints
more than 70 titles per year and is the European distributor for the Harvard
Business School press. Every April it publishes a glossy Business Magazine,
distributed free at bookshops, which features interviews with authors,
excerpts from books, and listings of forthcoming titles.
Also worth noting is Business Age magazine, which publishes one-paragraph
notes on new business books in the back of the magazine. Fortune, Business
Week and Management Today each carry a small number of reviews in each
issue. And, of course, there is always the Financial Times Review of
Business Books.
