FT  29 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: A modest shift from caution to confidence -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market is moving into its first autumn Budget week in a
mood which turned confident last week, on the surface at least. The FT-SE
100 Share Index regained the 3,100 mark as the market made a belated
response to the unexpected cut in UK base rates, and to the better news on
the domestic economy and inflation trends.
Much of the improvement was rooted in the derivatives markets, where a very
modest shift from caution to confidence was enough to propel the December
contract sharply upwards.
Traders believe the new money was coming mainly from overseas funds, for
which the Footsie future is but one of a range of global investment
opportunities. There may have been some contribution from the
newly-established Lloyds investment funds.
Traders believe that one overseas fund was putting about Pounds 250m into UK
equities via derivatives last week. If the new Lloyds funds are indeed
active in UK equities, then a further Pounds 800m or so could be in the
offing.
The question this morning will be whether the upturn in the futures
continues. The December contract has established itself as a highly liquid
and tradeable instrument for investors in a hurry, but this has a downside
potential: money in can become money out very quickly.
Technical pressures played a part in futures at the end of last week. UK
funds, and marketmaking firms, had been inclined to take defensive stances
ahead of the Budget. The appearance of buyers for the futures caught the
locals, or independent traders, on the wrong foot, and their efforts to buy
ahead of the trend merely drove prices yet higher.
All hinges on whether the optimists continue to direct the equity market.
With the Budget rate cut now pre-empted, the UK fund managers have braced
themselves for an uncomfortable Budget, incorporating perhaps Pounds 3bn in
tax rises.
These domestic institutions did not show much sign of changing their minds
last week. Now that there are fears that the Budget may bear down on
consumers, fund managers were beginning to focus on protecting the paper
profits achieved earlier in the year in these sectors.
The run-up to the first of the unified Budget speeches has been
characterised by an unwillingness by investors to take up speculative
positions. The Budget could affect a wide range of investment possibilities
for investors' liking: advance corporation tax, VAT, excise duties, mira,
personal pension schemes.
It's better to lie low, think the managers, and wait for base rates to be
cut again after Mr Kenneth Clarke has returned to his lair.
None of this has discouraged UK equity strategists from their relatively
favourable year-end predictions on the market.
This week could be make or break time for forecasts that the Footsie will
close around 3,200 this year, let alone for those still adding 300 points on
to that figure.

Markets will be keeping a wary eye on the European foreign ministers'
special Gatt meeting on Thursday. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities
commented: 'As the negotiations move into higher gear, there will be a whole
series of special meetings which will probably come out with what looks like
bad news. The good news will be saved for the the end of the process.'
FRANKFURT
German stock market professionals have been winding clients up ahead of
Thursday's Bundesbank meeting which, they say, should bring another cut in
interest rates. This should excite more interest in the banks, already in
the spotlight as their 10-month results reporting season continues after
last week's Commerzbank progress report. Press conferences are scheduled by
BHF Bank on Tuesday, and Dresdner and Bayernhypo on Thursday.
MILAN
The market waits for the pricing of the Credito Italiano privatisation due
by Saturday. The Ferruzzi and Montedison shareholders meetings on Tuesday
and Wednesday are expected to approve the share capital increases and
restructuring plans.
AMSTERDAM
Third-quarter results are due on Thursday from ING, the financial services
group whose shares soared to a record high early last month after the
government sold its near-7 per cent stake.
STOCKHOLM
Nine-month figures come today from Atlas Copco, the tool manufacturing
group. UBS is forecasting a 17 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to SKr875m
from last year's SKr751m.
TOKYO
Further technical selling is expected to depress shares ahead of the
December 10 settlement for stock futures and options. Although the Bank of
Japan last week lowered short-term money market rates, investors will remain
wary of further arbitrage selling and margin unwinding unless the government
expresses its support for share prices.
MADRID
Tomorrow's final deadline for agreement in the social pact negotiations is
expected to remove the uncertainty which has made for a volatile market in
recent weeks.

Japanese government bonds can expect continued support this week from
increases in money market liquidity as the Bank of Japan attempts to stem
deteriorating investor confidence in the financial system.
Worries about the banking system have pushed the leading Nikkei 225 index
down through the psychologically important level of 17,000 for the first
time since March 5. Investors expect further technical selling to depress
the index ahead of the settlement of stock futures and options contracts on
December 10.
Bond investors expect continued efforts by the Bank, which last week
supported the Tokyo market by adding liquidity to the money markets and
allowing short-term interest rates to fall.
Investors will also focus on talks in the upper house over the political
reform bill. Although the bill passed the lower house on November 18, talks
in the upper house look as if they could drag on.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, has indicated that he would resign if
the bill did not pass this year. If the upper house fails to vote on the
bill, decision-making on fiscal stimulus, including an income tax cut, is
likely to be postponed, severely damaging business sentiment.
A spate of economic figures, scheduled to be released on Tuesday, are likely
to confirm further economic weakness.

The consensus among City economists is that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, will announce in tomorrow's Budget tax
increases of amounting to about Pounds 2bn. These would come on top of the
Pounds 6.7bn of increases due to take effect from next April.
The tightening of policy which such a strategy would entail is one reason
why gilts have performed well in the past month, with yields continuing
their downward path of the past year. Another reason is the subdued state of
inflationary pressures in Britain, which many economists believe will
continue for some time.
However, gilts specialists would not like to see Mr Clarke tighten the screw
too much in terms of higher taxation. This could push the economy into a
long period of low activity, which could mean the public sector borrowing
requirement stays high. This would be bad for gilt prices in the long term.
The consensus is that the deficit, set for about Pounds 50bn this financial
year, will fall to about Pounds 40bn in 1994-95. A figure of this order is
likely to be projected by the Treasury tomorrow. In the March Budget, the
Treasury forecasts Pounds 44bn.
On Budget day, the Bank of England announces gilt-edged stock to be sold in
its next auction on December 8. It said on Friday an unspecified amount of
bonds in the maturity range between 2002 and 2006 would go on sale.

The Bund market faces a nervous fortnight. This week and next traders will
be overwhelmed with statistics on the German economy. They include new
orders, unemployment, industrial production and the GDP figure for the third
quarter.
On Thursday, the Bundesbank policy-making council holds its penultimate
meeting of the year. The market has priced in a further generous cut in the
discount this year - but will it come?
Latest inflation data, released last Friday, was good - an annual 3.7 per
cent. This was the fourth month in a row growth had slowed. As Mr Johann
Gaddum, Bundesbank vice-president, hinted last Thursday, this may mean
Germany is over the hump on inflation, pointing to further easing of
monetary policy.
Working against this last week were hard-line speeches from Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, and the fact that the fixed-rate repo, at
6.25 per cent, down four basis points on the previous week, apparently
pointed to a more restrained pace of cuts. Growth in October M3 money supply
was higher than expected.
If the Bundesbank delivers no cut, the Bund market will have to focus all
its hopes on the one remaining council meeting, scheduled for December 16.
This may lead to nervousness in the long end. There may still be nervousness
if the Bundesbank does deliver cuts.

Just how strongly the US economy is growing will become clearer this week,
as the first economic data for November are published.
Since its record low of 5.78 per cent on October 15, the long bond's yield
had climbed to 6.33 per cent by last Monday. In the circumstances, the nine
basis point fall in yield by last Friday, thanks largely to Opec's failure
to agree production limits, marked an important recovery.
The market is braced for either a continuation of, or a slight increase in,
the pace of economic activity in October. Anything which suggests the
economy is moving ahead at a sharply higher level would weaken prices.
Revised third-quarter GDP figures on Wednesday are expected to show a modest
increase on the 2.8 per cent growth rate reported, with most estimates at
between 2.9 per cent and 3.1 per cent. The same day brings the survey of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers for November. The NAPM index,
which jumped to 53.9 in October from 49.8 in September, is projected to rise
to anything from 54-56.5.
Friday's November employment figures will provide the last big test of the
week. Bond market economists expect non-farm payrolls, which grew by 177,000
in October, to show an increase of anything from 175,00-230,000. But just
how much good economic news can the bond market take?

FT  29 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: FRN sector is fashionable again -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The floating-rate note (FRN) market, which has enjoyed a spectacular
recovery over the last two years, is expected to continue to flourish in
1994, especially if forecasts of a rise in US interest rates come true.
Volume of Eurodollar FRN new issues has risen to Dollars 43bn so far this
year from Dollars 25.4bn in the whole of last year. This compares with just
Dollars 4bn in 1991, when the market was still suffering from the
after-affects of a crisis in the perpetual FRN sector in the late 1980s.
The crisis, and the subsequent sell-off, severely dented investor confidence
in the FRN market and caused liquidity to dry up. In addition, the start of
the bull run in the US Treasury market gave investors another reason to
continue to avoid the market.
However, sentiment towards the FRN market has improved substantially over
the past year. Syndicate managers say that one of the main factors has been
a fall in swap spreads against US Treasuries over the past year. This has
limited the number of arbitrage opportunities.
As a result, it has often been difficult for borrowers to issue in the
fixed-rate market and swap the proceeds into a floating rate below the
London interbank offered rate (Libor). Therefore, an increasing number of
borrowers has returned to the FRN market, where attractive funding rates are
available.
At the same time, there has been a rise in demand for FRNs from
institutional and retail investors. Both categories of investor have been
attracted by the yield spread over Libor which the notes offer.
Banks hungry for assets have been keen buyers of FRNs, while FRNs issued by
sovereign borrowers have been bought by central banks. In addition, the low
interest rate environment has increased the attraction of FRNs in the eyes
of retail investors wanting to preserve their income.
Syndicate managers say if US rates do rise next year, as many economists
predict, the investment appeal of FRNs should increase. This in turn should
enable the market's liquidity to continue to improve.
The defensive nature of the notes should provide investors with a greater
degree of capital protection than fixed-rate bonds, when interest rates are
rising.
Since the coupon on the notes is linked to Libor and is re-set every three
months, the coupon will rise in line with yields in the market.
The strong investor demand has contributed to the improvement in the spreads
which borrowers have to pay over Libor. It has also enabled the notes to
perform well in the secondary market.
For example, the spread over Libor on Italy's Dollars 2bn offering of
five-year FRNs has tightened to around 19 basis points from just over 30
basis points at the launch in June.
As well as Italy, Sweden and Denmark have raised relatively large amounts in
the FRN market this year. Syndicate managers say the return of sovereign
borrowers has helped to restore credibility to the market.
'The jumbo issues of this year show that sovereign borrowers are now able to
get decent sub-Libor funding in decent size,' says Mr Tim Skeet, senior
vice-president on the syndicate desk at Kidder Peabody, one of the leading
players in the FRN market.
Syndicate managers believe that spreads will continue to tighten over the
next year, and that sovereign borrowers should be able to raise funds below
Libor minus  1/8 , the benchmark established by Denmark in August when it
raised Dollars 1bn through an offering of four-year FRNs.
The only potential problem looming over the market is a lack of fee
discipline among the investment banks, especially those who are keen to pick
up market share now that FRNs have become fashionable again.
'The market is definitely back, but not to the extent that Commerzbank can
sell notes at Libor plus one basis point,' says one FRN specialist at an
American bank.

FT  29 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Gilt market awaits chancellor's lead -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What would it take in tomorrow's Budget to make the gilt-edged market really
happy?
There has been plenty of speculation about what the Chancellor may or may
not have tucked up his sleeve: but if those in the gilt-edged market could
have their way, there are a few important points on which they would like
some reassurance.
In one respect their prayers have been answered. Last Tuesday, the Bank of
England delivered a half-point interest rate cut, lowering the base rate to
5.5 per cent from 6 per cent. That cut had been priced into the gilt market,
although its timing came as a surprise since many had thought an interest
rate cut was more likely to come in conjunction with the Budget or shortly
afterwards.
Now, while the gilt market would probably like to see a further cut in the
base rate, most economists consider it extremely unlikely that there will be
another cut at the time of the Budget.
However, looking ahead, many in the market believe base rates could fall to
5 per cent by the first quarter of 1994, while Mr Roger Bootle, chief
economist at Midland Global Markets, is putting his money on a 4 per cent
base rate 'at some point next year'.
With the focus temporarily off the base rate, the gilt market will be
listening carefully for what Mr Kenneth Clarke has to say about certain
important figures - namely inflation and the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (PSBR).
The latest inflation figure - for October - came in at a
better-than-expected 1.4 per cent, down from 1.8 per cent in September.
'The market will be looking for confirmation of a low-inflation background
in the Budget speech . . . the inflation figures have been better than
expected recently, and if Mr Clarke thinks this will continue, then gilts
would be delighted,' says one gilt-edged market-maker.
Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities, believes it is vital
for the chancellor to re-emphasise the 1 per cent to 4 per cent range for
the inflation target (for the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments). 'It
would be a huge mistake to be seen to be softening up on this, the
centre-piece of post-ERM policy,' Mr Briscoe says.
As for the other numbers, there has been plenty of talk in the market about
fiscal tightening: estimates range from about Pounds 1bn to about Pounds
4bn.
Mr Ifty Islam, UK economist at Merrill Lynch, argues there is probably a
minimum amount of about Pounds 2bn which would keep the gilt market happy.
'Two billion pounds is a small tightening, but the main thing here is
sentiment so, if the government tightens by less than that, the market will
be disappointed. However, a net tax rise of Pounds 3bn-Pounds 4bn on top of
the Pounds 6.725bn already announced would be taken quite well by the gilt
market,' Mr Islam says.
Overall, however, the market will be looking at the size of the PSBR with a
view to just how much gilt funding the Bank of England will have to conduct
in the remainder of this year and next year.
Most economists expect the chancellor to scale back the original PSBR
forecast for 1993-94 of Pounds 50bn to Pounds 45bn-Pounds 48bn, helped by a
faster-than-expected recovery (which has lifted tax receipts) and lower
debt-servicing costs. The initial reaction to a PSBR of Pounds 50bn was one
of horror, and fear that the gilt market would be swamped with new supply.
With the benefit of hindsight, the reaction was over-done, and the gilt
market has coped well with heavy new supply. It coped so well, that the Bank
has succeeded in funding most of this year's requirement. Even so, 'an
expenditure undershoot would be good news', said Mr Briscoe.
The market will want to see a reduction in the PSBR forecast for 1994-95.
Back in March, a figure of Pounds 44bn was mooted. Now, economists in the
City think it could be closer to Pounds 39bn-Pounds 40bn.
In conjunction with these figures, the market would probably welcome a
clarification on the funding calendar. The Bank has been forced to hold more
frequent gilt auctions in recent months because of the amount of funding
which had to be completed.
However, some gilt specialists feel the time has come to re-think the
procedure, given the low cover ratio at some recent auctions.
'In the last year, auctions and taps have accounted for roughly equal
amounts of funding. While this gives maximum flexibility to the Bank, it
means investors feel no great urge to bid in auctions as it is always
perceived that a tap is just around the corner,' says Mr Briscoe. He
suggests the Bank should consider moving to a system where it holds monthly
auctions at which it sells smaller amounts of several different maturity
stocks, as in France.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Markets: Clarke's first Budget looms out of statistical
fog - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The one near certainty about tomorrow's Budget is that Kenneth Clarke will
put on a confident performance. The chancellor is an effective
parliamentarian who relishes his appearances at the despatch box.
It is equally certain that his confidence will be based on statistics which
in some cases are of doubtful reliability and in others are simply unsound.
Official figures suggest that Britain is experiencing an unusually steady if
unspectacular recovery. But key numbers on trade, industrial production and
national output could be concealing a different picture.
This year has been especially difficult because the introduction of the
European single market has turned the figures on visible trade from one of
the most to the about least reliable indicator.
In October, for example, the Central Statistical Office judged that
Britain's visible trade deficit had been widening for some time. A month
later, its view was that the trend had been narrowing.
However, the chancellor also has problems knowing what is happening at home.
The accompanying graphs from this month's Bank of England bulletin show that
the official perception of the shape of Britain's recovery has changed
substantially since Mr Clarke began Budget preparations.
Britain appeared in the summer to be having an ideal recovery, led by strong
growth in manufacturing output that held out hopes of a greater share of
national production going into exports and investment. The recovery now
seems more akin to previous British upturns based on consumer demand and
growth in services.
According to the Bank, manufacturing output grew in real terms by about 1.5
per cent in the first half of this year compared with an earlier estimate of
2.7 per cent. Meanwhile service sector output, which accounts for 63 per
cent of gross domestic product, is back above its recent peak of early 1990.
Earlier statistics suggested it was half a per cent below.
The changing shape of the recovery partly reflects changes in the price
deflators used to calculate the volume growth of exports and output.
Statisticians, when they calculate the important volume indices that guide
our understanding of the way an economy is developing, do not count every
unit of output. Instead they take figures for the value of industrial
production, retail sales and gross domestic product and deflate them by what
they believe to be the right prices.
The Bank believes the export price figures may have been overestimated. The
latest figures, showing an average 10 per cent year-on-year jump in export
prices to world markets and a 12 per cent rise to non-EC countries, are high
in the light of past experience of sterling devaluations when export prices
rose by only about half the extent of the pound's depreciation.
If the Bank is right, the bottom graph becomes less puzzling. It shows that
Britain's exports as a share of domestic demand in the European Union have
fallen sharply since the beginning of this year.
This is difficult to explain, as exporters seem to be building up market
share outside the EU and still enjoy some improvement in price
competitiveness following sterling's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992.
If export prices have risen less than the CSO figures suggest, manufacturing
output and gross domestic product will have been higher than officially
recorded.
There are also some doubts about domestic prices of manufactured goods. The
Confederation of British Industry says official figures exaggerate the rise
in manufactured goods prices for the home market because they fail to
reflect discounting by factories.
Recent UK third quarter figures, showing falling unemployment, rising
productivity and stagnant manufacturing output, are difficult to reconcile
and could lend support to the idea that output is being under-recorded.
One explanation of the relatively feeble growth of UK manufacturing output
in recent years may be sub-contracting by companies of activities that are
not central to their main line of business.
The provision of a factory's meals by outside caterers rather than workshop
canteens would, for example, lead to a fall in recorded industrial
production and an increase in UK service sector output.
Such a trend may be part of a bigger problem of official statistics failing
to reflect the growth and complexity of the service sector that is affecting
the industrialised economies in general. It has been highlighted in a new
book, 'Statistics for the 21st Century'*, co-authored by Mr Joseph Duncan,
the chief economist and statistician of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the US business
information group.
Mr Duncan points out that the basic data collected to measure economic and
social progress have remained essentially unchanged in spite of dramatic
changes in business practices and the international economy in recent years.
'Nobody would try to launch today's space shuttle using a set of instruments
developed for the old DC-3 aircraft', he says. Yet he contends that
governments, businesses and individuals are measuring and managing the
economy in this way.
The doubts surrounding UK statistics this year may have a silver lining for
Mr Clarke: there is a possibility that Britain has been growing at a faster
rate than official indicators suggest.
But no-one can be content if Britain and other industrial counties are
basing economic decisions of importance for the next century on statistical
methods developed at the time of the DC-3.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Markets: Why Japan isn't a bargain - yet - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Just how much worse does the outlook for Japan have to get before the
pessimism is overdone and the country starts to look like a bargain?
The economic statistics due out this week - unemployment, car registrations,
maybe third-quarter GDP - will provide one answer. But there is also a
simpler, more cynical answer: it depends on when the government starts
buying. The ferocious bear squeeze of summer 1992, instigated to prop up the
banking system and burn the fingers of westerners who believed the market
had further to fall, shows just how rapidly the stock market can move when
the government is determined to push it upwards. Then, the Nikkei index went
from about 14,000 to nearly 19,000 in a matter of weeks.
In the past month, the Nikkei has fallen almost as fast as it rose then. It
closed on Friday at 16,726.4, only 17 per cent higher than its low point of
August 1992.
The speed of the decline owes something to the decision to replace the
225-share index with a more modern Nikkei 300, a move intended to make it
harder to manipulate the index by dealing in the illiquid stocks that formed
a high proportion of its contents. With no reason to hold these stocks,
their price has plunged, driving the index down faster.
Still, that is only part of the story. The broader Topix index has also
fallen - down 15 per cent in the past month - a reflection of the crisis of
confidence that has engulfed the Japanese markets as it has become clear
that the economy has taken a further downward turn.
The underlying economy is certainly suffering: J P Morgan is forecasting
continuing contraction in the Japanese economy until midway through next
year and no better than sluggish growth until at least the end of 1995.
Corporate profits continue to slide. Falling share prices should make
companies look cheap, but the drop in profits keeps price/earnings ratios at
levels well above those in other developed countries. Though companies
continue to stress the need for cost cuts, they have not yet embarked on
wholesale restructuring.
From that point of view, Japan does not yet look like a bargain. Still,
perceptions could change rapidly if the market started to move decisively
upwards, under the stimulus of sustained government-led buying. So when will
the government intervene? And will it work as well this time as it did in
1992?
There are two possible reasons why the government has held back from
propping up the market. One is that it sees no need to as yet: though the
Nikkei is within striking distance of its 1992 lows, the Topix index is
still comfortably above them; it would need to fall another 22 per cent
before it entered last year's danger zone. And last year's intervention had
a specific purpose: to prop up the banks by preserving the value of their
big holdings of securities. For most of this year, with their Basle
capital-adequacy ratios safely met, fear about the banks has lessened.
Perhaps a resurgence of concern about the banks, intensified by last week's
poor results, will again produce a desire to prop them up.
The second possible reason for the government's failure to encourage stock
market support may well be more significant: political paralysis. The new
coalition government may not share the belief of its predecessors in
intervention to prop up financial markets; or tensions between the
bureaucrats and their new political masters may be preventing decisive
action.
If the policy log-jam breaks, government-inspired buying will probably be
able to generate a new rally. As last year, this could be very substantial,
especially if it coincides with further easing of monetary policy and a
fresh commitment to stimulatory fiscal policy in 1994.
It will prove no more sustainable than last year's stock market recovery,
however, until there are clear signs of a double Japanese restructuring: a
shift of the economy towards deregulation and domestic consumption; and a
shift on the part of companies towards profits rather than revenue growth.
One important imminent test of the first of those restructurings will be
public reaction to the secret deal to open part of the rice market to
imports, to be announced - so Japanese newspapers were saying over the
weekend - around December 10.
Trend
Two indicators that financial markets are starting to get above themselves:
a brand-new Ferrari being delivered to an address in the City of London
earlier this month; and the comment of a Swiss banker last week. 'People are
getting greedy,' he said. The investment managers who work for him 'think
they are heroes, when all they are doing is following a trend.'
Indicators
The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, accompanied by a clutch of economic
indicators - German unemployment figures, manufacturing output, and new
orders. The year ahead is stuffed with German elections: including local,
regional, European parliament, presidential and federal parliament
elections, there are 20 due in 1994. Add this much political uncertainty to
the growing belief that 1994 could be a year of further economic
contraction, and further cuts in German interest rates seem inevitable.
Traditionally, Germany only starts to emerge from recession when the yield
curve is positively sloped - that is, when short-term interest rates are
lower than long-term ones. Short-term rates are currently at 6 1/4 per cent,
and long-term rates are nearly half a point lower. So, no recovery in sight
yet.
Will it take a recovery in the German economy to push smaller European
stocks ahead of their larger counterparts? As the chart shows, the relative
outperformance of smaller and medium-sized European shares ended at the
beginning of 1992 and has yet to reappear. The chart is slightly misleading,
however: second-tier British stocks have outperformed their blue-chip
rivals, an effect masked by the relative underperformance of smaller
companies on the continent. The German industrial production and
manufacturing output numbers, due out towards the end of the week, will give
an indication of how Germany's export-oriented manufacturing heartland is
doing. Though the biggest German companies are making heavy weather of their
restructuring, their smaller compatriots do not face the same political
scrutiny and have far less opportunity to delay the moment of decision. If
second-tier German businesses are indeed responding urgently to the economic
pressures they face, their share prices will in time start to respond.
Evidence
From an international investor's viewpoint, the contents of Kenneth Clarke's
UK Budget this week are probably of less importance than the growing
evidence that the Bank of England is acquiring a flavour of autonomy. A
truly independent central bank becomes so because of the attitudes and
expectations of its leaders, the political classes and the electorate, not
because of the nominal powers entrusted to it by law. It is not clear what
the electorate thinks, but the new team at the Bank obviously believes
independence is a state of mind - and the politicians are willing to give
them some room to exercise it.
Deficit
A country with a truly independent central bank - Switzerland - is at last
about to see a return to its traditional low inflation. Though Swiss
inflation was still around 3 1/2 per cent in October, the November figure
should drop to around 2 1/2 per cent and, says Hans Kaufman of Bank Julius
Bar in Zurich, it will drop below 1 1/2 per cent next year.
The growing government deficit has created a peculiar situation: the
government bond issue is yielding 4.14 per cent, while the average yield on
issues from private-sector Swiss corporations is only 4.12 per cent.
That unfavourable spread helps explain the need for Switzerland's new VAT,
approved by the voters yesterday. The shift from a sales tax will help
exporters, such as the pharmaceuticals and engineering companies, and hurt
service businesses, including the banks, which will now have to charge VAT
on their portfolio management services.

FT  29 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Administrators draft a concluding chapter -
Andrew Jack on the final stages of the long drawn out sale of most of the
Maxwell businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be a long epilogue to come, but the administrators to Maxwell
Communication Corporation are drafting a concluding chapter to their magnum
opus following the sale of most of the businesses in the public empire of
the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Creditors to MCC may be able to receive much of the benefit through a
dividend early in the new year, as the proceeds of the sale of the group's
principal businesses in the US trickle through.
Accountants at Price Waterhouse and their advisers will still need perhaps
as long as a decade to finish tracing assets, pursue litigation and unravel
in the most efficient manner a network of 400 MCC companies.
But substantial realisations to creditors will come shortly from the sales
of Official Airline Guide (OAG) to Reed Elsevier in September for Pounds
417m, and of Macmillan to Paramount Communications earlier this month for
Dollars 552.75m (Pounds 371m).
Still outstanding in both cases is the 'pre-packaged' Chapter 11 exit under
US insolvency law which will permit completion of the sale of the companies.
That requires expiry of the 'bar date' on new claims against the Maxwell
businesses from creditors who are not yet identified. For both OAG and
Macmillan, these will have expired in the next few weeks.
Mr Mark Homan, one of the joint administrators and head of insolvency at
Price Waterhouse in London, is confident that his team has done all it can
to find any outstanding liabilities. 'We have identified what the books
reveal; heaven knows what they don't show,' he says.
The presence of a 'bar date' beyond which no new claims will be admitted is
one of the advantages Mr Homan will concede of US over English insolvency
law - where the position is more ambiguous. Another is the presence of a
specialist US bankruptcy court, which he says has helped the speed of the
process.
Against that, the administrators have been forced into a very delicate and
unprecedented process of negotiating a path between the sometimes
contradictory procedures of the two jurisdictions - the result of MCC's
directors filing for protection in New York at the same time as the group
entered administration in London.
If there are no new claims before the bar dates, Mr Homan says: 'That will
leave us free to upstream the money.'
The proceeds will then pass through two intermediate holding companies
before being repatriated to the MCC parent for a distribution.
There are still issues to be finalised over the tax bills on the sales. The
administrators need to take care to ensure they do not liquidate any
companies in the MCC network before taking full advantage of offsetting any
proceeds against tax losses elsewhere in the group.
Mr Homan says he was happy with the way in which OAG and Macmillan were
sold: the former by negotiated settlement as a result of some of the
technical and regulatory difficulties involved; the latter by sealed bids,
which he believes to be highly unusual in a US insolvency. He says
Paramount's offer was significantly above the next highest price to 'make us
feel the process was justified' despite some tensions at the time.
Not all money will go to the unsecured creditors in the group: there are
preferential stockholders in OAG to be paid first, for instance, as well as
mortgage payments to deal with.
There are also professional fees, which he estimates will finally total 3
per cent of realisations. Including lawyers and bankers, the total will run
to Pounds 60m or more. 'I've had incredible value,' he says. 'It's unfair to
criticise such dedicated professionals.'
Some money from sales of the non-US MCC businesses has been retained to fund
existing and future costs. That has included about Pounds 100m from some 20
businesses and 40 properties, leaving just a handful of assets left to sell.
In the US, the only significant remaining asset is Standard Rate &amp; Data, the
advertising industry information service. It remains because it might have
been sold with OAG, since they share a common computer system. In the event,
Reed did not want to buy the company, so it is being marketed separately. It
is likely to raise somewhere in the Dollars 80m-Dollars 100m range. A few
more millions will come from some companies which could have been sold with
Macmillan, such as the Advertising Black Book.
Any remaining proceeds for creditors will come from claims against third
parties. Mr Homan is reluctant to be drawn on the subject, but says: 'We are
considering a claim against the auditors' - Coopers &amp; Lybrand. There may
also be legal action against other professional advisers, and insurance
companies reluctant to pay up.
In addition, Mr Homan says cryptically that he is considering actions to
recover 'not trivial sums' from creditors who may have gained an unfair
advantage above others by transferring assets at undervalue or obtaining
undue preferences.
He says that there may be recoveries in the 'high tens of millions' as a
result of investigations work into tracing money illegally removed from the
group.
The administrators are still running a 1,000-line computer programme to help
determine the value and timing of dividend payments. There may be an
intermediate one in January, or a single larger sum in March once the US
bankruptcy proceedings are complete.
On current estimates of realisations, it is believed that the total is
likely to be around 40p in the pound, towards the upper end of the 22p-43p
range quoted earlier this year before an additional 9p from the proceeds of
any successful litigation.
Meanwhile, Mr Homan is beginning to reflect on the wider lessons to be
learnt from the administration, not least of which is his concern at
arbitrageurs who have traded about half of MCC's debt since its collapse.
He says they often pester his staff in a hungry search for information which
it may not be in the best interests of creditors to reveal.
Since they keep changing, it is difficult to keep them informed. He also
argues that their interests are fundamentally divergent from other creditors
 -often favouring break-up to reconstruction of a business.

per cent to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 12.4m). After the preference dividend,
earnings per stock unit emerged at 5.48p (4.82p).
The recommended final dividend goes up to 3.2p, bringing the total to 4.9p
(4.62p).

FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Dutch publisher pulls out of
battle for Extel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publishing group, has dropped out of the bid battle to take
over London-based Extel Financial, the on-line financial information service
company put up for sale two months ago by its owners, United Newspapers.
VNU had submitted an 'indicative' bid for Extel last month and was believed
to be one of the front-runners. But Mr Joep Brentjens, VNU's chairman, told
Amsterdam's Het Financieele Dagblad newspaper that United Newspapers' asking
price was too high.
Mr Brentjens said VNU recently broke off talks with United Newspapers, but
he declined to reveal the asking price. Dutch newspapers had put VNU's offer
at about Fl 195m (Pounds 68.6m).
'We were very interested in a part of Extel, company information, but the
other activities were less suitable for VNU,' Mr Brentjens was quoted as
saying.
VNU is best known as a publisher of consumer and professional magazines, but
it also owns minority stakes in the Dutch television station RTL4 and
operates several on-line financial and professional information services in
the US, some of which are similar to the services provided by Extel
Financial.
Many of the world's largest information providers have expressed interest in
buying the 121-year old organisation and about 40 potential suitors are
thought to have approached Veronis Suhler, the US investment bank managing
the auction.
Other bidders known to have expressed an interest in the past include FT
Profile, the on-line information service owned by the Financial Times, and
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency.
However, Reuters, the global information company, ruled itself out as a
potential bidder at an early stage.
Extel Financial made an estimated profit of about Pounds 5m on sales of
Pounds 33m last year, but soaked up Pounds 6m in investment in technology.
United Newspapers is expected to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce
borrowings.

Net asset value per capital share of Fulcrum Investment Trust stood at
63.12p at the half year ended October 31, against 48.11p six months earlier
and 34.04p for the comparable period.
However, because of a refinancing which was completed at the end of June
last year, and two new loan facilities in sterling and dollars which were
agreed before the period end, last year's figures were not comparable.
Net revenue amounted to Pounds 497,467 for earnings per income share of
4.43p. A second interim dividend of 1.4p makes a total for the year to date
of 2.8p.

Mr Philip Meeson, chairman, said that although margins remained tight,
increasingly more business was being won throughout the group. This, coupled
with continued attention to costs and overheads, was enabling a resumption
of profit growth.
Trading in the second half continued to be satisfactory.

FT  29 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach pays Pounds 9m for Western
Travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach, the operator of regional bus services, is to buy Western Travel,
another bus company, for Pounds 9.25m, in a deal which brings to three the
number of acquisitions since Stagecoach was floated in April.
To finance the purchase, Stagecoach will issue 3m new shares valued at
Pounds 4.75m, Pounds 4m worth of loan notes and pay Pounds 500,000 in cash.
In addition it will lend Western Travel Pounds 2.1m to part-finance the
payment of a special dividend of Pounds 4.5m to the vendors.
Western Travel made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.86m on turnover of Pounds
33.9m in 1992. It had net assets of Pounds 6.5m at that date. The company
operates 650 buses and employs 1,700 people.
Western Travel takes Stagecoach, which is based in Perth, into three new
geographical areas.
Its C&amp;G subsidiary operates in Cheltenham, Gloucester, Swindon and Stroud;
Midland Red (South) is in Warwick-shire and north Oxfordshire, while Red and
White Services operates in rural South Wales.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Chelsfield flotation to raise Pounds 110m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chelsfield, the private property company led by Mr Elliott Bernerd, is
coming to market through a placing and intermediaries offer likely to value
the group at between Pounds 240m and Pounds 250m.
On this basis the group, founded by Mr Bernerd with Pounds 200,000 of
capital in 1986, will rank as the 12th largest quoted British property
group.
Chelsfield will raise a total of Pounds 110m in new capital, Pounds 50m
through the placing and intermediaries offer and Pounds 45m from existing
shareholders to coincide with the flotation.
At the same time the group, which had fixed assets of Pounds 356m at the end
of June and has current net assets of Pounds 141m, has agreed to acquire a
portfolio of properties from Allied Lyons Pension Fund for Pounds 30.6m, of
which Pounds 15m will be in the form of new shares.
Mr Bernerd, who is expected to retain a 30 per cent stake in the group after
flotation, said yesterday the new money raised 'will enable the company to
continue to enlarge and develop our UK properties and to take advantage of
the opportunities.'
Chelsfield will come to market with a portfolio of wholly-owned UK
properties with a total value of about Pounds 250m and annual rental income
of about Pounds 19m - sufficient to cover existing overheads, interest costs
and forecast dividends.
The group's UK portfolio is notable for the number of income-producing
properties, particularly in central London, with refurbishment and
development potential.
In addition the group holds interests in the Merry Hill shopping centre in
the West Midlands and in Stockley Park, a business park near Heathrow
Airport.
Chelsfield also retains a 60 per cent interest in the Wentworth Golf Club
which it operates.
The issue is sponsored by Hambros Bank and stockbrokers de Zoete &amp; Bevan.
The issue price, which will be based on an existing net asset value of 165p
per share, is due to be announced on December 9.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): Renault plan moves closer to the
altar - Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo's controversial plan to marry its car and truck operations to Renault,
the state-owned French giant, should finally be decided this week by a
handful of Swedish pension funds and insurance companies.
Although the special shareholders' meeting is not until December 7, the
outcome should be clear by the end of the week as key institutions make up
their minds which way to vote.
With 30 per cent of the voting capital already in the bag for Volvo, the
odds are now in favour of the merger winning approval.
But a further twist lies in the intention of Aktiespararna, the small
shareholders' association, to make a legal challenge.
Decisions to watch for are from three insurance companies that earlier
expressed opposition because of their scepticism over French promises.
Trygg-Hansa and SPP, sister insurance companies that hold respectively 1.4
per cent and 4.5 per cent of Volvo's voting capital, are set to announce
their verdicts on Thursday and Friday.
Skandia, with 3.7 per cent, is also likely to decide this week.
Other key players are the pension and investment funds of Sweden's two
leading banks, Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken,
which control 13 per cent of the votes.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Bayer in Dollars 200m drive to expand Chinese presence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, is to invest Dollars
200m (Pounds 134m) in six Chinese enterprises as part of a drive to
establish a comprehensive presence in China.
An umbrella agreement was signed at the weekend in Beijing with the Chinese
Ministry of Chemical Industry and subsidiary agreements with prospective
partners.
Ventures include plastics manufacturing, the production of tanning agents
and dyes, and the packaging of photographic film.
Mr Dieter Becher, a Bayer board member responsible for Asia, announced the
establishment of a holding company in Beijing to oversee Bayer's business in
China, one of the first such foreign holding companies on the mainland.
Mr Becher said: 'Bringing our best technologies here is the best way a
company like Bayer can contribute to the development of an advanced chemical
industry in this country.'
Bayer's announcement follows a visit to China earlier this month by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl aimed at boosting the German business presence.
Agreements signed during the Kohl visit totalled more than Dollars 2bn and
included the sale of six Airbus A340's and a contract for the construction
of an 18-kilometre underground link in Guangzhou.
Bayer's decision to establish a presence in China also reflects growing
competition among chemicals and pharmaceutical companies for a share of a
booming market.
Mr Becher said Bayer's exports to China totalled DM520m (Pounds 206m) in
1992, but 'it would be difficult to increase this on the basis of imports
alone'.
Bayer's umbrella agreement with the Chemical Industry Ministry covers
co-operation in planning and construction of chemical plant, and in
engineering and technology transfer. The German company will also
manufacture Baygon, its well-known insecticide, under licence with the
Huabao Group in Guangdong province. Marketing starts next year.
Projects under consideration include production of pharmaceuticals, and
animal health and crop protection products.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Moment of truth looms for Ferruzzi: Bankers and shareholders
vote on the largest shake-up in Italian corporate history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next 72 hours could be decisive for Italy's Ferruzzi group as bankers
and shareholders gather for a string of meetings to determine its future.
The fate of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company and
Montedison, its main industrial arm, goes much further than a tussle over
debts. Ferfin and its subsidiaries, which include Edison (energy),
Calcestruzzi (cement) and Eridania Beghin-Say (sugar), comprise Italy's
second-biggest private company, with more than 52,000 employees and sales of
L19,900bn last year.
The rescue package prepared by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, and
other big domestic creditors is easily the biggest restructuring in Italian
 -and probably European - corporate history. Ferfin's net debt is now
running at more than L22,600bn (Dollars 13.58bn), while group losses last
year were L1,667bn.
The decisive meeting will come tonight, when the boards of Ferfin and
Montedison gather to assess creditor banks' response to the controversial
rescue plan unveiled by Mediobanca in mid-October.
The scheme involves interest moratoriums, restructuring of borrowings and
the conversion of debt to equity. A few subsidiaries will be sold, others
will go into joint ventures in a package designed to lighten Ferfin's
interest burden, prune costs and concentrate on cash-generating
subsidiaries.
Gaining the banks' approval remains a cliffhanger, however. Although
Ferfin's Italian bank creditors backed the plan early on, foreign
institutions have been less malleable.
The position of foreign banks may appear marginal, as they account for only
a fraction of the group's total borrowings. However, they are in a strong
position as their lending is concentrated on a handful of subsidiaries, such
as Montedison, which has borrowed heavily in the US. Indeed they could
scupper the scheme as they account for almost all the loans to Montedison's
big US-based Himont polyethylene subsidiary, which they could put in
default. Together, the foreign banks, which include Barclays, Citibank,
Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS, are owed L6,500bn.
The past week has brought a detente between Mediobanca and the foreign
creditors. An updated plan has removed a number of contentious issues by
taking some big US operations, such as Montedison USA and Himont, out of the
restructuring.
However, observers will only learn tonight whether the changes have proved
enough. Foreign bankers have welcomed the changes, but stress that it is
impossible to meet the deadline of today.
The stakes are high. Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's tough chairman, who was
brought in by Italian bank creditors after a boardroom shake-up earlier this
year, has threatened to instigate bankruptcy proceedings and even to resign
if he does not receive the support of banks representing at least 80 per
cent of Ferfin's borrowings. The latest Mediobanca letter demands 85 per
cent acceptance.
Mr Rossi's challenges are taken with a pinch of salt by foreign bankers, who
see the moves as part of the war of wills in recent weeks. But few care to
brush off the challenge outright, especially as bankruptcy proceedings in
the slow Italian courts could drag on for a decade.
If enough banks agree to the plan, shareholders' meetings will be held
tomorrow to approve Ferfin's recapitalisation and on Wednesday for
Montedison.
For Ferfin, the plan envisages raising L2,932bn via rights issues and
warrants to buy new shares. The scheme is partly a book-keeping exercise, as
creditor banks will largely be swapping debt for equity. Shareholders will
also be asked to approve issuing a further L2,000bn in new shares and L800bn
in bonds over the next 18 months.
Similar action is in store for Montedison. The rescue plan contains measures
to raise L5,172bn, assuming all warrants are exercised. The board will also
seek approval to raise a further L1,000bn in shares and L500bn of bonds over
the next 18 months.
Even assuming a last-minute compromise is reached with the foreign creditors
and enough banks accept the scheme, many details remain to be clarified.
How Ferfin will pay to maintain a holding in Montedison is one. The
Mediobanca plan envisages Ferfin paying L400bn for new shares. The cash will
come from its own recapitalisation, and from a partial sale of its stake in
Gemina, a big holding company. According to the plan, Ferfin's stake in
Montedison will fall from 49 per cent to 30 per cent.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): Investors hope to strike lucky on
dividend - Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the US coal strike apparently moving towards a settlement, Hanson may
have some good news for its shareholders when it reports annual profits on
Thursday.
The strike cost Hanson Pounds 29m in the third quarter and it predicted it
would cost Pounds 60m-Pounds 80m in the fourth, to the end of September, so
the total cost could be Pounds 100m for the year. Investors are keen to see
a settlement, the only question is what the coal producers will have had to
give to the mineworkers to achieve that.
The market is also hoping for a dividend increase, although forecasts are
for a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.29bn (FRS3 basis) in 1992 to
Pounds 1.05bn-Pounds 1.07bn, and around Pounds 50m less excluding disposal
profits against Pounds 1.09bn. Either way earnings per share will be
significantly lower.
Hanson pays its dividends quarterly, and has paid 2.85p for each of the last
four payments. Some feel an increase is due, perhaps to 3p a quarter, while
others think a rise will not be forthcoming.
Another concern is the level of gearing following the Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds
2.1bn) purchase of Quantum Chemical, which went through on the last day of
the financial year. Gearing could top 80 per cent, depending on provisions
and asset revaluations. Underlying cash flow is not expected to be strong
enough to make a sizeable dent in the debt in the short term.
This explains Hanson's current drive to make disposals. After last week's
two deals worth Pounds 166m, there may be more news. The City will no doubt
read into the disposals something more about Hanson's future strategy. It
may also hope for further hints on management succession following the
recent promotion of Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, to the title of deputy
chairman apparently making him front runner to succeed Lord Hanson when he
retires in 1997.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Satellite network for VW dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientific-Atlanta, the communications technology group, is to provide a
private satellite network for Volkswagen which will eventually link its
dealers all over Europe.
When it is complete the VSAT (very small aperture terminal) network will be
by far the largest in Europe with several thousand terminals.
As many as 300 dealers are to be linked to the network within the next year
mainly in the eastern part of Germany where the telecommunications
infrastructure is poor.
It is believed to be the first example of a manufacturing company, as
opposed to financial services groups, setting up its own VSAT network in
Europe.
The network will handle everything from data communications and broadcast
video for staff training to credit-card verification and the provision of
in-store music. After the links are established with VW dealers in eastern
Germany the network will be expanded to cover dealers in the rest of Germany
and then across Europe.
VSAT networks are common in the US and by the end of last year more than
100,000 terminals had been installed worldwide, adding up to a Dollars 350m
(Pounds 234m) a year business. They are less common in Europe with an
estimated 2,000 terminals in use, mostly in Germany. Apart from financial
services they are mainly used by governments.
In the Volkswagen deal Scientific-Atlanta will be the equipment provider and
V-Crest Systems Europe, a wholly-owned Volkswagen subsidiary will manage the
project.
Scientific-Atlanta claims that VSAT networks can offer 20-30 per cent
discounts on traditional land line communication. Volkswagen says in many
parts of eastern Germany it is impossible to link dealers using a
traditional terrestrial network.
The Atlanta-based company decided to enter the European VSAT market last
year mainly because of the European Union's moves towards deregulation of
telecommunications markets.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): Questions in store on depreciation
 -Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours are circulating that Argyll, the UK's third largest superstore
group, will respond to pressure to depreciate its land and buildings. A 4
per cent depreciation could reduce pre-tax profits by about Pounds 25m. Such
a move would put pressure on other chains to follow suit, seriously denting
balance sheets and earnings. Consensus forecasts for Argyll's interim
pre-tax profits, due on Wednesday, are for an increase of roughly 6 per cent
to Pounds 216m-Pounds 217m.
Grand Metropolitan: A Pounds 175m restructuring charge will reduce pre-tax
profits for the year from Pounds 913m to about Pounds 770m. However,
Thursday's announcement is expected to reveal a brighter picture at the
trading level. IDV, the spirits division, should achieve double digit
profits growth, with some help from currency translation. Another good
performance is forecast for Burger King, and North American food operations
will show recovery.
GEC: The City is anticipating an unspectacular set of interim figures on
Wednesday. The second half should be stronger when the company will have the
benefit of a number of large contracts. Pre-tax profits are expected to be
flat at Pounds 350m-Pounds 360m. A 5 per cent increase in the interim
dividend to 2.81p is forecast.
Bass: The UK brewing, hotels and retail group is expected to report on
Wednesday a 5 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds
473m to about Pounds 495m. Brewing profits are likely to be hit by margin
pressures and bad debt provisions, and pub retailing will feel the effects
of disposals. Improvements should come from Holiday Inn in the US and UK
leisure operations.
Severn Trent: The water company, which reports interims on Thursday, will
draw questioning on the state of Biffa, the waste management group purchased
in 1991. Announcements from other waste service groups, such as Shank &amp;
McEwan, leave little room for optimism. The core water division is not
expected to spring any surprises. Forecasts are for Pounds 140m-Pounds 149m
pre-tax, with most opting for an 8 per cent dividend increase to 7.55p.
International: Dresdner Bank, the second biggest German bank, reporting
10-month figures on Thursday, should benefit from buoyant securities
markets. Also in Germany, Thyssen, the steel and engineering group,
announces annual results amid rumours that it will pass its dividend.
Credito Italiano, Italy's first big bank privatisation, will be priced on
Saturday.

FT  29 NOV 93 / 'I am not a conman, I am a very capable salesman'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Levitt, former chairman of the collapsed Levitt Group, yesterday
emerged after a lunch of hot salt beef and chips from his wife's house in St
John's Wood, London, to express his joy about the 180 hours of community
service given him last week.
'I am absolutely delighted to be free. This is the first day with my family
when we feel a little bit of security. They have got their dad home for
Christmas and I am very pleased to be with them,' he said. In December 1990,
Mr Levitt filed for personal bankruptcy and his financial services group
collapsed with debts of Pounds 34m.
When asked whether the sentence was too lenient - the offence for which he
pleaded guilty carries a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment - he
said the result of the court case spoke for itself.
'If the judge and prosecution thought I should have gone to prison, I guess
that is what would have happened. The judge and prosecution were marvellous.
They are nice people and justice was seen to be done,' he said.
'I am not a conman, I am a very capable salesman,' Mr Levitt added. 'I was
most unlucky to lose a Pounds 150m business.'
Last week, eight days into his Old Bailey trial, Mr Levitt unexpectedly
pleaded guilty to a charge of fraudulent trading. The Serious Fraud Office
had in return agreed not to proceed with 21 other charges, including false
accounting, forgery and obtaining property and services by deception.
Mr Levitt said his probation officer had scheduled a meeting with community
services for tomorrow. 'I will do whatever is required of me. With a strong
heart, I will endeavour to do my best and show my decency to society. I
shall enjoy helping the youth of the country. I shall do more than 180
hours. I have always been very charitable.'
As for the future, he said he was looking at various areas of business. 'You
can be assured I will be back in business.'
Mr Levitt added that he had received a great deal of public support. 'Once
the verdict went in my favour, it was amazing how many friends came out of
the woodwork to say 'Well done Roger'.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / SFO 'knew Levitt would avoid jail' in fraud case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office knew Mr Roger Levitt would not go to jail when it
accepted the offer of a guilty plea by the disgraced financial services
salesman in return for all other charges against him being dropped.
The SFO said on Friday Mr Levitt's sentence of 180 hours of community
service was a matter for the judge. Mr Levitt pleaded guilty to deceiving
Fimbra, the insurance industry regulator, over the collapse of the Levitt
Group with debts of Pounds 34m. Fraudulent trading carries a maximum
seven-year jail term.
Senior sources at the SFO acknowledged yesterday they knew Mr Levitt would
walk free. Its counsel, Mr David Cocks QC, was present in the judge's
chambers on Monday when Mr Justice Laws indicated he did not intend to jail
Mr Levitt.
Mr Cocks then met Mr George Staple, SFO director, who came to the court in
Chancery Lane before the final deal was struck after months of bargaining.
The SFO did not feel at that point, however, it could either protest against
the proposed leniency of the sentence or withdraw its offer to drop other
charges. Privately the SFO is said to be very angry and disenchanted with
the judge's decision.
The SFO had been exploring a plea-bargain deal since May. A series of offers
was made to Mr Levitt in an attempt to obtain his conviction while avoiding
a trial. These were all rejected by Mr Levitt, who wanted a guarantee that
he would not go to prison in return for pleading guilty.
'Levitt drove a very hard bargain and said 'no' to everything until he had
to give away hardly anything at all. At the end of the day, the SFO just
lost its bottle,' said a lawyer closely involved in the case.
The disclosures will add to the controversy over the sentence passed by the
judge on Mr Levitt and the SFO's handling of the high-profile prosecution.
At issue is the pragmatic policy of the SFO, adopted after the failure of
the Blue Arrow fraud trial, of seeking, when appropriate, to avoid trials by
securing suitable convictions through plea-bargaining.
The SFO's resort to plea-bargaining began in May this year after the judge,
having already ordered that the case be split into two trials, ruled much of
the prosecution evidence inadmissible in the first trial.
However, lawyers are still confused over the SFO's decision to mount the
fraudulent trading trial first. The second trial - involving a total of 21
charges including forgery and false accounting - would have lasted five to
six weeks compared with three or four months. No action is to be taken on
these charges which will lie on the file.
The call by some MPs this weekend for the attorney-general to appeal against
Mr Levitt's sentence on the grounds of leniency will prove fruitless. Such
appeals cannot be made in cases where offences, such as fraudulent trading,
can be tried either in a magistrates' court or a Crown Court.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Libyan deals hinge on Lonrho film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho, the international conglomerate, is ready to complete deals worth
hundreds of millions of pounds with Libya if a documentary film shows it to
be innocent of the Lockerbie bombing, Mr Tiny Rowland, the joint chief
executive, said yesterday.
Mr Rowland said Lonrho had set up a Caribbean shell company to finance a
film about the bombing to establish whether Libya was involved in the
destruction of the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, with
the loss of 270 lives.
'The Libyans want to sign deals with Lonrho worth hundreds of millions of
pounds but I have to be sure we are not involved with partners of mass
murder,' he said. 'If the film proves them to be innocent, there will be
enormous potential to sign many deals.'
Mr Rowland said Libya wanted to take a 25 per cent stake in Lonrho's
agricultural business and recently pressed the company to sign new joint
ventures worth around Pounds 150m through the Libyan Arab Finance Company
(Lafico), the main investment vehicle of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan
leader.
But Mr Rowland said: 'I have told them that until we know for sure that they
were not involved in the Lockerbie bombing we cannot do any further deals.'
Mr Rowland rebutted suggestions that his joint chief executive, Mr Dieter
Bock, was not backing the film. 'Mr Bock has fully supported the board in
deciding to make this film,' he said.
Mr Bock, however, is known to be embarrassed by the film and wants Lonrho to
withdraw from further co-operation with Libya.
The film is being funded by Metropole Hotels which is two-thirds owned by
Lonrho and one-third by Lafico.
Mr Rowland said he had been warned by Mr Douglas Hogg, minister for foreign
affairs, that screening of the film, due to be completed by January, could
be in contempt of court. Mr Rowland said he had no intention of showing the
film to the public but added that a copy would be sent to the foreign office
once the documentary was finished.
The issue is expected to be brought up at Lonrho's board meeting on Friday.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Food manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strange forces are fast reshaping the UK's food industry and the stock
market seems confused about what to make of them. For the first time in a
long while, it rates food manufacturers' earnings more highly than those
produced by food retailers. And while the retailers have underperformed the
market by 34 per cent this year, the manufacturers have shown a more modest
11 per cent decline. That would either suggest food retailing stocks have
been oversold or that manufacturers have a lot further to fall. The recent
warning from Northern Foods has only reinforced the latter view.
Yet there are several reasons for the divergence in relative performance.
Retailers were previously rated more highly and have had more room to fall.
But food manufacturers may also prove more defensive. The bigger companies,
such as Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes, have strongly-growing businesses
outside the UK. Moreover, producers have made great efficiency gains in
recent years, largely under the cosh of the retailers.
Nevertheless, big restructuring charges may emerge as a feature of the
manufacturing sector as companies try to drive down costs. US consumer
products companies, such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Philip Morris, have perhaps
set the trend. It will certainly be a brave investor who ventured back into
either food sector at present. Both sectors, though, may find some comfort
from dividend yields touching 4 per cent.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: European chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will take more than marginal capacity cuts to transform the outlook for
Europe's petrochemicals companies. If European producers can agree to close
inefficient plant - they appeared close to a deal last week - capacity
utilisation and profitability should improve. But with BASF's large Antwerp
cracker due to start production, token closures will not suffice. Besides,
the real pain in the current downturn has been caused by weak prices rather
than low utilisation rates.
There seems little hope of a substantial pricing recovery until capacity
elsewhere in the world is brought into line with demand. Higher prices in
Europe would suck in imports, notably from the US. Since US companies are
generally low-cost producers, the flow of imports would be triggered at
prices which would leave most European producers in the red. That cost
disadvantage will not be easily solved. Small European plants using
expensive feedstocks to make plastics in countries with high labour costs
face a long uphill struggle.
Even so, firmer plastics prices combined with higher utilisation rates would
bring mild relief. The worry is that the prospect of subsidies for plant
closures is delaying action that would otherwise be taken on economic
grounds alone. If the talks are going to fail, it is better that they do so
soon.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An agonising couple of days looms for Queens Moat Houses. Today shareholders
meet to approve the 1992 accounts. Tomorrow, bond holders make their first
response to the breach of covenants on the debentures. The controversy over
the group's hotel valuations will loom large in both discussions. Equity
holders are concerned that the latest valuation of only Pounds 861m weakens
their position vis-a-vis the banks. If it is too low, their interests will
be unduly diluted in any eventual debt-equity swap, while the banks will
have an increased share in any future appreciation of the assets.
Coincidentally, a low valuation of the properties is in the interest of the
new management, too. The company's recovery will look more impressive if it
starts from a low base. But that does not necessarily mean shareholders are
being treated unfairly.
First, Pounds 861m may turn out to be nearer the mark than the Pounds 2bn at
which the hotels were valued in 1991. The new valuation promised by the
company may shed some light, but it is a pity that an embarrassed Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors has used the cover of the government
enquiry into other aspects of the case to defer its own adjudication.
Second, the real reason for the restructuring is that the company cannot
generate enough cash to service its debt. Such a situation invariably puts
banks in the driving seat.
Arguably debenture holders face a different kind of choice. By calling in
their security, they might end up with more cash than if they hold on and
renegotiate the terms of their bonds as part of the overall refinancing.
That, of course, would be one way of testing the Pounds 861m valuation. The
risk to bondholders is that hotel sales would then take place at fire-sale
prices, which is not what the valuers envisaged.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Saving in safety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK chancellor's pledge before the CBI conference to conduct a thorough
review of tax on savings might give the pensions industry a stay of
execution. The obvious targets for tomorrow's Budget, such as tax-free lump
sums on retirement and higher rate relief on pension contributions, can
hardly be considered in isolation. For example, restricting relief to the
basic rate of income tax only makes sense if taxation of pensions in payment
is reformed along similar lines.
The drift of policy has been clear since Lord Lawson introduced the cap on
pensions contributions in 1989. With the cap indexed to prices rather than
earnings - and now frozen altogether - the attraction of pensions vis-a-vis
other forms of savings, such as personal equity plans, will gradually
diminish. Mr John Maples, former economic secretary to the Treasury,
recently proposed the logical extension: pension contributions should be
paid out of taxed income but benefits paid tax free, as under a PEP. While
that might initially raise Pounds 7bn a year for the exchequer, the
chancellor would again be guilty of pre-empting a wider review.
The same could be said of another cut in pension funds' tax credit on
dividends. The cut to 20 per cent in March was rationalised as bringing the
credit in line with the new lowest rate of income tax. Unless Mr Clarke
introduces another lower rate, that argument will not wash again. Given the
muted response to the last cut, though, the dividend credit may look a soft
target. Abolishing it altogether might bring in Pounds 2bn, even allowing
for tax relief for companies forced to increase their contributions to top
up pension funds as a result.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The inconvenience of a la carte: Germany hopes France will
yield to gentle persuasion and sign a Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With barely two weeks to go in the Gatt trade negotiations, the moment of
truth is fast approaching for France - for its deeply nervous government,
its unequally matched agricultural and industrial lobbies, its key
relationship with Germany and its vision of the European Union as a power in
the world.
There are signs of movement in the long logjam over agriculture now that the
Clinton administration has lifted its sights from regional to world trade
issues. But Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is still talking very tough. He
is threatening to block a Gatt deal if the US does not produce some speedy
concessions not only in farm trade, but also on steel, textiles and future
world trade rules that would submit Washington to the same disciplines as
others. 'We have obtained nothing of what we have asked for,' he told his
backbenchers last week.
On one thing only, the French prime minister has conceded. After months of
letting his ministers deride Gatt's December 15 deadline as 'an American
date', set to suit Congress, he has acknowledged that, for better or worse,
the middle of next month is decision time. Indeed, he has now cleared the
decks for little else but Gatt, scheduling a parliamentary debate on Gatt
before mid-December and making a trade agreement the focus of bilateral
summits with European partners.
By far the most important of these is the Franco-German summit in Bonn
tomorrow and Wednesday. Leaders of the world's third-largest exporter
(Germany) and fourth-largest exporter (France) will not have any precise
Gatt text to chew on.
But the task before Chancellor Kohl, President Mitterrand and Mr Balladur is
to recast, on a world level, the historic compromise which their countries
made in 1957. This gave French agriculture free run (though on price terms
that protected less efficient German farmers) of the Common Market in return
for opening that market to German industry.
A generation later, the trade-off is more complex. Germany's interests as an
industrial exporter remain constant, while France has become the world's
second-largest food exporter, thanks largely to EU subsidies, and a big
exporter of manufactures and services to the world. The US and the Cairns
group of food exporters are insisting that France commit itself to
sacrificing some of its 12.3 per cent share (at 1991 levels) of the world
cereals market in return for industrial trade gains that are only potential.
Will Chancellor Kohl add his voice to this chorus? President Clinton
apparently requested this in a message passed on by Mr John Major when the
UK prime minister was in Bonn last week.
There is superficial logic in Mr Clinton's desire to bring German influence
to bear on France. Such is the depth of the Franco-German relationship that
Mr Kohl is probably the only person in a position to prevail on Paris. The
two countries are each other's biggest trading and industrial partners;
inside the EU they have produced a joint plan for their economies to
converge; outside the EU each takes few foreign steps without the other;
they have merged part of their armies in the Eurocorps; their civil servants
and young people infest each other's ministries and universities; and so on.
The historic rationale of this relationship, admitted by the leaders of both
Germany and France, has been to bind the Federal Republic into western
Europe. But on the Gatt, the rationale is reversed - it is for Germany to
persuade France not to break ranks with the common commercial policy which
is the European Union's earliest and most lasting achievement.
In the shorter term, Mr Kohl has a tough election year ahead in 1994. He
urgently needs the recovery which German industry is convinced a Gatt
agreement could bring. Inside his coalition government, the foreign and
economic affairs ministries, which lead for Germany on the trade issue, are
headed by pro-Gatt Free Democrats.
But, if one thing is sure, it is that, while Mr Kohl is asking France to
recognise its own and Europe's interest in doing a Gatt deal, he will never
insist. To do so might not only endanger the position of Mr Balladur, who
might be toppled by his party leader and presidential rival, Mr Jacques
Chirac; it would severely strain the overall Franco-German relationship,
more important to both countries than any individual policy.
Neither side sees Gatt as a real threat to their relationship. An Elysee
official says: 'We do not see Gatt as a confrontation with Germany, but
rather with the US and it is easier in France to stir up anti-American
reflexes than anti-German ones.'
The same sentiment exists on the Rhine. 'It is not a question of pressure by
one side on the other. That is a rather Anglo-Saxon formulation,' says Mr
Ingo Kolboom of the German Foreign Policy Association in Bonn. 'The
relationship does not function like that. It is a matter of mutual
persuasion . . . and the French know that they are a modern industrial
state.'
Assuming such self-knowledge on the part of many French is, however, a bit
risky. They regard Gatt as a pistol held to the nation's head and see images
of their past collective life passing nostalgically in front of them: Van
Gogh's golden wheat fields, which would lie forever fallow because of the
Blair House cuts in subsidised cereal exports; or arty Truffaut films, which
would be pushed out of French cinemas by Hollywood blockbusters given even
freer rein under Gatt.
France is only now coming to political terms with an industrialisation
process far slower than that of many of its partners. Whereas, for instance,
the rural population in Britain had shrunk to 42 per cent in 1881, it was
only well after the second world war, in 1954, that France's rural community
dwindled to that level.
Since then, however, the modernisation of agriculture has increased apace.
Active farmers now account for 6 per cent of the population. The average
size of farms is more than 30 hectares and half are now run as companies.
Mechanisation and flight from the land has resulted in the paradox that as
it has become a world 'agri-power', so France has ceased to be a mainly
agrarian society.
But French farmers retain an outsize political clout, providing the swing
vote of more than 10 per cent in a fifth of the National Assembly's 557
seats. No less than a third of the country's 36,000 mayors describe
themselves as farmers or retired farmers. And in the Hotel de Ville in Paris
sits Mr Chirac who has never forgotten how much he enjoyed himself as
agriculture minister in the early 1970s.
However, there are now faint signs of the emergence of countervailing
pressure to the farm lobby. The exporters of (unsubsidised) wines and
spirits have come out squarely in favour of Gatt. The house magazine of the
Institut de l'Entreprise, a select club of France's top captains of
industry, recently dared to say what its members have been privately telling
Mr Balladur in an article entitled 'Let's hope France is bluffing'.
It stated: 'If France were to carry the blame for the breakdown of a
multilateral trade accord wished by all its partners, it would very quickly
lose all the standing it has acquired with its foreign clients over
decades.'
This is precisely the message Bonn would like to see spread in France, but
dare not to do so overtly itself. 'We have been terribly careful not to be
seen to dictate or interfere in the French debate,' says a senior diplomat
in Bonn. 'We have simply tried to suggest to some leading people in the
French media that there may be another, more positive side to the Gatt. We
have not been very successful.'
Certainly, the big fear among Gatt's supporters on the both sides of the
Rhine is that Mr Balladur has left it too late to start selling a world
trade agreement to his country. 'Something must be found which makes it
impossible for the French to say No,' says the German diplomat. And in the
German view, a large part of the answer must come from Washington.

Given the hotel chain's pre-tax Pounds 1.04bn loss for its last year of

watch out for small print; such as 'while stocks last'.

<TEXT>
Beware of gift-bearing-Greeks, particularly politicians. Constantine
Mitsotakis, no longer Greece's prime minister but merely a humble
backbencher, is getting a grilling over who or what provided his impressive
private collection of antiquities.
While in office his daughter - Dora Bakoyiannis - served as culture
minister, fending off archaeologists' allegations that part of her father's
collection of Minoan vases and Cretan jewellery - more than 1,000 items -
derived from a looted ancient cemetery.
Mitsotakis probably won't face formal accusations of antiquity stealing;
since 1979 he has had a private collector's licence.
But Melina Mercouri - she of the 1980s campaign to get the British Museum to
return the Elgin Marbles to Greece - is now the new culture minister.
Mercouri is renewing the Elgin war; and she is also investigating the
Mitsotakis mystery.

The hunt is on for a chief executive of the Sydney Olympic Games organising
committee; but Rod McGeoch, a 47-year-old Sydney lawyer, couldn't care less.
That's odd, because McGeoch led Sydney's successful September bid to host
the games in the year 2000.
McGeoch is cheesed off at lack of official recognition for those who worked
on the bid; he has walked out.
There have been other hiccups too. John Fahey, the New South Wales premier,
has incurred some ire for having snatched responsibility for the games from
Bruce Baird, NSW transport minister. Baird had done most of the work in the
bid run-up.
Then there are the rumours
of a 'budget blowout', euphemistically disguising possible capital
expenditure excesses.
Finally, John Valder, the bid's main fundraiser, claims he has been kicked
off the organising committee's board because no-one had remembered to
appoint a woman.
The first task of the new chief executive will be to engender a little more
jeu d'esprit amongst the organisers.

Chairing a discussion between South African finance minister Derek Keys and

mildly surprised at the lack of flying fur.
He shouldn't have been. The two have a public policy tango; Keys espouses
the 'social objectives' of economic policy and Manuel speaks of 'flying the

Sir Alan nevertheless demonstrated a sense of humour by presenting them each
with a copy of Lady Thatcher's book The Downing Street Years - itself
jam-packed with public tangos which fell apart when the going got tough.

<TEXT>
Good to see the Treasury at last employing outside help to assist it decide
the fate of its creaking economic model.
Alison Sprague, an economist and computer modelling expert at KPMG Peat
Marwick, has passed her slide rule over several of the outfits which might
have a crack at running the model, should the boffins throw in the towel
themselves.
Her report is about as closely guarded a secret as the Budget.
Nevertheless, Observer gathers that the general idea is partial
privatisation, by way of soliciting advice on updates to the model.
A former colleague of one of the Treasury's advisers, Patrick Minford,
Sprague has spent several weeks on the telephone to the likes of the London
Business School, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and
Warwick University.
One notable omission is the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
Its boss, Doug McWilliams, recently uncovered an embarrassing flaw in the
way the model treats consumer spending.
But it looks as if a degree of residual Whitehall amour propre prevents his
flair being directly acknowledged - at least for now.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Talking to the IRA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who seeks peace in Northern Ireland, at an honourable price, should
support Mr John Major today. The prime minister has been charged with
duplicity, on the ground that his government has sanctioned secret contacts
with the Irish Republican Army in spite of its frequent protestations that
it would never negotiate with terrorists.
This is a setback for those who believe that governments must at all times
behave like boy scouts, but the alternative would have been worse. Public
deal-making with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, could not be
countenanced by a democratically elected British administration unless the
bombers of Warrington and the Shankill Road turned convincingly away from
violence.
Yet a refusal to keep open unofficial lines of communication would have
denied the government the chance to make its own position plain, and to take
note of any peace proposals coming from the other side.
The Israelis spent some time in secret conclave with the Palestine
Liberation Organisation before emerging in public with their recent deal. Mr
Major has not gone nearly as far as that, nor could he even if he wanted to:
unlike Israel, he is not in the business of trading territory for peace.
Constitutional future
British policy is clear. If the IRA lays down its arms, and an unspecified
period of 'quarantine' has passed, Sinn Fein can join talks about the
constitutional future of Northern Ireland. Relations with the republic of
Ireland will be discussed with Dublin. Any proposals arising from such talks
would have to be endorsed by the voters of Northern Ireland. The unionists
would therefore retain their veto on any plan to move towards a united
Ireland - a point Mr Major again needs to make plain today. Republicans
would have to persuade them to change their minds. The IRA is thus invited
to abandon its campaign of violence and to rely on Sinn Fein's re-entry to
the political process. It can show whether its talk of peace has any
substance by picking up that invitation today.
Mr Major, who has placed himself at the head of a drive to seek a political
settlement of the troubles, has behaved with courage, and a sense of
responsibility. Certainly, as an FT report shows today, his peace initiative
is in tune with business opinion in Ulster. It also reflects the feelings of
most ordinary people. The prime minister aims to take advantage of a tide of
popular feeling in favour of peace, while not abandoning the unionists and
their right of veto. He is therefore standing by his Northern Ireland
secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, who has no reason to resign. The latter has
said that the documents relating to back-door communications with the IRA
will be published today. It must be presumed these will confirm that the
long-standing and oft-repeated government promise to the Unionists, that the
people of Northern Ireland will be able to determine their own future, will
be seen to have been respected.
Limit the damage
Northern Ireland being what it is, this will not satisfy everyone. The cries
of 'betrayal' from the Reverend Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists are
routine; the more measured response from Mr Molyneaux's larger unionist
party suggests that it may be possible to limit the damage to the prime
minister's peace initiative. It is often remarked that the government
depends on unionist votes to shore up its uncertain parliamentary majority,
but, against that, the unionists depend on the continuance in office of the
Conservatives. To Ulster ears, Labour sounds pro-republican. A greater
danger lies on the right wing of Mr Major's own party, where pro-unionist
speeches have recently been made by Lord Tebbit and the former chancellor,
Mr Norman Lamont. Initial reactions to the weekend's news, notably from Mr
Lamont, suggest that the damage may be containable.
With luck, and skill in handling the house of commons, Mr Major and Sir
Patrick should be able to weather today's political storm. Assuming that
they do, there should be no hesitation in pressing on with the peace
initiative. The next step for the prime minister will be to confirm the date
for his planned summit meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister. Friday would not be too soon.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Yet to win his new democrat spurs: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the White House victory on the North American Free Trade Agreement
many Republicans began to revise their opinion of President Bill Clinton.
His advocacy of lower trade barriers with Mexico was so passionate, it
seemed churlish to doubt his credentials as a 'new democrat' - a man
obviously committed to market forces.
At the Seattle meeting with Asian leaders, Mr Clinton scaled new rhetorical
heights. Turning to the far more important battle for global trade
liberalisation, he claimed a new Gatt agreement could transform the US
economy, eventually creating 1.4m jobs and raising average household incomes
by Dollars 1,700. 'This, my fellow Americans,' he said, 'is the answer to 20
years of stagnant wages for the hard-working middle class.' It could have
been George Bush speaking.
Mr Vin Weber, a leading Republican strategist, promptly welcomed Mr Clinton
into the conservative fold. He pointed out, correctly, that tariffs and
quotas are merely taxes and government regulation by another name. Mr
Clinton could not logically favour free trade without also favouring free
enterprise and low taxes domestically. Policies the president deemed
essential abroad could scarcely be harmful at home.
In the forthcoming battles over healthcare reform and other social policies,
Mr Clinton should thus not feel dependent on support from unions and other
stalwarts of the Democratic left. Provided he stuck to the principles he
enunciated so clearly in the Nafta debate, conservatives would flock to the
Clinton cause. The impromptu Nafta coalition could be converted into a
permanent congressional force for market-oriented reform.
It was an inspired if mischievous, thought. But is Mr Clinton really a new
style of Democrat? He only began to fight hard for Nafta once he realised a
defeat could undermine his authority in foreign policy and perhaps his
standing as president. If you consider his first year as a whole, his record
is less impressive. Indeed, only a few months ago, Mr Clinton was looking
about as modern as Walter Mondale in 1984.
Having just forced through a budget that raised the top rate of personal
income tax by a third, he did not seem remotely concerned by the adverse
impact this domestic tariff might have on incentives for high-paid
individuals or the owners of successful small businesses. The only thing
that mattered about the budget was its 'fairness' - the fact that nearly all
the new taxes were to be borne by the wealthiest 1-2 per cent of families.
But for a Senate filibuster, Mr Clinton's budget would have included a
wholly unnecessary short-term Keynesian stimulus. In these pre-Nafta days,
Mr Clinton's rhetoric on trade was far less enlightened. He tried to inflict
a crass form of 'managed trade' on Japan, involving quantitative targets for
various industrial sectors. In stark contradiction to the rule-based Gatt
system which he is now championing, it sought guarantees from Japan that
chunks of its domestic market would be reserved for US and foreign
companies.
So who is the real Bill Clinton? Is he the ardent advocate of global free
trade, the man who promises to 'compete, not retreat.' Or is he the
old-style Mondale democrat, keen on soaking the rich, revving up the economy
and bashing the Japanese?
The answer will become apparent only as the coming year's debate on social
policy begins to heat up. A deal with the right is certainly conceivable.
Most conservative Democrats and Republicans are doubtful about central
elements of the Clinton healthcare plan, such as the proposed caps on growth
of private insurance premiums and the 'mandate' requiring all employers to
pay 80 per cent of employees' healthcare costs. But many enthusiastically
support other elements, such as the attempt to increase cost efficiency by
promoting 'managed competition' between private-sector providers of care. If
Mr Clinton is willing to negotiate, he might be able to assemble a centrist
coalition similar to that which triumphed on Nafta.
Similar considerations apply in welfare reform and job training. Many
Republicans were impressed by Mr Clinton's campaign pledge to introduce a
strict two-year limit on welfare payments, after which most recipients would
have to enrol in training schemes or accept jobs. Conservatives recognise
the need to upgrade training to give workers displaced by global competition
a better chance of acquiring new skills. They would probably support a
Clinton job-training initiative, if it incorporated market-oriented
mechanisms, such as vouchers.
There are good political reasons for Mr Clinton to move to the right on
social policy. By firmly occupying the middle ground of US politics, he
would reduce his vulnerability to a presidential challenge from a moderate
Republican in 1996.
Yet it is far from clear that he will jump this way. Mr Clinton's top social
policy advisers, such as his wife Hillary and Mr Robert Reich, the Labour
Secretary, seem less market-oriented than the Treasury officials who played
a big role in the trade debate. After Nafta, Mr Clinton is bound to want to
restore cordial relations with organised labour. All this may preclude
radicalism on healthcare, welfare or job training. The notion that the Nafta
coalition can be transformed into a permanent force for radical reform may
be too good to be true. Mr Clinton has yet to earn his new democrat spurs.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Leading Article: A mega-bond for London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rage Londoners feel over the unreliability, inadequacy and squalor of
their city's transport system last week reached boiling point. A power
black-out trapped tens of thousands of passengers in London Underground's
tunnels. Many more were left waiting for buses or delayed in traffic jams.
Others stayed at home.
If last week's chaos was a freak event, it could be forgiven. But it is
merely the latest in the catalogue of misery that Londoners have to endure
almost daily. If they travel underground, they face packed carriages,
out-of-order escalators and cancellations. If they travel by road, they are
often delayed in traffic.
It is not just passengers who suffer. London's attraction as an
international centre of wealth creation is being compromised. Companies lose
out directly when employees cannot make it in to work. In the long run,
business could migrate to more efficient locations.
Decades of under-investment, poor management and antiquated labour practices
are now bearing their bitter fruit. The urgent priority is to find extra
resources. London First, the business-led group, thinks Pounds 17bn will be
needed over 10 years to modernise the underground and to finance new
projects such as Crossrail.
Where are such vast sums going to come from? On current plans, only half
will come from central government. Given the enormous budget deficit, there
is little chance of more cash from that source. In fact, further cuts are
possible in this week's budget.
Passengers benefit
Wholesale privatisation is not a realistic prospect either. The underground
would only become profitable if its network was shrunk and fares increased
sharply. Meanwhile, although the group set up this month under Sir Alastair
Morton may inject life into the government's initiative of attracting
private finance for infrastructure projects, even enthusiasts recognise that
subsidies will be needed before most such schemes can be profitable.
But there is no reason why this money must come from central government
coffers. In so far as passengers benefit from better services, it is right
that they pay more. But it is right that those who have property in the city
and those who travel on its roads should also pay their share.
What are needed are new mechanisms to raise funds. Why not earmark a portion
of the capital's business rates and council taxes? After all, better public
transport would increase property values. Or why not hypothecate revenue
from London's street parking charges? Car-users would benefit from roads not
being so crammed.
Revenue streams
Once new fund-raising devices were authorised, there would be no need to
wait for the cash to trickle in. It would be possible to issue a
multi-billion pound bond, secured by future revenue streams. Funds could
speedily be made available to subsidise the underground's modernisation and
new private-sector projects.
How should such an initiative be co-ordinated? While ministers would prefer
a quango - if they could be persuaded to look at the idea at all - a
democratically accountable body would be better. There should be no taxation
without representation.
But ministers would not have to resurrect the ghost of the Labour-dominated
Greater London Council. The new body would focus on transport alone. It
would not own the underground and new projects. The relationship could be an
arm's-length contract, under which the body provided investment funds in
return for specified service improvements. With such contracts in place, it
might even be possible to privatise the underground and start to sort out
its management and labour problems.
Other ways could be found to make the body appeal more to ministers. For
example, it could cover parts of the commuter belt, so ensuring it was not
always Labour-run. Its authority could be limited in time, say to a decade.
Ministers might even appoint its members but require investment and
fund-raising plans to be approved by referendum.
Such an initiative could only be undertaken if ministers were willing to
slaughter a herd of sacred cows. But, given that the alternative is
continued decay, a radical approach is needed.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Take the trade deal on the table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir DEREK THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Trade talks' (November 25), rightly underlines the
urgency of resolving the outstanding issues in the Uruguay Round before the
December 15 deadline and goes on to deplore the new problems which the US is
introducing at this late stage. But, characteristically, you left out one
area which is of great importance for the European services sector.
Throughout the Round, the UK has pressed for an outcome which would advance
the interests of service providers in the UK and the rest of Europe. We
would not pretend that this aim has yet been fully met. The commitments of
many of our trading partners could certainly be bettered.
But the Uruguay Round is more a staging post than a final destination. A
worthwhile initial package of commitments certainly is now within reach and
there is a framework of clear, internationally-accepted rules as a basis for
more liberalisation in the future. Some of our partners fail to recognise
this, and still seek a perfect outcome in their particular sector, at the
risk of losing the benefits of the whole. This is short-sighted and
illusory.
Surely the world's economic leaders must now secure the gains already within
sight by pushing the Round to a successful conclusion. What is on the table
is worth having and we must not lose it. The alternative is a return to the
protectionist tit-for-tat of the 1930s which, even without the world's
present state of instability, would not bear contemplation.
To argue the services case in terms of a glass half full or half empty is to
miss the point. The point for services is that for the first time there is
now a glass on the table that will hold water for the future. Let's for
goodness sake pick it up.

FT  29 NOV 93 / UK's misguided attack on Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It too often seems the Brussels Commission can do no good in British eyes -
it is attacked by British ministers both when it is wrong and when it is
right. The widely reported strictures made by Kenneth Clarke, the British
chancellor, on Community documents at a finance ministers' meeting in
Brussels a week ago today, is a case in point.
Ministers had in front of them at least two separate economic documents. One
was a 'Note on the Economic Elements of the White Paper' that the Community
president, Jacques Delors, will be presenting at the forthcoming EU summit,
but which will fortunately not be binding. The second was a draft 'Framework
for the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines' required under the multilateral
surveillance clauses of the Maastricht Treaty.
The White Paper draft deserves all the invective of which Mr Clarke is
capable, and more. Indeed Jacques Delors himself seemed to a few of those
present to be distancing himself from it. Some people have divined behind
the thick fog of its prose a call for compulsory shorter hours. That is the
least of its faults. The document has all the hallmarks of the Social
Affairs Directorate. Its prose is Eurospeak at its very worst and it is
difficult to imagine in what language (if any) it was originally written.
There is no diagnosis of the causes of unemployment and no meaningful policy
prescription. An example is paragraph five: 'Our intuition, backed by the
renewed dynamism shown by the European economies from 1985 to 1990, is that
Europeans can conceive a model of development in line with their traditions,
preserving their social model while adapting it, fully integrating
technological progress and the environment, offering to all the prospect of
integration in society through work, social activity, participation as a
citizen.' That is one of the clearer sentences.
Indeed the authors throw in every worthy development of which they can
think, such as 'the accelerating pace of the information-technology
industry, the audio-visual sector and biotechnology' - the modern
equivalents of the traditional American invocation of motherhood and apple
pie.
The subtext is of course clearer. The authors would like to defend all the
most unfortunate European institutions (miscalled 'social') such as minimum
wages, the enforcement of nationwide collective bargaining agreements, heavy
overhead employment expenses and labour market restrictions. But fearing to
do so too explicitly, they try to be all things to all men.
By contrast, the Economic Guidelines - obviously drawn up by the DG2
directorate - were as different from the white paper as chalk from cheese.
The original draft called for a reduction of two to three percentage points
in average Community short-term interest rates, with the lead taken by
Germany. This would signal to economic agents 'that the worst is over, that
monetary policy had been loosened as much as it was possible and that
nothing would be gained by further postponing any investment decisions which
may have been contingent on the availability of the best financing
conditions'. I would have preferred some justification for these figures -
which could easily have been given in the context of an objective for a
non-inflationary growth path for nominal GDP. But they are somewhere in the
right ball park.
Unfortunately Germany, the Netherlands and the UK managed to get this
suggestion removed from the final draft. In doing so the British chancellor
has scored an own goal. For it is only in the context of European or
worldwide interest rate reductions that the restrictive effect of British
fiscal tightening can be offset without taking the irresponsible risks with
sterling that a British dash for ultra cheap money would entail.
On the labour market front, the original guidelines called for an average
increase in real wages of one percentage point per annum less than the rise
in productivity. This is as near DG2 could go in embracing the notion of
pricing people into work. An implication of the guideline would be a trend
rise in the share of profits in the national income.
The suggestion was however too much for the ministers who downgraded the
suggestion to the historical statement that such moderation in real wage
gains had occurred in 1982-89. The one area where the ministers firmed up
the guidelines was the insertion of an explicit inflation target of two to
three per cent per annum by 1996, a magnificent victory in the last war.
The headline controversies were about the Commission's original target of at
least 15m new jobs, to halve unemployment by the year 2000. Obviously this
is an aspiration: the red meat is in the policy proposals (and of course in
purely market-generated changes). Still, in the words of the poet Robert
Browning, 'a man's reach should exceed his grasp'. But even the aspiration
was too much for ministers who watered it down to a numerical illustration.
The whole episode raises the wider question of the minimalist British
attitude to the European Monetary Institute which starts work this coming
January in Frankfurt. The work of this Institute offers the best hope of a
concerted European monetary policy designed to support non-inflationary
growth; and its efforts in the not-so-distant future could be far more
important for the outlook for production and jobs than the parochial detail
of the UK Budget. But has anyone so briefed Mr Clarke?

FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Trade and service mark options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT A HURST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although I was pleased to read Robert Rice's report on November 19
('Registration to be simplified', November 19) to the effect that the
long-awaited Trade Marks Bill is to be introduced in the current
parliamentary session, I should like to draw your attention to two slight
errors.
First, I am afraid that the Queen's Speech was too late to influence the
choice of location for the European Trade Marks Office, which (it was
decided at the EU summit at the end of October) is to be located in Spain.
London has accordingly missed the boat.
Second, the proposed ratification of the Madrid protocol for the
registration of international trade marks through the medium of the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is independent of the EU Directive
of December 1988, which merely instructs member states to harmonise their
local trade mark laws.
By 1995, companies will have the option of applying for three alternative
forms of trade or service mark:
a. In the UK, under the new Trade Marks Act.
b. Internationally, through the medium of WIPO in Geneva.
c. In Europe, through the medium of the Community Trade Mark Office in
Alicante.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Assumptions on benefits of UK
forestry privatisation flawed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'The Future of the Forests' (November 23) suggests that
privatisation of the Forestry Commission has some merit, particularly in
addressing the commission's current shortcomings. But it makes two
fundamental assumptions which need to be challenged.
First, the commission has already made headway on the issues of hidden
environmental costs, bureaucracy and unfulfilled recreational potential for
which it is criticised. Progress towards quantifying and defining the costs
of environmental benefits has been made through the new special management
grant and the community woodland supplement for tree planting. The
reorganisation of the commission last year has helped to improve its
effectiveness and the fact that the commission's forests receive 50m visits
per year indicates it fulfils its recreational potential very well.
Second, and much more importantly, there is an assumption that privatisation
could protect non-economic benefits. The role of the commission has changed
out of all recognition since the 1970s when timber production at all costs
was its watchword. It now takes a lead in promoting multi-purpose forestry -
integrating access, landscape and wildlife conservation with timber
production in its own forests and as a regulatory authority for felling and
planting. This change has been hard won and like many other organisations
the Woodland Trust wants to see the status quo retained, consolidated and
given a chance to work. Private interests have yet to show whole-hearted
enthusiasm for guarding access and conservation interests even when
incentives are available.
We have major concerns that the estimated Pounds 35m-Pounds 40m annual
public subsidy which would be needed for private landowners to maintain the
commission's current environmental management standards would not be
forthcoming in the current climate on public spending. Voluntary bodies like
ourselves would be left with an impossible task in trying to protect
woodlands of major environmental significance.

Sir, The price of the FT is worth it for the articles by your excellent TV
critic, Christopher Dunkley, alone.
In 'Up with sex, down with violence' (November 24), he correctly shows the
proper distinction and encourages those of us who would like to see more
freedom of expression on TV for the things we enjoy (like sex) while
deploring the depiction of aggressive and violent behaviour.
Those in continental Europe seem to understand the difference - why not we

FT  29 NOV 93 / Furrowed brows look to lean year: Deborah Hargreaves and
Alison Maitland on the shift in UK agriculture away from family holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ranks of shiny new tractors unveiled at the Royal Smithfield
agricultural show in London today would cause more than a glint of envy in
Mr Peter Swift's eye.
Mr Swift, a Lancashire vegetable and cereal farmer, has watched neighbouring
producers on large arable farms enjoying a bonanza year; many of them have
seen their incomes rise faster than the average for all farmers last year.
But Mr Swift faced the prospect of losing his 92-acre holding this summer
when mounting debts meant he was unable to hire help for the swede harvest.
In the end, two friends helped him at weekends.
'I'm not ashamed to say I've been living on charity for six months,' he
says. Far from investing in new machinery, he does not own a tractor and is
rushing to harvest his crops to curb hire costs. He has only stayed in
business because of a sympathetic bank manager, he says.
In contrast, Mr Adrian Peck, who farms 1,000 acres in Cambridgeshire - the
grain belt of Britain where farms are large and the farmers the richest in
the UK - has just bought a new tractor. He has been able to take advantage
of a boost to his income caused by the 20 per cent devaluation last year of
the 'green pound' which is used to translate prices set by the European
Union into sterling. In total, British farmers are an estimated Pounds 135m
better off this year thanks to the devaluation. Mr Swift receives little
support from Brussels because most of his crops are not covered by the
European Common Agricultural Policy. He is left victim to the vagaries of
the free market.
Such mixed fortunes highlight the shift that is taking place in agriculture
in the UK, away from traditional, small, family holdings. Competition is
intensifying as world prices for many commodities fall - and European
Union-supported prices in particular.
But while the larger farmers may be enjoying a breathing space, the
pressures on farmers are set to increase. Additional reforms of CAP are
likely to cut subsidies even further and a possible new General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade would step up competition.
Together European agriculture ministers have agreed that EU farmers should
be exposed increasingly to the free market and the impact of the Brussels
farm support price regime gradually diminished.
So far, however, the effects have been softened in the UK by the devaluation
of the green pound, which has increased cereal prices and boosted payments
under the controversial set-aside scheme which pays grain farmers to grow
less. Mr Peck hopes to receive a cheque soon from the government for close
to Pounds 13,500 for leaving 150 acres of his land lying fallow this year.
Some of the farmers receiving compensation payment are rich landowners - a
fact that particularly galls Mr Swift. Unlike almost any other form of state
income support, agricultural aid is not means tested.
UK farmers have been helped further by low interest rates and the 40 per
cent tax allowance on farm equipment that the government announced in the
March Budget and which lasted until the end of last month. Sales of tractors
 -regarded as an important indicator of farmers' fortunes - were up 30 per
cent in the 10 months to the end of October after record-low sales last
year. But they are still only about half the level of 10 years ago.
The National Farmers' Union expects the continuing impact of devaluation
will result in growth in average farm incomes this year exceeding last
year's 23.6 per cent increase, thanks to the continued impact of sterling's
devaluation in the first half. But optimism is patchy. Not all sectors are
feeling the effects of devaluation. And particularly pessimistic are smaller
farmers who have not been protected so much by the CAP, even though the
scheme was originally supposed to help them.
Mr Swift sees little hope for farmers like him: 'There is no future for a
family farm like ours - we're only just surviving. I'm not really making a
living, I'm just paying bills.' He, and other small farmers, are
increasingly looking to find part-time employment.
Mr John Earl, a pig farmer from Kent, says he is selling his animals at 90p
a kilo when it costs him Pounds 1 a kilo to rear them. Pork prices are not
supported under the CAP. 'We are tightening our belts, but we can't go on in
that situation for long,' he says.
Smaller farmers are facing pressure to diversify into leisure or tourist
facilities. 'It is part of a general pattern; the large farms are getting
bigger and the family farms are being squeezed to look for alternative
income,' says Mr David Lloyd-Jones who runs holiday cottages on his mixed
livestock farm in Wales.
Among the farm industry as a whole there is a fear that the larger operators
will not long escape such gloom and that the good times currently being
enjoyed will soon turn into lean years.
Last year's CAP reforms were designed to be neutral for the European farmer
on an average income; compensation payments would be made for three years to
counteract the planned falls in prices. But Mr Sean Rickard, the NFU's chief
economist, says Britain's arable farms are larger than the European average
and tend to grow more grain per acre. Compensation payments will not offset
the price falls. Separately, in the next few years, once the effects of
devaluation have worn off, payments for set-aside are likely to fall short
of revenues foregone.
Moreover, after the three years covered by the current CAP reforms, many
farmers believe support prices will be reduced again. A Gatt agreement would
also have the effect of cutting EU support prices even further, bringing
many close to world levels.
Mr Peck fears that he and his large-farmer counterparts will have to reckon
with competition from big farmers from, for example, Australia and the US.
He points to wheat farms in Australia which are on average twice as big as
his and more highly mechanised: 'how could we in Britain compete with that -
we'd have to dig up the countryside,' he argues.
Mr Malcolm McAllister, managing director of Booker Farming, which farms
directly or advises on the management of 45,000 acres in England and
Scotland, says a Gatt agreement would squeeze less efficient producers and
hasten the concentration of farming.
'Farming will move to areas of natural advantage - our best farms in East
Anglia are world-competitive cereal producers. But if you're a struggling
Cumbrian wheat grower you will give up. That shift is already happening but
the CAP reform and a Gatt deal will hasten it,' he says.
Faced with these mounting pressures, many farmers believe that the
short-term gains they are enjoying offer a limited chance to pay off some
debt and invest in equipment or land. 'This is an opportunity for farmers to
re-group and restructure, making them better able to withstand the effects
of the Gatt when it comes,' said Mr David Naish, president of the NFU.
There are signs that some producers are already heeding his advice. Farm
debt levels in England and Wales peaked at Pounds 6.6bn in August 1991
according to the Midland Bank, dropping to Pounds 5.8bn by October this
year. Yet a survey published today by Adas, the government's farm advisory
service, suggests that investment by farmers, though rising this year, is in
long-term decline; sales of farm machinery are 34 per cent lower than in
1988.
Farmers are notorious for not underplaying their misfortunes. But at least
for the larger farmers, the bonanza they are currently enjoying means there
is little excuse for not taking action to secure their future against the
uncertainties of increased competition in years ahead. That, though, will be
little consolation for the small players such as Mr Swift.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Face up to deficit by borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M C KENNEDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stephen Bell of Morgan Grenfell could hardly put the case better when
he writes that recession leads to a loss of industrial capacity and to more
unemployable labour (Letters, November 25).
Why then does he call for 'massive increases in taxation and/or reductions
in public expenditure' to close the budget deficit? He must surely know that
such 'massive' measures will lead to a correspondingly 'massive' worsening
of the recession, to more unemployment and to further losses of industrial
capacity. Samuel Brittan, in a series of articles, has been correct in
repeatedly questioning the seriousness of the budget deficit and in warning
against panic over its size.
The best way of handling the deficit in present conditions is to go on
borrowing. We have already seen from the experience of this year that this
can be done without the rise in interest rates (and fall in security prices)
which some people in the City are so fearful of.
More generally, fiscal action should always be undertaken with a view to its
effects on the economy - on inflation, employment and industry.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: Docklands Sinfonietta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two nights after the BBC Symphony played Szymanowski and Lutoslawski
superbly at Maida Vale, both composers reappeared in the Docklands
Sinfonietta's programme in the Queen Elizabeth Hall (also live on Radio 3).
Szymanowski's Songs of a Fairytale Princess came from the same
rapturous-exotic period as his First Violin Concerto, and they, too, keep
their soloist up in the stratosphere; he wrote them for his sister, who must
have been a remarkably assured high soprano.
So, fortunately, is Eileen Hulse, who warbled and floated through them on
Friday to enchanting effect. They will never be in the repertoire of many
sopranos, for it is a rare voice that is both at home on those heights and
has enough succulent tone to fill out the luscious swoops of the music. It
is a little unfair to hear them so soon after the glorious Concerto, for
they share its heady atmosphere - not quite so rich, for here the orchestral
part is transcribed from the piano original - without the memorable tunes.
Still, hearing them at all is an unusual pleasure; Miss Hulse made it so,
and Sian Edwards conducted with delicacy and insight. I was less sure about
Lutoslawski's recent, delightful song-cycle Chantefleurs et Chantefables, on
children's poems by Robert Desnos. Miss Hulse, who was replacing an
indisposed singer at short notice, sounded well in command of the subtle,
funny verses, and the conductor captured the gaits of Desnos's fauna
(grasshopper, tortoise, alligator) wittily - yet the set sounded 'careful',
without the crisp bite that all Lutoslawski music should have.
One more rehearsal might have got it. Two more were needed for Roussel's
rackety Petite Suite: there were trumpet problems, and a dearth of irony and
elegance. By the end of the concert, however, the Sinfonietta had found its
proper form, and delivered Haydn's Symphony no. 60, 'Il Distratto', with all
due alertness and verve. Haydn's score stemmed from some theatre-music;
Edwards and her players warmed to that, and it all gleamed with character.

The title of BBC1's documentary Doctor Who: 30 Years In The Tardis (BBC1,
8.00) is a bit of a misnomer since the BBC decided to kill off its famous
creation while he was still in his twenties. They are now reduced to showing
repeats. The good doctor is one of the BBC's most successful characters.
This programme brings together Jon Pertwee, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy
who all played the title role.
ITV's three-part drama A Woman's Guide To Adultery (9.00), based on the
novel by Carol Clewlow, is all about mistresses. Rose, who disapproves of
adultery, has three friends who are having affairs with married men. When
she goes back to university she suddenly finds herself succumbing to
precisely the same temptation. A strong cast includes Theresa Russell,
Amanda Donohoe and Sean Bean.
After so many documentaries about the armed services and the police, C4
begins a two-part programme about the Royal Navy's own police force in
Cutting Edge: 'Navy Blues' (9.00). Drugs, homosexuality and desertion all
feature in this opening episode.

We are almost there. Tomorrow's FT will publish the name of this year's
winner of the Financial Times Architecture Award. He or she will receive
Britain's most independent and highly regarded architectural prize at a
luncheon in London today. The long period of judging and visiting is over
and there will be an opportunity in tomorrow's paper for an assessment of
the significance of the award and of the state of architecture in Britain
today.
Previous articles have looked at five of the eight shortlisted schemes:
Stansted Airport and Cranfield Library by Sir Norman Foster and Partners;
and Bracken House, Schlumberger Research and Bedfont Lakes (IBM) Business
Park by Michael Hopkins and Partners. The remaining three schemes on the
shortlist represent three very different types of building. The Queen's
Stand at Epsom Racecourse by Richard Horden Associates; the new car park in
Chichester by Birds Portchmouth and Russum; and Winchester City offices
designed by the Hampshire County Architects department.
Epsom clearly needed an elegant new stand that could comfortably house the
crowds on Derby day as well as provide a centre for functions and
entertainments throughout the year. The choice of Richard Horden and
Associates as architects was a brave one. The practice is known for its
structural and engineering expertise and its experimental approach to
building technology. The client, United Racecourses, has, by choosing a
radical approach that is both refined and practical, acquired a new stand
that is the acme of contemporary design.
The problem of new buildings in England's cathedral cities has been tackled
in two very distinctive and different ways in Winchester and Chichester.
Both cities have mixed reputations when it comes to new architecture, but it
is fair to say that both places take great care about any additions to their
ancient fabric.
Winchester has a county architects department that is one of the most
distinguished in the country. Under the direction of Colin Stansfield-Smith,
Hampshire has acquired a high reputation, particularly for its new schools
and other educational buildings. The site of the new offices, which are
partly occupied by the architects' department, is a typical, tight
Winchester street, but one that had been spoiled in earlier days by the
erection of a large multi-storey car park. The new offices try to be both
modern and vernacular, adopting a traditional pitched roofline but lighting
the offices through a completely glazed wall. This gives it the appearance
of working in an atrium, except that it has a remarkable view over the city.
An agreeable courtyard garden designed around an existing tree is another
feature of the scheme, adding to its overall picturesque qualities. The
pavement passed close to one side of the new block and this facade has been
enlivened by the presence of specially commissioned stained glass windows.
Chichester had a problem. The city is keen on traffic management and car
parking is a crucial element of any traffic scheme. The decision to build a
large, new multi-storey car park on the edge of the city centre but outside
the old city walls was a controversial one. Chichester decided to commission
a relatively unknown young practice, Birds Portchmouth and Russum, and the
resulting building is extraordinary in many ways.
The architects decided not to diminish the scale of the whole operation but
to make the car park look like a new set of city defences. The length of the
building is broken up by the fat, circular staircase towers which are built
of perforated brick work. Once you have parked your car the journey from the
car park into the city centre takes you on a series of high level pedestrian
bridges from which you can view the ancient town.
Even in these recessionary years the quality of the best of British
architecture is very high. Choosing a winner for the FT award will not be
easy.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: Master Builder avoids the Scottish tendency - Theatre
in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Cox - the National Theatre's most recent Lear and the RSC's
award-winning Titus Andronicus has returned to Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum as
leading actor and co-director of Ibsen's The Master Builder.
Cox, who started his career at the Lyceum, is not one of those Scots who
disregards refined playing in favour of a Scottish slant, sometimes called
'Glaswegian vulgarity'. His Master Builder, played with Scottish accents but
set in Norway, is a splendid example to Edinburgh theatre of how to avoid
the excesses of this 'Scottish tendency'.
In a Lyceum programme interview, Cox speaks of his training at Lamda ('I
came from Dundee so Glasgow was as alien a place to me as London was') and
says that he 'can't stand nationalism'. Later this season Bill Paterson, a
more overtly Scottish actor also acclaimed for his London stage work,
returns to the Lyceum in Bulgakov's A Mongrel's Heart. It would be splendid
if, in a later season, the Lyceum could bring Cox back in a major
Shakespeare role - Anthony (and Cleopatra), Timon, Othello or, most
obviously, 'the Scottish play'.
Cox dominates this production as Halvard Solness, the master builder,
showing him as a working man who has raised himself by driving ambition and
industry; he uses his bullish, neckless, physical power and vocal force to
show this master builder as an ageing, domineering dynamo. (Morag Hood plays
his wife as an altogether more cultivated and delicate Edinburgh type,
smiling nobly through adversity: a beautiful performance.) It is plain that
Hilde Wangel (Siri Neal), who arrives to change his life, comes from far
away; she is the least Scottish character.
Cox uses ten silent young apprentices to 'frame' the production. They
function as part of Solness's workforce, as town spectators, and to help
move scenery. One in particular stands still, looking out at us, before each
act. He, and they, stand for many things: the child that Solness once was,
the children Solness and his wife lost, the youthfulness Solness dreads and
is fascinated by. Clever, but actually too intrusive in a play whose
symbolism and ambiguities are already prominent.
In this production those meanings and ambiguities are vivid. Ibsen embodies,
at the same time, the Romanticism of the early 19th century (Solness forever
bursting against the confines of home and marriage), the naturalism and
symbolism of the late 19th century (the social realism of the workplace;
Solness and Hilde building their idealistic 'castles in the air'), and the
psychological investigations of the early 20th. Tom Piper has designed sets
that economically and handsomely suggest the play's spires and aerial
castles, its utilitarian domestic architecture, its Nordic light and dark,
its Puritan simplicity, its recesses and distances.
Cox strikingly combines visceral force with intellectual refinement.
However, as in some of his recent London performances, he forces so much
volume and impact from certain lines that they break the cumulative drama.
Neal, an altogether less mighty performer, is slightly too arch a Hilde, nor
does she have all the character's heartless impulsiveness, but she keeps
keenly alive the gist and detail of every scene.
The Lyceum's previous production was Kenny Ireland's staging of A Midsummer
Night's Dream. I caught it at the end of its transfer run in Glasgow.
Ireland is developing a real repertory company here; it was good to see some
of the same actors who had been in his Recruiting Officer earlier this
autumn. Few of them, however, know how to combine clear verse-speaking with
naturalism; and Ireland added an unnecessary layer of tricksiness by placing
an echo around the fairies' voices. Rae Smith's scenery helped them to
achieve some wonderful instant disappearing acts, but everything was an
awkward mixture of staginess and superficiality - until the Pyramus and
Thisbe scene, which worked like (excuse the pun) a dream.
At the Traverse, Sue Glover's Bondagers, a hit of the 1991 season, has been
revived. A beautiful play, it movingly does honour to a vanished part of
Scottish social history: the female agricultural labourers (bondagers) who,
in the last century, moved each year from farm to farm within a small
radius. No man appears; the cast consists of six women. (Ian Brown directs.)
The finest parts of the play are the virtually plotless body of its first
half, and the ending. The story that wells up between these sections - a
tale of sexual abuse, a mentally defective girl, rape, murder or accidental
death, and punishment - is certainly affecting but relatively obvious. But
the lyricism of the outer scenes is haunting; I love the way that the
rhythms and spacings of agricultural work are caught, and the intimacies and
tensions of female colloquy. Here Scottish acting, Scottish theatre,
Scottish history are all admirably interwoven.
The Master Builder continues at the Lyceum until December 11: 031-229-9697.
Bondagers runs at the Traverse until December 19: 031-228-1404.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: Bartoli triumphs again - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All around the world there must be music-lovers discovering a fondness for
'arie antiche' that they never knew they had. The simple, catchy, innocuous
little tunes of Scarlatti and Caccini, Cesti and Caldara could be on
countless pairs of lips as Cecilia Bartoli's popularity grows ever wider.
Anybody who frequents vocal recitals knows these songs. They are the ones
that come at the beginning of the programme, before the singer has warmed
up, and then get forgotten. At least they used to be. Bartoli, in her desire
to sing Italian songs which are right for her voice and her sense of style,
has adopted them as ideal material, lavishing upon them all her very
considerable art. Suddenly they seem trifles no longer.
Almost all the first half of her Wigmore Hall recital on Friday, accompanied
by Gyorgy Fischer, was devoted to 'arie antiche'. There is a secret to
singing these miniatures. If they are to be treated as the Italian
equivalent of art-songs, then every subtle inflexion and change of colour
must sound as if it was only thought about the moment before. Bartoli, with
youth on her side (she is still in her 20s), makes them as fresh as if the
ink was still wet on the page.
The expressive colours in this mezzo voice are ravishing. Most of the time
we hear it in comedy, but an aria from Vivaldi's Bajazet showed it can be
turned no less winningly to pathos. At the end somebody near the front
called for this item to be repeated as an encore and it was just as moving
the second time round. Some delightful songs by Mozart and Bellini in the
second half were sung with the same degree of imagination, though by this
point one might have been feeling the need for something stronger.
That was supplied with the aria Qui la Voce from Bellini's I puritani -
usually for soprano, but performed here as adapted by the composer for the
mezzo Maria Malibran. To bel canto, as to everything else, Bartoli brings
her own personality, singing off the words in the aria, shaping the
cabaletta for limpid beauty, when she of all singers might have chosen to
dazzle us with her speed and agility. A move by Cecilia Bartoli into the
operas of Bellini and Donizetti would be a fascinating prospect.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: Buoyant Bhuller - Contemporary Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since he joined London Contemporary Dance Theatre a decade ago, Darshan
Singh Bhuller has been identified with dancing that is mercurial, brilliant
and varied in dynamics. In Richard Alston's The Perilous Night, his solo
helps point to the future of London Contemporary Dance, as Alston will
become director of the troupe when it mutates next year. The piece shows why
there is much to hope for from him. Of the five new works seen on Rosebery
Avenue thus far in this LDC season - one more to come next week - The
Perilous Night is the most important.
The piece uses John Cage's exercise for prepared piano of the same name.
Alston's response to the nervous drive and gamelan clangours of Cage's score
is a study in nocturnal alarms. Bhuller, in pyjama bottoms, vest, dark
glasses (not a modish accessory but a symbol of night itself), is impelled
through a sequence of dream - and possibly waking - states that convey, with
unfailing resource, the physical imprint of unease. His body opens out,
turns in on itself, builds long phrases of action that reach their
culmination in a pose which seems to reverberate in response to the piano's
sounds. The variety and imaginative richness of the dance is very fine, and
no less finely exposed by Bhuller, who can shape a span of movement, or
fragment it through a vivid shifts of timing and accent. The solo is as
memorable as Alston's earlier Soda Lake. It is excellently lit by Peter
Mumford. Cage's score is grandly performed by Nicolas Mojsiejenko. Let it
please be filmed.
Nothing else in this programme can stand close examination. Bhuller's
choreography for Fall Like Rain is a tease. There are three couples, not
radiantly happy, and a glutinous jazz score by John Martyn. Bhuller appears,
on wires, as Yadahpati, king of the sky and of rain in the Hindu pantheon,
who can foresee destiny. His interventions, swinging over the stage,
swimming through the air to touch the mortals, are visually fascinating:
there is a dance-piece to be made from the contrast between aerialism and
earth-bound movement, but this is not it. For reasons I fail to grasp,
monsoon rain falls - real water, in torrents. Everyone gets very wet, and
the dance, such as it is, looks bedraggled. Gene Kelly never had that
problem.
Christopher Bruce's Waiting has to do with the release of Nelson Mandela
from prison. The corrugated iron walls of a township serve as drums for the
cast, who also roll motorcar tyres over the stage. The ever-admirable
Kenneth Tharp dances magnificently, giving the pieties of the choreography
real urgency. Mandela, in the person of the singer Kwame Kwei-Armah,
appears. Never mind the dance; feel the predictabilities.
London Contemporary Dance season continues at Sadler's Wells until Saturday.
Programming varies. No performance today.

FT  29 NOV 93 / People: Attali's soft landing at Banque Arjil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bernard Attali, the ex-head of Air France, who recently fell from government
grace when his austerity plan for the loss-making state carrier provoked a
bitter strike, has parachuted comfortably into the job of chairing the
supervisory board of Banque Arjil, an investment bank controlled by Jean-Luc
Lagardere and his Matra-Hachette conglomerate, writes David Buchan.
Attali's arrival at Banque Arjil was far more gentlemanly than his departure
from Air France, and was apparently at the suggestion of the person he is
replacing at the investment bank, his old friend, Philippe Camus. The latter
decided he could do without the banking job and devote more time to the two
more senior posts he occupies in the Lagardere empire - director general of
Matra-Hachette, and head of the Lagardere group's financial committee.
Interested though he may be in finance - he headed the GAN insurance group
before going to Air France - Bernard Attali will hardly find the part-time
supervisory job at Banque Arjil fully occupying. He might therefore find
time to write up his airline experiences. After all, instant books run in
the family. Twin brother Jacques is rumoured to be hammering away at his
memoirs on his ill-starred time in London at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.

FT  29 NOV 93 / People: Sinegal's extensive cut-price philosophy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mixed reception awaits Jim Sinegal, 57-year-old American founder of the
Costco cut-price retailing chain, when he arrives in London today for the
opening of Britain's first warehouse club, writes Richard Tomkins. Shoppers
may be delighted at the impact he will have on British retailing. Other
store chains would sooner he had stayed at home.
Doubtless the controversy is something Sinegal would have preferred to
avoid, for as one of the less flamboyant US business executives, he shuns
publicity. He is also unusual in extending the cut-price philosophy to his
own role in the company: notoriously, his desk is out in the middle of the
work area at Costco's Seattle headquarters, separated from the rest of the
workspace only by a low divider, and he answers his own phone. His salary is
just Dollars 514,547 - a pittance for the boss of a company with annual
sales exceeding Dollars 16bn.
The low profile notwithstanding, few make the mistake of under-estimating
Sinegal. For 23 years he worked for Sol Price, the man who invented the
warehouse club concept when he set up the Price Co chain in 1976. Sinegal
looked an upstart when he decided to go his own way and set up Costco in
1983. But Costco emerged as the most successful operator in the field, and
earlier this year proved the point by taking over Price Co - though Sinegal,
true to form, had the grace to call it a merger.

FT  29 NOV 93 / People: How Dede Brooks made a bid for Sotheby's summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise and rise of Diana D. Brooks has reached its only possible summit -
this 43-year-old banker, invariably known as Dede, now runs Sotheby's, the
world's largest fine art auction house, which next year celebrates 250 years
of existence, writes Antony Thorncroft.
Last week it was announced that she was taking over from Michael Ainslie as
president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings. Only Alfred
Taubman, the chairman and chief shareholder, wields more power and his major
concern has always been his shopping mall empire. Despite its prestige,
Sotheby's is little more than a diversion for Taubman.
Dede Brooks (top right) joined Sotheby's in 1979 from Citibank. Her skills
were first devoted to the financial side in New York and she masterminded
the deals which brought to Sotheby's such lucrative estates as the
Impressionist pictures of the late Doris Havemeyer. But remorselessly she
snapped up the top managerial jobs and only last April was made president
and ceo of Sotheby's international auction business.
Since then she has been touring the world, spending much time in London
which, both for historical and geographical reasons, is vital for Sotheby's
future. New York may have replaced London as the main auction centre, but
London is the key to Europe; and it is on the continent, as well as in the
Far East, that Sotheby's seeks growth.
Her final apotheosis is not expected to limit Dede Brooks' travelling. A
tall, lively woman, who somehow manages to enjoy a happy marriage to a
venture capitalist and look after two children, she has boundless energy and
enthusiasm. She likes to mix freely with her staff and is totally lacking in
side or superiority. Her own art collection is eclectic - ranging from
antiquities to Latin American art.
Dede Brooks' timing at reaching the top could prove impeccable. Sotheby's
has been hit badly by the recession, and in its nine months' figures for
1993 it was still registering a loss. But recent successful jewels auctions
in Switzerland and art sales in New York should ensure a profit in the final
quarter of the year. It is a smaller Sotheby's work force that Dede Brooks
leads but all the signs are that she will oversee an upturn in its fortunes.

FT  29 NOV 93 / People: A belief in the power of reason - Louis Schweitzer
tells Kevin Done and John Ridding about the Renault/Volvo debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Louis Schweitzer, the chairman of Renault, likes to have a sense of
direction in his life.
It served him well during his rapid rise through the elite ranks of the
French civil service - he was chief of staff to Laurent Fabius when he was
prime minister in the mid-1980s - and by the middle of last year it had
brought him to the top of the French state-owned car group.
But for several weeks he has been left twisting in the wind as Volvo,
Renault's Swedish partner, has been forced to endure a shareholder rebellion
which threatens a planned merger between the two groups.
Shareholder resistance has already forced Volvo to postpone a vote on the
deal. Investors will now deliver their verdict on December 7.
The merger is one of the most ambitious ever attempted in the auto industry.
It would also remove Swedish control of the country's biggest industrial
group at a time when the country is already gripped by self-doubt, and is
teetering on the edge of joining the European Union.
Schweitzer is a keen theatre-goer, but he refuses to draw any business
lessons from his recent attendance of a performance of The Persians -
Aeschylus' account of how the Persians invaded Greece only to be humbled and
sent packing.
'It is in everyone's best interests that Volvo should not lose its identity,
nor its homebase. That would be crazy, that would not be sound management.
You must keep a strong base in Sweden, technically and in manufacturing.'
Schweitzer is clear that a no-vote from Volvo's shareholders would not only
rule out a full merger but, just as important, it would jeopardise the
existing far-reaching alliance between the two groups consummated in January
1991 with the exchange of sizeable cross-shareholdings.
'If there is a no, it is clear that the momentum that makes people
co-operate would be lost. The momentum would disappear. You cannot work
together without a sense of direction and there would be none,' he says.
Leaning back in his chair against a backdrop of modern art and model cars
Schweitzer still appears at ease in the face of such high stakes. But the
challenges of the merger represent unfamiliar territory. The leader of a
state-owned industry, he is confronted with a rebellion by small
shareholders and institutions. A man of reason, he has become embroiled in
an increasingly emotional debate in which he believes the facts have become
increasingly obscured.
The scale of the opposition from Swedish shareholders has caught Schweitzer
by surprise. 'The debate became rather emotional. It became so loud it was
deafening; and the issues were not being addressed.'
Schweitzer's response has been to argue his case as dispassionately as
possible. In a series of interviews with Swedish television and newspapers
and frequent visits to Volvo, the Renault chairman has sought to provide
reassurance on the principal points of resistance to the deal: the timetable
for privatisation of the merged group, and the French government's retention
of a golden share in the new company.
He has emphasised the industrial logic of the deal which he regards as vital
for both companies in the face of the increasingly competitive international
automobile industry. Economies of scale, shared buying and R&amp;D expenditure
are necessary, he says, to help ease the burdens of new product
developments.
Having made his case, he now stands firm. 'This is it, it is decision time,'
he says. 'We have presented a fair deal. Feelings sometimes overcome
reasoning in a debate; now I hope that reasoning can overcome the emotions.'
The emphasis on the power of reason to win an argument reflects his
background and education. Like other 'enarcs' - graduates of the Ecole
Nationale d'Administration, the training ground for the elite of the French
government service - Schweitzer has a training in logic and debate. 'He has
an excellent analytical mind,' says Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman.
It is not easy, however, for Schweitzer to put his message across. 'It is
not natural for Renault to go to AB Volvo shareholders. I have no reason to
say I know Swedish shareholders better than Volvo does.'
If all goes to plan, however, they will become his shareholders from the
beginning of January. As head of the industrial operations of the merged
company, Schweitzer will be in charge of its day-to-day operations. Later in
the year it is due to be privatised.
But how will a product of the French administration and public sector
industry adjust to the private sector? In particular, how will he deal with
restive Swedish shareholders?
Schweitzer is sanguine about the prospect. 'It is one of the peculiarities
of the French system that this happens,' he says, pointing to the experience
of Jacques Calvet, the head of rival car builder Peugeot-Citroen, and Michel
Pebereau, head of Banque Nationale de Paris which was successfully
privatised last month. Both had backgrounds in financial administration.
Moreover, Schweitzer argues that Renault has long been operating as a
private sector company. 'The real change occurred in 1985 when Georges Besse
(then chairman) declared that Renault should aim to become the most
profitable European volume carmaker.' That was achieved last year,' says
Schweitzer. 'Renault will stay profitable throughout this recession,' he
claims. 'That will be the ultimate test - that in the worst downturn in
history we can still make money. I think that is rather commendable.'
As for shareholders, even restive Swedish ones, Schweitzer is relaxed.
'Obviously there is a difference between having one shareholder or 1,000
shareholders, but management principles remain the same.' He argues that
sensitive decisions such as those relating to expanding or closing plants
will be taken on commercial grounds and would not be put to shareholders.
If the merger does not go through, Schweitzer believes the challenges would
be the same, but harder to deal with. 'All debates leave scars, and the
scars would remain. We would have to turn to limited partnerships with other
groups, which could give some solution to the problem of insufficient
volumes.' He points to the existing collaboration with Peugeot in V6 engines
and gearboxes. 'But it wouldn't be as good.'
The delays of recent weeks are already a source of irritation. A product of
France's fast track, Schweitzer believes in moving quickly. 'Speed is of the
essence,' he said when the merger was announced. A no vote in eight days'
time would force him to pull over to the slow lane.

for board succession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
For anyone fascinated with the way that apparently well-run and successful
companies can suddenly come to grief without warning, the past few years
have been a time of above-average interest.
Several large organisations have hit trouble in spectacular fashion. Some
collapsed altogether while others survived, but with their corporate
reputations dented.
Global recession, personal greed, over-inflated egos, the lust for power and
plain incompetence at a senior level have all contributed. But another cause
has been the lack of effective boardroom succession planning.
Some otherwise excellent board directors concentrate so hard on achieving
their business goals that they are blind to the problems they can face if
the balance of their board is upset.
What happens when the chairman slips under the proverbial red bus, or when
several board members who should already have retired decide simultaneously
that struggling each month to the boardroom for meetings is getting too much
for them? Either way, the board can unexpectedly find its composition
changed beyond recognition. Gaps may appear in the board's spread of
competences. Shareholders may be unsettled.
But these problems can be avoided. What is needed is a clear set of rules
and commitment from the directors that they will follow them.
The key is fixed retirement ages. Different age limits may suit different
companies but 60 for executive directors and 65 for non-executives has
worked well for the boards on which I have served. Equally important is the
need to maintain a balance of ages. If retirement is compulsory at 65 and
the directors are in their early 60s there are problems ahead.
The succession policy should also make it clear that non-executives are
appointed for fixed terms, with no automatic reappointment. Directorships
should be neither jobs for the boys nor jobs for life.
The ideal term is an initial three years, with another three-year period if
all is going well, followed by annual reviews. Whatever standard appointment
periods are agreed, it is important that they are there for all to see. This
does away with uncertainty and the embarrassment caused when directors have
to tell a colleague the time has come to step down.
Inevitably there will still be cases where a director will say: 'Joe has
never been fitter, and he is as bright as a button. How can we possibly let
him go just because he is 65?' This attitude must be met head-on by the
board. Unless they resist the temptation to make exceptions the benefits of
a carefully structured succession policy are lost.
And when directors do leave, how should their replacements be recruited?
During their careers company directors build up an impressive network of
contacts. Some directors think that because they have this network they know
best when it comes to choosing candidates to join the board. Unfortunately
they are usually wrong.
That is why it is essential for a headhunter to be called in. This ensures
that the widest possible range of candidates is considered and reduces the
likelihood that directors will, possibly for the wrong reasons, nominate one
of their cronies.
It is equally important that the nominations committee should have the
support of the whole board in the final selection.
The ultimate responsibility for all this lies with the chairman who, taking
a look in the corporate mirror, should have an agreed period in office and
also provide for his or her own eventual replacement. As an extension of
this, one of the first things I did in my present role was to ask our senior
non-executive director to take responsibility for organising my replacement
if that ever became necessary, for whatever reason.
Directors who fail to recognise the need for effective succession planning
at board level are storing up trouble for the future. Some may get away with
it but there is a real risk, as we have seen, that it will all end in tears.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Management: Size isn't everything - Christopher Lorenz looks
at pressure to trim head offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From General Electric and Dow Chemical in the US to British Petroleum and
ICI in the UK, countless large Anglo-Saxon companies have noisily reduced
the size of their head offices in the last few years.
But according to the authors of a comprehensive new study many corporate HQs
in Britain are still bloated, bureaucratic and, above all, muddled.
Too often, says the study, they confuse three separate roles: advising top
management; co-ordinating and controlling the company's constituent
businesses; and supplying those units with a wide range of optional advice
and services - for which too few HQs charge fees.
These damning findings contradict the widespread view that UK companies are
graduating smoothly to a more efficient world of slimline HQs, where
everything from information technology and taxation to pensions and
purchasing is 'outsourced' to external suppliers.
The two-volume study, which was conducted by the Ashridge Strategic
Management Centre* among 107 companies with between 2,000 and 200,000
employees, suggests that some 'corporate centres' - the fashionable term for
HQs - are costing more than 1 per cent of sales. That often represents more
than 10 per cent of pre-tax profits.
The obvious implication is that every company - not just large
multinationals with HQs costing more than Pounds 300m a year - should
scrutinise carefully the size, scope and operations of its head office.
But HQ reviews should not just concentrate on cost-cutting, emphasise the
authors of the report, David Young and Michael Goold. The aim should be much
more ambitious: to increase the value which the centre adds to the company
as a whole. To do this, they argue, head office activities should be
tailored more effectively to the company's particular strategy, structure,
business portfolio, and top management style. In most cases that will mean
further cutbacks, but in some it will involve an increase.
The Ashridge team's other findings include:
That the head offices of financial services companies tend to be three times
as large as for consumer or industrial companies. This is partly because
most do not distinguish clearly between HQ functions and services to their
businesses.
That, even after some cutbacks, the HQs of privatised companies are, on
average, six times as large as for others. Young and Goold attribute this
partly to their traditionally centralised way of operating, but also say
that such companies have yet to experience real external pressure.
That 'outsourcing' is less widely practised than all the hype would suggest,
although it is certainly increasing; nor has it necessarily led to a
reduction in cost.
That the shifting of corporate centre staff out into operating businesses,
or to separate service units, may often be a sensible way of subjecting them
to market pressures.
And that companies should 'benchmark' their head offices against others, but
only with care. A company with a relatively integrated - or interdependent -
set of businesses, similar to Shell, should not try to model itself on one
with businesses that share few linkages, such as BTR. The former may need a
sizeable head office, the latter a mere skeleton.
Surprisingly, only two HQ functions are common to all 107 companies
surveyed: financial reporting and control; and company secretarial/legal.
Only four others exist in the HQs of over 80 per cent of multi-business
companies: treasury; taxation; pensions/pay administration; and 'strategic
development' - a term used to cover economic analysis and forecasting,
strategic planning, and mergers and acquisitions.
By contrast, less than half the HQs in the survey include such functions as
property services, recruitment, industrial relations, research and
development, and purchasing. Some companies define such activities as lying
outside HQ - a variation in definition which limits the survey's value
somewhat.
The idea that companies need to increase the value of their head offices,
rather than simply cut costs, is shared by most which have recently slimmed
them. But this does not mean that their redesigns came easily; outside
pressure was often required. Nor have many reviews been adequate the first
time around.
For instance, ICI cut its HQ a decade ago, only for the numbers to creep up
again through the rosy 1980s. The sudden threat of takeover by Hanson in
1991 then prompted the chemical company to split itself into two, and in the
process take a more radical look at the role of HQs than it had done before.
Trevor Harrison, who has just retired as head of planning at ICI, agrees
that 'we ought to understand more about the value a head office adds - I got
very interested in that when Hanson was around'. The traditional view that
'the role of any HQ is to support the board' is no longer adequate, he adds.
Unilever is showing signs of a more rapid rethink. In February it unveiled a
redesign and slimming of its HQ which was so limited - just 10 per cent -
that it drew catcalls from investors in the City of London. 'One of the less
successful aspects was our mismanagement of expectations,' admits Michael
Fox, who headed the review team.
'I don't believe we've got it right,' he adds. Its HQ 'will be subject to
continual review - none of the posts in it is guaranteed for over a year'.
But he stresses that 'it's not a numbers game - it's a question of ensuring
that the centre serves the businesses'.
Another instance of a company reviewing - and cutting - its HQ several times
in quick succession came to light at a conference this month organised
jointly by Ashridge and the Strategic Planning Society. Humfrey Smeeton, a
director of Ocean, described what he called the 'balls-aching detail' of a
two-stage process by which the industrial services group has reduced its
head office by more than half, to 62 people, over the past 14 months.
One of the sparks for Ocean was a 'ready reckoner' which Ashridge has
produced to help companies make quick comparisons between the size of their
head offices. It gives different weightings by company size, sector and
geographic spread. As Ocean found, it concentrates the mind wonderfully.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (7): Seven lean years - Hilary Barnes, how
the banks weathered the storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danish banks have come through a seven-year recession with their
financial integrity intact and, in contrast to the situation in the other
Nordic countries, the state has not had to provide either capital or
guarantees to keep the banking sector afloat.
The reasons, said Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive of the country's largest
bank, Den Danske Bank, who is also chairman of the Danish Banker's
Association, is sound legislation and a very thorough bank inspectorate.
'Compared with what happened in Norway, Sweden and Finland, Danish banks
have fared very well indeed,' he said.
But in a country which still has about 180 banks and savings banks (many of
them tiny) to serve 5.1m people, dozens of banks have closed over the past
10 years. In most cases the process has been fairly painless. Other banks
have taken over banks whose capital adequacy has fallen below the legal
minimum (nine per cent currently, falling to eight per cent in 1995).
Depositors (covered by an insurance scheme for deposits of up to DKr250,000)
have not lost their money, although in several cases shareholders have. 'The
banking community takes pride in finding solutions which do not involve
direct state aid,' said Mr Sorensen. But resistance by healthy banks to
saving their weaker brethren is growing.
'After a number of years when we have had to set aside considerable sums to
cover losses, willingness and capability to assist is rather limited,' said
Mr Sorensen. 'We have reached a stage where it is hard to justify to your
own shareholders, staff and customers that you have to support banks which
have taken too many risks. We will do a lot out of responsibility to
society, but there is a limit.'
Whether this limit has been definitively reached is something which only
time can tell, and the matter may not be put to serious test in the
immediate future as this year has favoured the banks, which suffered a
combined loss of DKr10.9bn in 1992. Rising bond and share prices have
boosted investment income, and cost cutting and lower interest rates have
contributed to better operating margins.
All the big banks, Danske, Unibank, Bikuben and Jyske Bank, were back in the
black in the first half. 'The present situation in Danish banking is not
that bad. We look forward with some optimism to 1994 and 1993 should be a
fairly good year,' said Mr Sorensen.
The difficulty of rescuing troubled banks was highlighted this autumn by the
case of Himmerlandsbanken, a small bank serving the North Jutland town of
Hobro, where it had a market share of around 40 per cent. The bank
collapsed. Shareholders and bondholders lost their money, but the bank was
enabled to keep going when it was taken over by Sparekassen Nordjylland
(Spar Nord), the North Jutland savings bank, after some hard persuasion by
the government.
Spar Nord believes it received a promise from the government that in return
for preventing the closure of Himmerland, Spar Nord could make a tax loss
deduction of DKr173m. But when muck-raking politicians began questioning the
legality of the deduction, the government denied having made the promise.
The case came close to costing the minister for revenue, Mr Ole Stavad, a
Social Democrat, his job, and it may yet do so. A judicial inquiry has been
set up to look into the misunderstanding and Mr Stavad's political life is
on the line. Himmerland has been accused of trying to save itself by selling
bonds in the bank with money lent to its customers for the purpose, and
without the risks being properly explained to investors.
As a consequence, the government has tabled legislation which will make it
illegal for a bank, from the moment that a bond issue is announced, to offer
to finance investment in the bonds. With many banks needing to replace
bond-financed subordinated (tier 2) capital with new loans in order to meet
the requirements of BIS capital adequacy rules, the events at
Himmerlandsbanken and the political reaction to it have come at a bad moment
for the banks.
'Right now is not the best climate in which to raise capital,' said Mr
Sorensen. 'But things will calm down again. One should not draw the
conclusion from Himmerlandsbanken that other banks will not be able to
refinance.'
Meanwhile, attempts are being made to find a solution to a problem at Varde
Bank, which serves the west coast port of Esbjerg, the country's 10th
largest bank with assets of about DKr11bn. Despite a capital restructuring
in 1992, when the Central Bank and a consortium of larger banks guaranteed
the bank's capital and liquidity, the bank's capital adequacy ratio has
slipped below the legal minimum again and action to save the bank is
imminent.
'I can only say that we shall try to adopt the most sensible solution,' said
Mr Sorensen.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (6): Architect of a new structure -
Profile / Peter Zobel, a power in the insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danish insurance industry is undergoing a process of recovery after the
shocks of 1992, when the country's second largest insurance group, Hafnia,
collapsed and the largest group, Baltica, came close to suffering the same
fate.
The man who has emerged as the architect of the restructuring of the
industry is Mr Peter Zobel, chief executive of Codan, a company founded by
Mr Zobel's family but in which the UK's Sun Alliance is now the dominant
shareholder.
Undaunted by the fact that Hafnia was twice the size of Codan, Mr Zobel made
a successful bid for Hafnia in March this year, turning Codan into the
country's largest accident insurance group (Baltica remains larger in life
assurance).
A few months later he put his stamp on the industry once more by announcing
that premiums throughout the industry were far too low. Codan, he said,
would be putting them up by an average of 15 per cent in 1994.
The other large companies, several of which had recently promised the public
that they were not even dreaming about premium increases, all agreed within
days that Mr Zobel was right.
They are following Codan's example. For many years Codan has enjoyed the
best profitability in the Danish industry, but it was first following the
mess which Baltica and Hafnia made of their businesses that Mr Zobel was
able to stamp his mark on the industry.
Baltica and Hafnia were both brought to their knees by a series of
investments which turned out to be unwise and cripplingly expensive. In
Hafnia's case, strategic share investments in Baltica itself and Sweden's
big insurer, Skandia, caused the problems. When the price of the shares in
these two companies collapsed in 1992, Hafnia Holding, the group's parent
company, was bankrupted.
Property investments were the straws which broke Baltica's back, but while
Hafnia Holding was bankrupted and the insurance operations taken over by
Codan, Baltica was successfully reconstructed. Its insurance business, which
as such has never been in trouble, has continued as before under a new
management headed by Mr Hans Eivind Hansen, formerly co-chief executive at
Den Danske Bank.
Codan's excellent profits record was based on the principle that profits are
more important than market shares; it left others to grow poorer by
fulfilling their ambitions to become the biggest. Codan led a comfortable
existence and its shareholders were well rewarded.
'We didn't have to do it,' said Mr Zobel, reflecting on the acquisition of
Hafnia, 'but when you have the money available you have to take the chance.
After all, if you don't use the money you have, you might as well shut up
shop.'
Having bought Hafnia, Codan was not forced to undertake the merger of the
two companies, but there were good reasons for undertaking the merger,
according to Mr Zobel.
There are cost reductions to be made (a staff reduction of about 10 per cent
is under way) and the companies have similar customer profiles and
strategies, even if there was a profitability gap.
The starting point for the two companies was this: in total premium income
(life and accident) Codan's was DKr2.1bn to Hafnia's Dkr5.1bn; Codan had
1,069 staff to Hafnia's 2,452; but Codan's equity capital was DKr4.8bn to
Hafnia's DKr66m.
Together, the assets of the group are about DKr50bn and its market share is
15 per cent in accident business, 21 per cent in industrial insurance (70
per cent in marine and energy), and 12 per cent in life assurance and
pension savings.
Mr Zobel's aim is to make the two companies into a single business, both
inwardly and outwardly, within one year, which means by the summer of 1994,
creating a firm in which profitability and financial soundness have
priority.
Mr Zobel, 57, does not waste words. He speaks in short, crisp sentences, a
manner which does nothing to belie his reputation as a tough cookie, who
does not suffer fools, let alone incompetent managers, gladly.
The deliberation and speed with which he is carrying through the merger only
reinforce this reputation.
All the main management and personnel were in their new positions in the
organisation within four months of the acquisition. In the final months of
1993 the superfluous members of the staff were being identified, conversion
of the computer systems was under way, the staff associations (trade unions)
were being reorganised to fit the new corporate structure.
In the first half of 1994 new products will be introduced, the conversion of
the data processing systems is due for completion and increases in premiums
will be implemented.
The reorganisation may not have been simple, but, says Mr Zobel, it is
nothing compared with the difficulty of eliminating the cultural differences
and the them-and-us syndrome - 'a hell of a problem,' he says bluntly.
Codan is known for a strong team spirit, an image built up over many years,
and, says Mr Zobel, not a man to hide his light under a bushel, 'it is to
some extent me'.
One of the problems which has emerged is that Codan's managers, who have
been put into most of the senior positions, have suddenly found themselves
running a department which is three times as large as the one they were used
to running. 'They have been used to having a finger on everything the
department did, and they have yet to realise you can't run a bigger
department in the same way,' said an anonymous manager from the Hafnia side
of the firm.
In the end the success of the acquisition and merger will have to be judged
by long-term results. This year has been a reasonably satisfactory year for
the insurance companies, which, with bond and share prices rising strongly,
made excellent returns on their financial investments, but the substantial
'insurance-technical' losses of recent years have persisted.
Mr Zobel is hoping to turn the corner in 1994, when premiums will go up.
Some loss of market shares as Codan's profitability is re-established will
not disturb him. By 1995, he hopes that the group's results will be
satisfactory.
The market seems to share Mr Zobel's optimism. Codan's share price was
maintained, indeed increased slightly, following the acquisition of the
loss-making and impoverished Hafnia and the Codan share remains the most
expensive of the insurance shares listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (9): Currency crossfire - Exports stumble
after five years of growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a dismal, and atypical, year for Danish exporters. Since a
squeeze was put on domestic demand in 1986, exports have shown exemplary
growth, increasing by 5 - 6 per cent a year until this year, when they have
fallen by about seven per cent in value and 4 - 5 per cent in volume terms.
The Danes were suddenly rendered uncompetitive in some of their main markets
by devaluations last year by European countries accounting in all for about
36 per cent of the country's merchandise exports. At the same time, the
German market, which accounts for about 24 per cent of Denmark's merchandise
exports, went into recession.
The Swedish krona has depreciated by 26 per cent against the Danish krone
over the past year. Sweden accounted in 1992 for 10.6 per cent of Denmark's
merchandise exports. In the first half of this year exports to Sweden fell
by 16 per cent.
Exports to the UK, accounting for about nine per cent of 1992 exports, were
down by 18 per cent, although sterling has recovered most of its value
against the krone since the autumn of 1992.
The trade-weighted value of the krone this winter is back to the level of
summer 1992, before the European Monetary System was rocked by currency
speculation, but the statistical average is small consolation for those who
export to Sweden or compete with her in third markets.
However, voices calling for devaluation have been few and far between and
they received no support from the leading business organisations or from
either the government or the opposition. Denmark spent a decade after 1982,
when a Conservative-led government took office after a long period of Social
Democratic domination, proving that it is committed to low inflation and a
stable currency.
When the European Monetary System to all intents and purposes collapsed in
August this year, the government sought to avoid a significant depreciation
of the krone. The Central Bank maintained the average value of the krone
unchanged against the Ecu, and after an initial weakening against the
D-mark, with the exchange rate going from DKr3.88 to 4.14, the krone has
strengthened again recently to a rate of around DKr3.96.
Danish exports are geographically concentrated on neighbouring markets, with
some 75 per cent going to EC and Efta countries. In products terms,
manufactures are about 75 per cent of merchandise exports and agricultural
exports for about 18 per cent. But the food industry is more important than
figures suggest.
With fish, processed fish products, sugar, and machinery, equipment and
other inputs for the food industry (and not forgetting farmed mink pelts,
where Denmark is a world leader), the total food and agricultural sector
accounts for well over a quarter of the country's exports. The EU's
agricultural policy reforms and the Gatt reforms (not yet agreed, of course)
will hit agriculture hard, cutting the value of agricultural production by
about 10 per cent, according to Danish government calculations.
Dairy exports will be hit especially badly, but pigmeat is one of the
products which will suffer least from the reforms, which is a Danish
advantage: pigmeat accounts for about eight per cent of total exports and 45
per cent of agricultural exports.
Despite the troubled future for agriculture in the medium term, there is no
inclination on the part of the government or the agro-industrial sector
itself to write off the agricultural and food industries. On the contrary, a
report this autumn by the Ministry for Business Policy Coordination
identified the food and food technology industries as one of the segments in
which Denmark has a strong competitive advantage with an accumulated
know-how.
A report to the government by the Institute for Food Studies and
Agro-industrial Development in 1992 claimed that the value of
agro-industrial production could be doubled over the next 20 years.
While the government does not necessarily accept the report's conclusions,
it has shown its commitment to the agro-industrial industries through the
Food Industry Technology research programme. Government and industry on a
50-50 basis together put about DKr800m into the programme over the period
1990-94 and plan to invest DKr1bn over the next five years in stage two of
the programme, which is by far the largest Danish government-funded
programme ot its type.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (4): Fog in the middle distance - Economic
optimism is very tentative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES

<TEXT>
The government and private forecasters are in agreement that in 1994 there
will be a return to economic growth after seven years of near-stagnation,
culminating with a year of zero or perhaps even negative growth in 1993.
As regards the longer term, however, the views of the government and the
business community diverge.
In a recently-published medium-term outlook, the government foresees an
average annual increase in gross domestic product between 1995 and 2000 of
3.3 per cent, with private sector production increasing even faster, at
about four per cent a year.
But the business community fears that a return to growth will be inhibited
by serious structural rigidities in the economy. 'The government doesn't
seem to see the structural problems, but we do,' said Mr Hans Skov
Christensen, the director-general of the Federation of Danish Industries,
who suspects, too, that European recovery will have a different character
than previous post-war recoveries.
Demand will strengthen in West Europe, but much of the increase in
production which this generates will take place in East Europe, where wage
costs are only about one tenth, or less, of wage costs in countries such as
Denmark. 'We shall not see the same kind of international boom we used to
see,' he said.
However, Denmark, says the government, has a better starting point for
sustained, non-inflationary growth than most other European countries. It
has a surplus on trade in goods and services which is almost seven per cent
of GDP (not even Japan can beat that) and a surplus on the current balance
of payments account of just over three per cent of GDP.
Inflation is the lowest in Europe at just 1.2 per cent over the 12 months to
September. Hourly wage rates have increased by only about two per cent this
year, and after the trauma of speculative attacks on the krone in the spring
and again in July this year, which forced the Central Bank to raise interest
rates sharply, interest rates are rapidly coming down to average European
levels again.
Government finances are in deficit, showing the effects of the long
recession and high unemployment, but the general government financial
deficit this year will be about 4.4 per cent of GDP, which is below the
average for the EU.
The strong external position is being exploited by the government to give a
substantial boost to domestic demand via fiscal policy in 1994, when Mr
Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister, estimates that the stimulus to GDP
growth from fiscal policy will be about 1.3 per cent.
The fiscal boost will come more particularly from a reform of the tax
system, passed by the Folketing last summer. This reduces the country's
exceptionally high marginal income tax rates (the top rate will go down from
68 to about 62 per cent and the bottom rate from 51 to 43 per cent). The
revenue lost on income tax will not be clawed back in 1994, although higher
energy and other 'green' taxes will equalise the revenue loss by 1998, when
the reform will be fully implemented.
The government expects the boost to demand to lead to a surge in real
private consumption by almost 4 per cent and a 2.9 per cent increase in GDP
next year. Other forecasters are more cautious, but agree that demand will
rise significantly. The Industries Federation, for example, predicts a GDP
growth of 2.5 per cent and increase in private consumption of 3.0 per cent.
The upswing will generate a few extra jobs, but neither the government nor
other forecasters expect unemployment to fall by more than about 20,000 to
around 330,000 from 350 000, or 12.5 per cent (seasonally adjusted), this
autumn.
Mr Lykketoft's medium-term report emphasises that after 1994 fiscal policy
must switch to containing the government deficit in order to ensure a
sustained low real rate of interest, a necessary condition of obtaining
strong growth in the business sector.
In the same report, Mr Lykketoft's ministry asserts that marginal changes in
minimum wage levels and the country 's high unemployment benefits (benefit
is 90 per cent of wages up to a ceiling which is 90 per cent of the average
wage for skilled workers) will not have a significant effect on demand for
labour, and drastic changes 'are not acceptable in a society of the Danish
kind,' as Mr Lykketoft told the FT.
For Mr Skov Christensen, however, what is at stake is not the social welfare
system. 'This has to do with survival,' he said. Without action on minimum
wages, the steady increase in transfer incomes (between 24 and 25 per cent
of the population aged 16-66 live off transfer incomes now) will both
undermine government finances and export-competitiveness.
The Danish Employer's Association, the sister organisation to the Federation
of Industries, put some figures on what it regards as necessary if more jobs
are to be generated for the less skilled population groups. The generous
transfer incomes - such as unemployment benefits - which currently place a
floor on the hourly wage rate of DKr67, must be reduced to that the minimum
wage can fall to DKr50, it said.
At that level, the Danish minimum wage would be just eight times the average
wage in Poland.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (3): Roads over northern waters - Hugh
Carnegy describes the scope of Europe's biggest bridge building programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Denmark is a small country, its scattered landmass of islands and
the Jutland peninsula has always meant that any non-air journey between the
main centres required at least one ferry crossing. By the end of the decade,
however, that will have changed.
Within the next four years a DKr20bn project to build a bridge and tunnel
between the islands of Zeeland and Funen is set to be completed, providing
for the first time a direct road and rail link between the capital
Copenhagen and the country's other main centres such as Odense, Esbjerg,
Arhus and Aalborg.
When construction began in 1988 of the link across the 18km-wide Storebaelt,
or Great Belt, channel, the then minister of transport, Mr H. P. Clausen,
summed up its significance: 'We will have a completely new Denmark with the
fixed link across Storebaelt. We shall no longer speak of east and west
Denmark, but of Denmark as a whole. This project will be more significant to
the population of Denmark and the business sector than any other traffic
project has ever been.'
But Storebaelt is only the first step in a series of huge bridge/tunnel
projects planned by Denmark to transform its transport links both internally
and to its neighbours.
If outstanding political obstacles are overcome, construction will begin
next year on the Oresund bridge linking Copenhagen to the Swedish city of
Malmo. Discussions have also begun with Germany and Sweden on building a
fixed link from the south eastern Danish island of Lolland, across the
Femarn straits, to Germany.
Once in place, the Oresund bridge will, in concert with Storebaelt, give
Sweden a direct land link for the first time, not just to Denmark, but to
Germany and the rest of continental Europe. This link would be made even
quicker and more direct by a Femarn bridge. Denmark expects a significant
boost to its economy from its own improved links and from increased
through-trade from Sweden to Europe.
Storebaelt has slipped about one year behind schedule chiefly because of
problems encountered while tunnelling. But the rail link, which will run for
most of the crossing in the tunnel, is due to open by 1996. The road link is
scheduled to open a year later, running across a two-stage bridge including
the world's longest single suspension bridge span of 1,624 metres.
The DKr20bn cost has been raised by the state-owned Storebaelt company
through international markets, backed by state guarantees. It will be paid
for by a commitment from the state railways to pay DKr825m a year for 30
years to use the link and from vehicle tolls.
Much greater controversy and uncertainty surrounds the Oresund link.
Although the Danish and Swedish governments signed a treaty to build it in
1991, minority parties in the two governments currently in office have
raised objections, delaying a final go-ahead for the project.
The joint Swedish-Danish consortium set up to build the combined 16.8km
road/rail tunnel and bridge link is due to invite construction tenders early
next year. But, on the Swedish side, the Centre party, which holds the
environment portfolio in the government, is continuing to object chiefly on
environmental grounds, despite support for the project from the coalition
leaders, the Moderate party, and the main opposition Social Democrats.
In Denmark, the Radical Liberal party is objecting on the grounds that the
cost of the project is unlikely to be met by the planned method of
repayment. The budgeted cost of the link is DKr17bn, including DKr12bn for
the tunnel and bridge, DKr3bn in land costs on the Danish side and DKr2bn on
the Swedish side.
The consortium concedes that these costs are likely to rise by up to DKr700m
as a result of construction strictures demanded by Sweden's Water Rights
Court this month to ensure the environmental impact of the bridge is
minimised, particularly on the sensitive subject of impeding vital salt
water flows into the already badly polluted Baltic.
The pay back on the costs is scheduled to come from DKr300m a year shared by
the Danish and Swedish state railways and the rest to be raised in vehicle
tolls. But the project's backers have run into something of a Catch-22.
Their financial plans rely on a rather modest estimate of 10,000 vehicle
crossings per day.
More vehicle crossings would raise the toll income, but the two governments
are under pressure not to break international undertakings on exhaust
emissions by allowing excessive traffic on the bridge.
Mr Henning Hummelmose, the chief executive of the Oresund company,
nevertheless believes the project will go ahead. 'I think we have reached
the point of no return. I don't think that the environmental questions or
the financial questions can stop the project. So much political prestige has
been invested that it must go through.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (5): A rare change of command - Profile /
A. P. Moller, Denmark's top company, has a new boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AP Moller, the discreetly-run, strangely-structured shipping group that is
Denmark's biggest business concern, has this year undergone a change in
chief executive for only the second time in its near 90 year history.
On the eve of his 80th birthday in July, Mr Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller stepped
aside from the day-to-day running of the group founded in 1904 and headed
until the 1960s by his father, the late Mr AP Moller.
Into his shoes stepped Mr Jess Soderberg, 49, who assumed the task of
leading an enterprise with total annual turnover of some DKr50bn across a
range of businesses spanning shipping, shipbuilding, oil and gas, air
transport and retailing.
But although the chief executive is no longer a member of the controlling
family, few people inside or outside the Moller empire expect dramatic
shifts to follow the change at the top. 'Although the skipper has changed,
there has been no change in the crew and we remain on the same heading,'
said a Moller executive unable to resist a seafaring metaphor.
Indeed, Mr Mc-Kinney Moller has not left the scene. He remains chairman of
the group's twin parent companies D/S Svendborg and D/S 1912 (both
controlled by the Moller family) and the boards of key companies within the
group. 'I will stay informed  .. I will often be in this building, although
in another office,' he told staff at Moller's Copenhagen headquarters when
he handed over to Mr Soderberg.
Analysts in Copenhagen seem reassured by Mr Mc-Kinney Moller's move,
anticipating a smooth transition under Mr Soderberg, formerly chief
financial officer. Furthermore, a reputation for being well managed has
helped deflect investor concern over the complex and arcane structure of the
Moller group, and its reluctance to speak publicly about its business.
Although the parent companies, with a market value of some DKr40bn, together
make up about one quarter of the market capitalisation of the Copenhagen
stock exchange, the AP Moller group, with 30,000 employees, does not publish
consolidated accounts. This is because of its structure under which AP
Moller itself is an unlisted partnership.
The parent companies have kept to a minimum the information they must
publish by avoiding share issues which would require a detailed prospectus.
In the 89-year history of the group, the only issue by the parent companies
was a bonus issue in 1973.
But there is no arguing with the share performance. They have surged by some
50 per cent this year, with D/S Svendborg B shares fetching a cool
DKr170,000 each. The market's judgment is clearly that AP Moller's
businesses are, in the words of an analyst, 'in good health'.
This is despite a nasty slide in profits in 1992 in the shipping business.
The dominant Tankers and Liners in Partnership unit saw net profits tumble
to DKr1.05bn from DKr1.5bn, on slightly reduced turnover of DKr19.5bn - and
the figures were worse after transfers from the parent companies were
excluded.
Analysts put most of this down to weakness in the worldwide shipping market.
They believe Moller's evolution over the past 15 years into the world's
leading container carrier will pay off when the cycle turns up again.
Moller has continued to invest heavily throughout the recession, this year
ordering five ships from its own Odense Steel Shipyard capable of carrying
4,800 standard 20-ft containers. It has established a number of 'hub'
container terminals around the world allowing it to develop an integrated
north-south and east-west route network with extensive onshore services,
including container trains in the US and Europe.
Moller has also recently returned to building and operating VLCC (very large
crude carrier) oil tankers. It has ordered six 300,000-tonne double-hulled
tankers, three of which have already been built, from Odense. These were the
first of their type to be built in the world as Moller seeks to cash in on
new marine regulations on 'environmentally-friendly' tankers that are
designed to be resistant to puncture.
However, the element in AP Moller which increasingly underpins group
profitability is the oil and gas division, which last year produced profits
of DKr808m on turnover of DKr3.3bn. The group has a 39 per cent share in
Danish Underground Consortium, the sole operator of Denmark's North Sea oil
and gas. This year DUC signed a contract with the state to double gas
deliveries to 7bn cubic metres a year from 1997. 'Forty per cent of Moller
profits will come from oil and gas in the long term,' said a Copenhagen
analyst. 'That is the cash cow.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (2): Jobs are the biggest issue - Politics
/ Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister, outlines the principal objectives of
his Social Democrat-led government in an interview with Hugh Carnegy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was sworn in as Denmark's prime minister on
January 25 this year, his elevation capped a meteoric rise through the
political ranks by the former trade union economist.
A member of parliament since only 1988, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen took over at the
head of the Social Democratic party in 1992 in a controversial but
successful challenge to the leadership of Mr Svend Auken. Within nine
months, the resignation of the Conservative-led coalition of Mr Poul
Schluter, which fell after 10 years in office amidst a scandal over the
treatment of Tamil refugees, allowed the 49-year-old Mr Nyrup Rasmussen to
form his own coalition with the small Radical Liberal, Centre Democrat and
Christian People's parties.
With the aura more of a technocrat than a politician, he has sometimes
seemed ill at ease in the prime ministerial hot seat. But once over the
hurdle of last May's second referendum on the Maastricht Treaty establishing
the European Union, he has waxed in confidence.
In a conversation with the FT, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen discussed the principal
political challenge facing his government - how to tackle the double digit
rate of unemployment while simultaneously fulfilling the Social Democratic
pledge to defend and sustain Denmark's highly developed welfare state.
'You should never forget that our unemployment rate is caused firstly by the
lowest business cycle comeback we have had for many, many years,' he says.
'We have not been in such a situation since the end of the 1950s. That is
why I say that time is working for the government in that the economic
growth rate is coming up now. Our so-called economic wise men evaluate that
we will succeed in 1994 in forcing the unemployment curve down again. But it
is a very long job. We can force it down in 1994 but it takes years to
reinforce employment.'
A big fiscal stimulus next year and a range of measures such as job rotation
and job-sharing have been adopted by the government. But the prime minister
firmly rejects the notion that the long term solution to unemployment lies
in radical restructuring of Denmark's labour market, with its high jobless
benefits and high minimum wage levels.
'I don't believe a bit in that argument, for many reasons. One is that it is
not well documented that relatively high unemployment benefits have been a
barrier to obtain jobs for the lower paid. I believe fundamentally in adult
education and training as the way to go. In my mind the debate about
competition between the unemployment benefit rate and the minimum wage is
not relevant in this country.'
At the European level, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen talks of a 'New Deal' initiative
by the EU to increase Europe's commitment to education, research and
development and labour flexibility. But, again, he is suspicious of calls
for deep, free-market reforms.
'There is no connection directly in the different countries between the
degree of regulation - be it by law, be it by collective agreements - and
the unemployment rate. So when it comes to making the labour market more
flexible, it seems difficult to develop a European strategy which covers the
significant differences in the different member countries.
'Spain is perhaps the most well documented single example of structural
problems directly related to regulations on the labour market - but if you
take the UK you see that the unemployment rate is very high but the
regulation degree is very low. So it is not that simple.'
The recent rise in popularity of the Liberal opposition party, which calls
for just such structural reforms, has sharpened the domestic political
debate in Denmark in recent months. Local elections and opinion polls have
suggested a polarisation of support around the Social Democrats on the one
hand, and the Liberals, led by the energetic Mr Uffe Elleman Jensen, the
former foreign minister, on the other.
If the trend hardened, it could lead to the marginalisation of the handful
of small parties that have traditionally held the balance of power in
Denmark - and could deprive the Social Democrats of vital coalition support.
Mr Nyrup Rasmussen is therefore keen to stress the merits of Denmark's
consensus tradition.
'This trend is not preferable because the tradition here is to have a
plurality of political parties. So I would regard it as a serious loss in
political life if this trend became stronger. We have always based ourselves
upon talking together and listening together. This country was the first
country of all - in September 1899 - to create a consensus on the labour
market, with the first independent labour court, with the first place where
you establish collective agreements. This country still has the lowest
potential conflict degree in the labour market. It is an inbuilt factor in
the explanation of our welfare society.'

large-scale public works. Its Social Democrat-led coalition is also pledged
to keep taxes low and to protect the country's cherished welfare state

After a heady year in the international headlines, Denmark is facing grim
reality again.
A referendum in May to accept the Maastricht Treaty creating the European
Union, reversing a dramatic initial rejection in June 1992, brought to an
end a period in which the country had enjoyed unaccustomed levels of
attention as it held the future of the community in its hands.
Now, just as Denmark has slipped down the European agenda, so has the issue
of Europe been supplanted at home by the more mundane but daunting problems
of a faltering economy, an unemployment rate of some 12 per cent of the
workforce and the strains these have placed on the country's
highly-developed welfare state.
Nor are more cheerful diversions in view: earlier this month, the Danish
football team failed to qualify for next summer's World Cup Finals in the
US, shattering the national euphoria which followed its unexpected victory
in the European championship a few weeks after the first Maastricht
referendum.
In tune with the change in mood, the four-party coalition of Prime Minister
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, led by his Social Democratic Party, has made the
regeneration of economic growth and 'bending down the curve' of unemployment
the over-riding aim of the govern ment.
The government, which includes the Centre Democratic Party, the Radical
Liberal Party and the Christian People's Party, took office in January
following the collapse of a Conservative-Liberal coalition led by Mr Poul
Schluter. Mr Schluter had held together a non-socialist government for 10
years but was finally forced to resign in the face of a scandal over the
treatment of a group of Tamil refugees in which he was found by a judicial
inquiry to have misled the Folketing (parliament).
With Denmark at the time holding the presidency of the European Community,
Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's initial priority was to ensure the approval of
Maastricht in the second referendum, held after Denmark won a series of
opt-outs from the treaty's provisions at the EC's December summit in
Edinburgh. But the Social Democrats, many of whose own supporters were
anti-Maastricht, had no special enthusiasm for the loftier goals of European
Union.
Since the referendum was won, the government has been happy to let slip the
issues of institutional reform within the EU, preferring not to return to
them in earnest until the next Intergovernmental Conference in 1996.
Instead, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen has advocated that the EU concentrate on the
issues that are also his chief domestic concern - how to engender growth and
tackle unemployment.
At home, the change in government did not produce any change in Denmark's
dogged determination to maintain the value of the krone as an anchor that
has helped achieve an inflation rate of just over one per cent. Although
granted exemption from the goal of European Monetary Union under the
Edinburgh accords, the coalition is committed to making the krone a core
currency when new arrangements for the European Monetary System are
eventually made.
In spite of repeated speculative buffetings during Europe's currency
turbulence of the past year, and some damage to exports, Mr Nyrup
Rasmussen's government has spurned the devaluation route taken by Sweden and
the UK, two of Denmark's most important export markets and competitors.
The krone was one of the currencies given a wider 15 per cent ERM band in
August, but has since fallen relatively little against the D-Mark and
interest rates have fallen to their lowest levels in two decades. But the
coalition has struck out on a markedly different economic path from its
predecessor.
Backed by a large current account surplus and a low budget deficit, the
government has adopted a policy - at least temporarily - of fiscal
expansion. In the summer it enacted Denmark's most far-reaching tax reforms
for decades, cutting the top rate of income tax over the next five years
from 68 per cent to about 63 per cent and the lowest rate from about 51 per
cent to 43 per cent. These will be partly financed by 'green taxes' on
energy, water and packaging. Coupled with a boost to public spending,
targetted on infrastructural pro jects, the measures will inject a projected
DKr12bn into the economy next year, equivalent to 1.2 per cent of gross
domestic product.
This will inflate the budget deficit to about six per cent of GDP. But the
government estimates it will push up GDP growth to 2.9 per cent in 1994 and
start to achieve the target of turning round the relentless rise of
unemployment.
At the same time, the coalition has pledged to defend and improve the
welfare state, firmly rejecting the opposition argument that Denmark's high
benefits and minimum wage levels are a barrier to employment growth. The
government's approach has been to set up job-sharing and job-rotation
schemes and to look to the extension of education and retraining but not to
attack not the wage and benefits structure.
'The welfare state gives a security that makes people less afraid of
changes. We really don't believe we would be better off with lower
benefits,' says Ms Karen Jespersen, the minister for social affairs. The
government parties are betting that this approach will be popular with
voters and will pay off when the next general election is held, probably in
the autumn of 1994.
The Social Democrats in particular have placed their faith in Denmark's
traditional consensus around the maintenance of the welfare state. frayed by
after the referendums.' I think people in Denmark very strongly want the
welfare state,' says Ms Jespersen. 'Of course there is a dilemma when people
call for tax cuts. But Danes accept you have to pay taxes to sustain the
welfare system.'
A better-than-expected performance by the Social Democrats in this month's
local elections was seen within the party as evidence that it is on the
right track. But it is facing sharp opposition from the centre-right
opposition, spearheaded by the Liberal Party under Mr Uffe Ellemann Jensen,
the fiery former foreign minister.
The Liberals have shot up in popularity since the change of government,
notably among younger voters, overtaking the Conservatives in the opinion
polls as the main opposition party. The party made easily the biggest gains
in the local elections. The Liberal aim is to achieve a Folketing majority
with the Conservatives and the right-wing Progress Party at the general
election.
Although clearly wary of stepping outside the 'welfare consensus', it
insists that the government is ducking vital structural reforms in the
economy, has over-estimated its growth projections and risks pitching the
country into a financial crisis such as it experienced in the early 1980s.
Mr Ellemann Jensen says the government has not grasped the seriousness of
the threat to west European competitiveness from Asian economies and more
especially from the low-cost emerging economies of central and eastern
Europe. Beyond domestic economic policy, he is also sharply critical of the
government for not playing a more active role in preparing the EU to meet
this challenge. 'Jobs are moving to the east - and they should be allowed to
move to the east. But we have to accept the changes in our systems this
calls for. We are reaching the point where the welfare system and the public
sector risk tipping the boat.'
These arguments find a strong echo in the industrial community. Mr Hans Skov
Christensen, head of the Federation of Danish Industries, points out that
the average wage in Poland of DKr6 per hour is under a 10th of the minimum
wage of DKr65 per hour in Denmark. 'We have to totally reconsider the
system,' he insists. 'We need more wage flexibility to keep production here
in areas where we are better, we need to improve the service sector and we
need much more ambitious research and development efforts.'
The signs are that Danish voters will be presented with a sharper choice of
policy alternatives than they have been accustomed to when the election
comes around. But if the coalition can indeed bend down the unemployment
curve next year while sustaining the welfare state at present levels, the
electorate is unlikely to prefer the harsher medicine prescribed by the
opposition.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Tips on tipping at the table in
London - Nicholas Lander offers an answer to a perennial riddle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How big a tip should you leave in a UK restaurant? Many British diners are
unsure and visitors from countries with fixed service charges are often
completely bewildered.
There is no uniformity to the service charges in UK restaurants.
Restaurateurs offer a bewildering set of options at the bottom of their
bills.
These fall into four main categories:
Prices include service and VAT. In the UK, all menu prices include VAT by
law. But the phrase 'service and VAT included', the one most commonly used
in the rest of Europe, usually appears only in hotel restaurants and coffee
shops and the most expensive restaurants.
Even in the latter, pay attention. One of London's finest restaurants, La
Tante Claire, quotes service inclusive prices but then, when you pay with a
credit card, incorporates the latter at the top of the slip but leaves the
service box empty making it very easy for you to pay the service charge
twice.
This is an iniquitous habit that can prove very costly to the business
traveller.
A percentage called 'service' appears on the bottom of your bill. The
percentage must be displayed on the menu (10, 12.5 or 15 per cent). This is
an expensive system for the restaurateur because National Insurance
contributions have to be paid on this additional amount. For this reason it
is usually replaced by
'Optional service charge'. A misleading phrase because you are often left
feeling that it is not optional at all. It has been criticised by the
Department of Trade and Industry but is sadly only too common.
'Service charge is not included, gratuities at the customers' discretion'.
This is the phrase used by a large number of restaurants and one that
creates confusion and embarrassment for the customer.
Whichever system is adopted, almost every UK restaurant today pools all tips
and service charges and then shares them out on a points system (based on
experience and ability) to the waiting staff via their wage packets.
There is no advantage in leaving cash other than in small restaurants or as
an extra appreciation of excellent service.
Many restaurants are trying to raise the service charge to 15 per cent but
this, unless the service is exceptional, is excessive. If service is
optional, 12.5 per cent is an adequate reward for attentive service.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Cathay Pacific closes door on
latecomers - Daniel Green reports on an airline's pursuit of punctuality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers leaving Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific should consult their watches
more closely than usual. The carrier has introduced a 'doors close on time'
policy in an effort to reduce the number of late departures suffered by just
about every airline at the crowded airport.
The principle is that the check-in desk closes half an hour before scheduled
departure. The gate shuts with 10 minutes to go.
Passengers arriving after the deadlines will not be allowed on board. Anyone
who has checked-in but not arrived at the gate 10 minutes before departure
will have their luggage taken off the aircraft - the latest computer
labelling technology allows the bags to be found quickly.
The problem Cathay is trying to solve is that delays on long-haul flights
out of Hong Hong can easily be an hour or more if the take-off slot is
missed. One late passenger can leave the other 400 people on a Boeing 747
sitting on the tarmac for an hour or more.
Left behind
'Some passengers have been lulled into feeling they can turn up at the last
minute for flights. They would not turn up like that for a bullet train from
Tokyo to Osaka, or for a theatre performance,' says Mr Tony Tyler, general
manager of Cathay Pacific Europe.
'We are going to upset some people but the silent majority will applaud us.'
The scheme's first few months of operation have seen punctuality improved
dramatically, and 300 passengers left behind in Hong Kong.
No one left at the departure gate has complained, claims Mr Tyler. He
admits, though, that some people trying to check-in less than 30 minutes
before scheduled departure were upset at being barred from the flight.
'At (Hong Kong's) Kai Tak airport, there is no way they could get from
check-in to the aircraft in time,' he explains.
Cathay may be facing a lone struggle to persuade the temporally challenged
to change their ways: British Airways, which also flies from Hong Kong, will
not be following Cathay's lead.
'We have a very good punctuality record,' insists BA. 'We see no reason to
change our policy.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Airport train finally reaches Rome's centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than three years after discovering that the city end of the rail link
between Rome's Fiumicino airport and the 'city centre' was far from central,
travellers will be pleased to learn that the service has finally penetrated
Rome's heart.
The link, built for the 1990 soccer world cup, was always a disappointment
to budget-conscious tourists, as trains stopped about a mile short of the
city centre at the suburban station of Ostiense. The obligatory taxi ride
into town added L10,000-L15,000 to the rail ticket, now L7,000 (Pounds
2.80).
That meant the journey was still only about one third the price of taking a
taxi all 16 miles from Fiumicino, but added a great deal of inconvenience.
Having to change from rail to taxi (or hike the 10 minutes to the nearest
underground stop) meant Ostiense was a drag, particularly after the popular
direct bus service from the airport to Rome's main Stazione Termini railway
terminus was suspended soon after the new rail link opened.
Ostiense also acquired an unfortunate early stigma after many taxi drivers
either boycotted the new terminal or made fictitious claims about 'rail
strikes' or 'problems on the line' to persuade passengers to continue all
the way to the airport.
Last Saturday everything changed. Now, 15 trains a day run non-stop between
Fiumicino and Rome's Stazione Termini, in the heart of town. The new
service, between 7am and 8.50pm, is costlier than its forerunner, at L12,000
one way. But the air conditioned and 1st class only coaches come as a
godsend to those wanting to avoid venal taxi drivers or rush-hour traffic.
Better still, Alitalia, Italy's state airline, has inaugurated four check-in
and ticket desks alongside Stazione Termini's platform 22, from which the
new service departs. Passengers with hand baggage only can check in on the
spot before hopping on the train for the 30-minute ride.
The only drawback with the new train is the frequency, only once an hour
each way. Italy's state railways, which has already broken new ground with
Alitalia by inaugurating new Florence-Fiumicino and Naples-Fiumicino
services, claims a more frequent schedule is impossible owing to congestion.
Meanwhile, the old rail link continues as before, though the modernistic
steel and marble air terminal at Ostiense has been closed. Travellers can
still use the Ostiense suburban station on the other side of the tracks for
the airport train. However, as it now continues to other suburban stops
before terminating at Tiburtina to the east, it may be more convenient to
alight elsewhere.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Disruption on way out of Italy -
Travel Advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian air traffic controllers are expected to strike today and tomorrow
for a couple of hours early each morning. Flights leaving Italy are likely
to be disrupted before midday, but airlines expect few delays for in-coming
journeys.
BELGIUM: Difficulties caused by the general strike last week, which involved
air traffic controllers, have now been solved. Flights of TAT, British
Airways' French regional carrier, are expected to be back to normal
following last week's delays caused by pilots' union meetings.
NIGERIA: The Foreign and Commonwealth Office says the political situation
remains uncertain. There is a high incidence of street crime and armed
robberies, especially in Lagos and southern states. Travelling outside
cities after dark is unsafe.
El SALVADOR: Although the civil war has ended, there is still lawlessness.
Many victims are being murdered in the course of robberies, especially where
they resist. Travel after dark should be avoided.
Outbreaks of cholera occur periodically. Travellers are advised to contact
the British Embassy (98-1763, 98-1769 or 98-1455) for the latest news.
CHINA: China remains generally a safe place, but muggings in the main cities
and sexual harassment are increasing. Visitors should guard their money and
valuables in public areas. Women travelling alone should be careful.
Our limited representation and the poor local communications make it hard to
guarantee quick help for citizens in difficulty outside Beijing (especially
in Tibet). Those travelling outside Beijing should make a note of the full
address, telephone and telex numbers of the British Embassy, Beijing, and
the British Consulate General, Shanghai.
MONGOLIA: Visitors travelling through or to Mongolia must have a valid visa
and register with the police authorities after their arrival.
Street crime is rising. Visitors should remain vigilant and not travel alone
off the main streets of any town. Wherever possible use regular taxis.
Domestic flight schedules are uncertain because of shortages of aviation
fuel and a lack of advance booking facilities. There are also doubts as to
aircraft safety because of poor servicing.

FT  29 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Reclaiming VAT around Europe -
Michael Skapinker looks at the obstacles to recovering taxes on business
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stay in London and you can get back the value added tax you pay on your
hotels and meals. In Amsterdam, you can claim back VAT on your hotel bill
but not on meals. In Paris you lose it all.
Anyone who believes the single market and the European Union are established
facts has never looked at the tortuous procedures business travellers have
to go through to reclaim VAT on business services.
In principle, someone travelling on business from one EU country to another
can reclaim VAT spent on certain services. The first difficulty is
establishing which services.
The UK and Germany are generous to business travellers, allowing them to
reclaim VAT expended on hotels, car rental and other transport, petrol,
meals, professional fees, conferences, trade shows and training courses.
Countries such as France, Ireland and Italy are less open-handed.
Most EU countries allow business travellers from outside the Union to
reclaim VAT. Some, like Italy, do not allow non-EU citizens to reclaim
unless their own countries offer reciprocal arrangements.
For those who have managed to understand what can be reclaimed, the
bureaucratic battle has only just begun. There is no central clearing house
for VAT reclamation. Nor does the EU have a single working language.
Applications in Denmark must be completed in Danish, in Greek in Greece and
Dutch in the Netherlands.
Even then for those who do manage to fill in the forms in the correct
language, there are traps everywhere. Among the most common is failing to
get the right invoice for services; invoices must specify what VAT was paid.
Another mistake is to have an invoice made out to the company's subsidiary
in the country in which the expense was incurred. Instead, invoices must be
made out to the company in the business traveller's home country.
Understandably, given the complications, many companies do not bother to
reclaim. They write off VAT paid in another country as part of the cost of
doing business abroad.
That was the attitude taken by management consultants Arthur D. Little until
a year ago. William Stormont, a director of the consultancy, says:
'Our travel bill was very large, but reclaiming VAT is a very labour
intensive exercise. Understanding the attitudes in each of the countries was
quite a deterrent as far as we were concerned,' he says.
The consultancy turned to Meridian Vat Reclaim, one of several companies now
specialising in making claims. In one year, Arthur D. Little has received
Pounds 4,500 back after commissions. Stormont admits it is not a fortune,
but adds that every bit helps in these difficult times.
UK Customs and Excise publishes a VAT refunds booklet called notice 723. It
is available free from HM Customs and Excise, VAT Overseas Repayments,
Custom House, PO Box 34, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, BT48 7AE.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Voters list demands for Clarke - People from a
range of backgrounds have been telling the FT what they want from the
chancellor. They will be asked tomorrow if they think he has delivered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'I vote a definite no to increases in VAT on fuel and heating. It just is
not a caring stance. Politically it sends out a signal that the government
does not care about the elderly and the poor' - keen Conservative supporter
Richard Goodall, 28, general manager of the Asda superstore in Great
Yarmouth, Norfolk.
'I understand the government is broke. It needs to raise money, the only way
it can raise money is from the people. You can guarantee after this Budget
that the government will be getting more money off the people' - Tory voter
Sean Cockburn, 22, quality manager at a plating factory in Darlington,
County Durham.
It cannot be easy for Kenneth Clarke, the populist chancellor. He will
tomorrow discover just how difficult it is to please anybody at all, not to
mention the Tory party's own supporters.
During the past few weeks a wide range of people across Britain have been
telling the Financial Times what they want from the first Budget in modern
times to combine spending and taxation. Tomorrow afternoon, we will obtain
their first reactions.
From single mother to captain of industry, each knew what they wanted.
Salaries ranged from less than Pounds 10,000 to more than Pounds 185,000 and
political affiliation was split evenly between the two main parties, except
for three Liberal Democrat supporters. The spread of opinion was wide. All
but a couple were homeowners; most had mortgages, and, apart from a
housewife and a student, all were employed. They had many views in common.
Taxation, for most, was more important than spending. This was because none
expected handouts from a Treasury that is servicing a debt of Pounds 50bn in
1993-94. None wanted an increase in the tax base or the phasing out of
existing tax breaks - anything, in fact, that might threaten a recovery.
Several concerns shone through: the repeal of Norman Lamont's phased
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel bills; for books, magazines
and children's clothes to remain exempt from VAT; for tax breaks on
investment and childcare; for lower interest rates and the retention of
mortgage interest relief. There were also many specific concerns, reflecting
among others the needs of their jobs.
Leslie Thomson, 76, is a retired Lloyd's underwriter living at Monkton
Deverill, near Warminster, Wiltshire. He votes Labour 'out of intellectual
convictions'. He says: 'I very much dislike this government's insistence on
indirect taxation and I would far rather a straightforward rise in the basic
rate of tax. This seems so much fairer all round. I do feel that VAT and
indirect taxes take no account whatsoever of people's financial situation.'
Suzana Radovic, 43, is a single mother, but resists inclusion in the
'dependent lone parent' class that the government is targeting for savings.
She is one of several dreading VAT increases.
She is an art teacher and head of year at Wimbledon College, a girls'
comprehensive, on Pounds 20,000 a year. Her five-year-old son, who attends a
state primary, is looked after by his grandmother, so she receives no state
support apart from child benefit.
'I'd like the chancellor to scrap this VAT on heating. My mother is a senior
citizen at home all day and the heating has to be on too.'
Jennie Gentles, 29, is a mature student at North London University who lives
in a two-bedroomed flat in Streatham. Her only source of income is a
maintenance grant from Croydon Borough Council, and her main outgoings are
rent and books for her social science postgraduate degree course. She has to
go without dinner for a week to pay for a vital text.
'I would hate to see VAT on books and newspapers. I can't afford course
books at the moment, VAT will make them even more inaccessible and have a
knock-on effect on my course work.'
Like Suzana Radovic, Miranda Thomas, a part-time teacher with two small
boys, wants tax breaks on childcare. But her main concern is that tax relief
on mortgage interest payments should be retained.
She and her solicitor husband bought a west London two-bedroomed flat for
Pounds 131,000 in 1990. It has just been sold for Pounds 108,000. The couple
took out a Pounds 75,000 interest-only mortgage when interest rates were 15
per cent; after paying the building society for four years, they still owe
Pounds 85,000 - more than the initial mortgage.
'We worked out that we could have lived in a penthouse in the Ritz for the
whole four years,' she says.
For a young couple waiting to buy their own first home, mortgage tax relief
is even more vital. Sean Cockburn and Karen Jewers have just had their offer
accepted on a Pounds 48,000 three-bedroom semi in Darlington.
'I think Pounds 30,000 (the current ceiling) is unfair. You can buy a house
for that but it's not a very good house,' he says.
Others had specific concerns related to the industry they represented.
Dennis Marks, 45, is the new general director of the English National Opera.
He complains: 'The voice of the arts community isn't being heard in
Whitehall.'
Among his wishes are that the Treasury earmarks lottery proceeds for capital
projects. And he cherishes a 'pipe-dream' that it zero-rates for VAT the
performing arts, which are subject to the tax in full.
Martin Jay, managing director of Vosper Thornycroft, the shipbuilder, speaks
for the hard-pressed defence industry. He understands the pressures of the
public-spending round and the need for cuts, but hopes to hear the
chancellor announce the go-ahead for the tender for a new batch of Royal
Navy minehunters.
In general he believes that the market-testing initiative, if properly
pursued, could deliver 'much better value in certain defence areas - support
activities for the RN, training, and running ranges - than it does out of
leaving it to the grey-suited civil servants'.
Martin Laing is chairman of John Laing, the construction group. His main
worry is that public-sector spending cuts will hit capital projects hard.
'I realise there are difficulties in these straitened times but we have to
keep capital projects going to create jobs.'
All the business people interviewed wanted 'encouragement' for capital
investment. Geoff Cross, 47, is chief executive of Aerospace Systems &amp;
Technologies in Consett, County Durham, and lives in a modern four-bedroomed
house on an estate in Hexham, Northumberland. He sees no virtue in
kick-starts but seeks a return to long-term economic management.
'You can't run the economy on politics - we have to get away from short-term
expediency. We now have more people unemployed than involved in
manufacturing in the UK. That's disgusting. We have a diminishing tax
revenue-raising base to operate from.'
Kenneth Clarke will have a difficult task pleasing many of these voters. He
is already becoming known as a political chancellor. These interviews
suggest he would do well to take note that the British still seem to deem
certain areas - such as tax relief on mortgages, and zero-rating of VAT on
children's clothes and books - as sacrosanct.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Reduction in interest rates demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 70 of a panel of 100 top businessmen, industrialists, politicians
and other opinion formers want reductions in interest rates, with
three-quarters seeking a cut of 1 percentage point or more, John Willman
writes. Interest rates fell 0.5 percentage point last week.
The opinion formers, polled regularly by Opinion Leader Research, are
overwhelmingly against Budget increases in income tax or value added tax.
They are also opposed to extensions in the scope of VAT, but there is
support for reducing or abolishing mortgage interest tax relief.
There is comfort for the chancellor in the panel's growing optimism in the
economic situation. Sixty nine expect the economy to improve in the next 12
months. A year ago just 48 of the panel were optimistic. And 73 believe that
the economy has improved in the past 12 months, compared with one a year
ago. A quarter believe that the government's policies are the right ones for
the economy. But two-thirds believe that there has been no 'economic
miracle' in recent years, and that the British economy is no stronger than
it used to be.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Redwood hits back on valleys renewal drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, has strongly defended the government
initiative to regenerate the south Wales valleys after last week's official
report which cast doubt on the success of its efforts to create jobs.
He said: 'I think that without the initiative the valleys would have been
much worse off.'
The report published by the Government Statistical Service said
manufacturing jobs created had been more than offset by job losses, and that
more factories had closed than had opened.
The initiative was launched in 1988 by Lord Walker, then Welsh secretary,
and who now chairs the regeneration agency English Partnerships. Public
funding totalling Pounds 773m has been spent on the Welsh initiative, and a
second five-year programme was launched this year.
Mr Redwood said the figures concealed the impact of the recession. He said:
'In the recession the valleys performed relatively very well. Had we been in
boom conditions, I think we would have seen very strong positive advances in
the valleys.'
The valleys programme has been criticised as a marketing exercise
encompassing projects such as land reclamation and house renovation which
might have taken place anyway and with little additional funding. But Mr
Redwood described marketing as vital.
'It was very important to try to lift the image of the valleys, both within
the valleys themselves to encourage more self-help and to the outside world
to persuade new investors that this was a beautiful part of Wales with a
future, and not just a scarred piece of Wales with a past that had gone
wrong,' he said.
Mr Redwood emphasised the need for private-sector investment but said he
supported intervention by the government in such severe circumstances.
He said: 'I think it is quite reasonable for government to spend money to
take action when some or all of the problems have been aided or abetted by
public-sector activity. In the valleys it was the rapid decline of
nationalised industries which had created the unemployment and left enormous
scars on the landscape.
'I was a strong supporter of the valleys initiative at the time (it was
launched), although people will now try to claim that the leopard has
changed his spots.'
Mr Redwood accused Labour of attacking the initiative from contradictory
standpoints. He said: 'They're both arguing that the expenditure of these
large sums of public money hasn't done any good, and they're arguing that we
ought to spend a lot more.' The valleys had done 'extremely well' in terms
of relative government funding.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Telecoms outsourcing 'rejected'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 90 per cent of large companies have rejected the idea of
contracting out telecommunications, says an industry survey published today.
The Telecommunications Managers Association survey casts a shadow over the
strategies of British Telecommunications and Mercury to generate a
multi-billion-pound business from the 'outsourcing' of company
telecommunications requirements. BT in particular is seeking to develop a
market for international outsourcing through the Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds
3.6bn) alliance it forged this summer with MCI, the second-largest US
long-distance carrier.
The survey of 439 large companies reveals that only 6 per cent have decided
to outsource the management of their telecommunications. Fewer than half of
the companies had considered outsourcing. Of those which had considered it,
45 per cent said they had rejected it because telecommunications were
strategic to their business, while 44 per cent could see no cost benefit.
Nearly one in four feared 'entrapment' by the outsourcer.
Mr Graham Marriner, chairman of the association, said: 'Most large companies
still see telecoms as a core activity, and are very reluctant to describe
their requirements in detail to a third party.'
The survey underlines the divide between US and European practice. In the US
the market for telecommunications outsourcing is large and growing. In most
of Europe it remains modest.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Clarke regime gives mandarins more time for
lunch - Peter Marsh explains how the chancellor's relaxed approach has won
him friends at the Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asked about how life has changed since Mr Kenneth Clarke took over as
chancellor, the Treasury mandarin patted his stomach. Even with the strains
of preparing the first Budget covering both tax and spending, top officials
have found more time for lunch.
They have taken their cue from Mr Clarke, who has brought a new air of
self-confidence to a government department heavily criticised for economic
policy mistakes in recent years.
A government official said: 'Clarke has been good for the Treasury. He has a
view about everything and has refused to get bogged down in economic jargon.
Unlike (former chancellor) Norman Lamont, who identified with the Treasury,
Clarke really does not care about the place as an institution. The
relationship is healthier.'
Since replacing Mr Lamont six months ago Mr Clarke has abandoned the
Treasury tradition of barely talking to the outside world in the pre-Budget
period.
One former Treasury official witnessed Mr Clarke earlier this month discuss
at a City lunch the possibility of imposing extra taxes on pension funds in
tomorrow's Budget. He said: 'It took my breath away to see the chancellor
discussing potential victims, rather than hide from sight.'
While morale at the Treasury has been helped by signs of economic recovery
after the traumas of the recession and sterling's devaluation, another
important factor has been Mr Clarke's personality. A government official
said: 'People talk about Clarke as a future prime minister. This is bound to
affect the confidence of the people working for him.'
Another official said: 'He's better at reading his briefs than Mr Lamont and
better organised.' This means fewer set-piece meetings in the chancellor's
office to talk about such issues as monetary policy or European affairs.
While Mr Lamont often called two such meetings a day, each of them involving
up to 10 officials whose workloads were consequently stretched, Mr Clarke
makes do with about two a week.
The generally positive view about the chancellor - a political heavyweight
who came to the Treasury after a succession of cabinet jobs including home
secretary and secretary for health and education - is shared by several
outside the department.
Mr James Bruxner, chairman of the Scotch Whisky Association, which has
regular contacts with the Treasury, said of a recent meeting with Mr Clarke
about the Budget: 'Unlike Mr Lamont, who played his cards very close to his
chest, Mr Clarke came across as eager to have a dialogue.'
Mr Clarke appears to be attracted by the political rather than the technical
aspects of the chancellor's job. One person who talked to him recently about
the Budget said: 'His eyes flashed when I suggested he could pull off a coup
by increasing taxes now, only to bring them down again later in what could
be a vote winner ahead of a 1997 election.'
Some believe Mr Clarke has not done enough to get on top of economic issues.
He has left such details to two of his top civil servants - Sir Terry Burns,
Treasury permanent secretary, and Mr Alan Budd, the department's chief
economic adviser - with whom he has struck a friendly though not
particularly close relationship.
One person close to the Treasury said: 'My fear is that he does not know
enough (about economics) and that at some point this could trip him up.'
On broad political questions the chancellor relies on Mrs Tessa Keswick, his
political adviser at the Treasury, who worked for him at his other cabinet
positions.
Mrs Keswick is a former Conservative councillor in the London borough of
Kensington and Chelsea, and sister-in-law of Sir 'Chips' Keswick, chairman
of Hambros Bank. She is fiercely protective of Mr Clarke and fond of
referring to him as 'my man'. One insider says of Mrs Keswick: 'She's a
sensible middle-aged lady who has a good political feel.'
Not everyone at the Treasury has a wholly positive view of Mr Clarke. Some
officials concerned with public spending and economics are said to have been
put out after being subjected to 'aggressive' questioning from the
chancellor. One person close to him said: 'Clarke can be brusque but he's
hardly ever malicious. He's used to getting into a new department and asking
enough questions until he's on top of his brief.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Curbs set for third radio network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Radio Authority has ordered that the rock or classical music output of
the UK's third independent national radio network should be no more than 10
per cent of total airtime, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The restrictions will be spelt out tomorrow when the authority advertises
the third INR licence.
Under broadcasting legislation at least one of the three new national
services has to be predominantly speech-based. The first two to be launched,
Classic FM and Virgin 1215, are both music services. So the authority is
insisting that 51 per cent of airtime in any three-hour period should be
speech.
Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, said: 'INR3 could be
anything from an all-speech news/talk station or one with a sports emphasis
to a mix of, say, studio conversations, phone-ins and appropriate music.'
Bids have to be submitted by March 15 and the licence will be awarded in
June or July. This means that INR3 could be on air using the old BBC Radio 1
medium wave frequencies by the end of next year.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Apprentice scheme expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An apprenticeship scheme for people aged from 16 to 19 is expected to be
suggested by the chancellor in the Budget tomorrow, Lisa Wood writes.
The scheme would replace Youth Training and would aim to give qualifications
up to the National Vocational Qualification level three, which is a
crafts-level qualification. At present most YT students aim for NVQ level
two.
Funding for the scheme would be related to the acquisition of skills.
Youth Training has had a poor image among participants and employers.
Growing numbers of young people are preferring to remain at school or
college rather than join YT.
The Department of Employment's Pounds 1.8bn training programme is likely to
be cut in the Budget, with schemes catering for unemployed adults believed
to be vulnerable.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Bank issues low-charge credit card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MBNA, the US bank which recently set up its UK headquarters in Chester, has
launched a credit card which undercuts most of its rivals by at least 4
percentage points.
The bank is offering an introductory annualised percentage rate of just 13.9
per cent to those transferring the balance from their existing card to its
UK Scenic series Visa cards. The rate is fixed until July 31 next year.
The interest rate on new purchases is 17.9 APR and the bank guarantees not
to apply the Pounds 10 annual fee to new cardholders in the first two years.
APRs on credit cards from established issuers are significantly higher,
although some issuers are reviewing their rates in the wake of last week's
base rate cut.
Barclaycard, the UK's largest issuer with 8.8m cards, lowered its APR by 1
percentage point last week, down to 21.9, and National Westminster bank, the
second-largest issuer, also cut its rate from 23.9 to 22.4.
The UK credit card market has become increasing competitive. Last month
Vauxhall, the subsidiary of General Motors, became the first UK carmaker to
enter the credit-card market, launching a British version of the GM card
available in the US.
The card, issued in association with HFC bank, offered customers a discount
of up to Pounds 2,500 towards the cost of a new Vauxhall car and carried an
interest rate of 19.9 APR and no annual fee.
Save &amp; Prosper, the financial services group, made an aggressive bid to
double its small credit-card customer base of 100,000 cards by launching a
new Visa card in September carrying an APR of 14.6 per cent.
MBNA, which is based in Newark, Delaware, is the second-largest US lender on
credit cards after Citibank.
Barclaycard said yesterday that MBNA's arrival was another example of
increasing competition in the credit-card market but appeared sceptical that
MBNA would be able or willing to maintain a low interest rate.
It said: 'We have seen many cases where a card is launched with a low
interest rate and no fee to obtain customers but after a while the interest
rate creeps up and an annual fee is introduced.'
Barclaycard intends to maintain its increased share of the market - from 34
per cent of turnover in 1990 to 37 per cent today - which it attributed to
the range of perks and benefits available on a Barclaycard.
MBNA has also issued a gold card with the same 17.9 APR on purchases.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Catering deals elude private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compulsory competitive tendering of catering has failed to have much impact,
with only 6 per cent of contracts put out to tender being awarded to private
contractors.
A report from the Institute of Public Finance shows that local authority
contracts form only 1.4 per cent of the Pounds 2.4bn contract-catering
market.
No great savings have been made for the public, with a 1.5 per cent increase
in expenditure on education and welfare catering since compulsory
competitive tendering was introduced. Some counties have raised school-meal
charges and others are phasing them out.
The catering industry accepts that the Transfer of Undertakings (Public
Employees) regulations (Tupe) apply to council catering contracts. This
means that employees must be offered jobs on their existing terms and
con-ditions, and most con-tractors are tendering on this basis.
But the institute said that opportunities for the private sector would
increase because of the introduction of local management in schools.
It said the high cost of taking over county council school-meals budgets -
the average annual contract is Pounds 1.8m - barred most contract caterers.
Of the 2,500 UK contract-catering companies, 62 per cent have an annual
turnover of less than Pounds 100,000.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Fear of job loss ebbing, says poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears among British workers that they may lose their jobs in the next 12
months fell slightly in November, the latest MORI/IRS survey for the
Financial Times suggests.
Fear of redundancy and unemployment rose sharply in the previous month to 53
per cent of those in full-time or part-time work. This month the figure fell
to 47 per cent.
Anxiety is most prevalent among women, part-timers and the young. People in
the Midlands appear the most vulnerable, with very little improvement in
confidence compared with the north and south.
Mr David Martin, editorial director of Industrial Relations Services (IRS),
said the figures might have been influenced by the fall in the latest set of
official unemployment figures.
But he said: 'It must still be of concern that almost half of those
interviewed fear for their jobs in the next 12 months.'
The surveys, which started in April, also show big monthly fluctuations in
the number of people who believe that the economy will improve.

FT  29 NOV 93 / DTI faces grilling over exports at Scott inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is bracing itself for some
unprecedented public scrutiny of its export control regime when the Scott
arms-for-Iraq inquiry hearings resume today after a two-week adjournment.
Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC plan to
question senior DTI officials about statements they made to Customs and
Excise which led to the prosecution last year of three executives of the
machine tool manufacturer Matrix Churchill for breaching export regulations.
The focus on the DTI is being greeted privately with some relief by the
Foreign Office, which considers itself to have unfairly borne the brunt of
public examination by the inquiry so far. One Foreign Office official said:
'Scott has tried to suggest that we should have acted as the guardian of
Whitehall's virginity, when it was the DTI and the MoD that were
responsible.'
Appearing today will be Mr Eric Beston, the head of the DTI's overseas
branch responsible for export controls and licensing from 1985-1990. He will
be followed over the next two weeks by Mr Michael Petter, former head of the
DTI's Middle East exports branch and at present an assessor for the Queen's
Awards to Industry, and two other senior DTI officials, Mr Anthony Steadman
and Mr Michael Coolican.
The DTI will come under pressure to explain why it gave witness statements
to Customs and Excise claiming that officials had no idea that machine tools
being exported by the UK were used by the Iraqis for munitions manufacture.
Documents which the government tried to withhold from the Matrix Churchill
trial but which have been considered by the Scott inquiry as important
evidence show that officials and ministers were aware the machine tools were
being put to military use. A senior Ministry of Defence official told the
Scott inquiry earlier this month that DTI officials tried to block the
prosecution of the Matrix Churchill businessmen to protect intelligence and
ministers.
According to evidence submitted by the Foreign Office, former trade
ministers were involved in an apparent attempt to persuade the government to
breach its own export rules.
Since then the Scott inquiry has been taking further evidence in a private
hearing from the intelligence services in an attempt to unravel the reasons
why certain defence-related exports were licensed by Whitehall officials
with the apparent blessing of their ministers.
In correspondence with the Confederation of British Industry, trade unions,
and government departments, Lord Justice Scott has made clear that he will
make recommendations for a reform of Britain's export and licensing
procedures when he publishes his report next summer.

He will be followed over the next two weeks by Mr Michael Petter, former
head of the DTI's Middle East exports branch and at present an assessor for
the Queen's Awards to Industry, and two other senior DTI officials, Mr
Anthony Steadman and Mr Michael Coolican.
The DTI will come under pressure to explain why it gave witness statements
to Customs and Excise claiming that officials had no idea that machine tools
being exported by the UK were used by the Iraqis for munitions manufacture.

FT  29 NOV 93 / How news of contacts spread to other parties

<TEXT>
Knowledge of the British government's contacts with Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the IRA, over the past three years appears to have extended to the
Irish government, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic
Unionist Party (DUP), although not all became aware at the same time.
Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein chief of staff, said in a BBC TV
interview yesterday that the first meeting, in September 1990, lasted three
hours with representatives of the Foreign Office, at the request of the
British government. This led subsequently to 'fairly intense contact between
the British government representatives and ourselves and culminated this
year in intensive contacts', he said.
He said that 'face-to-face' dialogue was halted in July this year at the
time of the Maastricht vote, because of an agreement between the government
and the UUP. That contact had since continued 'on a weekly basis and
sometimes on a daily basis'.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the deputy leader of the UUP, said yesterday: 'It is my
understanding that for some time the IRA has been talking about a ceasefire
and has spelt out its price for that.' He said that the UUP knew these
contacts had been taking place since last March, and that through 'ongoing
liaison' with the government 'by June we suspected what was happening'.
It was then that Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, 'made his feelings
known to the prime minister,' he said, and contact with Mr McGuinness was
broken before the Maastricht vote in July.
Mr Maginnis said the UUP's position since then has been to offer a seat at
the negotiating table to Sinn Fein in return for a verifiable cessation of
violence. 'We didn't stick our necks out without knowing what we are dealing
with,' he said.
The Rev William McCrea DUP MP for Mid-Ulster, said yesterday that his party
had had 'documentary evidence' of the British government-IRA contacts for
the past four weeks.
Sinn Fein sources say that it was due to the leaks of these talks by
unionist politicians that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, decided to
make the contacts public two weeks ago, and after Mr Major had said that it
'would turn his stomach' to talk to the IRA.
The Irish government was yesterday playing down its own knowledge of the
contacts. A government spokesman said only: 'It is up to the parties
concerned to comment.'
However, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hinted in the Dail
earlier this month that his government had its own contacts with Sinn Fein.
This was later confirmed by Mr Brian Lenihan, the chairman of the Dial's
foreign affairs committee.
A week ago Mr Lenihan was quoted in a Dublin weekly newspaper as saying that
the Irish government had contacts with Sinn Fein 'through intermediaries'
and that it had been aware for some time of similar contacts by the British
government.
'Contact has been going on for months . . . The contact is not immediate but
the government is aware that contacts are made. Messages are received and
are passed on. If we are to achieve peace, these contacts are necessary,' he
said.
Mr Lenihan, who is a senior figure in the governing Fianna Fail party, said
that 'We must realise the importance of contact between the two governments
on the one hand and paramilitaries on the other. This does not put obstacles
in the way of the constitutional parties. In fact, the two efforts
complement each other . . . History is a record of coming to terms with
terrorists and getting them to embrace the democratic process.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Ulster politics of discontent poisoned further: PM will try
to stem damage by publishing documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing new about contacts between British governments and
representatives of Sinn Fein. Nor is it the first time in 25 years of
carnage that the IRA has made private overtures about peace. But the storm
whipped up by the revelation of extensive contacts between Mr John Major's
administration and Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein was no less
embarrassing for that.
After months of painstaking effort to nurture a climate of reassurance to
allow the resumption of talks on a political settlement in the province, Mr
Major faced a barrage of criticism at the weekend.
Opposition leaders joined hard-line Ulster unionists in accusing Mr Major
and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, of lies at worst and
skilful duplicity at best.
The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party appeared confident that it
now had the ammunition to blow up efforts by London and Dublin to agree a
constitutional framework for Ulster which would marginalise the terrorists.
British ministers acknowledged that the disclosure of the talks - just a
week after the damaging leak in Dublin of the Irish government's draft
proposals for a political settlement - would poison further the atmosphere
of distrust which permeates Northern Ireland politics.
But Downing Street insisted that no direct lies had been told. Mr Major's
constant disavowal of negotiations or talks with Sinn Fein was technically
accurate. Replies through intermediaries were not quite the same thing.
That, in the famous words of a former cabinet secretary, is what is known as
being economical with the truth.
But Mr Major hopes the publication later today of all the documents which
passed between his government and Sinn Fein will begin to repair the damage.
Significantly, the message from Number 10 Downing Street was that he had
fully approved of the contacts and would stand firmly by Sir Patrick. He
would also press ahead with efforts to end the violence and to put in place
a durable political settlement.
Officials said the documents would show that the government had been as
constant in its approach in private as in public. It had offered a place at
the negotiating table to Sinn Fein, but only after a permanent end to
violence.
The officials were unapologetic about the contacts - Mr Major's view was
that the government could not possibly ignore the possibility that the IRA
was serious about an end to violence. That possibility was taken seriously
by British intelligence and by the Irish government and Mr John Hume, the
leader of Ulster's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party.
As one British official said recently, most of the terrorist organisations
which have plagued the west since the 1970s - from the Red Brigades to the
PLO - had given up. Even Libya appeared reluctant now to sponsor terrorists.
So 'we have to allow for the possibility that the IRA has had enough'.
Sir Patrick hopes that the mainstream Ulster Unionists led by Mr James
Molyneaux will accept that the contacts did not amount to anything
approaching a conspiracy to undercut the government's constitutional
guarantee on the future of Ulster.
His fear must be that if Mr Paisley manages to take grassroots Protestant
opinion with him, then Mr Molyneaux also will be dragged towards complete
disavowal of a search for a comprehensive settlement.
There were one or two hopeful signs yesterday. Conservative MPs strongly
committed to the preservation of the union chose not to attack the prime
minister. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said it would have been
wrong not to respond to the IRA. Mr Molyneaux, briefed in advance of the
revelation, appeared ready to reserve judgment.
But trust - or rather the absence of it - has always been the deciding
factor in efforts to restore peace to Northern Ireland. Nobody in London
could argue that the latest revelations would not heighten suspicion and
hostility.
Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, will try to
rebuild confidence at their forthcoming summit, still pencilled in for
Friday of this week. Mr Reynolds does not want the issue to sour the
atmosphere at the meeting.
The two leaders will seek to reassure the unionists with a communique
restating Dublin's willingness to drop its constitutional claim to Northern
Ireland and to accept the Protestant majority's veto over changes in the
status of the province.
Mr Reynolds wants to complement that with a statement designed to reinforce
the pressure on Sinn Fein to come in from the terrorist cold - a 'framework
for peace' which would recognise the aspirations of the nationalist
community while offering guarantees to the unionists.
But Mr Major will find it hard if not impossible now to maintain contact
with Sinn Fein. The need to reassure Mr Molyneaux will make still harder the
compromises essential to any political settlement.
In her recent memoirs Baroness Thatcher warned her successors of the
intractability of Northern Ireland. Distrust mounting to hatred and revenge
was never far beneath the political surface. 'Those who step on it', she
concluded, 'must do so gingerely'. Mr Major no longer needs telling.

FT  29 NOV 93 / More than a conduit, insists Adams: Adams calls Mayhew a
liar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein yesterday rejected the British government's contention that secret
contacts with Sinn Fein had been made through intermediaries in response to
an IRA wish to end the conflict.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said at a news conference in West
Belfast yesterday that the contact amounted to 'more than a mere conduit'.
He said that meetings had been approved by Mr Major, were known about at
cabinet level, and involved several senior civil servants.
Mr Adams disputed Sir Patrick Mayhew's explanation that the IRA had
considered the conflict over. He said: 'At no point was there any
communication from the IRA that the conflict was over.'
Mr Adams accused Sir Patrick of lying about the contacts between the
government and Sinn Fein. He said outlines of policy had been exchanged and
discussed. He indicated that he was preparing to publish material exchanged
between the two sides, saying that it was of the utmost importance to point
out that the issue of talking to Sinn Fein was a distraction. Talks at this
time were not necessary to move towards a lasting peace.
'This required the British government to fulfil its responsibilities. John
Major knows what he needs to do. He knows that the Irish peace initiative
deals with the substantive issues and includes the principles, the dynamic
and the process required to bring peace to Ireland. To use the words of John
Hume, 'Mr Major holds the key'.'
Mr Adams said the government was only interested in protecting its own
position and that Mr Major had no serious interest in conceding to the Irish
people their right to a peaceful future.
He insisted the contact was between Sinn Fein and the government and not the
IRA and the government.
He confirmed it pre-dated February but said, contrary to what Sir Patrick
Mayhew said: 'This particular phase of the contact was initiated by the
British government. Mayhew is telling lies from beginning to end.'
He said Sir Patrick and Mr Major had denied knowing anything that was in the
Hume-Adams initiative, denied on numerous occasions that there were any
contacts at all between the government and Sinn Fein and insisted there
could be no contact without pre-conditions while they were at the same time
actively engaged in contacts.
'The record shows quite clearly all of these things are lies and are proved
to be lies.'
Mr Adams added: 'They have lied to their own parliament, to James Molyneaux
(Ulster Unionist party leader), and to the Irish and British people about
the existence and nature of their contact with Sinn Fein.'
He said the government had for some time set its face against a real peace
process. It had refused to make the change of policy required to 'move all
of us forward into a negotiated settlement. In the course of our contact
with their representatives they rejected and walked away from a peace
process'.
A Sinn Fein spokeswoman said yesterday, however: 'The main point is not
about who said what and when. This is a distraction from the main goal of
laying a basis for getting this war over and done with.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Abortive initiatives go back more than 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The history of the IRA's campaign against the British government is littered
with abandoned initiatives and meetings between serving politicians and
republican leaders.
Discussions since the early 1970s have been veiled in secrecy because of the
sensitivity of both the unionists and successive Irish governments.
Lord Wilson, when leader of the Labour opposition, met IRA leaders in Dublin
in 1971 and again the next year in England. The first meeting was described
as an 'act of treachery' by Dr Garret FitzGerald, the then Irish president,
and a 'waffling session' by Mr Joe Cahill, one of the IRA leaders present.
The most direct formal talks between a government and republicans came in
June 1972 when Lord Whitelaw, as secretary of state for Northern Ireland,
held secret and abortive talks to try to arrange a ceasefire with a group of
six republican leaders in London.
The republicans, including Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president who had
been interned in Long Kesh, and Mr Martin McGuinness, his deputy, were flown
out of Belfast by the RAF and escorted in great secrecy to the Chelsea house
of Mr Paul Channon, Whitelaw's junior minister.
The IRA team, led by Mr Sean MacStiofain, the then Provisionals'
chief-of-staff, demanded the right to national self-determination for the
Irish people as a whole, a declaration by the government to withdraw troops
within 2 1/2 years and an amnesty for political prisoners.
Lord Whitelaw declared afterwards in his memoirs that the meeting was a
'non-event'. He wrote: 'The IRA leaders simply made impossible demands which
I told them the British government would never concede. They were in fact
still in a mood of defiance and determination to carry on until their absurd
ultimatums were met.'
Mr McGuinness admitted that his team had concluded they had not reached a
position at that time where they could do 'serious business' with the
British government.
During 1974 and 1975, under the then Labour government, senior officials
regularly met Sinn Fein leaders at Laneside, a large government-owned house
to the east of Belfast. These meetings, authorised by Mr Merlyn Rees, then
Northern Ireland secretary, helped establish local channels of communication
with the IRA in Belfast, used to discuss arrangements for the ceasefire of
1975.
Other, less formal contacts, have been established from time to time. Mr
Douglas Hurd, now foreign secretary, was a frontbench spokesman on European
affairs when he met Mr Adams and Mr Danny Morrison of Sinn Fein in Belfast
in 1978. Mr Hurd stressed that he was acting as an individual.
Informal and formal meetings alike have generally caused unease in the Irish
republic. Dr Garret FitzGerald, the former Irish prime minister, said in his
memoirs: 'The contacts that had taken place had had the effect merely of
prolonging violence by deluding the IRA into believing that a British
government would eventually negotiate a settlement with them.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Mayhew declines to elaborate on 'chain of communication':
Unionists demand resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After months of denials, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary,
admitted yesterday that the British government had been in contact with the
IRA leadership through a 'chain of communication'.
As unionist MPs demanded his resignation, Sir Patrick hastily convened a
press conference at Stormont Castle in Belfast for what most political
observers saw as a damage-limitation exercise. Yes, a message had been sent
to the IRA but no, there had not been talks or negotiations with terrorist
leaders and no one from the British government or civil service was
authorised to conduct such talks.
Sir Patrick said a message was received from the IRA at the end of February
to the effect that 'the conflict was over' and asked for advice on how to
bring it to a close.
The government responded by demanding a 'genuine ending of violence' before
there was any question of talks.
Sir Patrick said: 'Nobody has been authorised to enter into discussions with
the IRA. The people of Northern Ireland do not want peace at any price and
in my judgment the IRA should not be offered a price.'
He firmly rejected questions about the nature of the 'communication channel'
as it could 'endanger lives'.
'There is a chain of communication. I am not prepared to enter into
discussion or description of that chain. To do that could endanger lives,'
Sir Patrick said.
He disclosed that the chain had been in place for a number of years and
remained confidential.
But it was on the question of the government's reluctance to acknowledge the
existence of the contact with the IRA that Sir Patrick found himself under
most pressure.
At one point he was asked: 'Do you accept that you deceived people in
Northern Ireland?' He rejected the suggestion.
Another questioner asked him to elaborate on the difference between talking
to and writing to the IRA. He replied: 'Well, you use your mouth when
talking.'
The Northern Ireland secretary revealed that contacts had taken place
recently.
He disclosed that another message from the IRA was received on November 2,
two days after the Greysteel massacre and after one of the worst months of
violence in the Northern Ireland troubles. Another reply was sent on
November 5.
The Democratic Unionist deputy leader, Mr Peter Robinson, reacted angrily to
the disclosures and said unionists no longer trusted the government. Mr
Robinson claimed it was inconceivable that one of the most sophisticated
terrorist organisations in the world would ask the government for advice on
ending violence.
In an effort to reassure MPs, Sir Patrick said the correspondence to date
would be placed in the Commons library as soon as possible.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the contacts had been
authorised by the prime minister as well as Sir Patrick. But Mr Adams
disputed the government's version of events and said that at no point was
there any communication from the IRA stating that the conflict was over.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, warned the prime minister
that his credibility was 'now on the line'. He said: 'The prospects for
peace and a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland today trembles
in the balance as a result of what is now revealed as at best stupidity and
at worst duplicity by the prime minister and the government.'
The Rev Ian Paisley (above), Democratic Unionist party leader (below), said
he was devastated the government had been talking to the IRA while publicly
denying it.
He said there had been 'deliberate bare-faced lying from Downing Street'.
'Both the prime minister and the secretary of state are involved.'
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said there had been contact
for years, not just months - but no talks. There was a 'chain of
communication', but he insisted there had been no negotiation and no talks.
Mr John Hume (above), leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party
(below), told BBC Radio 4: 'I am trying to face up to the real problem in
Northern Ireland, and that problem is of a divided people. It cannot be
solved by a victory of one side over the other.'
Mr Peter Robinson (above), deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party
(below) commented: 'Can you imagine how the people of Northern Ireland feel
this morning when they see that they are being used as pawns while
politicians do dirty deals behind their backs, and they are to know nothing
about
it until it is too
late, and they are handed over to their traditional enemies?'
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, said the British government had
'lied to their own parliament, to James Molyneaux and to the Irish and
British people'. 'The process of dialogue and contact between the British
government and Sinn Fein was more than a mere conduit.'
Mr Kevin McNamara (below), shadow Northern Ireland Secretary (below), said:
'What is at stake is the question of the integrity and honour of the British
government.'

Hugh Gaitskell, Labour leader who died in 1963, was quoted in a letter to
the Guardian by Dora Gaitskell in August 1977: 'All terrorists, at the
invitation of the government, end up with drinks at the Dorchester.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, then Northern Ireland secretary, said in August 1985:
'Giving space to terrorists has a very powerful effect and it is up to the
broadcasting authorities to understand this.' on BBC interview with Martin
McGuinness, August 1985.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said in a statement to Mr Dennis Skinner
in the Commons on November 1 1993: 'If the implication of his (Gerry Adams')
remarks is that we should sit down and talk with Mr Adams and the
Provisional IRA, I can only say that that would turn my stomach .. we will
not do it.'
On November 15 Mr Major said: 'There can be no secret deals, no rewards for
terrorism, no abandonment of the vital principal of majority consent.'

FT  29 NOV 93 / Mexico's would-be president named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MERIDA, YUCATAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party has chosen Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio, the country's social development minister and an economic reformer,
as its candidate for next year's presidential election.
The PRI, which announced its decision yesterday, has been in power for 64
years, and Mr Colosio is the strong favourite to win next August's election,
taking over from President Carlos Salinas.
Under Mexico's constitution, the winner will govern the country from
December 1 next year until the end of 2000.
Mr Colosio, 43, was front-runner for the succession, partly because of his
loyalty to President Salinas and partly because of his economic and
political goals. He is expected to push ahead with the pro-market economic
reforms and cautious political changes which marked the Salinas presidency.
Mr Colosio said before he was nominated that he would give more power to the
states, traditionally dominated by Mexico City. He said deregulation and
economic reform had to be extended if Mexico was to become more competitive
and the political system more democratic.
As social development minister, Mr Colosio has been responsible for the
government's anti-poverty programme and environmental policy. He has
travelled the country inaugurating public works projects, and built up an
array of local contacts.
Critics say he has no clear philosophy of government and may not be able to
respond adequately to short-term problems. A minister who has sat with him
in cabinet says he made few significant contributions, and few knew what he
believed in.
Mr Colosio was the only one of the candidates to have held elected office.
Supporters say he will provide continuity with President Salinas.
Mr Colosio was born in the northern town of Magdelena, Sonora. He went to
university in the industrial city of Monterrey, and has a graduate degree in
urban development from the University of Pennsylvania. He has become one of
the president's most loyal aides, and helped to mastermind the PRI's victory
in the 1991 legislative elections.
The Mexican state of Yucatan voted for a new governor yesterday in a closely
fought election where the centre-right opposition has a chance of snatching
victory from the governing party, adds Damian Fraser.

<TEXT>
Israeli helicopter gunships attacked two Palestinian bases in Lebanon
yesterday, while further shooting erupted in the occupied Gaza strip, writes
Our Foreign Staff.
Two helicopters fired missiles at bases of two radical Damascus-based
Palestinian groups at a refugee camp near Sidon, wounding three people. It
was the fifth Israeli air raid over south Lebanon since the
Israeli-Palestinian accord was signed in September.
Palestinians in Gaza said Israeli troops shot dead an activist from the
PLO's Fatah faction in a gunfight. In a separate incident the Israeli army
said one of its soldiers was wounded when shots were fired at an army post
in Gaza City.
The violence came as Israeli ministers played down talk of a crisis in talks
with the PLO on the planned self-rule for Gaza and the Jericho area of the
West Bank.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Medellin drug chief may surrender to authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The flight of Pablo Escobar's family from Colombia has fuelled speculation
that the Medelln drug chief is about to surrender again to the authorities.
Escobar has been on the run since he escaped from jail 16 months ago. He has
told reporters he wants to surrender but insists his family's safety must be
guaranteed first.
Last week the prosecutor general said official protection for Escobar's wife
and children would be withdrawn. Recently an anti-tank rocket was fired at
the family flat and there have been numerous attacks on Escobar's property
and associates.
Four family members - his wife and two children and a woman believed to be
engaged to his son - flew to Germany yesterday, but were refused permission
to stay. They were being held at Frankfurt airport until a flight was
available.
German police said they could go to any country which would take them. Some
of them had valid visas to other countries, but it appeared they would be
sent back to Colombia if none offered asylum.
A recent attempt by other relations to find asylum in Chile also failed.
Local television and radio in Bogota had said the family's departure to a
refuge abroad was part of an arrangement with the government that included
Escobar's surrender.
With the discovery of dozens of his hideouts and the loss of so many of his
henchmen following an extensive police hunt, it has become increasingly
difficult for Escobar to stay ahead of the authorities.
Although the Medelln cartel no longer has the structure to deal and
transport huge volumes of cocaine, Pablo Escobar is still a powerful figure
whose recapture, surrender or death would haved enormous symbolic importance
for the government.

FT  29 NOV 93 / International press review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan
Capital punishment made a rare appearance in the Japanese press highlighting
the new fashion for public debate of sensitive matters symbolised by the
open style of the Hosokawa government.
Reports by Amnesty International and other human rights groups in the Daily
Yomiuri and Japan Times say that up to four convicted murderers were hanged
on Friday, the first executions under the new government. The most recent
executions were in March, when three were hanged.
Curiously, as the Japan Times points out, Japanese law only allows the death
penalty if it is not 'cruel', an ambiguity which gives human rights groups a
field day. Just as oddly, the Justice Ministry never announces executions,
beyond telephoning families a day later, in an attempt to keep hangings out
of the press. Neither do the authorities inform those on death row, so they
live every day thinking the end is imminent.
On this, the government is a secretive as ever, despite the Hosokawa effect.
The information only comes out thanks to Amnesty's diligence in keeping in
touch with families of those under penalty of death, of which 55 remain.
Amnesty admits in the Yomiuri that it still had difficulty over the weekend
in persuading people to sign petitions against capital punishment. Still,
the coverage accorded to the executions by the normally compliant Japanese
press, could indicate emergence of public opinion on the subject.
Serbia
If Vecernje Novosti, the Belgrade daily in the grip of Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic, is to be believed, UN sanctions on Serb-led Yugoslavia
will be lifted any day now.
Headlines promise Serbs a swift improvement of the grim economic situation,
heralding a 'winter without sanctions'. The United Nations 18 months ago
slapped sanctions, including an oil embargo, on Belgrade for supporting the
violent partition of Bosnia.
But Novosti, the biggest circulation newspaper, boasts how Serbia has been
vindicated, with the west finally coming round to the Serbian side. There is
no mention that sanctions will be lifted only if Bosnian Serbs hand over
land to their Moslem foes.
The alleged promise to allow the delivery of heating oil and petrol to
Serbia coincides with parliamentary elections due to be held on December 19.
While the independent newspaper Borba or weekly Vreme more realistically
inform Serbian readers on the current chances for a peace settlement and
lifting of sanctions, few people can afford to buy them. Recent surveys
indicated only 5 per cent of the population buy newspapers; most people rely
on the seemingly omnipotent Television Serbia for information. Pro-Milosevic
papers are heavily subsidised by the cash-strapped government.
Loath to miss an opportunity to demonise their independent competition,
Belgrade press under Mr Milosevic dismissed their rivals as 'traitors to
Serbia' when Borba and Vreme recently received a badly-needed delivery of
newsprint and other supplies from the European Community Humanitarian
Organisation (Echo).
Germany
Mr Steffen Heitmann, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chosen candidate for the
presidency, might finally believe the gods are on his side. He and his aides
were dreading the days after his decision to pull out of the race for the
country's highest office. But the media has been distracted by scandal in
the state government of Saxony-Anhalt in eastern Germany.
Finding a consensus candidate for the presidency after the resignation of Mr
Heitmann, an east German, ran a close second in yesterday's papers - from
Welt am Sontag to Berlin's Tagesspiegel - to the story about the resignation
of the Saxony-Anhalt cabinet.
But the press has made clear it is not getting at the east Germans: in fact,
it is the Wessis, the west Germans, who come in for stick, since the key
positions in Saxony-Anhalt's government are held by west Germans. This seems
to rule out the conspiracy theory, held by many in the east German press,
that all Ossis are seen by their western counterparts as incompetent and
inarticulate.
The fact that any notion of a media conspiracy against Ossis might be
misplaced can be of little comfort to Mr Heitmann. It has been clear in the
press in the past three weeks that the governing Christian Democratic Union,
which endorsed him as its presidential candidate, was getting cold feet. The
conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has been cheering for Mr Roman
Herzog, president of the constitutional court. Not just because he is more
careful and articulate than Mr Heitmann; but because the CDU's rank and file
were fed up with the way Mr Kohl and Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of
the CDU, had foisted the Saxon upon the party without any discussion. By
early last week, publications ranging from the weekly Stern magazine and the
liberal daily Suddeutsche Zeitung to the left-wing Frankfurter Rundschau
were all in agreement that it was time for Mr Heitmann to go.
The east German press has expressed anger about the way Mr Heitmann was
foisted upon them too, and the way the campaign discredited the presidency.
In a sober leader, the Dresden-based Sachsische Zeitung said it was time to
repair the damage. This would probably mean Mr Kohl forgoing his chance to
have an Ossi - and a subservient one at that. It wrote: 'Ostkandidate Ade' -
easterner candidate, Adieu]
United States
The ground of American culture shifted last week as America's most powerful
theatre critic wrote his last review. Mr Frank Rich, who for 13 years has
been the New York Times' chief theatre critic, will leave that position on
Wednesday to become columnist for the Times, an appointment which is among
the highest honours for a Times staffer. Mr Rich, who is 44, will write a
twice-weekly column on American society and culture.
Mr Rich has been replaced as chief theatre critic by Mr David Richards, 53,
who has served as the Times' Sunday theatre critic since 1990, after nine
years as theatre critic of the Washington Post.
The position of Times chief theatre critic is traditionally a powerful one
which, under Mr Rich's tenure, has taken on new heights of influence. Though
his name has been largely reviled among theatre folk, he earned the respect
of his colleagues in the press; local and national coverage of his move has
been surprisingly decorous.
Press and theatre community alike are adopting a wait-and-see attitude
towards Mr Richards, whose graceful writing is widely admired.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Sharp rebuff for BJP in Indian polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hindu militants, who last year unleashed civil unrest and political turmoil
in India after storming the Ayodhya mosque, have suffered a serious setback
in the most important polls held since the 1991 general election.
The Bharatiya Janata Party, the radical Hindu opposition party whose
supporters destroyed the mosque, saw a marked decline in its popularity in
state elections.
However, the ruling Congress (I) party failed to capitalise on the fading of
the BJP's fortunes. Large numbers of voters in Uttar Pradesh, the heartland
of north Indian politics and the most important state to go to the polls,
deserted both major parties.
Mr P Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, had pledged to put economic reform
back at the top of the agenda following the polls. But the mixed results
seem unlikely to inspire the government to tackle controversial problems -
such as over-manning in the bureaucracy and in state-owned industries.
Moreover, the prime minister could come under attack in his own party for
its electoral performance.
Nearly one third of Indian voters were given the opportunity to vote in six
state elections in northern India. By last night, vote-counting was
virtually complete in four states - Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar
Pradesh and the city of Delhi. Counting is due to start tomorrow in Madhya
Pradesh and in the small north-eastern state of Mizoram.
Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were ruled by
the BJP until their assemblies were suspended last year for allegedly
encouraging the Ayodhya mosque's destruction. Congress has won Himachal
Pradesh, a former stronghold, but the BJP seems likely to retain control of
Rajasthan, though without an overall majority. In Uttar Pradesh, north
India's political heartland, voters turned their backs in large numbers on
both main parties and voted for the populist Samajawadi Janata Party and its
allies, a grouping dominated by lower castes.
Last night projections showed the BJP looked likely to win about 170 of the
425 Uttar Pradesh assembly seats, down from 221; the Samajawadi grouping was
likely to secure about 180 and head an anti-BJP coalition government in the
state. Congress, which once dominated Uttar Pradesh, was predicted to take
less than 30 seats.
In Delhi, where state elections were being held for the first time after 40
years of central government rule, the BJP won a clear majority. BJP
officials claimed winning Delhi far outweighed losing Himachal Pradesh
because of the capital's political importance. Congress officials said
anti-BJP forces had gained ground in all the states which had previously
experienced BJP government. Mr R L Bhatia, the deputy foreign minister,
said: 'We have turned the tide against the BJP.'
However, some Congress figures are unhappy with the party's electoral
showing. In a letter to Mr Rao, Mr P R Kumaramangalam, a junior minister,
urged the resignation of party officials responsible for the elections. 'The
present collective leadership that manages the affairs of the party have
failed the party and the people miserably,' wrote Mr Kumaramangalam.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Pakistan refuses to stop nuclear programme
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan said yesterday it would never give up its controversial nuclear
programme until there was an agreement to make the entire region a nuclear
weapons-free zone.
Mr Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali, the country's foreign minister, made the
statement during an abortive debate in parliament which ended in disarray
when opposition MPs led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, stormed out
of parliament in protest at a government attempt to obstruct open discussion
on the nuclear issue. The government cited security reasons.
Pakistan has admitted its ability to build a bomb, but claims its programme
is strictly peaceful.
'The present peaceful programme will continue,' the foreign minister said to
an almost empty house after the opposition had left.
The government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has come under fierce attack
from opposition critics in the PML (Pakistan Muslim League) who are
demanding a full explanation of the country's nuclear policy.
Their demands have gathered pace since last week's reports that the Clinton
administration wants to introduce new legislation which would end the
military and economic aid cut-off against Pakistan.
That cut-off was introduced three years ago following allegations that
Islamabad had acquired the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Pakistan
denies the charge. But last week's reports from Washington have raised fresh
concerns among Pakistani nationalists, who fear that the nuclear programme
which has already been 'capped' or put at a standstill may be 'rolled back'
or cut down in size, as part of a deal.
Last week's move in Washington is the most significant step to resolve the
dispute since the aid cut-off. However, it is not clear if a bill to lift
the embargo against Pakistan would be passed in the US congress.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Army purge strengthens Nigeria's military ruler
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
General Sani Abacha strengthened his position as Nigeria's new head of state
at the weekend by purging army officers loyal to the former military ruler,
Gen Ibrahim Babangida. He also formed a civilian cabinet which balances
tribal loyalties and includes some respected ministers.
The moves show Nigeria's military ruler, who seized power on November 17,
combines ruthlessness and persuasion in dealing with opponents.
Following last week's forced retirement of Lt Gen Aliyu Mohammed as head of
the army, the removal of 17 officers including nine brigadiers is seen as a
decisive blow to Gen Babangida's remaining support in the armed forces. A
reshuffle in September under the interim government had failed to curb
pro-Babangida factions at the senior level or to quell unrest in lower
ranks.
The 33-member cabinet, known as the executive council, includes several
supporters of Mr Moshood Abiola, who emerged the unofficial winner of the
annulled presidential election in June. The cabinet is headed by Gen Abacha
and the chief of general staff, Lt Gen Oladipo Diya, who comes from the
pro-Abiola south-west, and includes as foreign minister Mr Babagana Kingibe,
interior minister Mr Akex Ibru and education minister Dr Iyorchia Ayu.
The finance minister, Mr K I Kalu, served in the same post in the mid-1980s,
earning respect as an advocate of market reforms. Together with Mr Paul
Ogwuma, a recent appointment as central bank governor, Mr Don Etiebet, who
is retained from the interim government as oil minister, and Mr Adamu
Ciroma, another former finance minister, Gen Abacha has an economic team
which, if allowed free rein, could achieve reforms that western creditors
are seeking.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Geneva talks on Bosnia

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a last-ditch attempt to revive talks on Bosnia's partition, leaders of
the republic's warring parties today meet European Union foreign ministers
in Geneva.
The meeting aims to establish a platform for fresh talks, centring on a
phase-out of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro in exchange for territorial
concessions by Bosnian Serbs to the Moslems.
Five people were killed and five wounded in Sarajevo yesterday when a shell
exploded in a city street, showing there was no sign that the violence might
end or that Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders would succeed in reaching a
political settlement for the republic's division into three ethnic states.
Before leaving for Geneva, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia,
urged tighter United Nations sanctions on Serbia if the Bosnian Serbs refuse
to hand over land.
'If the Serb side does not return territories, sanctions should be tightened
and not lifted,' he told a news conference in Sarajevo, which is besieged by
Serb forces.
The EU initiative is a revitalised version of a deal, mediated by envoys
Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, which collapsed in September when
Bosnian Serbs refused to meet Moslem demands for 3-4 per cent more territory
in order to create a viable state.
In an ominous signal for the Geneva talks, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb
leader, said at the weekend his forces, which control 70 per cent of Bosnia,
would insist on the lifting of sanctions on Belgrade before conceding any
land.
Serb leaders who previously endorsed the Geneva plan to hand over 20 per
cent of their land show no trace of intending to fulfil their pledge. In
fact, their troops are seizing more Moslem-held land in northeast Bosnia.
They are apparently confident sanctions will be lifted anyway. However,
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is likely to press his Bosnian proxy,
Mr Karadzic, to hand over land in an attempt to get the sanctions eased
before elections on December 19.

FT  29 NOV 93 / E German state government quits: Saxony-Anhalt ministers
resign after disclosure that they overpaid themselves

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Werner Munch, the prime minister of the eastern German state of
Saxony-Anhalt, yesterday offered the resignation of his entire government
following official disclosures that west German members of his cabinet had
paid themselves too much.
He said that ministers would remain in office as a caretaker administration
until new elections can be held.
The resignation of the conservative-led Christian Democratic Union
government, which is in coalition with the liberal Free Democrats,
represents another blow to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose own federal
government in Bonn comprises a similar coalition. Last week he was forced to
accept the withdrawal of Mr Steffen Heitmann, the justice minister of
Saxony, as candidate for the presidency. He had been Mr Kohl's chosen
candidate for the post.
It is also a setback for the other established political parties. All of
their ratings among east Germans have plummeted following a series of
corruption scandals in western Germany, as well as disenchantment with the
status quo because of high unemployment in the five eastern states.
Mr Munch, a former member of the European Parliament and university
lecturer, told a news conference in Magdeburg, the state's capital, that
neither he nor other ministers had received 'at any time illegal payments. .
. This resignation can only be explained as a step to prevent further damage
to our families, our state and our governing bodies.'
The state audit office in Saxony-Anhalt reported at the weekend that the
west German politicians who had moved to the state as ministers after
unification had together overpaid themselves by as much as DM900,000 (Pounds
357,000) since they took up their posts in mid-1991.
It added that the ministers, including Mr Munch, had inflated their salaries
with excessive entertainment allowances, which had swelled their income by
DM200,000 in the past two years.
Officials in Saxony-Anhalt said last night that, by offering the
resignations now, the CDU and the FDP might be trying to limit the damage in
time for federal and state elections which will be held next year. Next
Sunday's local government elections in the eastern state of Brandenburg,
headed by the Social Democrats, are likely to provide reliable indications
about the mood among east Germans.
The west German cabinet ministers named for excessive payments also include
Mr Horst Rehburger, the Free Democrat economics minister, regarded as
responsible for attracting private investment into the region; Mr Hartmut
Perschau, interior minister; and Mr Werner Schreiber, social affairs
minister.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Occhetto tries to break free from communist past: The leader
of Italy's PDS must convince the world his party could form a credible
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Achille Occhetto, the 57-year-old leader of Italy's Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS), has launched a charm offensive.
Fresh from his party's success in the first round of local elections last
Sunday, he is now trying to convince Italians, and the international
community at large, that the PDS is no longer a prisoner of its communist
past and that it could form the credible core of a future government.
The lira lost ground early last week because speculators reacted with alarm
to the prospect that former communists might dominate Italy's next
government. Thus, the first stage of Mr Occhetto's offensive was his call
early in the week to the financial markets for calm.
This he followed by indicating his willingness to help the government of
Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to ensure the passage of the 1994 budget
legislation - vital for Italy's international credibility. He also submitted
himself to a critical grilling from European Union ambassadors on his
party's economic policy.
As he talks about PDS strategy, in the same imposing offices that once
housed the defunct Italian Communist party (PCI), Mr Occhetto seems to have
dropped his often criticised ambiguity. He has sensed the whiff of power,
and he is obliged to define what the PDS stands for.
The budget will be a key test: the Ciampi government will resign if the
legislation fails to pass. Mr Occhetto wants to avoid this at all costs. He
would prefer the PDS to abstain and avoid associating with a discredited
Christian Democrat-led majority. 'But', he says, 'if the old centrist
majority disappears in parliament, we are prepared to assume our
responsibility (and vote) to approve the budget on condition that parliament
is dissolved immediately thereafter.'
Although 2,500 amendments have been tabled in parliament, he believes the
budget will pass in time, before the end of December. He argues for early
dissolution, saying, 'This parliament has reached the limits of its
credibility. There are too many people there who no longer represent the
electorate to whom they are responsible.'
However, Mr Occhetto has been closer to the Ciampi government than is often
recognised. Three PDS ministers were chosen by the prime minister, but
withdrawn by Mr Occhetto because the four-party coalition backing the
government voted to retain parliamentary immunity privileges to avoid
corruption enquiries.
Mr Occhetto describes this vote as 'morally unacceptable'. However, the
withdrawal of the ministers, only 10 hours after being sworn in, enabled him
to head off a potential storm.
He clearly feels better equipped to oppose internal criticism and is open in
the way he 'appreciates' the present government's efforts to reduce Italy's
huge public sector deficit.
A PDS-based government, he says, would 'continue the restructuring of public
finances and the reorganisation of the civil service'. The idea of a
'spendthrift' left, feeding a large public sector, was over. Funds needed to
relaunch the economy would have to be found without increasing debt levels.
He says much can be done by selling off the state's huge stock of property,
worth L30,000bn (Pounds 12bn).
A late convert to privatisation, Mr Occhetto says he will not oppose the
plans already under way. However, the PDS would seek to give more direction
to industrial policy and encourage more research. His main concern is job
creation, and this is where a progressive government would place more
emphasis. He endorses the idea of 'solidarity contracts' - in the form of
job-sharing or a reduced working week - to get round the recession.
This is a long way from the prevailing party ideology in 1988, when he was
first elected head of the Communist party. It is also a remarkable evolution
from the founding days of the PDS in February 1991. But he is not surprised:
'There had long been a social democrat strain in the PCI. . . that had
similarities with Germany's SPD.'
The party proudly wears its label of the Left and has been admitted to the
Socialist International. Yet, when pressed to define the nature of the
modern Italian left, Mr Occhetto is without a quick slogan; nor does he
refer to the welfare state. Endorsement of the proposed 1994 budget would
mean rolling back welfare benefits and pension privileges. A sore point,
too, is the unresolved rivalry with former fellow members of the Communist
party who split to form the hardline Reconstructed Communism with nearly 10
per cent of the old membership.
He is selling himself as the leader of the first party to break with the
past. He insists that the party has not been involved in systematic
corruption and blames the Christian Democrats and Socialists as the worst
offenders. But he is cynical about the real culprits being punished. 'In
this country you catch the robbers, not the assassins,' he observes with wry
humour.
Although some 112 PDS affiliates have fallen foul of corruption
investigations, this has yet to affect voter support. The PDS is attracting
some 16 per cent of the vote nationwide.
To obtain power, Mr Occhetto was astute enough to realise early the need for
alliances: 'It has required great patience to get this idea across. We are a
moderate force, the only one capable of drawing the disparate forces on the
left together.'
The PDS is the sole party with a national organisation, inherited from the
Communist party. Through this, the PDS has established a series of local
alliances with the Greens, Radicals, left-wing Catholics, former Socialists,
even some Communists, and some dissident Christian Democrats.
'The country is not yet ready for an Anglo-Saxon division into two parties,'
he says. 'The next elections will be fought between two big coalitions on
the left and the right; the moderates in the centre (essentially the ruling
four-party coalition) will divide between those ready to govern with the
left and those ready to govern with the right.'
He has got a head start by laying the ground for such a coalition on the
left in local elections. He now has to mould this at the national level.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Berlusconi's broadcasts raise worries

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prominent Italian left-wing and centrist politicians yesterday warned
against the misuse of media power after Saturday's decision by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi to use his private television channels to broadcast a 90-minute
press conference outlining his political ambitions.
Prime-time viewers of Canale 5, the most popular of the three channels owned
by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group, were dumbfounded to find an advertised
feature film replaced by an unedited broadcast of Mr Berlusconi's political
debut before the foreign press association in Rome the previous day.
Earlier on Saturday, the schedule on Rete 4, another Fininvest channel, was
changed to make way for the same event. Together, the three Fininvest
channels regularly account for the lion's share of Italian viewing figures.
The summary use of the two channels confirmed fears among Mr Berlusconi's
critics, who last week warned of possible abuse of his media interests.
Yesterday, Mr Vincenzo Vita, of the left-wing Democratic Party of the Left,
said it highlighted the 'risks connected to Berlusconi's presence in
broadcasting'.
Mr Giorgio Napolitano, president of the lower house of parliament and a
senior member of the left-wing Democratic Party of the Left, pointed to the
risks inherent in any leading businessmen getting into politics. In such
circumstances, 'the institutions (of the state) must take responsibility to
guarantee the maximum balance in use of the media', he said.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Past and present woes combine to test Gaidar: John Lloyd
follows the advocate of reform on the campaign trail to Vorkuta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yegor Gaidar, fighting for the politics of reform against worsening polls
for his Russia's Choice party, at the weekend met a Soviet nightmare - and
one of his own.
The first deputy premier, campaigning for national elections on December 12,
arrived in the town of Vorkuta on Friday. Earlier in the week, he was mauled
by industrialists struggling with his market reforms in the city of
Ulyanovsk.
'At the beginning of the week we met the problems of the future,' said Mr
Alexei Ulukayev, a Gaidar adviser. 'Now we meet the problems of the past.'
It is a hideous past: the name of Vorkuta is a horror akin to Auschwitz.
Created in the 1930s by the secret police, Vorkuta had two functions: to
accommodate millions of political prisoners, and to mine in an area where
few would voluntarily work. The Vorkuta-Pechora basin - rich in coal, oil,
bauxite and precious metals - was opened up by convicts or zeks, who built
it in conditions which froze them alive when they dropped from exhaustion.
Nikita Khrushchev's liberation of the zeks in the mid-1950s meant the
replacement of coercion by attraction - the attraction of high salaries.
Miners' wages are now between Rbs200,000 and Rbs700,000 a month, at the top
of Russian state wages. The bargain has been that a worker prepared to stay
through winters where the temperature falls to -50 degrees, would get
relatively rich.
But the bargain is coming unstuck. Desperate for savings, the government has
cut regional subsidies which maintained pensions and benefits at between
one-third and one-half higher than in the rest of Russia. Mrs Marina
Sokolova, a miners' widow, had a cut in her pension from Rbs66,000 to
Rbs44,000 a month. 'I'm not used to living on that. We never had poor people
here, but now we have. They stand in the doorways of shops, out of the cold,
begging.'
Since autumn, the government has also delayed paying the miners' wages - by
up to three months. Vorkuta's 25,000 miners threatened to strike. The threat
is taken seriously by the government - even though this is not the major
coal-producing region of Russia and the miners are split. One pit has four
competing unions.
'When the unions went on strike in 1989, (Soviet premier Nikolai) Ryzhkov
fell,' says Mr Roman Siroziev, leader of the new independent union's strike
committee. 'When they went on strike in 1989, Gorbachev fell. Judge for
yourself.'
This is hyperbole, but with a basis in fact. The miners were promoted as the
proletarian vanguard in Soviet times, and their defection from communism and
support for Mr Boris Yeltsin was of huge importance for the latter's
presidency. They have been kept sweet since 1991 by big rises and by a
freeze on pit closures - meaning that pit subsidies now account for the
largest single expenditure in the budget. Their opposition during an
election would be a huge blow.
The Vorkuta men deny a political aim - in spite of gleeful headlines in the
opposition press declaring that they had demanded Mr Yeltsin's resignation.
'We have never said this,' says Mr Murat Bugulov, a leader of the new
independent union. 'We know the risk we run of helping the communists or
Zhirinovsky (neo-fascists) coming to power. But the government must fulfil
its responsibilities.'
Vorkuta is among the most extreme examples of resistance to market
economics. It produces for the state and is kept going by the state: any
enterprise beyond a small trading company would flee from the huge extra
costs of working in the Arctic. Mr Nikolai Pobov, a lawyer working for the
miners' unions, says that 'the miners helped create Yeltsin and supported
his reforms: now they find market reform is directly threatening their
interests'.
Mr Gaidar flew to this unpromising campaign opportunity through a snowstorm
last Friday night to meet leaders of the miners and heads of the republic of
Komi, where Vorkuta is situated. He came as a minister and as head of the
special commission on coal - an unwelcome responsibility dumped on him by Mr
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister - and not as a party leader. But in
practice these roles are now inseparable.
Late upon arrival, he was taken by bus to the biggest hall in town to take
his seat as guest of honour at a gala show - in celebration of the first
half century of the official existence of Vorkuta.
It was an uncomfortable event: not in itself, for it was well staged and
jolly, but for the echoes of the place's ghastly past which could not be
suppressed. A singer from the border guards (a KGB division) gave a fine
rendering of an awful song, 'Vorkuta is Vorkuta', which contained such
sentiments as 'the frost is cold' and 'our history is a sad one' juxtaposed
with 'but our hearts are warm' and 'we believe in our future'. It was the
leitmotif of the evening.
Mr Gaidar, in his obligatory speech, evoked the murderous past. But his
ending was upbeat - Vorkuta had a future, the lesson was to remove the
hopeless pits and enterprises and move to profitable production. He got mild
applause.
After his meetings with the miners on Saturday, Mr Gaidar claimed that he
had 'reached mutual understanding on many points' - which seemed to be code
for not reaching understanding on others. Mr Oleg Soskovets, another first
deputy premier, told the Interfax agency at the weekend that Rbs77bn had
been found to pay back wages - largely by squeezing back debts from the
steel plants.
On Saturday night, he flew on to Kuzbass - the larger coal basin in southern
Siberia, in which strike threats have also been made and to which Vorkuta
delegates have gone for support. A strike threat from last Wednesday still
stands - and talks between the national miners' leaders and Mr Gaidar resume
in Moscow today.
A patched solution is the best bet. But the past, and present, nightmare of
Vorkuta is not lightly exorcised. 'In the end,' says Mr Bugulov, 'they have
to decide: do they want us to exist or not. That's what it comes to.'

Taiwan's ruling nationalist party, the Kuomintang, did better than expected
in local government elections at the weekend, although its share of popular
vote fell below 50 per cent for the first time, writes Dennis Engbarth in
Taipei.
The elections, which had been seen as a test of the party's strength
following internal dissension and corruption scandals, appeared to bolster
the position of President Lee Teng-hui, who has led the island's democratic
reforms.
The Kuomintang held on to 13 county and city mayoral posts - the same number
as it had previously held. Candidates backed by the opposition Democratic
Progressive party (DPP) won six posts, a net loss of one seat.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Swiss vote in favour of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland's voters yesterday approved the introduction of a value added
tax, indicating a new willingness to align fiscal and economic policies with
those of other European countries. The majority for the introduction of VAT
was a surprisingly strong 65 per cent, and was unusually consistent across
the culturally diverse cantons.
On three previous occasions in the past two decades, the latest only two
years ago, Swiss voters rejected government proposals to replace an outmoded
goods turnover tax with a universal VAT.
However, the VAT issue had a more urgent context this year. Swiss companies
have complained of the excessive burden of the old goods tax at a time when
they faced increasing difficulties competing in European markets.
For its part, the government pleaded for a broader revenue base to meet its
increased responsibilities. Government spending has soared during the
recession, mainly to cover the costs of unemployment insurance. This in turn
reflects its more humane policy towards guest workers.
Government revenues have declined, with revenue from the goods tax falling
14 per cent. The federal deficit is likely to exceed SFr7bn (Pounds 3.1bn)
this year, more than double the initial estimate. The introduction of VAT is
estimated to bring in SFr1.7bn in new annual revenue.
Voters also replied positively to vigorous appeals from government leaders
for the higher of two VAT rates, opting for setting the VAT rate at 6.5 per
cent instead of the current 6.2 per cent for turnover tax.
There was also heavy backing for government advice to veto a proposal to ban
tobacco and liquor advertising, which was advanced by a petition supported
by Swiss doctors.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Shadow of Deng darkens hopes for democracy: The Chinese
leader has set the tone for talks on Hong Kong, which now seem to have
collapsed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pronouncements by China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, on Hong Kong may
not have quite the same messianic force as a fatwa issued by an Iranian
ayatollah but they have set the tone for an uncompromising Chinese position.
These include his warning in September 1982 to Lady Thatcher, then British
prime minister, that in the event of unrest in the colony during the
transition to 1997 China reserved the right to intervene.
He also urged that the two sides work closely to ensure a smooth transfer.
More importantly, he advised Britain's premier, fresh from her victory in
the Falklands war, that sovereignty was non-negotiable.
Chinese officials, taking their lead from Mr Deng's 'talk', have played
hardball over Hong Kong's future, first in negotiations on the Joint
Declaration of 1984 in which Britain ceded sovereignty, and subsequently in
discussions on the Basic Law - the colony's post-1997 constitution.
Mr Deng is also reported to have warned in conversation with colleagues that
Britain would resort to 'little tricks' aimed at muddying the waters in the
lead-up to 1997. Mr Patten's plans to broaden the franchise for elections in
Hong Kong appear, in the Chinese mind, to fall into this category. Beijing
insists that the Patten formula contradicts prior Sino-British agreements.
Mr Deng's Hong Kong fatwa has meant that from the beginning of Sino-British
negotiations over the Patten formula in April this year there has been
little room for compromise or manoeuvre. Britain's negotiators, in 17 rounds
of talks, have often felt they were talking to a brick wall.
Beijing has, on occasions, hinted at possible compromise, but suggestions of
flexibility have proved illusory. Officials have returned time and again to
a re-statement of basic principles which derive from the views expressed by
Mr Deng in his meeting with the then Mrs Thatcher.
Pointedly, Mr Deng's views on Hong Kong were published on the front pages of
Chinese newspapers on September 24, the day after Beijing failed to win the
nomination for the 2000 Olympics. This was seen as more than a coincidence
and appeared to reflect Beijing's displeasure over remarks by Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, in which he had forcefully championed Sydney's
bid. British officials in Beijing hope that in the Chinese way an 'eleventh
hour' compromise might be possible, but they also recognise that the signs
are not auspicious. Chinese officials have for weeks been canvassing
publicly the prospect of a breakdown of talks.
Mr Jiang Enzhu, a vice-foreign minister and China's chief negotiator, has
said that there are two possibilities: success or failure.
There is no doubt that China has been bolstered in its approach to the talks
by a feeling that it has not much to lose by refusing to budge: after all,
Hong Kong will return to Beijing's control in three and a half years
whatever Mr Patten's electoral arrangements.
No Chinese official would presume to contradict (or seek to reinterpret) Mr
Deng's edict. Indeed, Premier Li Peng in his National Day speech on October
1, noted that the 'recent publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important
talk on the Hong Kong problem has fully expressed our determination'.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Defiant China determined on a tame HK: Britain still hopes
for a negotiated deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When, in April, Britain and China embarked on talks about Hong Kong's
political development, their chance of reaching an agreement was never
bright. But the depth of division is underlined by the fact that the only
piece of common ground to emerge between the two after 160 hours of talks is
lowering the colony's voting age to 18 from 21 years.
Although Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, was quick yesterday to leave
the door open to further talks, the reality facing his administration and
the British government is that China will never agree to increasing
democratic participation in Hong Kong along Mr Patten's lines.
The immediate question for Mr Patten and his colleagues in the British
government is what to do next. The colony's Legislative Council (LegCo),
Hong Kong's 60-strong lawmaking body, will expect to hear how Britain plans
to proceed when the governor addresses Legco on Thursday.
The most likely outcome will be the splitting of Mr Patten's five proposals
for democratic reform - first made a year ago - into two bills.
The first - which may be presented to LegCo as early as December 8 - will
encompass the so-called 'simple' issues which Britain and China were unable
to agree on at the weekend. These are: abolishing appointments to Hong
Kong's district boards and municipal councils so that elections next year
will be fully democratic; creating 20 single-member electorates for the
LegCo elections in 1995; and lowering the voting age.
The second bill will consist of the more contentious aspects of Mr Patten's
plans. These are: broadening democratic participation in elections for 30
'functional' constituencies, which represent business and professional
interests; and the constitution of an 'electoral college' which will elect
10 LegCo members in 1995.
An important consideration for ministers is whether this second bill should
be Mr Patten's 1992 proposals unmodified, or the compromise offer the UK put
to China during the summer. This decision has yet to be taken but, in the
words of one of the governor's aides, 'If a process of mutilation is to take
place, better to start with a whole body rather than half.'
The speed of presentation of the second bill will be determined by China's
reaction to the tabling of the first. At the weekend Britain proposed an
18th round of talks to discuss the more difficult parts of Mr Patten's
plans. If, in the face of LegCo debating the first bill, China takes up that
offer then more time will be available for discussion.
The offer of more talks was mostly presentational but also reflected the
UK's unchanged policy towards relations with China. The prize still to be
fought for - which now appears to be beyond Britain's grasp - remains an
agreement.
Since the negotiation of the Joint Declaration between 1982 and 1984 the
cornerstone of British policy has been to agree 'transitional' issues with
the Chinese on the basis that what is agreed has a greater chance of
survival after 1997 than what is not.
It is far from clear, however, if China really wants an agreement on the
political transition of Hong Kong, or that Britain could live with what
China seeks. One thing which has emerged from the talks is that, in spite of
the neutering of Mr Patten's proposals during the summer, China was still
not satisfied.
The inescapable conclusion to draw from this is that China desires a tame
legislature in 1997, one which not only excludes so-called 'subversive'
democratic politicians, such as Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United
Democrats, but which restricts participation in elections.
The equally unpalatable fact for Mr Patten and the British government is
that when the governor's legislation gets to LegCo its members will probably
ensure that most of China's wishes are observed. LegCo is unlikely to agree
to broadening voter participation in the functional constituencies; it could
opt for appointment, rather than election, to the electoral college.
The current balance of power in LegCo suggests that its members are more
likely to vote in the direction of Beijing than of London. There are about
23 members who will support Mr Patten's democratic alternative and an equal
number who will do China's bidding. In the middle are 10 members - known as
the 'Breakfast Club' - most of whom when pushed will incline to Beijing on
the big issues.
Time has never been on Britain's side; less so now that Chinese resumption
of sovereignty is just 3 1/2 years away. But that reality cuts both ways:
China has a clearer idea of what is at stake for itself.
Possibly for that reason Mr Guo Fengmin, a senior Chinese government
official, said on Friday that if there were no agreement, 'the sky will not
fall down. We are confident that we, together with the Hong Kong people, can
maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.'

Hong Kong's business community last night shrugged off the apparent
breakdown in Anglo-Chinese talks about the colony's political future.
Governor Chris Patten has few allies among Hong Kong's Chinese and
expatriate businesses. Many feel that he is attempting to do too much, too
late in Britain's administration of Hong Kong.
Managers of some of the colony's largest companies said their view of Hong
Kong as a place to invest would not be affected even if China stood by its
threat to overturn the results of the colony's 1995 elections when it
assumes sovereignty on July 1 1997.
According to one senior British businessman: 'It is not that there would be
rioting and upheaval if they did that. Hong Kong people are quite pragmatic.
There may be a lot of words and shouting but they know there's nothing to be
gained. No one will come to rescue them from the Motherland (China).'
However, not all business people think that the current Anglo-Chinese fight
over Hong Kong is wasted. One leading Chinese businessman praised Mr Patten
for bringing the issue of Hong Kong's political development in to the open.
'It is better for Hong Kong if we get this settled once and for all now,' he
said. 'It would be worse for us if this debate took place after 1997.
'The extent to which Hong Kong can maintain its independence will depend on
how Hong Kong people act, not on what the British do,' he said.
Most businessmen believe that Hong Kong can have a good relationship with
China only if it works with Beijing rather than confront it. However they
are confident that China will not damage Hong Kong's economy in reprisal for
what Mr Patten has done.
Traders in Hong Kong's volatile stock market believe that the market has
already substantially discounted failure in the talks and Mr Patten putting
his proposals to the colony's legislature.
The market will be focusing on what the Chinese government says if Mr Patten
does take unilateral action. Here the key will be the nature of threats, if
any, Beijing makes about the economy.
'The market is likely to suffer increased selling pressure but I don't think
investors will be too pessimistic at this stage,' said Mr Simon Lam of
Mansion House Securities.
'Even if a first-stage agreement cannot be reached it does not mean that
there will be no talks in the future, so I don't think the market will
correct very substantially,' he said.
Indeed analysts said a correction was long overdue after the strong gains of
the past few months.
The Hang Seng index edged higher last week, gaining just 10.48 points over
the week to 9,274.42 on Friday.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Taiwan party stands firm

Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party failed to suffer an expected setback in
local government elections at the weekend, although its share of the popular
vote fell below 50 per cent for the first time.
The elections, which had been seen as a key test of the party's strength
following internal dissension and corruption scandals, appeared to bolster
the position of President Lee Teng-hui, who has led the island's democratic
reforms.
The Kuomintang held on to 13 county and city mayoral posts - the same number
as it had previously held. Candidates backed by the opposition Democratic
Progressive party (DPP) won six posts, a net loss of one seat. The two
others went respectively to a pro-DPP independent and a pro-KMT independent.
Mr Hsu Hsin-liang, the DPP chairman, resigned to take responsibility for the
setback and attributed the defeat to 'unprecedented levels' of vote- buying
by KMT candidates, as well as to the impact made by President Lee, who as
KMT chairman undertook an unprecedented personal campaign swing across
Taiwan.
However, the electorate gave the KMT only 47 per cent of 7.6m votes cast,
down from 54 per cent in similar mayoral elections in 1989. The DPP, which
advocates formal independence for Taiwan and social reform policies, gained
41 per cent, up from 38 per cent in 1989.
The Chinese New party, a breakaway from the KMT, received only 3 per cent.
The rest went to independents.
Mr Hsu Shui-teh, KMT secretary-general, said: 'In an international
environment in which many ruling parties are being turned out of office, we
cannot say that to retain the same number of 13 mayoral seats was a loss.'
Mr Hsu of the DPP said Mr Lee was now in a position to step up plans to push
through a constitutional amendment for direct presidential elections and run
for the post himself.
But he said Mr Lee 'had expended much political capital' by exposing himself
to criticism from the DPP in the campaign and would enjoy less political
momentum going into a presidential race.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Budget plan for sale of 70,000 defence homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, plans to sell off nearly 70,000
houses occupied by armed forces personnel to offset the deep cuts imposed by
the Treasury in the Pounds 23bn defence budget.
The scheme, due to be announced as part of the Budget tomorrow, is expected
to raise about Pounds 500m in the financial year beginning April 1995 and
will go into current spending on the defence budget.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is expected by City economists to
increase taxes by up to Pounds 2bn from next April, on top of the Pounds
6.7bn already announced. He may also announce cuts of Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn
in the Treasury's previously published Pounds 254bn control total for public
spending in 1994-95. The chancellor's main preoccupation will be to reduce
the Pounds 50bn fiscal deficit without jeopardising signs of economic
recovery.
The services housing sales are seen by ministers as a crucial element in
attempts to fight off a threatened rebellion by backbench Tory MPs over the
scale of forthcoming defence cuts.
The scheme also marks the start of a wave of new asset sales planned by
Whitehall departments to square the circle of the sharpest squeeze for a
decade on public spending with commitments to preserve crucial budgets.
But the Treasury's approval for Mr Rifkind's plan to plough back the
receipts into current spending on the defence budget has sparked resentment
among other senior ministers.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has protested that local
authorities which transfer their housing stock to private sector housing
associations are not given similar freedom to spend the receipts.
Mr Rifkind's scheme centres on nearly 70,000 'married quarters' properties
in Britain occupied by defence personnel. More than half - around 35,000 -
are owned by the army, with the air force accounting for about 25,000 and
the navy about 10,000.
Under the proposals, the properties will be transferred via a non-profit
trust to housing associations, building societies and other interested
groups.
Purchasers will be granted a long lease, probably 99 years, on the
properties, which will be occupied by service families at rents determined
by the Armed Services Pay Review Body.
Potential buyers will be able to finance the relatively cheap leases through
guaranteed rents from reliable tenants.
Separately the defence ministry is selling off housing left vacant by the
run-down in the size of the armed forces. Over 4,000 properties have been
sold outright under that scheme.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Patten set to urge start on Hong Kong electoral reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, is tomorrow expected to recommend to
the British government that the colony should go ahead with the first stage
of its controversial electoral reform legislation.
His advice will follow Chinese accusations that Britain was responsible for
what it called the 'failure' of the latest round of talks on the future of
Hong Kong.
A terse dispatch carried by the official Xinhua news agency said the
breakdown had occurred in spite of China's 'best and thorough efforts' to
reach agreement.
It was Beijing's first official comment on the 17th round of talks, which
ended on Saturday in Beijing.
Mr Patten and his executive council will meet tomorrow to consider pushing
ahead with democracy legislation despite the apparent breakdown.
China, which takes over the running of Hong Kong in 1997, has denounced Mr
Patten's plans to broaden the franchise for local and Legislative Council
(LegCo) elections due in 1994 and 1995. Britain had hoped to reach a
first-stage agreement on less contentious issues, such as local government
elections due next year.
The governor, who described the latest session as 'another sad and
disappointing round', said the door remained open for further talks. He said
he still hoped it was possible to reach agreement.
'We are not walking away from any negotiating table; what we are doing is
walking firmly in the direction of our responsibilities and that we'll
continue to do,' Mr Patten said.
But negotiations, which began in April, are at an impasse, with both sides
claiming they can go no further. Although Britain offered an 18th round,
western officials in Beijing say it is ominous that, for the first time, the
talks ended without an undertaking to meet again.
Mr Patten is likely to face tough questioning when he addresses the
Legislative Council on Thursday.
Mr Yeung Sum, a leading pro-democracy activist, called on both sides to be
more open. 'They should come out and explain to the people of Hong Kong why
there isn't another round of talks. Does that mean that the talks have come
to a stop or not?' he asked.
British officials said Beijing had hardened its position in the past two
rounds, after appearing willing to compromise. One Hong Kong official said:
'There is a feeling of irritation bordering on anger about what they did
between the 15th and 16th rounds.'
This is a reference to Beijing's withdrawal of a compromise which would have
allowed the Hong Kong government to legislate some parts of Mr Patten's
proposal while leaving others for future talks.
During the summer, Britain retreated from Mr Patten's original proposals for
Hong Kong's democratic development, but to date the Chinese government has
made no commensurate move.

FT  29 NOV 93 / Business leaders say chance of settlement must not be missed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading businessmen in Northern Ireland believe the province has a unique
opportunity for lasting peace that should not be missed.
They believe Sinn Fein, the political wing of the provisional IRA, will have
to be drawn into talks once it has renounced violence to make a political
settlement possible.
Interviews over the past week with executives at the top 50 companies in
Northern Ireland found most broadly support London and Dublin's efforts to
reach a settlement.
They warned that failure would risk an upsurge of violence with damaging
consequences for the economy. A number of the province's leading businessmen
believe that an eventual unification of Ireland could be acceptable if there
are economic and business dividends from a peace settlement.
Business leaders in Northern Ireland have traditionally been reluctant to be
drawn into the political debate for fear of becoming targets of terrorist
attacks. Their decision to break their silence underlines the importance
attached to peace efforts at a time when businesses are threatened by
terrorism on the one hand and recession on the other.
Sir George Quigley, chairman of Ulster Bank, said: 'The two governments
should work closely together and all concerned grasp the sense of urgency .
. . there is a need to act now and not just drift for another 12 months
which would lead to a repetition of the violence of the last 25 years. This
is a turning-point.'
Mr Edward Wilson, managing director of Ulster Carpets, said there was a
great desire for peace. 'I would be quite happy as an industrialist to work
in a united Ireland or within the UK . . . given the right political
institutions and the right economic support from the EC, there is no reason
why Ireland should not operate as a single political and economic entity.'
Mr Trevor Campbell, managing director of Moy Park, a leading food processor,
commented: 'No one is in any doubt that a cessation of violence would help
the economic climate generally. I don't want a temporary ceasefire but a
permanent one. If the government can get a devolved administration in
Northern Ireland, this will help business.'
Mr Georges Senninger, managing director of Montupet, a French motor
components company based in Belfast, said: 'Every time we try and sell
something the 'troubles' factor comes into play. The IRA is part of the
landscape here, you have to take them into account. I don't think it is
possible to have a political settlement without them.'
Mr Alex Bell, director of Castlecourt Investments, which runs Belfast's main
shopping centre, said: 'The government is totally on the right track by
trying to bring about a settlement, although we cannot have peace at any
price. It is inevitable that Sinn Fein will be included in the political
process . . . but there is an essential criterion prior to that happening.
This would involve the complete cessation of violence.'
Mr Sean O'Dwyer, chief executive of Desmond and Sons, a Londonderry clothing
manufacturer employing 2,700 people and the second biggest manufacturer in
the province, agreed that Sinn Fein would have to be at the negotiating
table 'but only after a cessation of violence'.
Mr Ian Young, managing director of a Derry electrical contractor, said: 'I
believe a united Ireland will eventually come about. Unionists should be
negotiating from a position of strength now, to get the best possible terms
and guarantees. Politicians are going to have to grasp the nettle and all
will get stung.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Just who is taking the Mickey? - Dominic Lawson explains why
Europeans want to wash that mouse right out of their hair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago, I sat at a table basking in the late autumn heat of inland
Florida. Unfortunately I was unable to nod off, or to become pleasantly
squiffy on one of those wonderful long American cocktails. The trouble was
there were three other men around the table: big serious business
executives, with big serious plans which they wanted to show me.
They reminded me of those diagrams one used to see during the cold war, of
the effects of a nuclear bomb in the heart of London: the blob in the middle
would be the impact in Whitehall, and the rings blossoming out denoted
diminishing degrees of carnage.
These maps also charted flows of population and vulnerability, but to
something else: the power of Mickey Mouse, and, in particular to Mickey's
new site, then being planned at EuroDisney.
The three executives were from the Disney corporation and were attempting to
show me the ideal suitability of northern France for their first venture
into theme parks outside the motherland. The rings denoted population
density, and speed of population movement. I forget now how many millions of
people they claimed were within four hours travelling of EuroDisney - thanks
to the wonderful TGV - but it was a number which, if these men had been
characters in a Disney cartoon, would have turned their eyes into cash
registers.
In part they were trying to convince me, a British journalist, that the
outskirts of Paris was, on purely objective grounds, a far better site then
anything that Britain could offer. I assured them that I was not in the
least offended, and nor were the people of Britain. As it turned out, the
people who were offended were the Spanish, but their government could not
afford the - entirely legal - financial inducements offered by France.
Now we are all, particularly the investors in Euro-Disney, much wiser. It is
not just the lack of sufficient passing trade that is the problem. It seems
that Europeans find the working practices of the Disney corporation rather
too onerous. A number of these disgruntled employees have gone into print on
the matter: in Friday's Daily Telegraph one Christin Ruble, who gave up
after only eight weeks, complained that 'We were remade in Walt's image'
(although I think she looked sweet in the accompanying photograph, wearing
her Mickey Mouse hat).
If Miss Ruble had been reading my column more attentively, she could have
spared herself the embarassment. As I reported 18 months ago, on that trip
to Florida, I stumbled across a document setting out the dress code for
employees. They made the British army seem lax. So as a service to
similarly-minded potential employees, I will quote it again: from the
section headed 'Women: Hair'. It stipulated, among other things: 'Hair below
shoulder length should be worn combed away from the face so that it will not
fall forward or over the face when performing normal job duties. Side
tendrils, if worn, should not extend below the bottom of the ear lobe. If a
yarn or hair ribbon is worn it should be no wider than one half inch, or
longer than four inches when tied. Stick-pin barrettes (both leather and
plastic), and knitted chinon (bun) holders are not acceptable.'
The 'Men: Hair' section was scarcely less strict, and, among many other
points, it demanded that: 'Sideburns should be neatly trimmed and may be
permitted to extend to the bottom of the ear lobe, following their natural
contour. Flares or muttonchops are not permitted'.
Americans seem happy to put up with such rules. Theirs is a society which
not only tolerates homogenisation, but worships it. But we in Europe are
quaintly obsessed with individualism, particularly in matters of dress and
appearance.
The Americans also are happy queueing. I was amazed, in Florida, to see
families standing for two hours to spend a minute on some new attraction. I
could never see that happening in northern Europe. But the reason was not
anthropological. It was the weather. It was simply too cold or wet, most of
the year, for any sane family to want to queue. That is a point which it
never occurred to me to put to those Disney executives five years ago, as we
sat in our shirt sleeves in the heat of Florida in October.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Permanent interest-bearing shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of Pibs have not changed greatly since the FT last published the
table on October 23, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Simon Mozley, of Hoare
Govett, attributes the market's relative lack of activity to investors
awaiting the Budget.
Pibs are fixed interest-paying instruments issued by building societies and
income usually is paid twice a year. They offer higher yields than gilts
because of their higher risk: societies are less secure than the government.
Gains from Pibs are exempt from capital gains tax unless they are bought in
a fund.
Mozley believes this week's base rate cut will have a beneficial effect on
Pibs: 'The prospects for greater profitability by societies was enhanced by
the recent cut in interest rates. Not only should this provide an incentive
to the housing market but it will also allow societies to manage their
interest margins to a greater extent. This should be good news for Pibs
investors as performances improve.'
On balance, the higher the Pibs' yield, the riskier the society is deemed to
be by the market. Thus, both Halifax building society issues have the lowest
yield in the table. But since these are in denominations of Pounds 50,000,
few private investors are likely to be attracted to them. Mozley believes
that 'both First National and Bristol &amp; West have underperformed the market
and there is scope for further improvements here.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Labour warns on Welsh agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday claimed the government was putting the future of the Welsh
Development Agency in question because of asset sales and cuts in its grant.
The party was setting out a new agenda for the agency in the wake of the
highly critical Commons Public Accounts Committee report earlier this year.
Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, and Mr Rhodri Morgan, frontbench
spokesman on Wales, welcomed the WDA's new chairman, Mr David Rowe-Beddoe,
and what they described as the board's 'swift no-nonsense disciplinary
action'. They added: 'We hope a line can now be drawn under this episode.'
They told a Commons press conference a much bigger shadow was now being cast
over its future.
They said: 'By forcing the agency to sell off land and factories on a
massive scale, and by cutting its government grant, John Redwood (Welsh
secretary) has thrown the WDA's whole existence into question.'
While this year, they said, the agency was committed to a budget of Pounds
171m, 'less than half the budget, Pounds 78m, is from Welsh Office coffers.
The WDA has to raise Pounds 50m from land disposals and Pounds 29m from land
rental to make up the programme. Projections for next financial year make
grim reading.'
Mr Davies and Mr Morgan called for the WDA to be given a clear development
strategy and a secure financial plan. The agency should be rebuilt as 'the
engineroom of the Welsh economy' with less emphasis on inward investment and
more on indigenous investment, and freed 'from the political stranglehold of
the Welsh Office'.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Doubts cast on Matrix trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior civil servant yesterday cast doubt on the basis of the
Matrix-Churchill trial concerning exports of arms to Iraq, which led to the
establishment of the Scott inquiry. He admitted that the case, which
collapsed in November 1992, could have been 'blown out of the water' before
it went ahead.
The admission emerged as the Scott inquiry began to focus upon one of the
prime arguments used by Customs and Excise to mount their prosecution
against three executives of Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands machine tool
manufacturer.
The Old Bailey prosecution hinged on a contention by Customs and Excise,
based on documents and specifications obtained at the factory, that the
machines were dedicated to military manufacturing.
Lord Justice Scott suggested during the inquiry that both military and
industrial lists used by the Department of Trade and Industry to draw
distinctions between uses when considering export applications could have
covered machines that had such special design features. Because there was no
requirement to state the specific end use of the machines on the export
licence application, the distinction between military and industrial use
could not readily be drawn.
Mr Eric Beston, head of the DTI's export control branch from 1985 to 1990,
said in evidence: 'That is something I have never thought about. That could
perfectly well have blown the Customs case out of the water.' He added: 'I
wish I had thought about that at the time.'
Earlier Mr Beston told the hearing that he believed the argument that the
tools were specially designed was based on a narrow technical approach which
he had not experienced previously. While he admitted he was familiar with
the 'special design' concept, he said he believedand 'no doubt made aware'
to Customs that they had taken 'a rather technical approach to the framing
of the action'.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Sanctions spawn a new Bedlam in Serbia: Laura Silber finds
medieval conditions in a psychiatric hospital deprived of modern drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Toponica, Serbia's largest psychiatric hospital, even the silent,
skeletal faces shriek.
Day after day, patients shrunken by starvation, cold and infections, shiver
and die beneath grey blankets, two dozen in the last fortnight, hospital
workers said.
Corpses decay as the staff search in vain for relatives who can afford the
burial expenses.
The living spend their days sitting in their own excrement as hospital
workers, with no drugs to administer, stand by helpless.
Few people can even travel to Toponica because petrol is in short supply and
public transport has been slashed since the United Nations imposed economic
sanctions on Serbia for lending military and economic support to the Serbs
carving up Bosnia.
Toponica is not an island of horror; it is but one gruesome sample of the
crisis consuming the former Yugoslavia. Mr Sven Lampell, Belgrade head of
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)
says donor countries are 'prejudiced', reluctant to give aid to the remnants
of Yugoslavia, whose leaders have been branded the chief instigators of the
war.
He fears Serbia will be unable to cope with the economic collapse. The
stench and squalor of Toponica are evidence of his grim view. An IFRC doctor
estimates that at least 200 patients are at risk of imminent death, but
warns of similar cases elsewhere.
Toponica is Bedlam, the word coined from the Bethlehem Royal Hospital
established in 1547 in London. Only centuries later did anti-psychotic drugs
subdue the tumult. The 1,600 psychiatric patients, 400 more than the maximum
legal capacity, have fallen between the cracks of a society caving in. The
inmates are undergoing a cruel experiment, deprived of drugs, food and
heating.
A hospital doctor puts it bluntly: 'We have gone back in time 50 years at
Toponica.' And by western standards, hospital conditions in Yugoslavia
before the Second World War were almost medieval.
The story of Toponica is filled with villains and heroes. Mrs Nadica Radic,
a seemingly tireless head nurse, and a team of medical technicians, are
heroes, especially given their average monthly wage equivalent to DM3.
Until last week, Serbian authorities ignored the pleas of Mrs Radic about
the plight of the hospital. Now they have seized on Toponica as yet another
example of the 'injustice' of sanctions.
While the embargo is the scapegoat for everything gone wrong in Serbia, this
institution also exposes the legacy of communist disregard for psychiatric
care. Serb officials blame the sanctions for the acute shortage of medicines
but a Belgrade pharmacist say neuroleptic drugs are available, 'but you just
need to have money', he adds.
In a state whose leaders seem immune to the suffering of the population,
psychiatric patients rank at the bottom of the agenda because they pose no
threat to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
With resources wanting in Serbia, local relief officials spar over scraps of
aid. Dr Radomir Krstic, president of the Red Cross in nearby Nis, 180 miles
southeast of Belgrade, appeals for help for the Nis children's clinic,
dismissing the patients of Toponica. 'They are just idiots, they need drugs,
not clothes.'
Four lorries carrying emergency aid have been despatched to Toponica. But
Handicap International, a Paris-based aid organisation, says a Dollars 2.5m
emergency aid package for Serbian centres serving disabled populations is
necessary to meet the bare minimum.
But two years of war, the UN sanctions and corruption have emptied the state
coffers, on one hand, while war profiteering and sanctions busting, on the
other hand, have made Belgrade's power brokers and protected crime figures
rich.
Mrs Radic points to stacks of wood, cut from the snow-covered grounds at
Toponica. This hospital and scores of other institutions in the shattered
former federation are the quiet casualties of the war.
'These people are the least to blame. They cannot defend themselves,' she
says.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Private View: When philosophy is kids' stuff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Socrates was condemned to death for corrupting the youth of Athens. What
sentence, then, would be appropriate for people caught teaching philosophy
to five-year-olds?
Karin Murris, a Dutch philosopher, thinks metaphysics could be the saving of
English education.
She was born (where else?) in the Spinoza Clinic, Spinoza Street, Amsterdam,
and studied at the famous University of Leyden. She says that unless
children are taught to think, they cannot learn. Unless they are taught to
scrutinise everything thrown at them by parents, pedagogues, politicians and
the press, they cannot develop into good citizens.
Her diagnosis could strike a chord in a country constantly bemoaning the
failure of its state education - perhaps, too, with a prime minister whose
slogan is 'back to basics'.
But, I asked her, do we really want to raise a generation of little
sceptics?
Philosophy means freedom, she replied. 'It gives you choice: not being stuck
with what is, but learning to formulate what could be. It is questioning.
When you feel satisfied, you make up your mind - temporarily - but keep an
open-minded attitude. I don't believe that is a bad thing for children.'
Even in moral matters?
Many teachers, she agreed, consider it their first duty to tell children
what is right and wrong, what good and bad. 'But it's not as simple as that.
Children are constantly being taught moral values, anyway. It's only an
assumption that they cannot probe further. If you teach answers, and teach
dogmatically, they won't have the concepts to heart. If they haven't thought
it through for themselves, do you think they will obey?'
Questioning should start from an early age because beliefs can petrify into
prejudice and prejudice can lead to violence. 'For instance, religion has
been used - I am not saying it is inherent in religion - to justify
violence.'
Karin Murris does not look like a poisoner of tiny minds. She has a gentle
voice, easy manner and mischievous eyes. She lives with her English husband
in a smart big bungalow in Berkshire, from where she runs her Centre for
Philosophy with Children. And she has children of her own: a son and
daughter, both at a local state school, and a baby on the way.
'With my own children, I am always clear about the values I think
important,' she said. 'There are a lot of rules you need to make living as a
family possible.'
Children should challenge authority - not the law, the police or their
teachers, but epistemological authority: where do our beliefs come from? How
do I justify them? 'You can be very sceptical about the origin of belief and
the possibility of true knowledge without . . .' She paused.
Becoming an anarchist?
'Exactly.'
There is no count of British schools that have tried teaching children
philosophy but the idea is not new. It began 20 years ago in the US when
Matthew Lipman, a university philosophy professor and guru of the movement,
had a bright idea for engaging the minds of no-hopers from city ghettoes. It
is now taught in 5,000 schools there and has spread to 35 other countries.
It seems to be particularly popular in eastern Europe, Russia and South
America.
Lipman and his disciples use philosophical novels of the professor's own
composition (the first, punningly titled Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery, was
on logic) to provoke disciplined debate between children on a topic of their
own choosing. Murris follows Lipman's method but uses different material.
Being herself mainly a product of the continental tradition of philosophy,
she is unhappy with some of the Lipmanite doctrines.
I asked her if there was an age below which children were incapable of
philosophising.
'I don't think so. As soon as they can talk, they come up with the most
amazing questions. Infants are very open and sparkling and very creative in
their thinking. The older they get, the more closed down the answers become.
If you don't start young, you have missed most people.'
She recalled conducting a class of middle-class 10-year-olds: 'They were as
good as gold, honestly. But they couldn't formulate questions. They just
didn't want to explore ideas.'
Do boys and girls think differently?
'I haven't noticed it.'
How many women philosophers have there been?
There was a reproving silence. 'That's a rhetorical question, not an
open-ended question.' Then she decided I was joking and laughed merrily.
'There've been so many: you're just not aware of them] But it's the same as
in history, sciences, everything. Why did the Dutch produce so many good
philosophers and painters?'
It is often said that men are better at sequential thinking, women at
intuitive, lateral thinking.
'I don't know. This left-brain, right-brain thing assumes a mechanistic view
of the mind, anyway. Philosophy deals with both. You think with your guts,
too. Scientists working on projects for 10 or 20 years feel in their guts
that something is there. Philosophy is very much a passionate affair. It's a
passion for thinking. You are constantly in motion. That's why you can never
'be wise'.'
Are there forbidden topics?
None, she said, unless schools ban discussion of sex without parental
permission. Children had fewer taboos than adults. They needed to talk about
death, for example, and could spot the difference between 'suicide' and
'killing yourself'. Sometimes, racism crops up.
'It's wonderful when it comes up in philosophy because then you neutralise
the whole thing: 'Why did you say that?' You have to justify. As soon as
prejudices come to the surface ,they can be dealt with - by the children.'
Don't you get complaints from the parents?
'It's funny, but I haven't had a single one. Children seem to know when they
can or can't say certain things. They're very clever.'
Murris said philosophy does not subvert the rest of the curriculum but
complements it. Do you mean, I said, that it is the sub-structure?
'Absolutely. That's a lovely way of putting it: it is the sub-structure.
Philosophy is the fourth R - reasoning - that underlies the three Rs.'
Why hasn't it been taught in schools before, then?
She replied by referring to historical fashion and to wrong assumptions
about children's powers of reason. Thinking of the present backlash against
so-called child-centred education in Britain, I asked her if she was
'progressive'.
'Oh, I hate labels] No, I'm a philosopher. I think all philosophers are
progressive, anyway.'
Are you just putting forward in a more systematic way the ideals of
child-centred education which - so it appears - teachers have shown
themselves unable to deliver?
'Well, of course it's child-centred because you believe they can think for
themselves. But I don't think one excludes the other.
'You can't say you want a society where citizens are assumed to think for
themselves, to vote, formulate opinions, digest all the information, and
then teach them not to do so.' Philosophy should be part of every teacher's
education.
Studies in the US have given some support to the movement's claim that
philosophy accelerates children's reading ability and mental age. Lipman
points to successes with drop-out teenagers in New Jersey.
Murris is careful not to make large claims for it, but has seen its
beneficial effect on truants and disruptive children. Giving them permission
to express their own opinions raises their self-esteem - and low self-esteem
is cited often these days as a cause of addiction to drugs and violence.
'The older I get, the more I realise how limited our thinking is and what we
can grasp with it,' Murris said, finally.
'Philosophy gives you another perspective on life, and the more perspectives
you have, the richer a person you are. The aim of education is not just to
teach this or that subject. It is all about choices, ideas. What sort of
life do you want to live? What sort of person do you want to become?
'We always assume we remain the same person, that we have to have some
coherent life story. But is there such a thing? We are constantly becoming
the person we want to be. So, there is no harm at all in teaching children
they are not stuck.
'You can only hope they take out what you value. But, at the end of the day,
it's their decision. In a society that is rapidly changing, we haven't got a
clue what our children will need in 10 or 20 years' time, do we - what
knowledge, what sort of skills?
'But thinking soundly about these things is, I think, the best thing you can
give them: about what they hear, what they see on television, what they read
in the newspapers.' She smiled wickedly. 'Including the Financial Times.'
A glass of champagne, not hemlock, I think, for Karin Murris. But how many
teachers wrestling to instil the three Rs will be capable of delivering the
fourth?

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Hitting the right note to fill the seats - The
marketing strategies of London's opera houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many people can whistle the airs from Smetana's opera The Two Widows. By
all accounts it is a jolly, tuneful, light opera, ideal for the Christmas
trade. But English National Opera knows it cannot fill the vast 2,358 seat
Coliseum with such a little known work without a considerable marketing
effort. It is contemplating playing the music down telephone lines so that
anyone who needs convincing that they will enjoy it can get a taster.
There will also be a special offer, four seats for the price of three, to
encourage celebratory parties. The same deal will cover the other holiday
production, Die Fledermaus. It is all part of the ENO's intensified effort
to sell more seats. In recent years its audience has declined inexorably, to
63 per cent of capacity last season.
As the London theatre belatedly feels the effects of the recession (West End
ticket sales are down 1 per cent on last year), the two opera houses, the
ENO and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, are looking towards
imaginative marketing schemes to attract audiences and shore up revenue.
They are well aware that declining attendances hardly help their case for
more subsidy from the Arts Council.
But while the two Houses consider plans to build audiences they are well
aware of the pitfalls. Both have loyal, bedrock, supporters (who rarely
overlap). They are terrified that embracing cut price promotions and special
offers with too much enthusiasm will alienate their regular patrons and
increase the current curse of the West End - last minute bookings.
The Royal Opera House experienced the problem recently when, to fill some
unsold capacity, it offered 13 seats for Eugene Onegin, ranging in price up
to Pounds 85, for just Pounds 15 to members of its staff, and to the staff
of the Royal Academy, with which it has friendly links. News of the
promotion leaked out and the box office was busy placating opera lovers
seeking similar treatment. The aim is to dispose of empty seats without
upsetting traditional subscribers. At all costs the two Houses want to avoid
introducing a bucket-shop image to a trip to the opera or ballet.
ENO and Covent Garden are taking different approaches to the same end.
Although the ENO does make 58 seats available on the day at discount prices
(Pounds 18 for the stalls; Pounds 6 for the gallery), and carries special
offers for less popular operas through commercial radio and magazines like
Time Out, its ambition is to sell more seats through attracting new
audiences rather than reducing seat prices to its existing one. It is
working on a special promotion which will offer discounts to schools and to
community groups.
This has yet to be launched. In the meantime the ENO will continue to target
certain markets for particular productions that need help at the box office.
There is no need to cut prices on its new La Boheme, which the other
Saturday played to 105 per cent capacity thanks to an influx of standing
room only aficionados. But the juxtaposition in the repertory of Figaro's
Wedding and The Barber of Seville, which share at least one character in
common, made it seem natural to offer a discount on the Rossini opera to
buyers of Figaro tickets.
Another recent production, Street Scene, is virtually unknown despite its
origin as a Broadway musical. The ENO took a mailing shot to First Call
subscribers, pushing its history as a 20th century musical. It also made a
media drive for radio producers, giving them complimentary seats in the hope
that the tuneful songs would later feature on their play lists. But
discounting is perilous. The ENO much prefers to encourage its core audience
by offering a free 24 hour booking service and discounts in car parking
until it gets the major promotion aimed at new audiences off the ground.
The need to boost ENO attendances has been intensified by the success of
Covent Garden. In September Covent Garden launched a guaranteed ticket for
Pounds 10 in a promotion with the FT. This attracted 17,000 responses, and
will dispose of most of the unsold seats in the current season. The first
performance of a triple bill of three modern ballets, a notoriously
difficult programme to sell, was packed, thanks to 200 FT readers in the
audience.
Covent Garden is less concerned to develop new audiences. It fulfils its
commitment to access through broadcasting, and the Midland Bank Proms and
simultaneous screenings on the piazza. With its average seat price much
higher than that at the Coliseum it sees little potential in marketing
itself to schools or community groups.
It also has two advantages over its rival down the road. It has fewer empty
seats to fill - last season its dance performances had a capacity of 87 per
cent and opera 85 per cent. And it has more flexibility over its
programming: ENO would find it financially counter-productive to cancel
performances of an unpopular opera production but Covent Garden can switch
its dance programmes, as it did last season when more offerings of Tales of
Beatrix Potter were slotted in at the expense of the ailing Prince of the
Pagodas.
Covent Garden is also working on a long term solution to lifting audiences.
It is based on the frequent flier schemes of airlines. As you buy tickets
you acquire points, and points can be converted into seats. Of course
certain, more challenging, productions earn more points than others. The aim
is to deliver audiences of around 92 per cent of capacity, and the promotion
is likely to come into force next season, building on the databank of
potential new supporters that the Royal Opera gained through the FT
promotion.
Both Houses have improved their financial position in recent years by
cutting costs. But they still have substantial deficits. With the near
certainty that the Arts Council will have to reduce its subsidy by 2 per
cent next year, it is more vital than ever that box office revenue is
increased. The secret lies in finding an approach which boosts income
without discounting the value of the product.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: A gift to posterity - Paul Sacher, musical pioneer and
patron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The house has an elegant stone facade, one side overlooking Basle's
cathedral square, the other the River Rhine. Inside, the design blends
modern practicality with clean, classical lines. No expense has been spared.
In the reading rooms, musicologists study autograph scores on microfilm. In
the vault-like safe, librarians methodically sift through manuscripts. The
Paul Sacher Foundation, inaugurated in 1986, is going about its work.
This is Paul Sacher's gift to posterity. The 87-year old Swiss musician, who
conducts the London Mozart Players at the Queen Elizabeth Hall next
Wednesday, has spent his life commissioning and performing new music. Now he
has gathered it together as a 20th century archive. The starting point was
his own priceless collection of scores, bolstered by his purchase of the
Stravinsky estate in 1983. Then came the complete Webern manuscripts,
followed by a steady flow of material from Berio, Birtwistle, Boulez,
Dutilleux, Henze, Ligeti and others. The collection grows every week -
negotiations are currently under way to buy John Cage's estate - and will
soon need expanded premises. The only major gaps are Schoenberg and Berg.
Paul Sacher is a living legend. The son of a Basle gardener, he studied
violin, founded the Basle Chamber Orchestra in 1926, married the widow of
the head of the Hoffmann-La Roche chemical company, and used the family
fortune to commission more than 200 works - among them Bartok's Music for
Percussion, Strings and Celesta and other modern classics by Hindemith,
Honegger, Martinu and Frank Martin. These compositions were not simply
ordered and paid for: in many cases, Sacher befriended the composer, put the
spacious surroundings of his country home at their disposal, offered
encouragement and watched the work develop. Then he would conduct the first
performance (and often the second and third . . . ). How different from
today's cultural sponsors]
Perhaps it is his progressive, open-minded spirit that has kept Sacher so
young. Another source of vitality is his 12-year old son, whose mother - a
young medical scientist - died of cancer in 1989, a few months before
Sacher's wife died at the age of 93. He still leads a remarkably active
life. Although he played a key role during and after the war in the growth
of Hoffmann-La Roche (in which, thanks to his initiative, his family gained
a majority shareholding), business interests now play second fiddle to the
foundation. He receives guests in his apartment at the top of the building,
where the rooms - decorated with paintings by Picasso, Chagall, Modigliani
and others - bear testimony to his wife's lifelong patronage of 20th century
art.
Did he have a plan, a mission, from the start? 'I knew exactly what I
wanted. I had my own orchestra at school, I wanted to be a conductor. I
wanted to do old music, I wanted to do new music, I wanted to do unknown
things - anything but the pieces which were repeated over and over again at
concerts. I wanted to hear the voice of our time, how a man living today
composes music. For me, the most important musician is the composer.
'When I started the Basle Chamber Orchestra, we had no money. That didn't
stop me inviting Stravinsky and Hindemith to come and conduct their music.
If I asked a composer to write a piece, he immediately agreed. He knew me
and my orchestra, the quality and competence, and said yes with pleasure.
Today's composers have lists of commissions and not enough time to fulfil
them. In 1926, there were hardly any chamber orchestras - today there are
hundreds. When I started, radio had only just begun; today, you only need go
to a music shop and buy the record for yourself. It's a century of change.'
Sacher's pioneering work in early music - he founded his own original
instrument ensemble, Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, in 1934 - is almost
forgotten today. His wealth has also tended to overshadow, and even
obstruct, his career as a conductor. But no-one has ever doubted the quality
of his musical judgment. The number of his commissions which have stood the
test of time speaks for itself. And he is still commissioning - the latest
being a violin concerto by Wolfgang Rihm, to be premiered next year by
Anne-Sophie Mutter.
It was Sacher's influence which turned Mutter's attention to contemporary
music. 'I told her 10 years ago - 'listen darling, you can't go on playing
the Romantic classics for ever, it's boring. You're a young woman of our
time'. We started with Stravinsky. She understands every style, she's a
sweetheart and a fantastic fiddler.'
He is convinced that understanding contemporary music is only a question of
generation, and that today's modern music will be popular tomorrow. 'Boulez
is now at Salzburg. He conducts Boulez, and the hall is as full as it was
with Karajan. We have modern composers who are first class people - Carter,
Lutoslawski, Berio. I don't see any crisis. Music will go on developing - as
it always has.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Motoring: Needing to make a name for itself - Mazda's sleek
Xedos enters a market in which status is vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mazda's bid to get into the lower end of the premium executive car market is
called the Xedos (pronounced ke-see-dos). Choosing this name must be a
Japanese revenge for all the mickey-taking by foreigners over the funny
names the Japanese have given their vehicles in the past, such as Cedric,
Violet, Gloria, Cherry, Bongo (yes, I swear it) and Genteel.
Even when they have thought up a good name, things have sometimes gone
wrong. Wouldn't The Toyota Windom be much better as the Wyndham? But what's
in a name? The Xedos 6 1.6i, Mazda's junior sports saloon, (pictured), is
cast in a similar, if smaller, mould to the Lexus GS300, a BMW 530 rival
that impressed me deeply.
At Pounds 15,995 for the manual (Pounds 16,895 automatic) the Xedos 6 1.6i
slips into the lower reaches of the executive market where it costs exactly
the same as a BMW 316i Special Equipment, which might or might not be sheer
coincidence.
It is sleek and shapely, with not a straight line or flat surface in sight.
From the front, the tiny air intake grille and slit-eyed headlamps make it
look like a sleepy Siamese cat with its tongue half out.
In common with the Lexus, the Xedos has been designed to cut through the air
with minimum disturbance and, at business motoring speeds, wind noise is
virtually suppressed at source. Perhaps this made me aware of the tyre roar
on coarsely textured surfaces. But, apart from this and an occasional
buzziness at high revolutions in the gears from the smooth-running and
vigorous 16-valve engine, I rated the Xedos 6 1.6i a compact and comely car
with delightful manners.
Just as Lexus GS300 buyers or user-choosers may well graduate to an LS400 as
they move higher up the management ladder, the 1.6i Xedos 6 will be a
stepping stone. Next in line is the two-litre, V6-engined Xedos 6 which
leads up to the flagship of the marque, the Xedos 9, with a choice of
two-litre or 2.5-litre V6 engines. The Xedos 9 made its debut at the
Frankfurt show last September and arrives in Britain early next year.
The biggest hurdle Lexus and Xedos have to leap is entirely subjective. When
executives choose new company cars, status might well rate higher than
performance. For years, the business and social credibility of makes such as
BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar has been well established.
Although Lexus LS400 sales increased during the recession while those of
most of its competitors fell, the name - unlike those of its European rivals
 -still does not have instant recognition. Xedos is even less familiar.
But then, so once were names like Canon, Minolta and Nikon. Just ask a
photographer what happened to Leica and Contax in the precision camera
market.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Golf: Secret joy of Ireland's missing links - Derek
Lawrenson follows Nick Faldo to Ballyliffin in County Donegal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So what else does Nick Faldo do with his spare time apart from strap his
wrist to the latest high-tech gadgetry to ease tendonitis?
This summer he donned his architect's hat and broadened his education by
visiting some of the great Irish golf courses that never host a pit-stop on
the European tour. His ambition is to design both a links and an inland
course in Britain that stand comparison with any, so the journey was an
essential one.
Some Irish links courses, such as County Sligo and Lahinch, are known to
most golf students, but there was one place that Faldo visited that has
escaped attention.
Ballyliffin, in Donegal, is the most northerly course in the whole of
Ireland. It lies just below Malin Head.
Quite why it is not recognised among Ireland's finest courses is something
of a mystery. Its absence from most guidebooks explains why the fairways are
largely deserted; a stark comparison to Ireland's most celebrated venues.
But Malin Head did have 19 days in July when the wind's was gale force, and
this was perhaps a contributing factor. Who, though, ever went to Ireland
for the weather?
Furthermore, Ballyliffin is a breathtaking links course, and the green fees,
at IPounds 8, represent a bargain which you will have to search hard and
long to match.
What Ballyliffin is not, however, is a fair golf course. It is gloriously,
maddeningly, unfair, as most links courses are. Its fairways are covered in
pimples, and if you were not surrounded by some of the most sublime views to
be found anywhere, you would be cursing as your 230 yard drive comes to rest
on a vicious up-slope.
The whole course is a hidden trove. It does not matter one score card you
have picked up lists the fifth hole as a 389 yard par four, when what you
are actually confronted by is one of the great natural par threes?
You quickly grow used to the fact that the score card measurements are in
yards while the marker posts on each hole are 150 metres from the flag.
Of course if you do not accept these eccentricities, there are plenty of
Pounds 75 per round courses in the UK where you will have time during the
five hours it takes to play 18 holes to ruminate on the fact that everything
is spot on.
Ballyliffin itself contains, so far as I could see, two hotels, two shops, a
post office, a couple of bed and breakfasts, two pitch and putts, a wondrous
beach and the golf course. It lies halfway up the Inishowen peninsula,
beloved of geologists, archaeologists, historians, naturalists,
ornithologists but not yet golfers. Just do not tell too many about it, will
you?
Faldo, by the way, played off the back tees and breezed round in 69, which
is three under par. He thanked club officials and left with a look of envy
on his face that suggested his minders were about to be confronted with the
questions: who is going to find me a piece of land that matches this one?
The day I played the sun was shining. There was barely a breath of wind. I
felt almost guilty standing on some of Ballyliffin's more exposed areas
swinging the club freely and with no concern for the weather. There must be
days out there when the wind possesses such strength that simply to address
the ball would be beyond the efforts of most of us. I would not want to swap
for one of those.
Not that everyone was happy on this gorgeous day. On the first tee in front
of us, there were two disgruntled Irishman. 'I don't know how they get away
with it,' one of them said, to which his friend replied to anyone in
earshot: 'Bloody disgusting charging Pounds 8 for green fees, isn't it?'
Clearly some people do not know a bargain even when it is laid out in front
of them in all its wonder.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Minister for a Day: From minor to major - Nigel Spivey picks
up the sports portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENS SANA in corpore sano (a sound mind in a sound body) was a maxim
fashioned by a satirist, not a doctor. And if you go back to its original
Latin context (Juvenal Satires 10) you find that it was framed not as a
conditional prescription, but rather as a wistful fritter of stoic
simplicity.
Numerous examples can be cited of sportsmen and women whose ungracious
boorishness appears to disprove the formula as it is commonly understood.
But not to worry. In my Ministry of Sport, the promotion of healthy minds in
sound bodies will radically transform the tenor of life in Britain.
In the past, this portfolio has been perceived as a minor sinecure. Some
thoroughly wretched physical specimens have slouched in and out of the post,
trailing clouds of ignominy behind them.
Searching their polysaturated hearts over the birching of English hooligans
or the steroid intake of Welsh weightlifters, they have treated sport as an
activity marginal to commerce, education and social welfare. They have
failed to grasp the fact that in a technological society there are always
going to be large numbers of unemployed, and those in employment will be
ever more sedentarily occupied. In such a society, sport is not marginal. It
is at the heart of human happiness.
So I shall be clearing the desks of my predecessors, and greatly extending
the powers of the Minister for Sport. John Patten, the education secretary,
will be first to feel my presence, for I have visited enough primary schools
to realise that we are nurturing a whole generation of asthmatic, myopic and
ill-co-ordinated children in this country, and my first move will be to get
these youngsters fit.
School teachers, who in the past used to be able (and willing) to stay on
for games coaching after lessons, will have their salaries immediately
doubled. School playing fields will be vastly extended, by compulsory
purchase where necessary, and school premises, especially in the cities,
endowed with new gymnasia.
We shall raise funds in the short term by imposing a 40 per cent tariff on
all computer games and videos (short-term, because I foresee a time not
distant when children are weaned off these debilitators. In the long term,
naturally, massive savings will be garnered from the fall-off in calls on
the National Health Service.
At the secondary school level a very similar programme will be in place.
Those marvellous men and women who used to forfeit their Saturday afternoons
to blow whistles on wet fields will be brought back and rewarded, and most
teenagers will return home with only just enough energy remaining to pick up
a book and sit quietly improving their literacy. The regime will not be
Spartan, but neither will it be very different from Arnold's Rugby.
I know that I shall have allies for my programme in both houses. Sebastian
Coe, MP for Falmouth and Camborne, will help; as will those athletic lords
Archer and Parkinson. In the first instance my ministerial aides will be
entirely recruited from the Cheltenham Ladies lacrosse team, anunfailing
advertisement for good sense and good health.
In due time I trust that state schools will be turning out equally glorious
products. I shall also employ a large detachment of peripatetic deputies,
whose job will be to tour the country, encouraging all the many local
initiatives which already exist. They will be role models of both prowess
and pleasant manners: not the Gattings or Mansells, but the Brearleys and
Linekers.
No other nation in the world, I think, has such a reservoir of amateur
enthusiasm for sport as Britain: my ministry will at last recognise this as
the resource it is, assisting with club expenses, providing bursaries for
those with special needs, and facilitating the escape routes sport offers to
those whose futures are otherwise bleak. Some of our greatest sportsmen
(Daley Thompson, Linford Christie, Frank Bruno, Geoff Capes) have openly
admitted that they might now be doing time were it not for sporting
opportunities. Ten years ago the government forced schools to sell their
playing fields. Now it is urgently having to build new prisons. The price is
being paid.
Youth is like quicksilver. It needs to move, to collide and bounce.
Injecting that elemental dynamism into the challenges of sport makes sense.
I am not concerned about the fortunes of the national soccer teams, nor
Britons who biff their way into the second round of the Wimbledon tennis
championships.
Professional athletes will always find their pitch according to the
marketplace. But I am concerned about the youngsters reduced to raving,
drinking, and fighting in the streets. There are happier ways of releasing
that energy.

FT  27 NOV 93 / The city now standing still: Traffic jams are becoming a
year-round nightmare for Bangkok's 8m inhabitants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is Monday, 6.30 pm, on the streets of Bangkok. A European businessman in
a pinstripe suit with rolled-up trousers wades through 18in of rain and raw
sewage, briefcase in one hand, shoes in the other, heading for home.
In another flooded road nearby, a pair of Thai schoolgirls are trapped with
the family chauffeur in their BMW. The engine is still running in spite of
the water, but the traffic ahead is stationary. They left school 3 1/2 hours
ago and are only halfway home.
A secretary who left work at 5 pm is standing in a crowded, motionless bus.
She will not reach her home in the suburbs until 11 pm.
An Englishman is forced to abandon a business trip to southern Thailand
after missing his flight; it took him more than three hours to reach the
airport. His pregnant wife has just spent six hours in a taxi trying, and
failing, to keep an appointment. Back in their apartment, she vents her
frustration by methodically ripping to shreds a novel set in Thailand
entitled A Haunting Smile.
This is, to be sure, a particularly bad Monday during the rainy season. But
traffic jams, once a source of wry local humour, are becoming a year-round
nightmare for the city's 8m inhabitants. Some Thais predict the government
will fall because of its failure to reduce congestion in the capital.
The effect on society and on family life is profound. Cars have become
second homes; middle-class Thais sleep, read books, watch television, make
telephone calls and do their homework in the Volvo. Mothers rise before
dawn, drag their children out of bed and into the car to beat the rush hour,
and feed them breakfast at the school gates. Dinner with friends has become
an unwelcome chore.
Even the normally aloof royal family has intervened in response to public
frustration. King Bhumipol has donated 13m baht (Dollars 500,000) to the
traffic police, allowing them to buy more motorcycles and train a 'rapid
deployment force' to rush to congested intersections.
'Traffic is getting worse and worse and everybody is moody, be it Thais or
foreigners,' said Queen Sirikit in her birthday speech at the palace in
August. 'The crisis has reached an unbearable point . . . It's sad to see
children leaving home at four o'clock in the morning.'
There is, unfortunately, no relief in sight. Successive governments, corrupt
or inept and sometimes both, have failed to plan the development of Bangkok
or provide any form of urban public transport other than buses and taxis.
Property developers building high-rise blocks - which will generate yet more
traffic - can flout such regulations as there are with a well-placed bribe.
Only 9 per cent of the city's surface area is given over to roads, compared
with a typical 25 per cent in the world's other major cities. As Thais
become more and more prosperous, an extra 450 new cars jostle on to the
streets each day. Thailand is now a bigger market for cars than Australia,
and on its way to becoming Toyota's biggest foreign market outside the US.
Thai commuters have quickly developed survival tactics to deal with the
ordeal of spending six hours a day in their cars. One of the most popular
radio stations in Bangkok is 'Jor Sor Roi,' or Radio 100. Drivers with
mobile telephones give details of the latest snarl-ups over the air to their
fellow victims. The radio station once co-ordinated the helicopter rescue of
a woman about to give birth who was trapped in a traffic jam.
Physical needs are catered for by the Comfort 100, a Dollars 5 portable
toilet available from Esso garages which looks like a plastic petrol
container with a funnel; or the Easi Pee, a sort of plastic bag containing
liquid-absorbing gel; or, for something more than mere urination, the
all-purpose Combi, a bag in a cardboard box.
For those in a hurry, gangs of motor cycle taxi-drivers wearing coloured
overshirts (for which they have to pay protection money to the police) are
clustered at various street corners around the city. They can be seen
weaving skilfully with their passengers in and out of the immobile lines of
cars.
Then there are the mobile offices. Dr Narongchai Akrasanee, head of the
General Finance group of companies, uses a modified Volkswagen Transporter,
a van fitted with swivelling chairs, a telephone, a facsimile machine, a
television, video and compact disc players and a refrigerator. Visitors can
hire a similar but slightly less luxurious van from the Regent Hotel for
Bt5,000 a day.
'It's mad,' Narongchai says of the traffic. 'It's the major suffering of the
people here, and it's making the government very unpopular . . . If we don't
have public transportation soon, it will be crazy.' He and his researchers
estimate that congestion costs the city's inhabitants nearly Dollars 2bn a
year in lost time and fuel. Other estimates run as high as Dollars 6bn.
Desperate citizens, encouraged by newspapers, have proposed dozens of
improbable schemes to alleviate their plight, including declaring a state of
emergency: 'Give a supremo draconian powers,' said one Bangkok Post
headline.
After years of contemplating and then failing to deliver everything from
elevated Skytrains and Skybuses to underground trains, government officials
are thinking of moving the capital - or at least their ministries - to a new
site further east. One of them even suggested building twin motorways in the
Chao Phraya river, which runs through the city centre and remains one of
Bangkok's few relatively pleasant spots.
Another idea, supported strongly by the police, is to reverse the direction
of major one-way streets, although no one is sure why this would make any
difference. A further proposal is to ban cars on alternate days on the basis
of their licence plate digits; those starting with an odd number would be
allowed out on, say, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and those with even
numbers on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. But they tried that in the
Nigerian capital, Lagos, and all the rich families bought extra cars so they
could drive every day of the week.
Even if a solution - an underground railway, for instance - is agreed, it
would take years to build and the construction work would cause further
chaos. In the meantime, Bangkok will continue to suffer. Its people are
poisoned daily by the carbon monoxide, lead and toluene spewing from
thousands of exhaust pipes. A fifth of the traffic policemen have hearing
problems, and many have lung disorders as well.
The manic behaviour of Bangkok bus drivers has been explained partly by a
study conducted by a local university into the effects of exhaust fumes.
According to Professor Thephanom Muangman, dean of the environment and
resources faculty at Mahidol University: 'The gases are powerful enough to
devastate the central nervous system, brain functions and consciousness,'
One can only guess at the psychological impact of the traffic on Bangkok's
school pupils. 'Our children's future is being badly affected,' said a
letter to the Post from a 'concerned parent' who pleaded with the
authorities to do something to return the country to harmony and sanity.
'Hurry up,' the writer said, 'before we all go mad.'
The crisis has already had an impact on the capital's culture. A Thai author
won a prize this year for a novella called A Family on the Road; the family
lives entirely in its car and the book ends with the wife becoming pregnant.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Rush is on for the BES - The latest
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many sponsors and companies involved in business expansion schemes are
urging people to invest before Tuesday's Budget because of speculation that
chancellor Kenneth Clarke might decide to axe the BES immediately instead of
December 31, as announced previously. But while it is in their interests to
urge swift action, investors should make sure they get financial advice
before acting; otherwise, they could find themselves regretting any hasty
action.
Budget fever has led some sponsors to increase their exit prices. The
Allenbridge group, a leading BES analyst, says this should help keep up the
price of new issues.
Accumulus Froebel, a cash-backed, arranged exit scheme sponsored by Terrace
Hill Capital, has raised its exit price from 120p to 124p after five years
for every 100p invested. Terrace Hill says the return to a higher-rate
taxpayer will increase from 14.1 per cent to 14.8 per cent a year as a
result. The issue is almost fully subscribed. Neill Clerk, sponsor to St
Anne's Residences, has also raised its exit price from 120p to 122p.
However, sponsor Hodgson Martin which has launched St Andrews' Residences
for the Scottish university, has dropped its exit price by 1p to 122p. The
net return should be 14.3 per cent a year to a higher-rate taxpayer. Minimum
investment is Pounds 2,000.
Downing Corporate Finance, which saw its Chiltern housing programme
over-subscribed, has now launched a second issue. It aims to raise up to
Pounds 5m for the housing association to provide homes at affordable rent to
low income families. The exit price of 124p equates to 14 per cent for a
higher-rate taxpayer (the calculation of BES rates of return depend on a
number of factors, such as when tax relief can be claimed). The scheme,
fully cash-backed with a minimum investment of Pounds 2,000, is described by
the British Taxpayers' Association, a tax consultant, as 'a top of the
market, cash-backed, contracted exit for a worthy cause.'
The Tenth Johnson Fry Cash-Backed scheme aims to raise Pounds 5m for
Nottingham Trent University. The contracted exit price is 121p, equating to
13.7 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. The buy-back obligation is being
secured by a certificate of deposit. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000.
Meanwhile, the Pounds 30m BES launched early this month by Nationwide
building society and Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, has become fully
subscribed. But another Pounds 30m is being raised to buy properties
repossessed by Nationwide to be let on assured tenancies. The terms of the
scheme are almost identical to the previous issue. Investors can choose a
fixed return of 121p after five years for every 100p invested, equating to a
compound annual return of 14.3 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer.
Alternatively, they can have a 60p minimum return plus 1.2p for every 1 per
cent rise in the FT-SE 100. The return will be calculated from the level on
the start date to the highest closing level during the five years, thereby
locking-in the highest point. The index would have to rise by 51 per cent in
order to beat the fixed return. Both returns are backed by certificates of
deposit. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
Terrace Hill Capital and Neill Clerk are sponsors to South Eastern Recovery
IV, a 'predator' BES which does not have a secured exit route but aims to
profit from the still-depressed residential property market by buying now,
letting to private tenants for five years, and then selling in the hope of a
handsome profit. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
Pavilions of Splendour is an estate agency specialising in unusual
buildings. Its managing director, Marianne Watson-Smyth, is a former
secretary of Save Britain's Heritage. It aims to raise Pounds 250,000
through the BES to market and sell Grade I or Grade II properties. Minimum
investment is Pounds 1,000.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT pool for shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I understand that when shares are added to an existing holding, the base
cost of the total holding (old and new) has to be used in any capital gains
work - and there is not a 'last in, first out' arrangement for subsequent
sales. If, however, one holding is personal and the additional one is in a
nominee name, how are the above rules applied?
Shares in your own name, and those in the name of a nominee, are pooled for
CGT purposes without regard to the difference in registration. This follows
from sections 60(1) and 107(1&amp;2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992:
60(1) 'In relation to assets held by a person as nominee for another person
. . . this Act shall apply as if the property were vested in . . . the
person . . . for whom he is the nominee . . .'
107(1) 'Where a person disposes of securities, the securities disposed-of
shall be identified in accordance with the provisions of this section with
securities of the same class acquired by him which could be comprised in
that disposal.'
(2) 'This section applies notwithstanding that securities disposed of are
otherwise identified by the disposal or by a transfer or delivery giving
effect to it . . .'

for quoted shares).

FT  27 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transferring a holding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I intend to transfer to my son part of my holding of SPLIT (Save &amp; Prosper
Linked IT) capital shares, the price of which is substantially above that at
which I bought them. To save market-makers' spread (substantial in this
case) and broker's commission, I wish to execute a direct transfer form
which my son can then register directly with S&amp;P. Am I correct in assuming
that:
1. My son will have to send the completed form and pay  1/2 per cent of the
market value to the Stamp Duty Office before he can register the transfer
with S&amp;P.
2. This market value will be based on stock exchange closing price (as
stated in the FT Cityline) on the day of the transfer.
3. A simple written letter from me to my son, signed by us both, will be
sufficient evidence of this transaction andacceptable to the Inland Revenue
for CGT purposes.
Alternatively, I might wish to transfer these shares to my son as a gift,
for no consideration. In this case, would the transfer be exempt from stamp
duty?
Also, would I have the choice of either effecting the transfer at present
market price, accepting the CGT liability myself, or postponing liability
(as in the case of transfer between husband and wife) until my son disposes
of the shares?
If you sell the shares to your son, the stamp duty will be based upon
whatever price he actually pays you - as shown on the transfer form. If you
give them to him, no stamp duty will be payable (provided that you complete
the stamp duty exemption certificates on the back of the transfer form).
For CGT purposes, it makes no difference whether you sell the shares to your
son or give them to him: you and he will be treated as though you had sold
them to him at their market value (on the quarter-up basis) on the day of
the sale contract or gift, as the case might be. Ask your tax office for the
free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction).
The CGT rules for transfers between husband and wife do not apply to any
other transactions.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: How a lender plumbed the depths -
Alison Smith reads the banking ombudsman's latest report and finds some
sobering stories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A self-employed plumber, whose bank sold him a loan protection policy
without telling him there were restrictions on unemployment cover for people
in his category, won almost Pounds 700 in compensation after his case was
taken up by the banking ombudsman.
In another case, a grandmother opened savings accounts for two boys but they
did not get the preferential interest rate advertised. Each account received
an extra Pounds 852 in interest after the ombudsman intervened.
Publication this week of the annual report from Laurence Shurman, the
industry's consumer watchdog, has highlighted the continuing level of
complaints against banks, although the increase was not nearly as steep as
last year.
Shurman stressed higher standards of conduct were still needed from both
banks and customers. He said banks should show more sensitivity, even when
they were entirely in the right, and debt counselling should be available
more widely.
Shurman urged that those entering the industry should receive specific
lessons in banking ethics as part of the training offered by the Chartered
Institute of Banking. He also recommended that the revision of the code of
banking practice should reflect a European directive on unfair terms in
consumer contracts which is due to come into effect in 1995.
The report showed that preliminary complaints rose to 10,231 in the year to
the end of September 1993 - a very slight increase on the previous year. But
complaints accepted for full investigation rose more sharply - by 16 per
cent - to 1,111.
Consumer and customer groups were disappointed that complaints had not
fallen despite the introduction of improvements such as the banking practice
code. Just under 40 banks are covered by this scheme, under which personal
customers and small companies can complain about maladministration involving
sums with a maximum of Pounds 100,000.
In just over one-third of the cases investigated fully during 1992-93, the
ombudsman found for the customer. Most awards were between Pounds 100 and
Pounds 10,000, but there were some striking extremes.
The highest, of Pounds 81,700, went to a case involving a property
development project where a small company had its overdraft facility
withdrawn after it had committed itself. The lowest, of Pounds 5, came after
a claim for Pounds 9,000 was investigated: the ombudsman decided the
complainant was entitled to 44p, which was rounded up to take account of
interest.
One area where complaints are growing concerns how banks deal with
mortgages. Shurman said customers should get clearer information about the
exact scope of mortgage protection policies since banks 'are not always as
keen as they should be to explain the limitations attaching to such
policies'.
He said a typical problem arose where two people were borrowing jointly
against their combined salaries but the second-named borrower did not
qualify for the unemployment cover, which applied only to the first
borrower.
The report showed, however, that there had been improvements in some areas.
There were fewer complaints about cash machines, and from existing customers
claiming they had not been told about new savings accounts which offered
better rates of interest.
Even so, Shurman made clear that faster progress needed to be made in trying
to reduce card fraud through measures such as fitting cash machines with
videos and monitoring suspicious patterns of withdrawals. He said also that
banks should do more to protect those who were most vulnerable to card
fraud, including the very elderly.
While welcoming the fact that complaints had levelled off, Shurman
criticised some banks for not publicising the ombudsman scheme enough and
for having complaints procedures which were so complex that they put people
off.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Clarke must take axe to bureaucracy
 -Kevin Goldstein-Jackson makes his suggestions for the Budget / Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The credit card receipt said 'Murder One' followed by a rather large amount.
I was preparing for Kenneth Clarke's first Budget on Tuesday.
In history, many national declines can be traced to increases in bureaucracy
rather than a growth in occupations actually creating something. It is
partly to pay for vast armies of civil servants that Clarke, the chancellor
of the exchequer, will be forced in his Budget to find additional ways of
raising revenue.
My 'Murder One' payment was not for a hit man to help reduce the ranks of
Whitehall mandarins but to Murder One bookshop in London's Charing Cross
Road for a large number of thrillers. I was stocking up in case Clarke
imposes value added tax on books. I have also renewed several magazine
subscriptions for two years rather than the usual one in order to escape any
VAT that might be imposed on such publications.
My share portfolio is much reduced from last year and I am not adding to it
until after the Budget; I want to keep cash available for any new investment
opportunities which may arise because of Clarke's proposals. I am certainly
not rushing into any last-minute investments based purely on 'tax avoidance'
promotions: to me, an investment must appear to have reasonable prospects
quite apart from tax considerations.
In his previous ministerial positions, Clarke has not been afraid to
announce radical changes, so I feel he will put his own considerable mark on
the Budget. There could be surprises for everyone.
Not all may be pleasant. For one thing, he is known to view the various
anomalies in VAT with some concern. Suppose he reduced it from 17.5 per cent
to, say, 16 per cent - but put it on everything.
Discussing VAT on fuel, Clarke has said: 'Most other countries do it.'
Since, unlike Britain, many countries in the European Union do not zero-rate
bus fares, food and children's clothing, the same argument could be advanced
for imposing VAT on these items in the UK - especially as EC bureaucrats are
keen to 'harmonise' VAT rates.
Many people travel to the Continent to bring back alcoholic drinks, so
depriving the chancellor of UK duties on beers, wines and spirits. VAT on
ferry trips might make such expeditions less attractive.
The chancellor has also said that extending VAT to fuel 'will encourage real
energy conservation and contribute to our targets for reducing carbon
dioxide emissions'. Somewhat similar arguments could be advanced for taxing
bus, aeroplane and ferry travel while zero-rating the railways. This might
also make it slightly easier to privatise British Rail.
The chancellor could also announce an end to mortgage interest tax relief,
and major alterations to National Insurance contributions.
Such dramatic changes would affect almost every sector of the stock market.
But what, as a private investor, do I hope the chancellor will do?
We know he wants to encourage industry. Although business expansion schemes
are due to end on December 31, I hope a replacement, with tax advantages,
will be announced to encourage investment in new and expanding companies
that are genuinely involved in manufacturing. But sharp lawyers and
accountants should not be allowed to hijack investments into property or
other non-manufacturing activities.
I would also like to see personal equity plans (Peps) abolished in favour of
a new scheme to encourage direct investment in companies without the need
(and expense) of investing through plan managers.
Everyone should be allowed to invest a certain amount each year (say, Pounds
10,000) directly in shares without having to pay tax on any gains from
these, or on money made from re-investing the proceeds.
In addition, people should be encouraged to devise their own pension plans.
Any money (up to a certain specified level) invested directly in shares for
pension purposes would receive the same tax advantages now given to pension
and insurance fund managers.
Abolishing stamp duty on share transactions is also long overdue. Again, to
encourage a more direct involvement with companies and to deter tax
avoidance, stamp duty could be ended on shares bought and registered in the
names of individual private investors, although others would still have to
pay. This would help to level the playing field between private investors
and institutions, which benefit already from lower dealing costs.
Whatever the chancellor's tax-raising plans, I hope they will be accompanied
by massive cuts in the size of the civil service - starting with top
officials in Whitehall. Britain is dividing rapidly into two sectors: the
haves (almost unsackable civil servants with guaranteed, inflation-proof
pensions) and the have-nots (almost everyone else whose job security and
pension benefits remain in doubt).
I would also like to see a crackdown on the use of nominee names and other
methods of disguising the identities of certain UK-based businessmen who
make fortunes from share and other transactions but pay little or no tax. If
ordinary people are being asked to contribute more, they have a right to
expect that everyone shares the tax burden fairly.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: New look for tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Readers of the Weekend FT will notice that the format and content of many
statistical tables have been changed substantially. The changes were
introduced first in Tuesday's edition.
The aim has been to bring the tables up to date, in tune with the needs of
readers. The most obvious difference is that the tables have been given a
consistent type face.
Equities. The London share service pages, which have been revamped in recent
years, are largely unaffected by the changes. UK investors will note,
however, that we have pulled together a number of statistics under the
heading 'Key indicators' (see Inset for example; today's table appears on
page 15 in the first section).
From Tuesday to Friday, the best-performing sectors appear as in the Inset;
on Saturdays, a full list of Leaders and Laggards appears elsewhere on the
page. The Saturday paper also includes the FT-SE 100's closing level on each
weekday.
Substantial changes have also been made to our coverage of international
equities (see page 20 of the first section). There is now scope for all
shares to show highs, lows, dividend yields and price-earnings ratios.
Although we are not yet able to show these figures for all the stocks, we
hope to fill in the gaps over the next few months. We have also expanded our
range of world stock market indices, including more from emerging markets.
Equity options and futures now appear on the World Stock Markets page.
Bonds. Coverage of international bonds is now concentrated on one page. On
Saturdays, this page is headed Bonds and Commodities; from Tuesday to
Friday, it is called International Capital Markets.
Our gilts coverage has, therefore, moved from its old position (just before
the London share service pages) to that page, which can be found today on
page 12 of the first section.
The only alteration to the format of the information provided is that
details of the income and redemption yield are now shown on the left hand
side, rather than on the right as before.
Currencies. Because of the space created by moving some of the futures
information to other pages, it has been possible to expand our coverage of
currencies substantially. The two separate articles, on currencies and money
markets, have been combined in a single report.
The currency tables have been expanded to include a greater range of
countries. The mid-rate is now shown explicitly, rather than being left for
the reader to calculate.
The table of cross-rates has also been expanded. All these statistics appear
on page 13 in today's first section.
Derivatives. The general rule is that tables which focus on derivatives will
appear on the same page as statistics on the underlying markets. Thus,
equity index futures and options will now be found on the World and London
stock markets pages.
All futures and options contracts will be shown in the same format and will
be grouped together by product, rather than by the exchange on which they
are traded.
It is always disconcerting to find that statistics which are used regularly
by readers have changed, or have been moved to a different position in the
paper. But we believe the new structure is a considerable improvement and
that readers will find the statistics even more useful than before.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: A guide for wide-eyed graduates - So
you've left university and started work. Bethan Hutton explains how to
negotiate the financial labyrinth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So you're a 1993 graduate, starting your first job this autumn. You might
have been impressed initially by monthly pay cheques as big as the grant
cheque you got each term.
By now, however, you probably have realised that the more you earn, the
faster money tends to disappear. Food, rent, council tax, transport, clothes
for work and an active social life can leave very little in the bank at the
end of the month. So, this could be a good time to sit down, examine your
financial situation closely and work out your priorities.
The first task for many new graduates will be repaying the debts accumulated
during their studies. The average 1993 graduate left college owing almost
Pounds 1,800, according to a survey this year by Barclays bank. 'Interest
rates are low at the moment but, if someone is going to organise their
finances properly, debt repayment must be a priority,' says Mark Bolland, of
London fee-based financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe.
A growing proportion of student debt arises from official student loans. But
these have a very low interest rate and repayments do not start until the
April after graduation, so they are not such an immediate worry;,in any
case, graduates earning less than 85 per cent of average earnings (now
Pounds 1,165 gross a month) can delay repayment.
Bank overdrafts and loans, however, usually carry much higher interest rates
and should be paid off as soon as possible. Running an overdraft can also
lead to hefty bank charges, while credit card debts are an even more
expensive type of borrowing.
A number of banks offer graduate loan schemes, intended to cover the
expenses incurred in setting up home and starting work. Some also are
marketed as a way to consolidate student debts with regular repayments.
This idea should be treated with caution, though: borrowing more to pay off
existing debts is usually an easy way to end up in even deeper trouble. But
if you have large debts at high rates which you have no hope of clearing in
the short term, it could be worth looking at one of the special graduate
loans - providing the rate is lower and there is no arrangement fee.
This could also be the time to look at what your bank is offering in terms
of general service. The bank offering the most attractive deal to first-year
students is not necessarily the best once you are in work.
Most of the big high street banks offer graduate packages for six to 18
months after finishing university. These usually involve free banking and
preferential loan and overdraft rates and most are are open to all new
graduates, not just existing customers.
Once you have your debts and day-to-day finances under control, you can
start thinking about planning for the future. Are you keen to settle down
and buy your own flat, or are you waiting only for the results of your final
accountancy exams before taking off round the world for a few months?
In either case, regular saving is a good habit to acquire while you are
young and without dependants. But maintain a healthy scepticism towards
people who say they have the ideal savings vehicle for you.
Remain especially alert when confronted by members of the financial services
industry: once you are earning money, you are on their list of targets and
some can be over-enthusiastic about trying to sell you life assurance and
related savings policies. Some of these can turn out to be inflexible for
the saver while paying good commission to the seller.
Watch out in particular for casual acquaintances from school or college who
call out of the blue and are keen to meet. You could turn up expecting a
relaxed drink but find yourself on the receiving end of a hard sell for
insurance or investments.
David Harris, of independent advisers Chantrey Financial Services, says: 'I
do not believe that the majority of life assurance-related savings schemes
are appropriate. The inflexible nature and longer time-scale of such plans
makes them unsuitable.'
Instead, he recommends looking at a range of more flexible products. These
range from low-risk, tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) and
National Savings products such as the yearly plan and the investment
account, to equity investments using a tax-free personal equity plan (Pep).
You can save as little as Pounds 20 a month with all these schemes.
'Flexibility must be an important consideration for very young people,'
saysBolland. He recommends investment trust savings schemes as a sensible
way of building up some capital.
Investment trusts are companies which buy shares; investors purchase shares
in the trust as a way of gaining exposure to a spread of equities. Savings
schemes allow you to buy small quantities of shares on a regular basis, with
as little as Pounds 20 a month. Bolland also mentions National Savings, and
the save-as-you-earn share option schemes offered by some employers, as
worth considering.
As for housing, Bolland says: 'Right now is probably a good time for young
people to buy their own flats. It all depends on earnings but, in many
areas, servicing a mortgage is cheaper than renting. I would suggest that
this is a more practical use of money for someone at this stage of their
life than engaging in long-term savings.'
Accumulating some savings before taking on a mortgage is a good idea,
however. Not only will this help with legal costs and so on but, if you can
put down a deposit of around 25 per cent of the value of the property, you
could avoid paying expensive mortgage indemnity premiums - and reduce the
hazard of getting caught in a negative equity trap if property prices fall.
Retirement seems a long way off when you have just started work but people
will tell you that, now you are working, you should think about a pension.
'The financial services industry would have everyone believe that the
younger you start saving for a pension, the better,' says Bolland. But he is
sceptical.
If your employer has an occupational pension scheme, Bolland says it will
probably be worth joining, depending on a number of factors - most
importantly, how long you expect to stay in the job.
Personal pensions, sold by life assurance companies, are less likely to be
worthwhile at this early stage in your career because early payments are
eaten up by commissions and charges and your personal and work circumstances
are likely to change.
'If the person really is in a position to put some money away for
retirement, then single premiums where possible should be paid,' Bolland
says. 'The point is that it is daft to expect that a personal pension which
might be suitable at age-22 will remain so for the rest of the person's
life. There must be limited appeal in a 22 year-old tying up capital for 40
years or more.'
Harris agrees. 'At this age, it is difficult to see how single individuals
would have a need for life assurance or sophisticated pension arrangements.
'It would be far more beneficial to think of channelling available resources
into savings, which are flexible and may be used at a future date in
purchasing property.'
Bolland's advice is unequivocal: 'I think the main point that people should
bear in mind is that there are going to be a lot of people trying to sell
them things, and that great care is needed to avoid making investments on
spurious grounds. Keeping one's options open at all times is sensible.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Rate changes await Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday's base rate cut from 6 to 5.5 per cent triggered a number of
mortgage and savings rate changes but most banks and building societies are
awaiting the Budget before moving, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Savers are
getting nominally low rates for money left on deposit at banks and societies
 -many instant access savings accounts at societies pay about 4.5 per cent
gross on deposits of Pounds 5,000.
If societies do not want to squeeze savers much further, they have two
choices: to reduce mortgage rates by less than the full half point; or to
squeeze their own margins in a bid to satisfy both savers and householders.
Banks have greater flexibility, since they can fund their mortgages through
the money markets instead of relying on retail funds. They are competing
aggressively for an increased share of the mortgage market.
The Nationwide and National &amp; Provincial societies, and the National
Westminster bank, all have cut their standard variable rate by a quarter of
a percentage point to 7.74 per cent. Existing borrowers at N&amp;P will have to
wait until after the Budget before being told when the new rate applies,
while those at Nationwide and NatWest will get the reduction from January 1.
Nationwide also has launched several new one-year mortgage discounts. The
size depends on the amount of deposit borrowers have available.
Discounts of between 0.5 and 2 percentage points are available for
Nationwide homeowners moving house, and for new borrowers. The obligation
for borrowers with a deposit of less than 10 per cent to take out mortgage
payment cover is being waived (except for some fixed and capped rates). The
society also has waived its mortgage application fee, which covers the
valuation for those borrowing up to 95 per cent. Nationwide will pay such
borrowers Pounds 250 on completion of the mortgage.
Others to have cut their mortgage rate include the Newcastle building
society, which has reduced by 0.24 of a point to 7.75 per cent, and Northern
Rock, down by 0.34 to 7.65 per cent.
Royal Bank of Scotland has passed on the full 0.5 point reduction, taking
its rate down to 7.49 per cent, while two centralised lenders, Bank of
Ireland and Citibank, are reducing their rates to 7.6 per cent. Existing
customers will benefit from December 1 at Bank of Ireland, and from January
1 at Citibank.
Centralised lenders are, theoretically, in a good position to lower their
rates since, like the banks, they can get funding from the money markets.
'They have the opportunity to be competitive; but since most new business is
being done on fixed and discounted mortgages, they may decide to use their
additional margins there,' says Ian Darby, of mortgage broker John Charcol.
John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS, is surprised that the
societies are cutting their mortgage rates by as much as they have because
of the pressure on savings rates. He says: 'Societies have to offer
relatively high savings rates because of pressure for retail funds from the
stock market and the government. If they cut mortgage rates by an average of
0.25 of a point, I think savers' rates will come down by about 0.3 of a
point.'
The large societies are not revealing their hand until chancellor Kenneth
Clarke reveals his in the Budget on Tuesday, but some banks have announced
reductions in savers' rates already. NatWest has pruned 0.625 of a
percentage point off most of its rates while Barclays has reduced by about
0.25 of a point.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets: The opium of the chattering classes - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Kenneth Clarke was pushed centre stage in The Tories, an everyday
story of Westminster folk, traders in the equity market have been
confidently expecting an interest rate cut. Playing the part of a
softhearted-but-plain-speaking Midlands' son of toil, the chancellor seemed
certain to boost the soap opera's flagging ratings with some well timed
relief for hard-pressed homeowners and grim-faced industrialists. Yet the
summer came and went, the party conference season passed. Equity-watchers
never lost faith that Clarke would eventually remember his lines.
On Tuesday the market finally got what it wanted, with a half-point cut in
base rates to 5 1/2 per cent, though the suspense had rather been spoiled by
the long wait. As a result the FT-SE 100 index actually fell by 1.3 points
on the day and only rose by 3.4 points through the week to finish at 3111.4.
The muted response perhaps reflected fears that the interest rate cut was
only part of the story. Would the sequel - 'Budget II - the next generation'
prove a real tear-jerker?
Opinions were divided. Astute TV addicts pointed out that in conventional
plots the happy ending follows the sad scene, and that the rate cut was
authorised because the inflation outlook was good. And since the fall was
only half a percentage point, the budget might well prove to be less savage
than feared. By the end of the week the market consensus was that perhaps
only Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn of extra taxes would be raised. That encouraged
hopes that the pattern of recent budgets, where equities rose in
anticipation of the speech and fell in response, might be reversed.
Elsewhere in the television jungle there was plenty of chatter. On Wednesday
Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, finally agreed to allow ITV companies
to own two franchises, intensifying the speculation about who was about to
buy what. The move is intended to improve the efficiency of ITV companies by
removing some duplicated costs.
Now, apart from forbidding the merger of the two London stations, it is open
season. Once the legislation is passed Granada is widely tipped to bid for
LWT, and Carlton might have a tilt at Central. Then again, Central is
rumoured to be eyeing Anglia which may also be on the receiving end of
Meridian's attentions. MAI, which owns a majority stake in Meridian, is also
supposed to be looking at buying HTV. The confused can perhaps take refuge
with Yorkshire Tyne Tees, which, since it already owns two franchises, is
about the only company which is probably safe. Dinner table conversation in
Hampstead, never knowingly understated, reached fever pitch as the
permutations proliferated.
Another group apparently intent on turning a drama into a crisis was Opec,
which met in Vienna this week. Despite the recent weakness in the price of
crude oil, the cartel did not agree to cut production and oil prices tumbled
to a five- year low of Dollars 14.50 a barrel on Friday. Adjusted for
inflation crude oil is now almost back to the low point reached in 1986, and
only marginally above the real price it traded at before the first oil shock
of 1973-74. JR Ewing and Dallas fell victim to the last bear market, so
would Opec follow this time?
Those of a depressive disposition were busily writing the cartel out of the
series: a weakened Opec laid low by increasingly efficient Western
production and the strains of reducing oil incomes. The less apocalyptic
script is that Opec was not prepared to be bullied into output cuts by the
market when the degree of overproduction was so small. A few more chilly
weeks in Western Europe might be all it needed to bring the market back into
balance and pull the crude price back above Dollars 16 a barrel.
Share prices of the large integrated oil companies held up on the assumption
that the crude price weakness was temporary. There was, however, some
selling yesterday by those US investors who returned to their phones after
Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. Over the week, Shell slipped 9p to 678p and
BP 8p to 333p.
Exploration companies, which do not have refining businesses to offset the
falling oil price, fared worse. Lasmo fell 16p to 117p, and Enterprise 19p
to 437p. The price of petrol has not thus far been a notable casualty.
Still, it was not all gloom in the energy business. Half year figures from
PowerGen and Scottish Power proved that privatisation is good for you.
Having cut staff costs immediately after it was floated PowerGen is now
running down its coal stocks and releasing cash. Scottish Power has taken
advantage of the cheaper coal deal negotiated by the English generators to
cut its own bill from British Coal.
The threat of referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission still hangs
over the English generating companies. That will probably curb the market's
enthusiasm over the next few weeks but, in spite of the share price rise
since flotation, many think the electricity companies still look attractive.
Undoubtedly the star of the week was Peter Wood, the founder of Direct Line
insurance, who has taken the motor insurance industry by storm since 1985.
Under his profit-linked pay package he received a bonus of Pounds 18m. He
also took a Pounds 24m payment to buy out his contract which had come to
embarrass both Wood and Royal Bank of Scotland, the owner of Direct Line.
Now the reluctant hero is to buy some Royal Bank shares, and fund managers
concluded that if they were good enough for him, they were good enough for
them too. The shares rose 14p to 384p. Wood is, apparently, a workaholic,
which brings to mind J P Getty's recipe for success: get up early, work
hard, and strike oil. These days it seems insurance, rather than oil, is the
place to be.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Nationwide's new bond - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide's new escalating three-year Fixed Growth Bond will pay 5.5 per
cent gross in the first six months, rising to 7.5 per cent gross in the last
six months. Those closing the account in years 2 and 3 will lose 180 days'
interest.
Britannia's Guaranteed Reversal bond pays a variable rate which changes by
half a percentage point with every half point chnage in bank base rates.
Base rates at 5.5 per cent attract interest at 6 per cent gross. The maximum
interest rate is 7.5 per cent gross (base rates at 4 per cent) and the
minimum is 5.5 per cent (base rates at 6.5 per cent).
The bond matures on October 1 1994.
The minimum investment in both building society bonds is Pounds 5,000.
Portman is paying a fixed rate of 6.5 per cent gross for six months (or 6
per cent for one year) on a minimum deposit of Pounds 500. It will withdraw
the bond on Tuesday.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Banking fears hit Japanese stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese stock prices dived 2.9 per cent yesterday, as fears gathered about
the health of the banking system and the onset of an economic recovery,
which is fading into the distance.
The Nikkei average fell below 17,000 to 16,726.37, ending the week down 6.8
per cent and reflecting renewed concern about the country's banks after they
disclosed sharply lower profits and higher non-performing loans.
Tokyo's index of banking stocks slipped 5.4 per cent yesterday, as attention
was drawn to the banks' attempts to cope with the consequences of their
reckless lending during the late 1980s and, now, with the effects of a
deepening recession.
Investors in Tokyo recall that weakness in bank prices last year heralded
the market's fall to a six-year low of 14,309.41.
Stock price falls are particularly damaging in Japan, where many companies,
financial and non-financial, rely on a large pile of unrealised equity gains
as a buffer against hard times.
Aware of that danger, the country's leading brokers this week held talks
with the Japan Renewal party, which dictates economic policy within the
seven-party coalition government. The brokers want the government to
stimulate the economy to prevent an asset price fall that could send the
economy into a downward spiral.
'Something has to be done about the banks' problems,' said Mr Yutaka Nakai,
a general manager at Daiwa Securities. Ministry of Finance officials have
insisted that public funds will not be used to help the banks. They hope an
easing of tax regulations will encourage write-offs.
Another reason for the stock price fall is technical. The newly introduced
Nikkei 300 index, likely to replace the Nikkei 225 as the market's benchmark
next year, is heavily weighted with banking stocks. Traders who recently
accumulated Nikkei 300 stocks were surprised by the banks' poor earnings and
sold their stakes.
Corporate capital spending figures announced yesterday reflected
deteriorating confidence in the economy. Large companies were expected to
cut capital spending by 3.5 per cent this year, according to a survey by
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Consumer spending is also falling. Large retailers reported that sales
slipped 3.6 per cent in October, against a year earlier, the 17th
consecutive month of decline.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Inland Revenue seeks order for the winding up of Nissan UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue has applied for a winding-up order against Nissan UK, the
former importer and distributor of Nissan cars which was at the centre of
Britain's biggest tax fraud.
The Revenue is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m from NUK, controlled
by Mr Octav Botnar, which it claims is the company's tax liability for a
period of 17 years in which NUK's profits were understated.
Earlier this year two former NUK directors were jailed for their part in the
tax fraud.
The High Court has appointed Mr Colin Bird and Mr Dipanka Ghosh of
accountants Price Waterhouse as provisional liquidators of NUK. The
appointment is only temporary, however, and the Revenue will seek on Monday
in the High Court to have the arrangement extended.
NUK is expected to challenge the appointment of the liquidators and the
winding-up petition. It has also appealed against the assessment of its tax
liabilities and maintains there are no valid grounds for the tax claim.
The company, which was deprived of the lucrative Nissan franchise by Nissan
Motor, the Japanese carmaker, at the end of 1991, reported net assets of
Pounds 96.6m at the end of July 1992 in its last set of audited accounts.
Under the terms of their appointment, the provisional liquidators hold a
neutral position with the task of locating and safeguarding the assets of
NUK for the benefit of all its creditors.
NUK is a subsidiary of Nissan UK Holdings, which is owned by European Motor
Vehicles Corporation. EMV is registered in Panama and was established as a
trust by Mr Botnar.
Following the loss of the Nissan franchise, NUK said that it would 'continue
as a property investment company'. Its sister company Automotive and
Financial Group (AFG), which is owned through a trust in the Bahamas also
established by Mr Botnar, is still one of the biggest multi-franchise UK
motor retailer groups.
Earlier this year Mr Michael Hunt, managing director of NUK, was jailed for
eight years for his part in the NUK tax fraud. He is currently appealing
against his conviction and sentence.
He was convicted for conspiring to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 55m in
corporation tax by helping artificially to inflate freight charges for
Nissan cars imported from Japan. When interest is added, the total loss to
the public purse from the fraud was estimated to be more than Pounds 87m.
His co-defendant, Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director with the
company, was sentenced to three years after admitting, before the trial, to
one offence of cheating the Revenue.
During the two-month trial the prosecution said the fraud was by far the
largest ever perpetrated on the Revenue. The 'prime mover' behind the fraud,
it alleged, was Mr Botnar.
Mr Botnar has remained in Switzerland beyond the reach of UK justice since a
warrant was issued for his arrest in early 1992.

FT  27 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
These are busy times for Forte. While it tries to cement its deal with Ciga
in Italy, wrangling over the chairmanship of the Savoy continues. Although
it has just sold its stake in Kentucky Fried Chicken, a buyer is still being
sought for the Harvester restaurant chain and its airport catering business
is being prepared for flotation. For the longer term, the Ciga deal probably
matters most, so it is disconcerting for Forte to see rivals such as
Marriott also showing interest in this luxury hotel chain. By acquiring the
Ciga brand, which is a strategic fit with its own luxury hotels, Forte would
be making a leap forward in the top end of the market.
Indeed, it would arguably be in the position to walk away from the Savoy,
which remains as elusive a prey as ever. There is no sign of a negotiated
agreement and the rolling 12-month notice which Forte must give of intention
to bid is not much use when any such announcement would drive the Savoy
share price higher. With Ciga in its portfolio, Forte might persuade the
Savoy to negotiate. Otherwise it is hard to see how the process can be moved
on. Forte remains unwilling to break its agreement not to buy more Savoy
shares in the market, which would be expensive anyway at levels around
Pounds 8. Faced with such prolonged uncertainty it might even decide it was
not worth hanging on.
As for the disposals, each one makes the risk of a rights issue more remote.
Kentucky Fried Chicken is more sensitive to the cycle than Gardner Merchant
and the airport catering business, but the disposals do lessen Forte's
ability to offset the UK hotel cycle. The effect would be lessened by a
greater presence in the the European luxury hotel market - which is where
the Ciga deal comes in again.

FT  27 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BTR busy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR was by far the busiest stock with turnover in the ordinaries reaching
more than 41m shares. Most of this - almost 18m traded at 356p for cash -
was accounted for by the take up of BTR's enhanced scrip dividend. There was
also substantial switching, dealers noted, from the ordinaries to the
warrants.
The ordinary shares closed 5 1/2 higher at 347p. The 1993-94 warrants, up 4
1/2 at 65p and the 1998 warrants, which moved up from 38p to 47p, were the
pick of the derivatives.
The undoubted star of the sector was again Royal Bank of Scotland whose
shares continued their move to record levels after the scintillating profits
performance from Direct Line, the telephone insurance business, which
announced trebled profits of Pounds 50.2m last Thursday.
Royal is scheduled to announce its preliminary figures on Thursday with
analysts looking for profits in excess of Pounds 200m. The dividend total is
expected to rise by 8 per cent to 9.5p. At the close Royal shares were a
further 9 higher at 384p, after reaching a peak 386p. Turnover was a hefty
6.3m.
Marketmakers were said to have been caught acutely short of stock in the
life assurance sector as the market began to take the view that the
chancellor may not, as has been widely rumoured for many weeks, interfere
with the life and pensions sector in the budget next week. Legal &amp; General
jumped 13 to 508p, Lloyds Abbey 13 to 436p and Prudential 14 to 350p.
TSB continued to attract keen interest, slipping back to 207 1/2 p at one
point, the lowest level since the end of September, before stabilising to
close a net 4 off at 209p. Turnover of 4.6m, although by no means
outstanding, was slightly above average.
'There was some stock around and the shares dipped below 210p, which has
been viewed as a support level. If they close below 210p then the charts
point to the shares dropping below 200p,' said one specialist. TSB's
preliminary figures are expected in January.
A strong drinks sector was the subject of some recovery buying, according to
analysts, with a strong sense that the maligned sector was at last beginning
to turn. Among those showing good gains, Scottish and Newcastle gained 10 to
482p, Wolverhampton and Dudley 5 to 488p and Allied Lyons 13 to 596p, with a
Kleinwort Benson buy note adding impetus to the latter's rise.
There were 40m new Whitbread shares issued yesterday, taken up by former
investors in the Whitbread Investment Company which was bought out by its
parent group in September. And next Thursday, when the tightly-traded B
shares cease to exist, a 20m further shares will be issued to existing B
shareholders. These new shares are being issued at 482p, against yesterday's
closing price for the A's of 533p, a rise on the day of 15. Anslysts do
expect some weakness in the shares, but point out that those taking up new
shares have already turned down a cash alternative.
A positive agm statement from Lloyds Chemist sent the shares forward and
also helped Boots. Group sales in the 21-week period were up 9 per cent on a
year ago. Its shares gained 10 to 310p.
Boots shares climbed 9 to 534p in a strong stores sector which had benefited
from a bout of arbitraging against the futures market, according to dealers.
Elsewhere, Great Universal Stores added 15 to 580p, Kingfisher 10 to 667p,
Marks and Spencer 9 to 420p and Next 5 to 188p.
A substantial bear squeeze developed in Delta, the heavy
electricals/engineering group, whose shares raced up 24 to 504p, in
relatively thin turnover of only 406,000 shares.
The performance of the stock was all the more remarkable because one leading
UK house was said to have issued a 70-page sell note on the shares. 'There
are conflicting views on the stock, and the market today was squeezed up,'
said one dealer.' After the market closed Mercury Asset Management said it
no longer had a notifiable stake in the group.
The announcement by Land Securities that it had secured a lucrative pre-let
contract from the Department of Environment launched the shares forward,
finishing 11 ahead at 739p.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Multitone Electronics falls sharply to
Pounds 40,000 at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multitone Electronics, the paging equipment manufacturer which is the
subject of a Pounds 21.5m recommended bid by Champion Technology, the Hong
Kong-based telepaging group, yesterday reported sharply lower interim
profits.
The group warned last month that it expected to report a small pre-tax loss
in the first half because a new distribution agreement had taken longer to
come into full effect and there had been a delay in the introduction of an
important new product.
In the event the group said turnover was better than expected in October,
generating pre-tax profits of Pounds 40,000 in the 26 weeks to October 31,
down from Pounds 875,000 last time.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 12.1m) while operating costs were
higher, particularly the cost of imported components, and market conditions
prevented these increased costs from being passed on. As a result, operating
profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 2.05m).
Development expenditure at Pounds 1.16m was little changed in real terms and
trading profit dropped to Pounds 184,000 (Pounds 932,000).
A disproportionate tax charge of Pounds 209,000 (Pounds 271,000), reflecting
the high level of tax on profits earned in Germany and ACT written off,
resulted in a net loss of Pounds 169,000 or 1.12p per share, compared with
earnings of 7.17p a year earlier.
The interim dividend of 1.5p is maintained. The share price was unchanged
yesterday at 140p, compared with the 143p Champion offer.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Argyll may start to depreciate assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail analysts believe Argyll, owner of Safeway, may be the first of the
big UK grocery chains to start depreciating its land and buildings - a move
which could hit balance sheets and earnings across the sector.
Analysts at James Capel, the stockbrokers, issued an internal note yesterday
suggesting that Argyll, which announces its interim profits next Wednesday,
'may use these results to announce a change in accounting policy and a
modification in strategy.'
Argyll is forecast to announce an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
205.5m to about Pounds 216m. But James Capel says it believes the company is
considering adopting depreciation for freehold and long leasehold buildings.
It says a 4 per cent depreciation of assets in the current year would reduce
pre-tax profits by Pounds 25m, and earnings per share from 26.8p to 25.3p.
Other analysts said Argyll was thought to have been considering the move for
some time, and may now have decided to put it into practice.
Fears about the sustainability of grocers' margins and returns on capital
have raised the question of whether superstore assets should be depreciated
over their useful lives.
Analysts have warned that unless food retailers began steadily depreciating
their assets, they might be forced to make big one-off write-downs.
Wm Morrison is currently the only large chain to depreciate land and
buildings, but at a rate of only 1 per cent a year. Based on 4 per cent
depreciation, James Capel has suggested earnings would fall by up to 12 per
cent at Tesco, and 9 per cent at Sainsbury.

The smoke has cleared a little. After seven long years, the US Congress this
week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations
of Mr Robert Kennedy and Rev Martin Luther King Jr in 1968.
The legislation - known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady, the former
White House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on
President Ronald Reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on
purchases of handguns. It would give law enforcement authorities time to
check the buyer's background.
Advocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over
stubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idaho
and Alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the
US.
The Brady bill's opponents in Congress say it will inconvenience only
law-abiding citizens, not criminals who buy or steal their weapons away from
the government's prying eyes.
They point to glaring failings in the federal government's policing of the
276,000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill's
likely ineffectiveness. For instance, one newspaper reporter successfully
obtained a dealer's licence for his dog by submitting a made-up social
security number.
Studies of state laws requiring some form of background check suggest,
however, that at least some sales to convicted felons have been stopped, and
some suspected criminals have been caught when they tried to buy a gun.
But even the most ardent supporters of the Brady bill acknowledge that it
will make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of
new or used firearms, let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation;
and will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders and 1,400 accidental
deaths involving guns each year.
'The longest journey begins with a single step,' Mr Brady said after the
bill's final passage in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite its uncertain effect, passage of the Brady bill is read by some as a
sign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control. Other
initiatives in Congress and in state legislatures are under way: the Senate
last week agreed in a separate bill to ban assault weapons, a measure
already in force in California, New Jersey and Connecticut. Virginia has
passed a law restricting people to one gun purchase a month.
With the federal government considering the imposition of punitive taxes on
some particularly devastating types of ammunition, the Winchester company
recently decided to withdraw its Black Talon bullet. This is prized by some
game hunters for its killing power but detested by emergency room doctors
for the damage it inflicts on humans as it mushrooms on impact.
The strength of public feeling about rampant gun use has clearly grown in
the face of an apparently unstoppable wave of urban violence that has
brought the rate of death by shooting among young black men to more than 150
per 100,000, and led to the installation of metal detectors in city schools.
The fear of violent crimes such as carjackings and drive-by shootings has
spread even beyond the inner city and into the suburbs and the countryside,
provoking a widespread feeling that something - anything - must be done.
The message from an outraged public is not, however, unequivocally in favour
of gun control.
Paradoxically, while thousands of people have been telephoning their
Republican senators to demand that they stop blocking the Brady bill,
thousands have also been flocking to join the National Rifle Association,
the leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies. In the past year and a
half, it has gained 1,000 members a day to bring its total, which had
declined to about 2.6m in 1991, to a record of about 3.3m. Many new members
and gun owners are women.
Recent election results have shown, too, that simply being tough on guns is
not enough to woo the voters. Although Democratic Governor Jim Florio of New
Jersey came close to victory in the gubernatorial race this month by
striking a tougher stance on both guns and crime in general than his
Republican challenger, Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, this was not enough.
Voters were swayed by economic considerations and particularly by his
first-term tax increase.
In Virginia, meanwhile, Ms Mary Sue Terry, the Democratic candidate for
governor, relied in her campaign on gun control and was thrashed by Mr
George Allen, her Republican opponent, who did not favour tighter curbs but
promised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole.
While such results do not indicate that the NRA has been routed, they have
put the association on the defensive. Most members now favour some form of
gun control, but the core membership opposes all restraints on the sale of
firearms. Their beliefs are rooted in an almost theological  - some would
say fanatical - interpretation of the second amendment to the US
constitution, which states that: 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary
to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear
arms, shall not be infringed.'
'The second amendment is not about duck-hunting. In the 1990s, it is about
self-defence,' says Mr James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief Washington lobbyist.
To many members, the right to self-defence is not just against muggers or
burglars, but against a tyrannical government. Mr Neal Knox, sacked from a
lobbying position with the NRA in the 1980s but now one of its elected
directors, argues that the second amendment is the citizen's 'freedom
insurance plan' against tyranny.
Mr Knox says the Holocaust would not have happened if Europe's Jews had
owned rifles, and if the Nazis had not been able to confiscate guns, thanks
to gun registration laws passed in the 1930s. He also contends that the
solution to Somalia's problems is to arm Somali mothers with AK-47s.
Such beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine
guns, assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets. In the process they have
lost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general and
specifically the Brady bill.
Two trends over the past few years have weakened the advocates of gun
rights. First, left-wing Democrats have begun to champion gun control as a
supplement to tough anti-crime measures, rather than an alternative; they
have recaptured much of the 'tough on crime' high ground by backing boot
camps for young delinquents, harsher sentences and stiffer restrictions on
parole or habeas corpus appeals.
The NRA is trying to fight back with a campaign called CrimeStrike, calling
for harsher measures against criminals.
Second, the NRA's insistence on combating any gun control, even that viewed
as reasonable by a majority not just of the US population but of gun-owners,
has driven away some former political and police supporters.
Senator Denis DeConcini of Arizona, once voted the NRA's 'legislator of the
month', is backing a ban on assault weapons. Delegate Clinton Miller of the
Virginia state assembly, once rated 'A+' by the NRA, now calls the
organisation's top members 'hateful, spiteful, arrogant'.
This alienation is apparent among gun-owners at large. According to a Gallup
poll earlier this year, 57 per cent of people who said they had a gun in
their house also favoured stricter laws on the sale of firearms.
These converts to gun control, however, are a long way from believing that
the answer to violent crime lies in more radical action, such as the
proposal of Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, for a complete
ban on handguns.
Some Americans may move in this direction, but many more may put their faith
in self-defence and buy their own weapons.

Sir, In response to the prime minister's deregulation drive, the Health and
Safety Commission set up seven task groups to review health and safety
legislation. These groups are due to report in March.
As a member of one of these review groups, I wonder why the government has
chosen to ignore this consultation process and announce legislation giving
itself powers to repeal health and safety regulations without debate. In
future, it seems, the government plans to legislate on health and safety
without reference to anyone else. This is not a response to the needs of
business but an attempt to centralise power further.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts Council is told to cut 8% from costs next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, yesterday asked the Arts Council to cut
its administrative costs by 8 per cent, or Pounds 600,000, in the 1994-95
financial year.
This is the minimum reduction recommended by consultants Price Waterhouse
earlier this year. The council distributes government arts subsidies, worth
Pounds 225.6m this year.
Mr Anthony Everitt, the council's secretary-general, said: 'The council will
still be able to carry out its core functions of supporting the arts, and at
the same time develop its policy and advocacy role. It will, however, mean
some reduction in the services that can be offered to the arts
constituency.'
The council may cut its 150-strong workforce by 30, mainly in secretarial
and support posts, if possible through voluntary redundancies. There may be
cuts in research and consultancy.
Mr Brooke wants the council to become more accountable. This could be
achieved by holding twice-yearly public seminars, presentations to the
national heritage select committee, and annual policy seminars. The minister
confirmed the 'arm's-length principle' for arts funding, and said he
considered 'the long series of reviews of the structure of the arts funding
system to be over'.
Mr Brooke said: 'This leaves the council to steer the general direction of
artistic policy and to decide the allocation of resources.
'But with that degree of independence . . . in the use of taxpayers' money
comes also the responsibility for explaining their decisions clearly and
fully.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / From hot commodity to consumer durable: Low inflation will
stop homeowners making large speculative gains in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic conditions which gave rise to large house-price rises in the
1970s and 1980s are unlikely to be repeated even when the recession ends,
say an increasing number of mortgage lenders, estate agents and
housebuilders.
They say the low inflation environment of the 1990s will prevent people
making large speculative gains simply from owning their own homes.
High real interest rates, tougher lending criteria by banks and building
societies and the experiences of purchasers who lost money buying homes in
the late 1980s have conspired to change radically the climate in which the
housing market operates.
Mr Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman and chairman of the National
House-Building Council, warned buyers this week that homes should not be
considered as 'a commodity for speculation' but as consumer products, to be
lived in and used.
Yet the initial cost of monthly mortgage repayments in relation to average
earnings fell this week to the lowest level for 15 years. The basic mortgage
interest rate - after the latest cuts by building societies and banks - is
the lowest since 1968.
Simple sums by Halifax building society and Mr John Wriglesworth, housing
analyst at stockbrokers UBS, show how much the market has changed since
then.
A family buying an average priced home for Pounds 4,650 in 1968 would today
own a property worth about Pounds 65,000, even after recent price falls.
Interest and capital repayments on a 100 per cent mortgage would have been
Pounds 13,670 over the 25 years. In today's money these repayments would
still be only Pounds 39,568.
The resulting profit of more than Pounds 25,000 compares well with other
forms of investment. If the monthly repayments had been invested at 10 per
cent the family would have earned only Pounds 49,000 - and would still have
had to pay for a roof over its head.
Similar calculations on a house bought for Pounds 16,300 in 1978 show that
the family would have repaid Pounds 56,200 in present day values over 15
years. This still leaves a profit of almost Pounds 9,000 on a property now
worth Pounds 65,000.
One reason why buying a house was more attractive in the 1970s than in 1980s
was that annual wage growth outstripped average mortgage rates in all but
two years between 1968 and 1981.
Since 1981 mortgage interest rates have consistently remained higher than
annual wage increases. But this did not deter house buyers, since the cost
of borrowing was more than compensated for by the annual rise in house
prices.
This was encouraged by de-regulation early in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's term,
which set banks free to compete with building societies. Housing loans
doubled between 1980 and 1982 and doubled again by 1987. The weight of money
drove up house prices.
Since 1981 the average price of a house has risen by 162 per cent compared
with a 112 per cent rise in the retail price index and a 143 per cent
increase in average earnings.
House price falls since 1989 have left an estimated 1.3m people with
properties that are worth less than the money borrowed to buy them.
Homeowners in southern England or East Anglia who have seen the value of
their properties fall by 30 per cent since buying would have to wait until
2001 to get their money back - assuming that prices rise by 5 per cent a
year between now and 2000.
In real terms - if inflation is taken into account - it is unlikely they
will ever recover their money.
Mr Wriglesworth said: 'It is estimated that another 1.5m people will have
difficulty in moving because house price falls mean they cannot recover
enough cash to provide an acceptable deposit for a mortgage. Experiences
like these will continue to scar the market even if conditions improve.
'Nonetheless it is still worth buying a home while renting costs about the
same as mortgage repayments.'
The implication for the market is that those who need to move will continue
to buy. Those with less pressing reasons may be put off.
Prices are likely to rise more slowly in this climate while annual
transactions, which have fallen sharply during the recession, are unlikely
to recover to previous levels when the market picks up.

FT  27 NOV 93 / IMF and Algeria to resume debt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials of the International Monetary Fund arrive in Algiers tomorrow for
negotiations with the Algerian government after what has amounted to an
18-month freeze.
However, political instability will make it difficult for Algiers to reach
an agreement with the IMF and its leading creditors on the country's Dollars
26bn foreign debt.
As soon as he was appointed prime minister three months ago, Mr Redha Malek
made public his wish to reach agreement with the IMF and Algeria's leading
foreign creditors. Servicing the debt will cost Dollars 9.4bn this year,
absorbing 83 per cent of exports of goods and services.
Loosening the noose of debt repayments is thus key to increasing economic
activity which depends on the imports of raw materials and semi-processed
goods.
Any agreement with the IMF depends on the ability of Algerian leaders to
implement bold domestic reforms.
A reform package was launched in 1989 which opened up the country to foreign
investment, abolished state monopoly of foreign trade and devalued the
dinar.
However, Mr Malek's immediate predecessor, Mr Belaid Abdessalam, put these
reforms into reverse gear, thus compounding the country's economic woes.
Economy minister Mourad Benachenhou was reported by the Algerian Press
Service yesterday as saying he favoured a rescheduling of the country's
foreign debt, although he said all options 'remain open'.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Water festival leaves Phnom Penh businesses adrift:
Officials found a perfect excuse to oust riverside traders and residents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The owners of floating restaurants and brothels along the riverside in
central Phnom Penh have little to celebrate at Cambodia's water festival
this year. They have been ordered by the city council to move their
businesses to make way for spectators at boat races this weekend. Dozens of
small businesses and hundreds of people living in shacks along the river
bank have also been told to move as part of a 'make Phnom Penh beautiful'
campaign.
The water festival marks a bizarre annual event in Cambodia, when the Tonle
Bassac river reverses direction. During the summer, the waters in the lower
reaches of the river back up and it flows away from the sea towards the vast
inland lake, Tonle Sap.
Then, in November, the river reverses direction and again flows out to sea.
Every year this is the cue for a weekend of national celebrations and for
fiercely competitive boat races in the capital, Phnom Penh.
For months, the Phnom Penh authorities have wanted to move the dozens of
boats and shacks along a mile-long stretch of the river in front of the
Royal Palace. The festival provided a perfect excuse.
At the start of the week, all the people living and working along the
riverside were told they had to move their boats and abandon their shacks
and buildings by the weekend. They held out, but yesterday scores of police
arrived, backed up by armed police and bulldozers, to clear the area.
They towed away the remaining boats and demolished shacks and small
buildings, while people scrambled to gather up their few belongings. The
only buildings to escape were three petrol stations, which would have been
too hazardous to destroy, and a restaurant in a solidly built house, which
the owner's neighbours said he had bribed the police to leave.
By evening, the only remain evidence of the thriving businesses on the river
bank were a handful of signboards and a few unprotected electricity cables.
The city government says it wants to turn the mile-long stretch of river
into a city garden, to complement the large square outside the Royal Palace.
Several months ago, environmental consultants were asked to draw up a plan
to clear the river area of dwellings and small businesses as part of a fight
against pollution.
Most prominent among the businesses which have been ordered by the city to
clear the area is the Phnom Penh Floating Hotel, a luxury cruise ship which
has been moored on the river bank for two years. The ship, which is owned by
investors from Thailand, is one of the most expensive hotels in Phnom Penh.
Its owners were given just three days' notice to pull up their anchor and
leave their river-front site before the weekend festivities. However, they
discovered that they could no longer start the ship's engine, so talks with
the city authorities are continuing.
In previous years, a few floating restaurants have been forced to leave
their sites for the three days of the water festival, but have then been
allowed to return. This year, the city council is determined that they will
not be allowed to come back.
Many owners of floating restaurants and brothels along the river are
determined to return to their prime locations and have pledged that they
would petition the council on Monday. According to one policeman sent to
clear the site: 'If they pay enough, they will be allowed to come back. This
is Cambodia.'

The European Commission has complained to the Russian government about its
restrictions on foreign banks licensed to do business in Russia. The
Commission sees them as going against the grain of a partnership agreement
due to be endorsed next month.
The complaint, in a letter from the European Commission, which has been
negotiating the partnership agreement, comes just before Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Brussels on December 9 to initial the agreement.
Part of the purpose of the trip, just three days before parliamentary
elections on December 12, illustrates the dilemma over Russia faced by the
European Union. Eager to support Mr Yeltsin and pro-reform parties in the
election with this public relations boost, they are limited in how much they
are able to complain.
'We have to be careful about making threats,' said one EU diplomat. 'The
political situation does not allow it. But. . . we cannot accept that Mr
Yeltsin should get away with anything he wants just because of the
election.'
The diplomat also said the EU was alarmed by a draft decree, which Mr
Yeltsin may not sign, limiting the activity of foreign lawyers in Russia.
The partnership agreement grants Russia trade concessions - such as the
right to be consulted before the EU takes anti-dumping action against
Russian exports - while setting a favourable regime for each other's service
industries.
The banking restrictions, reversing the terms of licences already given to
banks to operate in Russia, are in open conflict with Russia's law on
foreign investment and a presidential decree which last month promised to
protect foreign investors.
In Brussels, a European Commission trade official described the banking
curbs as 'a bit of a spanner in the works' which 'makes it a lot more
difficult' to get a partnership agreement by December 9.
He said the Yeltsin government's move placed 'a fairly severe restriction on
our banking operations, until 1996 at least' and wondered whether Moscow was
as anxious for the partnership arrangement as it was last spring, when Mr
Yeltsin was facing a referendum on reform.
But there is suspicion that the restrictions could be a negotiating ploy to
force the Commission's hand on the few remaining items to be resolved in the
agreement, such as Russian nuclear fuel exports. 'We're also aware that the
Russians are very tough negotiators,' the official said.
A last attempt to solve the dispute will be made during negotiations next
week.
Deputy prime minister Alexander Shokhin, who has been negotiating the treaty
and is a candidate for the rival Party of Unity and Accord, has said the
presidential decree containing the restrictions contradicts the treaty. On
banking, all the treaty does is set limits for flows of capital out of
Russia, and on foreign banks' right to deal with smaller depositors.

FT  27 NOV 93 / City anger at community service order for Levitt: Judge says
sentence is 'commensurate' - SFO denies error over plea bargain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office was at the centre of another controversy yesterday
when Mr Roger Levitt, the former financial services salesman who pleaded
guilty to fraud after his company collapsed with losses of Pounds 34m,
walked free from court.
Mr Levitt, who headed one of the most successful financial services
companies of the mid-1980s, was ordered to carry out 180 hours of community
service by Mr Justice Laws following a plea bargain with the SFO's lawyers.
The Levitt Group, which collapsed in December 1990, attrac-ted celebrities
such as former athlete Mr Sebastian Coe, now an MP, and entertainer Adam
Faith to act as directors of its subsidiaries. Its most famous individual
loser was the writer Mr Frederick Forsyth, who lost Pounds 900,000.
The sentence imposed on Mr Levitt, following a three-year investigation and
prosecution by the SFO, provoked widespread anger among both investors who
lost money in the collapse of the Levitt Group and City regulators.
The SFO defended its decision not to proceed with 21 charges against Mr
Levitt and Mr Mark Reed, the group's former managing director, a week into
the trial. These included obtaining property and services by deception,
forgery, false accounting and making misleading statements.
In return, the two men pleaded guilty to a severely limited part of the
indictment against them - a fraudulent trading charge involving the
deception of Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for financial advisers.
The SFO yesterday denied this had been a misjudgment, saying that the
offence the two men pleaded guilty to - which carried a possible seven year
jail sentence - adequately reflected their criminality and that the trial
judge alone was responsible for deciding sentences. Passing sentence, Mr
Justice Laws said he could only sentence on the charges to which the two men
had pleaded guilty. These were comparable to breaches of the Financial
Services Act carrying a two-year sentence. Given their loss of reputations
and fortunes, community service orders were 'commensurate', he said.
In such cases the attorney-general can not appeal against a sentence on
grounds of leniency.
Afterwards a beaming Mr Levitt said he was 'a great believer in British
justice'. The bankrupt entrepreneur - who will now become a vacuum cleaner
salesman - planned to celebrate by getting drunk. 'I will have to borrow the
money first,' he added.
Fimbra said sentencing was a matter for the courts. However, Mr Jim Gaskin,
the Fimbra director of enforcement responsible for the Levitt case, admitted
there was considerable unhappiness at the outcome of the trial. 'Low
sentences for fraud give out the wrong signals to both those who suffer from
fraud and those who perpetrate it,' he said.
The outcome also caused dismay among lawyers acquainted with the case.
Concern centred on how an investigation and prosecution which cost millions
of pounds could end with sentences of community service orders. 'It looks
very bad. I feel ashamed,' said one lawyer as he left the courtroom. 'It's
extraordinary - a scandal,' said a QC who specialises in fraud cases. The
sentence was attacked by Labour front bench spokesperson Ms Marjorie Mowlam,
who said: 'The decision is an insult to many people who suffered at the
hands of Levitt.' One investor said: 'He (Mr Levitt) should pay for what he
has done.'
Mr Reed was ordered to do 120 hours of community service. A third defendant,
Mr Alan MacNamara, who admitted a charge of recklessly furnishing misleading
information to Fimbra, will be sentenced on Wednesday.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Lonrho to finance Libyan film about Lockerbie: Caribbean
shell company set up for Pounds 633,000 documentary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho and the Libyan government have set up a Caribbean shell company to
finance a Pounds 633,000 documentary film about the Lockerbie bombing.
The disclosure of the secret partnership between the UK-based conglomerate
and Libya in the film project comes just days before tough new United
Nations sanctions against the country are due to come into force.
These include a freeze on Libyan assets held abroad to in-crease pressure on
it to hand over for trial in the west suspects accused of blowing up the Pan
Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives.
The deal has prompted a further division between Mr Dieter Bock and his
joint Lonrho chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, who is responsible for
Lonrho's involvement in the film. Mr Bock is known to be embarrassed by the
Libyan connection and wants to minimise business dealings with the state.
But Mr Rowland, who is currently abroad and was unavailable for comment
yesterday, has accumulated what he believes to be evidence that Libya was
not responsible for the bombing and has passed this to UK ministers.
The film is being made by Mr Allan Francovich, a producer from the US who
has made a number of highly praised documentaries about the US Central
Intelligence Agency. It is being funded by Metropole Hotels, which is two
thirds owned by Lonrho and one third by the Libyan Arab Finance Company, the
main investment vehicle of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader.
Metropole has set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the British Virgin
Islands, called Hemar Enterprises. Hemar hired Mr Francovich as director and
producer of a 90 minute television documentary, with a budget of Pounds
632,948. Metropole has deposited Pounds 105,000 of this into Hemar's account
at Credit Suisse in Zurich, Switzerland.
At a Metropole board meeting in August, members were told that talks had
been held between the LAFC and Lonrho directors about the possibility of
making a film on 'Libyan issues'. Mr Rowland then suggested that it should
be financed by Metropole.
One Metropole director, Mr Martin Bolland, said at the meeting that he was
concerned at possible adverse publicity for the group. However, Mr Rowland -
supported by Mr Smeida El Naili and Mr Mohamed Ali El Huwej, both of the
Libyan Arab Finance Company - instructed that Hemar should be set up by
Metropole and should have only three directors: himself; Mr Ken Etheridge,
the former policeman who is head of security at Lonrho; and Mr El Naili.
Mr Francovich said he had complete control of the project and could withdraw
if there was any interference from Lonrho or the Libyans. He said he had
already found out some 'incredible' details about the background to the
bombing and that shooting would start in 'three or four weeks'.
He has requested interviews with the alleged Libyan intelligence agents, Mr
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Mr Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, whom the UK and US
governments want to try in connection with the bombing.
Recently, Mr Rowland said he felt honour bound to work closely with Libya
since selling it the Metropole stake for Pounds 177m in 1992.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: France confirms privatisation of
insurance group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group,
yesterday was confirmed as the fifth candidate for sale in France's
ambitious privatisation programme.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said that the state will sell its
majority stake in UAP, which is the biggest single institutional investor in
France, after completing the sales of Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and
Banque Hervet. UAP's shares rose by FFr8 to FFr638 on the news.
The announcement followed months of political manoeuvring by Mr Jean
Peyrelevade, former chairman of UAP who earlier this month moved to the
Credit Lyonnais banking group. He was anxious to ensure that UAP was
privatised before the other two state-controlled insurers, AGF and GAN.
UAP is now recovering after sustaining a sharp fall in profits in 1992. Mr
Simon Rudolph, European insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley in London,
expects net profits to rise from FFr1.08bn in 1992 to FFr1.8bn (Dollars
300m) in 1993 and to FFr2.5bn next year.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Charges brought by SFO dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three fraud charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office against a group of
businessmen over the marketing of shares in Duralite Manufacturing Company
of the US were dismissed by an Old Bailey judge yesterday.
After 13 days of argument Mr Justice Colman threw out the charges against Mr
Malcolm Johnson of Kitzbuhel, Austria, Mr Alex Dann of Kensington, London,
and Mr Mungo Park of Earls Court, London. There was not sufficient evidence
for a jury properly directed to convict on any of the three charges, he
said.
The three men had denied conspiring to contravene the Prevention of Fraud
(Investments) Act by inducing prospective investors in Duralite with
misleading or false promises and forecasts that Duralite had gold mining and
gold producing assets of value commensurate with its share price.
The three also pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to obtain by
deception.
The SFO is still considering whether to continue prosecuting the men on
other charges.

Dr John Hewson, Australia's the opposition leader, and Mr Conrad Black, the
Canadian media proprietor, are expected to appear before a Senate inquiry
into ownership of the John Fairfax newspaper group, Bruce Jacques reports
from Sydney.
Dr Hewson's decision to appear removed a threat to the setting-up of the
inquiry which requires co-operation between the Opposition and the Democrats
who can together control the Senate. The prime minister, Mr Paul Keating,
has so far refused to appear before the inquiry which will examine
allegations of commercial and political trade-offs between himself and Mr
Black before the Australian elections in March this year.
Mr Black claims that Mr Keating demanded 'more balanced' political coverage
from Fairfax newspapers as a precondition to consideration of any increase
in Mr Black's interest in the group.

Police also raided over 100 Kurdish homes and offices across the country.
The PKK, which demands independence for Kurdistan in south-east Turkey, is
believed to have orchestrated a wave of attacks against Turkish properties
across Europe. The move was welcomed by the Turkish community in Germany
whose members have often violently clashed with resident Kurds.

FT  27 NOV 93 / W German inflation falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rate of inflation in west Germany fell for the fourth consecutive month
and is set to dip below 3 per cent by the middle of next year, economists
said yesterday.
The cost of living in west Germany rose by 0.3 per cent this month,
representing a year-on-year rise of 3.7 per cent. This is a sharp fall from
July, when inflation reached a peak of 4.3 per cent, and from 3.9 per cent
in October.
Although the reduced inflation rate on the face of it encourages market
hopes of a further rate cut, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president,
warned yesterday that the current inflation rate was unsatisfactory.
He said the Bundesbank would only deliver further cuts in interest rates if
this did not conflict with the institution's main objectives of maintaining
monetary stability and preserving the value of the D-Mark.
The publication of the data and Mr Tietmeyer's comments came at a sensitive
time for financial markets, as it is widely expected the Bundesbank will cut
its official rates again before the end of the year at one of the two
remaining meetings of its policy-making council, the first of which takes
place on December 2.
He reiterated the Bundesbank's standard line that it will continue examining
whether there is further scope for interest rate cuts, emphasising that the
decisive factor for German industry was long-term interest rates - at
near-historical lows - rather than short-term ones.
His comments on the importance of defending the D-Mark dovetail with remarks
by Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, who said on Thursday
that devaluing the D-Mark would be the 'the wrong medicine' for reviving the
ailing German economy.
Economists said the Bundesbank would not be rushed into cutting interest
rates, pointing out that indicators other than the inflation rate -
particularly the money supply, capital, and foreign exchange markets - were
being watched closely by the Bundesbank.
But any further easing of interest rates would be welcomed by investors in
eastern Germany, where business confidence in the privatised sector is
showing signs of gradual recovery. In a survey by the Halle Economic
Research Institute of 300 enterprises in the food processing sector, 56 per
cent of those surveyed said the outlook was more positive.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Genetic engineering red tape removed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German parliament yesterday approved a measure that removes some of the
most cumbersome bureaucratic and environmental obstacles to genetic
engineering research.
The measure, which updates the three-year-old law regulating progress in
gene technology, is intended to boost the competitiveness of German chemical
industries, which have complained about unfair research conditions.
It will remove some of the long and costly approval procedures which had
driven many chemical enterprises to focus most of their research in
laboratories abroad, in particular in the US and Japan.
The move is part of the government's efforts to remove red tape and dilute
some of the strictest environmental legislation in Europe, often denounced
as hindering the competitiveness of German industry. 'This is also
particularly important for research conducted in universities and for
smaller enterprises,' Ms Christina Sehnert of Bayer, the chemical group,
said.
The amendment was approved after various versions were rejected by the
opposition Social Democrats, who argue that research manipulating genes
should be closely monitored by the authorities.
While approval procedures will still be required, the amendment greatly
reduces the time involved. It introduces simpler registration procedures for
research classified under the law as safe for the natural and human
environment.

<TEXT>
Will he or won't he? All week I have been in a state of trepidation,
wondering whether Kenneth Clarke Ha Ha Ha, Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer, will dare to introduce value added tax on books and newspapers -
the so-called tax on knowledge - in Tuesday's Budget. I do not have a
surplus of knowledge, anyway, and the prospect that its acquisition may be
taxed has filled me with dismay.
In a flurry of desperation I have been reading book after book - one of
which, called Making of the Modern World, about milestones in science, has
had a strange effect, calming and pacifying me in a way I would not have
thought possible for someone whose normal state of mind as he surveys this
weary planet is one of melancholy.
Making of the Modern World was produced by experts at the Science Museum in
London, and lists 100 key developments in science, technology and medicine.
The photography is superb.
According to John Murray, the publisher, the inventions are presented
chronologically to give an idea of the historical progress made in science,
starting with the Byzantine sundial calendar in 1217 AD through to
genetically engineered mice in the 1980s. Other inventions covered include
Arkwright's spinning machine, Trevithick's high-pressure engine, Elias
Howe's sewing machine, Puffing Billy, the first plastic, Bell's telephone,
early cine cameras, the first tube railway, polythene, the V2 rocket, and
Marconi's first radio transmitter.
Before plunging in, I jotted down a short list of scientific breakthroughs I
would like to see. I did not ponder deeply. The idea was to improvise, at
speed, a list of obvious improvements on the life we live now and see how it
compared with the 100 key inventions listed in the book.
My list: a cure for cancer, and for all forms of illness; an anti-stupid
pill; super-cheap power; a gun that never hits its target; improved human
life expectancy; a way to save the elephant and all God's creatures.
It is not a brilliant list. It is amazingly airy-fairy. Even I can see that
now. But what I hadn't expected was the overwhelming practicality of the 100
key inventions listed by the museum. Most of these gadgets and processes
were the result of centuries' worth of effort aimed at answering extremely
specific needs.
None is airy-fairy, or was day-dreamed into existence. All are tangible and
real. As the Science Museum says, reflecting on these inventions helps us
appreciate why the world of today has become what it has.
An example is Bell's mechanical reaper, designed in 1827 by Patrick Bell of
Carmyllie, Scotland. For centuries, reaping (the cutting of corn at harvest)
had been done using hand-held sickles and scythes, even though a mechanical
reaper had been described in the writings of scholars of ancient Rome.
Bell's reaper proved to be the first workable design. He was ignorant of
previous research, except that of James Smith, and dismissed a succession of
ideas until starting work on a design incorporating the cutting action of
garden shears. A small working model was made in 1827, followed by a
full-scale prototype.
It is not in the least difficult to see how Bell's invention has played its
role in shaping the modern world - or to realise that without it the
European Union, among other ingenious things, would hardly have come into
existence. No Bell's reaper: no Jacques Delors. No Jacques Delors:
pestilence, war and famine across the face of Europe.
Similar trains of thought are produced by contemplating Lister's 1826
microscope, Bessemer's converter, Holmes' lighthouse generator, Crookes'
radiometer, Wimshurst's electrostatic machine, the Rover safety bicycle,
etc.
I am grateful to the Science Museum for helping me see why the world of
today has become what it has. There is a reason for everything. Whimsicality
is useless. An anti-stupid pill (given freely with The Sun) is probably
nothing but wishful thinking.
Thanks to this book, I have grown tolerant and fond of all sorts of modern
phenomena. Motorway service stations. British Rail. Eurotunnel and Euro
Disney. John Major. Prince Charles. Britain's nuclear submarines. Alleged
manifestations of the Virgin Mary. Vong Phaophanit's Neon Rice Field.
How long will this mood last? At least until Tuesday's Budget.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Paris-orientated pleasures - Records / Ronald Crichton
makes his choice for sophisticated stockings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For choosy, sophisticated stockings here are three one-composer packs of
transfers to CD, each Paris-orientated, promising hours of pleasure. The
'Tresors Phonographiques de Jacques Offenbach' MM 34016, 3 CDs (British
distributor Discovery Records, overseas Virgin France SA) contain excerpts
from 21 Offenbach operettas by some 30 artists. They come from a private
collection, spanning the time of wax cylinders up to the outbreak of the
second world war. A feast, then, of humour, satire, irresistible rhythm and
some of the best tunes ever written. Of course the sound varies, but
transfers are well made - there is little of the old hiss-and-scratch.
Among the performers are opera stars like Emma Calve sailing serenely
through the Letter Song in La Perichole and Jussi Bjoerling, superbly
carolling (in Swedish) Paris's song about the three goddesses from La Belle
Helene. Mireille Berthon is in top form as the Grand Duchess of Gerolstein,
gleefully confessing her weakness for the military, and as the bogus
Colonel's widow in La Vie parisienne. Old favourites include Yvonne
Printemps, sending up operatic sopranos who hold on to their notes too long
(in 'Dites-lui', another of the Grand Duchess's indiscretions) and Reynaldo
Hahn, inimitably narrating two numbers from La Boulangere a des ecus to his
own accompaniment.
As for the lighter stage, some of whose bright lights have little or no
claim to singing voices, they excel when it comes to putting a point number
across - Dranem, as the impenitent official in Les Brigands who has blown a
large sum of public money on women and admits he has every intention of
doing so again if opportunity occurs. Some cover both worlds, like the
Opera-Comique baritone Louis Musy, who with his wife so deftly and crisp
projects another excerpt from Les Brigands, describing the tramp, tramp of
the approaching carabinieri, late as usual.
I must not forget two eminent visitors from the legitimate stage, Madeleine
Renaud and Pierre Bertin, in an Alsatian-dialect duet from Lischen et
Fritzchen. Some knowledge of the colourful background of the collapse of the
Second Empire and the beginnings of the Third Republic after the war of 1870
will help. So, frankly, will knowledge of French. Imagine a
non-English-speaking French listener landed with the lyrics in Iolanthe or
Patience. But you couldn't want more agreeable teachers.
Absolutely right for those fascinated by the musico-dramatic byways in Paris
from the mid-1890s to the mid-1920s is 'Les Inspirations insolites d'Erik
Satie' (French EMI, CZS 7 62877 2, 2 CDs). The 'unusual inspirations'
include some of the most remarkable products of the most unusual and
eccentric of leading French composers, the little man with a bowler hat,
beard, pince-nez, overcoat and fetish-umbrella. He played the piano in bars
but was, in the words of his teacher Roussel, 'prodigiously musical'. His
short, satirically or mystifyingly named pieces still tease, perplex and
delight in about equal measure.
Not all the works here transferred from recordings of the 1970s are
unfamiliar - the dreamy, almost motionless, well-loved Gymnopedies
orchestrated by Debussy, for example. Two I did not know, the doleful Les
Pantins Dansent (Puppets dancing) and the Choses vues for violin and piano
are delightful. Three longer, more demanding works, literally extraordinary
are worth getting to know in these high-definition performances.
Satie called his Socrate a 'symphonic drama' but the description would
hardly have occurred to anyone else. It is a deliberately plain,
unemotional, evenly-paced setting of Plato's account of the end of Socrates'
life, given here in the version for four female voices (Danielle Millet,
Andrea Guiot, Andree Esposito, Mady Mesple) and orchestra. Genevieve de
Brabant is a miniature drama (with songs) intended for puppets. Mady Mesple
sings poor, suffering Genevieve's songs sweetly.
Strangest of all is Le Piege de Meduse (Medusa's trap) a 'one-act comedy
with songs' about a Baron Medusa and his entourage, included a stuffed
mechanical monkey which dances and an insolent servant, Polycarp. Genevieve
and Le Piege are graced by the distinguished actor-musician Pierre Bertin
whose virtuoso speaking almost makes up for the absence of texts in the
notes. All three major works are conducted by Pierre Dervaux. There is a
useful note on Satie in the new Viking Opera Guide. Further information and
vivid background material will be found in James Harding's book Erik Satie.
Among the most devoted of Satie's colleagues was Milhaud, one of a group
who, at the family's request, penetrated the humble room where Satie had
lived for years and where no-one was invited. Genevieve de Brabant was among
the unknown works they found There. Two of Satie's songs are included as a
tribute in Darius Milhaud enregistrement historiques 1928-1948 (The
Classical Collector 150 122, 3 CDs.). Riches indeed - the bitter-sweet
Saudades for piano, once so strange-sounding now is so natural, and Le Boeuf
sur le toit, both deriving from Milhaud's time in Brazil; La Creation du
monde, surely de most successful mating of jazz and classical; the three
tiny 'operas-minute' opera on classical subjects (complete); not least, the
popular Scaramouche for two pianos played by the composer and Marcelle
Meyer. Other distinguished performers are the conductor Desormieres, the
pianist Marguerite Long and, among the singers, the baritone Martial Singher
and the invaluable Jane Bathori, - a soprano who gave innumerable first
performances for the younger composers in those years.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: All Poles together - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radio 3 is running a Polish season over three weeks, to mark the 60th
birthdays of Penderecki and Gorecki, and the 75th aninversary of the end in
1918 of Poland's partition. Mostly it is about Polish music and musicians,
not for me to assess; but there are other features on Polish theatre and
current social life.
On Saturday there was an interesting talk on the theatre. In this country we
may think of Polish theatre in the light of Grotowski and Kantor, well
received by critics, less so by the public. Their work was a kind of
dramatic emotion, but it expressed no overt politics, so the Communists gave
it no ban - and no subsidy. The outstanding house was the Stary in Krakow,
playing classics to both public and government approval, as it still does,
with occasional foreign works. But Poland has 65 state theatres, with
inadequate subsidy and inadequate audiences. There is room for action.
Appropriately, the Sunday play was Slavomir Mrozek's Slaughterhouse,
translated by Ralph Manheim, a horrid satire where it is proposed that the
hold that art has on the public might be replaced by killing. The violinist
hero (Nigel Anthony) is responsible; he accidentally brings to life a bust
of Paganini, and the new live Paganini becomes a virtuoso butcher, his
earlier desire. Butchery replaces music in the public mind; at the climax,
the butcher hero, as he now is, is billed to perform on the Philharmonic
platform a concerto for two bulls.
The theme is valid indeed, the public subjection to fashionable beliefs.
Mrozek gives too little to his sub-themes, the selfish love of the
violinist's mother (Patricia Routledge) or the violinist's weakness for a
friendly girl flautist (Emily Richard). The hero does not appear for his
bull-concerto, possibly for one of those causes, but the performance is not
cancelled; the Philharmonic President calls for a substitute from the house.
But the play cunningly ends before he gets a reply.
Some good short programmes illustrated Polish life and times. The political
change has made little difference - 'we are social democrats' - but the
press is freer. Table Talk dealt with the delights of the Polish kitchen,
the accent (as throughout the week) being on Krakow rather than Warsaw. In
Snapshots, presenter Bogdan Frymorgan told of the 'cavalry', the underground
Bohemians of the 1980s who now direct their liberty to the TV. He gave an
interesting talk too about the Wielieczka salt-mines that contain a
17th-century chapel and a basketball-pitch.
Yesterday Wlodek Lesiecki gave a talk-cum-concert of traditional Polish
music, as enjoyable as it was interesting, and far more up my street than
Time and Silence, the first of Brian Morton's six - six] - pieces on Polish
jazz. There was little of this until about 1956, just when I think jazz
began to die.
Since we have strayed into jazz, on Tuesday Radio 2 gave a programme on
Lorenz Hart, to my mind the best popular lyric-writer ever, and this I had
to hear. It was dramatised, with David Suchet as the gay, drinking,
unreliable Hart and Jack Klaff as the composer Richard Rodgers, to whom Hart
had to explain internal rhymes and feminine endings, before putting them so
cleverly into his songs. Lorelei King sang - 'My heart stood still',
'Mountain greenery', 'Manhattan' and more, not a dud among them.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: The Met as it might have been - Susan Moore finds the
refurbished galleries doing a traditional job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The greatest compliment that can be paid to the design of a picture gallery
is to realise that one soon ignores it. Such is the success of the new 19th
century European paintings and sculpture galleries at the Metropolitan
Museum in New York that the visitor presumes this is more or less how they
originally looked. The pleasing proportions and restrained decoration of the
Beaux-Arts classicism, the coherent layout of the galleries and their
sympathetic lighting, are all taken for granted. It is the works of art that
compel our attention.
The Met's latest refurbishment is worthy of a new chapter in the history of
museology because it is not a straightforward exercise in the restoration of
period rooms, as seen in, say, the National Gallery of Scotland. Since the
opening of its permanent galleries in 1880, the Met has been in a state of
perpetual reconstruction. These new galleries were fashioned out of a 1970s
glass and limestone shed of an extension the size of a football pitch. They
were conceived to look as though designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White - the
architects of the Fifth Avenue facade - at the turn of the century. We are
presented with picture galleries as they might have been but never were.
David Harvey, the museum's senior exhibition designer, working with the
curator, Gary Tinterow, and the Philadelphia architect, Alvin Holm, has
played it straight. The classical language of architecture is employed
literately and without apology - and without any tiresome Post Modernist
distortion of detail. The historicism is particularly appropriate given that
most Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art was intended for Beaux-Arts
interiors. Nonetheless, the design betrays the defeatism - or is it
pragmatism? - of our age. It effectively concedes that for non-contemporary
art the sculpture and picture galleries of Soane and Schinkel cannot be
bettered.
Certainly the state-of-the-art former installation was found sadly wanting
after only a decade. In the spirit of the Beaubourg, it offered a vast,
bright, open-plan space studded with 'flexible' star-shaped screens that
provided a confusing multiplicity of vistas and proved too cumbersome to
move. Not least of the merits of reverting to traditional galleries is that
wall space is increased by 30 per cent.
Significantly, it was the Met's curatorial team, and the collection itself,
that determined the design, size and disposition of the galleries.
Presumably its director and trustees were wary of vesting absolute power in
the relatively new breed of superstar architects who have been allowed to
impose their vision on museum design regardless of the works of art within.
There is none of the visual belligerence that characterises, say, Gae
Aulenti's Musee D'Orsay in Paris or James Stirling's Clore Gallery in London
which sets superb Turners in an airport lounge.
The 200ft by 120ft space has been divided into a sequence of 21 galleries.
To the south runs a main corridor which, with a nod to the Louvre's Grande
Galerie, has been widened to display large Salon paintings and 19th century
sculpture. From there one moves into galleries devoted to neo-Classicisim,
Romanticism and the Barbizon painters and on to galleries whose wall space
is tailor-made for the museum's holdings of individual artists. Thus
intimate spaces are provided for Degas pastels and Degas sculpture while the
central double square is given over to a bravura display of Manet.
One is made aware throughout of the generosity of the museum's great
benefactors, from HO and Louisine Havemeyer, Degas's first American patrons,
to the Hon Walter H. Annenberg and Mrs Annenberg who contributed nearly half
of the new galleries' Dollars 11-12m construction costs. The decision by the
much-courted Annenbergs to bequeath their superb collection to the Met in
1990, made after seeing the model of the new galleries, reveals how
important the presentation of works of art has become in museum politics.
The collection was widely believed to be going to Philadelphia.
The promised Annenberg bequest of 53 works of art, a great coup for the
Met's director Philippe de Montebello, will make the museum's Impressionist
and Post Impressionist collection arguably the finest outside Paris. The
extent to which it will complement existing holdings is revealed by its
display in three of the new galleries, until December 12.
Gary Tinterow is to be congratulated for the subtlety of his hang which uses
the vistas through the galleries to integrate this separate group with the
collection beyond. It is possible, for instance, to stand in the same place
to view both the Annenberg and Met portraits by Cezanne of his Uncle Dominic
as a monk, and Van Gogh's 'Wheatfield with Cypresses' of 1889 and the
'Cypresses' of the same year. Tinterow offers any number of thoughtful
resonances throughout the galleries. The only drawback of the vistas is that
they impel the visitor to hurry ever onwards.
The most controversial aspect of this modestly revisionist hang has proved
to be the re-instatement of so many of the academic Salon paintings that had
previously languished in store, and their prominent position. Bouguereaus
and Cabanals are undeniably kitsch to modern sensibilities, but they do
provide an appropriate foil to the Baryes and Rodins. They are even more
relevant to the understanding of the Realists and Impressionists beyond.
If there is one small gripe, it is about the colour of the gallery walls.
The muted greens and blues immediately strike the wrong note. Obviously the
sludge and slurry hues of the 1970s - and the decade's antipathy to dark
reds and cinnamons - have not quite been exorcised.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Don Juan is at home in Glasgow - Alastair Macaulay
spends a happy evening with Goldoni at the Citz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Which city, after London, is Britain's leading city of theatre? The answer
is Glasgow; but few people outside Scotland realise this. In the Citizens
Theatre (with three auditoria, since last year), the Tramway, the Kings
Theatre, and the Theatre Royal, it has both quality and quantity. What's
more, the Citz and the Tramway combine to give Glasgow a range of styles so
broad and so European that any other British city, London included, should
envy it.
The Tramway has a particular record for bringing Glasgow some of the most
important European and British theatre. This is the one British locale to
which Peter Brook brought his Mahabharata, Carmen and (earlier this year)
Pelleas et Melisande; this is where Howard Barker's The Europeans had its
premiere earlier this year; and this is a focal point for the four Romanian
theatre productions currently or recently touring Britain. The
theatre/dance/music company Second Stride has just given here two
performances of its new Escape from Sea, seen in London two weeks before;
and in February Scottish Opera will give David Leveaux's new production of
Britten's Turn of the Screw here.
Glasgow, like Edinburgh and other British cities, has also its share of
shows that London has seen or will see. Peter Hall's new production of Pam
Gems's Piaf, with Elaine Page, which the West End has yet to see, is running
this week at the Theatre Royal. And Hall's 1992 staging of Wilde's An Ideal
Husband, which ran for six months on Shaftesbury Avenue, recently came to
both Glasgow's Theatre Royal and Edinburgh's King's Theatre. (Dulcie Gray
and Michael Denison, in their bit roles, are still clinging on from the
original cast - and now promoted to star billing, just above Kate O'Mara and
Angharad Rees.)
Then there are productions that London does not see, but which tour
Scotland. TAG Theatre's Scots Quair, which ran successfully throughout the
Edinburgh Festival, has recently played at the Citizens Theatre; and the
staging of Jakob Lenz's The Soldiers, which Philip Prowse directed and which
opened during the same festival, is a Citizens production which later
transferred to its Glasgow place of origin. Glasgow also gets to see
productions from Edinburgh theatre, such as the Royal Lyceum's A Midsummer
Night's Dream, the second production by the Lyceum's artistic director Kenny
Ireland, which recently transferred to Glasgow's Theatre Royal for a
fortnight.
But the two contrasting forces that probably do most to define Glasgow
theatre are its old music-hall tradition on the one hand and 'the Citz' on
the other. The music-hall tradition, whose influence percolates through to
the comic roles in the Edinburgh Lyceum's stagings of classic drama, erupts
in the pantomime season. (At a time when trad panto is fading from the West
End at Christmas, various Glasgow venues this December will offer
productions of Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Jack and the Beanstalk, Beauty
and the Beast, Snow White and Mr McScrooge.)
The Citizens Theatre is a source of another kind of vitality, enlarging
Scottish theatre rather than carrying on old Scottish or English traditions.
Since 1969 it has built up a complex reputation, a reputation that includes
sexiness, glamour, freshness, irony, camp, daring and more. It has presented
classics in radical new versions, introduced unknown European classics to
Britain, developed new ways of adapting famous works of literature to the
stage, and presented lively new plays.
The Citz Christmas non-pantomime show, opening next week, will be The Lion,
The Witch and the Wardrobe. Meanwhile the two smaller auditoria have been
launched other productions. There is little to commend in A Stinging Sea, by
Vivien Adam and directed by Maggie Kinloch, currently in the theatre's
smallest space: a crummy psychodrama set on a Hebridean island about a man,
a woman and a ghoul who variously represents the boy the man once was, the
children the woman has abandoned for him, the foetus she once aborted, and
the child one or other of them would like to have. Plenty of sex
(increasingly joyless), even more screaming, but weak female acting and
several narrative cliches.
Upstairs in the Circle Studio, however, the staging of Goldoni's Don Juan -
translated and directed by Robert David MacDonald - is a thrill. No Don Juan
tells quite the same story, and Goldoni's variants are part of this
version's excitement. Here, Donna Anna and Duke Octavio dislike each other
and are only engaged with extreme reluctance; Elisa (the peasant Zerlina
character) constantly tells lies to string along her men; Donna Isabella
(the Elvira character, already deceived by Juan) pursues her former lover in
male disguise, and finds herself drawn to Octavio, her new protector (Anna
even denounces her, falsely, as Octavio's mistress); and Anna's father, the
Commendador, only appears as a living figure, not as a vengeful statue.
When finally Juan is shown to have tricked all the women, and is trapped in
sanctuary, he begins to rave hysterically: 'Elisa - Isabella - Anna - which
of you will murder me?' He dies when the ceiling collapses upon him, but
this act of God is the only hint of supernatural intervention in the play.
All is rational, witty, dangerous, charged. (This is the British premiere of
Goldoni's version: it is astonishing that we have done without it so long.)
The most remarkable character of all is Anna - a proud schemer, torn between
virginal devotion to her father and sensual attraction to Juan, determined
to resist Octavio at all costs and half-repulsed by Juan's more brusque
advances, yet prepared at first to marry Juan even after he has killed her
father. What a role] She is as complex, cold and cruel as one of Racine's
heroines. But I was amazed too by the duplicitous determination of Elisa.
There are less surprises about Juan himself, but Goldoni fleshes out his
lethal, Godless selfishness and hubris with telling detail.
I should love to see a Don Juan festival - maybe at Edinburgh? - in which
this Goldoni was included, alongside those other versions by Tirso de
Molina, Moliere, Gluck, Mozart, Byron, Zorilla, Strauss, Shaw and Horvath.
The only flaw in MacDonald's production is that is Andrew Wilde's chilling
Juan lacks sensual allure. But the staging has psychological depth, glamour,
tension, and spirit. (Andrea Hart as Anna exemplifies all these factors.)
But I should love also to see a Goldoni festival. This year is the
bicentenary of his death, by the way; and the more you see of his work, the
more diverse a master he appears. Just compare - to name but three  -
Strehler's revelatory and humane staging of Le Baruffe chiozzotte (brought
last year to the National), the RSC's current staging of the knockabout
Venetian Twins, and this rational and penetrating Don Juan. No British
theatre has done more to honour Goldoni than the Citz; this is its eighth
Goldoni since 1976. All eight have been translated and directed by
MacDonald. His Don Juan text is exemplary: elegant, intelligent, idiomatic,
and never calling attention to its own cleverness. Lucky Glasgow.
Don Juan continues at the Citizens until December 11; A Stinging Sea ends
tonight - November 27

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: More sax please - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The curious sight and sound of the Pharoah Sanders Quartet is causing some
excitement, as well as consternation, in its short tour of the UK. The
American tenor saxophonist, who first came to prominence beside the late,
great John Coltrane, has found something of a cult following among the jazz
dance fraternity lately. As sometimes happens with the unconventional, and
non-commercial, he is also undergoing critical re-appraisal by the purists,
as torch bearer of what Coltrane began in the 1960s (he died in 1967).
It was the Coltrane followers who played up the jazz boom of the late 1980s
with their tough blowing, get-outta-may-way style, so appropriate for those
restless times. During the same period Sanders, whose own harsh sheets of
sound were confined to the West coast, was making records that would be
snapped up (and sampled) for the dance floor in the l990s as interest in the
new generation of saxophonists began to pall.
Thus the prospect of Sanders' carved mahogany features and long white fringe
of a beard, inscrutable behind dark glasses and scorching tenor, drew an
interesting selection of the jazz listening public to this smoky little club
 -from the middle aged hippies made good to the hep habitues of Camden Lock.
Most would have felt a little shortchanged. For someone billed
(inaccurately) as 'the greatest tenor saxophonist on this earth' in the
promotional blather, Sanders could at least have devoted more time to the
instrument. Wednesday's set opened with a lengthy percussion workshop from
the quartet, employing talking drums and shakers, Sanders bellowing 'There
will be peace and happiness' aggressively into the microphone. To a huge and
approving rush from the audience, he then set about the sax with some
exuberant and often hair-raising split reed technique. The effect is rather
like cleaning your ears out with wire wool.
But the excitement was shortlived. As the band - William Henderson (piano),
Alex Blake (bass) and Sherman Ferguson (drums) - surged ahead
enthusiastically, Sanders stepped out, returning occasionally to shout or
shake and even beat his chest comically. Miserly rations of caustically
liberating tenor technique illicited screams from the audience, as did some
fleet and funky fret work from Blake, but the most plaintive voice of them
all was the one begging for more sax. Instead, Sanders began to beat a large
copper bowl with a mallet.
As with the Sanders sound, so it is with the performance it seems. You have
to take the rough with the smooth.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Prize bed of nails - Off the Wall

There can be little doubt where the real artistic avant-garde was on Tuesday
night. Inside the Tate Gallery the well heeled, black tied, glitterati were
clapping to the echoes the news that Rachel Whiteread had won the Turner
Prize, and Pounds 20,000, for her plaster cast of a room.
Outside, the K Foundation, which has devoted around Pounds 200,000 to
exposing the hollowness of the Turner, had nailed Pounds 40,000 in notes to
a picture frame tied to the railings of the Gallery, and was taunting
Whiteread to come and collect her prize for being voted the worst artist
among the Turner short list of four - or see the money consumed by flames.
Slightly behind deadline Whiteread emerged, promising she would give the
cash to deserving artists.
In terms of mind expanding innovation, and the creation of a challenging
example of conceptualism, the K Foundation won hands down. It had staged an
event, performance art of the highest order. Nailing notes to an empty frame
was a most expressive mockery of the events inside the Tate.
Once again the Turner has exposed the elistist sectarianism of contemporary
art. The Prize is controlled by the Patrons of New Art, a small clique of
dealers and collectors who invariably select artists that they either trade
in or buy. It made a change that the winner was not a sculptor handled by
the Lisson Gallery. Instead it was an artist who works abroad and has
pursued one idea - making casts of everyday objects of a size that can only
fit into museums.
The jury made fools of itself in suggesting that Whiteread's work, 'by
exploring such themes as memory, death, community, isolation and
homelessness, stimulates public awareness of these significant issues.' The
local council at Bow, which had Whiteread's latest commission, the cast of a
house, thrust upon it, showed its stimulation by also voting on Tuesday
night - to knock the house down this week end.
No one can doubt where the true pioneers of 20th century art - the Dadaists,
the Surrealists, the conceptualists, would be on this issue - outside in the
cold, garlanding with notes the empty frame.
Less exalted collectors of contemporary art are well served this week end at
London's Cork Street. For the second year running this bazaar devoted to
20th century art is open all of Saturday and Sunday.
The first event was a great success, with galleries like William Jackson
attracting 2,000 visitors, equal to about three months usual throughput. All
the galleries, including the mighty Waddington, are concentrating on
'affordable art'. Dealers have finally accepted that to beat the recession
they must grow a new generation of collectors, whose cheque books start at
Pounds 1,000 or so, or even less.
Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, used this week's annual
Prudential Awards to mix soft soap and tough talk as he rallied the massed
ranks of the arts infantry to go over the top against cuts in subsidy in
next Tuesday's Budget. He praised to the skies the Heritage Minister Peter
Brooke (to hollow laughter) while stridently making the economic and
spiritual case for the arts.
He even managed a threat. Prudential had told him that its continued support
for the arts depended on the government maintaining its contribution:
business was not going to make good any shortfall in state funding. In fact
the Pru thinks that sponsoring the arts makes good commercial sense. It
invests Pounds 800,000 a year in its awards and although most of the money
goes on advertising and promotion it still hands over cheques worth Pounds
265,000, generally to experimental arts ventures, who must spend the money
on creating new works.
The winner of the Pounds 75,000 big one this year was the Shobana Jeyasingh
Dance Company. It had already received Pounds 25,000 as the winner of the
dance category. The Pru is raising the stakes next year, adding a film and
television category to dance, music, theatre, opera and the visual arts.
Shobana Jeyasingh was a popular winner but it is slightly odd that in its
five years of existence the Pru's top prize has three times gone to modern
dance - Rambert and Dance Umbrella were previous winners. This would be fine
if modern dance was enjoying a popular renaissance but in fact audiences
have been falling and some leading practitioners, like London Contemporary
Dance, are in crisis. Perhaps the obviousness of modern dance gives it an
edge over other art forms in the eyes of the final judging panel.

<TEXT>
The Royal Court Theatre Upstairs is a small space, and the first thing you
notice about the set of Hammett's Apprentice is that the seating has been
reduced to five rows by a needlessly large stage. Everything else about the
production is over-extended. Time itself seems to move slowly during the 150
minute play; or perhaps that is just the effect of altitude in the Upstairs
studio.
Hammett's Apprentice by Kevin Hood charts the emotional career of Mary,
Cambridge mathematician and bellicose feminist. She is haunted by one of the
Tolpuddle martyrs (James Hammett from Dorset in the 1830s), plagued by a
dreadful mother, and troubled by a dying grandmother. Mary meets Alistair
whilst attempting suicide from the 15th floor, lives with him, and takes him
home to her grandmother's funeral. It makes lumbering drama.
The play has the feel of Ken Loach's excellent film, Raining Stones, about
the same Catholic working class culture. But Hammett's Apprentice lacks a
moral, spiritual and dramatic centre. There is little to be learned
historically and less to be gleaned psychologically.
However, Hood writes well enough to suggest a waste of effort. And the
superb acting of Ewan Hooper and Mary MacLeod as the grandparents sustains
the interest if not the action of the evening. There are vivid moments from
Lee Ross as a 1980s over-entrepreneur who stays in touch with the markets
via a box of stolen portable phones. But Hood never creates people and
issues strong enough to sustain a plot.
Repeatedly, characters present their histories as intrinsically interesting,
and the action falters into a series of encounters between people trawling
though the past. Stage drama happens in the present. Hammett's Apprentice
runs parallel to where it should, and needs to be trimmed down, put into the
present and adapted for radio.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: The What? The Iron Man - Alastair Macaulay writes to
his teenage niece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dear Kate,
Well, if I'd known long in advance that Pete Townshend had written his new
rock opera for children 'as a Dad', I'd have asked you to join me for the
first night. He adapted it from the original story by Ted Hughes - who wrote
it for his children. Whoever expected a tale by the Poet Laureate to be
turned into a rock musical? Well, if Andrew Lloyd Webber did it to TS Eliot
(Cats) . . .
Since it's a rock musical, you will think it would suit you a whole lot
better than it does me - you know how we disagree about Les Mis. and Joseph
 -but in this case I'm not sure it would. Hughes wrote the story to help his
children learn to confront fear. All that side of it would interest you. But
I wonder whether the music or the words would get under your skin.
To me, the show's most wonderful feature is Anthony Barclay, who plays
Hogarth, the central role, the boy who makes friends with the huge
metal-devouring iron man, conquers his fear, and wins round everyone else.
Barclay has been in several very different musicals in recent years -
Assassins, The Fantasticks, Children of Eden - and he always makes a good
impression. Hogarth is not the big demanding role he deserves at this point
in his career, but he plays it with such simple integrity that he sweeps you
up.
He never does any of that bright-eyed musical-comedy cutie-pie stuff I hate
so much; he has the kind of bones and dark eyes that are perfect for an
idealistic young hero; and when the shows really lets him sing (not often
enough), he can. (One of the show's mistakes is that, in trying to make
Hogarth sound boyish, it sets his music high; and Barclay is asked to croon
most of it in a pale half-tenor. It's not much of a musical that stops its
leading role from having a really good sing, is it?)
Almost everything else about the show is less than wonderful, but a lot
better than dreadful. It doesn't always tell its story clearly - which could
make a young audience restless. I have a hunch you haven't read Hughes's
tale, but it's probably better (if you go) if the story takes you by
surprise. The words are surprisingly intelligent - not surprising when
Townshend drew them from a story by the Poet Laureate, but surprising when
you think of most recent musicals. Nothing smart-alec about them, and not
too much heavy rhyming; but nothing corny or soupy either.
Not quite enough of the music is really rock. (Do admit you never expected
to hear me say that.) Too much of it is tuneless and beatless - like
ponderous recitative - trying desperately to be expressive, but without
impulse. Parts are discordant (daring in a musical); other parts are almost
like the things children chant in playgrounds. But suddenly there are songs
that loom out and catch everyone up. A Star Spirit sings 'Don't be afraid of
the night' twice in Act One, a beautiful rising melody. In Act Two, she
returns as a man-eating Space Dragon and sings 'I want fast food fast', kind
of dirty.
David Thacker, who helped Townshend to adapt the story, is also the
director. As you know, rock musicals usually depend on scenery and special
effects. This one has a huge 20-foot-high iron man who takes a few lumbering
steps to and fro; the she-Dragon goes high in a trapeze; there is any amount
of scrap metal onstage (the woman next to me said 'I'd like to have a good
rummage'). In the big fight it's not clear at first whether the Iron man is
wielding fire on her or has been set on fire by her. But special effects
aren't really the point (a plus in my book, but maybe not in yours). The
Iron Man is really about psychology - about learning to handle fear and
aggression - and it ends optimistically.
I'm glad you all loved seeing Les Mis. over half-term. No, I haven't changed
my mind about it, I'm afraid. Let's talk about it at Christmastime.
Love from your wicked uncle in the big city.
PS What I'd actually like to know most is whether you've heard of Pete
Townshend. (My taxi driver, who was born in 1962, hadn't) When I was your
age and younger, he was a big name with The Who. See if your father still
has LPs of their music; I used to borrow them from him in the 1960s. To my
mind, the stuff he was writing then still has more edge today. It still
sounds as if he needed to write it, whereas The Iron Man sounds like a task
he had set himself.
The Iron Man continues at the Young Vic until February 12. Sponsored by The

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: The thoughts of Hurricane Mel - Mel Brooks gives his
gale-force views on films, comedy and Hollywood. Nigel Andrews takes cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In hurricane-prone lands, as natives know, the way to keep your home intact
is to open the windows a crack. That way the winds can sluice through,
dissipating force and equalising pressure. The same principle applies when
talking to Mel Brooks. He is one side of his Hollywood desk, cracking
gale-force aphorisms. You are the other, opening parts of your brain you
never knew you could ventilate so Mr B's surplus brio can hurtle through.
Brooks is Hollywood comedy's Force of Nature. He gave us The Producers,
Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. He makes movies that never heard the
words 'taste' or 'restraint'. And even when he has a bad run of
brainstorming - his new film Robin Hood: Men In Tights (opening in Britain
on December 17) marks a slight upturn after recent mishaps such as Life
Stinks and Spaceballs - he is still the man with the loudest, quickest,
freshest opinions on the movie business. No dithering, not even in response
to my first question.
'Raisin toast] Mr Brooks had raisin toast for breakfast]' (This to test my
recorder's sound level; it gets turned sharply down). Like many paid
laughter-makers Brooks knows almost everything about comedy except - we
begin with fundamentals - precisely where it comes from.
'Jokes' ponders the ruminative ball of energy, 'go through a strange
metamorphosis. Time is the important element. A series of events, some
traumatic, some unperceived at the time, merge. And suddenly you're struck
by a brand new idea that's surfaced from the 'mud' of your unconscious
storage bin.'
Brooks's own storage bin is large enough to contain all the mud a humorist
could require. He was born to a large, loud family in Brooklyn. He
gatecrashed world consciousness as a TV gag writer, sharing an NBC round
table with the likes of Neil Simon, Carl Reiner and the man who was to
become his neck-and-neck rival in movie comedy, Woody Allen. And he
progressed through stand-up comedy to stage work and then to making the
movies we know today: frescoes of lunatic ambition and largesse from blazing
Westerns via teeming toga sagas (History Of The World Part 1) to the
all-human-life New York of Life Stinks.
'Ideas that appeal to Woody are to do with defeating death. His big
obsession is immortality. Me, I'm interested in 'social flux'. I don't care
a lot about the psycho-dynamics of a situation. But I care very much about
why - socially, historically - more than 10 people at any time are swayed to
do something together or are oppressed.'
Hence the guest appearances in Brooks movies by Hitler, Torquemada and
others. Hence too his messianic reason for going into comedy in the first
place: 'I thought the world was foolish and I thought comedy was the best
way to express how foolish it was.'
Like many comics turned film-makers, from the Allen of Sleeper to the Steve
Martin of Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, Brooks has found film-making itself a
handy target for that onslaught on folly with his genre parodies, taking the
mickey out of silver-screen tropes and cliches; and doing it all with a
sneaking fondness. 'It's like jazz, it's very satisfying. You take a tune
everyone knows and you play riffs on it. In High Anxiety all I had to do was
take Hitchcock and move him this way or that - a little to the left, a
little to the right - and I got big laughs.'
Give Brooks a broader target to pepper, though, and he is more likely to
attack it off-screen than on. If there has been a disappointing side to his
career, it is that his whirlwind opinions on larger contemporary topics than
movie genres tend to be excluded from his movies. The follies of Washington;
the Japanese 'invasion' of American industry and American cinema; his own
Jewishness and what it means to him.
'Hollywood used to be run by the Jews. You know why? Because in Europe, Jews
could not own land. They were used to being barred from owning banks or
railroads, but they could be 'amusants'. 'Please, amuse us]' So when they
came to America, naturally many gravitated to the entertainment industries.
'Then later, when Hollywood became established as a machine for commerce,
the Jews were thrown out. Today the Japanese own it. (Phone rings in outside
office). They're calling me now]'
So Brooks belongs to the Yellow Peril faction in Hollywood - those who think
Tokyo is bad news for Tinseltown?
'I don't think the Japanese will control film-makers through censorship  -
that's the case argued by 'Would they make a film about Pearl Harbour?'
paranoids. But they'll promulgate a concept that's very dangerous to the art
of cinema. That's the concept of the 'hit'. Money. 'Do the books, do the
books]' The Japanese want black ink not red in the ledgers, and lots of it.'
But Hollywood always wanted that? 'No. Wrong] The Sam Goldwyns, the Louis B.
Mayers, they were out to break even, not make a killing. When they started
out, they knew they were in this small retail business like groceries.
Instead of selling butter and eggs they were selling Dick Powell and Ruby
Keeler. There was no big money in it when they began, but there was great
joy and - the one word that's missing today  - pride] Sam Goldwyn would have
all the chorus girls in a Danny Kaye picture dressed in silk] You never saw
their underwear, but he said they felt good, so they performed better.
'The studio bosses were happy if they broke even and made a modest profit
and could keep what was the glory of those days, the cadres of talent. Fifty
actors, fifty writers, fifty directors in one studio: mix 'n' match]
'Hollywood today - this is the lead of your article] - doesn't want to make
good movies or try out new things, it just wants to make hits. People think
Home Alone is a good movie because it made Dollars 500m worldwide. They
think people enjoyed it because it was good. But people enjoy things that
are easy to assimilate, easy to digest, they enjoy a lot of bland crap. And
the dynamic stuff, the daring, irreverent stuff, that puts them off]'
As Hurricane Mel blows through, I open more parts of my brain to control
damage. He is not quite right. The Golden Age moguls made a fortune not a
'modest profit'. But he is not quite wrong either. Obsessive book-keeping
and cautious, sequel-prone production slates have become prevalent in parts
of Hollywood today: with only the safety valve of TV and video allowing, as
Brooks observes, some of the pressure to be released from the inflated
importance attached to the big-screen hit.
'There is this heaven called video] My last picture Life Stinks had this
Jekyll and Hyde history. It did well in Europe, and Fox who distributed the
picture over there send me flowers every day. It did badly in America and
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer try to run me over: every time I leave the kerb, this
big car with an 'MGM' number-plate bears down on me.
'So video has become our chance for an afterlife. For me, seeing my movies
on video is like going back to TV where I began. On the small screen people
see the humanity again, the little gestures.'
Little gestures in a Brooks film? Well, perhaps. But what we treasure them
for is their rudeness and flamboyance. Brooks himself, in more Brooksian
mood, admits that his flair is for the OTT: 'In the cutting room a take I
didn't like on the set, because it was over-the-top, I'll almost always use
because it was dizzier and more inspired, and the others are too tame.'
Tameness and formula are the things he is quickest to chastise in most
screen comedy today: especially the kind that grew out of the safety-first
TV sitcom tradition, from Roseanne to The Cosby Show.
'TV viewers, especially Americans, are brainwashed into responding to rhythm
not thought. 'De woman wasn't sick]' 'What?' 'De woman was d-e-a-d]' Studio
laughter] They laugh when they're told to laugh. 'Where did she go? Did she
come in there?' 'Come in there? She came in t-h-e-r-e]' Studio laughter]
That's not comedy, that's like a doctor hitting you on the knee to get a
jerk.
'In movies we work in a different way. We work on improvisation and
experiment and risk. We work on a lovely marriage of thought and emotion and
physical activity.'
So what was the next product of this wedded bliss? (We were talking shortly
before Brooks officially announced his Robin Hood project). 'I'm waiting for
something to come up from the dark ooze of my unconscious. Something that
speaks to me about the human condition and how to attack and celebrate it.
Hatred is always a good starting point. I hated racial prejudice and we got
Blazing Saddles. I hated poverty and we got Life Stinks. I hate politicians,
so maybe there'll be a political comedy from me next. Something about the
rich taking from the poor, the poor taking from the rich. Wait]' -
mock-dramatic Brooks pause with hand held high as if struck by shining
vision - 'I see a tall, green man wearing tights . . .'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: LSO free to be imaginative - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the other London orchestras find themselves caught up in a frantic
race to stay alive, the London Symphony Orchestra is in the luxurious
position of having time to think about music. A glance over the autumn
season just coming to an end reveals a higher proportion of imaginative
programmes than with any of its rivals.
In order to please the captains of the arts, each of the orchestras has
taken on board a young maestro who can hoist the sail for 20th-century
music. At the LSO this is Kent Nagano, who is looking a well-informed
choice. At the time of his appointment as Associate Principal Guest
Conductor (how complicated titles get when everybody has to be called
something) he was on the brink of success; now he has definitely arrived.
It is a matter of taste whether his concert on Thursday counted as
imaginative, or just bizarre. Works by Boulez and Mahler found themselves
coupled with Paganini's First Violin Concerto, a showpiece for Sarah Chang,
the highly-publicised teenage violin virtuoso. The result was like looking
down the wrong end of a telescope. The majority of the audience (it was a
full house) had turned up to focus on the tiny musical stature of Paganini.
Very young musicians often face criticism if they fall short in interpreting
great music, but there was no danger of that here. The Paganini is frothy,
insubstantial stuff and Sarah Chang was well ahead of any problems it might
have posed. Her personality as a performer is all confidence, far more
outgoing than the not-quite-so-young Midori was when she first came on the
scene.
Chang attacks the most difficult portions of the music with fearless
confidence and makes a remarkably large sound for one so slight. This
concerto abounds in thirds, sixths and octaves, even in harmonics, with
which she dazzles quite effortlessly. Most talented 12 year-olds would be
happy to get one note so well in tune at a time, let alone two.
While he was looking after the accompaniment, Nagano probably had time to
cast his mind back to Boulez's short Messagesquisse for seven cellos or
think ahead to the challenges of Mahler's Fifth Symphony. As both were being
recycled from a concert the week before, rehearsal time had presumably been
sufficient for Nagano to get the sharpness of ensemble that he wanted.
The Mahler was a virtuoso performance, decisive, big in scale, loud, not
unlike Tilson Thomas (former LSO Principal Conductor) in the same symphony.
Each made his case with panache, but sur-prisingly it was the otherwise more
cogent Nagano who took the Adagietto too slowly and cossetted it to excess.
The finale was also pulled around, but climaxed in a blaze of glory. At
least those who had come to see Chang stayed to the end.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Silja's mature Czech monster / Review of Janacek's
'The Makropoulos Case' in Vienna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After spending most of her career in German roles, Anja Silja has found a
new lease of life portraying the mature female monsters of Janacek's operas.
First came Kostelnicka in Jenufa at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden. Now she
is focusing on the grandest and most pathetic of them all - Emilia Marty in
The Makropoulos Case, which she has just sung in Vienna and will repeat at
Glyndebourne in 1995. Her stage magnetism is perfectly suited to this opera,
so much so that the new production at the Volksoper turns out to be even
more of a one-woman show than usual.
Anyone looking for a summation of all Janacek's previous female portraits -
which is how some commentators view the heroine of Makropoulos - will be
disappointed, for Silja avoids extremes of pathos or the grotesque. Instead,
we get a distillation of the histrionic skills which have made her such a
charismatic singing actress these past 30 years: the erotic power of a Lulu,
the scheming calculation of an Ortrud, the self-destructive passion of
Elektra.
If that sounds more than a touch Germanic, it suits the expressionist style
of this German-language production. The character is established before she
sings a note. The wide-rimmed black hat and fur coat announce a grande dame,
the flowing red wig reeks of temperament and the leather trousers suggest
this fictional 337-year old is real and young at heart. With her tall, slim
figure, Silja carries it off in style, her stage manner a mixture of
purposeful stillness and dynamic gestures. Small wonder everything around
her pales into insignificance.
Act two produces some authentic diva behaviour, and after the subsequent
humiliations - all graphically realised - she sings the closing monologue
from the front of the orchestra pit, dressed in nothing more than a long
black underskirt. What saves it from melodrama is the giant conviction she
invests in every word. The voice is still strong, if not perfectly steady,
and she is more than a match for Janacek's terse declamatory lines.
She deserves better support from her production team. Under Isaac
Karabtchevsky, the Volksoper orchestra was poorly balanced and slack. The
staging devised by Christine Mielitz and her designer Reinhard Heinrich
looked like a bad night at the Komische Oper in Berlin, where both are
based.
The decor was skimpy and poorly lit, consisting of little more than
interchangeable blocks and ill-defined projections. There was too much
movement, much of it needlessly brutalist. As a result, the Volksoper
ensemble made little impact. Kurt Schreibmayer turned Gregor into an ardent
wooer, Wicus Slabbert made an unusually sinister Prus and Ernst-Dieter
Suttheimer's Hauk was a beautifully eccentric sketch.
Discounting visits by Czech companies from Brno and Prague, this is the
first staging of The Makropoulos Case in Vienna. Broucek, Vixen and House of
the Dead have already been given at the Volksoper. Jenufa and Katya Kabanova
are in the Staatsoper's repertory, and Osud was given a concert performance
last year. But judging by this production, the Viennese approach to Janacek
is still somewhat cavalier. Thanks to Anja Silja alone, Volksoper audiences
have seen what Makropoulos is really about.

RETURN TO PARADISE by Breyten Breytenbach Faber Pounds 17.50, 224 pages

THE LADY: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WINNIE MANDELA by Emma Gilbey Jonathan Cape
Pounds 18.99, 328 pages
As South Africa toils towards next April's election and majority rule -
towards the 'New Sarth Efrica' as Breyten Breytenbach puts it - some of
those who fought the long battle for democracy are bowing out: the exiled
Poet, the retired Politician and the discgraced Leader's Lady.
The Poet is Breytenbach, an Afrikaner who fell out with his country(men)
when he married a Vietnamese in the heyday of apartheid in 1973. They were
given a special dispensation to visit his country, a trip which produced A
Season in Paradise. He became politicised and returned illegally on behalf
of the ANC in 1975. He was jailed for seven years - which led to The True
Confessions of an Albino Terrorist. He describes Return to Paradise, an
account of a three-month tour of the country in 1991, as the last part of a
triptych.
He describes a transformed country country which used to be his own but is
no longer. 'Why did I come back? . . . .to complete the incomplete, for
annihilation, deathwish. Why will I not return to stay? Too late now.
Foreigner here. Painted monkey. Bitter dreams . . .'
He is saddened as he zig-zags around the country, interspersing what must be
diary entries with recollections of visits to West Africa, where in 1987 he
helped to arrange the first meetings between South African progressives and
Black Africa. Breytenbach says: 'I am looking at the future and it chills me
to the bone'.
His host, friend and sponsor for the visit is Van Zyl Slabbert, the
politician-academic who quit the whites-only parliament to the anger of his
fellow Progressives in 1986. At the end they have an awful row. Slabbert
shouts at him, 'You make out as if you're the only ones who cares' It is the
South African liberals' indictment of the exiles.
This is a fascinating, quiet, detailed journal, full of acute and witty
insight and striking vignettes.
South Africa's two most famous women are 'Helen' and 'Winnie'. Helen Suzman
was an MP for 26 years and for half of them was the single truly
anti-apartheid figure in the Cape Town Assembly. She was - and is - a
wonderful woman, brave, formidable, indefatigable, witty, twinkling. She
started out on the liberal wing of the United Party in 1953, split in 1959
to form the Progressive Party, soldiered on alone from 1961-74, and only
stepped down in 1989, not entirely happy about the emergence of the present
opposition Democratic Party.
Her autobiography is disappointing only because it does not go far enough.
It reads like an extended version of one of her famous Report-Back meetings
to her posh northern Johannesburg constituency - it describes the detail of
her political career but holds back not just on personal things but on many
other areas of delicacy: for example, her fury at Van Zyl's desertion of the
parliamentary party is inadequately reported, and her thoughts about
'Winnie' could surely have been developed now that she does not have to play
the politician.
Helen Suzman has her place in the history books, and the affection of many
of the leaders of the New Sarth Efrica, but there is a necessary argument
about her role. Did she somehow help legitimise an utterly undemocratic
government which was happy to let her travel the world abusing them? Was she
right, Van Zyl wrong? And, more important, can we now see that her
passionate opposition to sanctions throughout the 1980s was misguided? Or
not? Perhaps she should be best remembered as a most valiant champion of the
oppressed - 'Our Lady of the Prisoners', as Breytenbach once described her.
The story of Winnie Mandela is a terrible tragedy, and Emma Gilbey has had
the sense to tell it straight. As everyone knows, the pretty girl from the
Transkei married the charismatic and much older Nelson Mandela just a couple
of years before he vanished into 26 years of imprisonment.
The young Winnie seems to have assumed that she would deputise for him, but
her qualifications to do so were inadequate, as was her character. She was
very brave but - this is Ms Gilbey's central point - the police broke her in
interrogation in 1969. When she was banished to the Free State in 1977 she
was still very brave but by then something had gone wrong: she had been
abused beyond the endurance of anyone but a saint. There followed drink and
men and money mysteries and a violent temper which, when she returned to
Soweto, were to lead to the notorious 'Mandela Soccer Club' and a reign of
terror which resulted in her house being burned down by her own people. Then
came the kidnapping and murder of 14-year-old 'Stompie', after which she
lost most of her remaining sympathy and eventually came to trial.
Here was a nightmare for the ANC leaders in exile, let alone for her loving
husband-in-prison. ANC leader Oliver Tambo buries his face in his hands:
'What must I do? We can't control her. The ANC can't control her'.
Winnie rapidly became a liability to the entire anti-apartheid movement. The
South African government would have been thanking the good lord, except that
they could hardly risk a long jail sentence when she continued to command
the support of the unemployed and uneducated urban youth. In the end, in
June 1993, the Appeal Court gave her a suspended sentence.
Nelson, out of prison in 1990, left her in 1991, by which time the new
generation ANC leadership had taken necessary steps to sideline her. Was it
the ANC's own fault? In Ms Gilbeys words, in 1980 'the movement needed a
figure within the country who could act cohesively as a symbol to draw the
elements of the 'Release Mandela' campaign together. Winnie came to be
chosen because in the abstract she was the ideal choice. Here was someone in
a tragic situation who was sympathetic and charismatic, who was courageous,
outspoken and to top it all was the beautiful wife of their leader. On paper
she was perfect. But she was not perfect . . .'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Books: Saviour of Spain - or brutal fascist? - The first
comprehensive biography of Franco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCO: A BIOGRAPHY by Paul Preston Collins Pounds 25, 1002 pages
Through a mixture of luck and cautious cunning, Francisco Franco Bahmonde
emerged in 1939 from the Spanish civil war at the head of a victorious army
and became Caudillo of Spain.
The next 35 years, during which he ruled Spain, have come to be seen through
the prism of ideological opposites. Francoists claimed he saved the country
from anarchy and communism, and then went on to lay the framework for a
prosperous modern state with a stable succession.
Franco's enemies never forgave his civil war victory over the Republicans.
To them he was a brutal military dictator who kept Spain isolated from the
mainstream of modern Europe, retarding economic and social development by
several decades. At his death in 1975 he was still type-cast as a fascist
ruler.
However, Franco died in his bed at the ripe old age of 82 while still head
of state, implying he enjoyed a degree of acceptance which his detractors
were never willing to concede. Franco also solved the problem of succession
by restoring the monarchy, something which today might allow the regime to
be seen in a more benevolent light.
This is not the case with Paul Preston, an expert on contemporary Spain and
professor of international history at the London School of Economics. In the
first comprehensive biography on Franco, Preston says he will be remembered
above all for 'his ruthless conduct of the Nationalist war effort between
1936 and 1939 and the determination with which he pursued the systematic
annihilation of his enemies on the left'. At a secondary level he will be
remembered 'for the sheer duration of his survival'.
Franco's achievements, he says, were personal and sectarian. He never made
any attempt to heal the appalling scars left by the civil war. His Pharaonic
monument to the dead, the Valley of the Fallen near Madrid, where he himself
is buried, merely emphasised Franco's vindictive sense of triumph over his
enemies. Thus he was no more than 'a skilful manipulator of power who always
looked to his own personal interests'.
At over 1,000 pages, including footnotes and bibliography, this is a
painstaking reconstruction from every available source. Unfortunately,
Preston's manifest absence of sympathy for Franco colours the tone of his
judgment - even if the general thrust of the judgments themselves are likely
to stand the test of time.
Preston takes the conventional view of Franco's military skill, arguing he
was a safe but unimaginative commander. He faults Franco's excessive caution
for prolonging the civil war. But this overlooks Franco's belief that, in a
fratricidal conflict, a clear victory was essential to ensure subsequent
stability.
The biography is at its most convincing dealing with the tense period in
1940 when Franco was tempted to join the Axis powers. Franco cultivated the
idea that he had saved Spain from involvement in the second world war. The
reality was more prosaic. Franco admired Hitler and believed he would win.
By backing Hitler, he anticipated the victor's spoils of Gibraltar and
French North African possessions. However, Hitler had serious doubts about
the value of Spanish entry into the war, and this gave time for Franco to
reconsider. By then the tide had begun to turn and the Allies were offering
economic aid; so Spain remained neutral.
In his negative assessment of Franco, Preston should have considered whether
in fact Spain needed a period of repressed stability, like that provided by
the Caudillo, to recover from the ravages of civil war and its long history
of political instability. The civil war had in part been provoked by the
advent of the republic in the 1930s and the introduction at a forced pace of
a secular democratic state when there had been no such previous tradition.
Linked to this is the issue whether Franco, having come to power by accident
rather than design, should have stepped aside. And if so, how and when? The
earliest feasible moment would have been in 1946. Then concerted Allied
pressure might have forced him to step down in favour of Don Juan as part of
an internationally-negotiated settlement that included Spain in the Marshall
Plan.
But Franco had by then acquired a taste for power and the monarchist
solution was fraught with danger. The monarchy was not particularly popular,
the previous monarch, Alfonso X111 having done little to distinguish himself
off the hunting field and out of the bedroom. Don Juan himself was a weak
figure with little appeal to the Republicans other than as a means of
ousting Franco and his fascist supporters in the Falange movement. At this
stage the army, the pillar of Franco's power, was dead against any
reconciliation with the Republicans and there was still a guerilla problem
inside Spain.
Thus Franco stayed on, a prisoner of his and the regime's fear of
instability. But Franco always had the monarchist solution in mind and
astutely coopted the monarchy by persuading Don Juan to educate his son, the
future King Juan Carlos, in Spain.
Franco's fierce anti-communism meant that he could count on US and Vatican
protection at the onset of the Cold War. Despite public anti-Franco
posturing, no western government seriously challenged the status quo in
Spain. In fact, the stability of the Franco regime (and that of his fellow
dictator Salazar in Portugal) removed one post-war security problem for
Nato. Meanwhile, Franco was flexible enough to tolerate a degree of internal
opposition and was willing to listen to technocrats who persuaded him in
1956-57 to drop the economic policy of autarchy and begin to liberalise.
His enemies crushed, and only mildly molested by hostility, much of Franco's
rule was surprisingly easy. As the years went on, he spent more and more
time shooting and fishing, less and less dealing with the cabinet.
Fortunately, he could depend upon the loyal services of Admiral Luis Carrero
Blanco, who ran government business and shielded his senility. Franco is
supposed to have had two in-trays on his desk - one labelled 'problems
solved in time' and the other 'problems solved by time'. He just shuffled
paper from one to the other.
Franco emerges from this biography a dull, rather mediocre figure - the
proverbial sphynx without a secret. Yet Preston has avoided psychological
analysis, leaving plenty of room for others to investigate the formative
influences on Franco - such as his small stature, his pious mother and
dissolute father, the near-fatal wound sustained as a young officer in
Morocco, his bossy and socially pretentious wife, Dona Carmen. This might
show Franco was not quite as dull as Preston makes him out.

PATRICK HAMILTON: A LIFE by Sean French Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 20, 327 pages
The financial anxiety that dogs most young writers of fiction ceased for
Patrick Hamilton in his mid-twenties when he wrote those two spine-chilling
plays, Rope and Gaslight. But in spite of this great popular success before
the second world war, Hamilton was often in a distressed state, and the
conditioned worsened as he grew older.
He came from an eccentric family most of whose members were writers. He
inherited a history of alcoholism and instability, and he succumbed like his
father to excessive drinking, half-ruining a brilliant career. Happily the
royalties from his plays continued to flow for the whole of his life, and
still do. He died in 1962.
The plays were ideal for filming by Hitchcock. The director rejected
Gaslight when it was offered him by Selznick who had bought the rights but
he eventually made Rope in 1948 with James Stewart. As an experiment he
filmed it exclusively in one interior set with no jump-cuts, curiously
weakening the macabre tension of the play. Sean French regards the film as a
transitional work in the Hitchcock canon, preparing the way for Strangers on
a Train made from a book by a novelist who rivals Hamilton in her portrayals
of plausible con men, Patricia Highsmith.
Like the Victorian novelist Geoge Gissing whom he admired, Hamilton
penetrated both the genteel and nether worlds of class-ridden Britain
depicting the unclassed individuals, those torn between the two, he found
there. In The Siege of Pleasure (part two of Hamilton's London trilogy,
Twenty Thousand Streets under the Sky) he showed how easily a respectable,
exceptionally pretty servant girl might become a hardened prostitute.
Hamilton's fascination with street-walkers provided him with several
narratives but, unlike Gissing, he stopped short at marrying one. His first
wife Lois came like him from the cultivated middle-class and his second from
the minor nobility. She too wrote novels.
Hamilton was a curious case of someone who since his boyhood in Hove,
observed the world of drunks and psychopaths with clinical detachment, and
reproduced it to perfection in his fiction; his masterpiece Hangover Square,
a murder story, is largely set in a seedy pub in Earls Court during the
period of Munich and appeasement whose mood it captures exactly. In his
maturity, to the horror of his friends, Hamilton grew to resemble a saloon
bar drunk in one of his early novels.
Sean French does not offer any particular explanation for Hamilton's
personal decline. He focuses instead on the good work that Hamilton was able
to do after he had undergone electric shock treatment and other forms of
therapy. Finally French points to one surviving document that he considers
may have effectively ended Hamilton's writing career. This was a letter in
1952 from Michael Sadleir, the head of Hamilton's publisher, Constable,
giving his reaction to the novel later published as Mr Stimpson and Mr
Gorse. It must be one of the most wounding letters any novelist has ever
received on submission of a manuscript, and it certainly toppled Hamilton's
always shaky self-confidence.
French rates the book when read today as 'a masterpiece of comedy', a
significant advance on its predecessor, The West Pier, set in blowsy
Brighton like much of Hamilton's fiction, and he suggests that Sadleir, then
in his mid-sixties was unable to see the merits of a novel 'which struck so
forcibly at his own social prejudices'. Along with Bill Linnitt, the
theatrical impresario, Sadleir had up to that point been one of Hamilton's
greatest friends.
The biography traces the course of his relations with these two men. Male
friendship was a source of strength to Hamilton throughout his life. Other
friends included Arthur Calder-Marshall and John Davenport. His relations
with women were always punctuated by catastrophe.
After the death of his father, a preposterous old tyrant, Hamilton continued
to remain closely in touch with the other members of his family especially
his brother Bruce, for many years a teacher in Barbados. Bruce published his
own life of his brother The Light Went Out (1972), and preserved a family
archive. French has burrowed in it fruitfully and also read all of Bruce's
novels. He shows how Patrick would occasionally borrow an idea from one for
a plot.
French does not stimulate any great desire in the reader to sample one of
Bruce's novels but he makes a strong case for Patrick as a writer who needs
to be placed firmly alongside Orwell and Greene in his accounts of the
horrors of suburbia between the wars. The only work of Hamilton's in which
this sympathetic critic finds no merit at all is his dystopian fantasy,
Impromptu in Moribundia. It was published in 1939 when the writer was at the
height of his fame and a marxist.
A photograph by Bill Brandt shows him a few years later in his smart flat in
Albany, W1 with Terence Rattigan for a neighbour. But even then when
Hamilton seemed to hold all the glittering prizes in his grasp, there were
seeds of disquiet germinating in his mind; he was like that character in The
Heart of the Matter by another Albany neighbour and admirer. The man who
'felt the loyalty we all feel to unhappiness, the sense that that is where
we really belong.'

DENG XIAOPING AND THE MAKING OF MODERN CHINA by Richard Evans Hamish
Hamilton Pounds 20, 339 pages
If Deng Xiaoping's health has been holding up these past few days, he has
probably been watching soccer matches on satellite television, and adding
bits and pieces to half-written, perhaps never-to-be-published articles
about economic reform and Marxism. He has played a few hands of bridge,
flicked through the newspapers, and granted short audiences to the
occasional guest at a heavily-guarded courtyard residence.
Outside the walls of his compound, China is being redecorated. The cities
are painted with bright strokes of neon, streets are lined with aggressive
vendors selling clothes and gadgets from trestle tables that could be the
beginning of a retail empire, and middle-aged Communist party officials
running machine tool companies are discovering that mastering the market is
more difficult than memorising the Four Cardinal Principles or the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existance.
At 89, Deng is unable to comprehend the breadth of change inspired by
China's second revolution, and he has given few clues to the breadth of his
own character. Understanding Deng is much like his own description of the
process of reform, crossing a river by feeling out the stones and, in his
biography, Sir Richard Evans has touched on most of the stones peeking above
the surface of the river.
But Deng Xiaoping and the Making of Modern China provides more insight into
the making of modern China than into Comrade Deng Xiaoping, still generally
described in the West by his unofficial but appropriate title of 'paramount
leader'. In a sense, he is one in a long line of Chinese emperors, though
that comparison understates the complexity of the Communist party leadership
and its diverse networks of friendships, grudges and occasional alliances.
The biography gives a good sense of the survival skills that carried Deng
through this political minefield, in which many of his revolutionary
colleagues perished or were harshly punished by 'comrades'. China's leader
is unassailable because he is almost the last man standing of the Long March
brigade, and because economic reform, a product of the pragmatic side of his
personality, has brought such obvious gains.
But Deng has been ruthless and he has been wrong. In the 1950s, he was
behind the Anti-Rightist campaign that followed a party campaign to
encourage criticism and debate, the Hundred Flowers movement. The flowers
which bloomed were cruelly uprooted and the party's character was changed,
as idealism and honesty were found to be less useful traits than cynicism
and silence.
Not long after, Deng was in the chorus supporting the Great Leap Forward,
which tragically sent the country's economy into rapid reverse at a
still-to-be calculated cost of lives. And there was Tiananmen Square in
1989, the effects of which were obvious to television audiences and the
blame for which must be shared among a two-parts brutal, one-part bungling
Chinese leadership.
To understand these events, we need to be given a sense of the rock
formations below the river's surface and Evans, at this time, is unable to
do that and is reluctant to make broad judgments on the limited evidence
before him. He is not helped by the Communist party's inability to come
clean about its history or by Deng's few public statements of a personal
kind. A doting daughter has recently written in Chinese about her kindly
dad, Deng Xiaoping, but it is not the stuff of critical biography.
Daughter aside, the paramount leader has generally avoided a Mao-style
personality cult, though billboards have appeared with a larger-than-life
Deng urging the country onwards, and his few appearances are seen as heavily
symbolic of something, even if the event happens to be a tour of a southern
Chinese theme park in a golf buggy. The collected works of Deng are clearly
argued, though made dull by the mandatory references to Mao Zedong Thought
and other used concepts that were traded in long ago for a new market
economy.
Deng's achievement has not been to provide a grand vision of China's future,
but to apply nationally the local economic experiments which he could see
were successful. Even the one liners for which he was famous, 'seek truth
from facts' and 'black cat, white cat, the colour doesn't matter as long as
it catches mice', were first said by someone else. As the latter phrase
suggests, Deng's motivation was to build a strong China, not to create a
workers' paradise, and nationalism gradually got the better of communism
when it became obvious that central planning was crippling the country.
In his epilogue, Evans lists the economic gains, providing retail price
index statistics and figures on taxation growth and gross national product,
which, he indicates, provide evidence that democracy should grow more slowly
than GNP in developing countries. As a biographer, and a former UK
ambassador to Beijing, he is a touch too diplomatic in his final judgment,
which he leaves to 'the people of China'.
The statistics are impressive, but China does need a vision, if not many
visions, and the reluctance of Deng to allow more vigorous debate is a
failing that will be remembered. Chinese society has always been more than
the labour cost on an assembled and re-exported refrigerator, but only
economic diversity is officially encouraged. In these years of upheaval in a
great culture, when social comment is needed to provide a context for
change, Deng Xiaoping has forced thoughtful Chinese to be very selective in
their public speech or to be silent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grade I buildings number about 6,000 of the more than 440,000 buildings
listed in England. What is for sale among these buildings of exceptional
architectural or historical importance?
From the 15th century comes The Tudor Shops, a wool merchant's house in
Lavenham, Suffolk, which originally was probably a hall-house (meaning one
that started life as a medieval hall); Pounds 235,000 from Hamptons
(0284-767338).
In Somerset, Poundisford Park was built in 1546 on a typically Tudor H-plan
and still has its Tudor kitchen, built away from the house as a fire
precaution. Its park was enclosed in Saxon times, and King John hunted deer
there in 1208. Stags (0823-662822) invites offers over Pounds 600,000.
Two artists' houses from the 18th century in Hampstead, London, are offered
by Hamptons: George du Maurier's 28a Hampstead Grove opposite Fenton House
and next to Admiral's House in Hampstead village (Pounds 665,000), and
Romney's House in Holly Bush Hill. This was used as assembly rooms in the
19th century before becoming the local Constitutional Club.
Architect Clough Williams Ellis (of Portmeirion fame) converted it back to a
private house for his own use before the second world war, after it had been
assembly rooms in the 19th century and then the Hampstead Constitutional
Club. 'Substantial offers' are invited.
In Devon, Bowden House near Totnes is of Queen Anne and Tudor date. It is
also supposedly haunted, as are the six holiday cottages in the grounds.
Fulfords (0803-864112) is selling this handsome property for Pounds 995,000.
For grade I and 19th century living, 1 Brunswick Square at Hove, Sussex (the
quieter town next door to Brighton), is a classic Regency town house with a
double bowed front; from Hamptons (071-493-8222) for an attractive Pounds
270,000. The square, laid out in the 1820s, is as smart and sophisticated as
any of Nash's grade I London terraces round Regent's Park. In the capital, 5
Belgrave Square is a less ornate building on the north, sunny side of the
square, a speculative leasehold development built by Thomas Cubitt as a
speculative leasehold development on the Grosvenor estate in 1830.
A new, 40-year lease for this desirable address, with a ground rent of
Pounds 5,000 (reviewable in 2013), costs Pounds 3.25m from Aylesford
(071-351-2383) or George Trollope (071-824-8111). A mews is included.
Grade I is also for rent. Clenston Manor near Blandford Forum, Dorset, is
available from January for three years as an assured shorthold, with the
possibility of two more years being available.
The rent is negotiable at around Pounds 25,000 a year, through Savills
(0202-887731 or 0722-320422). The house is Tudor, of knapped flint banded
with green sandstone, but goes back to the 13th century. It has never been
sold.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Property: Making the grade - Listing aims to protect
buildings of merit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listing historic buildings, so that they cannot generally be altered or
pulled down without official permission, is already a fact of life for
500,000 owners, improvers and would-be demolishers, with more listings on
the way.
Officially, there are three grades: I, II* and II. Grade I means they are
'exceptional,' II* that they are 'unusual' and II 'regular.' In all cases,
though, a grading provides the stamp of quality and of architectural or
historical importance.
The rankings help with getting grants from local authorities or English
Heritage (EH), which in 1992/93 paid out Pounds 33m to owners of listed
buildings (Pounds 3m of that for cathedrals and Pounds 9.2m for churches),
and Pounds 7.4m on conservation areas. These grants go usually to help with
major rehabilitation but, for most owners, recurrent maintenance is the
problem: painting, pointing, and clearing the gutters of leaves (expensive
when the builder has to hire extra-long ladders).
Value-added tax of 17.5 per cent is an extra burden on such maintenance.
This is odd when you consider that changes to the actual character of the
building, which need listed building consent (LBC), escape the tax. Whether
painting it an unusual colour or putting in a swimming pool, LBC means no
VAT.
LBC does not come automatically, though. The relevant authority will
probably need plans, charge a fee and check the application minutely. Major
decisions may be referred to EH or such designated amenity societies as the
Georgian Group or the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.
Neighbours and the public can object or suggest changes.
In the 1980s, the then environment secretary, Michael Heseltine, initiated a
major re-listing project which revealed such hidden treasures as Odsey House
in Essex (with work by the 18th century architect, William Kent). It rose
from nowhere to grade I. But some areas still need updating. The city of
Manchester awaits its new lists with 30-40 per cent more buildings, and
Hull's list will be over 100 per cent larger.
By now, almost 10 years after it began work, EH has sharpened its ideology
of listing and its criteria. Contrary to general belief, being listed does
not mean a building cannot be changed. It does mean that changes must be
thought through carefully so they do not detract from the architecture
already there.
That is why LBC is needed - and, almost certainly, will be refused - for
plastic windows. (Planning permission for them is not needed for an unlisted
building; but in a conservation area it might be needed). It is the reason
also why district councils share the decisions with EH and the amenity
societies. In 1992/93, EH dealt with 8,627 LBC applications, 11.2 per cent
up on 1991/92.
With scholarship about the country's everyday architecture bounding ahead,
spurred by the 1980s' re-listing, EH inspectors are more on the lookout for
the medieval hall that might lurk beneath a Georgian facade. And if there is
a sudden threat to an unlisted building of quality - such as demolition -
today's greater knowledge means quicker decisions about whether to use an
emergency procedure known as spot-listing.
It is, of course, better to pre-empt that procedure by deciding in advance
about categories of building that missed listing in the 1980s because they
were too recent or the field-workers found them hard to type. Textile mills
in Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire are under scrutiny and, helped by
recent research, EH has prepared a list of 60, from which 40 to 50 will get
gradings.
While there is no point in listing all the surviving mills of the English
north - there are 350 in Greater Manchester alone - some must be. They are
grand buildings and an important component of the country's history.
Likewise, the British Aerospace offices in Comet Way, Hatfield, north of
London, have been listed both for their architecture and for their links
with the Tiger Moth, Mosquito, Vampire and Comet aeroplanes - history that
could vanish all too easily.
In its thematic approach, EH is also looking at hospitals (helped by the
property division of the National Health Service), cinemas and even pubs (in
association with the Campaign for Real Ale).
With so many hospitals becoming redundant, many pose the delicate problem of
balancing architecture with expediency. 'Listing is fine if there is
re-development,' says William Filmer-Sankey, the Anglo-Saxon archaeologist
who has become director of the Victorian Society. 'It is less helpful if the
building sits empty.'
Holloway Sanatorium (grade I) at Egham, Surrey, is a particular worry.
Nobody is interested in buying it without being allowed considerable scope
for re-development. Meanwhile, it is being vandalised, water has come in,
and it is falling to pieces.
Filmer-Sankey points out that the VS - also an amenity society - is swamped
by LBC applications needing comment. But the system falls down with
neglected buildings like the sanatorium because it is designed to react to
deterioration - by serving urgent works or repair notices that can lead to
compulsory purchase - rather than preventing it. He wishes LBC applications
had to be as detailed as those for planning; that way, the unnecessary
destruction of special features might be prevented.
Most listed buildings date from before the second world war. Listing
post-war buildings had a shaky start when the environment secretary of the
time rejected several of EH's initial candidates. But one building that
passed with a II* grade was Sir Albert Richardson's Bracken House, the
former headquarters of the Financial Times near St Paul's cathedral.
Modern buildings become eligible after 30 years, or 10 years if they are
outstanding and threatened. This year, schools, colleges and universities
entered the lists. But private houses and commercial buildings are still
few, as are churches despite Sir Basil Spence's Coventry cathedral (grade
I).
The Cummins Engine factory in Durham, designed by American architects Roche
Dinkeloo, is grade II* while the Royal Festival Hall on London's south bank
rates grade I. Jacob Epstein's statue of Field Marshal Jan Smuts in
Westminster, and Henry Moore's Three Standing Figures in Battersea Park, are
grade II. EH wants to list more houses, including pre-fabs and some in new
towns.
Any deterioration causes economic harm, and not just to the building.
Buxton, in Derbyshire, is an extreme case. The decline of the 18th century
Crescent (grade I) was damaging the success of other restoration schemes in
the spa town until the Department of National Heritage served a repairs
notice on the owner of a hotel that occupied half the Crescent. The hotel
has now been sold to the local borough council, which was given a 100 per
cent grant from the National Heritage memorial fund, while EH offered Pounds
1m for external repairs.
The other half belongs to Derbyshire county council which had begun repairs
already. By a circuitous route, the Crescent's listing has brought new hope
to Buxton.

FT  27 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Santa, may I have a holiday in Hawaii? - If
children of any age are on your Christmas list and you are stuck for what to
give them, then it might just be worth listening to what the children have
to say. Here, Suzanna Drew-Edwards goes after insider information
</HEADLINE>

So what is it that children really want today? Have playground preferences
for trainers and Nintendo moved on or are they still top of the list?
Hamleys, where approximately Pounds 1bn is spent on toys and games in the
run-up to Christmas, is putting the odds on Sega and Nintendo video games as
best-sellers this year.
Traditionalists will be happy to know that Lego, Trivial Pursuit, Marvin's
Magic and teddy bears also have a place in the top ten. But where better to
go for advice than children? Their Christmas lists are surprisingly varied
and, just occasionally, unobtainable.
Matthew Bushnell, nine years old.
An Airfix model, a calculator, Monopoly, a classical piano cassette tape, an
exciting adventure book, a pair of slippers, a surprise.
'I can do Airfix models by myself now, although Dad does still help me a bit
 -I'm just finishing off a ship. I was given a calculator last year, but it
wasn't very good because it broke the first time I used it. I want a tape
because I'm learning to play the piano and my slippers have holes in, so I
want a new pair to keep my feet warm.'
Oliver Bushnell, seven.
A Backgammon set and a padlock.
'I've only got a pocket set of Backgammon and I want a bigger set. I want
the padlock so I can lock things and keep them secret from my brother
Matthew.'
Winona Navin-Holder, nearly three.
Some fairy dust from Peter Pan, Tiny Tears, the Jungle Book video and a
Beauty and the Beast T-shirt.
'I want Peter Pan to bring me same fairy dust so I can fly to Never Land and
I want a Tiny Tears dolly because my friend Georgia has one and she lets me
play with her.'
Lucy Gosling, eight.
Computer games, a mountain bike, a science kit.
'I'd like some computer games because Daddy's just bought a computer.
There's one called Flight Simulator where you have to land the plane, but
Mummy says it's very expensive. I want a mountain bike because I've only got
a BMX and it doesn't have any gears for going up and down hills.'
Thomas Gosling, six.
'Can I have a Playmobile Lorry? And army clothes for dressing up and
Scalextric and that's all.'
Rebecca Monk, 12.
Money, a holiday, a colour television, a hi-fi system, a set of
encyclopedias.
'I'd like some money to put aside in National Savings so I can buy a car
when I'm older, but most likely I'd go on a holiday to Barbados or Hawaii. I
want the TV and the hi-fi for my bedroom because I spend a bit more time in
there now with friends.'
Christopher Osborne, 14.
Guns and Roses CDs, an airbrush set, Sony Fontopia headphones, aftershave.
'I'm into art and one of my mates has an airbrush set which is really good.
I'd like the headphones so I can listen in peace to my CDs.'
Joshua Drewe, 8.
Jurassic Park Command Compound and an Avanti 2001 car.
'The Jurassic Park Command Compound has an electronic voice which gives out
warnings. I want an Avanti 2001 racing car because it goes really fast and
it has five gears.'
William Mallett, 9 1/2 .
World Cup cricket, some shin pads for football, a Nintendo Game Boy and a
mini-basketball set.
'My cousin has a set of World Cup cricket and it's really good. I want some
shin pads because I play football at school and although I've never played
mini-basketball before, it looks good fun.'
Charlotte Mallett, 11.
Football boots, craft sets, horse books, clothes.
'I play football at school and at home with my brother William and I really
like it. I already have a candle-making set which I enjoy and I'd like
something similar. I want some books which tell you how to care for horses
and some horsey stories because I've been riding for the last year and a
half and for clothes, I'd like some jeans, although not flared ones, some
body suits and a chiffon top. I can wear them to discos and friends'
parties.'
Alice Taylor, nearly four.
Goofy and a trip to the North Pole.
'I want Goofy to come on Christmas day and help me open my presents because
he makes me laugh and I want to go to the North Pole to see Father Christmas
and his reindeer, because that's where Daddy says he lives.'
Caroline Prescott, 13.
A telephone line.
'I'd like to have a private phone in my bedroom so that I can ring my
boyfriend and not have Mum and Dad listening in while I'm doing it and
telling me how expensive the call is.'
Alf and Bert Jones, 15-month-old twins.
Too young to speak up for themselves their mother, Chrissie Probert-Jones,
says that what Alf and Bert really like are buttons - 'they're addicted to
them' - so they will be getting nice chunky Aran cardigans with big buttons
to fiddle with. 'They also love toothbrushes so much that they take them to
bed with them. Bert has six teeth - all corkers and Alf has four neat ones.
They like to have a toothbrush in each hand and tend to fight over them.
'They are fascinated by pens so they'll get a set with safe lids that are
hard to get off. They also love noise and adore musical books such as The
Snowman which a friend gave them last Christmas, so we'll get them another
musical book. They love rattling maracas so we'll give them those.
'We're going to give them stockings with very little in them except masses
of tissue paper which they can crunch up and envelopes that they can toy
with. They are fascinated by electrical gadgets but they will not be getting
any of those just yet. They're just beginning to like piling up bricks and
to be able to fit things together so I think they'd like something like Lego
or Brio.
'Alfie can run - he's been walking for two months already - but Bert just
crawls but they both love trampolining so they'll get a mini-trampoline from
John Lewis. I've given one to many of my nieces and nephews and they've all
loved it.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Good taste for tiny tots / A look at
children's fashions and gift ideas . . . with a little help from her friends
</HEADLINE>

Strictly speaking, I suppose, clothes do not constitute a child-friendly
Christmas present - unless it be the spot-on pair of trainers, the
'must-have' jacket or any other essential part of the tribal uniform.
As a seven-year-old, my own tastes in clothing, indulged by my mother, ran
to fairy tutus embellished with silver stars in which I tore around the
neighbourhood on my bicycle (fortunately no photographic evidence survives).
Children's tastes today seem infinitely more sober. Good taste has reaped
its harvest and at every price there are creamy Aran sweaters, crisp gingham
shirts and rompers, sweet Peter Pan collars and infinitely desirable little
Viyella dressing-gowns.
Those who deem Christmas a suitable moment to replenish a child's wardrobe
will be pleased to know that all this exquisite good taste is available by
mail order. Eleanor House is a small operation based in Gloucestershire
which offers just a few, beautifully designed and made-up children's
clothes.
Mostly knitwear (see the photograph of the jumpers above which range in
price from Pounds 33.90 to Pounds 37.90; the matching hats are Pounds 7.90),
all of it is wearable, desirable and also just that little bit special.
There are enchanting navy and cream cardigans for the small set (from six
months to two years for between Pounds 31 and Pounds 35), there are thick
Aran cardigans and jumpers for children aged from two to 10 (price ranges
from Pounds 32.90 to Pounds 47.90), some cheeky hats (Pounds 9.90) and some
round-collared soft cotton shirts from France (Pounds 14.50). The catalogue
is available from Eleanor House, PO Box 49, Stroud, Glos. GL6 8YA. (Tel:
0453-884192).
Wigglets, 50 Stockwell Park Crescent, London SW9 ODG (tel: 071-738-5124)
sells charming nightwear - everything from brushed cotton tartan pyjamas
(Pounds 23-Pounds 29) and dressing-gowns (Pounds 32-Pounds 41) classical
striped and piped cotton ones (Pounds 23-Pounds 29).
When it comes to toys and entertainment there are three two catalogues in
particular that I think it worth mentioning. Firstly, there is Frog Hollow,
21 High Street, Pewsey, Wiltshire SN9 5AF. (Tel: 0672-64222). There is wide
choice at almost every price range but it is particularly good at the
cheaper end.
For older children and the catalogues brought out by the Science Museum and
the Natural History Museum in London have some splendid ideas. The Science
Museum catalogue includes books on a scientific note (Can You Believe Your
Eyes? - more than 250 visual oddities for Pounds 8.95), pocket microscopes,
the famous potato clock, puzzles, or a large telescope (Pounds 109.95) for
stargazers. And there is much, more.
From The Natural History Museum there is a lot of what it calls 'Dino-fun'
as well as kits to make your own archaeological replicas (Pounds 19.95 for
Jerusalem, Pounds 24.95 for Jericho, Pounds 19.95 for Qumram), a fine
solitaire set (Pounds 49.94) and a solar-powered watch (Pounds 89.95).
Both catalogues are available from Innovations (mail order), Euroway
Business Park, Swindon, SN5 8SN.

FT  27 NOV 93 / How to Spend it: Treasures galore at the ultimate cash and
carry / Preview of the International Antiques Fair at Newark, which draws
thousands of dealers and collectors eager for a bargain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Saturday night hundreds of vans and trucks will roll on to a disused
airfield in rural England in preparation for one of the last big sales of
the year - the International Antiques Fair.
Dealers from across Europe will have been arriving since dawn and the
cavalcade is expected to continue throughout the weekend as container-loads
of antiques converge on Newark in Nottinghamshire.
Trucks will be marshalled into position on a runway where 50 years ago
Polish pilots from 301 Squadron landed their bombers. Like those airmen, the
dealers handle their cargo with care - antiques, like bombs, rarely survive
breakages.
Unwilling to leave the valuables unguarded, many of the drivers will sleep
in their vehicles until trading begins on Monday. They arrive early because
pole position can make the difference between clearing their stock and not
selling a thing.
Although the fair does not open officially until mid-morning on Monday, most
dealers start selling by torchlight around dawn. All manner of antiques from
fine china to poor reproductions are disgorged on to the runway as the the
vehicles - lined up 10 abreast and stretching for more than 1,500 metres -
are opened up.
This, however, is only the queue for admission to the main selling area  -
the adjacent Newark and Nottinghamshire agricultural showground. The
organisers do not like this unofficial runway trade, but they admit that it
is a price worth paying because if the airfield was unavailable the
congestion would stretch for 16 miles.
Among those queueing will be dealers from as far afield as Valencia, Bavaria
and Naples. The reason is simple - turnover. Trade sales at the Newark
International Antiques Fair outstrip all others.
This is cash and carry on a grand scale. More than 70,000 people attend the
two-day fairs, which are held every two months. They are attracted by the
prospect of finding bargains among the wares of thousands of dealers who
prefer to do business here rather than in the aggressive London markets.
Newark has also been able to rely on a geographical location close to the
antique heartlands of East Anglia and midway between London and York on the
Great North Road.
At the last fair in October dealers off-loaded antiques ranging from the
sublime to the ridiculous. In one of the sprawling sheds normally reserved
for livestock, a stallholder selling 18th century gold and silver took
Pounds 25,000 in six hours. No cheques or credit cards were accepted on his
12ft trestle table.
At another stall, an 1850 ormolu table with inlaid boulle work went for
Pounds 725. 'It had lain around for a month without any interest, but went
very quickly at the fair,' according to the dealer. Outside on the runway, a
church spire was sold before the fair opened; nearby a collector haggled
over scrap from a famous battleship.
Ben Whittaker smiles at the memory of the spectacle. The young managing
director of International Antiques and Collectors Fairs (IACF) knows a good
business when he sees one. For him, the antiques trade is far removed from
musty shops or lofty auction rooms. He believes it is fuelled by the
international dealers who flock to Newark.
'We've captured a niche in the market. Before 1985 there were no big fairs,
just regional sales or expensive London shows. We've changed all that.'
The success of Newark has spawned other fairs and IACF now operates more
than 20 around the UK every year. Earlier this year it attracted the
attention of DMG exhibitions, a subsidiary of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust
and the organisers of the Ideal Home exhibition. After months of
negotiation, the Whittaker family sold their controlling shares in IACF but
retained management control of each event.
The undisclosed deal has been estimated at Pounds 7m. DMG has got a bargain,
according to Richard Roseman, a Massachussetts-based collector and regular
Newark visitor.
'This is the world's best,' he says. 'In the US dealers trade off one
another, so if you see something you like it often changes hands and goes up
in price before your eyes. That doesn't happen here.'
Roseman, a collector of glass figurines, is an ideal customer. 'The more I
spend, the happier I am. There is no budget limit.' If he sees something
expensive which takes his fancy, he can arrange the cash from an on-site
bureau de change.
Other overseas buyers come ready prepared. 'The Italians are back into
furniture,' says one dealer with relish. Drivers from Milan and Rome park
their articulated trucks in an international compound on one side of the
fairground. There, they exchange nods and glances with rival buyers from
France, the Netherlands, Spain and even truckers working for a South
Carolina consortium.
However, the Italians are the undisputed masters when it comes to serious
buying around the stalls. They work in four-man squads armed with
walkie-talkies. The buyer sees what he wants, radios the deal to his
controller and, if agreed, a colleague counts out the cash. The other
members then pack it up while the buyer moves on.
These squads are setting market trends far beyond Newark. Christie's, the
auction house, admits it watches what they are up to. Paul Barthaud,
managing director of Christie's auction house in south Kensington, says:
'We always go to Newark. It's a good way of monitoring the market. If the
Italians are back into dark furniture we tell our people in Rome, and it
sometimes prompts us to develop new areas for auction sales.'
Next weekend the Italians will begin arriving again. They will start on the
runway, weaving between the makeshift stalls on Vespa scooters which they
bring for the purpose.
They know what to look for. Motley collections of old pub signs and buckets
of cutlery are ignored. They head straight for the heavily carved furniture,
the jewellery and the silver. 'They are investing in quality,' says Ben
Whittaker. 'They know there is a market for a bit of nostalgia, a bit of
class.'

ANYONE who finds him or herself in London next Saturday might like to take
note that one of the twice-yearly Menswear Designer sales is happening at
the Kensington Hilton Hotel, Holland Park Avenue, London W14.
The women's version of the event has become something of an institution with
many a stylishly dressed woman-about-town buying most of her wardrobe needs
at one or other of these sales. What they have to offer is designer wear at
very reduced prices. Most of the garments are either excess production or
this season's designs that have been over-ordered. Everything on sale has to
be at least half the shop price or less.
Next Saturday is a chance for the man-about-the-house to replenish his
wardrobe. Natty Italian suits (no names allowed but suffice it to say that
they come from the biggest names in the land), chic French ones, some
English suits, starting at about Pounds 100, lots of casual wear, shoes,
socks, shirts, jumpers, overcoats - all the staples of the male wardrobe.
The sale is on from 10 am to 5 pm. Entrance fee Pounds 2.

FT  27 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Designer grunge - Lucia van der Post finds
just what you need / a shabby sofa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shabby has long been chic but seldom more than now. As fashion designers
scour flea markets for inspiration, as Rei Kawakubo - the name behind the
Comme Des Garcons fashion label - goes to infinite (and expensive) lengths
to imbue even the newest of her creations with an air of faded antiquity, as
dressing down is very much the order of the day, so, too, is dressing down
the house. Grunge has hit the drawing-room.
For those who find their own grunge hard to improvise a company called
Shabby Chic has some of the answers. Shabby Chic sells . . . ready-shabbied
sofas. Those of you whose sofas have over the years developed a shabby chic
of their very own - dogs, children, buffet suppers - need read no further.
Those of you who have (sob) sofas that still look shamingly new might like
to hurry down to Shabby Chic.
I would not want to mislead you into thinking that just because chic has
turned shabby it has also turned cheap - dear me, no. Shabby Chic sofas and
chairs, homing in as they do on generosity of size, cost much the same as
new ones.
What they offer instead is that air of having been bashed about, lounged on,
snoozed in by generations of well-upholstered ancestors - with a Shabby Chic
sofa, nobody would ever accuse you of being one of those upstarts who had
had to buy their own furniture.
Shabby Chic's sofas all come covered in loose-covers of plain Jacquard
cotton specially dyed to look faded. They are also pre-shrunk and pre-washed
so they can just be tossed into a washing machine when the shabbiness
finally deteriorates into squalor.
Shapes are plain, simple and traditional. Alicia, which is photographed
here, is the largest, coming in two, three and four-seater sizes and costing
Pounds 1295, Pounds 1394 and Pounds 1495, respectively, for the
beech-framed, foam-filled version, including the scatter cushions. When
sprung with horse-hair and made entirely from natural materials, the name
changes mysteriously to Clarissa and the price rises spectacularly to Pounds
2,530 without scatter cushions.
You might have thought, that the British would do shabby better than anybody
else. I have to tell you that when it comes to proper shabby chic this first
British version is beaten into a cocked-hat by its ultra-chic transatlantic
counterpart (to which it is not officially related).
When I stumbled on Shabby Chic in Manhattan's cool down-town SoHo last year
at first I thought it was a second-hand shop. Seriously faded floral covers,
chairs with authentically lumpy seats and bunches of dried flowers that
looked as if they had withered on the stem right there were were spread
about a suitably tatty interior.
Just as I settled in for a good old rummage among the bric-a-brac it came to
me in a flash - it was all new. Old 1980s-style glitz and glamour may have
gone - but the demand for immediate gratification, it seems, has not. Even
shabby can be provided instantaneously - at a price.
Shabby Chic is at The Plaza, 535 Kings Road, London SW10 OTZ, tel:
071-352-7768. It will deliver all over the country. A catalogue should be
ready in three to four weeks.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Travel: Rioja - abundant food and religion / Adam Hopkins
recommends one of Spain's most scenic regions for a car-spin next spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADAM HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a time, in Spain's Rioja region, a young woman named Oria, wanting
none of the male attentions she received, walled herself up - together,
heaven help us, with her mother. The intensity of Oria's reaction has made
her a specially-loved saint in the locality and one to be reckoned with when
it comes to sexual harassment.
In fact, if you want a collection of unusual saints along with royal tombs
and quirky cathedrals, brilliant scenery and monasteries galore, not to
mention an endless supply of wines both red and white, Rioja is well worth
considering for a car-borne spin in spring or autumn.
Traversed by the Camino de Santiago, or Pilgrim's Way of St James (leading
on to Santiago de Compostela in far Galicia), the Rioja naturally has
religious monuments in abundance. Being also traversed by the rivers Ebro
and Oja - it takes its name from the latter - it has the benefit, as well as
wine, of fertile ground and excellent produce. A good Riojan menestra de
verdura - potage of vegetables - can knock spots off any Provencal
ratatouille.
If I seem partial, please lay the blame on neighbouring Castile where you
are hard put to find anything to eat except roast lamb and suckling pig. At
all events, the much-traversed Rioja is open and civilised in attitude and
happens to have some of the best asparagus and red peppers in the business.
Up in the north the marginally decrepit town of Haro, with bodegas bearing
names such as Muga and L'opez de Heredia, is wine capital of the Rioja Alta,
or Upper Rioja, the most-prized zone of this surprisingly small region.
You can visit the bodegas if you wish, though personally I have always found
one winery much like another. More to my uneducated taste is a non-posh
restaurant called Terete, up in the old part of town, which has a medieval
tunnel with 250,000 bottles in it and a grand hall with a barrel containing
16,000 litres.
Haro also has an agreeable main square, featuring bandstand and cafes, a
proper palace and an 18th century town hall with a road running under it.
There is, however, an even better class of monument not far off in Najera;
and Najera, being on the Pilgrims' Way and a repository of royal tombs,
would do very well for the first stop of a tour.
You will find it where the river Najerilla has eaten a steep cliff into the
cave-pocked, heavily striated, bright red sandstone of a grassy hill. The
kings of Navarre made it their capital for a spell, popping the remains of
their loved ones into a wide-mouthed cave.
The cave was extended outwards by a handsome church which in turn was
equipped with a monastery where masses could be said for the departed. This
was a very normal Spanish arrangement, considered a good investment both by
a grateful church and by crowned heads who looked at their own careers and
feared the worst.
As is often the way with Spanish pilgrim towns, there is a tight little
cluster of ancient streets around one end of the bridge and, with Santa
Maria la Real tucked under the cliff, Najera makes a charming stop. Good
little restaurant, too, named Los Parrales, upstairs in the Calle Mayor at
No 52, with a nice line in white beans and clams - alubias con almejas.
But it is really the next place on my itinerary, San Millan de la Cogolla,
which fascinates me, and, I think, many others. Leaving behind the wide and
open land south of the river Ebro, you climb and climb, through rolling,
partly-wooded foothills, into the halcyon country of the Sierra de la
Demanda: wide skies, well-wooded mountains and the gentle peak of San
Lorenzo rising high above.
Here it was, way back in the 6th century, that San Millan took up his abode,
between a pinnacle of rock and groves of stunted oak. Author of more
miracles than you could fit into a book as fat as the Bible, the saint now
lies, straight-nosed and curly-bearded, in green alabaster effigy, in yet
another cave-mouth in a hillside.
The church built round this cave is extraordinary: two little naves lying
against the hillside, separated from each other by horseshoe arches and with
stonework in a medley of styles going back to pre-Moorish Visigothic. The
place feels intensely ancient and spiritual and is also, beyond doubt, one
of the loveliest corners of Spain.
This is the Monastery of San Millan de Suso. It was here, in a marginal note
on a parchment, that the first written passage of bone fide Spanish was
discovered along with the first known fragment of written Basque. This gives
the place a pivot-like position in the evolution of language, a genuine
thrill for Spanish visitors and ardent linguists.
The next saint on this tour is one of Spain's three Santo Domingo's (another
of the trio founded the Dominican order). This particular holy man built a
causeway, or calzada, for the Santiago pilgrims and lived to a staggeringly
old age. He has a whole town named after him - Santo Domingo de la Calzada,
naturally enough - and he is patron saint of the Spanish Society of
Gerontology, as of the ministry of public works and its highway engineers.
All have left decorative plaques on the railings round his tomb in the
cathedral.
Here, too, you will find a splendid cock and hen, both purest white,
cheeping and pecking away in a wooden balcony. It seems there was a German
pilgrim who resisted the advances of the innkeeper's daughter - a kind of
Santa Oria in reverse. To pay the young man back, she loaded his knapsack
with the hotel silver, told the authorities - and had him hanged.
When the boy's parents returned from Santiago, weeks and weeks later, so the
tale assures us, they found their son still swinging on the gibbet but
otherwise alive and well. They rushed to tell the judge, interrupting his
chicken dinner. 'If it's true,' he said, 'these birds on my plate will
crow.' Which they did, so their successors, generation after generation,
live out a comfortable life in the cathedral.
It seems to me entirely necessary to visit the cathedral and check its
unusually saintly poultry - a short but lovely foothill drive from San
Millan. The inn that features in the story is now a state-run parador: a
comfortable and, in this case, ancient hotel, just open again after
restoration. There is a pleasant dining room, a spectacular arched lounge
and even two bedrooms with whirlpool baths.
The Rioja region of Spain, about two hours south of San Sebastian/Bilbao
along the motorway, is easily reached by anyone driving into Spain via
Bordeaux and Biarritz. A quicker method is to fly to Bilbao. Iberia, Spain's
national airline, flies direct from Heathrow daily, and from Manchester via
Barcelona, from Pounds 162 return (London tel: 071-830-0011). Then pick up a
hire car in Bilbao (Iberia has a deal with Avis).
Least hassle might be to buy a package using the P &amp; O car-ferry from
Portsmouth to Bilbao, with hotels in the Rioja pre-booked: P &amp; O Breakaway
to Spain, tel: 081-863-3787. Two nights on ferry (there and back, 28 hours
each way) with three nights in Spain cost from Pounds 185 per person.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Gardening: Digging in to stop the rot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp weather concentrates the mind, and the past week raises questions of
frost and damp. Despite appearances, though, the frosts have not been so
lethal as weatherpersons inclined us to think.
I measure them by the scale of 1991 when frost at the same season damaged
many of my half-hardy plants, including penstemons, beyond recovery. This
year, their top growth is unscathed, partly because the previous weeks had
been colder and their growth had slowed already. I had also taken a
precaution, which I recommend.
Just before the freeze, I double-wrapped my marginals in that great newcomer
to garden centres, Fibre Fleece. This is a thin, white drape, like a nylon
scarf, which takes many degrees off the frost or wind while allowing water
to pass through and reach the roots of plants underneath. Now, we can wrap
up vulnerable plants without exposing them to drought or rot. Thanks to
Fibre Fleece, I still have unscorched silver convolvulus, living diascias
and last year's verbena.
Fibre Fleece comes in amply-priced packs for people with a few plants which
they treat like pets. Those with bigger gardens should look for the large
rolls at the back of the store: otherwise, they are available from such
trade suppliers of garden goods as Joseph Bentley on Humberside. Owners of
bigger gardens need to shop around.
I wish there was a similar fleecing that would cope with the problem of
damp. Between now and March, this is as much of a killer as frost, but we
hear less about it because its effects are more haphazard.
The thaw after a hard frost begins the problem. The frost upsets the fleshy
leaves on plants like the blue-flowered agapanthus; but the lethal
consequence is the damp, which then sits on the main crown and causes the
plant to rot.
The other day, I read an expert who was saying that my latest pleasures, the
late-flowering schizostylis, are not fully hardy in winter. What he means
(an expert grower assured me) is that, sometimes, they will rot away in a
wet winter or after a thaw. This weakness is widespread, not least among
plants with silver leaves.
As the frost leaves us, how are we to cope with damp? On a small scale, we
can dig grit or gravel round the roots and necks of alpines, pinks and
silver plants when first we put them into the ground. Even now, we can
usefully surround them with a layer of gravel to sharpen drainage until
spring.
On a larger scale, I find the problem more perplexing. How, for instance, do
you deal with endemic damp all over a flower bed? The only answer is to
drain it; but I have always skipped the ritual chapter on herring-bone
drains in the old gardening dictionaries. The FT forgot to check this point
before engaging me, but in those days they had the late Arthur Hellyer
instead. He had land-drained and herring-drained more square rods of soil
than any of us.
What, then, does Hellyer recommend for beds which are turning into a swamp?
His Gardening Encyclopedia (the 1993 edition is published by Hamlyn at the
remarkably low price of Pounds 14.99 for 784 pages) is clear and
uncompromising. On wet land, dig narrow trenches about 12 ft apart down to
the level where the sub-soil becomes a pan on which the water sits. I have
had a trench-digger; as a result, my future carrot bed looks like roadworks,
with a pattern of trenches in which water is now sitting or trickling.
Perfectionists would now lay drainpipes at this level, but I am not entirely
sure we have reached the level where they are most effective. The easier
option is to fill each trench with better drainage: Hellyer recommends
well-burned clinkers from a boiler because they are especially hard and
angular. No doubt clinkers would solve the problem - but, out in the modern
Cotswolds, they have given way to gas.
Certainly, a system of trenches is the answer to a poorly-drained area, but
the cheapest possibility is to trust Hellyer and choose a faggot drain
instead. This under-publicised option has much going for it. You find your
faggots, lay them end to end in the trenches, cover them with turf (placed
with the grass downwards), and then replace the topsoil to cover the burial.
'Well-made faggot drains will remain effective for years,' says Hellyer; in
our gadget-minded generation, though, most of us probably have forgotten
about them.
The question arises: where do you find a suitable faggot? Country residents
will have no problems: they need only to cut bundles of brushwood from a
hedgerow, choosing hazel wherever possible.
These bundles can be dropped into the trench, but you need to be sure the
wood is not too soft or short of side branches. Then, you surface with turf
and replace enough soil for a decent cabbage on top.
If you cannot fleece it, faggot it: damp, at least, can be drained away,
whereas frost retains the unpredictability which caught us all short this
week and makes winter survival such a hazard.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Skiing: Just watch this face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thank goodness I had a bath this morning. A grown man is lying on the floor
poking at my feet, his face millimetres from my right big toe. His name is
Dion Taylor, he comes from New Zealand and his mission is to find a pair of
ski boots that fit me. Since my feet - as I was once told - are like bricks,
this is no easy task. We settle for Koflachs: the RC837 'trouble shooters'.
'We bought this boot specifically for people who suffer from problem feet,'
says the Snow + Rock ski company catalogue, ominously. 'To be honest I'd
like to put you in Salomons, but Koflachs are better for your shape of
foot,' says Taylor, a top man at Snow &amp; Rock, which is supplying equipment
for the 1994 FT Round the World Ski Expedition, during which I will be
skiing every day for a year.
Next to me, my skiing companion Lucy Dicker is having her feet prodded by
another Kiwi, 'Johnno' Carmichael. 'Lucy, you've got very high arches and
you pronate a lot,' he says. 'That means your feet roll inwards when you
walk. We'll compensate for that with our High-Definition Sidas inner soles
moulded to your foot.'
The next stage is to have our boots foamed, and then equipped with Winter
Heat pads - a bit cissyish, but a few comforts will not go amiss since we
will be spending all of 1994 in these boots. Foaming makes them fit snugly
but means getting them on and off for the first few days is a desperate
struggle.
What else? A tough pair of Sorel boots for our evening walkabouts; an
Ortovox Stratus rucksack and avalanche shovel; Pieps Dual Frequency
avalanche transceivers; WRS Sports Med back-supports (corsets to you and me)
and Gul knee sleeves for support.
Then there are Gator fleece-lined face masks; Casio altimeter, barometer and
thermometer watches; Avocet altimeters; Ski Dometers to clock speed and
mileage; security ski locks; and powder traces to prevent us losing skis in
deep powder. Oh, and some skis: Salomon and K2; and Lutah and Degre 7 ski
suits. With everything on, we resembled walking ski shops.
Next stop: the Bio-Mechanical Analysis Laboratory (BiMAL) at Hammersmith,
West London, where physiotherapists to the stars, hold court. Will Carling,
the England rugby captain, was working out a few feet away when we started
training on a Cybex 340. It sounds like a death ray, but it is helping
Carling sort out a problem hip and, hopefully, will help us.
You sit in what looks like a jet pilot's seat and a metal caliper is
strapped around your lower thigh. This device, when linked to a computer,
checks the strengths of your hamstrings, quads, and abductors and adductors
and target any of these for strengthening or recovery from injury with a
programme of weight training. 'Very often energy is wasted by an inefficient
style or limited by injury,' explains Watson. 'Cybex will pin-point any
weakness in strength or symmetry and can even be used to diagnose certain
medical conditions.'
Lucy and I had mixed initial diagnoses - basically Lucy was supple and I was
strong. 'Your overall flexibility was extremely high,' Watson told me. 'But
the strength of your stomach muscles could be better.' Quite.
Lucy, meanwhile, showed 'a very good range of flexibility around the pelvis
and legs, with a full range of spinal movement. The combined strength levels
of her legs was high and above twice her body weight, which was excellent.
But her right leg is 40 per cent weaker than the left.'
Outer fitness is being pursued: Lucy and I visited the Clarins Studio at
Neville Daniel in London's Knightsbridge for what we thought would be a
couple of tubes of suncream and ended up having a three-hour session with
Sarah and Pamela, two Clarins beauticians, who administered head-to-toe
massage, facials and a range of skin products for all weathers.
We do not use soap any more - soap is for the hoi polloi. We have Gentle
Foaming Cleanser, Rich Treatment Cream, Eye Contour Balm and Gel,
Multi-Active Day Cream, Eau Dynamisante, and even Skin Beauty Repair. And
that is just for London. We have not even started with the mountain
moisturisers and potions yet. Watch this face.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Travel: Purpose-built on a swamp - Practical Traveller /
Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Washington DC was staked out of a swamp in 1790 by George Washington and was
the first city to be built as a national capital. It was designed by a
Frenchman with Paris in mind. The result: wide, tree-lined avenues radiating
like a spike from the Capitol and White House, fountains, monuments, parks
and no building that is taller than the dome on the Capitol.
In spring the trees are covered with cherry blossom; in December white
lights glitter on black branches. It is a city of power politics and diverse
neighbourhoods: Capitol Hill, Georgetown, Chinatown, multi-cultural Adams
Morgan, exclusive Dupont Circle.
If you are exploring on foot, the street numbers get smaller as you near the
Capitol. North/south streets are numbered, east/west have letters. There are
Tourmobile sightseeing buses, old Town Trolleys - you can get on and off as
often as you like - and Metrobus. (Metro information: tel: 202-637-700 for
advice).
Metrorail (a one-day pass costs Dollars 5) is possibly the cleanest subway
system in the world - some parts have carpets - and easy to follow. Taxis
are reasonably priced. (A taxi driver from Sierra Leone told me he thought
the US was still the only place where dreams came true, but advised against
venturing into Washington's derelict eastern areas). There are riverboats,
canal barges and helicopter flights.
Hotel rates are lowest at week-ends, around holidays, during mid-winter and
late summer. Many offer free rates for children. The Washington DC
Convention and Visitors Association has lists of all categories of
accommodation, and bed &amp; breakfast (luxury and budget) can be booked through
agencies, though there is a booking fee.
Fitness enthusiasts are well-catered for in several hotels. The ANA Hotel's
superb health centre (2401 M Street, NW) covers 16,000 sq ft and is packed
with gadgets; there is an exercise physiologist on the staff. The Capital
Hilton has jogging routes in its centre, and 250 non-smoking bedrooms.
Washington has more than 50 museums and 70 art galleries, almost all of
which are free and open seven days a week. The Smithsonian National Air &amp;
Space museum - nearly 8m visitors a year - is the world's most-visited
museum, while the national museums of natural and American history are not
far behind.
The White House, the only head-of-state mansion in the world open to the
public without charge, is 19th in visitor popularity, while the
Smithsonian's Anacosta museum comes to the aid of the museum-weary with a
free bus which makes three round trips to its other museums on the National
Mall.
Several new museums worth noting: the US Holocaust Memorial museum
(Independence Avenue and 14th St, SW); the National Postal museum (City Post
Office Building, Capitol Hill); the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery of Art (1200
Jefferson Drive, SW), which has a collection of work by Asian and 19th and
20th century American artists. The Department of the Treasury offers
one-hour guided tours on Saturday mornings - a week's advance registration
is required (tel: 202-622-0896), plus photographic ID on the day. Not new,
but worth visiting, is the Pentagon (202-695-1776).
Information about entertainment can be found in the Friday edition of the
Washington Post and the weekly CityPaper. Half-price tickets to most events,
including sport, can be obtained on the day of performance from Ticket-place
in the lobby of Lisner Auditorium at 21st &amp; H Sts, NW (tel: 202 TIC-KETS for
information.)
Brochures, free maps and advice are available at the Washington Visitor
Information Center, 1455 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, or tel: 081-392-9187 in
the UK. Companies offering short-breaks and longer holidays in Washington
from the UK include: United Vacations (081-313-0999); Kuoni Travel
(0306-742222); British Airways Holidays (0293-615353); and North America
Travel Service, which has offices in Leeds, Nottingham, Manchester and
Barnsley.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Travel: Where the sun god rides the heavens - Nick Haslam
visits India's east coast state of Orissa and the town of Puri, a major
centre of pilgrimage for Hindus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK HASLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a raised embankment deeply shaded with cashew nut and jacaranda trees,
the road ran through emerald green paddy fields. Sari-clad women stooped
among the waist-high rice, and white egrets perched on the backs of
wallowing water buffalo. The air was a heady mixture of pepper flower,
woodsmoke and dung.
Passing a road-side temple, where a smiling goddess sat wreathed in marigold
flowers and incense, our driver brought the Ambassador car to a halt.
Excusing himself, he stepped out to make a small offering and to receive a
dab of red dye in the middle of his forehead from a small boy in attendance.
'The goddess Batamangala,' he said. 'She protects travellers on the road.'
Since survival on the crowded narrow road to Puri seemed to owe a great deal
to divine intervention, I thought that Batamangala must be one of the more
overworked goddesses in the immense Hindu pantheon.
On the east coast of India in the state of Orissa, Puri is one of the major
centres of pilgrimage for Hindus who come to worship at the temple of
Jagannath, Lord of the Universe and one of the most powerful Hindu gods.
The wide main street of the town was packed with a mass of cycle rickshaws,
sacred cows and white-robed pilgrims, with staves and sleeping rolls slung
on their backs. I got out and walked, passing roadside stalls piled high
with small wooden replicas of Lord Jagannath, a simple doll-like figure with
raised arms and wide staring eyes.
One group of pilgrims, small wiry men with aboriginal features who were
happily bargaining for a set of cooking pots, told me they had just come
from Nepal and had been more than a year on the road visiting holy places.
The temple of Lord Jagannath, a massive walled structure of grey stone, was
surrounded by a labyrinth of small streets crowded with pilgrims, holy men
(sadhus) and beggars. The main tower rose to more than 150 ft, from which
long streamers floated languidly in the evening sky. Only Hindus may enter,
and I was motioned to a building opposite, the town library, where a gallery
overlooked the temple.
Below us, a constant stream of the faithful passed through a vaulted arch
into the temple; on its ramparts monkeys gambolled and scratched themselves
in the gathering dusk. Smoke rose from the many cooking fires inside the
compound, where 6,000 temple attendants are permanently employed in building
the huge cars which every year sally forth from the temple carrying the
images of Lord Jagannath and his brother and sister down the main wide
street of Puri.
The vast canopied cars, which have given the word juggernaut to the English
language, are more than 50 ft high. They weigh 100 tons, need 4,000 men to
move them, and are destroyed after the procession each year. Formerly, the
faithful - worked up to fever pitch during the processions - would throw
themselves under the wheels, to be sure of an instant passage to paradise.
Even today, my guide told me, people still mutilate themselves during the
procession. Looking down at the heaving throng, it was difficult to imagine
what it must be like when Puri fills with more than 500,000 pilgrims for the
festival.
To escape the noise and confusion, we repaired to the South Eastern Railway
Hotel for tea. Only half a mile from the temple, we seemed to step back into
an older and more tranquil era as we entered. A long low building with wide
verandas overlooking the Bay of Bengal, its walls are lined with hunting
trophies shot by officers of the Raj.
A row of tall doors opens on to the trim lawn, giving glimpses of large beds
swathed in mosquito nets. We sat on the veranda in rattan chairs under a fan
and a turbanned waiter brought us tea, with fish paste sandwiches and
saffron cake, a combination that brought back dim memories from childhood.
Behind us, a door led to the billiard room, and around a small porthole let
into it at eye-level, bright red letters proclaimed the truculent command:
'Wait for stroke.' Woe betide, I thought, the careless flunkey who barged
through that door at the wrong moment all those years ago. As we talked,
bats flew overhead and the high cumulus hanging over the oily limpid waters
of the Bay of Bengal changed slowly from lilac to purple as the sun went
down.
All visitors to Orissa are duty bound to visit the temple of the sun god at
Konarak a few miles up the coast from Puri. The temple, which rises from the
dunes like a huge jagged molar, depicts the 24-wheeled chariot which draws
the sun god across the heavens. It was built in the early 13th century and
lay in ruins until 1904, when sand drifts around its base were cleared and
the beautiful carvings of the chariot uncovered.
Also laid bare for the first time in centuries was an elaborate and highly
detailed frieze of erotic carvings. The guide was rather coy about the
religious significance of the enthusiastically coupling groups, and would
only say that they were symbolic of the act of creation. The temple, which
would once have been a place of pilgrimage to rival Lord Jagannath, was
crowded with tourists.
Venerable grey-haired sadhus under black umbrellas struck poses and then
demanded a few rupees. Large Indian families dawdled in the pools of shade
cast by the buttressed temple, the women elegant in bright saris, seeming
not to look too carefully at the frenetic activities frozen for centuries in
rock above their heads, while their husbands and sons peeked and giggled,
taking the occasional snapshot.
That afternoon was to be my last in Puri, and I decided to go for a swim.
Nothing is done by halves in India, and I was escorted to the beach of the
hotel by a porter carrying a sunshade, the guide - and a lifeguard. Nearby,
fishing canoes were landing the day's catch, and I went over to see what
they were bringing in. Fine-featured village women bargained hard with
fishermen for the catch, which included shark and stingrays.
I asked if it was safe to swim. 'Oh yes, sir,' the lifeguard said. 'Sharks
are not available in shallow waters.' We left the fishermen and returned to
the private beach. Before entering the sea, I noticed the lifeguard standing
and muttering with his hands held together.
'I prayed to Baruna,' he told me as we plunged into the warm surf. 'The sea
god.' Never, it seems, is the divine very far away in India.
Nick Haslam's visit to Orissa was arranged by the India Tourist Office, 7

FT  27 NOV 93 / Food and Drink: Wine snobs - don't you absolutely hate 'em?
/ Jancis Robinson defers to a man of taste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The person I abhor most in this world is the professional wine snob. The
person I abhor second is the amateur wine snob. And the most boring
conversation you can overhear is the two talking together.'
The man who used to begin his wine classes thus is one of the few whose
assessment of an individual wine I would accept without question.
Almost all of us concerned with selling or advising on wine pay lip service
to the notion that the only thing that matters about wine is how it tastes
and whether you like it, but no-one has put this maxim into practice as
enthusiastically as James Rogers. As a wine merchant and, later, educator
and consultant, he has made decisions about individual wines purely on the
basis of lining them all up and tasting them without knowing what they were
or how much they cost.
'It was my father who told me always to taste blind. 'You'll make a fool of
yourself for the rest of your life,' he said, 'but you'll know more than the
next person'. Wine has certainly taught me honesty and humility.'
A typical Rogers exercise was a lunch last year at which dozens of Britain's
more respected palates were invited to taste seven whites and seven reds and
put them in order of price. My favourite white, for example, was Umani
Ronchi's Casal di Serra Verdicchio (about Pounds 6 at bigger branches of
Sainsbury's and Victoria Wine) which I guessed was far more expensive than a
perfectly respectable premier cru Chablis. I never realised how good it was
until I had tasted it unsaddled with preconceptions about Verdicchio.
James Rogers could not have come from a more traditional background, and
should by rights have become an affable but dozy pinstriped wine merchant.
Raised in the leafy lanes of Surrey, he joined Cullens, his family's firm of
licensed grocers, as a young, failed accountant in 1971. The next year he
had 'an amazing experience'. He tasted La Rioja Alta's Vina Ardanza 1964 and
realised that top-notch wine existed outside Bordeaux and Burgundy (a fact
acknowledged by remarkably few of his peers 20 years ago).
On holiday in California in 1973 he could hardly believe the quality of wine
made there (compared with the produce of Europe in its pre-technological
age). Cullens customers were soon introduced to names such as Robert Mondavi
and Christian Brothers.
He would always taste and then try to put a price on a given wine. 'If I
could still make a margin on it, then I'd buy it', was his philosophy,
regardless of the French-or- nothing mindset then prevailing. Thus two years
later Rogers was the first major stockist of a cheap Argentine wine (branded
Franchette by its importers, presumably in the vain hope that less
open-minded customers would not notice its outlandish origins).
Then in 1979 Rogers tasted the most extraordinary Cabernet Sauvignon
bargain: a deep, fruity red that had all the punch lacking in so much cheap
claret and was available by the tankerload from . . . Bulgaria, a place most
customers would need an atlas to locate. 'It was fascinating how that became
so successful,' remembers Rogers. 'I told all the shop managers to tell
their claret-loving customers to serve it in a decanter and see what their
friends thought of it. They loved it.'
Bottles from Australia and New Zealand followed in 1981 and Rogers became
the first non-scribe to win an important award for spreading the wine gospel
to the consumer - appropriately enough, from Marques de Caceres, an
innovative rioja producer. And then in 1985 Cullens was taken over.
Since then Rogers has been a consultant for importers Enotria Wines and the
Barnes Wine Shop, has written for Off-Licence News, devised wine courses,
and has been very ill. At one stage he could not even drink but continued to
make wine judgments with confidence using his nose. 'I'm surprised more
people don't taste on the basis of smell alone; it gives the last wine as
fair a chance as the first.' That reflects his philosophy towards both wine
and illness fairly accurately.
But his tastes in wine continue to evolve, as of course does the world's
wine output. 'I have had a love affair with rioja, with New Zealand
Sauvignon, with Australian Chardonnay (I remember a Brown Brothers 1978 that
made me think that the Aussies were going to rule the world), but I have
come back to finesse. You can't beat the French for sheer finesse, just as
you can't beat the mystique attached to their labels.
'I'd love to observe two otherwise identical dinner parties where one lot of
people is told they'll be served a first growth claret, and the other lot
are just given it in a decanter without comment. I bet you'd get two
completely different reactions.' This is typical of someone who cares about
what is inside each bottle rather than its external baggage.
In his wine merchant existence, Rogers may have argued that, compared with
the nose, the eye is virtually redundant. But in the last year or so he has
harnessed his own eyes to a camera to such good effect that an exhibition of
his photographs is being held at Newton's restaurant, 33 Abbeville Road,
London SW4 (081-673-0977). It opened last Monday and all proceeds go to a
fund established by Rogers for those who nurse the terminally ill at St
Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Food and Drink: Bourbon? Take it out of Kentucky - Giles
MacDonogh raises hell in bluegrass country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Were I to play devil's advocate in Louisville, Kentucky - a risky thing to
do - they would almost certainly have me run out of town because I would
suggest two important changes in the way Bourbon whiskey is made.
Firstly, I would abolish the rule that the spirit may only be matured in new
white oak casks. Secondly, I would shift production several hundred miles to
the north, to the Canadian border, a place cool enough to allow the whiskey
to mature in peace.
Bourbon is a prisoner of its own packaging: new white oak, charcoal filters,
and Kentucky. In the last century, and the first few years of this, it was
virtually indistinguishable from 'white dog' or moonshine. This coarse,
backwoodsman's dram was derailed by Prohibition. There was no time between
the repeal of the Volstead Amendment and the outbreak of the second world
war to build up mature stocks of Bourbon which means that the earliest
properly made whiskies were bottled during the second world war or just
after.
I was fortunate enough to sample one of these at United Distillers' big
distillery complex in the suburbs of Louisville.
When Bourbon emerged from its big sleep, it did so with all the gimickry of
new oak and indications of great age. In reality, however, age is not a good
sign when it comes to Bourbon.
The sun burns brightly in the long Kentucky summers and the whiskey is
fairly grilled in the gaunt, corrugated iron silos which are a distinctive
feature of the landscape.
The spirits lodged under the rooftops lose volume at an alarming rate. It
has long been held true that the best Bourbon is the 'middle cut', barrels
housed half-way up the multi-storey warehouse, where they are best protected
from the heat.
As the whiskey reduces in cask it absorbs more and more of the flavours and
tannins in the white oak casks. At around six to eight years it achieves a
sort of balance where it is not too oaky or peppery. When the cask and
whiskey flavours have agreed to some sort of marriage it makes the Bourbon
good to drink. Left for longer it gets forbiddingly peppery and woody.
The 28-year-old Bourbon I sampled at the independent Heaven Hill distillery
was like chewing on a mouthful of splinters. Another drawback, when it comes
to Bourbon, is an obsession with filtering.
If one were to believe the contents of the current advertising campaign for
the Tennessee whiskey, Jack Daniels, the stuff would be so hygienically
filtered that it would be indistinguishable from cask-aged vodka. Filtering
takes the goodness out of all alcoholic drinks. Booker Noe is aware of this
and this is why his very special whiskey - Booker's - is unfiltered.
Booker Noe is the grandson of Jim Beam, one of the distillers who pioneered
the rebirth of Bourbon after Prohibition. Booker was chief distiller at Jim
Beam until recently. Now his son, Fred, is being groomed for the job. Fred
has an agreeable frankness when it comes to Bourbon. As we went through the
distillery I pointed to the heavy filtering process going on before
bottling: 'That's why daddy's so fond of his Bourbon]' he said. The
filtering was introduced in the 1980s. 'The old boys say the whiskey don't
taste like it used to. We don't make it like we used to,' he adds candidly.
Booker Noe is one of Kentucky's living legends; a colossus of a man who
lives in patriarchal style surrounded by his family.
His job is to select the very best whiskies from the Jim Beam distillery
which are issued as single-cask Bourbons. Booker's is issued at cask
strength in very limited quantities and sells in the US at around Dollars 45
(Pounds 30.20) a bottle. It is wonderfully complex for a Bourbon; an
eight-year-old whiskey from the middle of the warehouse with tremendous
depth of flavour Booker also selects the other cask-release Bourbons for Jim
Beam: Basil Hayden, Baker's and Nob Creek.
Jim Beam is not the only Bourbon distillery to issue single-cask Bourbons.
Ancient Age has had a notable success with Blantons and their rare (I was
unable to put my hands on a bottle) Rock Hill Farms label is consistently
cited as one of the best on the market.
None of these single-cask Bourbons is widely available in Britain.
The best you'll find here is a high strength whiskey such as Wild Turkey 101
(50.5 per cent), or Makers Mark from Kentucky's most picturesque (almost
'boutique') distillery in Loretto. The higher strength works better for
Bourbon as the flavours appear to marry up better.
Makers Mark is a Bourbon which uses a small percentage of wheat together
with the predominant corn and malt in its mash tub (another is Rebel Yell).
This may well be responsible for the impressive, lemony length of its taste
on the palate. What is more the flavour of the whiskey seems to win out over
the cask for once; but then, I have probably said enough.
Makers Mark is available from Harrods (071-730-1234) or Selfridges
(071-629-1234) priced around Pounds 21. Harrods also sells the Wild Turkey
101 at Pounds 22.25.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Food and Drink: Distinctly upper crust - Philippa Davenport
samples the foreign flavours on Britain's bread boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain might not be the gastronomic centre of Europe but it scores closer
to the bullseye in one respect than many other EU neighbours - bread.
Eating in hotels and restaurants on the continent, I have been struck by the
omnipresence of side plates laid with cardboard cut-out rolls that bear no
resemblance to real bread. They are lightweight, anaemic, textureless and
tasteless. In Britain, however, any eating establishment with a mite of
pride takes the trouble nowadays to welcome diners with a choice of
increasingly good breads.
Shopping for bread also has become fun and, for variety alone, Britain seems
to have become the bread basket of Europe. Yet, sliced white was the norm
less than 15 years ago; indeed, sliced white was the only bread on offer in
many outlets - a fact so depressing that it prompted Michael Bateman and
Caroline Conran to launch a campaign for real bread in the Sunday Times.
Now, mills are being restored busily, village bakers are bouncing back and
supermarket bakery sections are expanding faster than Chorleywood dough. The
whiff of freshly baked bread wafts from in-store ovens and cash tills are
ringing merrily.
Lincolnshire plum bread, Irish soda bread, Scotch pancakes and barley
bannocks are all selling well but, above all else, the trend is
international. Look along the shelves and you will see loaves with claims to
French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Greek, Armenian, Russian,
Indian and other foreign origins. Every week, newcomers swell the ranks of
this bready tower of Babel. Only yesterday I spotted a label that made me
laugh out loud: 'Mediterranean bread' imported from Canada.
There is a lot of good bread in Britain now and a lot of absurdities. Some
designer breads coming into the shops are a triumph of style over flavour.
Parallel with all of this, interest in home baking is growing apace and two
new books are devoted to the subject. One is The Complete Bread Book, by
Gail Duff (Pavilion Pounds 17.99), sub-titled '150 traditional recipes from
round the world.' Duff is a competent cook, noted for her wholefood and
vegetarian writings.
The other is The Bread Book, by Linda Collister and Antony Blake (Conran
Octopus Pounds 9.99). It is sub-titled 'a step-by step guide to making over
130 delicious breads' and appeals more to me than Duff's, partly because it
does not attempt to cast its net so wide.
Blake is one of those photographers who is so good at illustrating the
written word rather than seeking to dominate it. Collister is an
accomplished baker and totally trustworthy as a recipe writer. She inspires
confidence by virtue of her quiet, unflamboyant style and attention to
detail.
She always mixes and kneads doughs by hand 'because I enjoy it physically.'
She accepts, though, that others may prefer to use a food mixer and a dough
hook. Similarly, although she would always choose fresh yeast, she
acknowledges that others may find dried yeast granules or easy-blend
varieties more convenient. Accordingly, she has tested her recipes using
these sorts of yeasts as well.
Although the majority of breads in this book are raised with yeast,
unleavened breads are included, too. There are also quick breads made with
baking powder (or bicarbonate of soda plus cream of tartar or acidic
liquids) and sourdough breads, the chemistry of which she found particularly
exciting to crack. It is an appetising collection and a very practical guide
to the gentle art of good home baking.
FRENCH SOURDOUGH LOAF
This is Collister's version of the crusty, chewy loaf made popular by the
famous Poilane baking family in Paris. She warns that the tea towel lining
the basket used to mould the loaf must be linen, not terry-cloth, dry and
heavily-floured: if the dough sticks while rising, it can collapse when
inverted onto the baking tray for cooking.
She points out that the first two or three batches will taste good but will
not rise as well or be as successful as later batches when the starter
becomes established. The loaf is an excellent keeper and tastes better as it
matures. It is best sliced thinly and should be eaten within one week.
For the starter: 8 oz stoneground wholemeal bread flour; about 8 fl oz
lukewarm water.
For the sponge: 5 fl oz lukewarm water; 8 oz unbleached white bread flour.
For the dough: 2 fl oz lukewarm water;  3/4 oz sea salt; about 8 oz
unbleached white bread flour; extra flour for dusting.
To make the starter, put the wholemeal flour in a small bowl and make a well
in the centre. Pour in the lukewarm water and mix to make a very thick
batter. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave at room temperature for three
days, re-dampening the towel each day so the batter absorbs the natural
yeasts in the air. After three days, the starter should be smelly, grey and
only slightly bubbly.
To make the sponge, pour the starter into a large mixing bowl. Stir in the
lukewarm water and add the white bread flour. Beat with your hand for about
one minute to make a thick batter. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave at
room temperature for 24-36 hours until it is spongy and slightly bubbly. The
longer you leave the sponge, the more pronounced the taste will be.
To make the dough, stir the sponged batter well. Beat in the remaining water
and the salt, then mix in enough of the remaining white bread flour to make
a soft but not sticky dough.
Turn out the dough on to a lightly-floured work surface and knead for 10
minutes until firm and elastic. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with a
damp tea towel and leave to rise at normal temperature until almost doubled
in size: eight-12 hours.
Knock back the risen dough. Cut off 6-8 oz and set aside for making the next
starter (see below). Shape the rest of the dough into a ball and put it into
a round basket 9 in wide and 4 in deep that has been lined with a dry,
heavily-floured tea towel. (Use a greased 2 lb loaf tin if you prefer, or
place the ball of dough directly onto a baking tray).
Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise at normal to warm room
temperature until almost doubled in size: about eight hours. Subsequent
batches may take less time.
Pre-heat the oven to 220'C/425'F (gas mark 7). Invert the loaf in the basket
onto the baking tray. Using a sharp knife, slash the top of the loaf four
times. Do not drag the knife or the loaf may collapse.
Sprinkle with flour. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to
190'C/375F (gas mark 5) and bake for 35-55 minutes longer until the loaf
sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to
cool completely.
To keep a starter for the next batch, put the reserved 6-8 oz portion of
dough into a greased plastic bag and store in the fridge for up to three
days, or leave the dough in a small bowl covered with a damp tea towel at
normal room temperature for up to two days, re-dampening the towel each day.
To use, start at the sponging stage in the recipe above; you will have to
add a little extra lukewarm water to make a thick batter. Proceed with the
recipe.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Food and Drink: Guide to the food guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Good Food Guide (Which? Books Pounds 14.99), in spite of its editors'
foibles, has served the UK and its readers well, raising standards and
bringing to the judgment of food, wine and service a typically British
approach.
Amateur in the finest sense of the word, it has relied on readers' letters
for restaurant recommendations and has been a commercial success, selling
more than 60,000 copies annually with a small staff and limited expenses.
But the guide needs to respond to changing circumstances. Its faithful
readers are growing older and its younger ones are not in the habit of
sitting down and writing letters after every meal to provide it with the raw
material it relies on. It offers a Freepost service but an easily detachable
fax report form would also be a help.
The Consumers' Association has released Tom Jaine, the editor, from his
contract and spent several months searching - so far unsuccessfully - for a
suitable replacement.
Over lunch of risotto with clams and oxtail en crepinette with pureed
potatoes at Aubergine, London, SW10 (tel: 071-352-3449) Jaine explained why
editing a national guide was becoming increasingly difficult. While
standards had risen sharply in London, and culinary fashions have come and
gone during his five-year tenure, outside the capital a gastronomic vicious
circle prevails.
This was created, Jaine felt, by special event eating. Outside London,
people tend to eat out less frequently and only when the occasion demands -
a birthday, anniversary or wedding. Restaurants have two to three busy days
and nights a week, usually at weekends, and so keep prices high. High prices
stifle demand, people therefore go out less and the circle is perpetuated.
Jaine's gloomy prediction was that in the future only hotels and pubs may
survive outside London. (A recent Gallup survey found that the British
public prefers staying in and watching television to eating out).
The invaluable independence of the Good Food Guide becomes obvious when it
is compared with its competitors. The Egon Ronay Guide sponsored by Cellnet
(Pounds 13.99) is the most comprehensive, thanks it would appear to close
collaboration with the American Express database, but the print is small and
the spine and binding inadequate. The AA Best Restaurants in Britain (Pounds
11.99) is sponsored by Abbey Well water and, although the print is clear,
the maps are surprisingly poor and the decision to list all restaurants
beginning with T together - The Dorchester, The Ivy, The Savoy, but
surprisingly not The Ritz - I found confusing.
The Ackerman Charles Heidsieck Guide (Pounds 14.99) is as effervescent as
one would expect from its association with a champagne house. My main gripe
here is that this guide, while informative, is not at all critical. I also
find photos of empty restaurants off-putting - one good reason for staying
in and watching television.
There are even more guides to London restaurants this year. Harden's (Pounds
6.95) remains the most concise, up-to-date (complete with a list of
restaurant closures) and most user-friendly in terms of format and price.
Its ratings for food, service and ambience, however, have become too
restrictive.
The first edition of the Evening Standard London Restaurant Guide (Pounds
9.99) is disappointing. Although it benefits from two authoritative,
incisive writers, Fay Maschler on food and Andrew Jefford on wine, and has
the clout of a big organisation behind it, I was left with two nagging
questions. Why did it cost 50 per cent more than the other two London guides
and why does it have to have such a smelly plastic cover?
This year I have overcome two major reservations against the Time Out Guide
(Pounds 6.99) and use it more than any other London guide. Its cover too is
awful - as is the Good Food Guide - and its A4 size is inconvenient. But it
is comprehensive, including a down-to-earth account of a meal in London's
only Burmese restaurant, Maymyo in Herne Hill, and its area index, with
restaurants listed by area and then by cuisine, is highly practical. Most of
all, I appreciated its breakdown of London restaurants by cuisine. It made
me realise that if one is tired of eating out in London one is tired of
eating out.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Motoring: Pedal policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention of pedal cycles in a motoring column is guaranteed to produce a
reaction. Even if pro-bike, motorists complain - justifiably - about a
minority of cyclists who behave disgracefully. They cite riding on
pavements; foul language or threats of violence to pedestrians who protest;
ignoring traffic signals and one-way streets; and riding unlit at night.
Cyclists, also justifiably, complain that some drivers behave thoughtlessly,
even aggressively toward them as though they had no right to be on the road
at all. The fact is that cyclists have a perfect right to use highways (but
not motorways) freely, although whether they are always wise to exercise
this right is open to question. But they also have responsibilities.
Insurance is a prime example. Few cyclists have any, yet a third of the
20,000-odd accidents involving them each year are held to be their fault. In
law, they could be responsible for dam-age and injury, even legal fees.
This Christmas, about 1m children will wobble forth on their new bikes.
Many, thankfully, will wear safety helmets. But even more important would be
a RiderBike* policy (Pounds 12 a year for an individual, Pounds 20 for the
family) bought with the bike from independent cycle dealers.
Last year, 24,800 cyclists became road casualties in Britain, 3,787 with
serious injuries. Of 204 who died, 48 were children. While insurance cannot
prevent accidents, it can at least make the results of many of them less
distressing.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Sport: Very wet, very cold and very fast - Yachting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Icebergs, dense fog, speeds suitable for waterskiing, and boat damage are
now daily fare for the yachts competing in the Whitbread round the world
race. This weekend the fleet will pass King Edward Island, 1,000 miles
south-east of Cape Town and the half-way point of the second leg.
Intrum Justitia, the pan-European entry in the lightweight W60 class, is the
yacht setting the pace - literally. On Wednesday, it posted a new Omega
24-Hour Challenge record for the 1993/4 race with a run of 376.6 miles. At
one point in the day, the satellite results system showed Intrum holding a
steady 22 knots. But the depression blasting it along weakened and the
average speed dropped to a tamer 17 knots.
Spray reached as high as the first spreaders on the mast, reported skipper
Lawrie Smith, and the on-watch crew faced walls of green water coming down
the deck. Much of it found its way below.
'These boats are notoriously wet, more akin to a submarine on the point of a
dive than the surfing sailboards they've been described as,' said Smith.
'Everything is dripping down below. Floors, walls, clothes. Only the bunks
are dry and I'm not too optimistic about them. It's horrible - but you can
put up with it if you're winning,' grinned Smith on a live video link via
Inmarsat.
Aged 37, and Britain's top professional sailor, he has transformed the
fortunes of Intrum Justitia since replacing Roger Nilson as skipper after
leg one. The boat led across the start line out of Punta del Este, in
Uruguay, two weeks ago and has stayed in pole position (in the W60 class)
since.
Sceptics in rival yachts refused to believe that changing one man could
alter the fortunes of a highly technical campaign. Alan Gray might beg to
differ.
Gray's yacht, Jamarella, made a middling start in the 1989 Admiral's Cup
campaign so he brought in Smith and the boat finished top AC yacht for the
season. 'He's simply an excellent sailor and makes a big difference when he
joins,' said Gray. 'It's motivation and experience, not just ability. Lawrie
has grit and a bit of magic, plus huge technical ability to optimise things
like sails. You can't quantify attitude but, if we were talking about the
media or show business, you'd know he has star quality.'
Ross Field, skipper of the fourth-placed Yamaha, 74 miles behind Smith, does
not seem to be enjoying himself quite so much. 'Conditions are bloody
unpleasant. It's very cold and the snow and fog are making it even more
difficult,' he said. 'We've spotted icebergs and this snow is ahead of a new
front coming through.'
Yamaha was lucky to escape undamaged after being knocked flat in the 'big
blow' that powered Intrum to its record run. Field said the broach happened
in around 35 knots of wind and the yacht was on its side for nearly 15
minutes.
'We had the spinnaker up and were sitting at a steady 25 knots' boat speed
without surfing. We broached and it was bloody terrifying. The crew were all
clipped on, so there were no injuries, but we were all a little shaken.'
After the experience of Tokio in the early days of this leg, there will
scarcely be a Whitbread crewmember who is not wearing his safety harness.
Tokio, which won the W60 class in the first leg of the race and is second
around 20 miles behind Intrum Justitia, lost bowman Ken Hara overboard when
he fell from the tip of the spinnaker pole without a safety line.
Skipper Chris Dickson said: 'When we spotted Ken in the water, we were doing
13 knots away from him with two spinnakers up and a lot of work to do before
we could turn the boat around. Hara's first thoughts on seeing the boat
going away from him were: 'This must be a dream, this can't be happening.'
He removed his boots and held them upside down for additional buoyancy. He
was wearing only seaboots and thermal underwear at the time.
'This incident was not due to extreme conditions but through carelessness.
All the crew is aware that, in different conditions and darkness, things
might not have gone so smoothly,' added Dickson, who reprimanded Hara. The
bowman is a hero in Japan, where he is the country's first big-time
professional sailor in a nation that is gripped increasingly by yacht
racing.
The jury is still out on the question of whether the bigger 80ft
maxi-ketches can hold off the challenge of the W60s on this 7,500-mile leg
to Western Australia. The smaller yachts need consistent winds of more than
30 knots to break through but, so far, they have had only random 12-hour
spells of heavy air. Nevertheless, Intrum Justitia has passed Merit Cup, the
second-placed maxi, and has only New Zealand Endeavour 50 miles or so ahead.
Pierre Fehlmann, skipper of Merit Cup, is candid in his anxieties about his
yacht's inability to match the Kiwis despite having near-identical boats
from the same designer. 'I am really wondering, do they have a hull that is
somewhat better in surfing conditions? Do they simply have better helmsmen?
Or do they push the boat one step further towards the risk limit than we
do?' pondered a downcast Fehlmann.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Sport: Power but not enough glory - Rugby Union / Under
Dudley Wood England has grown rich. He tells Derek Wyatt his plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Dudley Wood is a big lad. He needs to be. As secretary of the Rugby Football
Union, he sits on a rugby throne whose power and wealth has swelled in the
seven years that he has occupied it. Since 1986, the Rugby Union's business
has grown from Pounds 5m to nearer Pounds 45m; the staff from 50 to more
than 100. It owned the Twickenham ground, an assortment of allotments,
better known as car parks, and 26 houses nearby, now it has a rebuilt
stadium and a second ground complete with hotel in Wolverhampton. You have
to pinch yourself to remember that all this has happened while the economy
has been in reverse.
This increased financial strength has made England the dominant nation in
the talking-shop which some refer to as the Four Home Unions committee. But
on the field progress has stalled. The All Blacks triumphal progress round
Britain suggests that this afternoon's international will provide another
demonstration of the gap between England and the top nations in the southern
hemisphere. Wood is using his muscle to persuade the other home unions to
accept changes which serve England's aspirations rather than their own
interests. Wood plans changes to club rugby in Europe, in the way tours are
handled and in the five nations championship and the distribution of the
television revenue it generates.
'In future we will be looking to develop a Test series against an incoming
country like Australia. I suspect this would be two Tests. it would be nice
to think that we could hold one in the north and one at Twickenham. We had
the South Africans at Elland Road (Leeds United's ground) last year and this
year the crowds at Anfield (in Liverpool) and Gateshead for the New
Zealanders suggest there is a large audience for our game,' said Wood.
The reality is that with Pounds 28m raised to complete the north and east
stands at Twickenham - the latter is opened today - and the west stand due
for rebuilding starting in May,a two Test series would have to be played
entirely at Twickenham in the immediate future to maximise income.
Whether English rugby remains fashionable depends on how the team fares in
the world cup, due to be held in South Africa in 12 games', or 19 months',
time. Certainly, England's club structure, though heaving under the strain
of home and away Courage league fixtures, is vibrant and the envy of all,
save the French.
The Welsh, whose domestic league is sponsored by Heineken beer, want to
improve competition for their top clubs and have urged the creation an
Anglo-Welsh league. Woods said: 'There is no urgency to establish an
Anglo-Welsh league. The home and away fixtures must stay for one more
season, so we can best see how to adjust the numbers in the top three
divisions. There's no flexibility at present and if we had a bad winter I'm
not sure how we would fit in those matches cancelled.
'The four English clubs who met their Welsh counterparts the other day did
telephone me to tell me what they were doing. Of course, we understand that
these fixtures were and are important to them and add extra spice and
revenue. It is probably true too that at the moment the Welsh clubs need the
English clubs more than we need them. We have sponsorship deals to honour -
in Courage's case we've another three and a half seasons to go - and we
won't be dictated to by other sponsors.
'Adding more to the time-table would impact on the Five Nations which we
have been trying to push back towards the end of the season but we cannot
convince the French who do not wish to move their club competition. I'm not
sure we can expand it either. Romania is not the strength it was and our B
team has comprehensively beaten Italy and Spain so they must wait. America
is struggling and only Canada would be worth considering and two leagues of
five probably wouldn't work.'
The Five Nations Championships is the envy of all other sports. No-one in
their right minds would tamper with it, except . . . except . . . the
tournament is not serving the aspirations of French or English rugby.
The quality of the play in the five nations has fallen. The standards set by
Australia in the Parc des Princes three weeks ago against France and the
power of the All Blacks showed last Saturday against an embarrassingly weak
Scotland team, showed that it has become too inward looking.
While New Zealand has its sights on the World Cup in 1995, England has its
sights on the Five Nations and the World Cup. To some extent the Five
Nations is now an irritant in the preparation of the squad. Yet, it is the
proverbial jewel in the crown where television is concerned even though the
existing contracts are confused.
In France, the broadcaster Antenne 2 owns the rights for France's
championship home games until 1995. The BBC owns the rights to games in the
UK until 1994. Another UK broadcaster - Sky or ITV - could buy the rights to
the French games from Antenne 2 and put any new UK deal in jeopardy.
Ireland's state broadcaster RTE could do a similar deal. There is nothing to
stop them.
The Four Home Unions television sub-committee has not kept abreast of
developments in the European media and is still trying to formulate a
contract to put out to tender. Wood conceded as much: 'It has been a tricky
series of negotiations between the four home unions and about what we want
to put in the tender. We are aware of the holes that exist.'
In the past the four home unions have divided the cake into equal parts and
though Wood would not commit himself it is apparent that this will no longer
be the case. England, with the largest rugby population, will receive more
than the others, possibly as much as 40 per cent of the total.
The senior clubs, who want to negotiate their own television contract, shot
themselves in the foot a few weeks back. Racing at Ascot was called off and
BBC television offered to take the second half of the Wasps v Bath game live
for Pounds 15,000. The senior clubs refused, fearing it would harm their
gates that afternoon. Televising it would have given them some idea of the
pull of the leagues and some reaction from their sponsors.
It is sometimes easy to forget that all these developments have come about
because of the 15 England players who will try to stem the All Black tide
this afternoon. It is they who have created the increasing demand for the
game. Their development is being held up by the parochialism of the home
unions. If they had their way, I believe, they would want England to plot
its own future independent of the other three home countries.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Fashion: To hell with colour - black is back / Brenda Polan
dresses down - deliciously - in every woman's favourite fashion classic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It was the kind of party which, a year ago, would have been a raucous
festival of colour: bright satin, aggressive taffeta, dazzling lame. It
would have been cheerful with feathers, beads, diamante buttons and
flamboyant bows. This year, however, the room was a haven of sombre
sobriety. It was difficult, on first entering, to distinguish the black-clad
men from the black-clad women. Only the flashes of female flesh, the bare
arms, shoulders and nearly-bare bosoms which glowed under the dimmed lights,
offered a few clues.
This sea of darkness elicited a strangely mixed response: disappointment
that the eye-stimulation offered by a rich variety of colour and texture was
missing; and a relaxing sense of familiarity and safety. This, after all,
was just the way it was in the mid and early 1980s before designers
'rediscovered' colour.
Those, of course, were the days when most of us wore little else but black
at any time of the day, a phenomenon jointly induced by the Milanese
designers with their passion for an urban uniform of black, white and grey
and the new wave of Japanese designers with their bag-lady, post-holocaust
monochrome palette.
Fashion victims of the time would confess to having inadvertently bought the
same black jacket twice, to having another eight similar ones in their
wardrobes and to being made nervous by the sight of anyone wearing something
colourful. Men and mothers got very depressed at what they perceived as a
morose and deliberately disfiguring uniform.
For, in our culture, black clothing carries deep-seated associations of loss
and self-denial, mourning, guilt, gloom, sorrow, sin and death. It is the
non-colour worn by nuns and widows, celibate priests, ascetic scholars,
avenging goddesses and cauldron-peering witches, by the Furies, Hamlet,
Queen Victoria - and Dracula.
So whenever it is worn by someone who falls into none of those categories,
it has, traditionally, a perverse, dramatic effect. Beau Brummell's falling
out with the Prince Regent may have degenerated into name-calling but it
began as a clash of styles when Brummell discovered he was bored with
jewel-coloured brocades and embroidered velvets and got himself up in sober
black, relieved only by a simple white stock.
The entrance he consequently made has, as he might have wished, reverberated
through history. It was the start of an unstoppable revolution in men's
clothing and the Prince's subsequent temper tantrum only made it more
likely.
On women, particularly young women, the dramatic effect is further
heightened. Traditionally, as the debutantes presented at Queen Charlotte's
Ball can testify, white and its pastel near-neighbours are the appropriate
colours for maidens. White is the colour of purity and innocence, simplicity
and hope. Black, its opposite, manages to imply impurity, experience,
sophistication and, if not cynicism, then knowingness.
It was only in the early years of the century that it became permissible for
a woman to wear black for evening glamour rather than because she was in
mourning - and even then, if she was not an actress, she had better be
married.
This was a proviso which operated even when Coco Chanel introduced the first
official Little Black Dress in 1923. It was very much a grown-up's dress, a
dress worn by a woman of the world with a long sautoir of pearls and a
cigarette in a holder.
So much of recent fashion history is a matter of Chanel inventing and Yves
Saint Laurent revising that it is hardly surprising that, the LBD having
been reworked by every couturier in between, it was young Yves who gave it
new life in the shape of the Smoking, a dress which mimicked the lines and
satin revers of the gentleman's tuxedo.
Simultaneously the last of the exclusion clauses became inoperative. The
self-dramatisation of Beatnik black had deliberately set out to undermine
all kinds of conventional ideas about dress. The young women of the 1960s
loved it for its moodiness, its hint of threat and danger, the fact that it
shocked their mothers. They embraced Saint Laurent's Beat leathers and black
Smoking with equal passion.
However, shock value is easily attenuated by familiarity. In the last 30
years the LBD has become a staple of most women's wardrobes not because of
its drama but because of its lack of it.
It is the equivalent of the man's evening suit. In it, a woman feels secure
in the knowledge that she is appropriately dressed. She will never look as
if she has tried too hard - much worse than looking as if she hasn't tried
at all. Unless the LBD in question is particularly extravagant in style, she
will never look dated and, more important, she will never look like mutton
dressed as lamb, a serious hazard when fashions in eveningwear become
glitzy, colourful and overtrimmed.
So, at last week's party, among the LBDs, the Smokings, the black palazzo
pyjama suits, the black all-in-ones and the black velvet Biba knock-offs,
regret and disappointment were fleeting. Gratitude and relief will last a
lot longer.
My escort, an amateur sociologist given to sweeping interpretations of
fairly frivolous trends, observed portentously: 'Ah hah, sackcloth and
ashes. The eighties are really over. They've all gone into mourning for
their Chanel handbags. It's nineties self-denial.'
No, no. It's nineties ease and comfort. You can only sustain high anxiety
for short stretches of time and that is exactly what getting into a party
dress used to be like. Me? I was wearing a black trouser suit over a black
lace body. Wouldn't you have been?

FT  27 NOV 93 / Fashion: Belgian chic - from riches to rags / Does anyone
actually wear the deconstructionists' designs? / A look at the clothes on
the catwalks, below, and, right, on some real-life customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most interesting and challenging clothes right now come from a man who
makes jackets out of old Metro posters and a woman whose idea of decoration
is hospital-style tape ties. This sounds like the same avant-garde
freakiness that spawned fashion-victim long black layers, impossible to wear
for anyone other than scrawny superwaifs, but the growing band of
sophisticated women who love these clothes tell a different story.
Ann Demeulemeester, Martin Margiela and Dries van Noten are the
tongue-twisting Belgian triumvirate leading the 'deconstruction' movement
which turns the traditional precepts of clothes-making literally inside out,
putting lining fabrics, raw edges, seams and so on on the outside.
These are controversial ideas that originally made a strong point about
consumerist fashion in recessionary times but, as the threesome insists,
such ideas are only a tiny part of their output.
The designers are the direct descendants of the older avant-garde grouping
of Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake, who have long toyed with
such themes. But whereas the Japanese looked to their own culture and the
future for their uncompromising shapes, the Belgians are infused with a
powerful nostalgia for Europe's fashion past.
The Belgians graduated from art school in Antwerp in the mid-1980s. They
share a philosophy which then seemed revolutionary, that clothes should be a
quiet mix of individual pieces, new and old, to enhance the personality.
With brash, gilt-buttoned logoland all around them, they needed shock
tactics to get noticed.
Hence Margiela's anarchic shows in derelict hospitals and car parks
featuring plastic-bag dresses bound round with Sellotape, or waiter's aprons
worn with thigh-high waders, Demeulemeester's overlong sleeves and tape-ties
looking suspiciously like ideas from straitjackets or hospital robes, and
van Noten's retreat into institutional-looking baggy grey or beige linen.
Now that fashion has undergone a sea-change and recycling, plain clothes and
tiny details are desirable, they find themselves in the vanguard and they
have softened their position. Far from clothing women in ugly black layers,
they say, they want them to look their natural best. The result in their
spring collections, and those from kindred spirits such as Martine Sitbon
and Helmut Lang, is a delicate, lyrical freshness that makes the efforts of
better-known designers to follow the same lines look like the bumbling of
clumsy dinosaurs.
These Belgians are far from the snarling nihilists some of their publicity
suggests. Margiela is a charming, gentle giant whose chunky marled sweater
and sea dog's cap make him look more like a North Sea fisherman than a
designer. He finds beauty both in precious old clothes and the ability to
remodel them in modern form.
His ideas tread a fine line between the witty and the wacky, usually coming
down on the right side because of their quality. The soft, chunky Aran-style
sweater shrouded in a layer of fine net, the clingy crop-top apparently made
from a pair of long socks, the antique-looking crepe dress with its darts
and hem carefully unpicked and pressed open (yet still flatteringly cut),
the man-styled jacket cut with a narrow shoulderline and overlong sleeves to
emphasise femininity - the list seems endless.
Margiela's influence on current fashion is eloquently displayed by his
spring collection. There is not a single new piece, just his favourites from
previous collections, all coloured grey and carefully dated with their year
of design. There they all are - the apron skirt, the flesh-coloured chiffon
body with tattoo print, even the recycled paper jacket, all invented here
but seen on many international catwalks for the first time this season.
Sheila Cunningham, a 60-year-old East End social worker and one-time
assistant to New York fashion doyenne Diana Vreel, is one of his fans. 'His
clothes are a private pleasure. They don't cry out 'designer' and could be
second-hand but they are well-made and feel wonderful. Dark colours are good
for work and public transport. The shapes are individual enough to transcend
trends. I buy such things in sales and need them to last.'
Ann Demeulemeester, a small, pale blonde with limpid blue eyes, is a
perfectionist whose business is self-financed and controlled. She says she
'only started designing when I felt I had something different to say, to put
my soul into clothes. Mainstream fashion was about comedy then but I was
trying to design poetry.'
Her clothes are detailed with craft-like care. Tiny ties that bind and
fasten, fine tucks in the back of a swirling soft dress that give it a
flattering sensuousness, the femininity of a bias-cut velvet skirt under a
narrow, but mannish, brocade frockcoat - wearing these clothes is a subtle
pleasure.
Her spring look is soft and fragile, with tiny linen camisoles suspended
over mesh tops and hitched-up Victorian skirts, and pale, delicate colours
replacing some of the black. 'I wanted to dispel the idea that my clothes
are sad,' she says, 'though sadness is a fine emotion.'
Dries van Noten, who looks as beautiful and delicate as his printed
chiffons, is the most accessible of the three in design terms. Always more
inclined to use colour, he likes fragile, ethnic fabrics, antique embroidery
and beading which he mixes with plain textures. His spring collection of
nostalgic chiffon lingerie dresses, softly rose-printed overblouses and
double chiffon reversible skirts is one of the season's prettiest.
The clients' comments show the appeal of these clothes to be their subtle
detail and unshowy luxury. This is because they are cleverly designed and
well made from the best fabrics. There is an idea that the deconstructed
look can be achieved by chopping up, rebuilding and leaving raw edges on any
old undersized, overwashed 1970s leftovers. If you do that you will just
look as if you are wearing - well - chopped-up 1970s leftovers. To look
elegant and believable, even deconstruction must be handled by artists and
experts.
A selection of the Belgian designers work can be seen at the following
shops: A la Mode, Hans Crescent, London SW1; Browns, South Molton Street,
W1; Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, SW1; Joans, Floral Street, WC2; Joseph,
Brompton Cross, SW3; Pollyanna of Barnsley; Warehouse of Glasgow and
Whistles, St Christopher's Place, W1 and branches.

FT  27 NOV 93 / As They Say in Europe: Italy's messy road to liberation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSIS of the Italian political scene no longer consists of 'Porn star in
poll victory shock.' The shocks of last Sunday's vote demand greater skills
than that; but not much more in my case, for I believe it was all the fault
of the Americans. More of that later.
There was some cogent analysis among top Italian commentators, notably
Norberto Bobbio in the Turin daily, La Stampa. He noted, pessimistically, in
his pre-election forecasts that tradition was unpromising: 'The history of
united Italy is constituted by a succession, not of governments and
oppositions which have alternated, but of regimes whose successor has made a
tabula rasa of its predecessor.'
Each regime had wiped out what the former government had done and, since the
second world war, there had been a single government - one of the centre.
Today, though, there no longer was a centre.
Perhaps, Bobbio concluded hopefully, Italy would now join 'the main highway
of great democracies.' There would be a left and a right and both would be
dragged towards the middle. This image of a vacuum where the centre parties
used to be, and which would suck others into it, dominates the minds of
Italians. The Vatican's Osservatore Romano alone was agnostic: 'The centre
represents purely and simply a point of convergence of the extremes.'
The Italian desire to impose physical laws on its failed system was not
shared elsewhere. In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, our old friend
Johann-Georg Reissmuller decided that 'government standstill could follow
bad government.' But what upset him, as a man of the right, was the prospect
of a communist revival.
He said that although the Communist party had not benefited from Italian
corruption, it had received Soviet subsidies and its leaders had climbed the
political ladder when the party was still loyal to Moscow. 'How can it be
that broad strata could expect the political and moral regeneration of the
state from such people?'
Why not? The political and moral regeneration of Germany after 1945 occurred
with the active participation of many who were infinitely nastier than
anything the Italian Communist party might produce.
In fact, the post-communist Party of the Democratic Left in Italy, which
rejected the tutelage of the USSR long before its opponents rejected the
embrace of organised crime, has a fair claim to join in any programme of
political reconstruction. It has, after all, a good record in local
government, partly because it could not participate fully in the system of
bribes and kickbacks that is responsible for the present crisis.
Anyway, Italy is not the only place where there is a revival of communists
without any revival of communism. The implacable realities of post-communism
have led to people looking again to representatives of a discredited system
in those countries where a communist party has exercised power. It is not
necessarily a worrying trend; almost everywhere, top former communists have
done too well out of capitalism to start thinking about wrecking it.
The success of the MSI is not part of what might seem to be a parallel
phenomenon - the revival of fascism in countries with a communist past. The
MSI got a lot of votes partly because it was not anything else. But here we
come to the nub of problem: Sunday's vote was, in fact, an anachronistic
revolt against history.
Some months ago, I wrote that Italians do not blame outsiders for their
problems. I was wrong, for those with long memories do. Perhaps one of the
reasons for the success of the neo-fascist MSI was that it, too, was not
only outside the corrupt network of organised crime and political cronyism
but it also has anti-Mafia credentials.
The predecessors of both the communists and the MSI, obviously, were targets
of American hostility. In 1943, Washington made a deal with the Sicilian
gangster, Lucky Luciano, to facilitate the Allied landings in Sicily, and
the Mafia regained its position - as part of the coalition against Mussolini
who had almost wiped it out.
It prospered in that odd triangle of power constituted by the Christian
Democrats, Washington and the Catholic church. Each had its own reason for
tolerating the Mafia. Neither the Communist party nor the MSI played any
part in the evolution of the system which the Americans brought into being
in 1944 when the Allies entered Rome. So, while the other pillars of the
system collapse, the Mafia will, perhaps, be put back into the bottle from
which Washington released it.
In Sicily itself, 75 percent of the electorate voted against the Mafia.
Curious, is it not? Washington's one-time partner in Sicily faces popular
rejection while its enemies on the mainland have triumphed over its cold war
friends. As Bobbio said, any change in Italy wipes out the immediate past.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A repelling secret - Clive Fewins
meets Rufus Stone, soldier, sailor, policeman, engineer, surveyor, salesman
and potion mixer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rufus Stone is unlikely to forget the day he received an early-morning phone
call from a tea planter in Assam. Wild elephants were using the timbers
supporting his main tea-grading shed as scratching posts. One building had
already collapsed and his staff feared for their lives.
The caller had heard of a magic potion called Curb that would repel the
intruders if sprayed on the buildings. Could Rufus send some some urgently?
The carefully-contrived cocktail was urgently despatched, and proved
effective. The elephants went.
Stone's company, Sphere Laboratories (London), has dealt with tigers in
Malaysia, gerbils in Israeli desert settlements, pigeons in Trafalgar
Square, moles in parks and sports grounds, and, recently, football pitch
invasions for Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers. Both clubs'
newly-laid turf were being damaged by birds.
Lt Colonel Rufus Stone RE has done many things. He was born 81 years ago on
a farm in mid-Devon and has worked as a seaman, an inspector in the
Metropolitan Police and a regular soldier. During the war he worked on the
Mulberry Harbour off the coast of Normandy during and after the D-Day
landings in 1944.
He has no formal training but has worked as an agricultural feedstuff
salesman, an engineering designer, a consulting engineer and a surveyor.
From 1959-63 he worked for the Cyanamid Corporation as UK general manager
and then as European director of the agricultural, foodstuffs and veterinary
division.
Soon after he was made redundant by Cyanamid at 51, a chance meeting in a
London pub led to a request for him to tackle the problem of horses
*something in here (HP) *
chewing the woodwork in their stables at a racing stud.
'I had always been passionately fond of animals, but from my experience in
the veterinary and agro-pharmaceutical field I had also developed a pretty
good idea of what substances they found repellant,' said Stone, who runs the
one-man business from his 16th-century cottage in the village of Chilton on
the Berkshire Downs.
'I did a bit of ringing round and experimented with a substance I concocted,
based on aluminium ammonium sulphate. It was a powder mixed with water that
I painted on the looseboxes. After a bit of experimentation I managed to
find a formulation that worked.
'I had a hunch that I was on to something big, so in 1967 I took out
patents, and registered the main product under the name Curb.
'Then, without doing any formal marketing - all I did was some phoning round
 -I managed to interest a host of important people in the agricultural and
horticultural world. Some people in the field of domestic animal repellants
heard about Curb and were attracted by the powder form.
'I soon realised that Curb would stop pigs from tailbiting, birds from
pecking crops, dogs from fouling footpaths and rats from jumping on poultry
and killing their victims.'
Soon he was selling Curb to seed companies, local authorities, government
departments, and export agents.
'All sorts of big companies buy it from me and sell it under a variety of
fancy names. It also sells under different names in France, Germany, Italy,
Austria and in the East,' Stone said.
The patents cost Stone Pounds 7,500 and covered 25 countries, but they
proved to be the wisest move he made.
'I raised Pounds 15,000 from a loan company - the only money I have ever
borrowed - to help me develop the enterprise at this important stage and you
could say the sphere was really rolling,' he said.
Sphere has been rolling productively - and profitably - ever since. Stone
can be seen at all hours mixing his secret potion in the 2,000 sq ft
industrial unit - a former wartime explosives and mixing store at Milton
Park near Abingdon that he has rented since 1970.
'It is only four miles from my house so I just drive down and mix to order.
If there is a rush I have a few part-time helpers I can call upon.
'Annual production is about 50 tons and at Pounds 2,000 a ton that means I
turn over about Pounds 100,000. Profit runs at 20-25 per cent of turnover
and my main overheads are materials at about Pounds 20,000 a year and my
annual rent, which is Pounds 12,000.'
But after 30 years of making and selling Curb doesn't he want to do
something new?
'I find it so interesting that I never want to retire. My father was playing
golf to a 16 handicap at 86, although I have given up riding and shooting I
should like to develop the company further,' Stone said.
'I find the calls I get and the problems to be solved immensely fascinating.
I have given papers at scientific meetings in the USA and Europe, and I meet
all sorts of interesting people on my troubleshooting trips in this country.
'A few months ago I had phone calls from Sweden and Eire on the same day.
Both callers rang to tell me they had discovered Curb will stop birds
pecking putty out of window frames. Soon after the big putty manufacturers
got on to me. Now I sell to them, and so it goes on.'
There are two more things Stone wants to do. The first is to make his
stepsons, Sean and Simon, who he hopes will take over the business, fully
conversant with Curb's secret formula. The second is to develop neem oil, a
natural extract from India.
'The insect-repellant qualities of this substance have been known to mankind
since 500 years before Christ, but it has yet to be exploited to its full
potential,' he said.
'It will repel, and if necessary kill, just about every type of insect known
to man. The Americans are now growing it and say it is going to be very big
in harmless insect control over the next 100 years. Some experts say it has
a part to play in preventing the spread of HIV, while it can also be used to
repel organisms that cause barnacles to form on the outside of ships.
'I am keen for the British to exploit neem oil. All I need is to find
somebody with a few million to put into it.'

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: GA reforms endowments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The life insurance industry is starting to respond to criticism of the poor
value received by customers who surrender their endowment policies in the
early years. General Accident Life is introducing a new endowment policy
which guarantees that the surrender value in the early years will be equal
to all the premiums paid. There are some conditions, however.
The guaranteed payout applies only in cases of financial hardship - for
example, if the borrower defaults because of redundancy, marital breakdown
or sickness. And the company will pay only the surrender value to the
mortgage lender. But at least borrowers will owe less than they might
otherwise have done.
While this change is undoubtedly an improvement, it deals with only part of
the problem of the inflexibility of endowments. Many people who are not in
financial hardship may want to surrender their policies because of a change
in their circumstances.
The good news is that the GA policy will also offer enhanced values to those
who surrender for any reason in the first few years. It estimates, for
example, that payouts for those who surrender after year three will improve
by 60 per cent.
GA Life will achieve this change by spreading the costs of setting up the
policy over five years instead of the first two, as was the case previously.
As a result, intermediaries who recommend the product will be paid on a
'level commission' basis through the life of the policy, rather than
receiving most of it upfront as is usually the case.
This obviously creates a cash-flow problem for financial advisers. Some
believe that when, under proposed new disclosure rules, they have to reveal
the amount of commission they receive, consumer pressure will force the
industry to move to a level commission basis.
GA Life will continue to offer its old-style endowment policy, which pays
commission upfront, alongside the new version. In its press release, the
company says it 'anticipates that IFAs (independent financial advisers) will
make the decision based on the right product for the individual
circumstances of the client.'
The whole issue brings us back, however, to one of the basic problems of the
commission system. The new policy will result in the same terminal payout as
the old; indeed, the only difference for the policyholder will be the
enhanced value in the early years.
Thus, it is hard to imagine any circumstances when it would be in the best
interest of the client to have the old policy; the best interests of the
adviser are another matter.
If all products were sold on a level commission basis, these conflicts of
interest would not occur. But while the systems run in tandem, there are
likely to be problems.
Nevertheless, any attempts by the life industry to reform itself must be
welcomed. Present regulatory plans, which will involve customers being given
full details of surrender values as well as commission payments, ought to
mean that those consumers who do want endowment policies will be buying with
their eyes open.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A matter of choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I own our house in equal shares as tenants-in-common. To reduce
inheritance tax, we intend to leave our half shares to our son. But would it
not be wiser to leave him 9/10ths of our half share so that the survivor
with 11/20ths would have full control over the property?
An individual who owns a share of property as tenant-in-common is able to
leave the whole or part of his share in the property to whoever he wishes.
It is possible, therefore, that you could in your will leave 9/10ths of your
share to your son and 1/10th to your spouse. Your spouse would then have an
11/20ths share in the property, but this does not mean that she would have
'full control' of it.
Both your son and widow, as tenants-in-common, have an undivided share in
the whole property, which means that the person with the smaller interest
can still enjoy the whole of the property.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: No shocks, please, we're careful -
Unit trusts / Pembroke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pembroke does not rank alongside the better known names of the unit trust
industry, such as M&amp;G or Fidelity, but it is the second highest-performing
fund in the UK Equity Growth sector in the five and three years to November
1 (offer to bid, net income re-invested, Source: Micropal).
The fund was established in December 1986 as a joint venture between John
Carrington &amp; Co., a London-based independent fund management company
established in 1970, and a Cardiff stockbroker. Carrington took over total
ownership in December 1988.
Once it acquired a five-year track record, Pembroke caught the eye of
independent financial advisers, who recommended it to clients. As a result,
it has grown from Pounds 5m last year to just under Pounds 14m at
end-October. The price is still only weekly but there are plans to go daily
in the new year. Also, the name is to be changed soon to Pembroke Growth
following the recent acquisition by Carrington of two Brown Shipley unit
trusts.
Pembroke is managed by a trio: John Carrington, a former financial
journalist with The Times; George Luckraft, who joined the company in 1980
from university; and Nigel Thomas, formerly an accountant with Robson Rhodes
and one-time manager of Hill Samuel's Smaller Companies fund.
The team's strategy relies heavily on stock selection and Thomas, as
investment manager, has veto power over selection. 'We look for value in
terms of cash flow per share, dividend cover, yield, earnings growth, and
the growth relative to the price/earnings ratio,' he says. 'If we don't find
it in the FT-SE stocks, then we look elsewhere.'
He cites Sirdar, one of the top 10 holdings, as a classic example of looking
for value in a declining industry. Sirdar, which deals in textiles and
hand-knitting yarns, was bought on a 9 per cent dividend yield. Boosted by
new management, the company has increased its dividend while the shares are
yielding 5 per cent.
Thomas adds: 'We are, hopefully, picking the best of the Footsie like Cable
&amp; Wireless, De La Rue and Wolseley, and then giving it a good blend of
medium and smaller size companies that are growing irrespective of the
economy.' His aim is companies growing by 10-20 per cent a year.
About 58 per cent of the fund is split evenly between large and medium sized
companies. Four per cent is in cash and the rest in smaller companies.
'We're not a slave to sectoral weightings,' says Thomas. 'If we don't like
oil companies, which are 9 per cent of the All Share, we don't have them.'
The team has a predilection for companies 'which make things or sell things'
so that it tends to ignore oil, some financials and property.
There are certainly no financial or property companies in the fund's top
five holdings: Electronic Data Processing, a Sheffield-based computer
software and services group; Mayborn Group, which makes fabric dyes, baby
products and florists' sundries; Cable &amp; Wireless; Filofax, the personal
organiser company; and Next, the fashion retailer. EDP, the largest holding,
accounts for 2.4 per cent of the fund but holdings usually are limited to 2
per cent.
The team finds smaller companies through its network of specialist small
company brokers and its own experience. Luckraft and Thomas both have small
children and noticed that many of the products they bought for them came
from Mayborn - which is now the fund's second-largest holding.
Luckraft says Pembroke's performance has resulted from avoiding disasters -
largely, by taking the view that, where smaller companies are concerned,
investing is like lending money to the management. With three people
involved, the team also has the time to meet the managements of the fund's
smaller companies. 'We operate a management ban list and we will not touch
some managements wherever they turn up,' he says.
Thomas adds that performance is aided by a readiness to sell stocks which
are not performing as well as expected. 'If something makes a loss for a
good reason, it's worth keeping. But, in the main, if we've made the wrong
decision, we cut them ruthlessly,' he says.
Selling out can mean losing out, and the team says there are many times when
it has come to regret disposing of a stock too soon. One such was Rhino
Group, a computer and video games retailer, which was sold at half the
present share price.
At the moment, Thomas does not see much value in stocks on the FT-SE, which
has many companies exposed to international earnings. 'There's some risks on
international earners, especially in Europe, so we try to avoid those.'
Pembroke's performance has slipped in the year to November, where it is in
the second decile (18th of 144). The team attributes this partly to its
dislike of non-manufacturing companies - it tends to steer clear of property
companies and other recovery and cyclical stocks, which have performed well
recently.
'We've missed out on the property sector and we don't like contractors,
either,' says Luckraft. 'One wrong contract and the business is out of the
window. We don't like nasty shocks.'
Charges: The initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual management fee 1
per cent. The bid/offer spread is about 5.7 per cent. Minimum lump sum
investment is Pounds 500 and there is a monthly savings plan of Pounds 35.
Holdings can be put into a personal equity plan without cost.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Deal that turned sour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To Iain Armstrong, it sounded like a good deal: a 50 per cent return in one
year, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. But the biology teacher now seems to
have lost the Pounds 5,000 he invested in a scheme from a man he says he
believed was acting as an agent of City Financial Partners, even though the
agreement was on unheaded paper and referred to the contract as a private
transaction.
Eighteen months later, the money has not been repaid, the man - Alistair
Fairweather - cannot be contacted and City Financial says the deal was a
private agreement between two people which has nothing to do with the
company.
Armstrong's predicament serves as a cautionary tale to others offered
returns that seem too good to be true.
He was, naturally, interested when he received a call from Fairweather, his
financial adviser of four years' standing, to tell him of an exciting
investment opportunity. 'He talked at length about unsecured loans and how
they command very high interest rates. He also talked about the success of
his business and his plans to expand it,' said Armstrong.
The agreement was that Armstrong would pay Fairweather Pounds 5,000 and that
the latter would repay him Pounds 7,500 one year later. Alarm bells should
have been set off in Armstrong's mind at the high rate of interest but the
signed agreement also referred to the loan as an 'investment in his
(Fairweather's) business expansion.' Armstrong said: 'When you go to a
financial adviser, they say they are a member of Lautro and are backed by
this and that. I thought he was acting in his capacity as financial adviser
at the company and that the company would eventually back him up.'
City Financial has terminated Fairweather's contract as a result of the debt
but says that, since the contract was a private one, Fairweather was not
acting on its behalf. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the insurance
industry, is investigating the case.
The conduct of appointed representatives - self-employed salesmen selling
the products of a single life office - in the life insurance industry has
been the main focus of efforts by Lautro to curb sales of unsuitable
products to investors.
The issue of the degree to which a Lautro member is responsible for the
actions of its agents was highlighted a year ago when Guardian Royal
Exchange was fined Pounds 100,000 by Lautro for failing to monitor
adequately two of its appointed representatives.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Taxman yields on relocation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASHBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees who have been relocated since 1986 got some good news from the
Inland Revenue this week, writes Peter Ashby*. Unless they had sold their
old house or flat, the Revenue had been seeking to collect tax on relocation
allowances given to them by their employers.
Now, following an announcement on November 23, the Revenue will no longer
pursue any individual taxpayers unless they have employers who will pay the
tax for them under what are known as tax equalisation, or tax protection,
arrangements. Even then, the Revenue will pursue only the employer.
The story started in 1986 when the Revenue insisted that, from that point
on, taxpayers had to sell their old homes to benefit from tax-free
relocation expenses. Up to then, it had merely required an individual to
move house.
Strictly speaking, the expenses have been taxable for many years, but the
Revenue had granted tax relief on an extra-statutory concession basis.
The 1986 change was to affect all taxpayers, but the Revenue directed its
attention mainly to major employers, who generally pay the tax on behalf of
their staff.
The employers and their advisers were not prepared to accept the change and
heavy lobbying, led by my firm, paid off with the Revenue's announcement. It
has now agreed to reduce the amount it will be collecting from employers as
well as the number of people likely to be affected.
The tax bills for employees could have been substantial. It is agreed
generally that the new statutory limit (which applied from April 6 1993) of
Pounds 8,000, above which relocation expenses are taxed, is inadequate.
Therefore, an average employee with a relocation package of Pounds 15,000
could have had a tax bill of Pounds 6,000 to pay if he had sold his old
home. In practice, amounts of Pounds 10,000 were commonplace and senior
employees could have had bills very much higher.
The present expatriate population in the UK is estimated at 250,000.
Obviously, not all of these are eligible for these savings - but many will
be.
In addition, many relocations within the UK involve short-term moves. The
oil industry, for one, has moved many people to the Aberdeen area of
north-east Scotland.
If employees knew they were being transferred temporarily, they would
normally expect to return to their own home. Before the revenue's
announcement, they would have had to pay tax on their relocation allowances;
now, they will not.
As far as paying UK taxes is concerned, staff without employer assistance
will benefit only if they have protested and kept their position open. Any
taxpayer who accepted the Revenue view, settled its position and paid his
tax, probably will be unable to benefit.
There are only two circumstances in which the tax is recoverable:
If the assessment of the income which includes the relocation expenses has
not been completed for some other reason, the employee can write to his
inspector, have it finalised and the tax will be repaid.
The matter might technically have been held open if inspector and taxpayer
agreed to disagree, while the latter still paid the tax.
Any repayment will not attract interest as it is being made on a
concessionary, not a statutory, basis. But anyone who refused to pay will
find his liability is now removed.
*Peter Ashby is expatriate tax partner at Price Waterhouse, and chairman of
the tax on relocation lobby group.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
October.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure shown for the month in
which you bought it. Subtract the results from the proceeds of your sale and
the balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in July 1986 and sold them
in October 1993 for Pounds 14,000. Multiplying the original cost by the July
1986 figure of 1.454 gives a total of Pounds 8,724. Subtracting that from
Pounds 14,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 5,276, which is below the
1993-94 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If you are selling shares bought
before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The RPI in
October was 141.8.

Hanson may have some good news on the US coal strike when it reports annual
profits on Thursday. The strike cost Hanson Pounds 29m in the third quarter
and it predicted it would cost Pounds 60m to Pounds 80m in the fourth, to
the end of September.
Investors are keen to see a settlement, the only question is what the coal
producers will have had to give to the mineworkers to achieve that.
The market is also hoping for a dividend increase, although forecasts are
for a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.29bn (FRS3 basis) in 1992 to
Pounds 1.05bn-Pounds 1.07bn, and around Pounds 50m less excluding disposal
profits against Pounds 1.09bn. Either way earnings per share will be
significantly lower.
Hanson pays its dividends quarterly, and has paid 2.85p for each of the last
four payments. Some feel an increase is due, perhaps to 3p a quarter, while
others think a rise will not be forthcoming.
The City is anticipating a steady and unspectacular set of figures from GEC,
which reports its first six months on Wednesday. The expectation is that the
second half of the year will be significantly stronger when a number of
large contracts are due for implementation.
Profits before tax are expected to be in the region Pounds 350m - Pounds
360m, roughly level with or perhaps slightly down on the Pounds 356m
recorded in the same period last year.
Earnings per share are expected to be about 8.1p, compared with 8p and a
five per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2.81p (2.68p) is forecast.
Bass, the UK brewing, hotels and retail group, is expected to report on
Wednesday a 5 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits from Pounds
473m to about Pounds 495m.
Brewing profits are likely to be hit by margin pressures and bad debt
provisions, and pub retailing will feel the effects of disposals.
Improvements should come from Holiday Inn in the US and UK leisure
operations.
A Pounds 175m restructuring charge will reduce Grand Metropolitan's pre-tax
profits for the year to about Pounds 770m, 16 per cent down on last year's
Pounds 913m. Thursday's announcement is expected to reveal a brighter
picture at the trading level. IDV, the spirits division, should achieve
double digit profits growth with some help from currency translation.
Another good performance is forecast for Burger King and North American food
operations will show some recovery.
Higher losses and Pounds 6m to Pounds 8m of restructuring costs at the
Racal-Redac software subsidiary and other special factors are expected to
result in markedly lower pre-tax profits at Racal Electronics, the data
communications, radio and network services group, which reports its interims
on Thursday.
Pre-tax profit estimates range from about Pounds 12m to Pounds 16m against
Pounds 23.1m at the interim stage last year. 'Normalised' pre-tax profits
are likely to be around Pounds 21.7m.
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company,is expected to announce on
Thursday pre-tax profits for the year to end September of around Pounds 99m,
down on the previous Pounds 109.6m. Net asset value is estimated to emerge
at 440p, down from 465p last time. However, the dividend is expected at
least to meet the company's June forecast of 14.75p.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets: Thorn likes pumpkin in its pie - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you cannot hum a tune by the Smashing Pumpkins, you are not alone. Even
Bottom Line's tuned-in secretary turns vague when the group is mentioned.
The Smashing Pumpkins hail from Illinois. This week Thorn EMI announced that
the group's success had helped its music division increase half-year
operating profits by 48.3 per cent to Pounds 89.9m.
A trawl of the rock reviews reveals that the Smashing Pumpkins' lyrics are
'full of regret and unfulfilled desires'. The description could be applied
to Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn's chairman.
Sir Colin's unfulfilled desire is for his work in recasting Thorn to be
recognised. He has concentrated on turning its two largest businesses, music
and rentals, into world leaders.
Yet, when he bought Virgin Music last year for Pounds 510m, making Thorn one
of the world's three biggest recording groups, the critics complained that
he had overpaid. What they ignored was that there were others waiting to buy
Virgin. It was an essential purchase if Thorn was not to be relegated to the
second rank.
As it happens, this week's results were a vindication of the acquisition.
Virgin's profits of Pounds 36.5m accounted for 41 per cent of Thorn's total
music profits.
The rental business, which rents out anything from video recorders to
jewellery, also saw profits rise 17.7 per cent to Pounds 52.6m. Overall
pre-tax of profits Pounds 105m were unchanged on last year, but were
depressed by a Pounds 10m exceptional charge arising from the sale of Thorn
lighting and Thames Television. Operating profit from continuing operations
rose to Pounds 121.3m from Pounds 97.6m.
Net borrowings of Pounds 399.2m were Pounds 98.8m lower than at the half-way
stage last year. Debt fell to 56.4 per cent of shareholders' funds from
103.6 per cent a year ago.
Yet Thorn's shares have had a rocky ride. They have gone from a high of
1,009p at the end of August, to 895p last Wednesday, the day after the
results were announced, before recovering to 923p yesterday.
Thorn has two problems. The first is that its rental division has been under
a cloud since a report on its US operations in the Wall Street Journal last
September. The newspaper alleged that the debt collection procedures of
Thorn's US staff ran to guns and gangs of Hell's Angels.
Sir Colin's reaction to the article should be on every business school
curriculum as a lesson in how not to handle bad publicity. If the charges
were false, he should have denied them. So far, he has not done so
convincingly. If they were true, he should have said the group would deal
with the perpetrators.
Instead, he said how hurt he was. Any sympathy understandably went to
Thorn's allegedly persecuted customers. Seven weeks after the article
appeared, Thorn announced that former Senator Warren Rudman would
investigate the allegations.
The second problem is that Thorn cannot sell its defence subsidiary. The
General Electric Company had a look at the business earlier this year, but
was not prepared to pay enough. It is difficult to see the value of the
business rising, however. It lost Pounds 14.7m in the first half, compared
with Pounds 1.4m last time. Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, has a
habit of biding his time. He often wins his prize, usually paying a price
considerably lower than the number first thought of.
If Thorn does get rid of its defence business, thoughts will turn to a
demerger, or the prospect of a buyer for the music division. Much attention
is being focused on multi-media, or the idea that we will watch a group play
on our screens, while our speakers pump out compact disc quality sound and
our printers spew out copies of the lyrics. A computer or cable television
or telecommunications company could buy Thorn for its collection of music
copyrights.
This sort of thing has been talked about for years, without amounting to
much. It might be different this time, but the multi-media business is as
full of unfulfilled desires as a whole stage of Smashing Pumpkins.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets: Don't be rushed by Budget hype - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The timing of this week's base rate cut is a salutary reminder that
chancellors (and governors of the Bank of England) like to surprise us.
Everyone was expecting the cut to be announced on Tuesday as a counterpoint
to tax increases in the Budget.
So, if that was a surprise, chancellor Kenneth Clarke probably has more
unexpected measures up his sleeve. Before the last Budget, I do not recall
anyone forecasting the changes which Norman Lamont made to the taxation of
dividends.
All this should emphasise the dangers of rushing out and making investment
decisions on the basis of expected Budget measures. One possibility is that
tax relief on personal pensions could be limited to 20 per cent. This has a
certain logic, in that the government has reduced other reliefs (such as
those on mortgage interest) to the 20 per cent level.
It might, thus, seem sensible for higher-rate taxpayers to make some quick
single premium payments into personal pension schemes. But implementing the
proposal would run counter to the government's obvious desire to encourage a
greater shift away from state pension provision. And even if Clarke did make
such a shift, it might well not come into force until the start of the next
tax year. Investors would then have plenty of time to consider the pros and
cons of a pension contribution in the light of hard news rather than rumour.
It seems highly plausible (although I confess the chancellor has not
confided his plans to me) that the thrust of any Budget change will involve
the personal tax allowance (Pounds 3,445 this year). Tax relief on the
allowance will be limited to 20 per cent (a measure which will cost a
higher-rate taxpayer Pounds 689 a year), but the chancellor will give some
of the money back by extending the 20 per cent band. If he widened the band
enough, he could declare it to be the basic rate of tax, thereby meeting a
long-standing Conservative tax-cutting pledge while raising taxes at the
same time.
If such a change does occur, then the various tax-free schemes (Peps, Tessas
etc) will become more important for top-rate taxpayers. But investors will
have until April to make their decisions. * * * Regular readers will know I
am a fan of indexed funds, so it is good to see the launch of a new indexed
investment trust. The Fairbairn European Smaller Companies index trust has
the added advantage of opening up a new area for indexation; to date, most
funds have been either UK-based or devoted to major overseas indices such as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.
James Capel, which is launching the fund together with Providence Capitol,
has developed a new European smaller companies index which covers 17
countries and 1,000 stocks. The investment trust will buy a basket of 350
stocks designed to replicate the capital performance of this index.
The managers believe there is an identifiable investment opportunity in
European smaller companies. In both the US and the UK, smaller company
shares have rebounded as the national economies moved out of recession. In
Europe, the recession appears to be bottoming and smaller companies have had
a long period of underperformance; a turnaround could be due.
It could be argued that indexation is less appropriate in the field of
smaller companies. One key argument in its favour is that stock markets are
efficient, so that it is impossible for active managers to beat the index
consistently. But small company shares are followed much less and the
markets are much less efficient so, accordingly, the active manager ought to
have more scope to outperform.
The managers contend, however, that if there is a opportunity for profit,
why take the risk that an active manager will underperform the index? It is
true that the Fairbairn trust is also likely to underperform the index's
total return; in view of dealing costs and the managers' 0.7 per cent annual
fee. But the charges will be taken from income and the end result should be
fairly close to the capital growth of the index.
The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 and the trust is Pep-qualifying.
* * * The European smaller companies offer is dwarfed by a rival issue, the
Mercury World Mining Trust. This has already raised a staggering Pounds 380m
from institutions, making it the largest investment trust issue ever.
It is tempting to believe that, when managers can raise Pounds 380m for a
commodity trust, it is the sign of a bull market gone mad. In fact, apart
from gold, base metals prices are severely depressed, having fallen 42 per
cent since 1989. Some of those investing in the trust will be 'gold bugs'
backing manager Julian Baring; others will be taking the view that metals
prices have been down for so long that the only way forward is up.
Contrarianism seems, paradoxically, to get ever more popular.
But some commentators believe we have entered a long deflationary phase in
which competition from emerging markets will exert a continual downward
pressure on prices.
If their view is right, then the correct investment is not commodities but a
heavy weighting in bonds, with the main equity exposure in emerging markets.
Only if you believe that world inflation will return with a vengeance, does
a mining trust make sense, and even then index-linked gilts are probably a
more sensible option.

PPP, the UK's second largest medical insurer, yesterday announced that it

FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets: Wielding the knife at Thanksgiving - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While most of the country was enjoying Thanksgiving on Thursday with
traditional excesses of turkey and televised American football, thousands of
employees of Philip Morris and NCR had little to celebrate.
On Wednesday, the food and tobacco group announced plans to close as many as
40 plants and eliminate 14,000 jobs in a restructuring programme intended to
reduceits annual operating costs by Dollars 1bn. On the same day the
computer group, NCR, said it would offer 25,000 employees early retirement
in an attempt to cut 7,500 jobs from its payroll.
The layoffs and cost-cutting measures came as a shock to equity markets,
primarily because investors believed that the long and painful restructuring
of US industry - which has been a feature of life in Corporate America for
the past two to three years - had been completed. Philip Morris and NCR,
however, have provided a sharp reminder that companies cannot afford to
relax their efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency. In an economy where
sluggish growth, weak consumer demand and almost non-existent inflation has
made price competition keen, companies have to stay fit and fast on their
feet to thrive.
This point was brought home by the fact that the restructurings at Philip
Morris and NCR were not emergency measures to keep struggling businesses
afloat. Philip Morris reported a profit of Dollars 4.9bn in 1992, the
largest of any US corporation, and although its domestic tobacco business is
under intense pricing pressures, its overseas tobacco and food businesses
are in good shape.
And, while NCR's earnings performance this year has been less than sparkling
 -the company lost money in the most recent quarter, dragging down the
profits of its parent, the telecommunications group AT&amp;T - computer industry
analysts believe NCR is well-placed to prosper, having already made the
strategic decision to shift its business away from mainframe and
minicomputers toward 'open' networks of linked computers.
None of this will be much comfort to the employees of both companies.
Neither provided details on where the cuts would be made, which will have
ruined Thanksgiving for the many thousands of workers who could lose their
jobs in the restructurings.
For millions of equity investors, however, Thanksgiving was not as
distressing as it might have been, for after a shaky start, the stock
markets weathered what could have been a difficult week relatively well.
At one point on Monday, conditions were perilous. Bond prices had dropped
sharply as investors in fixed-income securities continued to sell government
securities amid new evidence of resurgent economic growth. The subsequent
rise in bond yields to their highest levels since midsummer, and some heavy
losses in overseas equity markets spooked investors in the stock markets,
who drove the Dow down more than 40 points at one stage.
At that moment, the gloomy prediction of some analysts - that rising bond
yields would spark a sharp downward correction in share prices - looked as
if it would be fulfilled. But the declines in bond prices on Monday did not
carry through to the rest of the week, and an unexpectedly strong bond
market rally ensured that stocks stayed mostly in positive territory. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced back with modest advances on the next
two days, and were holding their own at mid-morning yesterday. Trading was
quiet because the stock markets were closed on Thursday and shut down early
on Friday, but the mood among investors was generally upbeat.
The recovery in bonds, which lowered long-term interest rates, as measured
by the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, from 6.38 per cent to 6.26 per
cent, was not the result of a fundamental change in bond market sentiment.
After all, there was nothing this week to ease fixed-income investors'
concerns that interest rates are now on a steady upward path.
Instead, bond prices rebounded on mostly technical considerations - the lack
of fresh selling on Tuesday surprised dealers and investors who had sold
bonds short in anticipation of further losses, and they were forced to buy
bonds to cover their short positions. A decline in commodity and oil prices,
the latter sparked by OPEC's failure to agree on production cuts, also
supported bond prices.
Even if it was technically-driven, the bond market's rally helped assuage
fears among equity investors that rapidly rising Treasury yields might bring
the long bull market in stocks to a halt. For that, at least, Wall Street
could give thanks.

FT  27 NOV 93 / The Long View: Throes of thrift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellors of the Exchequer like to pay respectful homage to the nation's
savers, but sometimes thrift can go too far. The personal sector savings
ratio hit a remarkable 12 1/2 per cent in 1992, and expectations of a lively
consumer-led economic recovery depend on that falling to, say, 9 per cent
next year. This is not a time when encouraging the savings habit is a
priority, which is just as well, the track record of previous chancellors in
creating tax breaks fails to stand up to close scrutiny.
One tax-based investment scheme which already has a termination date of
December 31, 1993 pinned on it is the Business Expansion Scheme, introduced
in 1983 to encourage wealthy private individuals to provide risk capital to
support small, unquoted companies.
Rather than raising the flow of capital, however, the BES seemed to increase
the risks. Few made money except the intermediaries. Soon the search was on
for lower-risk businesses which qualified under the rules, but they were
asset speculations rather than the manufacturers and traders that the
government had targeted.
The BES's final fling has been in financing rented housing, with the likes
of Oxford colleges raising millions to house students: this is a worthy
cause, no doubt, but surely does not carry a high priority for the
taxpayers' support when there is a Pounds 50bn budget deficit.
Then there was John Major's own pet scheme from his days as chancellor, the
Tessa. This popped up for no obvious reason in the 1990 Budget, and was
immediately open to the criticism that it would encourage little new saving,
but only cause existing deposits to be shifted to the tax-free accounts.
Although about Pounds 15bn has been lured into Tessas, the benefit to the
public interest is hard to see.
Neither has much of a favour been done for Tessa holders, who are now
trapped. When the accounts were first available in January 1991 they yielded
about 14 per cent. Next January the return may be down to 5 1/2 per cent and
who knows how much lower it might go? After all, the banks and building
societies can now exploit a helpless group of depositors. This is because
nearly all the Tessas were opened in 1991, and cannot be liquidated before
1996 without the loss of all previous years' tax relief.
Kenneth Clarke could do these depositors a favour, and save the Exchequer a
little future money too, by closing the Tessa scheme down after three years,
with tax relief.
Another tax-based savings scheme that has veered off course is the personal
equity plan. This was Nigel Lawson's bright idea in 1986 to encourage direct
investment in UK equities at the expense of the institutions. The Pep, along
with various employee share schemes and the privatisation of businesses on
the cheap, was intended to promote 'popular capitalism'.
Originally collective funds such as unit trusts and investment trusts were
excluded from Peps, but they lobbied hard and won a modest foothold. With
less than masterly timing, Peps were launched a few months ahead of the 1987
stock market crash and sales lagged badly. This gave the collective fund
promoters their chance: they could provide the marketing drive which might
get the Peps off the ground.
Today the Pep has become overwhelmingly a unit trust tax break, with sales
of Pounds 2bn of unit trust Peps in the last tax year. A full Pounds 6,000
annual Pep can be invested in a collective fund, only half of which need
even be in equities.
Now the unit trust trade association Autif is lobbying for Pounds 3,000
tax-exempt gilt-edged plans to be introduced in next week's Budget. The
industry could shift Pounds 1bn a year in gilt plans, it reckons. Among
other claimed advantages the gilt plans would further boost popular
capitalism - though frankly it beats me what an investment in government
bonds has to do with capitalism.
This, I suppose, should only be regarded as a nice try by the unit trust
men. But I would remind Kenneth Clarke that if he really wants to offer tax
incentives to individuals for buying gilts he simply has to offer a
tax-exempt issue through National Savings.
Norman Lamont surreptitiously reduced the appeal of Peps last March through
his cut in the rate of tax which could be reclaimed on UK company dividends
from 25 to 20 per cent. More seriously, the same applied to pensions,
including personal pension plans.
So passive last March, the pensions industry has worked up a furious
propaganda campaign ahead of the latest Budget, fearful that its formidable
remaining annual Pounds 15bn of tax reliefs will prove an irresistible
target for Clarke. Certainly the Chancellor must focus on the logic
underlying the tax treatment of the main savings schemes in pensions and
life assurance, and can ill afford to be diverted by pet projects.
Life assurance is an emergency case for the Treasury, although paradoxically
it may not figure in the Budget. Three years ago the Inland Revenue
conducted a review of life assurance taxation, but ignored the implications
of the Third Life Directive which was then only in draft but is soon due for
implementation throughout the European Union. From next July life companies
based around Europe, and especially in Luxembourg and Dublin, will be able
to market investment policies into the UK offering tax-free roll-up. Caught
napping, the life industry and the Revenue are locked in secret sessions to
find a response.
Tax men hate to recognise it, but there is a world out there where they do
things differently. When the frontiers are opened investors are no longer
helpless victims of the local tax inspectors. Internationalisation will mean
that British chancellors will no longer find it easy to devise their own
little savings schemes.
Recent history suggests that will be a thoroughly good thing.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Revolutionary forces which will destroy income tax: What has
gone wrong with the way that revenue is raised?. And how do we find a more
coherent system?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tax reforms of the 1980s have failed; the tax system is a fraud; and
next Tuesday's new-look Budget, however hard chancellor Kenneth Clarke and
his officials have laboured, is unlikely to make things better. Can anything
be done to restore legitimacy to the tax system? And if so what would it
look like?
In arguments about Budget changes, we often forget the really big question:
have we got the wrong system in the first place? Britain's first unified
Budget which combines tax and spending, is a good time to try to answer it.
But first remember that the stability of the nation may depend on having a
tax system which citizens think is reasonable, however much they dislike
paying. It was a tax revolt that helped bring about the Glorious Revolution
of 1688 and a tax revolt that led to the foundation of the US. More
recently, Margaret Thatcher's ill-judged obsession with the poll tax was the
immediate cause of her being toppled from power. Tax was the issue which
lost elections for George Bush and Neil Kinnock on two sides of the Atlantic
last year.
Although tax changes are politically fraught and technically difficult,
strong economic forces are now pushing Britain and other countries towards
radical reform.
What, then, has gone wrong after so much change and debate? Public
discussion has tended to focus on the way in which taxes redistribute wealth
from one section of the community to another. This function of tax is often
justified by the principle that an extra pound is worth more to the poor
than to the rich.
At another level, there has been vigorous debate about the level at which
taxes make the economy less efficient, for example by weakening incentives.
Above all, there was a presumption that the system would be administered by
a wise and benevolent government (like the guardians of Plato's Republic).
As a result, discussions on tax policy were elitist and secretive. Until
recently, these matters scarcely concerned most people because, as John Kay
and Mervyn King say in their classic book The British Tax System, less than
a fifth of the working population in 1939 paid income tax. Most people paid
only indirect taxes and there was no corporation tax. Everything changed
with the second world war and the rise of the welfare state.
Since 1960 the whole of the working population has become subject to income
tax. The collision of an imperfect income tax system with the growth of
public spending gave politicians a huge incentive to mess about with the
system by offering special benefits to interest groups who might help them
to get elected.
The tax system came to reward people not for what they did but for what they
were: home owners, pension scheme members, personal equity plan holders and
the rest. Rival interest groups divided the spoils according to prevailing
political pressure. The result was that patterns of saving, investing and
working became heavily distorted. Tax avoidance became a growth industry.
The idea of a progressive income tax that rose more than proportionately
with income was subverted. Distorted incentives undermined economic
efficiency.
It was at this point that conventional wisdom about redistribution
confronted an intellectual challenge from the libertarian right.
In The Constitution of Liberty, Friedrich Hayek, following Von Mises,
launched a frontal assault on the progressive character of the tax system,
arguing that a democracy in which the majority was free to impose a
discriminatory tax burden on the minority was unjust and oppressive. He
implied that the rearrangement of income and property rights by a process of
haggling between interest groups is ultimately destabilising and that if
people really understood how coercive the nature of the redistributive
process was, they would be most unlikely to endorse it.
At the same time the development of public choice theory in the US
challenged the view of a benign state run by philosopher kings. James
Buchanan and his followers offered instead a vision of a state which had
become predatory, using its monopoly power over the tax base to maximise
revenue. Theirs was a populist and constitutional alternative to the
elitist, approach. They sought non-electoral means to constrain the coercive
nature of democracy, which Lord Hailsham dubbed in Britain as 'elective
dictatorship'. The theory found an echo in the Californian tax revolt of the
late 1970s, when voters successfully restrained property taxes through the
celebrated Proposition 13.
The new Right did not score a decisive victory, however. The idea of a
social contract, outlined by the philosopher John Rawls, provides a
potential justification for redistribution that has been used as a powerful
counterweight to Hayek and his followers. Others, such as Dan Usher, the
Canadian economist, while attacking the arbitrary re-assignment of income
and property rights through the tax system, argued that redistribution which
threw up losers as well as winners was necessary to make capitalism
acceptable.
Yet by the 1980s the practical case for the reform of heavily distorted tax
systems across the world was overwhelming. The motto of reformers was
'fiscal neutrality' - the doctrine that tax should not unnecessarily
influence the way people spend and save.
Such neutralism was hostile to the kind of social engineering in which the
tax system had transformed share ownership from a personal to an
institutional habit and turned the British into a nation of home owners. It
was also hostile to high marginal rates of direct taxation. So the thrust of
reform was to reduce headline rates of tax and to broaden the tax base by
scrapping allowances and reliefs and by increasing indirect imposts such as
value added tax.
The formula was applied with varying degrees of rigour in all the
English-speaking economies. The aim was to minimise disincentives and bring
back some coherence to a ramshackle system that reflected a host of
conflicting priorities.
This brings us to the fraud. For, while some gains were made on the long
path towards neutrality, the overall result of all this frenetic budgetary
activity is that the boundaries of the state have not been rolled back and
the taxpayer is no better off. In the March budget, the Treasury's Red Book
was projecting that public expenditure in 1993-4 would amount to 45 1/2 per
cent of national income, higher than the 44 per cent which the Thatcher
government inherited when it took office in 1979. Taxes, meantime, at 34 1/2
per cent of national income are back to much the same level as in 1979,
having been higher than that in all the intervening years.
Even allowing for different stages in the economic cycle, it is clear that
the taxpayer has been hoodwinked by political rhetoric. The government's
tax-cutting credentials are a sham. Not surprising, say the public choice
theorists - this is a practical victory for the predatory state,
notwithstanding Lady Thatcher and all her works. The most that tax reform
has achieved is the reassignment of tax shares around different groups in
the population, with some modest gains in economic efficiency.
Already those gains are being eroded or off-set by other changes. The
process of simplification started by Lord Howe (chancellor from 1979 to
1983) and continued by Lord Lawson (1983-1989) led to a plethora of income
tax rates being slimmed down to just two: 25 per cent and 40 per cent. But
with Norman Lamont (1990-1993), Clarke's predecessor, the tax system
acquired new encrustations with with the announcement of a 20 per cent tax
rate.
The method of taxing pension funds, one of the more coherent parts of the
system, is being dismantled on an ad hoc basis for no better reason than
that the Treasury needs the money. New reliefs have been created and
existing reliefs tinkered with. A new cycle of sharing out the spoils and
adding new wrinkles is under way. There is, meantime, a widely held view
that the limit of how much can be taken from citizens in tax has almost been
reached.
One response is to say, why worry? If people are reluctant to pay higher
taxes, but continue to say they want more of the state services such as
education, health and pensions, perhaps this opaque system is in an obscure
way giving the electorate what it wants.
Does the libertarian right's contention that big government is growing
inexorably stand up to close examination?
As John Hills, of the London School of Economics, has shown in his study of
the welfare state for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the share of national
income taken by education health and social security has levelled out since
the mid-1970s. It has fluctuated with the economic cycle; and the latest
upturn in spending is mainly because of recession.
Yet it seems perverse to suggest that people might be happier with the
results of an opaque and deceptive political process rather than one in
which clear choices are on offer.
And whatever the level of tolerance of tax in Britain - and that tolerance
will be tested by both Norman Lamont's and Kenneth Clarke's tax increases
which have yet to take effect - there are wider grounds for thinking that
tax reform in the developed world will develop new impetus.
The first is that Europe, regardless of the future of the European Union,
cannot escape confronting new taxation problems of a kind that is more
familiar in the US federal system. And, since the widespread abolition of
exchange controls, capital has become internationally mobile. The result is
likely to be a long run shrinkage of national tax bases.
Without exchange controls, it is no longer possible for governments to tax
the citizen through inflation by defaulting on their IOUs. The citizen can
move his investment elsewhere.
Governments are following the example set by Lord Lawson in seeking to offer
low rates of corporation tax to inward investors. They recognise that
investment decisions are increasingly influenced by tax considerations.
That is how international competition in tax policy squeezes the corporate
tax base. Over the long term the ageing of the population in the developed
world will also impose an increasing burden on those workers who are not
internationally mobile. So just as US states find that high taxes and highly
redistributive tax systems drive away people and companies to lower taxed
states, European governments will find their power to tax is eroded. What
reforms would cope with a world of increasingly footloose taxpayers?
From the public choice theorists' perspective, this competition in fiscal
policy is a reform in itself. Protective state functions - defence, law and
order - will no doubt continue to be financed by central government. But
taxes for other purpose will be closely questioned.
To that end Geoff Mulgan and Robin Murray, of the independent think tank
Demos, have argued for hypothecation or earmarking taxes so that people know
what a particular tax is being spent on. Yet as the Institute for Fiscal
Studies has pointed out, if the level of spending is dictated by earmarked
tax revenues, it will go up and down with the economic cycle. So national
insurance revenues go down in recession, just when the need for social
security goes up.
A reform with wider potential is the radical system suggested by the Meade
Committee in the late 1970s. This was that people should be taxed on what
they spend rather than on what they earn or own. This would transfer
taxation to the point at which people derive benefit from their money rather
than the benefit they might obtain from their income or assets.
An expenditure tax, would overcome all the traditional problems that income
taxes have with inflation, depreciation, the valuation of pension rights and
of human capital. By operating on cash flow rather than income it abolishes
the differential taxation of particular forms of income and saving. It can
be progressive, rising more than proportionately with income.
Politicians often claim that the administrative problems of switching to an
expenditure tax would be overwhelming. But perhaps politicians are also
worried that such a tax would be more transparent. Individuals and companies
would discover that their tax bills were far higher than today's headline
rates.
It takes a crisis to push through such a radical reform. But many tax
theorists, including Charles McClure, main author of the first Reagan tax
reform package, believe that income tax, on which the 1980s reforms were
based, is in its death throes.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Yeltsin threatens broadcasting ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday warned that Russian politicians who
attacked his draft constitution could have their free air-time for party
political broadcasts confiscated.
Mr Yeltsin urged candidates 'not to sling mud at each other' and to campaign
in a 'more civilised way'.
His comments showed a combination of paternalism and a more authoritarian
streak as he attempted to dictate the content of political debate. The
constitution will be put to a referendum on the same day as parliamentary
elections on December 12.
Mr Yeltsin - in a reference to the bloody crushing of a parliamentary
uprising - said the price paid for a constitution to be submitted to the
people had already been too high. His legal department also issued a
statement saying it was absurd for candidates to run for parliament while
calling for a boycott of the constitution, which would make the elections
null and void.
His request for a clean campaign was echoed in 'recommendations' issued by
the special arbitration court which is supposed to monitor media coverage of
the elections.
It said that the prime duty of candidates was to tell voters about their
programmes so they could decide whom to vote for. The court also said
candidates should not slander each other.
It cited an insinuation by Mr Stanislas Govoriukhin, a film-maker running
for the Democratic party, linking Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia's
Choice, with the theft of billions of roubles from the state mint during the
October 3 uprising.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic (neo-fascist)
party, was criticised for 'whipping up ethnic hatred'.
The court also suggested that candidates should devote more time to debate
among each other rather than using free television time for monologues.
Mr Yeltsin revealed that he wanted parliament to be housed in the former
Comecon building - home to some of the Moscow mayor's offices and
international organisations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. The Comecon skyscraper is next to the White House, the old
parliamentary building which will become government offices.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Reynolds wants summit plan for an end to Ulster violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday set the creation of
a joint UK-Irish framework for a permanent end to violence in Northern
Ireland as the priority of his forthcoming summit with Mr John Major.
His emphasis on securing an end to terrorism came as Mr James Molyneaux, the
Ulster Unionist party leader, said it was possible that there could be
'significant developments over the weekend with regard to the terrorist
situation'. He offered little explanation, but told his party executive in
Belfast that more detailed information would be available early next week.
As Mr Reynolds stepped up his campaign to reassure unionists in Northern
Ireland of their veto over constitutional change, an opinion poll showed a
majority of people in the Irish republic would support dropping their
country's constitutional claim on the province. The poll, reported in the
Irish Times, found that 51 per cent of those surveyed would agree to replace
the claim with an aspiration, with 28 per cent against.
Meanwhile, the UK government continued to hesitate over the timing of the
summit, although Irish officials appeared confident that it would go ahead
on Friday. There were also signs of important differences in the approach of
the two governments to the summit.
Mr Reynolds, who sent draft proposals to Mr Major on a possible framework
for peace, wants the summit to concentrate on providing the background
against which the IRA might declare an end to violence.
That would involve a post-summit statement by the two leaders combining
pledges to unionists on the constitutional integrity of the province with
recognition of the legitimacy of the nationalist aspirations of the Catholic
minority.
It would also imply a further offer to Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
of an eventual place at the negotiating table in return for an end to
violence.
But Mr Reynolds' focus on the short-term possibilities for a halt to the
IRA's military campaign conflicts with the much greater emphasis being
placed by Mr Major on the need for a comprehensive political settlement.
The UK prime minister has indicated that he is taking seriously the
possibility that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, might be serious
about ending the violence.
However, amid growing alarm among moderate unionists about the direction of
negotiations with Dublin, Mr Major wants the summit to provide the
springboard for all-party talks on a political settlement.
Mr Reynolds believes that should take second place to the peace process.

FT  27 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Underlying the 17 per cent fall in the Nikkei over the past month is the
fear that economic recovery might be receding to the end of next year and
beyond. There is no consensus on when the upturn might happen or on how
strong it will be - just a deepening general depression about the continuing
stream of poor economic and corporate results, including those in the past
few days from the banks.
Two things are necessary to revive the market. One is a large economic
stimulus from the government, with cuts in both corporate and income taxes.
The other is evidence that Japanese industry is prepared to cut costs far
more than up till now. Otherwise it will be hard pushed to improve earnings
when the outlook for sales is so poor. Both developments are politically
difficult, but if they do not come about, the index could easily drift down
below 16,000 points. At that point the market's weakness would start to
threaten banks' capital ratios, putting another restraint on recovery.

FT  27 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 3bn of new issues which the equity market has swallowed this year
is causing some tummy rumbles. With institutional investors grumbling about
poor quality issues and the ambitious prices, sponsors would be wise to
defer remaining flotations until next year. The looming Budget and recent
wobbles in the equity market have proved unsettling, while the glutted
market has produced some disappointing take-ups. The collapse of Swithland
Group soon after its attempted float marks the mood of the times.
Another deterrent to investors has been the poor stagging opportunities on
new issues. The book-building techniques used for bigger flotations have
enabled vendors to achieve high prices, but disillusion quickly spreads if a
company's performance disappoints. Next year's crop of possible big
flotations, including William Hill and House of Fraser, may have to be more
keenly priced. The absence of trade buyers this year should perhaps also
induce a mood of caution. That, though, may reflect the different risk
calculations between fund managers and industrialists. Money managers, who
view the world in terms of relative performance, can afford to chance their
arm provided their peers all bet the same. Industrial managers are driven by
absolute standards and must be sure of better odds. Just one mistake will
cost them dear.
That said, if the present cycle follows previous patterns - and recent US
experience - the wave of flotations may well be followed by a rise in
corporate mergers and acquisitions. Indeed, for those brave enough to dare,
it might be the perfect time for leveraged buy - outs. With borrowing costs
at their lowest for a generation and the economy swinging upwards, there
could be high rewards for those with enough gall to persuade the banks to
lend them money.

FT  27 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Budget rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's almost imperceptible rise in the market despite the half-point
base rate cut may be no more than a signal that it is better to travel than
arrive. Equally it may indicate a sensible level of caution ahead of the
Budget. Yet there are hints that investors are beginning to baulk at paying
prospective multiples of over 20 times for a market where a strong earnings
recovery is far from assured. While the Confederation of British Industry's
reduced growth estimate for 1994 might simply be a last minute hint to the
chancellor, the market is starting to take seriously the cautions from
company chairmen. Such strength as there was in the market apparently came
from Lloyd's investment trust funds being parked in equities.
Still, unless the chancellor savages the pension funds' tax benefits or
raises taxes very sharply, equities will probably consolidate. Short term
rates may not fall again soon, but with the inflation outlook still
extremely favourable, the interest rate cycle may not have bottomed yet.
Prospects for gilts hinge on the Budget projections of the deficit, though
given the ease with which this year's requirement has been raised, there
seems little risk of a significant bout of nerves soon.
International factors will probably be the decisive influence. On the one
hand, economic news from continental Europe continues to be poor; on the
other, stronger growth in the US raises the prospect of steadily climbing
bond yields and the possibility of a tightening by the Federal Reserve. If
that process starts in earnest UK equities will need that earnings recovery
to maintain their poise.

FT  27 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Canada rides high on economic optimism
 -Stocks have set new records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A lunch-hour visit to the offices of Green Line Investor Services, Canada's
biggest discount brokerage, in one of downtown Toronto's vast underground
shopping malls reveals a queue of investors lining up near the entrance for
a peek at the share quotation machine. Off to one side, another group waits
to open trading accounts and place orders.
Business has never been better for Green Line. It is opening twice as many
accounts as at this time last year, and in recent weeks trading volumes have
set new records.
Bulls would argue that the explosion of interest among small investors
augurs well for equities: money is pouring into the market, especially
through mutual funds and new stock issues. Green Line reports that the ratio
of buy to sell orders has climbed to 1.3 to 1 this month, from 1.1 to 1 in
October.
'The best place is still Canadian stocks,' says Ms Jill Parrett, executive
vice-president at CIBC Investment Management, which runs a stable of mutual
funds for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Ms Parrett forecasts that the
TSE-300 composite index, which closed at 4,220.61 yesterday, could rise to
4,500 by late 1994, producing returns well above those likely on
fixed-income securities.
Richardson Greenshields, a Toronto-based securities firm, is even more
optimistic, predicting that the index could reach 4,800 next year.
But could the stampede by small investors also be a sign that the smart
money is sitting on the sidelines for the time being? Mr Neil Johnson,
portfolio strategist at Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto, for instance, expects a
significant correction in share prices over the next 6-8 months. Pension and
mutual fund managers report that they are having to search much harder for
attractive investments. In the absence of bargains, many funds have raised
the cash portion of their holdings in recent months.
It took almost six years for the TSE-300 to regain its August 1987 peak of
4,112. But since last summer the market has roared from one record to
another. The latest high was 4,303, reached on November 12, representing a
28 per cent climb since the start of 1993.
The case for another surge is based largely on optimism about Canada's
economic prospects and commodity prices. The economic growth rate is
expected to accelerate to over 3 per cent next year.
While the TSE's advance has so far centred on gold, energy and other export
sectors, stronger domestic growth could also propel the shares of
consumer-oriented companies.
Third-quarter earnings have buoyed investors' spirits. Banks have reported
that their portfolios of non-performing loans are starting to shrink.
Bombardier, the Montreal-based transport equipment maker, boosted
third-quarter income by almost a third. PWA, the financially-stretched
parent of Canadian Airlines International, enjoyed its best operating
performance in six years.
Furthermore, low interest rates - the yield on 3-month treasury bills is
presently heading down towards 4 per cent - have sparked interest in real
estate stocks.
The optimists are also looking to a recovery in 1994 of long depressed
commodity markets, such as nickel, zinc, newsprint and pulp, as a
combination of production cutbacks and rising demand takes effect. Natural
gas producers, which have already benefited from a steep climb in prices
over the past 18 months, remain a long-term favourite among fund managers.
But the voices of caution can marshall an equally impressive array of
arguments. They point out that the TSE has enjoyed a virtually uninterrupted
climb for the past three years. 'The Canadian market is giving everyone a
bit of vertigo,' said one mutual fund manager earlier this month as the
TSE-300 broke through another record.
In spite of the pullback in recent weeks, shares of companies included in
the TSE-300 are trading at an average p/e of about 25, on higher than
projected 1993 earnings, compared to an average p/e ratio of less than 20
for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Although the economy is improving, a succession of prominent companies have
surprised the market with hefty restructuring charges. They include Royal
Bank of Canada (the country's biggest financial institution), Laidlaw (waste
management and transport services), Northern Telecom (telecommunications)
and Inco (nickel mining).
Most unsettling is the recent tone in the US Treasury bond market: any rise
in US interest rates is likely to pull down Canadian bond prices, as well as
the TSE.
But even Nesbitt Thomson's Mr Johnson predicts that the setback, if it
materialises, will interrupt, rather than abort, the bull market. He says
that the combination of a long period of steady economic growth and low
inflation, followed by rising commodity prices in 1995, could kindle a new
fire under stocks.
The resource-based TSE normally outperforms US stock markets only towards
the end of a business upswing, as raw material shortages come to the fore.
With this in mind, the investors lining up at the Green Line offices might
fare better if they wait a few more months before jumping into the market.

FT  27 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2.9% on
worries over banks

<TEXT>
Following Thursday's interim results from leading commercial banks, renewed
fears over the health of Japan's banking sector discouraged investors and
share prices plunged on index-linked arbitrage selling and margin unwinding,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average lost 496.55, or 2.9 per cent to 16,726.37, 6.8 per
cent down on the week and below the psychological support level of 17,000
for the first time since March 5. The Topix index of all first section
stocks plunged 47.31, or 3.2 per cent, to 1,424.54.
The Nikkei tried to recover initially, rising to a day's high of 17,351.74;
although it then lost ground on arbitrage selling it managed to close the
morning session above the 17,000 level, thanks to buying by investment trust
funds. However, the arbitrage selling then took over and the index fell to a
low of 16,675.77 just before the close.
Volume totaled 340m shares against 314m. Losers led gainers by 982 to 103
with 88 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.57 to 1,149.00.
Traders said that hedge funds their took cue from poor earnings, and a rise
in non-performing loans at the country's leading commercial banks. Combined
pre-tax profits of 11 leading commercial banks showed a fall of 22.2 per
cent during the first half to September, while non-performing loans
increased by 9.6 per cent.
Bank stocks led the fall, the Nikkei banking index plunging by 5.4 per cent.
Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y180 to Y2,990 and Bank of Tokyo fell Y130 to
Y1,530.
East Japan Railway declined Y15,000 to Y421,000 and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone losing Y38,000 to Y685,000, closing below Y700,000 for the first
time since March 4.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 554.58 to 18,676.38 in volume of 20.2m
shares. Roundup
A divergent pattern of trading continued in the region.
BOMBAY surged 5.2 per cent to a 14 month high, fuelled by heavy buying by
foreign funds in a market where domestic investors were reluctant to sell on
the view that prices are likely to continue rising until announcement of the
national budget in the last week of February.
The BSE index rose 155.62 to 3,233.14, for an 8.8 per cent rise on the week.
SINGAPORE reported renewed buying by domestic institutions as the Straits
Times Industrial index rose 16.81 to 2,107.98, 0.7 per cent higher on the
week.
China news lifted Sembawang Ship by 60 cents to SDollars 14.00 on
electricity and engineering contracts and Wing Tai by 16 cents to SDollars
3.90 on its Chinese expansion plan.
SEOUL was sharply lower in a day of reduced trading volume in spite of a
late institutional buying flurry of banking shares. The composite index shed
9.38 to 810.04, 3.6 per cent lower on the week.
Brokers forecast a dip in the index to the 780 level as institutional
investors sell stock following government encouragement to liquidate
holdings to cool the overheated market.
MANILA rebounded after a three-day slide, the composite index ending 24.98
higher at 2,375.59, down 0.7 per cent on the week.
TAIWAN was cautious ahead of Saturday's local government elections, and late
selling took the weighted index down by 34.53 to 4,163.99, 1.5 per cent
lower on the week in turnover of TDollars 22.6 bn.
Brokers agreed that the Finance Ministry's announcement on Thursday that it
would ease curbs on foreign investment in the market was bullish, but
investors were unwilling to back their judgement on the day.
HONG KONG closed down a shade on the day, and fractionally higher on the
week with the Hang Seng index at 9,274.42, down 11.89.
KUALA LUMPUR edged higher on selective demand for speculative and low priced
stocks and the composite index added 6.03 to 976.34, for a 0.8 per cent fall
on the week.
AUSTRALIA balanced investment buying after a strong overnight close in
London with pessimistic futures trading and the All Ordinaries index
finished 1.1 better at 2,043.1, but 1.9 per cent down on the week.

FT  27 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profits are taken in
Commerzbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading was generally muted in reflection of Wall Street's half session,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT mulled over Thursday's company news, and looked ahead to next week
as the market flattened out in advance of monthly settlement day. The DAX
index eased 0.47 to 2,047.24, down 1.5 per cent on the week, as turnover
fell from DM8.5bn to DM7.8bn.
Dealers took profits after the progress report from Commerzbank, were less
decisive over Volkswagen's four-day week, and continued to dislike
Metallgesellschaft after results which, said James Capel, showed how
desperately the group needs a substantial cut in its cost base.
Commerzbank fell DM3.50 to DM359.50 after Thursday's 52 per cent jump in
10-month profits, while Berliner Bank and Bayernhypo put on DM12 at DM443.50
and DM4.20 at DM468.20 ahead of next week's figures.
VW stumbled over details of the four-day week, and fell DM6 to DM406 after a
DM9.50 gain the day before; Metallgesellschaft fell DM6 to DM379 for a loss
of DM40 this week.
PARIS was little changed on the day but moderately higher on the week, the
CAC-40 index adding 2.22 to 2,120.62, and 1.2 per cent respectively.
Turnover was moderate at FFr3.4bn.
Rhone-Poulenc saw a delayed opening and then rose 2 per cent in reaction to
news after hours on Thursday that institutional investors would be offered
shares at FFr146 each, compared with the public offering at FFr135. However,
the shares soon slipped back, closing off FFr3.80 at FFr150.10.
After a volatile week's trading, Euro Disney closed up FFr1.50 at FFr30.90,
a week's decline of 16 per cent.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by a strong performance from Nedlloyd, the shipping
group, which advanced by Fl 2.80 to Fl 55.40 following better than expected
third quarter results.
The CBS Tendency index put on 1.1 to 136.8, marginally firmer on the week.
KLM put on another 90 cents to Fl 39.90, picking up some ground lost after
the failure of the Alcazar talks was announced at the start of the week.
Royal Dutch lost another Fl 1.90 to Fl 193.70 on the weaker oil price.
MILAN finished firmer on strong demand by domestic institutions,
particularly for shares which had fallen earlier in the week. The Comit
index rose 5.46 to 541.52, an 0.5 per cent fall over the week, but a strong
come back after the cumulative 5.9 per cent fall on Monday and Tuesday.
'The market will be in the hands of the politicians until the end of the
year,' said Mr Guiseppe Bonini of Intersim in Milan.
Mediobanca returned to favour with a L670 or 5.9 per cent rise to L12,100.
Benetton added L720 to L23,010 for a two day advance of 8.8 per cent as the
clothing group forecast a 10 per cent rise in 1993 turnover.
Fiat edged L59 ahead to L3,861 as Thursday's rumours subsided.
ZURICH finished firm, with the week's inflation news giving heart to
optimists for lower interest rates. The SMI index added 15.1 to 2,741.9 for
a 0.3 per cent rise on the week.
Banks were supported by brokers' recommendations, CS Holdings rising SFr85
to SFr3,540. Electrowatt, also finding favour with analysts, added SFr150 to
SFr3,590.
MADRID was boosted by another rally in electrical utilities, offsetting
weakness in banks as the general index closed 1.13 higher at 297.91, 2.2 per
cent lower on the week in turnover of Pta20.65bn.
Endesa was one of the biggest gainers, rising Pta100 to Pta6,480, with
Iberdrola up Pta22 at Pta918 and Fenosa by Pta11 to Pta545. Dividends are
due to be paid out soon in the sector, and the recent downtrend in interest
rates should lift profit margins.
STOCKHOLM saw a SKr13 fall to SKr395 in Atlas Copco as the compressor maker
announced nine month figures. The Affarsvarlden index shed 1.4 to 1312.6,
3.5 per cent lower on the week.
OSLO was dragged lower by a sharp fall for Hafslund Nycomed, the
pharmaceutical company, and the all share index fell 4.19 to 578.85.
Hasfslund A shares closed NKr8.5 weaker at NKr111 after the company forecast
that 1993 pre-tax profits would only match 1992 results.
BRUSSELS reflected drifted to a lower close, with a 24-hour general strike
in protest at government austerity measures, the keeping foreign investors
cautious and trading volumes low. The Bel-20 index closing 3.72 lower at
1,392.17, 0.9 per cent down on the week.
ISTANBUL rose to another record high in spite of some moderate profit-taking
towards the close. The composite index gained 231.0 to 17.426.1, a week's
rise of 5.4 per cent.

FT  27 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Losses in oils offset bond
yields decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices ended a shortened day little changed from opening values as
the positive impact of another decline in bond yields was offset by losses
in oil stocks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the 1 pm close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.08 at
3,684.50. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.70 at
463.06, while the Amex composite was 0.05 lower at 463.46, and the Nasdaq
composite 1.69 higher at 754.87. Trading volume on the NYSE was 91m shares.
Trading reopened after Thanksgiving in subdued mood. Many participants chose
to stay away from the markets and extend the holiday into the weekend, and
the New York Stock Exchange agreed to end trading early at 1 pm.
The main feature of the day was falling oil prices.
The declines were sparked by the failure of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (Opec) to agree on cutting oil production levels.
Energy market analysts, who had been expecting an agreement on production
cuts, were surprised by the development, and oil prices dropped sharply to a
new five-year low.
This was positive for bonds, because falling oil prices will help dampen
worldwide inflation. Consequently, Treasury prices rallied, with the
benchmark 30-year bond rising more than half a point, lowering its yield to
6.26 per cent.
While this was good news for equity investors, who have been unsettled
lately by rising bond yields, it caused havoc among oil shares. This, in
turn, depressed the Dow, because the average is heavily weighted in oil
stocks.
Among the biggest decliners Texaco lost Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 63 3/4 ,
Exxon fell Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 61 5/8 , Mobil dropped Dollars 3 5/8 at
Dollars 75, Phillips Petroleum fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 ,
British Petroleum lost Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 58 3/4 and Royal Dutch
Petroleum slipped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 100.
What was bad for oil companies, however, was good for airlines, which will
enjoy the benefits of lower jet fuel costs. UAL rose Dollars 4 1/8 to
Dollars 143 1/2 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, added Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 67 3/8 , USAir put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 13 3/4 and Delta rose
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/2 .
Optimism about consumer demand during the Christmas shopping season
supported retail stocks. JC Penney rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 53, the
Limited firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 23, Sears added Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 55 3/4 , and May Department Stores firmed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
44.
Philip Morris, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 56 3/8 , continued to benefit from
its recently announced plan to cut corporate costs by closing plants and
laying off thousands of workers. AT&amp;T, whose NCR subsidiary also announced a
cost-cutting programme this week, rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 55 3/4.

FT  27 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil stocks reel on Opec deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil sector provided three of the market's most heavily traded stocks
yesterday as domestic and international institutions acted on Opec's
controversial move to maintain the 24.5m barrels a day output level it first
agreed last September.
And the overwhelming view of the market, confirming Thursday's knee-jerk
reaction, was that Opec had been wrong to hold its production quotas. BP
wrested the mantle of the sector's heaviest traded stock from Lasmo, with
Shell close behind.
BP shares ran back sharply, closing 9 1/2 off at 332 1/2 p, on heavy
turnover of 16m shares, as dealers said US holders of the shares had begun
to unload significant amounts of stock. Merrill Lynch, regarded as one of
the world's biggest and most powerful stockbrokers, was said to have adopted
a much more cautious outlook on oils in general and BP in particular.
Merrill was said to have cited the Opec meeting and subsequent oil price
considerations as the catalyst for a general downgrading of oils.
BP was pinpointed as especially vulnerable to downside pressure in the
medium to long-term with the market concerned about the possibility of the
Kuwait Investment Office deciding to dump its near-10 per cent stake in the
group and, even further out, the chances of the group launching a
substantial rights issue.
Shell slipped 6 to 678p after exceptionally high turnover of 9.1m shares.
The worst performance in the sector, however, came from Lasmo whose shares
slumped 11 to 117p, on 17m traded, as the market continued to fret about the
chances of the company cutting the final dividend next March.
A big line of Lasmo stock - 3.6m shares - was sold into the market early in
the session amid talk that one broking house had drastically reduced its
core asset valuation.
One bull point for the stock, however, was a view that that PDFM (Phillips &amp;
Drew's fund management group) had continued to increase its stake in Lasmo;
on Thursday PDFM said it had taken its stake to over 11 per cent.
Elsewhere, Burmah Castrol fell 5 to 735p after a sizeable agency cross
involving a block of 650,000 shares, the same stock that had been offered in
the market some weeks ago.

FT  27 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Further advance as market regains
confidence - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revived confidence that next week's Budget will not deal too harshly with
the fragile UK economy brought another day of widespread gains in the London
stock market yesterday. Further weakness in oil shares failed to hold London
back, although there was heavy trading after the New York's blue chip oil
majors opened down.
Equities were again driven ahead by a strong buyer in the futures market,
where traders believe that overseas investors have turned more positive
ahead of the Budget speech due on Tuesday from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer.
After a slow start, share prices turned sharply upwards and by mid-session
the FT-SE Index was more than 30 points ahead at 3,123.4. There was some
nervousness ahead of Wall Street's return from the Thanksgiving Day break.
London fell back as profits were taken before the equity trading account
closed at 4.30 pm, and the final reading on the FT-SE of 3,111.4 showed a
net rise on the day cut to 18.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was also firmer,
gaining 9.7 to 3,454.9.
There was general satisfaction with comments in parliament by the chancellor
which seemed to confirm that Budget tax increases would lean on the consumer
rather than on industry. In particular, the stock market appeared less
fearful that tax changes on life assurance companies were planned. These
could have hit both at premium income and investment policies at the big
life companies.
The recovery in the stock market over the past two days has left the FT-SE
Index 3.4 points up on the week and only 12.3 up over the two week trading
account. But on Wednesday, the Footsie closed at 3,067.2 in spite of the
half point reduction in base rates on the previous day.
Activity in futures was complemented by a lengthy but fairly modest trading
programme in equities. Traders believe that, while UK funds remain cautious,
overseas funds are buyers on equities on the grounds that the Bundesbank is
likely to cut rates soon, perhaps next Thursday.
Traders admitted that the close of the two week trading account had caught
marketmakers short of stock in the face of the sudden turn in sentiment. But
many were surprised by the strength of the market which is now so close to
Budget Day. 'In the past, trading has always died away as Budget Day drew
near,' said one. 'But this time it is not just a few speculators at work.
There is real investment business out there.'
Seaq volume remained high, with the day's 697.6m shares traded comparing
with 696.3m in the previous session. Retail, or customer business was worth
Pounds 1.59bn on Thursday, a strong figure for what had been been a session
marked by pre-Budget caution and Wall Street's closure.
Although the oil stocks suffered heavy pressure, especially after Exxon
opened around 4 per cent off in New York, the rest of the international
sectors responded well to a dip of only 6.43 on the Dow Industrial Average
in London hours. There were good rises among the interest rate-related
issues, including the stores and some banks.
UK strategists suggested that global investors have become more confidene
that Wall Street will prove able to shake off the weakness in the US Federal
bond market, and respond to the signs of growth in the US economy.

FT  27 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another largely featureless day in the futures market aped the pattern of
the previous session when a large buy order from one UK broker provided the
stimulus to carry the market forward for most of yesterday's session, writes
Christopher Price.
The December FTSE futures contract opened quietly at 3,111, with trading
seen in a tight range. However, late morning saw a leading UK investment
bank come in with a substantial buy order. This prompted other buyers and
produced a squeeze in the December contract. By mid-afternoon trading had
slowed and December drifted, slipping to the 3,120-level. A late flurry saw
it close at 3,125, some 14 points above the cash market and around 10 over
the fair value premium currently standing at approximately 4. Turnover was a
respectable 12,000.
In traded options, 37,710 contracts were traded, 14,257 done in the FTSE
contract. BT headed the stock option list, with 3,146 traded.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Profit-taking affects pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling suffered a late sell-off in traditionally thin end-of-week trading
ahead of the Budget while the French franc was boosted by a reduction of
central Bank debts, writes Peter John.
The pound fell two pfennigs from its high against the D-Mark and more than a
cent against the dollar as speculators and some UK corporate selling took
advantage of its recent strength.
Currency moves are generally exaggerated on Fridays and more so yesterday
when cash flows were further reduced because many US dealers were still away
from their desks following Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
Also, some economists said the enthusiastic response to Tuesday's cut in UK
base rates and subsequent rise in the pound was overdone.
Chart analysts saw DM2.54 as a significant ceiling for the pound and
yesterday the selling began after it hit a high of DM2.5442 against the
D-Mark. There was a sharp slide in the early afternoon and a second fall an
hour or so later. By the close of dealing in Europe sterling was down to
DM2.5325 against the German currency from DM2.5425 previously. The pattern
was mirrored against the dollar and sterling dropped to Dollars 1.4800 from
Dollars 1.4885 previously.
However, the Irish punt, seen as a cheaper version of the UK currency,
continued to strengthen and closed above the D-Mark in the European Monetary
system for the first time in recent weeks.
The French currency hit its highest level since the crisis in the exchange
rate mechanism which led to a widening of ERM currency fluctuation bands on
August 2. The franc was buoyed by news on Thursday that the Bank of France
had repaid 80 per cent of the debts incurred at the end of July when it
tried to ward off speculative attacks on the currency. It closed yesterday
at FFr3.4560 to the D-Mark against FFr3.4650 previously.
The Finnish markka held ground in spite of a reduction in one of the
country's key lending rates. The Finnish tender rate was reduced by 0.23
percentage points to 6.65 per cent but economists said the cut was
anticipated.
The Portuguese escudo fell steeply in thin afternoon trade on reports that
financing for the purchase of Pego power station had been largely completed.
A British-led consortium signed an Es155bn escudo contract on Thursday to
buy the half-built thermal power station from the state utility, EDP -
Electricidade de Portugal. The financing involved a swap of around DM1bn
into escudos, dealers said.
Outside Europe, the Japanese yen finally weakened on heavy selling of
Japanese equities while the dollar was resilient ahead of employment data
next week.
The yen had survived the previous onslaught on the Nikkei because investors
were repatriating funds to compensate for their losses. But economists said
the persistent weakness of the Japanese stock market was finally affecting
the currency which eased to Y108.65 against the dollar from Y108.30
previously.
The dollar has been recovering against the yen as the US economy shows signs
of picking up.
It has remained within a tight range against the D-Mark and economists are
looking towards the key non-farm payroll data at the end of next week for an
excuse to push it above it its current ceiling of DM1.72.

Complete lack of activity during the past fortnight has brought a weaker
market for all grades of black and white pepper, reports Man Producten. In
spite of the relatively low stocks everywhere more selling pressure has
accumulated lately and prices started to drop faster, especially for white
pepper. White muntok pepper is being offered at Dollars 2,800 a tonne, cif,
and black pepper grade 1 can be bought at Dollars 1,400, cif. White is
certainly still overvalued whereas the opposite is true for black.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Oil slides after Opec
talks failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last prop was knocked from under the oil market on Wednesday when
ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in
Vienna, abandoned their attempt to agree a reduced production ceiling.
The next day saw crude prices plunge nearly 80 cents a barrel to touch a
five year low, and in late trading yesterday the February futures position
at the International Petroleum Exchange was still languishing at Dollars
14.75 a barrel, down Dollars 1.27 on the week.
The week began with traders cautiously hopeful that the Opec ministers would
bite the bullet, and the February futures price edged up 28 cents a barrel
on Monday moring. That gain was quickly erased, however, as the meeting got
down to business and it became apparent that consensus was sadly lacking.
Despite flagging demand in consuming countries and a resulting decline in
prices several of the ministers proved immovably opposed to making the cut
of between 3 and 5 per cent in the 24.52m barrels-a-day ceiling that
analysts thought necessary to reverse the slide.
For the platinum and palladium markets Tuesday was an uncomfortable day.
Already tending lower, the prices took something of a hammering after
Engelhard Corporation of the US announced that it had developed a new motor
emission control system. Fearing that this would threaten the use of the
platinum group metals in the manufacture of autocatalysts, traders at the
New York Mercantile Exchange marked down platinum's January futures price by
2.3 per cent to Dollars 372.10 a troy ounce and palladium's March price by
2.75 per cent to Dollars 125.50 an ounce.
It transpired, however, that the Engelhard system, which trapped hydrocarbon
emissions during the first two minutes of vehicle operation that a catalytic
converter took to become effective, would be an addition to, rather than a
replacement for, traditional converters using platinum group metals.
Most of the falls were therefore recovered. Before the Thanksgiving closure
Nymex's January platinum price was quoted at Dollars 375.7 an ounce and
further gains were subsequently made in London.
At the London Commodity Exchange most attention was focused on the cocoa
market, which moved up to test a fresh resistance area after last week's
climb to five-year highs.
A Pounds 35 retreat to Pounds 1,005 a tonne in the March futures position
was reversed on Wednesday afternoon, and the upturn was extended on
Thursday, when a new high of Pounds 1,250 a tonne was reached. Yesterday's
continued rise was halted just short of the Pounds 1,059 peak reached in
July 1988.
The cocoa market has been buoyed recently by hopes that the supply/demand
deficits of the past two seasons could augur a longer term draw-down from
world stocks. But the latest rise was attributed in part to concern about
the political situation in the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa
producer, following rumours early in the week of the death of the country's
veteran President Houphouet-Boigny and a subsequent blackout on news of him.
Base metals prices were generally held in narrow ranges at the London Metal
Exchange. The exception was lead, which jumped Dollars 11.75 in the three
months position yesterday to end Dollars 14.75 up on the week at Dollars
428.50 a tonne. Dealers gave the credit to chart-based buying that succeeded
in breaking resistance in the Dollars 415-Dollars 420 area.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris to cut jobs at
Richmond unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and beer group, is to cut the
workforce at one of its main US cigarette manufacturing plants by 10 per
cent.
About 800 hourly-paid workers and 100 salaried employees will lose their
jobs at the Richmond, Virginia plant operated by Philip Morris USA, the
subsidiary responsible for domestic production of Marlboro, Benson &amp; Hedges
100s, Merit and other cigarette brands.
Earlier this week the group had warned that it planned to reduce its global
workforce by 14,000 in a restructuring aimed at defending its brands against
low-cost competitors.
The Richmond manufacturing operation, employing 9,000, looked particularly
vulnerable to lay-offs because Philip Morris has faced a severe fall in
revenues from the domestic cigarette market following the outbreak of a
price war earlier this year.
The company said world demand for for US blend cigarettes was growing, and
its share of the market was continuing to increase.
The job losses will begin in June next year.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc allotments scaled
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand for shares in the privatisation issue of Rhone-Poulenc, the
French chemicals group, has prompted the government to scale down
allocations for individual investors, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, said yesterday.
Individual investors will receive a minimum of 16 shares in the company, the
second to be privatised as part of the government's programme to sell 21
publicly-owned groups. Investors who applied for a separate allocation, to
be paid for with Balladur bonds - a government debt issue launched last
summer - will be entitled to a further 15 shares.
Individuals were originally offered 60 shares in Rhone Poulenc, and a
further 60 if they paid with Balladur bonds. The issue, however, was three
times oversubscribed, prompting the reduced allocations and a clawback of 15
per cent of the shares allocated to institutional investors.
Mr Alphandery described yesterday's allocations as the 'very minimum'. 'The
remainder will be shared out in the next few days' he said.
The price set for individual investors was FFr135 per share, compared with
the FFr146 paid by institutional investors.
Yesterday, Rhone Poulenc's shares fell by FFr3.8 to FFr150.1.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu to raise FM750m by
share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, fell yesterday on
news that the Finnish mining and metals group plans to raise about FM750m
(Dollars 145m) via an international offering of shares and a warning that
there would be a loss in the last four months of this year.
This would be alleviated by a gain of FM270m from the sale, completed in
October, of its 96 per cent interest in the OM Group, a US speciality
chemicals company.
In the first eight months a fall in the value of the markka helped the group
report a profit of FM133m, a substantial turnround from the FM62m loss for
the same months of 1992.
Outokumpu now intends to offer 12m new A shares and lead managers, S G
Warburg, Merrill Lynch International and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, might lift
the total to 14m.

Shares in Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems, a USM-quoted computing
services company, lost more than a quarter of their value yesterday after
interim profits sharply below expectations.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 201,000, 73 per cent lower than last time's
Pounds 753,000. The shares fell 60p to close at 163p.
Turnover increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 10.7m) and
earnings per share amounted to 1p (3.1p).
Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, said the profits slide was the result of slow
trading conditions in the UK and a period of inactivity among the company's
agents in mainland Europe: 'Most of our new European business partners
decided to invest seriously in sales and marketing activity only after the
summer holiday period and we failed to anticipate the extent to which this
would cause a deferral of first-half sales,' he said.
He said the company's US subsidiary had shown rapid growth, trebling
software sales from Dollars 2.1m to Dollars 6.1m (Pounds 4.09m). The
Australian subsidiary had performed well, although below budget.
Mr Burchett said he expected significant improvement in the second half of
the year and that profits for the whole year would be broadly similar to
last year's Pounds 1.8m.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: On Demand Info gets Pounds 39.8m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A price of 78p was yesterday fixed for the flotation of On Demand
Information valuing the electronic publishing company at Pounds 39.8m.
ODI delivers a range of information such as directories, manuals, magazines
and brochures via a computer terminal instead of the printed form. The
company said that the information appears on the screen in exactly the same
format as it does on paper.
Albert Sharp, its broker, has placed with institutions 12.75m shares, 25 per
cent of the expanded capital. The flotation will raise Pounds 9.15m, net of
expenses, for the company.
The prospectus, printed in Bradford, was delayed by poor traffic conditions
due to fog which meant no balance sheet figures were available at time of
going to print. No profits forecast has been made.
Analysts said the figures available suggested the company would continue to
make losses for at least 18 months. It incurred operating losses of Pounds
803,000 (Pounds 113,000) in the year to July 31.
The company, which has been the subject of some adverse press comment, was
started five years ago as a division of Poulter Communications, a large
media communications group, the bulk of which is remaining in private
control.
No existing shareholders have sold in the placing and directors and their
families have retained a 48.2 per cent stake. Mr Graham Poulter, ODI's
chairman and founder of Poulter Communications, holding 40 per cent with his
family trusts. Existing shareholders have undertaken not to sell their stock
for two years.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swithland in receivership as debts total
Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swithland Group, the new and used car dealership, has shocked the City by
going into receivership with debts of about Pounds 17m less than two weeks
since it failed to float on the Stock Exchange.
Directors of the Leicester-based company had forecast in the prospectus
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.69m shortly before the October 31 year-end. The
last audited accounts available, provided up to June 30 this year, were
unqualified by Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Shares were priced at 81p each and had the float gone ahead the company
would have been valued at about Pounds 21m. The placing, sponsored by Ionian
Corporate Finance and not underwritten, attracted some adverse press
comment. Ionian, a small City firm, said: 'We were shocked when we were
informed that receivers had been appointed.'
City concern about Swithland, where the first 50 of 330 employees have been
made redundant, appeared to increase following reports about its brushes
with the Office of Fair Trading on questions of consumer credit regulation
and other matters.
But institutions were also said to have been worried by net cash outflows
before financing in 1990, 1992 and the eight months to June 30 as well as
increase in debtors. A pre-financing net cash outflow of Pounds 3.16m is
recorded for the eight months ended June 30.
The issue lapsed when brokers to the placing, Harris Allday Lea &amp; Brooks,
were unable to place an agreed minimum of 48 per cent of 18.5m shares, or 67
per cent of the 26.4m total share capital, by November 12.
The receiver, Mr Myles Halley, an accountant with KPMG in Leicester, said he
had been appointed on Thursday afternoon with the agreement of all its
financial backers which include Lloyds Bank, County NatWest and the Bank of
Wales.
He said: 'Following on so soon from a possible flotation, a company going
into receivership means secured and unsecured creditors will require a full
investigation to be completed on how the company ended up in receivership in
such a short period of time.'
He added that the company had been 'very highly geared' and that following
the failure to float, creditors had experienced a 'major loss of confidence'
and increased pressure on the company.
He said it was difficult to assess the precise extent of the company's
liabilities accurately but these were roughly Pounds 17m. In the prospectus
net secured debt was put at Pounds 12m on September 24.
The receivers are offering all 16 sites for sale.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Marked expansion at Perpetual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Perpetual yesterday jumped 49p to 780p after the UK authorised and
Jersey-based offshore unit trust group reported sharply higher annual
profits and hoisted its dividend.
Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman of the Henley-based group, said the profits rise -
from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 14.7m pre-tax - emanated from improved stock
market sentiment and lower interest rates which stimulated demand for unit
trusts.
The performance in the 12 months to September 30 was achieved on turnover
ahead from Pounds 246.6m to Pounds 842m.
Mr Arbib said the group enjoyed a 'significant increase' in its share of an
expanded market.
Net new investments amounted to Pounds 750m and this, coupled with rising
stock markets and a strong investment showing, helped funds under management
jump from Pounds 846m to Pounds 2.03bn.
Reflecting the buoyant outcome, the proposed final dividend goes up from
3.6p to 13.2p, bringing the total for the year to 15p, against 4.8p.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: OMI International stages
recovery with Pounds 237,000
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMI International, the electro-hydraulics, logistics and electro-optics
company, returned to pre-tax profits with Pounds 237,000 in the six months
to September 30, against losses of Pounds 2.69m in the comparable period.
Turnover fell to Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 20.3m). Forward Industries, acquired
five months ago, contributed sales of Pounds 3m but the figures lacked last
time's Pounds 3.75m contribution from some design businesses which had been
sold.
'I do not anticipate any real change in trading conditions over the second
half of this financial year,' said Mr Gil Williams, chairman.
The board declared a maintained interim dividend of 0.75p, uncovered by
earnings per share of 0.5p (6.1p losses), on the back of results slightly
ahead of expectations and as a measure of 'quiet optimism' about prospects.
Sales in the logistics services businesses fell due to lower spares support
activity, in spite of a 30 per cent increase in newer technology products.
Trading profits improved 17 per cent to Pounds 385,000 on sales down at
Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 6.45m).
The company said the design business was unlikely to make a loss in the
second half, but reported operating losses of Pounds 252,000 (Pounds
177,000) this time, on sales down at Pounds 4.58m (Pounds 6.27m).
Forward had performed well and the other manufacturing businesses were
healthy with profits for the division climbing to Pounds 652,000 (Pounds
504,000) on sales up at Pounds 4.12m (Pounds 3.81m).
Interest payable climbed to Pounds 242,000 (Pounds 96,000), including an
extra Pounds 100,000 for the loan taken out to cover the Forward
acquisition.
Net borrowings and finance leases rose to Pounds 6.64m (Pounds 2.59m) giving
gearing of 49.6 per cent, with the increase mainly attributable to Forward.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Two more against Volvo-Renault
link

<TEXT>
The momentum sought by Volvo for the proposed merger of its car and truck
operations with France's Renault slowed yesterday when two shareholders
announced their rejection of the deal.
Fund 92-94, a state-owned investment institution which holds 2.5 per cent of
Volvo's voting capital, and Foreningsbanken's investment fund, which holds
0.7 per cent, both cited concerns about the privatisation of Renault in
their decisions to vote against the merger at a special shareholders'
meeting on December 7.
Their stance still left the opposition camp trailing well behind the votes
in favour following the decision on Thursday to support the deal by the
Fourth Fund state pension fund and the Folksam insurance company, two of the
biggest institutional shareholders.
Last night, Volvo could count on about 30 per cent of the voting stock,
including Renault's 10 per cent and 9 per cent held by Volvo sister
companies. Institutions definitely committed to voting against the deal hold
4.5 per cent.
Aktiespararna, the small shareholder's association and a critic of the
merger, estimates its members have 6 per cent of the votes, but it is
unclear how many proxies it will hold.
A group of eight Swedish institutions, controlling close to 30 per cent of
the votes, have yet to make their final decisions. Three of these, the
insurance groups Skandia, Trygg-Hansa and SPP, which together hold 9.6 per
cent, previously expressed opposition. Their final positions are expected
next week.
Volvo wants to achieve a clear majority, partly to fend off the threat of a
legal challenge from Aktiespararna which says the merger requires a change
in Volvo's articles of association, a move that would need a two-thirds
majority rather than a simple majority.
Fund 92-94 and Foreningsbanken said their concerns about the uncertainties
surrounding the privatisation of Renault had not been allayed by assurances
from the French government that it intended selling off its 65 per cent
share in the merged company by the end of next year and would not use a
planned golden share to dilute Volvo's 35 per cent share.
A split within the trade unions at Volvo deepened yesterday when SIF, the
white collar union whose 5,000 Volvo members are strongly opposed to the
Renault merger, quit the joint union negotiating committee it sat on with
the blue collar unions, which support the deal.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bourse to probe Euro Disney
share trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris stock market authorities have launched a formal inquiry into the
recent volatility of the shares in Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group
desperately trying to negotiate a financial restructuring package.
Euro Disney's shares have for the past fortnight been under surveillance by
the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French market watchdog. This
followed a sharp fall in the shares on November 10 when Euro Disney
disclosed an unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr5.3bn for the year ended
September.
The COB is investigating the circumstances behind the share price movements
to see whether there was an unauthorised leak of information. Another area
of investigation is the suspension of the shares on various European
markets. The shares were suspended in Brussels before Paris, but continued
trading in London.
An official said the COB was also scrutinising this week's sharp
fluctuations in Euro Disney shares. The shares, which were worth FFr43.7
before the loss announcement, had fallen to a low of FFr27.02 by the end of
trading this Wednesday. The shares then rallied on Thursday and yesterday
rose again to close FFr1.5 higher at FFr30.9.
Meanwhile the 60 international banks that hold Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn net
debt are finalising discussions for the formation of a steering committee to
represent them in the restructuring negotiations with Euro Disney and Walt
Disney, its US parent company. The creditors include Citibank, Deutsche
Bank, JP Morgan, National Westminster, Mitsubishi Trust and Barclays.
The steering committee is expected to have 11 members and to be led by
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) or Banque Indosuez, the French banks.
The Euro Disney banks are believed to have rejected a proposal to form three
separate committees - to handle the three different categories of the
company's debt - in favour of setting up a single negotiating body.

Net profit for Thai Airways International (Thai) fell 67 per cent in the
year to September, dropping to Bt1.02bn (Dollars 40.2m) from Bt3.07bn in
1992, the company announced yesterday.
Thai, partially privatised and listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand last
year, acknowledged that results were below budget - only last month it
predicted net profit of about Bt1.9bn - but described them as 'satisfactory'
in the light of the global recession.
Thai's regional flights in Asia are profitable, but intercontinental and
domestic services have performed poorly.
Operating revenue, boosted by an improvement in the tourist trade, rose 6.5
per cent to Bt58.58bn but operating expenses were up 7.3 per cent to
Bt53.95bn, pushing operating profit down 2.6 per cent to Bt4.63bn;
unexplained 'other expenses' reduced pre-tax profit 68 per cent to Bt1.38bn.
Thai's shares have performed poorly since the privatisation and are only now
approaching the initial public offering price of Bt60.
The airline planned to complete a reform of its accounting system by next
month with the help of KPMG Peat Marwick Suthee to produce an accounting
format more familiar to foreign investors.
'This is considered essential as Thai still needs more funding from overseas
to reduce the company's interest costs,' Thai said. Mr Thamnoon Wanglee,
Thai president, has said Thai is considering issuing debentures with
warrants or a convertible bond.
Load factor for the year was over 64 per cent, and Mr Thamnoon predicted
this would rise to 67 per cent in the current year. Anticipated break-even
point is 66.7 per cent, although Thai makes profits from operations other
than flights, such as airport limousine services and restaurants.
Thai has proposed the formation of a new airline for domestic flights.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japan's trust banks slide
average 44%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's seven trust banks and three long-term credit banks yesterday
completed the bleak picture for the industry by reporting sharply lower
interim profits and admitting to an increase in their non-performing loans.
Core business profits at the trust banks rose by an average 18.7 per cent in
the first half to September, as falling interest rates generated a
favourable spread, though an increase in loss provisions left the banks with
pre-tax profits down an average 43.9 per cent.
Concern about the health of the Japanese banking system is thought by
brokers to have triggered the 2.9 per cent fall in Tokyo stocks yesterday.
Investors apparently noted that the banks did not take advantage of
favourable trading conditions in the past two years to write-off losses on
loans made during the bubble era of the late 1980s.
Trust banks are heavily exposed to the troubled property market, but
generally suggested that their non-performing loans are growing less quickly
than those of the leading commercial banks, which said their problem loans
grew 9.6 per cent during the half.
The trust banks' non-performing loans expanded by an average 4.8 per cent,
though Chuo Trust and Banking had a 30.6 per cent increase and Nippon Trust
Bank 16.8 per cent. Problem loans rose by only 1.8 per cent at Mitsui Trust
and Banking, and by 1.3 per cent at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking.
But the banks use a narrow definition of 'non-performing', and do not count
loans on which interest rates have been cut to almost zero as part of a
restructuring. They also do not include the loans of affiliates for which
they may be ultimately responsible.
Yasuda Trust and Banking said its net profit fell partly because of a
Y14.6bn (Dollars 136.4m) reduction in net gains on securities and Y8.6bn in
losses on the sale of loans to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company,
established by Japanese banks this year to soak up their property-related
problem loans.
One sign of the pressure on core profits was that net interest income at
Yasuda slipped Y4.7bn during the year to a loss of Y1.2bn. The bank said
lower domestic interest rates should improve earnings during the second
half, though an increase in loan losses will work against growth in net
profits.
The three long-term credit banks reported particularly large falls in their
core business earnings, which was blamed on an accounting change that
reduced the profits generated bu discount bank debentures. Core banking
profits at the business profits slipped by an average 42.3 per cent.
The Industrial Bank of Japan and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan reported
smaller falls in net profit, achieved through the sale of securities, but
the Nippon Credit Bank saw net profits fall by 51.1 per cent to Y6.6bn.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volkswagen heads for DM2bn loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Volkswagen, Europe's leading carmaker, is heading for a DM2bn (Dollars
1.1bn) loss this year, Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, admitted yesterday.
Group capital spending budgets are to be cut by an average DM2bn annually
over the next five years to help recovery. At the same time, VW aims to save
around DM3.6bn in wage costs over the next two years with the introduction
of a four-day working week in Germany, Mr Piech said.
But he gave no indication of when he expected the group, which includes the
VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat brands, to return to profit. The group made a net
profit of DM147m in 1992.
The parent company, VW AG, would break even this year after a profit of more
than DM400m in 1992, Mr Piech said.
The predicted recovery had quickly run out of steam, the company said. Group
results were hit by 'unplanned' losses at Audi, deficits in the Asia Pacific
region and North America and the 'extremely critical' developments at the
Spanish subsidiary, Seat.
Mr Piech, who until midsummer was confidently forecasting the group would be
turned round this year after an 87 per cent profits dive in 1992, placed
most of the blame for the slide into the red on events at Seat.
Continuing negotiations with Spanish union and government officials on the
closure of Seat's Barcelona factory and the loss of 9,000 jobs there, gave
ground for 'the greatest concern', Mr Piech said.
The group planned to spend DM600m on restructuring the Spanish business,
adding to the burdens of the DM1.25bn loss already announced, and a planned
DM1.5bm cash injection to save it from collapse.
VW's rolling five-year capital investment programme in the automotive
business, already reduced from DM50bn to DM45bn earlier this year, will be
cut to just DM35bn for the period to the end of 1998, officials said.
Spending on the financial services divisions is to be cut from DM34bn to
DM30.5bn.
VW also claimed yesterday that independent investigations had found no proof
to support suspicions of industrial espionage against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, the ex-General Motors director who joined VW last March.
But an abbreviated version of a report by auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand,
distributed yesterday, said investigators had failed fully to clarify the
events in late March when, according to VW, 20 cartons of Mr Lopez's
'personal' papers were shredded on his orders.
Carefully-worded VW statements said no evidence had been found that 'secret'
data from GM or Adam Opel, the US group's German subsidiary, had been
'available or used' at the company.
Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, yesterday accused VW of 'diversionary
manoeuvres' and manipulating and confusing public opinion.
In a statement prepared on the basis of recent selective leaks from the KPMG
report, he said VW was trying to mislead the public by acting as a judge in
its own matter.
Mr Herman pointed to Mr Lopez's contradictory sworn statements and criminal
investigations against him, and said the VW board had known for some time
that he and his followers - despite denials - 'actually had cartons of
material moved to Wolfsburg'.
VW yesterday would not answer questions relating to the suspected theft of
GM or Opel secrets by Mr Lopez or his colleagues.

FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Atlas Copco shows 24% advance at
nine months
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Atlas Copco, the Swedish industrial components group, climbed 24
per cent to SKr910m (Dollars 109.8m) in the first nine months, despite
sharply lower sales volumes in Europe.
The performance stemmed from a turnround in net financial items, aided by
lower interest rates and exchange rate gains, to offset an 8 per cent fall
in operating income.
Mr Michael Treschow, chief executive, continued to highlight the contrast
between Europe - where demand remains weak - and markets such as North and
South America, east Asia and Australia where the trend has been much better.
The group stands by a previous forecast that profits for the full year will
exceed last year's SKr1.02bn.
The weaker krona helped drive up nine-month sales by 16 per cent to
SKr13.55bn and orders by 19 per cent to SKr14.2bn.
But operating income fell to SKr826m from SKr895m, after being dragged lower
by an 8-10 per cent drop in sales volumes and higher operating expenses.
The group's compressor technique and construction and mining technique
divisions saw earnings fall, but cost-cutting enabled the industrial
technique division to improve its result despite the difficult market.
The group had financial income of SKr84m, against SKr163m in costs a year
ago. The turnround was helped by a drop in net borrowings and lower interest
rates.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Air Europe supervisors may seek
compensation from BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Supervisors to Air Europe, the leisure group that crashed in March 1991, are
considering seeking possible compensation from British Airways in connection
with the collapse of the company.
The details emerged on the day that unsecured creditors to Air Europe
received a dividend of 5.35p in the pound in efforts to provide a speedy
settlement of claims.
It emerged at the time of the Pounds 610,000 High Court settlement of BA
with Virgin Atlantic in January in connection with anti-competitive 'dirty
tricks' that Air Europe had been co-operating with Virgin.
Mr Phil Wallace, one of the supervisors from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick,
said yesterday: 'We have watched the proceedings with interest. We are still
investigating the relationship between BA and Air Europe given what came out
of the Virgin case.' He said money had been allocated to fund an
investigation. 'I am persuaded that we should continue. It is conceivable
that something could come out there.'
BA last night rejected any suggestion that there was a case to answer. 'The
reasons for Air Europe's downfall are well documented and are nothing to do
with any contact with British Airways. We continue to offer assistance to
the administrators as sought.'
Mr Wallace said the payment was likely to be in final settlement to most
creditors. It was approved by the largest 11 creditors to Air Europe - those
owed over Pounds 5m each - who have agreed to accept a lower interim
dividend of 4p in the pound. In exchange, the supervisors will incur lower
costs in communicating with the remaining 7,000 creditors, who would
otherwise have had to wait longer for the settlement of disputed claims of
over Pounds 6m.
Mr Wallace said the largest creditors could ultimately receive a dividend of
between 4p and 5.35p, depending on the outcome of 'half a dozen' disputes.
The figure for all creditors would be further boosted by any recoveries from
BA.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Merrett syndicate support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members agents at Lloyd's of London were increasingly confident yesterday
that Syndicate 418, the biggest of six syndicates managed by Merrett
Underwriting Agency Management, the Lloyd's agency, will continue
underwriting next year.
It is understood that negotiations to transfer administration of the
syndicate, one of the most important at the Lloyd's insurance market, to
another leading managing agency were well advanced last night.
It had been feared that a sharp fall in backing from members' agents - who
channel Names onto Lloyd's syndicates - would force 418 to close next year,
leaving several thousand Names with a potentially expensive bill to run-off
(meet claims on policies affecting) the syndicate's 1991, 1992 and 1993
years of account.
Members agents, who cold shouldered the Merrett syndicates earlier this
year, are thought to have offered more capacity on condition that the
syndicate's management is transferred to a new agency.
The breakthrough follows the intervention of Mr Peter Middleton, chief
executive of Lloyd's, and the creation of a steering group to co-ordinate
rescue efforts. Agents are less confident, however, about the prospects for
syndicate 1067, which is still likely to go into run-off. 1067's
underwriter, Mr Stewart Laderman joined Zurich Re, the Swiss reinsurance
company, last week.
It had already been expected that the management of four smaller Merrett
syndicates - numbers 179, 332, 1038 and 1184 - would be transferred to other
Lloyd's agencies.
Two weeks ago, Travelers Insurance of the US, withdrew a plan which would
have provided extra backing to compensate for the fall off in agency
support, plunging the group into crisis.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Stoddard Sekers falls to Pounds 167,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stoddard Sekers International, the Renfrewshire-based carpet and furnishing
fabric group, suffered a further sharp decline in profits in the six months
to September 30.
The shares fell 6p to 39p.
Although turnover improved some 8 per cent to Pounds 27.4m - reflecting the
inclusion of BMK for the full half year against just four months last time -
the pre-tax line tumbled to Pounds 167,000 (Pounds 432,000).
Mr Hugh Laughland, chairman, described the economic environment as in a
'fragile and patchy recovery mode'. Demand in the carpet industry remained
flat and any volume gains were only being achieved 'in the face of extreme
price pressure'.
However, he said that order books in the carpet companies were ahead of the
same stage of 1992.
The interim is held at 0.75p.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: The exploitation of a quirk of nature /
Preview of the Pounds 100m flotation early next year of Chiroscience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chiroscience, a pharmaceuticals discovery and manufacturing company that
specialises in single isomer drugs, has announced it is to float in
mid-January, in a Pounds 100m flotation.
Robert Fleming, the company's advisers, have decided to postpone the float
from this month to mid-January because of fatigue in the new issues market.
Chiroscience was aware it was following a string of new bio-technology
companies to market and may well have been influenced by the fact it was
following Celltech, which on Thursday completed the UK's largest new
pharmaceutical company float.
Chiroscience is another creation to emerge from Enzymatix, a creation of Mr
Chris Evans, a scientist who floated diagnostics company Celsis earlier this
year.
The board includes chief executive Mr Nowell Stebbing, veteran of US
bio-technology successes Amgen and Genentech, but he will be assuming an
executive chairman's role for health reasons.
He is replaced by Mr John Padfield, managing director of Glaxo Manufacturing
Services, who has responsibility for product development and brings
experience of new product introduction, according to Mr Stebbing.
Chiroscience, which has never made a profit, is exploiting a quirk of nature
that has caught the imagination of the big drug manufacturers. It is based
on the discovery 150 years ago by Louis Pasteur that many molecules exist in
chemically identical but physically different forms or isomers.
One example of this property - called chirality - is found in the smell of
oranges and lemons. Both fragrances are produced by chemically identical
molecules of limonene. Physically, however, the molecules are mirror images
of one another and thus generate a different smell.
The pharmaceutical companies are interested because it is widely recognised
that the active component of many drugs is found only in one of the two
chiral molecules.
The other molecule is sometimes very harmful. One of the Thalidomide
isomers, for example, was an effective sedative, but the other damaged the
developing foetus. The theory is that if only the active isomer was
synthesised, drugs would act more specifically on the cells they need to
reach.
Chiroscience's prospects were given a significant boost in June last year
when the US Food and Drug Administration said that companies developing
drugs with more than one isomer would have to carry out tests on each isomer
as well as the 'mixed' final product.
The company is pursuing three paths. Its profitable manufacturing business
is making single isomer compounds for third parties to use in their own
drugs. Among its customers are Abbott, Glaxo, Pfizer and Wellcome.
In an extension of this programme, Menarini, an Italian company, in June
signed a 10-year agreement for Chiros - as the company was then called - to
make a single isomer version of Ketoprofen, a chronic pain drug already sold
in a chiral form.
Chiroscience expects this drug, now going through registration in Spain, to
be in the market by late 1994. Mr Stebbing says there is a worldwide market
of Dollars 500m (Pounds 336m).
The second path involves development of single isomer versions of existing
drugs that are coming off patent. Because these drugs have been registered
in a form that has both isomers, Chiroscience expects its single isomer
versions to pass rapidly through the clinic and registration.
Its most advanced development is a single isomer version of Bupivacane, an
Astra product that is a long acting local anaesthetic. It is currently in
phase one of clinical trials. Chiroscience has three other single isomer
versions of existing drugs in pre-clinical trials.
Finally, Chiroscience is trying to develop single isomer drugs from original
research, concentrating on oncology, arthritis and cognitive disorders.
These products will take as long to develop as any new drug developed by
pharmaceutical companies and are only at a research stage.
Unlike many of the new bio-science companies recently floated, Chiroscience
has internally generated cash flow which will slow the rate at which the
research and development side of the business swallows money.
But the results to date demonstrate just how much hope value is already
carried in the new bio-technology and drug discovery companies.
In the six months to August 31 1993, Chiroscience's manufacturing business
generated sales of Pounds 1.34m. Profits from this area reduced the group
loss to Pounds 1.37m after a research and development spend of Pounds 1.1m.
Mr Evans expects Chiroscience to raise Pounds 35m in the flotation, most of
which will stay within the company. It is not clear to what extent Schroder
Ventures, Apax Partners, and 3i will seek an exit.
With Pounds 8m currently in the bank, partly from a private placing earlier
this year, Chiroscience does not expect to return to the market for new
funds before it is profitable in 1999, Mr Stebbing says.
This is based on the assumption that it continues to generate cash from
intermediary product manufacture and that sales of these products 'double
each year', according to Mr Stebbing.
In the short term, he expects sales to be more than Pounds 2m by the year
end and Pounds 6m in 1994.
Panmure Gordon is the broker.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bourne End purchases and rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourne End Properties is effectively trebling in size through two
acquisitions and a rights issue.
The 63 per cent stake held by Mr Leo Noe, chief executive, through his
company Vasella, will fall to 36 per cent after the deal.
The shares were suspended at 97p pending an announcement on the deal in
October, when the group announced reduced losses of Pounds 145,000 (Pounds
543,000) for the six months to end-June.
There are three elements to the deal, which will leave the group with gross
assets of Pounds 135m and net assets of Pounds 35.1m.
Bourne will acquire from Mr Noe property independently valued at Pounds 44m
and with debts totalling Pounds 33.4m. It will pay Pounds 600,000 in cash
and issue 13.9m shares at a notional price of 70p apiece.
Bourne will acquire from Dawnay Day property independently valued at Pounds
48.1m and with debts totalling Pounds 36.5m. It will pay Pounds 5.95m in
cash and an issue of 5.8m ordinary shares, also at a notional 70p.
It will make a 3-for-1 rights issue at 65p a share, fully underwritten by
Credit Lyonnais Laing, to raise approximately Pounds 16.3m before expenses.
Mr Noe is not taking up his rights; Credit Lyonnais will place the
entitlement of 15.9m shares.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Burnfield shares fall 26p after profits
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Burnfield fell by 30 per cent yesterday after the electric surface
heating and industrial controls and measurement group issued a profits
warning and said that Mr Ian Staples, chief executive, had resigned by
mutual agreement with immediate effect.
The West Midlands-based group's shares closed down 26p at 57p, a new low,
after the board forecast a Pounds 500,000 second-half pre-tax loss and said
it intends to cut the final dividend to 0.85p from 4.1p last year, making a
total for the year of 2.5p (5.75p).
The Pounds 500,000 pre-tax loss expected for the six months to December 31
mainly reflects Pounds 1.5m of non-recurring costs. The group reported a
Pounds 1.27m pre-tax profit at the interim stage so full year pre-tax
profits are expected to total Pounds 750,000.
The second-half non-recurring charges include the costs of redundancies and
reorganisation at Isopad, the surface heating business, and Budenberg, the
measurement equipment business acquired in 1991. They also cover the
withdrawal from a possible acquisition and management reorganisation costs
including a Pounds 115,000 payment to Mr Staples.
The group's main problems centre on the Budenberg pressure gauge and
calibration equipment business which has been affected by low levels of
demand in the UK and continental Europe since the first quarter, compounded
by losses incurred through the introduction of a new range of pressure
gauges.
As part of series of management and board changes Mr Clive Snowdon,
Burnfield's finance director, has been appointed managing director. Mr Brian
McGowan, the former chief executive of Williams Holdings, remains
non-executive chairman.

He asserted that the company's affairs had been or were being conducted in a
manner unfairly prejudicial to shareholders' interests. The court set a
hearing date of January 11.
Mr Woodhams' criticisms have centred on the substantial difference between
two valuations of the group's properties. He said he had asked the company
for details of the valuations but had been denied the information requested.
The action group has called for the valuations to be made available to
shareholders at the company's head office.
Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive of QMH, said 'when proposals are put to
shareholders in connection with the financial restructuring, which is
essential for the group's viability, full disclosure will be made in
accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange so that all
shareholders can vote on the merits of the proposals.'
The company used the lower figure, of Pounds 861m from valuers Jones Lang
Wootton, in its 1992 accounts. Advisers to QMH pointed out that the group's
auditors had not qualified the accounts in respect of the 1992 valuation,
only in respect of the 1991 valuation.
Another valuation is to be carried out, as at December 31 this year,
probably by Jones Lang Wootton again. Property experts think this could show
a rise in UK hotel values, but a further fall in those of the continental
European hotels.
Mr Woodhams' move comes ahead of the group's annual meeting on Monday, at
which some shareholders are expected to vote against adopting the annual
report. Mr Woodhams claimed the shareholders action group now represented
28m shares, 3 per cent of the total equity.
Mr John Bairstow, former chairman of QMH, who holds less than 1 per cent of
the equity, is also expected to vote against.
The company is said to be 'quietly confident' about winning the vote.
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Coppel and Mr Andrew Le Poidevin, whose
remuneration packages have drawn criticism, had both been offered higher
salaries when originally appointed by the previous directors. The total
remuneration package of the new board is less than half that received by the
previous board.

FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BM dives Pounds 116m into the red - Chief
executive resigns as restructuring provisions unexpectedly soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the debt-laden engineering company, yesterday announced greater
than expected restructuring provisions and write-downs leaving it with a
Pounds 116.6m pre-tax loss for the year to June 30, against a profit of
Pounds 34.6m.
The company also announced the resignation of its chief executive Mr Howard
Sutton, one of the last remaining directors behind the acquisition strategy
which burdened the group with debt of some Pounds 160m.
Mr Sutton, who was on a three-year rolling contract with a salary of Pounds
200,000, will be replaced by Mr Cliff Walker, formerly of Dunlop and BTR. Mr
Sutton will remain as deputy chairman until April.
BM blamed its misfortunes on the acquisition in 1990 of Blackwood Hodge, the
construction equipment distributor, for Pounds 54m and a further Pounds 118m
in associated borrowings. The difficulty was compounded by the subsequent
purchase of Thomas Robinson, the packaging group. 'These two acquisitions
left BM in a dangerously weak position to face the recession,' said Mr Moger
Woolley, chairman.
As a result, initial estimates of a Pounds 41.6m charge to pay for the
disposal programme had proved insufficient to clinch a financial
restructuring. Further charges to pay for banking fees, additional closures,
property losses and write-downs, and wider restructuring of remaining
businesses resulted in a total hit of Pounds 119.5m.
Shareholders funds dropped from Pounds 157.5m to Pounds 60.2m.
At the operating level, BM announced profits of Pounds 16.6m, against Pounds
48.1m last time, on sales up from Pounds 519.5m to Pounds 547.2m.
Mr Walker said the group had sold some 14 businesses so far, raising about
Pounds 51m.
BM was also in advanced talks over a further six disposals, including the
Blackwood Hodge business in Canada, which were expected to raise about
Pounds 40m and eliminate roughly Pounds 24m in associated debt.
BM's debt, reported as Pounds 114m at the year end, had been reduced further
to Pounds 86m.
By the end of the disposal programme BM would comprise engineering
businesses with turnover in 1993 of Pounds 154m and profits of Pounds 11.7m.
Losses per share were 109.1p, against earnings of 25p. There is no final
dividend, leaving the interim of 0.5p for the year (5p).
The preference dividend is postponed.
COMMENT
These grim figures were wholly unexpected, but surprisingly, not unwelcome.
There would appear to be little left to sweep out of the stable. For the
first time in more than a year, BM appears to be confident it is over the
worst. Warnings of a Pounds 55m provision, due to the almost academic
write-off of goodwill on disposals, mean that the company is set for a
sizeable loss this year. However, at the operating level analysts are
looking for anything from breakeven to a relatively small deficit of Pounds
1m from continuing businesses after interest. In the short term, the shares
still appear highly speculative. Much hinges on BM actually achieving those
six disposals, particularly in Canada. After that, the downside compared to
1993's results is pretty limited.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Things can be done: Hand-wringing over the James Bulger case
is misplaced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a common human desire to seek a reason behind apparently irrational
happenings. This has been well illustrated in the response to the conviction
this week of two 11-year-old boys for the killing of Liverpool toddler James
Bulger.
In the UK, most newspapers and television stations have analysed in great
detail the events which led to the abduction and brutal murder of the 2 1/2
 year-old. Experts have proffered their explanations. The case has led news
bulletins across the world.
The search for a reason has ranged widely. Horror videos have been blamed,
because of similarities between what happened to James Bulger and the events
in Child's Play 3, a video borrowed by the father of one of the boys less
than a month before the murder.
Also blamed have been the witnesses who testified at the trial to having
seen the boys leading the abducted toddler on his 2 1/2 -mile via dolorosa
through Liverpool streets to the place where he was killed. Their failure to
intervene effectively has been seen as symptomatic of an uncaring society in
which stepping by on the other side is regarded as prudent behaviour.
Society has also come in for criticism for creating a 'lost generation of
children', the offspring of an urban underclass trapped in a cycle of
poverty, violence and deprivation.
Finally, there is the question of evil. Such events encourage those who see
the old Adam reappearing, a return of the blacker side of human nature.
Yet there is nothing new in the ability of humans to inflict suffering on
others. In civil wars from Cambodia to Somalia, young children have become
involved in vicious fighting and atrocities.
Children who kill other children are rare outside the circumstances of war -
but they are not unknown in countries such as the US and UK.
The most notorious UK case until the James Bulger murder was that of Mary
Bell, the 11-year-old from Newcastle upon Tyne accused in 1968 of strangling
two boys aged three and four. She was found guilty of manslaughter on
grounds of diminished responsibility after being acquitted of murder.
As in 1993, the baleful influence of television was cited as a cause of
violent behaviour. Mary Bell said that she learnt that squeezing the throat
led to death from The Saint, a TV series based on Leslie Charteris's
detective novels.
It would be foolish to deny a link between television (or video, or film)
and criminal acts. Those who spend millions of pounds on advertising believe
with justification that visual images can affect individuals' behaviour.
There will be some impressionable individuals who will copy what they see.
But it would be hard to prove such people would not behave violently if
access to such images was denied.
In any case, there are other factors surrounding the Bulger case which are
more readily susceptible to policy initiatives that would prevent young
people developing a violent bent. Chief among these are the circumstances
within which the two boys broke free of parental authority and slipped
through the normal framework of social control which might have restrained
them.
In one family, the mother - separated from her husband - was prone to
marching her son into the local police station for chastisement because she
was unable to discipline him. In the other, violence was routinely
perpetrated on younger children by older ones - and by the father until his
departure. One child in the family was in care and another had asked for the
same treatment.
Here, clearly, were children in need of help. Support for the family could
have been offered within their existing homes if that was appropriate. With
families completely unable to cope it might be better to give the children a
secure environment outside the home.
Both boys also appeared to have escaped the authority of their school, the
other fixed point of their lives. One child had missed more than half the
sessions in the two months before the murder. Both were seen as difficult to
teach.
Much more could be done to stop truanting and ensure that children are not
allowed to become outlaws before reaching the age of 10. Schools which have
tackled truancy have found that assigning staff to chasing up absent pupils
promptly can make real inroads into the problem. Truancy league tables -
published by the government for the first time last week - could be used as
a lever to encourage other schools to follow suit.
Once in school, children from especially deprived homes have special needs
which may require very much greater resources than are presently offered.
Such measures would not be cheap - especially if the help were to be of the
quality which most people would aspire to offer their own children. Keeping
a child in residential care can cost from Pounds 15,000 a year upwards -
much more in difficult cases. Dealing effectively with special needs may
require one teacher per pupil.
Intervention would have to be applied with more sensitivity than has been
shown in some recent childcare cases. The actions of social workers in
recent cases of alleged child abuse have been unacceptably heavy-handed and
intrusive. But that should not undermine the basic premise of social work:
that intervention can, literally, save lives.
Such policies offer some prospect of breaking the downward spiral of lost
parental authority, failure at school and criminal behaviour. If society is
not prepared to pay the cost of such measures, then there is nothing else to
do but to wring our hands.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: VAT would hit UK printers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A better reason than possible poor publicity for the chancellor to
refrain from imposing VAT on books, magazines and newspapers is the ease
with which such a tax could be avoided.
No VAT is levied on imported postal packets with a value of up to Pounds 15
 -a sum in excess of the price of single copies of most magazines and many
books. Publishers and book clubs may, therefore, legitimately supply their
UK customers with VAT-free publications by collecting subscriptions and
mailing from outside the European Union. The practice would be
cost-efficient only were the printing to be done outside the EU too.
If the present chancellor accepts former chancellor, Nigel Lawson's, advice
he will inflict severe damage on the printing industry, not to mention
newsagents and bookshops, and fail to collect the revenue he expects.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Who gets paid, and when
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JULIA STOUT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stewart Dalby states in his article 'Agents move into the driving seat'
(Management, November 24) that 'principals will no longer be able to delay
paying their agents simply because they have not been paid'.
While the regulations are by no means clear (on this point as on many
others), the view that we have taken is that principals can delay paying
their agents until after they have been paid by their customers provided
they have done everything they need to do; it is only where the principal
has not performed his side of the sale transaction on time that payment may
be due to the agent regardless of whether the principal has been paid.
With respect, this seems the more logical interpretation. The new rules are
sufficiently onerous to principals without seeking to make them more so.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Long march to a private bathroom: China's crumbling
infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Xin Xiao, a Beijing housewife, wanted a telephone installed it proved
no simple task. After paying a deposit of nearly USDollars 1,000 she waited
in vain for more than six months.
Exasperated, she followed the advice of friends and showered phone company
officials with gifts. 'It worked,' she said. 'Within a short time a phone
was installed.'
Madam Xin's story is familiar in China these days. Growing affluence is
bringing with it an insatiable demand for services taken for granted in the
west. Not long ago, a private telephone was an almost unimaginable luxury
for all but the most privileged.
A hard-pressed official at the Beijing Telephone Bureau said that the crush
of orders for phones in some areas was so great that the company had closed
the books on new applications temporarily.
China's economic boom is exerting huge pressures on a crumbling
infrastructure. Its roads, railways, ports and airports are proving
inadequate, and plans unveiled this week to spend Dollars 140bn by the year
2000 on a crash programme to upgrade facilities will scarely ease the
difficulties.
The authorities are also having to grapple with the rapidly rising
expectations of consumers, who long ago ceased to be satisfied with the
so-called 'three bigs' (big luxuries) of the Maoist era - a watch, sewing
machine and bicycle.
Even the 'three bigs' of the Dengist period - washing machine, refrigerator
and colour TV set - are now almost standard in many urban households.
For millions of city-dwellers housing (or lack of it), remains their
greatest problem. China's 2m newly-wed couples annually are obliged in some
cases to wait years before being allocated dwellings. Construction of
low-cost housing lags far behind demand. It is an extraordinary statistic,
but in Shanghai, China's largest city, not one floor of additional housing
was built in the Cultural Revolution years of 1966-76. And during this
period the city's population grew by several millions.
According to a report prepared for China's Commission on Economic
Restructuring, there were, in late 1992, 8m families which had no houses or
were having housing problems. 'After acquiring enough to eat and wear, the
people have developed a strong desire to improve their housing conditions.
The increasing demand has made the problem . . . more acute,' the report
said.
Simple requirements such as a private bathroom are at a premium for many
Chinese families, including government employees holding responsible
positions. Work units provide bathing facilities several times a week and,
failing that, public bath houses are available.
Among the myriad frustrations for Chinese households - from overcrowded
buses and trains to poor facilities for schooling - power shortages are one
of the worst. Areas of Beijing suffer frequent black-outs, and in some
suburbs power supplies are too feeble to fuel appliances like microwave
ovens. The World Energy Council, a body monitoring the power sector, reports
that electricity demand in China exceeds supply by about 20 per cent. With
China's economy growing this year by 13 per cent, and with projected growth
of 8-9 per cent annually for the rest of this century, there is little early
prospect of the problem being solved in spite of heavy investment in the
power sector.
Telecommunications is a priority but the case of Madam Xin and her problems
with the telephone bureau reveals how far there is to go before China's 35
main urban centres, let alone far-flung areas, are blessed with an adequate
telephone system. China's ratio of people to telephones exceeds 100,
compared with 1.6 in Hong Kong, 2.2 in Singapore, 2.8 in Taiwan and 2.8 in
South Korea. The ratio in the UK is 1.9. China has about 17m phone lines,
and aims to increase this to 100m by 2000.
Difficulties in securing a private telephone have proved a bonanza for
manufacturers of paging machines and cellular phones, such as Motorola. In
Beijing alone, according to a Motorola executive, there are 600,000 pagers,
equivalent to about one for every 15 people. Cellular phones in the Chinese
capital number more than 20,000.
If the telecommunications system is overstretched, stresses on the
transportation sector are hardly less severe. China's hard-pressed railways
rank first internationally in terms of utilisation, with load intensity
averaging 25.79m tons per kilometre.
Likewise, China's roads are barely adequate for a country a fraction of its
size. Road coverage is only about one-sixth that of the US. Less than 6 per
cent of China's 662,500 miles of roads are rated above 'second class'. It
has no trunk highways linking east and west, north and south, and existing
roads are clogged with trucks, cars, animal-drawn carts, bicycles and
pedestrians. Average speed on the main roads is between 19 and 25mph.
Nearly 60,000 people died on the roads last year. According to the Beijing
Review, a weekly news magazine, fatalities per 10,000 vehicles (China has 7m
vehicles) is '20 to 30 times that in developed countries'.
China's airports and ports are also severely stretched. Demand for aircraft
seats far outstrips supply - passenger traffic is expected to grow by 25 per
cent this year - and airports are ill-equipped to cope with the boom.
Only a small proportion of China's airports are equipped with sophisticated
instrument landing systems, which means flights are often cancelled due to
bad weather, throwing an overburdened system into further chaos. A rash of
accidents has drawn attention to lax safety standards.
The airline industry estimates China will need to import 50 to 100 passenger
aircraft annually to the year 2000 to keep pace with demand. But this is
placing a huge strain on staff training. Last year, China acquired 56
aircraft, which created positions for 500 new pilots, but training
facilities produce just 100 pilots a year.
Ports are also heavily congested. Plans to double capacity by the year 2000
will go some way towards easing pressures but, if China's economy continues
to grow at projected rates, long delays are set to continue.
Beijing Review reported recently the ratio between ships in port and those
waiting outside was 1 to 1.2. In 1992, grain carriers were obliged to wait
at anchor for 26 days on average, incurring total compensation for delays of
Dollars 55m.
Traffic jams outside China's ports, like those at its airports and on its
roads, are a symptom of an economy undergoing an extraordinarily rapid
transformation.
The situation is likely to get worse before its gets better. As Mr Cheng
Yongde, a senior engineer at Beijing's Institute for Urban Design, said of
congestion on Beijing's roads. 'We haven't encountered the real challenge
yet: when the masses start to drive their own cars, then we'll have a real
mess.'
